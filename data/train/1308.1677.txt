    "the bright , point - like , non - nuclear x - ray sources in nearby galaxies with x - ray ( 0.3 - 10.0 kev ) luminosities in the range of a few@xmath110@xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 are known as the ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "their variability on short timescales ( some ulxs vary on timescales of the order of a few minutes ) combined with high x - ray luminosities suggests that these sources are powered by accretion of matter onto black holes ( this excludes the x - ray bright supernovae : see , for example , immler & lewin 2003 ) .",
    "but the masses of these black holes is still controversial .",
    "the current arguments suggest that ulxs are either powered by stellar - mass black holes ( stmbh : mass range of 3 - 50 m@xmath4 ) accreting matter via a super - eddington mechanism ( e.g. , krding et al .",
    "2002 ; king et al . 2001 ; begelman 2002 ; gladstone et al . 2009 ) , or that they comprise intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs : mass range of a few@xmath1(100 - 100 ) m@xmath4 ) accreting at a sub - eddington rate ( colbert & mushotzky 1999 )",
    ". there is , however , no clear consensus on either scenario .",
    "a subsample of ulxs show x - ray quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "these include ngc 5408 x-1 ( centroid frequencies of @xmath5 10 - 40 mhz : strohmayer et al .",
    "2007 ; strohmayer & mushtozky 2009 ; dheeraj & strohmayer 2012 ) , ngc 6946 x-1 ( centroid frequency of 8.5 mhz : rao et al . 2010 ) , m82 x-1 ( centroid frequencies of @xmath5 50 - 170 mhz : strohmayer & mushtozky 2003 ; dewangan et al . 2006 ; mucciarelli et al . 2006 ) and x42.3 + 59 ( centroid frequencies of 3 - 4 mhz : feng et al .",
    "in particular , the qualitative nature of the power density spectra ( pds ) of ngc 5408 x-1 , ngc 6946 x-1 and m82 x-1 is similar and can be described by a flat - topped , band - limited noise breaking to a power - law with qpos evident on the power - law portion of the pds , close to the break .",
    "this behavior is strikingly similar to the pds of stmbhs , when they exhibit the so - called `` type - c '' low - frequency qpos ( lfqpos : frequency range of @xmath5 0.2 - 15 hz ) .",
    "however , the crucial difference is that the characteristic frequencies within the pds of the ulxs , viz . , the break frequency and the centroid frequency of the qpos are scaled down by a factor of approximately 10 - 100 compared to the stmbhs with type - c lfqpos .",
    "it has thus been argued that the mhz qpos ( 10 - 200 mhz ) of ulxs are the analogs of the type - c lfqpos of stmbhs and that the observed difference in the characteristic frequencies ( a few@xmath1(0.01 - 0.1 ) hz compared with a few hz ) is due to the presence of massive black holes ( @xmath6 mass of the stmbhs ) within the ulx systems .    furthermore , it has been established recently ( e.g. , mchardy et al .",
    "2006 ; krding et al . 2007 ) that the break frequency of the pds of stmbhs and super - massive black holes scales inversely with the mass of the black hole ( after accounting for the differences in the luminosities , i.e. , accretion rate of the sources ) .",
    "in addition , it is known that the centroid frequency of the lfqpos of stmbhs scales directly with the break frequency of the pds ( wijnands & van der klis 1999 ; klein - wolt & van der klis 2008 ) .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the centroid frequency of the type - c lfqpos and its analogs , if any , in ulxs & agn should scale with the mass of the host black hole .",
    "however , the lfqpos of stmbhs are variable and occur in a wide range of frequencies ( @xmath5 0.2 - 15 hz ) .",
    "but , combining spectral information has proven to be useful .",
    "one of the distinctive features of the type - c lfqpos of stmbhs is that their variable centroid frequency is strongly correlated with the index of the power - law component of the energy spectrum .",
    "the trend can be described as an increase in the power - law index with increase in the centroid frequency of the qpo with an evidence for either a turn - over or saturation , i.e. , decrease or constancy of the power - law index with increase in the qpo centroid frequency , beyond a certain high qpo frequency ( see figure 10 of vignarca et al .",
    "therefore , at a given value of the energy spectral power - law index , the qpo frequency scales directly with the mass of the black hole .",
    "hence , under the assumption that a mhz qpo from a certain ulx is an analog of the type - c lfqpos of stmbhs , its black hole mass can be estimated by measuring the qpo frequency from the pds and the power - law index from its energy spectrum .",
    "this method of constraining the masses of ulxs has been employed by several authors .",
    "dewangan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) constructed the pds of m82 x-1 using the longest available _ xmm - newton _ observation and detected a qpo with a centroid frequency of @xmath5 114 mhz . during this observation they found that the index of the power - law component of the energy spectrum was @xmath5 2 .",
    "assuming that these two quantities correlate in a similar manner to that observed in the stmbh binaries xte j1550 - 564 and grs 1915 + 105 , they obtained a mass range of 25 - 500 m@xmath4 from scaling the respective qpo centroid frequencies . in the same way , rao et al .",
    "( 2010 ) estimated a mass range of ( 1 - 4)@xmath11000 m@xmath4 for the black hole in ngc 6946 x-1 .",
    "finally , strohmayer & mushotzky ( 2009 ) found that both the pds and the x - ray energy spectra of ngc 5408 x-1 are qualitatively similar to those of stmbhs when they are in the so - called steep power - law ( spl ) accretion state . using the qpo centroid frequency  energy spectral power - law index relations of five reference stellar - mass black holes in the spl state , they used qpo frequency scaling to estimate a mass of @xmath0 a few@xmath11000 m@xmath4 for ngc 5048 x-1 .",
    "it is crucial to realize that all the current black hole mass estimates of ulxs , that rely on scaling qpo frequencies at a given power - law index , assume that the mhz qpos seen in ulxs are the analogs of the type - c lfqpos of stmbhs . in this article",
    ", we test this hypothesis in the case of ulx m82 x-1 , by investigating if its qpos show the same characteristic behavior of type - c lfqpos of stmbhs , i.e. , _ whether m82 x-1 s qpo frequency is correlated with the power - law index of its energy spectrum_. similar attempts have been made earlier by fiorito & titarchuk ( 2004 ) for the case of m82 x-1 and more recently by dheeraj & strohmayer ( 2012 ) for the case of ngc 5408 x-1 .",
    "the work by fiorito & titarchuk ( 2004 ) considered only one _ xmm - newton _ observation and three _ rxte / pca _ observations and was severely limited by the observed variability of m82 x-1 s qpo frequencies , i.e , 50 - 100 mhz .",
    "in addition , they did not consider the contamination by a nearby bright x - ray source ( source 5/x42.3 + 59 ) in their spectral modeling .",
    "here we include analysis using all of the archival _ xmm - newton _ observations that show qpos in the frequency range of 36 mhz ( the lowest ever reported from m82 x-1 ) to 210 mhz ( the highest qpo frequency reported from m82 x-1 ) .",

    "we describe all the _ xmm - newton _ observations used in the present study and carry out surface brightness modeling of their mos1 images . in section 3 , we show results from our timing and energy - dependent surface brightness modeling analysis .",
    "we also show the two primary results of this article : ( 1 ) evidence for a correlation between the average count rate and the centroid frequency of the qpo and ( 2 ) no apparent correlation between the centroid frequency of the qpo and the hardness ratio which is an indicator of the power - law index of the energy spectrum . in section 4 , we compare these results with stmbhs with type - c qpos .",

    "2001 ) . in principle , the flux contribution from all these point sources can bias the modeling of m82 x-1 .",
    "chiang & kong ( 2011 ) have analyzed all of the archival _ chandra _ observations of m82 to study the long - term ( 1999 - 2007 ) variability of the x - ray point sources within m82 .",

    "however , source 5 ( as defined in matsumoto et al .",
    "2001 ) is an exception .",
    "it can reach x - ray luminosities comparable to m82 x-1 ( feng & kaaret 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , to estimate the amount of contamination by source 5 in each of the observations , we carried out surface brightness modeling of the images assuming they are dominated by two point sources .",
    "we used only the mos1 data for the purposes of surface brightness modeling .",
    "this is due to the fact that the mos data offers the finest pixel size of 1.1  compared to the 4.1  of the epic - pn .",
    "furthermore , the image resolution of epic - pn is close to the separation ( @xmath5 5  ) between source 5 and m82 x-1 ( feng & kaaret 2007 ) .",

    "we ignore the background as it was negligible in all of the six observations . for bins with less than 5 counts , we assign error bars as derived by gehrels ( 1986 ) , i.e. , 1.0 + @xmath27 ; and for bins with greater than 5 counts we assign poisson errors of @xmath28 .",

    "it is therefore likely that all the qpos reported here ( 36 - 210 mhz ) originate from m82 x-1 .    to confirm that m82 x-1 is indeed the origin of the mhz qpos reported here",
    ", we carried out the same analysis as feng & kaaret ( 2007 ) .",
    "for each observation , we divided the source region into two semi - circles , one containing the majority of the flux from m82 x-1 ( region a of the top panel of figure 4 ) and the other dominated by the flux from source 5 ( region b of the top panel of figure 4 ) .",
    "we then extracted the pds from each of these individual half - circles .",
    "the pds using only events from region a and from region b of observation 0657802301 ( with the 210 mhz qpo ) are shown in the middle and the bottom panel of figure 4 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the qpo is evident in region a which is dominated by flux from m82 x-1 .",
    "we found this to be the case in all the five observations .",
    "this analysis suggests that m82 x-1 is indeed the source of the mhz qpos .",
    "due to contamination by point sources within the psf of epic data a clean energy spectrum of m82 x-1 can not be extracted .",
    "energy spectral modeling of the previous high resolution _ chandra _ observations of m82 x-1 suggests that its x - ray spectrum can be modeled by a simple power - law ( see kaaret et al .",
    "furthermore , work by feng & kaaret ( 2007 ) indicates that the absorbing column towards the source does not change significantly between observations that are randomly spread in time .",
    "therefore , assuming the 3 - 10 kev x - ray spectrum of m82 x-1 can be modeled with a simple power - law , its hardness ratio ( say ratio of the count rates in 3 - 5 kev and the 5 - 10 kev bands ) will suffice as an indicator of the energy spectral power - law index .",
    "therefore , we extracted the hardness ratio from each of the five observations by first carrying out the surface brightness modeling  using the procedure described in section 2  in the soft ( 3 - 5 kev ) x - ray band and then in the hard band ( 5 - 10 kev ) .",
    "the resolved soft and hard count rates of m82 x-1 are indicated in the second and the fourth columns of table 3 .",
    "the corresponding hardness ratios are also shown .",
    "[ fig : figure4 ]    furthermore , we ran simulations in _ xspec _ ( arnaud 1996 ) to constrain m82 x-1 s spectral shape , i.e. , the value of its power - law index .",
    "our procedure is described as follows .",
    "first , using the _ fakeit _ command in _ xspec _ , we simulated a number of energy spectra ( 1000 in our case ) each of which was described by a simple power - law modified by absorption , i.e. , _",

    "these energy spectra spanned a wide range of power - law indicies ( 1 - 4 ) and normalizations ( 0.0001 - 0.01 ) with exposure time equal to the observing time of a given dataset .",
    "in essence , we generated a set of energy spectra as observed by epic - mos1 and each prescribed by a power - law model with index and the normalization values in the range of 1 - 4 and 0.0001 - 0.01 , respectively .",
    "from each of the five _ xmm - newton _ observations ( see table 3 ) , we calculated the mos1 count rate of m82 x-1 in seven energy bands ( 3 - 10 kev , 3 - 9 kev , 3 - 8 kev , 3 - 7 kev , 3 - 6 kev , 3 - 5 kev and 3 - 4 kev ) using surface brightness modeling technique described earlier . within the suite of simulated spectra",
    ", we searched for the energy spectra whose count rates in the above bands are equal to the measured values ( within the error bars ) from surface brightness modeling of the real image .",
    "we find that the power - law index of m82 x-1 measured this way is only weakly constrained with a value in the range of 1.3 - 1.8 .",
    "note that this is consistent with the previous _ chandra _ measurement of 1.67 ( kaaret et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the primary goal of the present work is to understand the nature of the mhz qpos from ulx m82 x-1 by testing for a timing - spectral correlation similar to that seen in stmbhs with type - c lfqpos .",
    "the basic correlation that is characteristic of type - c lfqpos in stmbhs is the dependence of the power - law index of the energy spectrum on the centroid frequency of the strongest qpo . using all of the archival _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations we detected qpos at five distinct frequencies from ulx m82 x-1 ( see section 3.1 ) . since a clean energy spectrum can not be extracted with the present data we used the hardness ratio to represent the power - law index in each of these cases ( see section 3.2 ) . compiling all the results , we find that the hardness ratio shows no apparent dependence on the centroid frequency of the qpo .",
    "we find that as the centroid frequency of the qpo increases the hardness ratio appears to be constant .",
