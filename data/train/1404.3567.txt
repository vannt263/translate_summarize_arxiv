    "today they are pursued also at much higher collision energies at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern and at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl .",
    "most probably the qgp is formed at the early stage of heavy ion collisions already at the top sps energy  @xcite .",
    "unambiguous evidence of the qgp state is , however , nearly impossible to obtain since quantitative predictions of proposed qgp signals  @xcite from the theory of strong interactions are difficult .",
    "for this reason the na49 collaboration at the cern sps has searched over the past years for signs of the onset of qgp creation in the energy dependence of hadron production properties .",
    "this search was motivated by a statistical model  @xcite showing that the onset of deconfinement should lead to rapid changes of the energy dependence of numerous experimentally detectable properties of the collisions , all appearing in a common energy domain .",

    "but , mostly due to the incomplete acceptance of detectors and not well developed data analysis tools , results on event - by - event fluctuations are not yet mature .",
    "high - quality and systematic measurements of event - by - event fluctuations are needed mostly for two reasons : +  to test statistical and dynamical models - the simplest tests at the level of fluctuations are still missing and +  to study properties of the phase transition , in particular properties of the transition at the onset of deconfinement and search for the critical point of strongly interacting matter .",
    "in this section the present and future experimental programmes related to the study of properties of the onset of deconfinement are reviewed .",
    "first , however , the history of the programme which led to the discovery of the onset of deconfinement , namely the beam energy scan programme with central pb+pb collisions at the cern sps is briefly recalled .",
    "during the period 1999 - 2002 experimental data on pb+pb collisions were recorded by several experiments ( na49 , na45 , na57 , na50 and na60 ) first at the top sps energy of 158@xmath2  gev .",
    "the primary aim of this program was to find evidence for the qgp in these reactions .",
    "results were consistent with the signals expected for the production of this new state of matter  @xcite but not unique .",
    "this led to the extension of the program to lower beam energies ( 20@xmath2 , 30@xmath2 , 40@xmath2 , 80@xmath2  gev ) in order to search for a clear onset of deconfinement which was predicted to be at the low sps energies .",
    "only na49 participated in the full energy scan .",
    "the history and the basic results of the sps energy scan programme are reviewed in the following .      in the mid 90s numerous results on collisions of light nuclei at the bnl ags ( beams of si at 14.6@xmath2  gev ) and the cern sps ( beams of o and s at 200@xmath2  gev ) were obtained . the experiments with heavy nuclei ( ags : au+au at 11.6@xmath2  gev , sps : pb+pb at 158@xmath2  gev ) were just starting .",
    "this was the time when the first look at the energy dependence of hadron production in nucleus ",
    "nucleus ( a+a ) collisions at high energies became possible .",
    "compilations , on pion production  @xcite and on strangeness production  @xcite resulted in a clear conclusion : the energy dependence of hadron multiplicities measured in a+a collisions and p+p interactions are very different . furthermore the data on a+a collisions suggested that there is a significant change in the energy dependence of pion and strangeness yields which is located between the top ags and sps energies . based on the statistical approach to strong interactions",
    "@xcite it was conjectured  @xcite that the change is related to the onset of deconfinement during the early stage of the a+a collisions .",
    "soon after , following this hypothesis , a quantitative model was developed , the statistical model of the early stage ( smes )  @xcite .",
    "it assumes creation of the early - stage matter according to the principle of maximum entropy .",
    "depending on the beam energy @xmath3 the matter is in the confined ( @xmath4 30@xmath2  gev ) , mixed ( 30@xmath2 @xmath5 60@xmath2  gev ) or deconfined ( @xmath6 60@xmath2  gev ) phases .",
    "the phase transition is assumed to be of the first order .",
    "based on these ideas the na49 collaboration proposed in 1997 to study hadron production in pb+pb collisions at 30@xmath2  gev  @xcite . at this energy",
    "the smes predicted a sharp maximum of the strangeness to pion ratio as a characteristic signal of the onset of deconfinement . following this request a 40@xmath2  gev pb ",
    "beam was delivered to na49 in 1998 as a test .",
    "the 5 weeks long run at 40@xmath2  gev took place in 1999  gev instead of the originally requested 30@xmath2  gev due to technical sps reasons . ] .",
    "data were registered by na49 , na45 , na50 and na57 .",
    "the success of this first run at low sps energy and the exciting preliminary results shown by na49 justified a continuation of the program . in 2000 a beam at 80@xmath2  gev was delivered for 5 days to na49 and na45 and the energy scan program was completed in 2002 .",
    "results of the analysis suggested that there is a significant change in the energy dependence of pion and strangeness yields which is located between the top ags and sps energies .",

    "relative strangeness production rises to a peak and then drops to a plateau at a value predicted for deconfined matter  @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the t parameter shows the step behaviour typically expected for a @xmath14 order phase transition  @xcite and the resulting softness of the equation of state in the mixed - phase regime  @xcite .",
    "models which do not assume the deconfinement phase transition ( hgm @xcite , rqmd @xcite , urqmd @xcite and hsd @xcite ) fail to describe the data . the introduction of a @xmath14 order phase transition at low sps energies ( smes @xcite and hydrodynamic evolution of the fireball  @xcite ) allow to describe the measured structures in the energy dependence of t and e@xmath10 ( see dash - dotted curves in fig .  [ onset ] ) .",
    "there are attempts to explain the results on nucleus - nucleus collisions by ( model dependent ) extrapolations of the results from proton - nucleus interactions  @xcite .",
    "as detailed enough p+a data exist only at the top ags and sps energies the extrapolations are possible only at these two energies and thus there are no predictions of the energy dependence of the quantities relevant for the onset of deconfinement ( see fig .",
    "[ onset ] ) .",
    "the underlying models are based on the assumption that particle yields in the projectile hemisphere are due to production from excited projectile nucleon(s ) .",
    "this assumption is , however , in contradiction to the recent results at rhic  @xcite and sps  @xcite energies which clearly demonstrate a strong mixing of the projectile and target nucleon contributions in the projectile hemisphere .",
    "furthermore , qualitative statements on similarity or differences between p+a and a+a reactions may be strongly misleading because of a trivial kinematic reason .",
    "the center of mass system in p+a interactions moves toward the target nucleus a with increasing a , whereas its position is a - independent for a+a collisions . for illustration",
    "several typical examples are considered .",
    "the baryon longitudinal momentum distribution in a+a collisions gets narrower with increasing a and , of course , it remains symmetric in the center of mass system .",
    "in p+a collisions it shrinks in the proton hemisphere and broadens in the target hemisphere ( for example see slide 5 in ref .",
    "thus a naive comparison would lead to the conclusion that a+a collisions are qualitatively similar to p+a interactions if the proton hemisphere is considered , or that they are qualitatively different if the target hemisphere is examined .",
    "one encounters a similar difficulty when discussing the a - dependence of particle ratios in a limited acceptance .",
    "for instance the kaon to pion ratio is independent of a in p+a interactions if the total yields are considered  @xcite , it is however strongly a - dependent in a limited acceptance ( e.g. see slides 10 and 11 in  ref .",
    "recent string - hadronic models  @xcite take all trivial kinematic effects into account and parameterize reasonably well p+p and p+a results .",
    "nevertheless they fail to reproduce the a+a data ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ onset ] ) .",
    "already in 2003 it was realized  @xcite that further progress in understanding effects related to the onset of deconfinement can only be achieved by a new comprehensive study of hadron production in proton - proton , proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the two most important open questions are :    * what is the nature of the transition from the anomalous energy dependence measured in central pb+pb collisions at sps energies to the smooth dependence measured in p+p interactions ? *",
    "is it possible to observe the predicted signals of the onset of deconfinement in fluctuations  @xcite and anisotropic flow  @xcite ?",
    "these questions motivated the present ion programme at the cern sps devoted to an extensive system size and energy scan .",
    "moreover , the programme received further urgency from the possibility to discover the critical point of strongly interacting matter .",
    "the programme was proposed to cern in november 2006  @xcite .",
    "based on this proposal , pilot data taking took place in september 2007 .",
    "the first physics data with hadron beams were recorded in 2009 and with ion beams ( secondary @xmath15be beams ) in 2011 .",
    "na61/shine  @xcite is the only experiment which records data within this programme .",
    "it is a multi - purpose facility to study hadron production in hadron - proton , hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions at the cern sps .",
    "na61/shine has greatly profited from the long development of the cern proton and ion sources , the accelerator chain , as well as the h2 beam - line of the cern north area .",
    "the latter has recently been modified to also serve as a fragment separator as needed to produce the be beams for na61/shine .",
    "numerous components of the na61/shine set - up were inherited from its predecessors , in particular , the last one , the na49 experiment .",
    "important upgrades increased the data taking rate by a factor 10 and significantly improved the capability for defining the centrality of the collisions .        the status and plans of data taking of na61/shine are summarized in fig .",

    "first , a detailed energy scan with pb+pb collisions at beam energies of 13@xmath2 , 19@xmath2 , 30@xmath2 , 40@xmath2 , 75@xmath2 , 150@xmath2  gev is planned for 2016 . within a single data - taking period ( 42 days )",
    "data at all energies can be recorded with a typical event statistics of about 10 times the one of the na49 data .",
    "this , together with the important detector upgrades , will allow to significantly decrease statistical and systematic uncertainties of results on pb+pb collisions by superseding the na49 results with new na61/shine measurements .",
    "second , high - statistics measurements of pb+pb collisions at 19@xmath2 , 40@xmath2 and 150@xmath2gev / c beam energy are foreseen in the period 20172019 after upgrading the na61/shine apparatus by adding a vertex detector .",
    "they should allow to determine the energy dependence of rare processes , in particular , production of d@xmath17 mesons at the top sps energies and multi - strange hyperons in the full sps energy range .",
    "moreover measurements of di - muon production in the sps energy range is considered by two proto  collaborations , na60 + and chic  @xcite .      in parallel to the na61/shine programme the beam energy scan ( bes ) programme at the bnl rhic was proposed  @xcite .",
    "both programmes were motivated by the na49 results on the onset of deconfinement and the possibility to observe the critical point ( cp ) of strongly interacting matter .",
    "the present goal of the bes programme related to the onset of deconfinement is summarized in ref .",
    "the aim is to find whether ( and where in collision energy ) the key qgp signatures observed at the top rhic energy will turn off",

    "the disappearance of a single signature would not be enough to claim the onset of deconfinement , because there are other phenomena not related to deconfinement which may cause a similar effect .",
    "however , the modification or disappearance of several signatures simultaneously would definitely provide a compelling case .",

    "models of hadron production in relativistic a+a collisions can be divided into three basic groups : transparency , mixing , and reflection models ( see ref .",

    "one can probe different regions of the phase diagram by varying the collision energy and size of colliding nuclei @xcite .",

    "the average sizes of the created physical systems and their fluctuations are expected to be rather different ( see previous section  [ npflct ] ) .",
    "this strongly affects the observed fluctuations , i.e. the measured quantities would not describe the local physical properties of the system but rather reflect the system size fluctuations .",
    "for instance , a+a collisions with different centralities may produce a system with approximately the same local properties ( e.g. the same temperature and baryonic chemical potential ) but with the volume changing significantly from interaction to interaction .",
