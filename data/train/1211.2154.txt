    "the former bound is found when cmb measurements from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) are combined with information on the distribution of galaxies based on a catalog of photometric galaxy redshifts in sloan digital sky survey iii data release eight ( sdss dr8 ) , and with the most recent measurement of the hubble parameter from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",

    "cosmological probes have been extensively exploited in the literature to set bounds on the relativistic energy density of the universe in terms of the effective number of neutrinos @xmath2 ( see refs .",
    "measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies at arc - minute angular scales from the south pole telescope ( spt )  @xcite and the atacama cosmology telescope ( act )  @xcite , when combined with other cosmological data sets have provided the constraint @xmath10 at @xmath11 cl  @xcite ) , showing evidence for @xmath12 at more than @xmath13 and suggesting values higher than those expected in the canonical scenario . if the effective number of neutrino species @xmath2 is larger than the standard model prediction , i.e.  if @xmath14 during the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) era , the hubble expansion rate will be larger , causing therefore weak interactions to freeze out earlier . the standard bbn predictions for light element abundances will change .",
    "current analyses of the observed primordial abundances indicate best - fit values of @xmath15  @xcite , and bounds @xmath16 at @xmath11 cl , depending on the assumptions on the fiducial cosmology , and are consistent with the canonical @xmath17 .",
    "nevertheless , the extra radiation species do not necessarily feature thermal abundances at bbn  @xcite so that the true number of additional species could possibly be larger than the effective number defined in terms of thermal abundances .    here",
    "we follow a general approach and study the constraints on several neutrino scenarios with the most recent available cosmological data .",
    "we consider both standard neutrino scenarios with three active massive neutrinos as well as more general , non - standard schemes with @xmath2 massless or @xmath2 massive species .",
    "of the two scenarios with free number of neutrino species , @xmath18 , the latter one is the most realistic and appropriate scenario , since we know observationally that neutrinos have mass .",
    "however , this scenario has been explored much less in the literature than the case of @xmath18 neutrinos with mass fixed to zero ( although see , e.g. , @xcite and the very recent @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , we will show that in the scenario with @xmath2 massive neutrino species , the neutrino constraints from some combinations of cosmological data sets are much worse than in the other two simpler schemes where one of the two parameters is kept fixed .",
    "this highlights the danger of neglecting neutrino mass .    in each of the three scenarios analysed here",
    ", we shall study the impact of each data set separately , devoting special attention to parameter degeneracies and to the impact of galaxy clustering data .",
    "we shall also study the preferred values of @xmath2 arising from our different numerical studies . as stated above ,",
    "@xmath2 has been claimed to be larger than the standard model expectation in a plethora of cosmological data analyses .",
    "we shall see that using up - to - date cosmological data , the evidence for @xmath4 still remains at the @xmath5 level .",
    "the data sets exploited include recent measurements of the bao feature in the data release 9 ( dr9 ; @xcite ) cmass sample of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss )  @xcite , which is part of sdss - iii  @xcite with a median redshift of @xmath19  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : data ] we describe the data sets used in the numerical analyses and in sec .  [ sec : i ] the constraints on the neutrino thermal abundance @xmath2 and on the sum of their masses are presented for different combinations of data in the three schemes studied here . we draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "we shall start with the standard scenario , which is made of three massive neutrinos and put constraints on the sum of their masses @xmath20 .",
    "we therefore fix @xmath21 .",
    "current neutrino oscillation data can not distinguish between the two possible types of ordering of the neutrino mass eigenstates , i.e.  information regarding the neutrino mass hierarchy is inaccessible .",
    "while the effect of neutrino mass on the cmb is related to the total amount of energy density in the form of massive neutrinos and the individual values of the neutrino masses are irrelevant , the matter power spectrum in principle provides information on the sum of the neutrino masses as well as on the individual values of the @xmath22 s . the non - relativistic neutrino overdensities cluster at a given redshift @xmath23 only at scales where the wavenumber of perturbations is below the neutrino free streaming scale @xmath24 due to the pressure gradient , which prevents gravitational clustering ( @xmath25 is the ratio of the total matter energy density over the critical density at redshift zero ) . on spatial scales",
    "larger than the free streaming scale @xmath26 , neutrinos cluster and behave as pressureless matter ( dust ) .",
    "perturbations with comoving wavenumber larger than the free streaming scale can not grow due to the large neutrino velocity dispersion . as a consequence ,",
    "the growth rate of density perturbations decreases and the matter power spectrum is suppressed at @xmath27 . therefore , there is a clear signal on the matter power spectrum induced by the presence of neutrino masses .",
    "neutrinos of different masses will have different transition redshifts from relativistic to non - relativistic behavior , and , in principle , by exploiting the information contained on the matter power spectrum it could be possible to identify the neutrino mass hierarchy and isolate the individual neutrino masses .",
    "however , in practice , such a task has been shown to be extremely challenging  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will assume a degenerate mass spectrum .",
    "in the standard scenario with three active massive neutrinos , the parameters considered in the analysis are :    @xmath28 , \\sum m_\\nu\\}~,\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the physical baryon and cold dark matter densities , @xmath31 is the ratio between the sound horizon and the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath32 is the optical depth , @xmath33 is the scalar spectral index , @xmath34 is the amplitude of the primordial spectrum and @xmath35 is the sum of the active neutrino masses .",
    "next , we explore non - standard neutrino scenarios in which the effective number of thermalized species is parameterized by @xmath2 . as commonly assumed in the literature , we start here assuming a massless neutrino scenario with @xmath2 massless species .",
    "one of the main effects of @xmath2 on the cmb temperature anisotropies arises from the change of the epoch of the radiation matter equality , shifting therefore the location of the cmb acoustic peaks .",
    "this position is given by the so - called acoustic scale @xmath36 , which reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the comoving angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface and the sound horizon at the recombination epoch @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "although @xmath38 almost remains the same for different values of @xmath2 , @xmath39 becomes smaller when @xmath2 is increased .",
    "therefore , the positions of acoustic peaks are shifted to higher multipoles ( smaller angular scales ) if the value of @xmath2 is increased .",
    "however , this effect can be compensated by changing the cold dark matter density , in such a way that @xmath40 remains fixed , see ref .",
    "@xcite . therefore , due to the degeneracy with the cold dark matter component , the change induced at low @xmath41 is negligible and the largest impact of @xmath2 on the cmb temperature anisotropies comes from its effect on high multipoles @xmath41 , since a higher value of @xmath2 will induce a drop in power at small scales due to an increased silk damping .",
    "silk damping refers to the suppression in power of the cmb temperature anisotropies on scales smaller than the photon diffusion length . as a random walk process ,",
    "the diffusion distance @xmath42 will increase as the square root of time and therefore a higher expansion rate @xmath43 ( caused by a higher @xmath2 ) will _ decrease _ @xmath42 , decreasing therefore the damping .",
    "however , in order to keep the acoustic scale @xmath36 fixed , the comoving angular @xmath38 distance at decoupling should scale in the same way as @xmath39 does ( i.e.  as @xmath44 ) and the angular scale of the silk damping @xmath45 will grow as @xmath46 . consequently , the damping will be _ increased _ when @xmath2 does due to the higher expansion rate @xmath43 , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this first non - standard scenario is described by the following set of parameters :    @xmath47 , { n_{\\textrm{eff}}}\\}~.\\ ] ]    however , we know from neutrino oscillation experiments that neutrino have non - zero masses and mixings .",
    "in fact , a recent neutrino oscillation analysis has shown that models with three active plus two sterile light ( sub - ev ) neutrino species provide a very good fit to short baseline data  @xcite .",
    "therefore the previous minimal non - standard scenario with @xmath2 massless neutrinos should be enlarged to accommodate active plus sterile neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "the last scenario explored here therefore consists of @xmath2 massive neutrino species , each with equal mass @xmath48 .",
    "the effects of these two parameters on the observables have been summarized above .",
    "while the highest sensitivity to the neutrino masses comes from large scale structure information , and the highest @xmath2 sensitivity comes from cmb measurements , there will be significant covariance between the two parameters and we explore this degeneracy in [ subsubsec : b ] . in this last non - standard scenario ,",
    "the set of parameters involved in the study are    @xmath49 , { n_{\\textrm{eff } } } , \\sum m_\\nu\\}~.\\ ] ]    for our numerical analyses , we have used the boltzmann camb code  @xcite and extracted cosmological parameters from current data using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) analysis based on the publicly available mcmc package ` cosmomc `  @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : priors ] specifies the priors considered on the different cosmological parameters  .",
    "our neutrino mass prior is cast in the form of a ( uniform ) prior on the neutrino density fraction @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the ratio of the neutrino energy density over the critical density at redshift zero , and @xmath52 is the same ratio , but for the total dark matter density , which includes cold dark matter and neutrinos .    we restrict ourselves to a @xmath8cdm cosmology in the different scenarios described above .",
    ".uniform priors for the cosmological parameters considered here .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have presented constraints on several neutrino - extra radiation scenarios with the most recent and available cosmological data .",
    "the data sets explored here include the recent measurement of the bao feature in the dr9 cmass sample of the boss experiment .",
    "three scenarios have been carefully examined : one standard scenario with three massive neutrino species , and two non - standard scenarios with @xmath2 massless / massive neutrino species . in each scenario",
    "we have carefully explored the different existing degeneracies and the impact of the different data sets exploited here , both separately and combined . in the standard scenario where only three active neutrinos are considered , the combination of cmb wmap plus hst data helps enormously in breaking the strong degeneracy between @xmath20 and the hubble parameter @xmath53 that exists with cmb data only , and the addition of further cosmological data sets does not improve significantly the limit on @xmath20 . in this standard scenario ,",
    "wmap data plus geometrical information from bao signals gives similar results to those obtained from wmap data plus the measurements of the full shape of the matter power spectrum .    in the non - standard scenario with @xmath2 massless neutrinos ,",
    "the combination of wmap and hst data is also able to break the strong degeneracies between the effective number of neutrino species and other cosmological parameters , such as the hubble parameter and the physical dark matter energy density .",
    "spt high multipole cmb data is also extremely useful in constraining the effective number of neutrino species , due to the increase in the silk damping effect at small scales induced in the case of @xmath4 .",
    "the addition of sdss - ii galaxy clustering data or recent bao measurements does not improve the constraints on @xmath2 in the massless neutrino scenario .",
    "we obtain @xmath3 when combining the former bao data set with cmb and hst measurements .",
    "therefore , the cosmological evidence for @xmath4 claimed often in the literature gets still remains when considering these new data sets , and the value of @xmath2 very close to the standard model expectations ( @xmath54 ) , being the discrepancy at the @xmath5 level .    in the most general non - standard scenario explored here , the strong degeneracy existing among the two neutrino parameters @xmath20 and @xmath2 makes mandatory the combination of several data sets .",
    "the constraints from the combination of wmap and hst measurements become one order of magnitude weaker than in the previous two scenarios ( @xmath2 fixed or @xmath48 fixed ) , although if more data sets are added in the analysis , the situation improves significantly .",
    "given that we know the sum of neutrino masses is non - zero , this means that constraining the number of neutrino species while neglecting the sum of their masses could lead to completely wrong results , and thus in general caution is advised .",
    "in the reverse scenario , i.e.  constraining @xmath48 while keeping @xmath18 fixed , the same danger exists , but the major difference is that @xmath2 may well be equal to its standard model value , while we know @xmath55 is non - zero .    to summarize the result with our maximal combination of data sets , the joint constraints on the effective number of massive neutrino species and on the sum of their masses from cmb , supernovae and the new bao data are @xmath56 and @xmath57  ev , respectively ( both at the 95% cl ) . near future cosmological data , as cmb measurements from the planck mission , combined with other probes ,",
    "are expected to settle the issue of whether there exists cosmological compelling evidence for extra radiation .",

    "<S> our cosmological data sets include the measurement of the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) feature in the data release 9 cmass sample of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) . </S>",
    "<S> we study in detail the different degeneracies among the parameters , as well as the impact of the different data sets used in the analyses . </S>",
    "<S> when considering bounds on the sum of the three active neutrino masses , the information in the bao signal from galaxy clustering measurements is approximately equally powerful as the shape information from the matter power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the most stringent bound we find is @xmath0  ev at 95@xmath1 cl . </S>",
    "<S> when non - standard neutrino scenarios with @xmath2 massless or massive neutrino species are examined , power spectrum shape measurements provide slightly better bounds than the bao signal only , due to the breaking of parameter degeneracies .    </S>",
    "<S> cosmic microwave background data from high multipoles from the south pole telescope turns out to be crucial for extracting the number of effective neutrino species . </S>",
    "<S> recent boss data combined with cmb and hubble space telescope measurements give @xmath3 in the massless neutrino scenario , and similar results are obtained in the massive case . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence for extra radiation @xmath4 often claimed in the literature therefore remains at the @xmath5 level when considering up - to - date cosmological data sets . </S>",
    "<S> measurements from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe combined with a prior on the hubble parameter from the hubble space telescope are very powerful in constraining either the sum of the three active neutrino masses or the number of massless neutrino species . </S>",
    "<S> if the former two parameters are allowed to freely vary , however , the bounds from the combination of these two cosmological probes get worse by an order of magnitude . </S>"
