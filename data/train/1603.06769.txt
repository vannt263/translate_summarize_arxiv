    "one of the oldest ideas that unify gravity and electromagnetism is the theory of kaluza and klein which extends space - time to five dimensions .",
    "the physical motivation for this unification is that the vacuum solutions of the @xmath0 kaluza - klein field equations reduce to the @xmath1 einstein field equations with effective matter and the curvature in @xmath0 space induces matter in @xmath1 dimensional space - time@xcite . with this idea ,",
    "the four dimensional energy - momentum tensor is derived from the geometry of an exact five dimensional vacuum solution , and the properties of matter such as density and pressure as well as electromagnetic properties are determined by such a solution . in other words ,",
    "the field equations of both electromagnetism and gravity can be obtained from the pure five - dimensional geometry .",
    "kaluzas idea was that the universe has four spatial dimensions , and the extra dimension is compactified to form a circle so small as to be unobservable .",
    "klein s contribution was to make a reasonable physical basis for the compactification of the fifth dimension .",
    "this school of thinking later led to the eleven - dimensional supergravity theories in 1980s and to the theory of everything or ten - dimensional superstrings .    in this paper , we present a vacuum solution of kaluza - klein theory in five - dimensional spacetime which is closely related to the taub - nut metric .",
    "the taub - nut solution has many interesting features ; it carries a new type of charge ( nut charge ) , which has topological origins and can be regarded as gravitational magnetic charge , so the solution is known in some other contexts as the kaluza - klein magnetic monopole @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section @xmath2",
    ", we briefly discuss the formalism of five dimensional kaluza - klein theory and the effective four - dimensional einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "we will then present a taub - nut - like kaluza - klien solution and investigate its physical properties in four dimensions in section 3 . in the last section we will draw our main conclusions .",
    "kaluza @xmath3 and klein @xmath4 , used one extra dimension to unify gravity and electromagnetism in a theory which was basically five - dimensional general relativity .",
    "the theoretical elegance of this idea is revealed by studying the vacuum solutions of kaluza - klein equations and the matter induced in the four - dimensional spacetime @xcite.thus , we are chiefly interested in the vacuum five dimensional einstein equations . for any vacuum solution , the energy - momentum tensor vanishes and thus @xmath5 or , equivalently @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the einstein tensor , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the five - dimensional ricci tensor and scalar , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is the metric tensor in five dimensions . here , the indices @xmath11 run over @xmath12 .",
    "generally , one can identify the @xmath13 part of @xmath14 with @xmath15 , which is the contravariant four dimensional metric tensor , @xmath16 with the electromagnetic potential and @xmath17 as a scalar field .",
    "the correspondence between the above components is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a coupling constant for the electromagnetic potential @xmath20 and the indices @xmath21 run over @xmath22 .",
    "the five dimensional field equations reduce to the four dimensional field equations@xcite @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the einstein tensor , @xmath26 is the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor and the field strength @xmath27 .",
    "knowing the five dimensional metric , therefore , leads to a complete knowledge of the four dimensional geometry , as well as the electromagnetic and scalar fields .",
    "the taub - nut solution was first discovered by taub ( 1951 ) , and subsequently by newman , tamburino and unti ( 1963 ) as a generalization of the schwarzschild spacetime @xcite .",
    "the kaluza - klein monopole of gross and perry is described by the following metric which is a generalization of the self - dual euclidean taub - nut solution @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 this solution has a coordinate singularity at @xmath30 which is called nut singularity .",
    "this can be absent if the coordinate @xmath31 is periodic with period @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the radius of the fifth dimension .",
    "gross and perry showed that the kaluza - klein theory can contain magnetic monopole solitons which would support the unified gauge theories and allow us for searching the physics of unification .    here",
    ", we introduce a metric which is a vacuum five dimensional solution , having some properties in common with the monopole of gross and perry , while some other properties being different .",
    "the proposed static metric is given by @xmath34 here , the extra coordinate is represented by @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath37 are constants and @xmath38 is an arbitrary function of the radial coordinate @xmath39 .",
    "the coordinates take on the usual values with range @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the ricci scalar associated with the five dimensional metric ( [ 6 ] ) is given by @xmath44,\\ ] ] since we are interested in vacuum solution where the ricci tensor is zero @xmath45 it is necessary but not sufficient to have a zero ricci scalar @xmath46 which can be solved for the function @xmath38 to give @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are constants . by substituting the function @xmath38 in the ricci scalar in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) and for having a zero ricci scalar one can obtain the following constraint between the constants @xmath51 or @xmath52 thus the ricci scalar in terms of the above constants reduces to @xmath53 in order to have a zero ricci scalar the two following possibilities can be obtained for the constants @xmath54 as it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) with @xmath55 the ricci tensor is not zero and does not give a vacuum solution , thus this case is discarded .",
    "however , the second choice @xmath56 gives a ricci flat solution with a non - zero riemann tensor in five dimensions which is our interest .",
    "consequently , the general form of the function @xmath38 would be given by @xmath57 in what follows , we take the constants @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the metric in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) reduces to ( we choose the minus sign for @xmath38 ) @xmath61    the gauge field , @xmath16 and the scalar field @xmath17 deduced from the metric in eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) are @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "the only non - vanishing component for the electromagnetic tensor which is related to the gauge field @xmath64 by the general statement @xmath65 is @xmath66 which corresponds to a radial magnetic field @xmath67 with a magnetic monopole charge @xmath68 .",
    "as the radial coordinate @xmath39 goes to infinity @xmath69 , the scalar field equals @xmath70 so that the second part of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) becomes zero , therefore @xmath71 where we have put the speed of light @xmath72 equal to @xmath73 . by comparing this equation with the ordinary einstein equation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath74 , thus the constant @xmath19 equals @xmath75 .",
    "straightforwardly , the total magnetic monopole charge is given by @xmath76 the total magnetic flux through any spherical surface centered at the origin is calculated as@xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the electromagnetic field tensor as mentioned earlier and @xmath79 is interpreted as an element of two - dimensional surface area .",
    "it is investigated from eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) that the flux of the magnetic monopole is constant ( i.e. we have a singular magnetic charge ) .",
    "the four dimensional metric deduced from eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) with the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) leads to the following asymptotically flat spacetime : @xmath80 for this metric , the ricci scalar and the kretschmann invariant @xmath81 are given by @xmath82 and @xmath83,\\ ] ] it is seen that the four dimensional metric eq .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) has two curvature singularities at @xmath30 and @xmath84 .",
    "let us calculate the surface area of a @xmath85 hypersurface at constant @xmath86 and @xmath39 to clarify the nature of the @xmath84 singularity @xmath87 it can be seen that the surface area @xmath88 becomes zero at @xmath84 .",
    "this means that @xmath84 hypersurface is not an event horizon but is just the origin . for the case",
    "@xmath89 the signature of the metric is proper @xmath90 but for the range @xmath91 the signature of the metric will be improper and non - lorentzian @xmath92 , thus the patch @xmath91 is excluded from the spacetime . from now on ,",
    "this spacetime is only considered in the range @xmath93 . since the range @xmath94 is omitted from the spacetime ,",
    "there is only one curvature singularity at @xmath84 .",
    "the metric ( [ 26 ] ) can be transformed into the following form , using the radial coordinate transformation @xmath95 ; @xmath96 while the metric ( [ 26 ] ) is singular at @xmath30 and @xmath84 , the transformed metric is singular only at @xmath97 which is a curvature singularity .",
    "the properties of the induced matter associated with the above metric can be gained by the eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the components of the energy - momentum tensor can be easily calculated for the metric ( [ 26 ] ) .",
    "we find that the effective source is like a fluid with an anisotropic pressure . at sufficiently large @xmath39",
    ", the energy - momentum components will tend to zero .",
    "the trace of the energy - momentum tensor does not vanish generally , which shows that the effective matter field around the singularity can not be considered as an ultra - relativistic quantum field in contrast to the kaluza - klein solitons described in ref .",
    "although it is apparent from the @xmath98 component of the @xmath99 metric ( [ 26 ] ) that the gravitational mass corresponding to this solutions vanishes , it could also be confirmed by calculating the following integrals : @xmath100 and @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the determinant of the 3-metric .",
    "inspired by the taub - nut solution , we introduced a kaluza - klein vacuum solution in @xmath103 , which described a magnetic monopole in @xmath1d spacetime .",
    "the gravitational mass of the solution was shown to vanish .",
    "the fluid supporting the four dimensional space - time was shown to differ from that of an ultra - relativistic fluid , in contrast with the work by wesson and leon @xcite .",
    "the pressure is anisotropic in both works .",
