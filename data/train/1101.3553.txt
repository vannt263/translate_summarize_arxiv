    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm has been remarkably successful at predicting the large - scale distribution of matter in the universe as well as its observed evolution from the earliest epochs to the present day @xcite . however , much interest has been shown in possible discrepancies that remain on small scales between its predictions and the available observations . a source of continuing puzzlement relates to the observed form of the dark matter ( dm ) profile seen in galaxy clusters .",
    "numerical simulations predict cdm halos follow a self - similar density profile whose three - dimensional ( 3d ) form within a scale radius @xmath4 approaches a cusp @xmath5 with an inner slope @xmath6 at the smallest resolved scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "improved resolution has suggested modest flattening @xcite , but only at very small radii .",

    "@xmath8 has been inferred in abell  1703 @xcite , possibly indicating significant scatter in the inner structure of clusters .    recently in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n09 ) we further developed the method introduced by @xcite by incorporating weak lensing constraints on the large - scale mass distribution using _ subaru _ imaging of abell 611 .",
    "this removed a degeneracy between the scale radius @xmath4 and @xmath1 and led to the first measurement of the dm profile across a dynamic range in cluster - centric radius ( 3  kpc to 3.3  mpc ) comparable to that presently achieved in simulations .",
    "a shallow cusp with @xmath9 ( 68% ) was derived .    here",
    "we make two further improvements in our methodology and apply these to abell 383 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this cluster has a regular optical and x - ray morphology , a remarkably low sub - structure fraction , and a dominant , near - circular brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite initially studied this cluster assuming spherical symmetry but later @xcite undertook a two - dimensional ( 2d ) lensing analysis , deriving @xmath11 .",
    "in addition to removing the scale radius degeneracy discussed above , we have considerably extended the range of the stellar kinematic constraints via a deep keck spectrum of the bcg , significantly improving our knowledge of the mass distribution on @xmath12  kpc scales .",
    "secondly , we use _ chandra _ x - ray data to determine the line - of - sight ellipticity in the mass distribution , thereby achieving constraints on a 3d model with minimal uncertainties arising from projection effects .",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 throughout .",
    "we first discuss in turn the four observational ingredients we use to constrain the distribution of dark matter and baryons in abell 383 .",
    "figure  [ fig : strong ] shows the multiply - imaged sources , tabulated in @xcite and @xcite , which comprise the strong lensing constraints : a radial / tangential arc at @xmath16 and a complex system in the southwest . in previous analyses the redshift of the latter system was unknown , but",
    "following keck / lris observations in october  2009 we secured a spectroscopic redshift @xmath17 for images 3c and 4c .",
    "the @xmath18=12 images of @xmath19=4 sources produces @xmath20 constraints . following n09 ,",
    "we use lenstool @xcite in source plane mode for the strong lensing analysis .",
    "consistent with earlier work , we adopt an uncertainty of @xmath21 for the image positions to account for systematic modelling uncertainty .      the large - scale shear arising from abell 383 has been analyzed with multi - color imaging taken using suprimecam at the _ subaru _ telescope .",
    "the shear was measured in @xmath22 images taken by the authors on 12 - 13 november 2007 in excellent seeing of @xmath23 .",
    "broad - band photometry from @xmath24 images in the _ subaru _ archive was used with the bpz code @xcite to obtain photometric redshifts .",
    "the procedures closely followed those discussed by n09 . from a sample of galaxies with @xmath25 detections in @xmath22 ,",
    "a population with @xmath26 was selected for shear measurement , yielding a surface density of 25  arcmin@xmath27 . as discussed in n09",
    ", our shear measurements were calibrated using the recovery factor @xmath28 based on the step2 simulations @xcite .",
    "we have substantially improved the data used by @xcite by securing a much deeper spectroscopic exposure of the bcg ( figure  [ fig : dynamics ] ) .",
    "earlier data yielded a stellar velocity dispersion profile @xmath29 extending to @xmath30  kpc in 3 spatial bins ( figure  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "the present data comprise a 22.8  ks integration with keck / lris taken on 12 october 2009 using the 600 mm@xmath31 blue grism and the 600 mm@xmath31 red grating blazed at 7500   .",
    "the @xmath32 slit yielded a resolution of @xmath33   km  s@xmath34 at the g band .",
    "the improved depth of this exposure has enabled us to secure a reliable dispersion profile to 26 kpc ( circularized ) , which can be verified independently using both the g band and fe absorption lines ( figure  [ fig : dynamics ] ) .",
    "spectra of g and k giants from the miles library @xcite were used to synthesize the optimal stellar template ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the gain over earlier data is substantial both in extent and sampling .",
    "although @xmath29 has been measured to very large radii in local cd galaxies @xcite , this is to our knowledge the most extended measurement yet obtained in a lensing cluster .",
    "the final ingredient is the mass distribution probed by x - ray emission from the intracluster medium .",
    "this was measured by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter a08 ) using _ chandra _ data .",
    "although their analysis assumed spherical symmetry , this has very little effect on the inferred _ spherically - averaged _ mass profile , as we discuss further in section  [ sec : systematics ] .",
    "mock observations of simulated clusters show that non - thermal sources of pressure cause x - ray  derived masses to be biased by @xmath35 @xcite . to account for this",
    ", we place a gaussian prior on @xmath36 , where @xmath37 represents the a08 results and @xmath38 the true spherically - averaged mass distribution .",
    "the 10% uncertainty in @xmath39 reflects the cluster - to - cluster scatter in non - thermal support , as well as uncertainty in the _ chandra _ temperature calibration @xcite . from the a08 mass profile",
    ", we take five points spaced log - uniformly from @xmath40  kpc to match the number of independent temperature measurements .",
    "( the results are not sensitive to the inner limit . ) finally , we add 10% in quadrature to the uncertainty in each data point to allow for systematic errors with radial gradients ( e.g. , non - thermal pressure and errors arising from non - sphericity ) .",
    "our model of the cluster mass distribution comprises three components : ( 1 ) the cluster - scale halo , ( 2 ) stellar mass in the bcg , and ( 3 ) mass in other cluster galaxies which are incorporated as perturbations in the lensing analysis .",
    "the third component is modelled as described in our previous work , including two individually - modelled galaxies ( p1 and p2 in figure  [ fig : strong ] ) .",
    "following n09 , the cluster halo and bcg are described by generalized nfw ( gnfw ) and dual pseudoisothermal ellipsoid ( dpie ) profiles , with a key improvement : the newly - incorporated x - ray data allows us to consider triaxial mass models .    by combining x - ray and lensing constraints",
    ", we can directly measure the elongation of the dm distribution along the line of sight ( l.o.s ) , thus addressing a key systematic uncertainty in deriving the mass density profile .",
    "whereas lensing probes the projected mass contained in cylinders ( 2d ) , the x - ray data is sensitive to the spherically - averaged ( 3d ) enclosed masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the combination thus provides information on the l.o.s .  geometry . since the surface density of abell 383 and the bcg isophotes are both nearly circular",
    "( @xmath41 ) , any large departure from sphericity must be along the l.o.s .    in detail",
    ", we adopt a triaxial gnfw form for the dm halo : @xmath42 where @xmath43 here the @xmath0-axis is the l.o.s . ; the factor @xmath44 in equation [ eqn : gnfw ] therefore ensures that the surface density is constant as @xmath45 varies .",
    "the ellipticity of the mass surface density @xmath46 is related to that of the lensing potential @xmath47 following @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath48 and @xmath49 correspond to prolate and oblate cases , respectively .",
    "following n09 , the stellar mass of the bcg is modelled by a dpie profile @xcite fit to _ hst _ surface photometry .",
    "however , we consider a more general triaxial deprojection , with @xmath50 defined as in equation [ eqn : reps ] , replacing @xmath46 and @xmath45 by @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .    before describing our detailed analysis ,",
    "it is useful to gain some physical insight into the effects of varying @xmath45 and @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath45 governs the ratio between 2d and 3d halo masses and is therefore well - constrained by the combination of lensing and x - ray data . in contrast , @xmath53 is not constrained by long - slit kinematic data , and we therefore adopt a prior distribution based on knowledge of the intrinsic axis ratios of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "we can expect that @xmath54 ( in the prolate notation ) , both because simulated dm halos are much more flattened ( @xmath55 , @xcite ) than stars in elliptical galaxies ( @xmath56 , @xcite ) , and because isotropic dissipation processes in the baryon - dominated regime should yield rounder mass distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "qualitatively , we expect that for a fixed halo , rounder stellar orbits will enclose less mass , thereby reducing the observed stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "this introduces a degeneracy between @xmath52 and @xmath1 . by accounting for this degeneracy , we incorporate uncertainties arising from triaxiality and projection into our final results .    technically , models are compared to the x - ray data by computing spherically - enclosed masses in a triaxial mass distribution , as justified in sections  [ sec : xray ] and [ sec : systematics ] .",
    "fully triaxial dynamical models are not computationally feasible . however , since the observations imply dm axis ratios of @xmath57 , a spheroidal treatment with the symmetry axis along the l.o.s",
    ".  is a very good approximation .",
    "this represents a significant improvement over our previous spherical dynamical models . by assuming a two - integral distribution function @xmath58 ,",
    "the dynamics can be computed as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "table 1 summarizes the model parameters and our assumed priors .",
    "as detailed in n09 , models are proposed by markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) , and their likelihood is computed as the product of the likelihoods of the four datasets .",
    "our model fits are plotted in figure  [ fig : massprofile ] and summarized in table  1 . to reconcile the observed velocity dispersions with the lensing and x - ray data ,",
    "shallow dm slopes are preferred .",
    "as expected , the formal uncertainties are increased with respect to previous models that neglected triaxiality @xcite , yet we still obtain @xmath59 ( 68% confidence , @xmath60 at 95% ) .",
    "interestingly , the dm halo is found to be elongated along the l.o.s .",
    ", with @xmath61 , typical of simulated halos @xcite and consistent with the orientation selection bias expected for strong lenses .",
    "furthermore , the stellar mass - to - light ratio is found to be in agreement with the values inferred from stellar population synthesis models , assuming a salpeter imf ( treu et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the parameter degeneracies are illustrated in figure  [ fig : degen ] .",
    "it is instructive to see how they have been minimized by the combination of observational tools unique to our method . by including only lensing constraints , for example",
    ", we would obtain weaker constraints on @xmath1 due to the unconstrained stellar mass .",
    "the degeneracy with @xmath4 is reduced using weak lensing and x - ray probes at large radii .",
    "finally , the dm l.o.s .",
    "ellipticity @xmath45 is determined by the combination of x - ray and lensing data .",
    "equally important to the inferred model parameters is the `` goodness of fit . ''",
    "as figure  [ fig : massprofile ] clearly shows , a relatively simple model , with a single dm halo characterized by a simple functional form , fits all the data remarkably well , including the extended velocity dispersion data and the detailed strong lensing features .",
    "( the best - fitting models have image plane rms errors of @xmath62 . )",
    "the velocity dispersion profile is particularly encouraging : its shape and normalization are well - matched , which was typically challenging using spherical dynamical models ( * ? ?",
    "in this letter we have incorporated additional data and more sophisticated models to address the impact of projection . here",
    "we consider the residual systematic uncertainties .",
    "first , we repeated the analysis with all @xmath63 measurements shifted by 10% to account for systematic measurement uncertainties .",
    "we note that the mild radial orbital anisotropy typically observed at lower redshift can only decrease @xmath1 ( see n09 ) .",
    "second , we assumed that the bcg is coincident with the center of the dm halo , consistent with the @xmath64  kpc projected offset required by the lensing .",
    "a similar 3d offset has little effect on the enclosed mass outside @xmath65  kpc , so we can evaluate the effects of this assumption by excluding data within 6  kpc .",
    "a spatially - constant @xmath66 was assumed , consistent with our non - detection of a color gradient outside the central @xmath67 .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate limits on @xmath68 from those on @xmath69 .",
    "we translate this to an uncertainty on @xmath70 and repeat the analysis shifting @xmath70 .    finally , we recall that the a08 x - ray measurements assumed sphericity , whereas our mass models are non - spherical . by calculating the gas emission in a non - spherical halo with @xmath71 , we estimate that spherically deprojecting the x - ray observables biases the inferred ( spherically - averaged ) mass profile by only @xmath72 typically , consistent with previous studies @xcite . as discussed in section  [ sec : xray ] , this small bias is comparable to other systematic uncertainties inherent to x - ray analyses and is within our adopted calibration uncertainty .",
    "we estimate the impact on our results by shifting the x - ray masses accordingly .    in all cases , the limits on @xmath1 shifted by @xmath73 . we conclude that the remaining known systematic uncertainties are much smaller than the projection uncertainty addressed in this letter .",

    "cosmological hydrodynamical simulations incorporating baryonic physics ( cooling and feedback ) with high resolution find that baryon condensation in the cluster core steepens the dm slope ( an effect termed `` adiabatic contraction '' ) , thereby increasing @xmath1 and worsening the discrepancy with observations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xmath108 ; @xcite , @xmath109 ; @xcite , @xmath110 ) .",
