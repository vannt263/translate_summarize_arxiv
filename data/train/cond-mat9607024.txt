    "the problem how to determine correct energetics is paramount to the complete solution of the protein folding problem .",
    "two avenues to determine energy functions ( force - fields ) for proteins have been pursued .",
    "first , is more or less rigorous or semi - empirical classical or quantum mechanical calculations to determine , from the first principles , and/or fitting to spectroscopic experimental data , the forces acting between aminoacids in vacuum or in solution ( vasques _ et al _ , 1994 ) .",
    "this approach is rigorous but it encounters formidable computational difficulties .",
    "most importantly , it can be realized only within the framework of detailed , atomistic description of aminoacids",
    ". however , detailed atom resolution models of proteins are not feasible for folding simulations due to obvious computational difficulties .",
    "an alternative , more practical , approach is to introduce simplified , coarse - grained models of proteins where aminoacids are represented in a simplified way , as one or few interacting centers which may have some internal degrees of freedom as well but which are generally much simpler than real aminoacids ( levitt , 1976 ; ueda _ et al _ , 1978 ; miyazawa and jernigan , 1985 ; wilson and doniach , 1989 ; skolnick and kolinsky 1990 ; shakhnovich _ et al_. 1991 ) .",
    "such models are more tractable computationally both in threading approaches ( finkelstein and reva , 1991 ; jones _ et al _ , 1992 ) and and",
    "_ ab initio _ simulations ( kolinsky and skolnick , 1993 , 1994 ) .",
    "however , the serious problem with simplified representation of proteins , is how to describe protein energetics at the coarse grained level of structure description . in particular , what `` force - fields '' should act between these simplified interacting centers , which are still identified with natural aminoacids , such that native structures , for these model proteins , still correspond to pronounced energy minima for their respective sequences ?",
    "an approach to address this problem was proposed by tanaka and scheraga ( 1976 ) and was developed in the seminal contribution of miyazawa and jernigan ( mj ) ( 1985 ) .",
    "the mj method is based on statistical analysis of protein structures and determination of frequencies of contacts , defined in the realm of simplified protein representation , e.g. , as two @xmath1 atoms being closer to each other than specified cutoff distance .",
    "frequencies of individual aminoacid contacts were derived and compared with what one should expect at random mixing , and interaction with solvent was accounted for as well .",
    "then quasichemical approximation was employed which related these properly normalized frequencies with `` potentials '' via the relation : @xmath2 where i and j denote aminoacid types ; @xmath3 are normalized frequencies of contacts between them determined from the database of existing structures .",
    "the definition of energy scale denoted as `` temperature '' t in the quasichemical approximation of mj is a delicate problem .",
    "it was addressed in a recent work by finkelstein _ et al _ ( 1993,1996 ) who also showed that quasichemical approximation may be a reasonable one under the assumption that protein sequences are random . in",
    "the recent work mirny and domany ( 1996 ) showed that quasichemical approximation is also valid if conatct energies are independent and unformly disributed .",
    "the subsequent development of the knowledge - based approach based on quasichemical approximation included efforts to incorporate distance - dependent forces sippl ( 1990 ) , better representation of aminoacid geometry and approximation od multible - body interactions ( kolinsky and skolnick , 1993,1994 ) , dihedral angles ( kolaskarand and prashanth , 1979 ; nishikawa and matsuo , 1993 ; rooman _ et al _ , 1992 ; dewitte and shakhnovich , 1994 ) , better treatment of solvent - protein interactions ( levitt and hinds , 1995 ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of features of knowledge - based potentials and examples of their successful and unsuccessful application is given by kocher _",
    "et al _ ( 1994 ) ; the approaches to derive potentials from quasichemical approximation , especially the most difficult issue of reference state are discussed by ( godzik _ et al _ , 1995 ) .",
    "real potential is believed to discriminate the native structure by making its energy much lower than energy of all other conformations , i.e. it provides stability of the native structure .",
    "protein sequences should also fold fast to their respective native conformations .",
    "it was shown , for simple models of proteins , that these two conditions - thermodynamic stability and kinetic accessibility - are met when the native state is a _ pronounced _ energy minimum for the native sequence , compared to the set of misfolded conformations ( sali _ et al _ , 1994 ; shakhnovich , 1994 ; gutin _ et al _ , 1995 ) .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to suggest that the essential property of the correct , `` true '' , folding potential , is that the energy of a native sequence folded into its respective native conformation should be much lower than the energy of this sequence in all alternative conformations .",
    "an approach to derivation of protein folding potentials which takes this requirement explicitly into account was proposed by goldstein _",
    "et al _ ( 1992 ) ( gsw ) and by maiorov and crippen ( 1992 ) .",
    "et al _ maximized the quantity @xmath4 , equivalent to maximization of the energy gap between the native state and bulk of decoys .",
    "they showed that for each individual protein the problem of potential optimization has a simple analytical solution ; however their approach encountered a serious problem of how to average over different structures in the database .",
    "indeed , a potential optimized for one protein is not necessarily ( an in fact never ! ) optimal for another protein , while the goal is to find a potential which is good , or optimal , simultaneously for many proteins .",
    "gsw found an _",
    "ad hoc _ procedure of averaging over protein database which gave best results in their tests .    in this work",
    "we suggest a systematic method to find a potential which delivers pronounced energy minimum to _ all _ proteins in their native conformations and hence should provide fast folding and stability of model proteins .",
    "the method is general and is not limited to any form of potential or any model of a protein .",
    "another important feature of this approach is that it has internal criterion of self - consistency : when the derived potential does not change significantly upon addition of new proteins to database it corresponds to meaningful , nontrivial energetics .",
    "the proposed new method of potential derivation should be tested and compared with existing approaches .",
    "how can it be done ?",
    "the serious problem with testing parameters derived by any approach is the lack of objective rigorous criterion of success because `` true '' potentials are not known ( and they are not likely to exist at all since real proteins differ from their simplified representation ) .",
    "a reasonable criterion can be that the derived potentials are useful for fold recognition and _ ab initio _ folding .",
    "the results of numerous tests by many groups ( see the comprehensive analysis in the special issue of proteins , ( lattman , 1995 ) ) show that while existing knowledge - based potentials often do a decent job in fold recognition , they are not sufficiently accurate for _ ab initio _ folding .",
    "a strong evidence that the `` bottleneck '' in _ ab initio _ folding is in the energy function rather than in search strategy is that _ ab initio _ procedures fail because decoys with energy , lower than energy of expected native conformations are found in test cases ( covell , 1994 ; elofson , 1995 ) , while in inverse folding tests the native structure is in most cases ( though not always ) has lower energy than decoys ( wodak and rooman , 1993 , lemer _ et al _ , 1995 ; miyazawa and jernigan , 1996 ) .    the best way to assess different procedures of derivation of potentials is to use , as a test case , a model system where the correct form of the hamiltonian ( say , pairwise contact potential ) is given , and the `` true '' potential is known .",
    "different procedures to extract potentials can be applied , and then the `` true '' and derived potentials can be compared .",
    "further , the derived potentials can be used , in a model system , for threading or _",
    "ab initio _ folding to compare its performance with such of `` true '' potentials and thus to close the circle .",
    "such a comprehensive analysis is possible in the realm of lattice models .",
    "the step in this direction was made by thomas and dill ( 1996 ) ; these authors considered 2-dimensional short lattice chains composed of monomers of two types .",
    "in this paper we test our procedure of derivation of potentials as well as other approaches using 3-dimensional lattice model proteins composed of `` aminoacids '' of 20 types .",
    "sequence design algorithm has been developed recently which generates sequences which have specified relative energy ( z - score , bowie _ et al _ , 1991 ) in a given conformation shakhnovich and gutin , 1993a , b ; abkevich _ et al _ , 1995a ) . .",
    "this allows us to carry out the following rigorous procedure of testing our and alternative approaches to derive parameters :    \\a ) select at random a number of lattice conformations to serve as native ones .",
    "\\b ) using some potential ( `` true '' potential for the model ) , design sequences to have selected conformations as native ones , thus creating a model `` protein data bank '' .",
    "\\c ) using different procedures extract `` knowledge - based potentials ''    \\d ) compare derived potentials with the `` true '' one .",
    "test the performance of the derived potentials in _ ab initio _ folding simulations and threading , using the database of model proteins which has not been used for the derivation of potentials .",
    "this approach to test the potentials allows to address , in a systematic way , and for different procedures of parameter derivation , an important issue of what database size is sufficient to successfully derive parameters .",
    "further , we can create `` databanks '' of model proteins of different stability .",
    "it makes it possible to address the issue of how well optimized protein sequences should be to allow successful derivation of parameters .",
    "the program described in a - d ( except _ ab initio _ folding tests ) can be straightforwardly carried out not only for lattice model proteins but for real proteins .",
    "indeed , with any set of parameters , we can design sequences for protein conformations , and evaluate the `` ideal '' value of z - score for a given model hamiltonian . this is to be compared with scores for native sequences with the same parameters .",
    "the comparison will shed light not only on advantages and pitfalls of parameter derivation procedure but also on the most important issue of what models are better for prediction of protein conformations .    in subsequent chapters of this paper we will carry out this program .",
    "energy function assigns the value of the energy to a given conformation for a given amino acid sequence . @xmath5    where * u * is the set of parameters of potential to be derived from known native structures of proteins .",
    "we use @xmath6 score as a measure of how pronounced is the energy minimum corresponding to the native conformations ( with respect to a set of alternative conformations ) ( bowie _ et al _ , 1991 ) :    @xmath7    which is the deviation of the energy of the native conformation from average energy of alternative conformations measured in units of standard deviation .",
    "average energy @xmath8 and variance @xmath9 are computed over a set of alternative conformations ( see below ) .",
    "absolute value of @xmath6 score is the natural measure of the energy gap .",
    "our goal is to find a potential * u * which minimizes @xmath6 scores ( maximizes the energy gap ) simultaneously for all proteins in the dataset .",
    "this is achieved by building a target function , which is an appropriate combination of individual @xmath6 scores and then optimizing this function with respect to * u*. one should be careful about choosing a combination of @xmath6 scores to optimize .",
    "if the target function to be optimized is chosen naively , for example sum of @xmath6 scores , then low values of the target function can be obtained if @xmath6 is small enough for some proteins and large for all others . to avoid this kind of a problem one has to minimize @xmath10 , which is however , very difficult to deal with because of its discontinuity .",
    "we chose harmonic mean of @xmath11 scores as a function to be minimized .",
    "@xmath12    in fact , harmonic mean is a smooth approximation of @xmath13 since terms with the smallest absolute value of @xmath11 scores contribute most to the harmonic mean .    to maximize the energy gap for all proteins in a dataset we search for a potential * u * which maximizes the value of function @xmath14 .",
    "the value @xmath15 is directly related to the energy gap so in future we will ( somewhat semantically frivolously ) refer to as energy gap , understanding though that it is not exactly identical to it , but there is a monotonic dependence bwteen these two quantities .",
    "we also apply some constraints on the potential * u * :    @xmath16    @xmath17    the first constraint sets average interaction between amino acids to zero , i.e. eliminates non - specific attraction / repulsion between amino acids .",
    "the role of the second constraint is to set dispersion of interaction energies to one . if energy is a linear function of parameters , multiplication of @xmath18 by an arbitrary constant does not change values of @xmath6 score and by setting @xmath19 we chose units of energy .",
    "potential @xmath18 is obtained by maximization of @xmath20 using a procedure for non - linear optimization .",
    "the potential obtained in this way is ( by procedure ) the one which provides the largest energy gaps simultaneously to all proteins in the dataset as far as @xmath21 is an accurate approximation to @xmath13 .",
    "the very important part of the method is choice of alternative conformations to compute @xmath6 scores . in general",
    "one has to use the same set of conformations for sampling and for computing @xmath6 scores .",
    "for example , to optimize potential for threading one has to compute @xmath6 scores using a set of alternative conformations obtained by threading a sequence through representative set of protein structures .",
    "this procedure is not computationally expensive since for threading the set of alternative conformations does not depend on the potential used . to find a potential one needs to generate a set of alternative conformations , and then , use this set to compute individual @xmath6 scores .",
    "however , when dynamic sampling techniques ( monte carlo , molecular dynamics , growth procedures etc ) , are used for _ ab initio _ folding , the set of alternative conformations is not known in advance and , what is more important , depends on the potential applied . in this case one",
    "has to make some assumptions about the ensemble of alternative conformations which will allow to compute average energy @xmath22 and variance of energy @xmath23 over the of ensemble of alternative conformations .",
    "here we show how to optimize pairwise potential for _ ab initio _ folding of a simple model and for threading .        here",
    "we consider pairwise contact potential , i.e. the energy of a conformation is a sum of energies of pairwise contacts between monomers , which are not nearest neighbors in sequence :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 if monomers @xmath26 and @xmath27 are in contact and @xmath28 otherwise .",
    "various definitions of contacts can be used ( kocher , 1994 ) .",
    "@xmath29 defines the type of amino acid residue in position @xmath26 .",
    "potential is given by @xmath18 matrix , where @xmath30 is energy of a contact between amino acids of types @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the optimization of @xmath33 is performed by metropolis monte carlo procedure in space of potentials , i.e. at each step a cell @xmath34 of the matrix * u * is chosen randomly and a small random number @xmath35 $ ] is added to @xmath34 .",
    "this change is accepted if it increases @xmath20 and rejected with probability @xmath36 if it decreases @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is the `` temperature '' of optimization .",
    "optimization of potential starts from a completely random potential and stops when target function changes less than on @xmath39 for last 20000 steps .      for a given sequence , potential * u * and",
    "generated set of alternative conformations @xmath40 one can compute @xmath6 of the native conformation :    @xmath41    where index @xmath42 denotes averaging over alternative conformations .    instead of computing energy of a sequence in each alternative conformation each time we need @xmath6 , we compute some average quantities for the set of conformations and then use them to estimate @xmath6 score for any sequence and any potential .",
    "these average quantities are computed only once which saves significant amount of computer time .",
    "energy of an individual conformation for pairwise hamiltonian , is given by [ eq : ener ] .",
    "hence average energy for the set of conformations is :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is average density of contacts between residues number @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the set of alternative conformations .",
    "@xmath45    note that one can compute the matrix of average density of a contact @xmath44 only _ once _ for set of conformations and then use this matrix to compute average energy for a sequence and any potential * u * ( see eq [ eq : avr_energ ] ) .",
    "similarly for @xmath46 ,    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is contact correlator @xmath49 which depends only on the set conformations and can be computed in advance for a given set . once @xmath44 and @xmath50 are computed one can easily compute a value of @xmath6 score for a given sequence , conformation and potential * u*.",
    "@xmath51      for each protein in the dataset we build an ensemble of alternative conformations which contains conformations of the same compactness as the native one , i.e. the same number of residue - residue contacts .",
    "in fact , instead of generating a huge number of conformations , we assume that ( i ) contacts in the alternative conformations are distributed independently and uniformly and ( ii ) the number of contacts is the same as in the native conformation .",
    "these assumptions allow one to compute average density of contacts @xmath52 and correlator @xmath50 as    @xmath53    and @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of contacts in the native conformation , @xmath56 is the total number of topologically possible contacts",
    ".    then value of @xmath6 score can be computed for each protein in the dataset and a given potential * u * using eq [ eq : zmain ] .",
    "lattice model simulations show that sequences having low values of @xmath6 are able to fold fast to their native conformations ( abkevich _ et al _ , 1994 gutin _",
    "et al _ , 1995 )    to test our method of derivation and compare it with other techniques we first turn to a simple lattice model which allows to test a potential by performing _",
    "ab initio _ folding of a protein starting from random conformation .",
    "then we apply our method to derive the parameters from the dataset of well - resolved protein structures .",
    "the aim of sequence design is to find a sequence which ( for a given potential ) delivers low @xmath6 score to a given conformation .",
    "the procedure starts from random sequence with given amino acid composition . at each step",
    "we choose two residues at random and attempt to permute them .",

    "if this permutation decreases the value of @xmath6 score ( @xmath58 ) , then this permutation is accepted , otherwise ( @xmath59 ) permutation is rejected with probability @xmath60 .",
    "the procedure stops when either no changes in sequence has occured in the last @xmath61 steps or if a preset value of @xmath6 score is reached ( @xmath62 ) . using this procedure and setting different values @xmath62 we are able to generate sequences which provide the required value of @xmath6 score to a given conformation .",
    "we consider a conformation of a protein chain as a self - avoiding walk on a cubic lattice .",
    "two amino acids which are not nearest neighbors in sequence and located in the next vertices of the lattice are said to be in contact .",
    "energy of a conformation is given by the equation ( [ eq : ener ] ) .",
    "the dataset of lattice proteins consists of 200 randomly chosen compact conformations of 27-mer on 3x3x3 cube ( shakhnovich and gutin , 1990 ; shakhnovich _ et al _ , 1991 ; sali _ et al _ , 1994b ; socci and onuchic , 1994 ) .",
    "we derive the potential using first 100 of the lattice proteins and test the derived potential for the remaining 100 lattice proteins from the dataset .",

    "the stability and folding of each designed sequence is tested by monte - carlo folding simulation , each starting from random coil ( shakhnovich _ et al _ , 1991 ; sali _ et al _ , 1994 ) and reaching their respective native conformations .      to obtain the potential which minimizes @xmath6 scores for model proteins , we use monte carlo procedure in space of potentials (",
    "see above ) .",
    "starting from different random potentials monte carlo search converges fast , and the resulting potential does not depend on starting random potential .",

    "this shows that there is only one minimum in space of potentials in our model .",

    "repulsive interactions , in contrast , are very rear among native contacts and therefore the statistics is much poorer for them . some repulsive contacts can not be found in the dataset of model proteins .",
    "in contrast , contacts between _ all _ amino acids are present among native contacts in real proteins ( see below ) .",
    "the absence of contacts between some types of amino acids in the model dataset is the result of very strong sequence design .",

    "this potential , however , fails to provide reasonable gap for other proteins and is not similar ( @xmath76 ) to the true potential . as the number of proteins in the database increases , the average energy gap decreases approaching rather high constant value of ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "correlation between derived and true potentials approaches constant value @xmath78 . to ensure that derived potential converges to a meaningful value as the number of proteins in the database increases , we compare potential obtained for @xmath73 proteins with the one obtained for all @xmath79 proteins .",

    "the results of this procedure clearly demonstrate the stability of our procedure .",
    "it is also important that the potential which is highly correlated with the true one ( @xmath81 ) can be obtained with only @xmath82 proteins , which is of the order of the size of the database of non - homologous stable disulfide - free proteins available from the pdb .",
    "an important issue is whether the number of parameters adjusted in the potential is sufficient to provide large gap for all proteins with designed sequences . e.g.",
    "two - letter ( hp ) models are too nonspecific to make native structure unique : for any sequence many conformations of 3-dimensional hp heteropolymers have the same lowest , global minimum energy .",
    "native state in such models is not unique in most cases ; correspondingly no sequence , random or designed can have any energy gap in hp models ( yue _ et al _ , 1995 ) .    on the other hand the number of parameters should not be too large because in this case , it will always be possible to find a `` potential '' for which all members of the database used in the derivation have low energies , but the resulting potential has nothing to do with the `` true '' potential and it will not provide low energy to proteins which are not members of the derivation database .    more specifically , the question is whether the problem of finding parameters is under - determined or over - determined , i.e how the number of independent functions to minimize @xmath6-scores of individual proteins is related to the number of independent parameters . for an over - determined problem",
    "the number of functions / constraints is greater than the number of parameters and , hence , there is no solution which minimizes well all the functions .",
    "this is not the case for our designed sequences , since there is `` true '' potential which provides large enough gap for all proteins .",
    "below we address this question for native sequences of real proteins .",
    "if the problem is under - determined , then the number of functions / constraints is less than the number of parameters and one can find infinitely many solutions minimizing all functions .",
    "this is the case when the number of proteins in the database is small . as we have shown above ,",
    "the potential derived for few proteins provides for them the average energy gap greater than provided by the `` true '' potential , but it shares no similarity with the `` true '' potential .    however , as the number of proteins in the database increases , average gap approaches that for the true potential and the derived potential becomes very similar to the true one . to ensure that we _ do not have too many parameters _ we made the control procedure with randomly shuffled sequences .      as a control we carried out the derivation procedure for our database of model proteins using shuffled sequences instead of the designed ones for each protein . in this case",
    "one should not expect that there exists any potential which makes all the native structures to be of low energy for randomly shuffled sequences , i.e in this case our procedure should not lead to any meaningful solution .",
    "what happens in this case ?",
    "again , for a a few ( @xmath75 ) proteins one can find a potential which provides large enough energy gap ( @xmath83 ) for randomly shuffled sequences ( see figure [ fig : converge]a ) .",
    "however , in contrast to the designed sequences , average energy gap drops substantially to a marginal level of @xmath84 as number of proteins in the database increases .",
    "clearly , there is no correlation between the true potential and potential derived for database with shuffled sequences ( see figure [ fig : converge2 ] ) .",
    "there is also no correlation ( @xmath85 ) between potential obtained for @xmath79 proteins with shuffled sequences and potentials obtained for @xmath86 of these proteins .",
    "hence , the procedure does not converge to any potential for proteins with randomly shuffled sequences .",
    "consequently , no pairwise potential can provide stability simultaneously to all of native conformations with the shuffled sequences .",
    "comparison of the results for designed sequences with the control case of shuffled sequences suggests that the problem of finding a pairwise potential is not under - determined , i.e. @xmath87 parameters of the potential are sufficient to provide large gap for designed sequences and are not sufficient to provide large gap for any pair of sequence and conformation .",
    "note that the procedure is able to distinguish between designed and randomly shuffled sequences without prior information about the potential used for the design.designed sequences show the convergence of average energy gap @xmath88 to a level of @xmath89 as number of proteins increases .",
    "potential is converging which is seen from high correlation between potentials obtained for different number of proteins in the dataset .",

    "hence , we are able to find a potential which maximizes , for the given model , the energy gap for all native proteins simultaneously .",

    "using our procedure one can compare different models quantitatively and select better one which provides larger energy gaps for native proteins .      using the lattice model and native proteins",
    ", we demonstrated that our procedure is able to reconstruct `` true '' potential sufficiently accurate if sequences in the database are well designed .",
    "is this requirement too restrictive ?",
    "how well can we reconstruct potential for proteins with poorly designed sequences ?    to mimic poor design of native proteins observed in our model , for each protein structure , we designed sequences which provide the same value of energy gap as the native sequence does .",

    "the result shows that our procedure reconstructs potential for poorly designed sequences very well providing correlation @xmath106 with the true potential .",
    "poor design of native sequences in our model does not affect quality of reconstruction of the true potential .",
    "as we have demonstrated above , native proteins are rather poorly designed in terms of the pairwise potential .",
    "the best possible pairwise potential provides rather small energy gap to the native proteins , which is characterized by the typical value of @xmath107 .",
    "well designed proteins have , in contrast , @xmath108 and may be able to fold to their native conformation , as lattice model simulations suggest .",
    "the question is whether poorly designed sequences can fold as well .    to address this question we turn to the `` ideal '' lattice model and",
    "build a dataset of @xmath109 poorly - designed proteins .",
    "proteins in this dataset are designed to have @xmath107 .",
    "then we derived potential for this dataset as described above and performed folding simulations for all sequences using `` true '' and derived potential .",
    "the result is that no protein was able to fold to its native conformation neither with derived nor with the `` true '' potential .    in _ all _ cases",
    "there was a conformation which has an energy below the energy of the native conformation .",
    "hence ,    * the native conformation is _ not _ the global energy minimum for a poorly designed protein ; * poorly designed proteins are unable to fold to their native conformations in _ ab initio _ folding simulations .",
    "sampling techniques which are more constrained to protein - like conformations ( finkelstein and reva , 1991 ; jones _ et al _ , 1992 ; wodak and rooman , 1993 ) can , however , recognize the native and native - like folds among small enough pool of alternative conformations .",
    "the success of different pairwise potentials for the fold recognition shows that this sampling technique works quite well even for poorly designed proteins .",
    "using our set of poorly designed sequences we made fold recognition tests for all lattice model proteins by threading sequence of each protein through 200 alternative conformations .",
    "only 3 out of 200 sequences recognized non - native conformation as those of the lowest energy .",
    "this result is in contrast to previous observation that for any protein in this set native conformation was not the global energy minimum .",
    "hence , the only reason why fold recognition works for 197 proteins is that a set of decoys was not too large and representative so that the native conformation had the lowest energy .    not surprisingly , the comparison of the results of _ ab initio _ folding simulations and fold recognition indicates that folding is a much more complicated problem than fold recognition since much greater energy gap is required for success in folding than in fold recognition .    the question whether poorly designed proteins can be used for recognition of the native fold in threading experiments yet to be studied systematically",
    "several knowledge - based techniques for derivation of potentials from native protein structures have been suggested .",
    "it is important to compare our potential with other pairwise potentials , and our method of derivation with other methods .",
    "figure [ fig : z_vs_id ] presents @xmath6 scores computed for proteins of our database using our potential and two other potentials taken from the literature .",
    "clearly our potential provides significantly lower values of @xmath6 score for all proteins in the database .",
    "two other potentials perform good as well providing rather low @xmath6 scores .",
    "although potentials were obtained using different techniques , the overall profiles of @xmath6 score for this dataset of proteins are very similar for all three potentials , i.e. when a protein has low @xmath6 score with one potential it usually has low @xmath6 score with another one .",
    "high correlations between values of @xmath6 score provided by these three potentials for the same set of proteins ( @xmath110 @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) indicate that high or low value of @xmath6 score is a property of a protein itself irrespective of potential used .",
    "different proteins are known to have different stability , i.e. different quality of design , which is displayed by high or low value of @xmath6 score .",
    "it is important to compare not only potentials by themselves but also the techniques for derivation of potential .",
    "our ideal lattice model is very useful for this purpose .",
    "we apply different techniques to the same set of lattice proteins and test obtained potentials in the same way we did this for our technique .    here",
    "we compare four techniques for derivation of potential .",
    "first two are widely used statistical knowledge - based method to derive energy of residue - residue and residue - solvent interactions .",
    "knowledge - based techniques are reproduced following miyazawa and jernigan ( 1985 , 1996 ) ( mj ) and hinds and levitt ( 1995 ) ( hl ) .",
    "the third tested technique is the procedure suggested by goldstein _ at al _ (",
    "1992 ) ( gsw ) .",
    "this procedure is somewhat similar to out method since the potential is obtained to maximize ratio @xmath113 , which is similar the @xmath6 score we use .",
    "et al _ found analytic expression for potential which maximizes @xmath113 for one protein . to find the potential for a set of proteins they used averaging which is not justified but it yielded good results .",
    "we followed the procedure described in ( goldstein _ at al _ 1992 ) to test their technique .",
    "note that both gsw procedure and ours are optimization techniques , whereas hl and mj are statistical knowledge based ones .",
    "the results for different techniques are summarized in table [ tab : kb_wg_ms ] .",
    "our potential is aimed to minimize harmonic mean @xmath6 score and , as expected , provides the value of @xmath21 lower than other potentials .",
    "gsw procedure gives only slightly higher values of mean @xmath6 which proves that both optimization techniques are powerful enough to provide large energy gap for proteins of a dataset .",
    "knowledge - based techniques provide large energy gap as well .",
    "the drastic difference between knowledge - based technique and optimization techniques becomes transparent when we compare @xmath6 scores obtained for different derived potentials with @xmath6 scores provided by the `` true '' potential ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : z_vs_id2 ] ) .",
    "both optimization techniques provide @xmath6 scores which are lower than @xmath6 for the `` true '' potentials .",
    "knowledge - based techniques , in contrast , provide @xmath6 scores higher that those for the `` true '' potential .",
    "hence , knowledge - based potentials provide smaller energy gap than the `` true '' potential does , whereas potentials obtained by optimization deliver the energy gap which is greater than those for the `` true '' potential .",
    "the decrease of energy gap by knowledge - based potentials can be crucial for _ ab initio _ folding , especially for weakly designed proteins which have rather small gap even with the `` true '' potential .",
    "all tested techniques are also quite efficient in reconstruction of the `` true '' potential exhibiting , however , different patterns of distortion of the original potential . both optimization techniques tend to underestimate repulsive interactions ( see figure [ fig : derived_vs_true.lattice ] ) .",
    "knowledge - based techniques , in contrast , provide good estimates of energies of repulsive interactions , suffering from underestimation of attractive interactions ( see figure [ fig : mjlike_vs_true ] ) .",
    "attractive interactions are responsible for stabilization of the native conformation and underestimation of attractive interactions leads to the observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : z_vs_id2 ] ) increase in @xmath6 score for knowledge - based potentials .",
    "another deformation of the `` true '' potential by mj technique is that it yields strong non - specific attraction between residues , which is seen as low negative average interaction between residues ( @xmath114 when @xmath115 set to 1 ) .",
    "this non - specific attraction favors more compact conformation irrespective to amino acid sequence .",
    "this effect can mislead _ ab initio _ folding and fold recognition .",
    "the origin of this non - specific attraction is in residue - solvent interactions taken into account by mj procedure .",
    "estimate of the number of solvent - solvent interactions is responsible for the non - specific attraction .",
    "although all derivation procedures reconstruct the `` true '' potential with systematic deviations , all potentials are able to provide large enough energy gap for well designed model sequences .",
    "in this work we proposed and tested a novel systematic approach to the long - standing problem of how to find the correct potential for protein folding .",
    "in contrast to widely - used knowledge - based statistical technique , which relies on hardly justifiable assumption of boltzmann statistics , we use optimization in space of parameters to search for a potential which maximizes stability of all native proteins in the dataset .",
    "the procedure was tested using the `` ideal '' model where sequences were designed with some known , `` true '' potential and the recovered potential turned out to be quite close to the `` true '' one .",
    "the key feature of `` ideal '' models ( both lattice and off - lattice ) is that the form of the energy function ( two - body contact hamiltonian ) is `` exact '' , and the goal of the parameter search is to determine 210 numbers - parameters of this hamiltonian .",
    "we showed that our procedure recovers the parameters reliably and uniquely .",
    "it is important to note that it is not crucial for our method that sequences in the database are well - designed : in fact derivation of potentials using the database of weakly designed sequences ( i.e. having relatively high z - score ) yielded the potentials which were similarly quite close to the `` true '' potential .",
    "this is in contrast to the control case of assigning randomly shuffled sequences to structures : for them our procedure did not converge to any meaningful potential . in this case addition of any new `` protein '' ( in fact a structure with a random sequence assigned to it ) changed the potential dramatically , consistent with the notion that there is no potential which delivers low energy to all structure - random sequence pairs .",
    "in contrast , even for weakly designed sequences there is the potential for which these sequences have low ( but perhaps not the lowest ) energy in their corresponding native conformations , and such potential is readily recovered by our optimization technique .",
    "the method has internal controls of self - consistency .",
    "first is that the optimization procedure in parameter space converges rapidly and at all algorithmic temperatures to unique solution ( no multiple - minima problem in space of parameters ) .",
    "this suggests that the obtained solution delivers global minimum of @xmath6 scores for studied proteins : no other potential can provide , in average , lower @xmath6 scores for the same structures and sequences in the same model .",
    "another important test of self - consistency of the proposed method is convergence of potentials when the database size grows .",
    "this clearly points out that the problem is not undertermined as well as it indicates clearly that there indeed exists a potential with which all structures have low energy .",
    "this criterion is especially important and useful when we consider more complicated , than pairwise contact , energy functions ( see below ) .",
    "the `` ideal '' models provide ideal opportunity to compare our new method with other approaches , in particular with the methods based on quasichemical approximation .",
    "comparison of the `` true '' potential with the ones derived by miyazawa and jernigan ( 1996 ) and hinds and levitt ( 1995 ) methods ( including most demanding _ ab initio _ folding tests ) shows that procedures based on the quasichemical approximation can extract potential with impressive accuracy .",
    "this conclusion is in contrast with the assertion of thomas and dill ( 1996 ) who also tested mj procedure using lattice model and argued that the extracted potential is not an accurate approximation of the `` true '' potential .",
    "we believe that the most important criterion of success of extracted potential is how it performs in _ ab initio _ folding or threading tests .",
    "thomas and dill s test is similar in spirit to threading because they addressed the issue of how often the global energy minimum structure remains such with extracted potentials , judged by exhaustive enumeration of conformations .",
    "they considered all sequences ( having unique native state ) for 14-mers and 16-mers with random sequences .",
    "however , the native conformations of random sequences ( as well as other sequences having no or minimal energy gap ) are extremely unstable with respect to any uncertainties in potentials ( bryngelson , 1993 ) .",
    "this is in contrast with folding sequences ( with energy gaps ) which were shown to be much more robust with respect to uncertainties in potentials ( pande et al , 1995 ) .",
    "unfortunately , there are no sequences in hp model which have energy gaps ( thomas _ et al _ , 1995 ) , and one can not even design such sequences in hp model .",
    "therefore we believe that the major reason of the conclusion made by thomas and dill ( 1996 ) is that they used the model where native conformation is unstable with respect to even minor uncertainties in potentials .",
    "it is important to note also that models where sequences do not have energy gap are equally unstable with respect to point mutations ( shakhnovich and gutin , 1991 ) .",
    "the remarkable stability of proteins with respect to many point mutations is another strong evidence that real proteins should have a pronounced energy gap , a property absent in hp models .",
    "building a set of alternative conformations to compute @xmath6 score is an important part of this work .",
    "all results discussed here have been obtained under the following assumptions regarding the presentation of alternative conformations : ( i ) all alternative conformations have the same compactness as the native conformation ; ( ii ) all contacts are equally probable and ( iii ) they are statistically independent in the set of alternative conformations .",
    "these assumptions allowed us to compute @xmath6 score for a protein without building the set of alternative conformations explicitly .",
    "in fact , in order to compute the @xmath6 score for pairwise potential one needs to calculate the average frequency of a contact and covariance of two contacts in the set of alternative conformations .",
    "the first assumption states that the number of contacts in alternative conformations is the same as in the native one . assuming compactness of alternative conformations we eliminate the effect of non - specific attraction / repulsion in the recognition of the native conformation .",
    "non - specific attraction introduced into potential favors most compact conformations irrespective of amino acid sequence , which can give rise to false positives : very compact low energy conformations for any protein in the fold recognition test .",
    "one should be careful about non - specific term in a potential as it can substantially affect the results of _ ab initio _ folding or fold recognition .",
    "on the other hand , these nonspecific terms can be readily eliminated by shifting the parameters by a given value ( shakhnovich , 1994 ; gutin _ et al _ , 1995 ) .    by assuming equal probability for all contacts we neglect slight prevalence of contacts between amino acids close to each other along the polypeptide chain , which exists even in random coil . however , since alternative conformations have the same compactness as the native one local contacts are not expected to dominate in these conformations ( abkevich _ et al _ , 1995 ) .",
    "different probabilities of local and non - local contacts can be taken into account by assigning higher probabilities to local contacts in the set of unfolded conformations used in calculation of @xmath6-score .",
    "our assumption of independent contacts is strictly valid only for point - size non - connected objects .",
    "chain connectivity enforces positive correlation between contacts @xmath116 and @xmath117 for small @xmath118 . on the other hand ,",
    "excluded volume of amino acids leads to anti - correlation between contacts @xmath116 and @xmath119 since amino acid @xmath26 can have only a limited number of contacts due to excluded volume interactions .",
    "several other factors can contribute to correlation between contacts in the opposite ways and the final outcome of these effects has yet to be understood .",
    "the set of alternative conformations built in this way turned out to be adequate for estimating the energy gap , in our model , since lattice proteins which have low enough @xmath6 scores are able to fold fast to their native conformations .    in general , while deriving a potential for a particular task and sampling procedure ( fold recognition , design of an inhibitor , _ ab initio _ folding etc ) one has to construct a set of alternative conformations which which will be used as decoys during the sampling .",
    "alternative conformations used in this work correspond more closely ( though not exactly ) to sampling by folding under the condition of average attractive interaction between aminoacids , while fold recognition is likely to have a different set of decoys .",
    "this set of decoys should be used in our procedure of derivation of potentials for fold recognition .",
    "it can be implemented by explicit generation of alternative conformations for a given protein by threading its sequence through other proteins structures of the database .",
    "frequency of contacts and contact correlations computed for alternative conformations built in this way are to be used for computing @xmath6 scores and derivation of potential . while derived , the potential will provide the highest possible @xmath6 score for fold recognition .",
    "this work is currently in progress .",
    "now we turn to the discussion of the results obtained for real proteins .",
    "first of all we see that pairwise contact approximation is not meaningless for real proteins , i.e. certain aspects of their energetics are captured by that model .",
    "the clear evidence for that is that our procedure converges to a unique potential , and the @xmath6-scores of proteins with that potential are considerably lower than for randomly shuffled sequences .",
    "this suggests that such a simplified hamiltonian still carries some `` signal '' . in this sense",
    "the derived two - body potentials are useful since they are able to discriminate between native conformation and decoys , when the number of decoys is not too large .",
    "however , the @xmath6-scores obtained for proteins within the pairwise contact hamiltonian approximation are not sufficiently low to provide high stability ( or large energy gap ) for all proteins simultaneously .",
    "hence all knowledge - based potentials can have only limited success in folding or recognition of the native fold among alternative conformations .",
    "this result can help in understanding of the origin of problems arising with various structure prediction techniques .",
    "our results suggest that limited success in folding simulations in the simple model with pairwise potentials may be due not to incorrect `` potentials '' ( i.e. 210 numbers ) but rather due to the deficiency of the model itself , and no other potentials within the same model of pairwise contact interactions can provide better results uniformly for numerous tested proteins ( of course there can be successes with `` potential '' which are optimized to fold just one protein ( hao and sheraga , 1996 ) ; however , as our analysis shows , such potential ( speaking in our terms , derived by optimization from the database of one protein ) will fail when used to fold another protein .",
    "several models have been suggested for protein folding which vary in accuracy of structure representation and in complexity of the energy function . what is the optimal number of parameters of the energy function ?",
    "how does the number of parameters affect the results of the procedure to extract potentials ? to address these questions we developed convergence test which allows to estimate stability of the obtained potential with respect to the dataset of proteins used .",
    "this test indicates whether the number of parameters used to maximize the energy gap ( 210 in the case on contact pairwise potential ) is large enough to provide the gap for all proteins simultaneously and is small enough not to overfit the data and adopt any random sequence to a protein structure in the database .",
    "our results indicate that 210 parameters of contact pairwise potential are not too many ( potential converges as the size of the database increases ) , but the model itself is not sufficiently realistic to provide the large gap for real proteins .",
    "more accurate presentation of energy function , ( possibly including local conformational preferences , distance dependent interactions , multibody interactions etc . ) is likely to be necessary to achieve better discrimination between the native structure and decoys .",
    "the presented method allows to assess systematically the validity of different models and therefore can serve as a powerful tool for the search of the most adequate model for protein folding .",
