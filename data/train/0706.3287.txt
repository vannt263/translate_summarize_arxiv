    "novel properties and new scenarios are expected for nuclei situated far from stability .",
    "the new generation of radioactive beam facilities will allow to answer many open questions about the pecularities of these unstable systems .",
    "one of the major issues in the physics of exotic nuclei is the study of shell structure and magicity evolution when approaching the drip lines @xcite . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "two aspects have been underlined as mainly responsible for the evolution of single - particle energies far from stability , the one - body spin - orbit potential which is strongly modified when the surface becomes more diffuse @xcite and the tensor force between neutrons and protons in valence sub - shells @xcite .",
    "recently , the @xmath3 shell closure has been experimentally analyzed in the @xmath4ar(@xmath5)@xmath6ar transfer reaction @xcite .",
    "a strong reduction of the neutron @xmath7 spin - orbit splitting has been observed in @xmath6ar with respect to the isotone @xmath8ca . since",
    "@xmath7 states are mainly localized in the interior of the nucleus , this strong reduction can not be justified by the presence of a diffuse surface which would affect only high-@xmath9 states mainly concentrated at the surface . a theoretical analysis based on the relativistic mean field ( rmf )",
    "approach has been proposed by todd - rutel et al .",
    "@xcite . it predicts a strong reduction of the spin - orbit splitting for neutron @xmath10-states in @xmath4ar as compared to @xmath2ca . at @xmath11",
    ", the state @xmath0 is usually located between @xmath12 and @xmath1 . in the rmf calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , @xmath0 is predicted less bound than @xmath1 in both @xmath4ar and @xmath2ca ( @xmath13 inversion ) . in this scenario , @xmath0 is empty in @xmath4ar and occupied in @xmath2ca : thus , the proton density profile in @xmath4ar presents a strong depletion in the interior of the nucleus .",
    "this reduction of the charge density in the center would be responsible for the modification of the spin - orbit in the nuclear interior and , , for the reduction of the neutron @xmath10-splitting .",
    "this problem of @xmath13 inversion of the proton states has been already analyzed by campi and sprung @xcite within the hartree - fock ( hf ) + bcs model with an interaction derived from a g - matrix @xcite .",
    "@xmath14ar was found as a candidate for this inversion .",
    "skyrme forces do not predict any inversion in this nucleus .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to revisit the problem for other nuclei in this region of the nuclear chart in the framework of the skyrme - hf model . in this work ,",
    "we analyze the evolution of the @xmath15 proton single - particle states in ca isotopes and the possible @xmath13 inversions .",
    "we also present some comparisons with the corresponding results obtained within rmf .",
    "we neglect pairing in our treatment since ca isotopes are proton closed - shell nuclei .",
    "we have checked that , within rmf the inclusion of neutron pairing does not modify in a significant way the evolution of the proton states we are interested in",
    ". the only important effect due to pairing is the shift of the drip line towards heavier isotopes ( for example , the drip line is shifted from @xmath16 to @xmath17ca with the parametrization nl3 @xcite ) .",
    "however , this aspect is not relevant in the present analysis which is not intended to make any prediction on the drip line position .",
    "we choose the ca isotopes since experimental signals for the inversion phenomena have been found at least in one of these isotopes , @xmath2ca : the ground state of @xmath6k ( one proton less than @xmath2ca ) is @xmath18 with a large spectroscopic factor @xcite and the single - particle spectrum of @xmath2ca has been measured , the proton state @xmath1 being more bound than @xmath0 by about 300 kev @xcite . in our analysis , we explore all the contributions , kinetic , central , spin - orbit and tensor , which can modify the single - particle energies with increasing @xmath19 and we show that not only the spin - orbit and tensor terms are determinant .",
    "the role of the central mean field term is in particular discussed . within the models which predict the crossing between the two states",
    ", we show that this inversion occurs near @xmath2ca as well as in very neutron - rich nuclei close to the drip line .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we study the evolution with increasing @xmath19 of the difference @xmath20 between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 energies obtained within non - relativistic and relativistic approaches . in sec .",
    "iii we concentrate on the non - relativistic case and perform a detailed analysis of the results .",
    "the different contributions to @xmath20 are isolated by analyzing them with the equivalent potential in the schroedinger - like hf equations . in sec .",
    "iv the effect of the tensor force is estimated in the framework of the sly5-hf @xcite model .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in sec . v.",
    "we first perform a preliminary study with hf calculations of @xmath2ca using different skyrme interactions .",
    "we then choose three representative forces : ski5 @xcite which predicts a @xmath13 inversion with an energy difference @xmath20 of @xmath21 800 kev , sgii @xcite which also reproduces the inversion ( @xmath20 @xmath21 200 kev ) and sly4 @xcite for which there is no inversion .",
    "with the three selected parametrizations we have systematically analyzed the ca isotopes from @xmath22ca up to the hf two - neutron drip line .",
    "we recall that , in the three considered skyrme parametrizations there is no explicit tensor force .",
    "we show in fig . 1 the difference @xmath20 between the energies of the proton states @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the three skyrme forces .",
    "the inversion takes place where @xmath20 is positive .",
    "corrections to the individual energies due to the coupling of single particle motion with collective vibrations , which are neglected in our treatment , should be expected ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "however , by considering the energy difference instead of the individual single - particle energies the effects of these corrections should be reduced , the coupling to vibrations having the tendency of shifting upwards the energies of both occupied states .",
    "we observe that the sly4-hf calculations never predict the @xmath0-@xmath1 inversion . on the other hand ,",
    "both ski5-hf and sgii - hf predict this inversion around @xmath2ca as well as for more neutron - rich isotopes starting from @xmath23ca up to the drip line .",
    "the hf two - neutron drip line is located at @xmath24ca , @xmath25ca and @xmath26ca with ski5 , sgii and sly4 , respectively .",
    "the two experimental points for @xmath22ca and @xmath2ca are also included in the figure .",
    "the three sets of results globally present the same behavior .",
    "indeed , in all three cases the quantity @xmath20 starts from a negative value and increases from a=40 to a=48 .",
    "this generates a @xmath0-@xmath1 inversion with ski5 ( in @xmath4ca , @xmath2ca and @xmath27ca ) and with sgii ( in @xmath2ca ) . going from @xmath2ca up to @xmath28ca the states cross again with ski5 and sgii , while the distance between them increases with sly4 . beyond @xmath28ca",
    "@xmath20 increases again with the three parametrizations .",
    "this generates another inversion with ski5 and sgii starting from @xmath23ca .",
    "we notice also that the nuclei for which @xmath20 presents maxima or minima are the same for the three skyrme forces .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether the above general trends are specific of the skyrme - hf approach .",
    "it is well known that the rmf approach gives a spin - orbit potential whose ( n - z ) dependence is somewhat different from that of skyrme - hf models@xcite .",
    "we have performed rmf calculations with different parametrizations for the same set of ca isotopes using the parametrizations ddme1 @xcite , nl3 @xcite and nlb2 @xcite .",
    "the latter one is chosen as an example of rmf model which does not lead to a @xmath0-@xmath1 level inversion .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath20 are shown in fig . 2 up to @xmath26ca which is the two - neutron drip line isotope predicted by ddme1 and nl3 .",
    "globally , we observe for @xmath20 the same trend as that obtained within the non relativistic hf , with maxima and minima corresponding to the same nuclei , @xmath2ca and @xmath28ca . since comparable trends are obtained in both non - relativistic and relativistic approaches we conclude that the calculated evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 states is a generic behavior",
    ". we can thus explore more in detail the results by considering only the non - relativistic case .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    we now concentrate on the maxima and minima of @xmath20 .",
    "they correspond to nuclei with neutron closed shells or sub - shells : the maximum at @xmath2ca corresponds to the closure of the neutron @xmath29 orbital whereas the minimum at @xmath28ca corresponds to the filling of the neutron @xmath30 state . in the non relativistic skyrme - hf model",
    "the radial hf equations can be expressed in terms of an energy - dependent equivalent potential @xmath31 : @xmath32 + v_{eq}^{lj } ( r,\\epsilon ) \\psi(r)=\\epsilon \\psi(r)~ , \\label{new1}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 \\epsilon~ , \\label{new2}\\ ] ] with @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "@xmath35 is the spin - orbit hf potential and @xmath36 is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the central hf potentials and @xmath39 is the effective mass @xcite . for protons",
    "@xmath40 includes the coulomb potential .",
    "up to a normalization factor the hf radial wave function @xmath41 of energy @xmath42 is related to the solution @xmath43 of eq.([new1 ] ) by the relation @xmath44 . from eqs .",
    "( [ new1])-([3 ] ) we can write @xmath20 as @xmath45 \\\\ + \\left [ \\frac { \\langle v_{eq}^{centr.}\\rangle_s } { \\langle m^*/m \\rangle_s } -\\frac{\\langle v_{eq}^{centr.}\\rangle_d}{\\langle m^*/m \\rangle_d } \\right ]",

    "the 3 terms of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) - kinetic , central and spin - orbit - are plotted in fig . 3 for the force ski5 and the nuclei @xmath22ca , @xmath2ca , @xmath28ca and @xmath47ca .",
    "similar results are obtained with sly4 and sgii .",
    "we mention that the mean value of the effective mass in the denominators of eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) has very little a - dependence from @xmath22ca to@xmath47ca .    from fig .",
    "3 , one notices that the spin - orbit and kinetic terms present a regular behavior as a function of @xmath19 . both of them are weakened with increasing isospin asymmetry favouring the inversion in very neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "the spin - orbit term is weakened because the neutron surface becomes more diffuse with increasing @xmath19 . in general , the kinetic energy of an orbital depends on the mean distance between its single - particle energy and the bottom of the potential in the region where the wave function is localized .",
    "for the two states @xmath0 and @xmath1 we can look at the difference @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the root mean square ( r.m.s . )",
    "radius of the corresponding wave function .",
    "the evolution of @xmath31 with increasing @xmath19 is governed by two effects : i ) the lowering of the proton potential due to the symmetry term ; ii ) the formation of a neutron skin which modifies the proton distribution by pulling it towards larger radii .",
    "the intensity of these two effects depends on the quantum numbers of the neutron orbitals which are filled and of the proton wave function under study . as an illustration",
    ", we consider @xmath28ca and @xmath47ca .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "radii @xmath49 and the values @xmath50 are shown in table i for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states . from @xmath28ca",
    "to @xmath47ca the difference @xmath51 is reduced more for @xmath1 ( 4.9@xmath52 ) than for @xmath0 ( 0.4@xmath52 ) .",
    "this analysis is confirmed by the evolution of the two r.m.s .",
    ".the values of @xmath49 and @xmath53 , for the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 in @xmath28ca and @xmath47ca .",
    "the interaction is ski5 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is evident that , going from @xmath28ca to @xmath47ca , the @xmath1 wave function is more affected than @xmath0 by the enlarging of the potential due to the formation of a thick neutron skin .",
    "this explains the increase of the kinetic contribution to @xmath54 with the neutron number .",
    "we consider now the central term of eq.([e5 ] ) which is responsible for the maxima and minima of @xmath20 , and concentrate on the maximum at @xmath2ca .",
    "we mention that the major role played by the central term in modifying the single particle energies has been also underlined by gaudefroy et al .",
    "we introduce the quantities @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 which correspond to the contributions of the 3 terms of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "they are plotted in fig . 4 for @xmath22ca , @xmath2ca and @xmath28ca .",
    "it turns out that the term mainly affected by the neutron shell structure is @xmath55 which    contains the hartree - fock potential .",
    "we can separate the energy contributions of the n = z=20 core from those of the excess neutrons .",
    "for instance , the total nucleon density @xmath58 is a sum of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and similarly for the other types of densities .",
    "then , for any hf quantity the core contribution is obtained by replacing in its expression the total densities by core densities whereas the neutron excess contribution corresponds to the rest .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "5 the core and neutron excess contributions to @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear that the change of slope at @xmath2ca is mainly due to the neutron excess contribution .",
    "we have further verified that the term mainly responsible is the @xmath61 term of the skyrme force . the density - dependent term ( @xmath62 term )",
    "is also sensitive to the neutron shell structure but with an opposite behavior reducing the effect due to the @xmath61 term .",
    "hence , the main parameters which influence the behavior of @xmath54 are @xmath63 and @xmath61 as well as @xmath64 , @xmath62 and @xmath65 .",
    "we have checked that the role played by the other terms of the hf potential is negligible .    to complete our analysis",
    "we consider separately the two single - particle energies @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we have verified that the maximum of @xmath20 at @xmath2ca is mostly due to the energy of the @xmath1 state which decreases less rapidly from @xmath2ca to @xmath28ca than from @xmath22ca to @xmath2ca .",
    "this behavior is explained in fig .",
    "6 . in the top panels the neutron excess contribution @xmath66 to the hf potential due to the @xmath61 and @xmath62 terms",
    "is plotted for @xmath67ca , @xmath2ca and @xmath28ca ( see e.g. @xcite for the expressions in terms of the skyrme force parameters ) . in the middle panels we show the squares of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 radial wave functions multiplied by @xmath68 . in the bottom panels the products @xmath69 are shown . since @xmath66 is negative ( the @xmath61 contribution is negative and the largest in absolute value )",
    "the proton single - particle energies are lowered with increasing n - z , as expected .",
    "we observe that , in @xmath67ca and @xmath2ca the potential related to the neutron excess ( @xmath29 neutron orbital ) is concentrated in the region where the @xmath1 wave function is localized .",
    "the overlap with this wave function is thus the largest and this explains why the filling of the neutron @xmath29 orbital has an important effect on the proton @xmath1 energy which is strongly lowered . on the other hand , when the neutron @xmath30 orbital is filled ( from @xmath2ca to @xmath28ca ) the potential changes very little in the region where the @xmath1 wave function is appreciable .",
    "this explains why the @xmath1 energy decreases more from a=44 to 48 than from a=48 to 52 .",
    "the energy of the @xmath0 proton state is much less sensitive to the neutron shell structure in these isotopes and it decreases rather monotonically from a=44 to 52 .",
    "the tensor force plays certainly a role in the evolution of single - particle states .",
    "this is discussed , e.g. , in the framework of the shell model in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a mean field approach ,",
    "the tensor effect originates from the @xmath70-nucleon and @xmath58-nucleon contributions to the fock terms @xcite , and it can be introduced phenomenologically in the parametrizations of effective interactions built for hf models @xcite .",
    "recent progress have been made in determining the tensor terms of skyrme interactions @xcite by adjusting the single - particle spectra measured in n=82 isotones and z=50 isotopes @xcite .",
    "when this force is included the spin - orbit potential presents an additional term depending on the spin density @xmath71 , namely , @xmath72 where @xmath73 stands for neutrons ( protons ) and @xmath74 for protons ( neutrons ) , @xmath65 and @xmath75 consist of a sum of central and tensor contributions : @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "the central contributions depend only on the velocity - dependent part of the skyrme force whereas the tensor contributions are generated by the tensor component of the skyrme force @xcite . to estimate the effect of the tensor force in our case we use the skyrme force sly5 which already contains in the fitting protocol the terms @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "for @xmath80 and @xmath81 we adopt the values determined in ref .",
    "@xcite by comparing the skyrme - hf predictions with the data of ref .",
    "these values are @xmath82 mev @xmath83 and @xmath84 mev @xmath83 .",
    "we expect that the tensor force favors the inversion in @xmath2ca ( see for instance fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . actually , from @xmath22ca",
    "to @xmath2ca the @xmath29 neutron orbital is filled .",
    "the interaction between the proton orbital @xmath1 and the neutron orbital @xmath29 is attractive and its effect is to lower the energy of @xmath1 , thus favoring the crossing with @xmath0 . as an illustration we performed sly5-hf calculations for @xmath22ca , @xmath2ca , @xmath28ca and @xmath47ca ( @xmath47ca is still bound within sly5-hf ) .",
    "we show in fig 7 the values of @xmath20 obtained with and without the tensor contribution .",
    "as expected , the tensor force increases the slope going from @xmath22ca to @xmath2ca bringing the two states close together and improving the agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the improvement is quite strong since the value of @xmath20 in @xmath2ca is equal to -0.26 mev and -1.41 mev with and without the tensor contribution , respectively .",
    "in this article we have analyzed the modification of the proton single - particle states @xmath0 and @xmath1 in ca isotopes within the non - relativistic skyrme - hf and the relativistic rmf models .",
    "pairing effects have been neglected since ca isotopes are proton closed - shell .",
    "we are interested in the evolution of proton states and the inclusion of neutron pairing does not affect significantly the global trend of our results",
    ". both models , hf and rmf , predict the same evolution with increasing @xmath19 for the difference @xmath20 of the energies of the two states .",
    "this evolution depends on the neutron orbitals which are filled , @xmath20 presenting maxima and minima corresponding to neutron shell or sub - shell closures . in particular , going from @xmath22ca to @xmath2ca the two proton states come closer to each other and they can sometimes cross in some models . by performing an analysis based on the equivalent potential in the non - relativistic skyrme - hf approach , we have shown that the kinetic and spin - orbit contributions present quite a regular behavior with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "they both strongly favor the inversion of the two states in very neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "we have also verified that the contribution which is mostly responsible for the maximum of @xmath54 at @xmath2ca ( and leading to an inversion for some models ) is the central hf potential and , in particular the @xmath61 and @xmath62 terms .",
    "the former term favors the crossing of the two states near @xmath2ca whereas the latter acts against it .",
    "the net effect is that the two states get closer and can cross each other in some models .",
    "we have finally analyzed the role of the tensor force within the sly5-hf model and found that its contribution goes in the same direction as the @xmath61 term of the hf potential , favoring the inversion of the states near @xmath2ca .",
    "our analysis was restricted to a purely mean field picture .",
    "work should be done to include effects beyond mean field .",
    "for instance , particle - phonon coupling , which has been neglected here , is expected to improve the quality of the theoretical predictions in the study of single - particle states evolution .",
