    "the spiral arms are very common features in disk galaxies and also found in our galaxy  @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of these complicated structures is not conclusively solved , although many theories are proposed  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggested the spiral structures are long - lived density wave .",
    "however , this was challenged by observations for external galaxies  @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that dynamical tidal interaction can induce spiral structures in a galaxy .",
    "but this is hard to explain why galaxies not experienced major mergers also show spiral arms , such as the milky way .",
    "@xcite argued that the spiral structures are short - lived and formed from the instability .",
    "@xcite further explained that the nature of the recurrent spiral arms are the overlapping of multiple spiral modes .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , claimed that the spiral arms are corotating , i.e. their pattern speeds equal to the circular speeds .    because the dynamical properties of the spiral structures in the milky way is hard to be directly detected , most of the observational works turn to understand the spiral structure through the perturbed stellar velocity distributions  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", many observations revealed that the nearby stars display quite complicated peculiar motions , which may be the result of perturbations , in radial and vertical directions  ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "however , the perturbed velocities ( also called bulk motion , asymmetric motion , streaming velocity , or peculiar velocity in different studies ) may be either induced by the spiral structures , or other non - axisymmetric features , e.g. the galactic bar or the merging dwarf galaxies  @xcite .",
    "there are also some works constraining the forming mechanisms of the spiral structures with the comparison of the locations of the gaseous and stellar arms  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the young stars have different asymmetric motions with the old stars in @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite further compared the radial variation of @xmath3  and @xmath2  between the young and relatively old red clump stars from the lamost survey and found that the radial oscillations of the velocities for the two populations show similar long - wave mode but different short - wave mode .",
    "these observational facts hint that the young stars may contain different types of peculiar velocities .",
    "they may either retain some memory of the kinematical features of their birthplace , or directly reflect the kinematics of the spiral arms , or more sensitive to the perturbations than older populations due to their more circular stellar orbits . in order to investigate the role played by the spiral arms in the peculiar velocities , two - dimensional in - plane velocity field , rather than one - dimensional radial variation of the velocities , is required .",
    "subsequently , the accurate astrometric data , combined with the line - of - sight velocity measured from the stellar spectra , are needed .    as september 14 , 2016 ,",
    "the _ gaia _ survey  @xcite published its first data release  @xcite , including new proper motion estimates with accuracy of @xmath8mas yr@xmath5  for 2 million bright stars  @xcite .",
    "the _ gaia _",
    "dr1 , combined with the spectroscopic data from the lamost dr3 data , allows us to map the three dimensional velocities of the stars within @xmath8kpc around the sun with high accuracy .    in this letter",
    ", we study the in - plane peculiar motions for the young stars in the solar neighborhood using the latest astrometric data from _",
    "gaia_. the data selection and processing are described in section  [ sect : data ] .",
    "the result and discussions are illustrated in section  [ sect : result ] . and",
    "a brief conclusion is drawn in the last section .",
    "the data used in this work are from two surveys , the stellar parameters and the line - of - sight velocities are from the lamost dr3 data  @xcite and the parallaxes and proper motions are from the _ gaia _",
    "dr1  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the distance estimated by @xcite , who applied a bayesian model to derive the distance from the parallax taking into account the milky way prior and systematic uncertainties in _ gaia _ catalog .",
    "there are totally more than 190000 common stars in the two catalogs . from",
    "the lamost derived stellar parameters  @xcite , we select about 15000 young f - type stars with @xmath9k , error of distance from  @xcite smaller than 30% ( including the systematic error of the _ gaia _ parallax ) , and absolute magnitude in @xmath10 band between -1 and 3mag band is derived from the distance provided by  @xcite , the apparent @xmath10 magnitude from 2mass , and the derived interstellar extinction in @xmath10 band according to  @xcite . ] .",
    "because in this work we focus on the disk , we cut the range of vertical distance to the galactic mid - plane with @xmath11kpc .",
    "meanwhile , we cut the distance with @xmath12kpc to ensure the completeness of the data",
    ". then we obtain 6822 f - type stars as the tracers of the young population . in order to characterize the velocities for the young population",
    ", we also select 5088 k - type sub - giant branch ( sgb ) stars with @xmath13k and @xmath14 as the control sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : hrd ] shows the hr diagram of the lamost-_gaia _ common stars overlapped with the parsec isochrones  @xcite with age of 1 , 3 , 6 , and 10gyr at solar metallicity ( magenta lines ) .",
    "it is seen that most of the selected f - type stars ( left white solid box ) are around 13gyr , while the k - type sgb control sample ( the right white dashed box ) are concentrated in the age around 36gyr .",
    "there are some stars with supersolar metallicity in both the young and old populations . according to @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "these very metal - rich stars are likely formed from the inner disk . in order to make sure that the sample are local",
    ", we remove the stars with [ fe / h]@xmath15dex .",
    "we also cut out a few stars with [ fe / h]@xmath16 to exclude most of the contaminations , e.g. the blue straggler stars , from the thick disk and stellar halo populations .",
    "after the cut in metallicity , the number of the rest f - type young stars is 3692 and the number of the rest k - type sgb stars is 2011 .",
    "we adopt that the solar motion w.r.t . the local standard of rest is ( u@xmath17 , v@xmath17 , w@xmath17)=(9.58 , 10.52 , 7.01)kms@xmath5  @xcite , the distance from the sun to the galactic center is @xmath18kpc  @xcite , and the local circular speed is 238kms@xmath5  @xcite",
    ". figure  [ fig : n ] shows the spatial distribution of the young ( left panel ) and old ( right panel ) stars in @xmath0@xmath1 plane , in which @xmath0 points from the galactic center to the outskirt of the disk through the sun and @xmath1 points to the direction of the rotation of the disk . noted that this right - hand coordinates does not fit the usual direction to look at the milky way , i.e. looking it from north galactic pole .",
    "hence , in all rest figures in this letter , we flip the direction of @xmath0-axis so that the milky way is looked from the north galactic pole and the direction of the rotation is upward .",
    "the samples are located within 0.6kpc around the sun .",
    "thus , @xmath1 is approximately equivalent with the azimuth angle .",
    "figure  [ fig : vphi ] shows the maps of the median azimuthal ( @xmath2 ) and radial ( @xmath3 ) velocities in @xmath0@xmath1 plane for the young and old stars , respectively .",
    "the median velocity values are provided only for the bins containing more than 20 stars to ensure the good statistics .",
    "the bin size is 0.125@xmath190.125kpc .",
    "no smoothing technique is applied to these maps .",
    "the local spiral arm derived from the astrometry of the masers  @xcite is superposed to the figure ( the center of the arm is represented by the solid lines and the width of it by dotted lines ) .    from panel ( a ) it is seen that the map of the median @xmath2  for the young population displays clear declining trend with increasing @xmath0 . as a comparison ,",
    "panel ( b ) shows the map of @xmath2  for the old k - type sgb stars .",
    "it shows a ridge located from ( 8.9,-0.2 ) to ( 8.2,+0.4)kpc with lower @xmath2  of about 220kms@xmath5 . outside the ridge",
    ", @xmath2  increases to around 225kms@xmath5 .",
    "this is substantially different with the velocity gradient for the young stars shown in panel ( a ) .",
    "the pattern of @xmath2  for the old stars seems correlated with the direction of the local arm .",
    "this hints that the velocity pattern may reflect the perturbation induced by the spiral arm .",
    "we then look at the map of @xmath3  for the young population in figure  [ fig : vphi ] ( d ) .",
    "it shows that the young stars move inward with @xmath3@xmath20kms@xmath5  at @xmath21kpc , while their @xmath3  is at around zero at @xmath22kpc .",
    "looking at the map of @xmath3  for the old population in panel ( e ) , we find , roughly , @xmath3  is around @xmath23kms@xmath5  at @xmath22kpc and about zero or even smaller than zero at @xmath21kpc .",
    "the trend of the gradients of @xmath3  for the young and old populations are similar .",
    "however , the values of @xmath3  are different such that the old populations show larger @xmath3 than the young one by around 5kms@xmath5 .",
    "it is noted that the error of @xmath3  for our sample is about 5kms@xmath5 , which leads to the order of @xmath8kms@xmath5  in each @xmath0@xmath1 bin since each bin contains at least 20 stars . because the uncertainty of @xmath3  in each bin is comparable with the local variations in the @xmath3  map , these variations between neighboring bins in panels ( d ) and ( e ) are likely dominated by the statistical fluctuation .",
    "however , the global radial trend displayed in both the young and old populations may not be due to the velocity uncertainties , but is likely a true feature since lots of bins demonstrate this trend together",
    ".    the old stars should be completely relaxed .",
    "hence , the peculiar velocity shown in the old stars is most likely due to the perturbations induced by the spiral arm or the bar . in principle , if the kinematics for the old stars suffers from the perturbations , the young population should be affected in similar way with similar or even more intensive amplitudes because that they are more kinematically cold and thus easier to be perturbed .",
    "therefore , the significant difference in the map of velocities between the young and old populations in panels ( a ) , ( d ) , ( b ) , and ( e ) of figure  [ fig : vphi ] implies that the young stars may be driven by two different mechanisms : 1 ) the perturbations same as those also affecting the old stars and 2 ) a special mechanism plays nothing with the old populations , but only influences the young stars",
    ". then we can remove most of the perturbed velocities due to the first driver by subtracting the maps of velocities for the old stars from those for the young stars in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane .",
    "the residual velocity maps are shown in figure  [ fig : vphi ] ( c ) and ( f ) . in most parts of the @xmath0@xmath1 plane ,",
    "the residual @xmath2  in panel ( c ) is positive from about 10 to 30kms@xmath5 .",
    "the positive residual values can be naturally explained by the different asymmetric drift , which is smaller for the young populations than for the old ones .",
    "the residual @xmath2  also displays a clear gradient from bottom - right to top - left .",
    "the direction of the gradient is approximately parallel with the norm direction of the local arm .",
    "it shows that the young stars move along the azimuthal direction faster in the trailing side of the local arm , while they moves slower by 20kms@xmath5  in the leading side .",
    "the residual @xmath3  in panel ( f ) displays negative values around @xmath4kms@xmath5  with some local variations .",
    "consider the uncertainty of @xmath3  in each bin is around 1kms@xmath5 , the local features with variation of @xmath24kms@xmath5  may be owe to the arbitrary fluctuation .",
    "however , even taking into account the uncertainties , panel ( f ) still shows that , averagely , the @xmath3  of the young population is about @xmath25kms@xmath5  smaller than that of the old one .",
    "to better quantify the kinematical features , we display the two components of the divergence of the in - plane velocity in figure  [ fig : vectors ] .",
    "the top panel shows the map of @xmath26 and the bottom panel shows the map of @xmath27 .",
    "first , the largest values of the divergence occurs in @xmath26 , which varies from + 30kms@xmath5  kpc@xmath5 to -15kms@xmath5  kpc@xmath5 from bottom - right to top - left in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane .",
    "second , the direction of the variation of @xmath26 is roughly along the norm direction of the gas - identified local arm .",
    "finally , @xmath27 is quite flat at around zero , implying that almost no gradient of velocity occurs along @xmath0 .",
    "now consider the continuity equation of fluid mechanics , @xmath28 if the stellar density does not rapidly change with time , then the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : continuity ] ) essentially equals to zero . because figure .",
    "[ fig : vectors ] shows that the divergence of velocity is dominated by @xmath26 and the divergence along @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) direction would only affect the variation of the density along @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) direction , the variation of the stellar density @xmath29 should be also dominated by @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath26 declines from + 30kms@xmath5  kpc@xmath5 to about @xmath31kms@xmath5  kpc@xmath5 , passing through the zero point at the line from ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)@xmath32(8.2 , + 0.3 ) to @xmath32(8.7 , -0.1)kpc .",
    "hence , @xmath30 increases from negative values behind the line ( w.r.t .",
    "the rotation direction ) to positive values in front of the line according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : continuity ] ) .",
    "consequently , the stellar density @xmath29 must increase with @xmath1 starting from the line .",
    "in other word , the young stars are associated with a density wave near the gas - identified local arm .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the motion of the young stars probably reflects the local arm by kinematically associating themselves with a density wave .",
    "this scenario is not conflict with the mean age for the young tracers , which is only @xmath33gyr .",
    "such a time scale is within the expected lifetime of the transient spiral structures  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the distributions of the in - plane velocities displayed in figure  [ fig : vrvphi ] show that , for the young stars ( panel a ) , the velocity distribution forms a tight arc shape .",
    "by contrast , the old stars ( panel b ) show an extended and roughly featureless distribution with a moderate bump at around @xmath3@xmath34kms@xmath5  and @xmath2@xmath35kms@xmath5 , which should be the hercules stream  @xcite . the velocity distribution shown in panel ( a ) can be qualitatively compared with the simulations from  @xcite .",
    "we find that the orientation of the arc similar to our sample is located at the inter - arm regime ( see the panels at the 3rd row and the 2nd , 5th , and 6th columns in their figure 8) , not on the arm , which is consistent with the location of the majority of our samples .",
    "it is noted that , other than the transient spiral mode  @xcite , quite a few works have discussed about the alternative channels of the formation of the spiral structures and some theoretical works have given observational predictions in velocity distributions . particularly about the local arm",
    ", @xcite thought that it may be formed from the perturbation of the giant molecular clouds  @xcite according to their latest maser observations .",
    "and  @xcite found that the local arm , which can sustain over a short time , may not be due to the density wave , but be naturally induced in the scenario such that the disk contains two pairs of prominent spiral structures based on their sph simulations .",
    "we also notice that , recently , @xcite claimed that the fast rotating stars found at the radii a few hundreds parsecs beyond the sun may be driven by the perseus arm other than the local arm",
    ".    the different spiral theories may give different explanations to the peculiar motion of the young stellar populations unveiled in this work .",
    "simply from the observed data , we can not rule out other explanations . further investigations , including more observations in larger volume and well defined n - body simulations , are anxiously required to clarify the nature of the peculiar velocity field for the young stars .",
    "in this letter , we study the in - plane peculiar motions using more than 3000 young stars combined the line - of - sight velocity from the lamost dr3 with the parallax and proper motion from the _ gaia _ dr1 .",
    "the latter provides accurate proper motions with uncertainty of about 1mas yr@xmath5 up to 1kpc in distance , which is the best astrometric measurement so far .",
    "we select the f - type stars as the tracers for the young population and the old k - type sgb stars as the control sample . after removing",
    "the peculiar motions owe to the perturbations , the residual velocity field for the young stars show correlation with the gas - identified local spiral arm .",
    "the @xmath26 map for the young stars implies that the stellar density may increase with @xmath1 starting from the line from ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)@xmath32(8.2 , + 0.3 ) to ( 8.7 , -0.1)kpc .",
    "this hints that the young stars are associated with a density wave located around the local spiral arm .",
    "we then suggest that the young stars are involved in the formation of the local arm by inducing the density wave and hence directly reflects the kinematical features of the arm .",
    "we also note that a few alternative mechanisms to explain such a peculiar velocity field are not simply ruled out .    in future ,",
    "it is worthy to directly compare the peculiar velocity field unveiled by the young stars in this work with various simulations so that the observational evidence can help to distinguish the origin of the spiral structures .",
