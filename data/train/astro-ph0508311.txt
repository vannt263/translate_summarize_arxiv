    "is a nearby ( @xmath9pc ; * ? ? ? * ) complex star forming region .",
    "it hosts an ultracompact ( uc ) hii region near its center , powered by the infrared source . the molecular content of this region has been the subject of several observational studies in the last decade .",
    "so far , it is known a huge co bipolar outflow @xcite , @xmath10 long ( = 3.6pc ) , which is probably a relic of the formation of the b0v star associated to irs1 @xcite .",
    "is an excellent laboratory to learn about the physical conditions and kinematics of an extreme pdr ( g@xmath11 = 5 10@xmath12 in units of habing field , * ? ? ?",
    "continuum observations at 6 cm , reported by @xcite , show that the uc hii region is highly asymmetric , has a cometary shape and reaches its maximum toward its exciting star , .",
    "the cs 7@xmath136 emission map from @xcite shows that the uc hii region is located inside a cavity and bound by a dense molecular ridge ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this picture is consistent with infrared images of the region , which show an almost spherical distribution of hot dust surrounded by the molecular cloud .",
    "the physical and chemical conditions of the pdrs associated to uc hii regions remain not enough known , mainly due to important observational problems : ( a ) these pdrs are too thin to be resolved by single - dish telescopes ; ( b ) they are usually located in very complex star - forming regions , where confusion with the parent molecular cloud , hot cores , and outflows may be considerable .",
    "the study requires specific pdr tracers which allow us to separate their emission from other sources .",
    "reactive ions and small hydrocarbons have been proposed as abundant species , which may trace the hot ionized / molecular gas interface @xcite .",
    "the detection of the reactive ions co@xmath4 and hoc@xmath4 is almost unambiguously associated to regions with a high ionizing flux , either pdrs or xdrs @xcite . in the case of ,",
    "@xcite have recently reported the detection of the reactive ions co@xmath4 and hoc@xmath4 towards the peak of the uc hii region .",
    "in addition to chemical arguments , both the morphology and velocity profile of the lines suggested a link between the hii region and these species .",
    "both ions were detected towards the peak of the uc hii regions and remain undetected in the molecular cloud .",
    "furthermore , the velocity profile of these lines is different from those of other dense gas tracers .",
    "the reactive ions have an intense emission peak at 10.5 km s@xmath14 which is not detected in the other molecules observed .",
    "therefore , the emission of this velocity component may arise in narrow layers of molecular gas surrounding the hii region , where the chemistry is dominated by uv photons .",
    "small hydrocarbons have enhanced abundances in pdrs @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite have detected c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 and c@xmath15h towards the horsehead nebula with an abundance one order of magnitude larger than that predicted by gas - phase pdr models .",
    "this is clearly seen by comparing the [ c - c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[hc@xmath0n ] ratio in pdrs and dark clouds .",
    "while both species have similar abundances in dark clouds , the [ c - c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[hc@xmath0n ] ratio is above 10 in pdrs .",
    "since both molecules are easily destroyed by photodissociation , this suggests the existence of an additional c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 formation mechanism in pdrs .",
    "enhanced abundances of some other compounds have also been related to the presence of intense uv fields into molecular clouds . @xcite",
    "measured a value of [ hco]/[h@xmath2co@xmath4]=9.7 in the region ngc2024 . however , the same authors report values significantly lower than 1 i.e . , an order magnitude below those found in ngc2024 in galactic clouds without developed regions , or having no indication of star formation .",
    "more recently , @xcite have searched for hco in a reduced sample of prototypical pdrs ; the estimated [ hco]/[h@xmath2co@xmath4 ] abundance ratios range from 30 ( in the orion bar ) to 3 ( in ngc7023 ) .",
    "the largest hco abundances are found in the orion bar , the paradigm of interaction between an region ( m42 ) and its parent molecular cloud .",
    "@xcite obtained a high angular resolution image showing widespread hco emission in the external galaxy m82 .",
    "the enhanced hco abundance ( [ hco]/[h@xmath2co@xmath4]@xmath183.6 ) measured across the whole m82 disk was also interpreted in terms of a giant pdr of 650 pc size .",
    "sio is known to be a privileged tracer of large - scale shocks in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "its fractional abundance is enhanced by more than 3 orders of magnitude in shocked regions relative to its abundance in quiescent clouds where it takes values @xmath19 10@xmath20 .",
    "@xcite observed sio towards a sample of pdrs and obtain fractional abundances of @xmath1810@xmath21 in these regions , i.e. , a factor of 10 larger than that in dark clouds .    in this paper , we present observations of a selected set of molecular species ( c@xmath1h , c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 , hc@xmath0n , h@xmath2co@xmath4 , hco , and sio ) which are thought to be good probes of the different layers of the molecular gas in pdrs . in this way",
    ", we have performed a study of the physical conditions , the chemistry , and the kinematics of the molecular gas surrounding the uc hii region .",
    "the observations were carried out using the iram 30 m radio telescope in pico de veleta ( spain ) during july 2002 and august 2003 .",
    "the multi - receiver capability of the telescope was used for these observations .",
    "the observed rotational transitions , frequencies , beam sizes , and main - beam efficiencies are shown in table 1 .",
    "the backends used for the observations were an autocorrelator split in several parts , a 256 @xmath22 100 khz and two 512 @xmath22 1 mhz filter - banks .",
    "all the lines but h@xmath2co@xmath4 1@xmath130 and c@xmath0h@xmath1  5(1,4)@xmath134(2,3 ) have been measured with two spectral resolutions , namely the lower spectral resolution provided by the 1 mhz filter - bank and the higher one , 78 khz100 khz , provided by the autocorrelator and the 100 khz filter bank .",
    "the h@xmath2co@xmath4 1@xmath130 and c@xmath0h@xmath1  5(1,4)@xmath134(2,3 ) lines have only been measured with the 1 mhz filter - bank , providing the lower spectral resolution . the c@xmath0h@xmath1  6(1,6 ) @xmath135(0,5 ) [ ortho ] and 6(0,6)@xmath135(1,5 ) [ para ] are blended .",
    "the observational strategy was as follows .",
    "we have mapped the uc region and its surroundings in millimeter transitions of h@xmath2co@xmath4 , hc@xmath0n , hco , and sio .",
    "the c@xmath1h and c@xmath0h@xmath1  transitions were observed along a strip transversal to the uc region , at an inclination angle ( east to north ) of 135 , which is approximately the symmetry axis of .",
    "the mapped area ( @xmath23 ) and strip positions are sketched in fig .  1 , overlaid on the cs 7@xmath136 map of @xcite and the 6 cm - continuum map of @xcite .",
    "the relative offsets are referred to , ( ra , dec.)@xmath24=(@xmath25 ) .",
    "longer integration time was devoted to observe two particular positions : the maximum of the continuum emission , at ( 0 , 0 ) , and the maximum of the molecular envelope , at ( + 10 , -10 ) .",
    "these two positions were also observed in the reactive ions co@xmath4 and hoc@xmath4 , and already published in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "the small hydrocarbons c@xmath1h  and c@xmath0h@xmath1  have been observed along a strip crossing the ionization bar in .",
    "after the hyperfine - structure analysis which compares the relative intensities of each component , we have found that the c@xmath1h  triplet emission at 87.3 ghz is optically thin at all positions .",
    "based on this result , we will deal in the following just with the most intense hyperfine component ( @xmath26 ) , referring to this as `` the c@xmath1h  1@xmath130 line '' .",
    "some of the c@xmath1h  and c@xmath0h@xmath1  observed spectra are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the gaussian fits to a single component are also shown in table 2 for all the lines .",
    "the c@xmath1h 1@xmath130 line shows emission at high velocities ( @xmath27  @xmath28 kms@xmath14 and @xmath27  @xmath29 kms@xmath14 ) that is not detected ( or only marginally detected ) in the c@xmath0h@xmath1 lines .",
    "these velocity ranges coincide with those of the red - shifted and blue - shifted emission in the large - scale , now inactive , outflow associated with irs 1 @xcite .",
    "we have not detected emission at high velocity in any other of the pdr tracers studied in this paper and @xcite .",
    "thus , we consider that the high velocity c@xmath1h emission is not related to the uc region but to the low density gas that share the kinematics of the large - scale outflow . since we are mainly interested in the study of the pdr surrounding the uc region , we have only used the c@xmath1h emission in the range 812 kms@xmath14 in our calculations .    within the considered velocity range ,",
    "the velocities and spatial distribution of the c@xmath1h 1@xmath130 and c@xmath0h@xmath1 2@xmath131 lines are remarkable similar , which suggest that both lines trace essentially the same region .",
    "however , the emission of the c@xmath0h@xmath1 2@xmath131 and the c@xmath0h@xmath1 6@xmath135 lines have different kinematics and spatial distribution , which became eloquent when looking at the central velocities in table 2 and the shaded areas in fig .  2 . the c@xmath0h@xmath1 2@xmath131 line is narrower than the 6@xmath135 line along the whole strip . furthermore , the central velocity of the 2@xmath131 line is lower than that of the 6@xmath135 line towards the uc region . when looking at the areas , it is remarkable the different spatial distribution of the 2@xmath131 and 6@xmath135 lines .",
    "the 2@xmath131 emission ( a low excitation line ) is clearly lower at the central part of the strip , while the 6@xmath135 emission ( a high excitation line ) is particularly intense there .",
    "this behavior is better explained by assuming the existence of _ at least _ two gas components characterized by different velocities . the blue velocity component ( hereafter referred to as c1 ) , emitting at velocities from @xmath30 8 to 10 km s@xmath14 ,",
    "is dominated by the emission of the 2@xmath131 line along the whole strip , but it is not particularly intense in the 6@xmath135 line .",
    "this component remains quite uniform along the strip .",
    "the red velocity component , with emission from @xmath30 10 to 12 km s@xmath14and hereafter referred to as c2 , has intense emission in the 6@xmath135 line but it is very weak in the 2@xmath131 line .",
    "c2 is especially intense towards the inner region .",
    "the distribution of both components can be interpreted as c1 associated with the foreground molecular cloud and c2 associated with the region , or the interface between it and the molecular cloud .",
    "this trend is illustrated in fig .  3 , where we plot the integrated intensity of the c@xmath0h@xmath1  6@xmath135 line ( fig .",
    "3a ) and the 6@xmath135/2@xmath131 line intensity ratio ( hereafter referred to as r@xmath31 ) for each component ( fig .",
    "r@xmath31 remains quite constant and @xmath18 1 for c1 along the strip .",
    "however , it has significant variations in c2 .",
    "the values of r@xmath31 are @xmath32 outside the uc region and @xmath33 towards the inner region .",
    "the fig .",
    "3b clearly separates both components , and shows that c2 is tracing highly excited molecular gas , linked to the uc region .",
    "this splitting of the values of r@xmath31 is also in agreement with the spatial distribution of both components .",
    "of course , the different beams involved in both lines affect the computation of r@xmath31 .",
    "we could estimate the beam dilution by convolving the c@xmath0h@xmath1  6@xmath135 emission of the c2 down to the angular resolution of the 2@xmath131 line .",
    "this one - dimensional smoothing was performed along the symmetry axis , which shows the largest variations in other molecular tracers .",
    "the results are shown by dashed lines in fig .",
    "3 . as expected , the distribution of the 6@xmath135 line intensity peaks in the southeastern border of the uc region .",
    "furthermore , it is remarkable that r@xmath31 remains @xmath34 in the three central positions . in other words ,",
    "the high value of r@xmath31 there , even smoothed , strengthens the mutual relationship between c2 and the uc region .",
    "we have mapped the region indicated in fig .  1 in several rotational lines .",
    "4 shows the resultant maps in h@xmath2co@xmath4 1@xmath130 ( fig .",
    "4a ) , sio 2@xmath131(fig .",
    "4b ) , hco 1@xmath130 ( fig .",
    "4c ) , and hc@xmath0n 10@xmath139 ( fig .  4d ) .",
    "superimposed are the 6 cm - continuum emission from @xcite .",
    "all the maps were constructed by integrating the lines along the total velocity range of emission .",
    "we note remarkable differences in the distribution of the different species .",
    "the h@xmath2co@xmath4 and the hc@xmath0n emission clearly follow the high density gas , properly traced by the cs 7@xmath136 emission ( see fig",
    ".  1 ) and reach a minimum toward the center of the uc region .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of h@xmath2co@xmath4 and hc@xmath0n as being photodissociated within the uc region .",
    "however , the other molecules present different behaviors . the sio and hco emissions seem to be located preferably at intermediate positions between the molecular envelope and the region .",
    "although this effect should be regarded as tentative , because the spatial difference between the continuum peak and the sio distribution is about half a beam , the systematic difference looks evident , and clearly the sio or hco maps are different to those of h@xmath2co@xmath4 or hc@xmath0n .",
    "this result is in line with @xcite , who also found moderately enhanced sio and hco emissions close to the ionization front in the prototypical region m42 .",
    "however , the two species peak at different positions .",
    "the hco maxima appears almost exactly at the sio minimum , and both emissions completely bound the inner uc region .    in fig .",
    "5 we show all the spectra we have observed towards the ( 0,0 ) position ( this paper and * ? ? ?",
    "the dashed vertical line traces the limits of c1 and c2 .",
    "unfortunately , some of the lines at ( 0,0 ) are rather weak , which yields a low s / n ratio . even though , a quick look suggests the existence of two different behaviors in the shape of the observed lines .",
    "a first group of lines has the maximum intensity at velocities @xmath35 10 km s@xmath14 , close to the c1 velocity ; this is the case for the sio and hco lines . a second group peaks at velocities @xmath36 km s@xmath14 and are especially intense in c2 ; the c@xmath0h@xmath1 6@xmath135 , co@xmath4 2@xmath131 and hoc@xmath4 1@xmath130 belongs to this group .",
    "the strong difference between the sio lines at c2 velocities should be more carefully analyzed in future observations .",
    "after a joint view of the maps ( fig .  4 ) and the spectra ( fig .  5 ) , we see that the sio and hco emitting gas do not seem to share the same volume with the reactive ions and small hydrocarbons , but to arise in a more shielded layer of the pdr , which is preferably at the velocity of c1 . as further discussed in sects .  5 and 6 ,",
    "different excitation conditions and chemistry are associated to this shielded layer and c2 .",
    "we have developed a lvg code to estimate the main physical parameters of the c@xmath0h@xmath1  molecule .",
    "the einstein a- coefficients have been taken from @xcite .",
    "the collisional rates are from @xcite , who provided values for kinetic temperatures ( @xmath37 ) of 30 , 60 , 90 , and 120k .",
    "our lvg code treats the ortho- and para - c@xmath0h@xmath1 as different species . in most positions ,",
    "we have detected only the 2(1,2)@xmath131(0,1 ) [ ortho ] and the 6@xmath135 ( a blending of the 6(1,6)@xmath135(0,5 ) [ ortho ] and 6(0,6)@xmath135(1,5 ) [ para ] ) lines .",
    "then , we need to assume a value of the c@xmath0h@xmath1 ortho - to - para ratio ( otpr ) in our calculations . in order to have an estimate of the otpr ,",
    "we have used the 6@xmath135/5@xmath134 line intensity ratio ( hereafter r@xmath38 ) towards the ( 0@xmath39,0@xmath39 ) and ( @xmath40,@xmath41 ) positions .",
    "the observed value , r@xmath42 , is compatible with r@xmath43 , which is expected for the standard value of 3 .",
    "therefore , we have assumed otpr=3 in our lvg calculations hereafter .",
    "the lvg code was run for different sets of @xmath37 , from 10 to 150k .",
    "for @xmath37different to those tabulated by @xcite , we have interpolated or extrapolated between the two closest temperatures . a minimum value of 30 k for @xmath37  is needed to reproduce the 6@xmath135/2@xmath131 line ratio ( hereafter referred to as r@xmath31 ) both in c1 and c2 . for @xmath37@xmath44k",
    ", r@xmath31 is weakly dependent on the assumed kinetic temperature and traces mainly the hydrogen density . in table 3",
    ", we show the lvg results assuming @xmath37@xmath45k , the kinetic temperature derived by @xcite from multiline molecular observations .",
    "we have obtained rather uniform values of both the molecular density ( @xmath46(h@xmath1 ) ) and the c@xmath0h@xmath1  column density ( @xmath47(c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) ) in c1 across the observed strip .",
    "the derived @xmath46(h@xmath1 ) is around 5@xmath48 @xmath8 , in agreement with results derived from other tracers @xcite , and the @xmath47(c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) are in the range 13@xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "a different behavior is observed in c2 .",
    "the c2 hydrogen density increases from a few 10@xmath12 @xmath8 outside the uc region to @xmath7 @xmath8 in the three central positions .",
    "this limit is almost insensitive to @xmath37  in the range 50 to 150k .",
    "thus , the larger values of the r@xmath31 observed towards the region can not be due to a higher kinetic temperature .",
    "the fig .",
    "6 shows the lvg results from two of the runs , corresponding to values of @xmath37  of 60 and 120k .",
    "the shadowed areas indicate the range of observed values towards the ( @xmath51,@xmath51 ) position . while @xmath47(c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) is similar in c1 and c2 , the c2 density is a factor @xmath52 greater than in c1 .",
    "recent results of @xcite and near - ir images show a shell - like structure , intense in mid- and near - ir , of a few arcsec width , wrapping up the uc region .",
    "it is indeed possible that c2 is tracing the _ high density molecular gas _ associated to this feature .",
    "this would also explain the spatial distribution of @xmath47(c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) in c2 which slightly increases towards the border of the region , the expected behavior of a molecular shell surrounding the ionized gas .",
    "we have estimated the c@xmath1h column density ( @xmath47(c@xmath1h ) ) across the studied strip using the lvg code and assuming @xmath46(h@xmath1)=10@xmath53 @xmath8 and @xmath37=50k .",
    "we have adopted the cross sections provided by @xcite for the hcn molecule , and then used the ios ( infinite - order sudden ) approximation for molecular collision dynamics to get the collisional coefficients between different levels . a similar procedure was followed by @xcite , who also provided the einstein a- coefficients for c@xmath1h .",
    "the c1 and c2 components have been separated towards the ( 0@xmath39,0@xmath39 ) and ( @xmath40,@xmath41 ) .",
    "most of the c@xmath1h  emission seem to be associated to c1 outwards these positions .",
    "the results are shown in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "@xmath47(c@xmath1h ) varies from 2 to 4 10@xmath54 @xmath50 , decreasing toward the center of the region , as expected in a region where the molecules are photodestroyed by a high incident uv flux .",
    "when compared to c@xmath0h@xmath1 , the [ c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c@xmath1h ] ratio slightly increases towards the center ; an exception is the last point of the strip , which has a considerable lower s / n ratio ( see table 3 ) .",
    "comparing both components , the [ c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c@xmath1h ] ratio is three times greater in c2 than in c1 ( see table 4 ) . as we will refer in sect .",
    "6.1 , the significantly larger [ c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c@xmath1h ] ratio in c2 reveals that the chemistry of the molecular gas is heavily affected by the uv radiation .",
    "the h@xmath2co@xmath4 , sio and hc@xmath0n column densities have been estimated using an lvg code and assuming @xmath37=50k and @xmath46(h@xmath1)=10@xmath53@xmath8 . under these physical conditions , the excitation temperature of the h@xmath2co@xmath4 1@xmath130 line is @xmath1820k .",
    "we have also derived the hco column density by assuming optically thin emission , lte conditions and a rotation temperature of 20k .",
    "the uncertainty in the excitation temperature of hco should not affect the fractional abundances of these molecules .",
    "the results for some selected positions are shown in table 5 .",
    "significant changes in the fractional abundances are detected across the uc region .",
    "in particular , the hc@xmath0n abundance decreases by a factor of @xmath183 towards the uc region ( x(hc@xmath0n@xmath55 a few 10@xmath56 ) , when compared towards the dense molecular cloud ( where x(hc@xmath0n ) @xmath18 10@xmath57 ) .",
    "this decrease of the hc@xmath0n abundance in regions of enhanced uv field has also been found in other regions like the prototypical pdr of the orion bar @xcite , or the starburst galaxy m82 @xcite , and it is easily explained by photodissociation .",
    "sio has a different behavior .",
    "the sio abundance is low towards the center of the uc region ( x(sio)@xmath5810@xmath20 ) .",
    "it is also low towards the dense molecular cloud , where we derive x(sio)@xmath5910@xmath20 , in agreement with the values of the sio abundance measured in dark clouds .",
    "however , it is one order of magnitude higher at intermediate positions between the uc region and the molecular cloud ; here , the sio abundance is comparable to that found by @xcite towards the pdrs associated with the orion bar and s140 .    similarly to sio",
    ", the hco abundance is also enhanced at the border of the uc region .",
    "in particular the [ hco]/[h@xmath2co@xmath4 ] ratio is 10 times larger in the position ( 0,24 ) than in the center of the uc region and in the dense molecular cloud .",
    "we have measured a hco abundance as high as @xmath60 towards the hco peak .",
    "such large values of the hco abundance have been found at the border of the region ngc 2024 by @xcite and in the orion bar by @xcite , suggesting that this molecule is specially abundant in the pdrs formed at the edges of the regions .",
    "@xcite found large values of the hco abundance in the starburst galaxy m82 , where a low - density ionized component is filling a substantial fraction of its volume ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our data show the existence of a high - density layer of gas associated to the uc region in .",
    "this layer is traced by c2 and seems to have different physical conditions from that of c1 and the molecular cloud .",
    "furthermore , a different chemistry may also carry out in the layer traced by c2 . in order to explore this idea ,",
    "we have computed the column densities and fractional abundances for the two components , towards the positions ( + 10,-10 ) and ( 0,0 ) , and for the molecules studied in this paper and @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in table 4 .",
    "significant differences exist between the [ co@xmath4]/[hco@xmath4 ] , [ hco@xmath4]/[hoc@xmath4 ] and [ c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c@xmath1h ] ratios between c1 and c2 . in order to characterize the chemistry of the two components ,",
    "we have modeled the pdr using the plane - parallel model developed by le bourlot and collaborators @xcite with an uv field g@xmath61 in units of the habing field and a total density ( _ i.e. _  atomic plus molecular ) of 210@xmath53 @xmath8 ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  and this paper ) .",
    "the main results are sketched in fig .",
    "the molecules co@xmath4 , hoc@xmath4 , c@xmath1h , and c@xmath0h@xmath1 are known to be good tracers of the surface layers ( @xmath62mag ) of the pdrs ( see e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "these environments are highly exposed to an intense uv field , and hence we will refer to these molecules as `` _ high uv _ '' species ( huv for briefing ) .",
    "in particular , the reactive ion co@xmath4 is only expected to reach significant abundances at a visual extinction , @xmath63mag @xcite . in fig .",
    "7a we show the co@xmath4 and hco@xmath4 fractional abundances as a function of the visual extinction for our model . as expected , the abundance of co@xmath4 is only significant at @xmath63mag , and just at this low visual extinction , the predicted [ co@xmath4]/[hco@xmath4 ] ratio agrees with that measured in c2 towards the region ( light gray region in fig .",
    "the [ co@xmath4]/[hco@xmath4 ] ratio is more than one order of magnitude greater in c2 than in c1 ( table 4 ) , which indicates that c1 arise in a more shielded layer of the molecular gas having @xmath64mag ( dark gray region in fig .",
    "the [ hco@xmath4]/[hoc@xmath4 ] ratio is a factor of 2 lower in c2 than in c1 .",
    "low values of the [ hco@xmath4]/[hoc@xmath4 ] ratio are associated to highly ionized regions @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the reactive ion hoc@xmath4 is not included in le bourlot s model , but we can estimate its abundance in an indirect way .",

    ", it is required an electron abundance , x(e@xmath66)@xmath67 @xcite . using our model ,",
    "we conclude that these high electron abundances are only reached at @xmath68mag .",
    "thus , the [ co@xmath4]/hco@xmath4 ] and the [ hco@xmath4]/[hoc@xmath4 ] ratios support the interpretation of c2 as arising from a layer of molecular gas located at a visual extinction @xmath69mag from the advancing ionization front .",
    "a new pdr model including reactions of hoc@xmath4 is under development , and it will directly predict the [ hco@xmath4]/[hoc@xmath4 ] ratio , as a function of global physical conditions ( uv field , density , extinction ) in a near future .",
    "the [ c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c@xmath1h ] ratio also changes between c1 and c2 .",
    "in fact , this is a factor of 23 larger in c2 than in c1 .",
    "our chemical model predicts that the [ c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c@xmath1h ] ratio is maximum at a visual extinction between 2 and 4mag ( see fig .",
    "these values of the visual extinction are in agreement with those derived from the measured [ hco@xmath4]/[hoc@xmath4 ] ratio .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable that the emission of c2 arises in the same layer of dense gas than hoc@xmath4 ( @xmath68mag ) , while co@xmath4 arises in even a more external layer ( @xmath63mag ) .",
    "however , our model fails to predict values of [ c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c@xmath1h ] as large as those measured in c2 even at this low visual extinction .",
    "the maximum value of the [ c@xmath0h@xmath1]/[c@xmath1h ] ratio predicted by the model is @xmath18 0.01 , three times lower than those measured in c2 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "7b and table 4 ) .",
    "a failure of pdr models to account for the observed c@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance has already been commented in previous works @xcite . the existence of an additional formation mechanism for c@xmath0h@xmath1 linked to the pahs photodestruction has been proposed as an alternative to account the large c@xmath0h@xmath1 fractional abundances in pdrs .    summarizing",
    ", we can infer from the comparison of our observations of huv molecules and model calculations that c2 is tracing the dense molecular gas located at a visual extinction @xmath69mag from the ionization front , while c1 is mainly tracing the more shielded part ( @xmath6mag ) of the pdr .",
    "consequently , the uc region is surrounding by a thin layer ( @xmath70 @xmath50 ) of dense ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) molecular gas , whose chemistry is heavily affected by the uv stellar radiation and kinetically well represented by c2 .",
    "in contrast to the huv species , the column densities of hco and sio decrease towards the uc region , as expected in this harsh environment .",
    "furthermore , their abundances are larger in c1 than in c2 ( see [ hco]/[h@xmath2co@xmath4 ] and [ sio]/[h@xmath2co@xmath4 ] in table 4 ) , and show an enhancement at its edges ( see table 5 ) .",
    "clearly , both hco and sio do not share a behavior similar to the huv molecules ; moreover , they are not particularly abundant in the cold envelope .",
    "both molecules seem to be mainly present in the shielded parts of the pdr ( @xmath6mag ) , and would belong to a family of species which can survive in those environments , less exposed to the uv field than the huv molecules .",
    "we hereafter call such molecules as `` _ low uv _ '' ( or luv for briefing ) species .",
    "the abundance of our luv molecules are unusually high and could not be explained by gas - phase models ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "equally puzzling is the fact that both molecules peak at different positions .",
    "as we have already stated before , both sio and hco have near their maxima abundances comparable to other pdrs , such as and orion bar @xcite .",
    "moreover , the [ hco]/[h@xmath2co@xmath4 ] abundance ratio near the hco peak is in the range 1015 , higher than in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this enhancement can be due to a few reasons .",
    "firstly , some relevant chemical reactions leading to formation of sio and hco might not be considered in gas - phase models .",
    "it was already analyzed by several authors ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and sounds rather unlikely . even though , we should not disregard the hypothesis , mainly due to a possible lack of complete chemical networks and rate coefficients .",
    "so far , the most widely accepted alternative explanation arises by considering the grain chemistry . as many authors pointed out ( see , for example , the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the dust plays a key role in driving the chemistry and the energetics in pdrs . @xcite",
    "have modeled the si chemistry in pdrs , and found that most of si is in solid form at extinctions greater than 3 mag .",
    "this issue was observationally confirmed by @xcite in , where a special distribution and enhancement of sio was detected .",
    "@xcite have included photodesorption of si in their pdr model .",
    "sio would later be produced in gaseous phase by reactions with oh and o@xmath1 . by doing so",
    ", those authors could account for the observed sio abundance in and .",
    "laboratory measurements of the rate coefficient of the reaction si + o@xmath1 @xmath13 sio + o @xcite , followed by detailed calculations of si chemistry , have confirmed the results by @xcite .    in the case of hco ,",
    "the photodesorption of h@xmath1co followed by its photodissociation in gaseous phase have been claimed as a mechanism capable to counterbalance the photodissociation of hco against the uv photons @xcite .",
    "the authors could get an enhancement of hco ( at @xmath6 mag ) but not to the observed levels .",
    "this may be due to the need of more reliable rates for the processes involved , but also to the reduced network used in the gas - phase formation of this low - abundance species .",
    "we have measured similar abundances of hco and hence are in a similar situation ; the uv field intensity , greater in than in orion bar @xcite , does not seem to affect the hco abundance .",
    "however , photodesorption may not efficiently work in some other environments . @xcite",
    "have modeled both gas- and dust - chemistry in quiescent cores , and shown that the abundance of some species with lower binding energies than si do not significantly change when including photodesorption .",
    "the modeled quiescent cores , however , have a @xmath71 ratio at least two orders of magnitude lower than in , because the densities are two orders of magnitude lower , and the incident uv field takes interstellar values .",
    "even though , their results should be taken into account , and a complete model like the @xcite s one , under physical conditions more typical of pdrs , will surely improve our knowledge about the particular chemistry of luv species and pdrs in general . anyway ,",
    "if sio and hco are formed after photodesorption of si and h@xmath1co , respectively , we would expect other atoms and molecules do so , and would be detectable . at this respect , an interesting test may be to carry out an observational campaign to search for and study other luv species throughout the whole field . a good candidate to belong to the luv group in nh@xmath0 , a widely recognized species linked to grain chemistry ,",
    "whose abundance close to the borders of regions is enhanced @xcite .",
    "the different spatial distributions of our luv molecules is another interesting issue .",
    "both molecules almost complete a `` ring '' between the uc region and the molecular envelope .",
    "however , they peak at different locations throughout the ring : while sio arises in the densest part of the ionization front , hco peaks in the tail of the cometary shape .",
    "different local conditions should exist in order to explain the variations in relative abundances of sio and hco .",
    "a rather simple explanation is that hco and sio have a different desorption yield ; in this case one would expect a layered structure in the morphology of these molecules .",
    "unfortunately , the low angular resolution of the hco and sio maps prevent us from concluding about that .",
    "a second possibility is that a low - velocity shock associated with the ionization front contributes to enhance the hco and/or sio abundances . in the case of hot cores ,",
    "this process was already analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the low velocity shocks contribute to release si and/or h@xmath1co from the grain surfaces , and the gas phase chemistry is modified by the advancing shock front .",
    "the radical hco is rapidly destroyed by o , but in shocked regions the o abundance is reduced because it is converted to h@xmath1o .",
    "furthermore , sio is efficiently formed by the reaction si @xmath72 oh @xmath13 sio @xmath72 h , being oh the photodissociation product of h@xmath1o . thus , the hco and sio abundances are very sensitive to the o / oh / h@xmath1o relative fractional abundances and can change locally because of low velocity shocks and small inhomogeneities in the incident uv field . finally , a variation in the grain composition may account for the differences between the hco - peak to the sio - peak .",
    "observations of dust emission may help to solve this interesting puzzle in .",
    "@xcite have studied this region in the mid - ir , from 8.2 to 20.6@xmath73 m . besides the ir sources ,",
    "continuum dust emission is dominated by a ring - like structure which roughly bounds the ionized region .",
    "while the dust temperature is rather uniform in the area ( 100115k ) , the opacity is greater in the ring .",
    "@xcite also studied the silicate absorption feature at 10@xmath73 m , and found a patchy distribution , not necessarily correlated to the point sources , the temperature , or the opacity .",
    "so far , dust properties may significantly change in areas as small as a few arcsec , although this result encourages one of our alternatives ( variation in grain composition ) , the distribution of hco and sio is still an open subject because the other proposed explanations ( different desorption yield and low - velocity shocks ) may be working in this case .    to summarize ,",
    "our sio and hco observations show that these compounds are enhanced in the outskirts of the uc regions ( @xmath6mag ) .",
    "the enhancement in the abundance of these species may be related to the interaction of the uv photons with grains , instead of the direct effect of the uv photons on the molecular gas chemistry .",
    "the interaction of the uv photons with grains may modify the chemistry of large column densities of the molecular gas , and may show an evidence of the advancing pdr into the molecular cloud .",
    "in the uc regions , the high densities of the ionized gas lead to enormous internal pressures ( @xmath74 @xmath8 k ) . since the sources are very small , their expansion timescales should be as short as a few hundred years @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the number of uc regions is greater than the expected from the massive star formation rate @xcite , which is known as the `` lifetime problem '' of the uc regions",
    ". a deep knowledge of the morphology and physical conditions of the dense pdr around the uc region in , would shed some light on this problem .",
    "we can explore one of the proposed explanations , in which the extremely dense neutral gas confine the hii region by pressure @xcite ; our data show the existence of a gas layer with @xmath46(h@xmath1)@xmath7 @xmath8 . hence ,",
    "if we assume a kinetic temperature of 100k , a hydrogen density @xmath46(h@xmath1 ) @xmath75 @xmath8 would be enough to pressure - confine the uc region .",
    "the velocity range associated to c2 is undoubtedly different from that linked to the parent molecular cloud , and hence it should have a particular kinematics . by means of the pdr chemistry , we have a good chance of further studying the kinematics of the molecular gas confining the uc region , because some chemical species may avoid the confusion of the foreground molecular cloud . in fig .  8",
    ", we show the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram of the c@xmath0h@xmath1 2@xmath131 ( fig .",
    "8a ) and 6@xmath135 lines ( fig .",
    "8b ) across the observed strip .",
    "as we previously discussed , most of the c@xmath0h@xmath1 2@xmath131 line traces c1 , whereas the 6@xmath135 emission is dominated by c2 .",
    "the p - v diagram of the c@xmath0h@xmath1 6@xmath135 line is preferably located toward the region ( center of the map ) , rather than extended along the whole strip .",
    "the curves superimposed in fig .  8 were symmetrically traced around c1 , and roughly follow the c@xmath0h@xmath1  6@xmath135 maxima . as the extreme velocities of the curves are @xmath76 and 12 km s@xmath14 , this pattern is compatible with a picture where the pdr is expanding at a velocity between 2 and 3 km s@xmath14 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that such a low expansion velocity was recently observed in an uc region in w48 , by observations of carbon recombination lines @xcite .",
    "we have carried out a molecular survey towards the uc region to have a deeper insight into the chemistry associated to this kind of objects .",
    "our results show the existence of two groups of molecules . the first group ( huv ) is formed by molecules that present large abundances in the surface layers of pdrs ( @xmath62mag ) .",
    "the species co@xmath4 , hoc@xmath4 , c@xmath1h , and c@xmath0h@xmath1 belong to this group .",
    "gas - phase pdr models can successfully account for the behavior of co@xmath4 , hoc@xmath4 , and c@xmath1h . in the case of c@xmath0h@xmath1 , however , pdr models fall short of explaining the observed abundances .",
    "new c@xmath0h@xmath1 formation mechanisms linked to the photodestruction of pahs have been proposed to account for this difference .",
    "hco and sio belong to another group of molecules ( luv ) .",
    "their abundances are enhanced at the edges of the pdr ( @xmath6mag ) , which can not be explained by current gas - phase pdr models .",
    "photodesorption from grain mantles appears like a probable mechanism capable of explaining the observed abundances .",
    "a revision of gas - phase chemical networks , as well as a model able to include photodesorption in pdrs , may significantly improve the knowledge of luv species .",
    "other molecules , like nh@xmath0 , whose chemistry is related with the grains also present large abundances at the edges of the regions @xcite .",
    "this issue may show that the interactions of the uv radiation with the grains could produce important effects on the chemistry of the molecular gas , even at local visual extinction as deep as 10mag .",
    "finally , we have used pdr chemistry to determine the physical conditions and kinematics of the layer of gas surrounding the uc region . using a lvg code to fit our c@xmath0h@xmath1 observations , we have derived hydrogen densities @xmath7 @xmath8 for this layer .",
    "the proposed scenario of a pressure - confined region requires @xmath46(h@xmath1 ) @xmath77 @xmath8 , perfectly compatible with this result .",
    "in addition , the p - v diagram of the c@xmath0h@xmath1 lines might show that while the gas layers at a visual extinction @xmath78mag are expanding at a velocity of @xmath18 23 km s@xmath14 , the back layers of the pdr are moving at the velocities of the foreground molecular cloud .",
    "this kinematics supports the interpretation that the uc region could be confined by a dense ( @xmath46(h@xmath1 ) @xmath79 @xmath8 ) and thin ( @xmath69 10@xmath80 @xmath50 ) layer of neutral gas .    on the other hand",
    ", the search for other luv molecules looks as an exciting observational task which may lead to determine the chemical processes carrying out in the more shielded part of pdrs .",
    "moreover , further observations and multi - transitional studies of the huv molecules are needed to determine accurately the physical conditions and dynamics of this neutral layer .",

    "<S> these data , together with the reactive ions recently detected , have been considered to determine the physical conditions and to model the pdr chemistry . </S>",
    "<S> we then identified two kind of molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the first group , formed by the reactive ions ( co@xmath4 , hoc@xmath4 ) and small hydrocarbons ( c@xmath1h , c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) , traces the surface layers of the pdr and is presumably exposed to a high uv field ( hence we called it as `` _ high uv _ '' , or huv ) . </S>",
    "<S> huv species is expected to dominate for visual absorptions @xmath5mag . </S>",
    "<S> a second group ( less exposed to the uv field , and hence called `` _ low uv _ '' , or luv ) includes hco and sio , and is mainly present at the edges of the pdr ( @xmath6mag ) . </S>",
    "<S> while the abundances of the huv molecules can be explained by gas phase models , this is not the case for the studied luv ones . </S>",
    "<S> although some efficient gas - phase reactions might be lacking , grain chemistry sounds like a probable mechanism able to explain the observed enhancement of hco and sio . within this scenario </S>",
    "<S> , the interaction of uv photons with grains produces an important effect on the molecular gas chemistry and constitutes the first evidence of an ionization front created by the uc region carving its host molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the physical conditions and kinematics of the gas layer which surrounds the uc region were derived from the huv molecules . </S>",
    "<S> molecular hydrogen densities @xmath7 @xmath8 are required to reproduce the observations . </S>",
    "<S> such high densities suggest that the region could be pressure - confined by the surrounding high density molecular gas . </S>"
