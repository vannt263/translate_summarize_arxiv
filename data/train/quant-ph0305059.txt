    "entropy plays a significant role in both classical and quantum information theories and is characterised by various measures , including the shannon entropy in classical information theory and the von neumann entropy for a density operator of a quantum system .",
    "these entropy measures are related , because the von neumann entropy of a density operator equals the shannon entropy of the eigenvalues of this operator .",
    "the von neumann and shannon entropies are the standard entropy measures , but other entropy measures are also employed .    for quantum systems , the linear entropy is widely employed .",
    "the linear entropy is easier to calculate than the von neumann entropy in general , hence its appeal .",
    "other entropy measures are also employed , including the tsallis entropy @xcite and the @xmath0 , or rnyi , entropy @xcite .",
    "a common way of describing these entropy measures is via the trace over a concave function of the density operator .",
    "this general entropy measure has been widely studied both in the context of classical probability distributions and mixed quantum states @xcite .",
    "this work is motivated by problems where one entropy measure is required , but it is only possible to obtain analytic results for another entropy measure .",
    "however , the exact result for the desired entropy measure may not be required . driven by this motivation ,",
    "we establish a method by which one entropy measure can be estimated from another entropy measure that may be easier to calculate .",
    "specific examples of this problem have been considered in @xcite ; here we derive the general result for general entropy measures in both the classical and quantum contexts .",
    "general entropy measures for classical information and for quantum information are discussed in section [ sec : general ] . in section [ sec : bounds ] , we show that the states and probability distributions given in @xcite extremise ( minimise or maximise ) general entropy measures for a given value of another generalised entropy provided that a concavity / convexity condition is satisfied . in section [ sec : apply ] , we apply our methods to particular examples and provide an example of an entropy measure that violates the concavity / convexity condition .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "three common measures of quantum entropy are the von neumann , linear and rnyi entropies .",
    "the von neumann entropy for density operator @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 , where the notation @xmath3 is used for logarithms base @xmath4 .",
    "the linear entropy is defined by @xmath5 , and the @xmath0 or rnyi entropy @xcite by @xmath6 these three entropy measures are all calculated from an expression of the form @xmath7 .    in order to derive general results , we therefore consider general entropy measures of the form @xcite @xmath8 the function @xmath9 is a mapping @xmath10\\mapsto\\mathbb{r}$ ] , and @xmath11 is the corresponding operator function defined by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the eigenvalues and eigenstates , respectively , of @xmath1 , and @xmath15 is the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "the entropy measure @xmath16 therefore only depends on the eigenvalues of the density matrix , and may be calculated as @xmath17 .",
    "we require that the function @xmath9 satisfies the following three conditions : +   + _ condition 1 _ : @xmath18 . + _ condition 2 _ : the function @xmath9 is strictly concave or strictly convex .",
    "+ _ condition 3 _ : the first derivative @xmath19 exists and is continuous in the interval @xmath20 .",
    "+ all the examples of entropy measures above satisfy these three conditions .",
    "the first condition allows us to embed the hilbert space in another of larger dimension without changing the value obtained for @xmath16 .",
    "the second condition implies that the extremal values of the entropy are obtained for pure and maximally mixed states .",
    "this result follows from the following lemma :   + * lemma 1 . * _ let @xmath21\\to\\mathbb{r}$ ] be a function such that @xmath18 , and let @xmath22 be a set of @xmath15 non - negative real numbers such that @xmath23 . if @xmath9 is concave ( convex ) , then the minimum ( maximum ) value of @xmath24 is obtained for one of the @xmath13 equal to @xmath25 and the rest zero , and the maximum ( minimum ) value of @xmath24 is obtained for all @xmath13 equal .",
    "_   + * proof .",
    "* this result is well known ; however , we show the result here for completeness .",
    "concavity ( convexity ) implies @xmath26 = f(\\lambda).\\ ] ] thus the minimum ( maximum ) value of @xmath24 is obtained for one of the @xmath13 equal to @xmath25 and the rest zero .",
    "similarly concavity ( convexity ) implies @xmath27 so the maximum ( minimum ) value of @xmath24 is obtained for all @xmath13 equal to @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29   +    note that , because we allow the possibility that @xmath9 is strictly convex , our measure may be considered to be a measure of entropy or of purity ( for simplicity we always call it entropy ) .",
    "this generality is useful because it allows us to easily apply our results to cases such as the linear entropy and the @xmath0 entropy .",
    "the third condition is not absolutely necessary for @xmath30 to be a reasonable entropy measure .",
    "however , we include it because it is necessary in order to derive the bounds in the next section .",
    "note that we do not require that the derivative exists at the endpoints 0 and 1 .",
    "allowing the possibility of derivatives that diverge at the endpoints means that our results may be applied to the von neumann entropy .",
    "note also that conditions 2 and 3 imply that the derivative @xmath19 must be one - to - one .",
    "the derivative @xmath19 will be monotonically increasing ( decreasing ) if @xmath9 is convex ( concave ) .    because the entropy measure @xmath16 depends only on the eigenvalues of the density operator , it is equivalent to the entropy measure for classical probabilities : @xmath31 where @xmath9 satisfies conditions 13 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath32 , where @xmath22 is the set of eigenvalues for @xmath1 .",
    "this is a generalisation of the relation between the von neumann entropy and the shannon entropy .",
    "we may also define an analogous general measure of entanglement for pure states : @xmath33 where @xmath9 is a function satisfying conditions 13 , @xmath34 is a pure state shared between two subsystems @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and @xmath13 are the schmidt coefficients of @xmath34 .    the bounds that we derive in the next section may be applied to all three cases : @xmath37 for classical entropy , @xmath16 for the entropy of mixed quantum states and @xmath38 for entanglement of pure quantum states .",
    "these three cases are mathematically identical , although the physical interpretations are different .",
    "in this section we show how to determine the upper and lower bounds on one generalised entropy for a given value of another generalised entropy . we will present the derivation in terms of the entropy for probability distributions .",
    "the results for entropies of mixed states and entanglement measures immediately follow from this result .    from @xcite the maximum and minimum shannon entropies for a given value of the index of coincidence ( where @xmath39 ) are obtained for probability distributions @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 and there are @xmath44 probabilities equal to @xmath45 .",
    "note that both probability distributions and are parametrised by the single real number @xmath45 .",
    "the result given in @xcite for the von neumann and linear entropies is equivalent , except that the coefficients @xmath13 are eigenvalues of a density matrix .",

    "+ here , and in the following derivations , the notation @xmath49 is equivalent to @xmath51 , and means @xmath19 as a function of @xmath52 . because the function @xmath48 is strictly concave or convex , and the derivative @xmath52 exists in the interval @xmath20 , @xmath52 must be a one - to - one function of @xmath53 in this interval .",
    "hence it is possible to invert this function to obtain @xmath53 as a function of @xmath52 ( i.e.  @xmath54 ) . in turn",

    "the other restrictions on the functions @xmath9 and @xmath48 are simply necessary to ensure that these are valid entropy measures .",
    "it is also important to note that , for each value of @xmath50 , the probability distributions of the forms and are unique , and hence we obtain unique values for the upper and lower limits on @xmath37",

    "this point is a boundary to the range of @xmath45 ; thus , @xmath50 must be a one - to - one function of @xmath45 .",
    "hence , for each value of @xmath50 , there is a unique value of @xmath45 and therefore a unique probability distribution .",
    "the situation is similar for the probability distribution , except there is an additional complication due to multiple values of @xmath60 . in the same way as for",

    "the method we will use for the proof is to first consider the restricted case for three probabilities in lemmas 35 , and then apply the result to prove theorem 1 .",
    "when there are only three probabilities , the problem reduces to finding the maximum and minimum of a function of a single real variable .",
    "this problem is relatively straightforward , and may be solved by finding the boundaries of the domain of the function , as well as the turning points . before we proceed to the case for three probabilities , there is a minor result that we need to prove for the case of two probabilities .",
