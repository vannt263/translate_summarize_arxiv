    "strongly correlated electrons on lattices with geometric frustration can lead to new physical properties .",
    "these come essentially from the quantum fluctuations acting on an extensively degenerate collection of classical ground states . from that point of view , strongly interacting spinless fermions ( or alternatively , fully spin polarized electrons ) on a frustrated lattice present an interesting example of this kind of physics .",
    "a spectacular consequence for example is that at certain fillings , fractionally charged excitations have been predicted for the case of large nearest - neighbor repulsion on certain frustrated lattices.@xcite the subject is not purely academic since there is experimental evidence that electrons in systems which have the considered lattice structure can be strongly correlated.@xcite furthermore , certain optical lattices with frustrated interactions can be produced by interfering laser beams and loaded with fermionic atoms . by varying the lattice constant",
    ", the strength of the correlations of the particles can be modified.@xcite    in the present work we focus on the problem of strongly correlated electrons on a checkerboard lattice at two different filling fractions .",
    "this lattice can be seen as a two - dimensional projection of the pyrochlore lattice ( 3d tetrahedra are represented by 2d squares whose diagonals and sides are on an equal footing as far as couplings are concerned ) .",
    "we will consider the case of strong nearest neighbor repulsion that favors the least possible number of fermions in each such square . at half - filling ,",
    "this number is two , and an effective low - energy model maps onto a quantum fully - packed loop ( fpl ) model on a square lattice . some parts of this work have been briefly discussed before.@xcite in the case of quarter - filling , a lowest potential energy arrangement corresponds to one fermion per square which can be mapped onto a hardcore dimer model .",
    "here we supplement the study with further results and different aspects of the problem regarding the symmetries and conserved quantities , the sign problem and the corresponding gauge theories .",
    "we will discuss a number of consequences , especially related to the fermionic nature of the loops / dimers in this particular problem .",
    "quantum dimer models ( qdms ) have have been studied quite extensively in the past two decades . @xcite",
    "originally introduced in the context of quantum magnetism @xcite , they became a focus of renewed interest following the discovery of a gapped quantum liquid phase on a triangular lattice.@xcite it has been further established that a gapped topological phase with deconfined excitations generically exists in 2d for qdms on _ non - bipartite _ lattices .",
    "@xcite such a phase has been found to have an effective description in terms of a z@xmath0 gauge theory.@xcite by contrast , on bipartite lattices ( e.g. a square lattice ) there is a single deconfined quantum critical point separating phases of broken translation / rotation symmetry .",
    "@xcite such a point is characterized by gapless excitation spectrum which in turn leads to logarithmic confinement at any finite temperature . in both cases , qdms can be mapped onto loop models , with one significant difference : on a bipartite lattice the resulting loops can be naturally oriented while there is no natural notion of direction on a non - bipartite lattice . as a consequence ,",
    "an effective gauge theory for a bipartite case is now a u(1 ) theory ( the oriented loops can be though of as field lines in the absence of sources).@xcite in addition , oriented loops naturally lend themselves to a height representation whereby they serve as contour lines . several related models , such as the quantum six / eight - vertex models in 2d have been shown to conform to the same dichotomy : a model with orientable loops is either ordered or critical and is described by a u(1 ) gauge theory while non - orientable quantum loops can result in a deconfined topological phase .",
    "@xcite in all these models , the hilbert space typically separates into disconnected subspaces corresponding to various conserved quantum numbers .",
    "when these quantum numbers are of non - local topological nature , such as winding numbers , the corresponding subspaces are referred to as topological sectors .",
    "while a z@xmath0 topological phase is characterized by four such sectors and a corresponding four - fold ground state degeneracy on a torus , the u(1 ) models have a much larger number of conserved quantities .",
    "all aforementioned models share one important feature : all off - diagonal matrix elements connecting various quantum dimer / quantum loop states are non - positive ( or can be made non - positive by a trivial gauge transformation such as associating a phase to dimers at certain locations ) . within each disconnected sector",
    "the hamiltonian dynamics is ergodic in the following sense : every two quantum states form a non - zero matrix element with _ some _ power of the hamiltonian .",
    "( here we are not concerned with the issue of how such a power may depend on the system size  a question essential for understanding the spectral gap or a lack thereof . )",
    "the perron - frobenius theorem can then be applied to @xmath1 for some positive @xmath2 within each disconnected subspace ; it is follows that the ground state for each sector is unique and nodeless.@xcite    much less is known about models with non - frobenius dynamics which results in some positive matrix elements .",
    "a striking difference between frobenius vs. non - frobenius qdms on the kagome lattice was found in refs .",
    "[ ] : while the conventional qdm exhibits a gapped z@xmath0 topological phase , its counterpart with different signs has an extensive ground state degeneracy .",
    "a different class of non - frobenius lattice models has also been studied recently : fermionic models with supersymmetric hamiltonians ; in a number of cases such systems have been shown to have an extensive gs degeneracy.@xcite . from these examples",
    ", it appears that the non - frobenius dynamics are often the source of additional quantum frustration resulting in the extensive ground state entropy .",
    "the goal of the present manuscript is to present a number of results ( and some open questions ) related to another non - frobenius model that was originally introduced in refs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we begin by introducing the considered model and derive an effective low - energy hamiltonian in the following section . in section  [ cons ] , we begin by analyzing the conservation laws specific to both quarter and half - filled cases , and the constraints they impose on the quantum dynamics .",
    "we discuss the nature of the sign problem and present two different approaches to alleviating it . in section  [ sec : rk ] we extend the model by adding an extra term in the effective hamiltonian that punishes flippable configurations . in such an extended model , we analyze in detail the rokshar  kivelson ( rk ) point and discuss the phase diagram . in section  [ sec : gauge ] , we discuss the gauge theory for both the quarter - filled and the half - filled cases .",
    "we conclude and summarize our results in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "our starting hamiltonian for spinless fermions is of the following form : @xmath3 where the summation is performed over neighboring sites of a checkerboard lattice .",
    "we are interested in the strongly interacting limit @xmath4 .",
    "note that each site has six nearest neighbors as in the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the configurations favored by the interaction term depend on the doping , i.e. , on the ratio of the number of particles to the number of the available sites .",
    "the fact that the particles are spinless fermions automatically prohibits double occupancy of sites .",
    "furthermore , the interaction term favors uniform minimization of the number of such fermions on every crisscrossed square , a `` planar tetrahedron .",
    "'' we will be mostly interested in a case of half - filling whereby the potential energy term is minimized whenever there are two fermions on each `` planar tetrahedron '' as shown in figure  [ fig : lattice - dimers](a , b ) ( the tetrahedron rule @xcite ) .",
    "the other case considered in parallel with the half - filling in this work is that of quarter - filling whereby the interaction energy is minimized by having one fermion per tetrahedron as shown in figure  [ fig : lattice - dimers](c , d).@xcite in either case , configurations satisfying these rules can be represented by fpls / dimers on a square lattice connecting the centers of the planar tetrahedra .",
    "the particles are sitting in the middle of the bonds of the square lattice . at half - filling",
    ", the tetrahedron rule translates into a fpl covering . by the same token , at quarter - filling",
    ", the minimum interaction energy manifold is spanned by the dimer coverings of the square lattice such that each site belongs to one and only one dimer . in either case ,",
    "all other configurations are separated by a potential energy gap of at least @xmath5 .",
    "different fpl / dimer configurations are orthogonal to each other since they correspond to different locations of fermions ( here we assume that these locations simply label the orthonormal set of wannier functions ) .",
    "@xmath6 + @xmath6    both at half- and at quarter - filling , the kinetic term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hubbard1 ] ) moves particles between the neighboring sites thus creating configurations in which the respective tetrahedron rules are violated .",
    "however , we are interested in the physics at the energy scale much smaller than @xmath5 and therefore we should look at the correlated multi - particle hops ( ring exchanges ) instead .",
    "the lowest - order process that does not take the system out of the low - energy manifold is a two - particle ring exchange depicted in figure  [ fig : lattice - dimers](a , c ) .",
    "such a process represents the dominant quantum dynamics for bosonic systems as well as for resonating valence bonds in spin systems.@xcite however , its amplitude vanishes identically for fermions : the relative signs of clockwise and counterclockwise processes are opposite as a consequence of the fermionic exchange statistics , and the two contributions cancel each other .",
    "moreover , the same observation holds for all ring exchanges involving any _ even numbers _ of fermions ; the contributions from clock- and counterclockwise moves of an even number of fermions similarly cancel .",
    "therefore , the shortest allowed fermionic ring exchanges involve three particles rather than two ( see figure  [ fig : lattice - dimers](b , d ) ) . note that if the spin of fermions is included , processes of order @xmath7 do no longer vanish : two electrons with opposite spin can resonate around empty plaquettes of the checkerboard lattice and lower the energy.@xcite by projecting the full hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hubbard1 ] ) onto the hilbert subspace restricted by the tetrahedron rules , we can perturbatively obtain an effective ring - exchange hamiltonian that acts _ within _ such a subspace.@xcite to lowest non - vanishing order in @xmath8 , such effective hamiltonian becomes : @xmath9(0.1,0)(0.1,0.1 ) \\pspolygon[](0,0)(0.2,0)(0.2,0.1)(0,0.1 ) \\endpspicture\\ ; } , { \\ ;",

    "such a gauge transformation , however , does not fix the relative sign of the different ring exchange terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ringexone ] )  this issue will be addressed in the following section .",
    "in this section , we discuss several aspects of the effective low - energy hamiltonians which were derived in the previous section .",
    "[ cons ]      our first observation is that both at quarter and half - filling , the low energy hilbert space of our model can be represented by height configurations .",
    "this follows from the aforementioned geometric representations of the ground states of the potential energy term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hubbard1 ] ) : in the case of quarter - filling they are the dimer coverings of the square lattice while for the case of half - filling they form fpl on the same lattice , which are isomorphic to six - vertex configurations.@xcite , both , dimer coverings and six - vertex configurations can in turn be mapped onto configurations of an interface  a so - called height representation , also known as a solid - on - solid ( sos ) model.@xcite figure  [ fig : height](a , b ) show one of the ways of assigning heights to the plaquettes of the square lattice for both dimer coverings and fpl configurations .",
    "@xmath18    the quantum dynamics that preserves these geometric constraints then results in quantum fluctuations of the local height variable .",
    "hence our model is a variant of a quantum height model.@xcite let us begin by reiterating some results known from studies of bosonic quantum dimer models@xcite and quantum six - vertex models.@xcite a conservation law which is valid for the ring exchanges of any finite length is the conservation of the global slope of the height field .",
    "the global slope variable has two components , @xmath19 and @xmath20 in @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions , which form a set of conserved numbers .",
    "( in case of periodic boundary conditions , these can be immediately translated into the _ winding numbers_. ) there are two immediate consequences of this conservation law .",
    "the first one concerns the ergodicity of the quantum dynamics : even for arbitrary local ring exchanges , the configurations corresponding to the different topological sectors ( i.e. , different overall slopes ) can not be mixed .",
    "secondly , certain configurations , namely those corresponding to a maximal possible slope in at least one direction must be frozen since any local change in the height field would result in exceeding the maximal possible value of the step somewhere around the affected plaquette(s ) .    for the fermionic variants of the fpl and dimer models , there are two important differences which result from fermionic statistics .",
    "firstly , only ring exchanges involving _ odd numbers _ of particles are allowed ( as discussed in section [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "in particular , the smallest resonating plaquette has perimeter six , rather than four , as captured by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ringexone ] ) and ( [ eq : ringexone - quarter ] ) , and thus the height updates involve _ two _ neighboring plaquettes rather than a single one . from the point of view of the fundamental conserved quantity of quantum height models  the global slope @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the height field",
    "this difference is immaterial since the overall slope can not be changed by any local dynamics .",
    "in addition there is an accidental symmetry in our model , specific to the quantum dynamics in our case : it separately conserves the total numbers of vertical and horizontal dimers ( moreover , it conserves the number of horizontal dimers in even and odd rows separately , and similarly for the vertical dimers ) .",
    "hence , all states can be classified with respect to these quantum numbers which are _ different _ from the aforementioned conserved slopes .",
    "notice that these additional conservation laws will not hold if higher - order ring - exchange terms are added to the effective hamiltonian .",
    "secondly , the sign of the ring - hopping term in the fermionic fpl model depends on the occupancy of the middle bond .",
    "both differences have important implications : the first one  for the ergodicity of the quantum dynamics , while the second one leads to a sign problem in the quantum monte carlo dynamics .",
    "as we will see in the following subsection , the sign problem can be cured in certain cases .",
    "we note that the overall sign of @xmath23 ( i.e. , the sign of @xmath12 ) in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ringexone ] ) and ( [ eq : ringexone - quarter ] ) is a matter of convention ( as has been first pointed out in ref .   for the related bosonic qdm ) . introducing a factor of @xmath24 for each vertical dimer in an odd row of the square lattice and for each horizontal dimer in an odd column changes this sign .",
    "we will now address the sign problem manifested in the opposite signs of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ringexone ] ) and show that it can be avoided in certain ( but not all ) cases .",
    "let us consider the surface with an even number of fermions remaining fixed at the boundary ( `` fixed '' boundary conditions )",
    ". then fermion configurations are represented by closed loops as well as arcs terminating at the boundary . with no fermions at the boundary ,",
    "there are closed loops only , as shown in figure  [ fig : loops](a ) .",
    "we add orientations to the loops as follows : ( i ) color the areas separated by the loops white and grey , with white being the outmost color ; ( ii ) orient all loops so that the white regions are always to the right . in the presence of arcs , figure",
    "[ fig : loops](b ) , we can choose how to close them on the outside without intersections ( the outside region has no dynamics ) .",
    "letting white be the color at infinity , we orient the loops as described above .",
    "we now consider how the effective hamiltonian affects the loops covering .",
    "we first notice that the @xmath26 processes do not change the loop topology ( or their number ) while @xmath27 flips always do , with the possibilities presented schematically in figure  [ fig : loops](c , d ) .",
    "the relative signs resulting from the @xmath25 flips are consistent with multiplying each loop configuration by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the number of the ( counter- ) clockwise winding loop .",

    "firstly , only even - winding sectors on a torus allow two - coloring .",
    "secondly , even for even windings , we can start from a given configuration and find sequences of hexagons - flipping processes which invert the coloring when returning to the initial configuration ( not shown here ) .",
    "this means that it is possible to dynamically reverse the coloring while and thus the sign gauging fails for these cases .",
    "it appears though that for the periodic boundary conditions on _ even _ tori ( preserving the bipartiteness of the lattice ) , the lowest - energy states belong to the sector where such transformation works , as confirmed by the exact diagonalization results ( figure  [ fig : parabola](a ) ) .",
    "the presented non - local loop - orienting construction is furthermore restricted to the ring - exchange processes of length six .",
    "the next higher non - vanishing terms result from processes involving five fermions hopping around a polygon of length 10 .",
    "the fact that the above derived rules for the sign change due to the processes involving three fermions are violated can be seen from a counter example shown in figure  [ fig : parabola](b ) . here",
    "the five fermions hopp around an odd number of fermions in the middle and thus yield a sign change . however , the fifth order process here does _ not _ change the number or the orientation of the loop . consequently , the sign gauging based on the topology of the loops breaks down once these terms are included .",
    "so far , we have attacked the sign problem using topological and computational arguments . in order to complement these approaches with an algebraic expression of the gauge transformation",
    ", we are seeking a possible way of representing the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ringexone ] ) with the kinetic part in such way that the `` sign problem '' , which is manifested in the relative sign of the two terms , disappears .",
    "we use grey - and - white coloring of the plane as has been discussed above .",
    "the two distinct possibilities of coloring a flippable rectangle ( up to an overall color reversal ) are shown in figure  [ fig : dynamics ] .",
    "notice that in both cases , both plaquettes forming a flippable rectangle ( marked by the crosses ) change their colors as a result of a `` flip '' .",
    "the key observation though is that in one case the color of these plaquettes is different and in the other it is the same .    ''",
    "the dashed diagonal lines represent either of the two equivalent ( for the purpose of our argument ) locations of a dimer along one of the adjacent sides of a square .",
    "the red crosses indicate the the double plaquette around which the loop segments resonate.,width=188 ]    let us define an su(2 ) `` isospin '' @xmath33 defined on each plaquette so that the eigenvalue @xmath34 indicates whether the plaquette is white or grey .",
    "we can then rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ringexone ] ) in terms of these new variables : @xmath35 we will now discuss the terms and show that ( [ eq : ringexsigma1 ] ) is a good representation of the original effective hamiltonian .",
    "the operators @xmath36 is a projector which annihilates a state unless a legal flippable configuration exists in the plaquette pair @xmath37 , in which case its eigenvalue is 1 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath36 is complicated  but what is important , it can only depend on the @xmath38 s of the two affected plaquettes and their neighbors .",
    "( this is just a formal consequence of the fact that if we can look at the coloring and tell a flippable configuration from a non - flippable , hence there should be an operator that can do the same thing by `` measuring '' such coloring which in turn is uniquely determined by the values of @xmath38 ) .",
    "if @xmath36 returns 1 upon acting on a configuration , then the operators @xmath39 simply flips the two isospins ( i.e. flips the colors of both plaquettes ) , i.e. , it inverts the colors of the two plaquettes .",
    "the operator @xmath40 determines the overall sign of this flip by distinguishing the two cases shown in figure  [ fig : dynamics ] .",
    "in other words , it yields the sign change which occurs in the @xmath41 processes and represent the sign problem that we are attempting to tackle !    the resolution of the sign problem in the chosen representation is actually trivial : @xmath42 and therefore @xmath43    but the only `` physical '' direction in the isospin space is @xmath44  it corresponds to the plaquette being grey or white .",
    "the choice of @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions is a `` gauge '' choice .",
    "hence we can always do a rotation around the @xmath44 axis , so that @xmath45 ( in fact , we should rotate @xmath46 for the sites of the even / odd sublattice in order to consume the extra minus sign in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ringexsigma2 ] ) ) .",
    "the result is @xmath47 which is precisely eq .",
    "( [ eq : ringexsigma1 ] ) but without the different signs !",

    "@xmath53 simply counts the number of dimers crossing this cut ( i.e. , the number of fermions on the cut ) .",
    "this is actually identical to the jordan  wigner transformation in 1d !",
    "this suggests that our model is `` secretly '' 1d - like , which explains why the fermionic sign can be gauged away .",
    "notice that this nice property appears to be a consequence of restrictive three - particle dynamics described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ringexone ] ) ; adding five - particle ring exchanges seems to lead to a genuine sign problem that can not be similarly fixed by a gauge transformation .",
    "numerous examples demonstrate that a hamiltonian containing only kinetic , plaquette flip ( or ring exchange ) terms leads to an ordered phase stabilized by the `` order by disorder '' mechanism . on a square lattice ,",
    "both the usual qdm and the quantum 6-vertex ( fpl ) models are at their plaquette phase@xcite characterized by a checkerboard pattern ( half as dense for the qdm case ) of resonating plaquettes which break translational but not rotational symmetry of the lattice .",
    "a vary similar plaquette phase occurs on a honeycomb lattice@xcite , where the dimer model and fpl models are simply dual to one another .",
    "moreover , a somewhat more complicated broken symmetry state of the quantum dimers , dubbed @xmath54 , has been found on a non - bipartite , triangular lattice.@xcite in the fermionic case at quarter and half - filling the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ringexone ] ) has also been shown to have an ordered ground state and fractionally charged , `` weakly '' confined excitations.@xcite    in order to explore the possible quantum phases with fermionic ring exchanges , we follow the example of ref .   and extend our model s parameter space by adding a potential term as follows : @xmath55\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for the quarter - filled case and @xmath56\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for the half filled case . here",
    "we use the short - hand notations introduced in eqs .",

    "the important feature of this hamiltonian is that it is positive semidefinite , hence ( i ) a zero - energy state is automatically a ground state and ( ii ) such a state must be annihilated simultaneously by all projectors . the consequence of the fact that the gauge - transformed hamiltonian is of the frobenius type is that for each subspace of states connected by the quantum dynamics , the equal amplitude superposition of such states is a unique `` liquid '' ground state .",
    "there is , however , a separate class of additional ground states  those not connected to any other states .",
    "these states by definition have no flippable configurations and hence are trivially annihilated by hamiltonian  ( [ eq : rk ] ) .",
    "we note that such `` frozen '' states remain zero - energy states of hamiltonians  ( [ eq : ringexqdm]),([eq : ringextwo ] ) for all values of @xmath60 , and remain the ground states for all @xmath61 as these hamiltonians retain their positive semidefinite nature in this region .",
    "@xmath62 + @xmath62 + @xmath62 + @xmath62    while the fermionic nature of our original hamiltonian has been seemingly gauged away , leaving us with a frobenius type , we should recall that it is still manifest in the fact that only odd ring exchanges are allowed .",
    "this has a profound consequence for frozen states .",
    "all bosonic frozen states ( i.e. , frozen under a single plaquette flip dynamics ) remain frozen in our case .",
    "this is immediately obvious on a superficial level : all rectangles flippable by either @xmath25 or @xmath26 terms contain a flippable plaquette , hence a state with no flippable plaquettes is impervious the dynamics of hamiltonians  ( [ eq : ringexqdm ] ) or ( [ eq : ringextwo ] ) . on a deeper level ,",
    "bosonic frozen states remain frozen under fermionic dynamics since they are unaffected by _ any _ local ring exchange ( see figures  [ fig : frozen](a , b ) ) . in the height language , these states maximize the slope in some direction , making any local dynamics impossible .",
    "there are typically @xmath63 such configurations , their exact number may depend on the boundary conditions .",
    "such counting is easiest at half - filling where one may maximize the slope of an @xmath64 system in in either @xmath65 or @xmath66 direction , which still leaves one with a freedom of @xmath67 possible arrangements of steps in the other direction resulting in a @xmath68 number of frozen states . in the quarter - filled ( qdm ) case",
    "there are four _ staggered _ states of the type shown in figure  [ fig : stag1-quarter ] that maximize the slope in either @xmath65 or @xmath66 direction , with the slope in the other direction automatically fixed to zero .",
    "additional frozen states can be obtained by creating diagonal domain walls between horizontal and vertical staggered states . once again , all these states remain frozen under any local dynamics , fermionic or bosonic .",
    "the non - trivial consequence of the fermionic dynamics is the appearance of a large number of additional frozen states that is not related to maximizing the slope , in fact many of these states are in the flat sector .",
    "two such examples are presented in see figures  [ fig : frozen](c , d ) .",
    "both the columnar state of quantum dimers ( figure  [ fig : column - quarter ] ) and the analogous state of fpl ( figure  [ fig : column - half ] ) actually maximize the number of flippable plaquettes , yet both are fluctuationless under _ any _ fermionic dynamics .",
    "these states ( along with staggered states ) are members of a larger family of frozen fermionic states shown in figures  [ fig : frozen](e , f ) . at quarter - filling , any state with only horizontal or only vertical dimers clearly can not be changed by the application of the @xmath69 terms since such terms necessarily involve both horizontal and vertical dimers .",
    "moreover , it is easy to show that _ any _ ring exchange consisting of alternating occupied and empty bonds will involve an even number of fermions in this state and hence is not allowed .",
    "there are @xmath70 such states .",
    "a similar logic dictates that all fpl states like that shown in figure  [ fig : generic - half ] are frozen under any fermionic dynamics : whenever the loops can be sorted into two sets ( shown in red and blue ) in such a way that an empty bond always connects loops belonging to different sets , all ring exchanges are necessarily even .",
    "the number of such states has been counted by us in ref .  [ ] and shown to scale as @xmath71 for large @xmath72 . a number of additional fluctuationless states with the same `` bipartite '' property of loops ",
    "see e.g. figures  [ fig : frozen](g , h )  can be constructed , yet we were unable to systematically count them . hence it remains an open question whether our rk point is characterized by a truly extensive gs entropy like that found in ref .",
    "[ ] or refs .  [ ] .",
    "in particular , one wonders whether our model can be actually related to this latter class of supersymmetric models@xcite in any simple way . in short ,",
    "the supersymmetric hamiltonians are constructed as @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that if one chooses @xmath75 , where @xmath76 projects out the states with fermions occupying sites adjacent to @xmath24 , then such hamiltonians _ may _ have an exponentially large number of zero - energy states ( which are necessarily ground states ) .",
    "this conclusion , however , is sensitive to both the filling fractions and the underlying lattices . while the checkerboard lattice has actually been studied in this context@xcite  under the name of `` square dimer lattice ''  our hamiltonian is clearly different .",
    "the ring exchange terms can in fact be produced within this framework by choosing @xmath77 where @xmath78 ; the sum is performed over all `` flippable '' rings consisting of sites @xmath79 . the resulting supersymmetric hamiltonian is both local and contains ring exchanges , yet it also contains other terms ( including additional one- and two - particle hopping terms ) .",
    "what is the relation between the states of such a hamiltonian and our hamiltonian at its rk point is an interesting open question .",
    "a related question is whether our hamiltonian can actually be written in a supersymmetric form by a more judicious choice of @xmath80 .",
    "whether or not this is the case , it remains quite suggestive that the explanation for the large number of additional frozen ground states lies in a more restrictive nature of the fermionic dynamics .",
    "we reiterate that these `` new '' frozen states are not related to any tilt constraints in the height language .",
    "the fact the frozen states now include the maximally flat states ( figure  [ fig : frozen](c , d ) ) is particularly interesting since they are supposed to dominate the ordered phase of both quarter - filled and the half - filled bosonic model for @xmath81 by maximizing the number of the flippable plaquettes . at quarter - filling ,",
    "this is a columnar phase quantum dimers ; @xmath82 numerically.@xcite at half - filling , this is a conventional anti - ferroelectric phase of the six - vertex model referred to as the nel phase in ref .",

    "@xmath62      the quantum dynamics of the hamiltonian @xmath23 and similarly @xmath84 can be described in terms of a height model as described above .",
    "@xcite the associated conserved quantities @xmath85 and @xmath86 , as well as their insensitivity to a constant shift of the height field imply gapless hydrodynamic modes with @xmath87 as @xmath88 .",
    "the liquid state of the fpl model at the rk point corresponds to the rough phase of the height model , in which case the modes can be identified as the so - called resonons at wave vector @xmath89 @xcite and the equivalent of the pi0ns , here at @xmath90.@xcite in the following we will elaborate on this physics .    for constructing gapless excitations in our model",
    ", we adopt the single - mode approximation @xcite which has been successfully used for the qdm on the square lattice.@xcite a trial state with a momentum which differs from that of the ground state by q is constructed .",
    "the momentum is a good quantum number in a translationally invariant system . then the variational principle employed on the states at that momentum yields the basic result that the energy of the trial state provides an upper bound on the excitation energy at that momentum .",
    "therefore , as a matter of principle , one can use the sma to prove gaplessness . in order to demonstrate the presence of a gap , a different method is needed .",
    "let @xmath91 be one of the aforementioned `` liquid '' gs at the rk point .",

    "the ground state correlations encode information on the excitation spectrum and some of them can be captured by the variational method which leads to the above expression .",
    "sma is useful then because there are situations in which gaplessness is present in a generic manner .",
