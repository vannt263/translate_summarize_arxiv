    "modern low cost devices are increasingly based on organic semiconductors . this important class of materials allows to achieve well - priced thin film transistors and optical components such as light emitting diodes .",
    "an important intermediate step in this technology is the possibility to control the growth behaviour of active organic materials in terms of orientation and structure on short length scales .",
    "to do so patterned thin surface layers or self - assembled monolayers can be used .",
    "the patterning of such films can be achieved in various ways including but not limited to soft lithography,@xcite scanning probe techniques ( dip pen lithography,@xcite nanografting,@xcite etc . ) , energetic beams ( uv - light,@xcite electrons,@xcite etc . ) and many more.@xcite    here , we present a friction force microscopy ( ffm ) study of thin surface layers of a photosensitive thiocyanate - functionalized trialkoxysilane on silicon oxide ( sio@xmath0 ) . these films can be reliably prepared on this technological important surface with a high degree of control over the final film thickness . however , more important is the fact that these films can easily be modified by uv light and subsequently functionalized.@xcite    as different end groups of the molecule will have different interaction with the probe of the atomic force microscope , ffm@xcite allows to differentiate between them . using this approach ,",
    "four different terminations could be distinguished and hierarchically ordered on a sample that has been subsequently irradiated twice using line masks with different feature spacings . as a result",
    "the different terminations could be hierarchically ordered by their interaction strength with the afm probe .",
    "for the preparative work of the organic thin surface layers , hazardous chemicals and solvents are used ( ammonium thiocyanate , methanol , propylamine , 2,2,2-trifluoroethylamine , and piranha solution ) .",
    "in addition , piranha solution is explosive , and its preparation is highly exothermic ( up to 120@xmath1c ) .",
    "therefore , reactions must be carried out in a fume hood , and protective clothes and goggles must be used !",
    "uv irradiation causes severe eye and skin burns .",
    "precautions ( uv protective goggles and gloves ) must be taken !",
    "the photoreactive surface layers were prepared by immersion of pretreated ( piranha solution ) boron doped silicon wafers into a solution of trimethoxy[4-(thiocyanatomethyl)phenyl]silane ( si - scn ) in toluene .",
    "x - ray reflectivity measurements revealed a film thickness of 6 nm for these films .",
    "it has to be emphasized here , that obviously this is not a monolayer but an oligolayer with a thickness corresponding to five or six individual layers ( assuming upright standing molecules ) .",
    "the formation of oligolayers is attributed to cross linking of the trimethoxy - silane groups in the presence of water.@xcite in a subsequent step , the samples were illuminated by uv light under inert gas to avoid photo - oxidation ( 254 nm , 80@xmath2 ) .",
    "the illumination leads to an isomerization of the benzyl thiocyanate ( si - scn ) group to the corresponding benzyl isothiocyanate ( si - ncs ) .",
    "this illumination step was done by utilizing a contact mask with equidistant lines and spaces to create a pattern on the surface which consists of alternating stripes of si - scn and si - ncs . for selected samples",
    "an additional post - isomerization modification was performed by exposing the surface to vapours of propylamine . in this process",
    "the isothiocyanate group reacts to the corresponding thiourea group ( si - pa ) . the sequence of the reaction steps together with the respective molecular structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reactions ] .",
    "a detailed description of the film preparation has already been given elsewhere.@xcite        the afm results were obtained with a digital instruments multimode iiia atomic force microscope . to reduce damage to the film , the topographic images were recorded in intermittant contact mode , eliminating effectively lateral forces between the tip and the sample surface . for intermittant mode",
    "normal si probes with a typical resonance frequency of 300khz were used . for roughness characterization ,",
    "the root mean square roughness @xmath3 , the lateral correlation length @xmath4 , and the hurst parameter @xmath5 were calculated from the images using the height - height correlation function ( hhcf).@xcite all roughness parameters have been obtained by analyzing at least three independent 5@xmath6 m images .",
    "ffm ( also called lateral force microscopy ( lfm ) or chemical force microscopy )  @xcite is a special type of contact mode atomic force microscopy .",
    "lateral forces acting on the tip will twist the cantilever , when scanned perpendicular to its long axis , leading to a deflection of the laser on the four quadrant photodiode in lateral direction .",
    "the twist of the cantilever depends on the friction between the tip and the sample surface . as cantilevers ,",
    "specially designed ffm silicon rectangular beam type cantilevers are used .",
    "the cantilevers have a nominal length of 225@xmath6 m and a force constant of typical 0.2n / m .",
    "the lateral force acting on the tip is influenced by the friction coefficient between tip and sample surface .",
    "this coefficient depends on the interaction between the tip and the terminating group of the molecules forming the thin film.@xcite for a clearer contrast , ffm images are calculated from trace and retrace images obtained simultaneously with the topographic image .",
    "this effectively reduces false ffm contrast originating from the surface morphology .",
    "the presented images are therefore always calculated from @xmath7 . for the presented ffm images no scale is given as no force calibration",
    "was performed prior to the measurement .",
    "thus information that can be obtained is purely qualitative , however , with sufficient accuracy allowing to establish a hierarchy of adhesion forces.=1",
    "figure  [ fig : unpatt ] presents afm topography images demonstrating the effect of film preparation on surface roughness . homogeneous films of si - scn ( b ) , and propylamine modified si - ncs ( si - pa ) ( c ) films were prepared and compared to the surface of the bare substrate ( a ) .        the surface of the substrate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : unpatt](a ) ) shows a uniform featureless topography as expected for a silicon dioxide surface .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) roughness of @xmath3=0.2 nm , the lateral correlation length @xmath4=30 nm , and the hurst parameter @xmath5=0.5 confirm the qualitative observation .",

    "deposition of a thin layer of si - scn and subsequent illumination with 254 nm uv light for 20min ( resulting in a si - ncs film shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : unpatt](c ) ) leads to a further slight increase in surface roughness ( @xmath9 nm @xmath10 nm , and @xmath11 ) .",
    "the changes in the roughness parameters can be mainly attributed to contamination of the sample surface due to handling and residue from the chemical compounds used during modifications and cleaning .    in the following ,",
    "ffm data of the patterned films are presented .",
    "figure  [ fig : scn - ncs ] compares the topographic image ( a ) obtained on a si - scn layer that was illuminated through a stripe mask with 10@xmath6 m lines and 10@xmath6 m spaces to the simultaneously recorded ffm image ( b ) .",
    "whereas in the topography image no stripe pattern is visible , a clear stripe pattern with a 10@xmath6 m pitch appears in the ffm image . in all ffm images presented ,",
    "bright areas mean higher friction and dark ones correspond to lower friction .",
    "it will be demonstrated below that the high friction areas correspond to the illuminated si - ncs stripes and the low friction areas are the pristine si - scn stripes covered by the mask during illumination .     mask . in the ffm image ( b )",
    "bright areas correspond to si - ncs terminated areas showing high friction .",
    "the dark stripes are the non - illuminated si - scn areas . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : scn - pa ] shows afm images obtained after the patterned sample described above has been exposed to vapours of propylamine . while the topographic image presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : scn - pa](a ) shows a weak stripe pattern with the expected spacing , the corresponding ffm image in fig .",
    "[ fig : scn - pa](b ) allows a clear identification of the line pattern created by contact lithography and of errors in the masking process ( lower right corner ) . from the combined cross section in fig .",
    "[ fig : scn - pa](c ) the height difference of 0.5 nm between the modified si - pa and the pristine si - scn stripes is clearly discernible .",
    "the addition of an alkyl group to the molecule will result in an increase of the film thickness .",
    "an increased height is therefore only expected for the modified parts of the surface , which are the si - pa areas .",
    "these areas show a lower friction signal .",
    "areas of lower height correspond to non - illuminated ( and unmodified ) zones of the layer containing si - scn structures , which give a higher friction than the si - pa structure .",
    "the increase in layer thickness after reaction with propylamine was 0.6 nm which equals 10% of the initial layer thickness .",
    "this corresponds to results obtained with photoreactive polymers containing benzyl thiocyanate side groups.@xcite        in a further experiment , the surface has been exposed twice to illumination using crossed masks with an intermediate propylamine reaction step .",
    "the whole sample preparation process is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross](a ) . in a first step ,",
    "a mask with 5@xmath6 m lines and spaces was employed during uv illumination .",
    "after the si - scn film has been exposed to vapors of propylamine , a surface layer made up of alternating 5@xmath6 m stripes of si - scn and si - pa is created .",
    "the resulting pattern is similar to the one presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : scn - pa ] .",
    "this modified film was now illuminated for a second time through a mask with 10@xmath6 m lines and spaces oriented perpendicular to the first mask pattern . during this step both stripes , si - pa as well as si - scn , are illuminated partly .",
    "it can be expected that the si - pa surface will not change significantly during this process .",
    "however , the remaining si - scn stripes will be converted into alternating 10@xmath6 m patches of si - scn and si - ncs .",
    "the resulting surface morphology and the friction image are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross](b , c ) . as before , the main features in the topographic image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cross](b ) ) are not related to the mask process but result from contamination and small long range undulations in the sio@xmath0 surface of the wafer .",
    "however , the ffm image shows a clear pattern of regular 5 by 10@xmath6 m patches of four different shadings , i.e. friction levels .",
    "we can identify the four areas using the information on the friction contrast obtained from the previous samples .",
    "the dark areas in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross](b ) are the si - pa areas ( labeled pa ) created in the first illumination step .",
    "the neighboring brighter patches ( pi ) in the 5@xmath6 m stripe are the si - pa areas that were subsequently illuminated a second time . in the neighboring 5@xmath6 m stripes ( shadowed during the first illumination )",
    "one patch has been protected by the mask in both illumination steps ( da ) while the other one has been exposed to uv - light a single time during the second illumination ( il ) .",
    "the last two areas are comparable to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scn - ncs ] and therefore allow the identification of the stripes in fig .",
    "[ fig : scn - ncs](b ) . the areas marked pa and da are comparable to the combination shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scn - pa ] .        the observed friction contrast can therefore be ordered in the following way : the highest tip - film interaction and therefore the largest friction is observed for si - ncs ( il ) followed by si - scn ( da ) and the two propylamine modified surfaces ( pi and pa in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross](b ) ) .",
    "a possible explanation fort his sequence can be given by the different polarity of the individual endgroups at the surface ( thiocyanate ( si - scn ) , isothiocyanate ( si - ncs ) , and propyl ( ch@xmath8-ch@xmath8-ch@xmath12 , si - pa ) ) and by the stiffness of the molecular endgroups .",
    "comparing data on the dipole moment of ethyl isothiocyanate ( 3.67 debye ) and ethyl thiocyanate ( 3.33 debye ) as well as on the surface tension @xmath13 ( at 20@xmath1c ) of these compounds ( ethyl isothiocyanate : @xmath13 = 36.0 mn / m , and ethyl thiocyanate : @xmath13 = 34.8 mn / m ) it is found that isothiocyanates are of higher polarity than the corresponding thiocyanates.@xcite assuming that the friction force between the surface and the silicon tip ( which is covered with a native oxide layer ) increases with the polarity of the surface , for the uv illuminated regions ( containing ncs units at the surface ) a higher friction force will be recorded than for the non - illuminated regions bearing scn units .    after reaction of the photogenerated ncs groups with propylamine ( pa ) , the surface",
    "is terminated with non - polar alkyl groups .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the post - exposure derivatization with propylamine will result in lower friction force .",
    "also the stiffness of the molecule is reported to influence the resulting friction coefficient .",
    "@xcite the flexible alkyl group that terminates si - pa will therefore also reduce the observed friction by bending under the applied normal load .",
    "in contrast , the shorter and stiffer thiocyanate and iso - thiocyanate groups ( si - ncs has two double bonds between sulfur , carbon , and nitrogen ; si - scn has a triple bond between carbon and nitrogen while the sulfur is linked by two single bonds ) can not bend under the applied load .",
    "the intermediate friction contrast observed for areas that were illuminated and modified with propylamine , and then illuminated for a second time , can also be explained that way . during the second illumination , residual scn units  which have remained unreacted in the first illumination step  are converted into ncs groups leading to an increased interaction between the surface and the afm tip .",
    "ncs groups which have reacted with propylamine ( to yield propyl thiourea units ) are expected to remain unchanged during the second illumination step since n , n-dialkyl substituted thiourea groups are stable under uv light . especially from the last sample ,",
    "the hierarchy in the interaction forces ( si - ncs @xmath14 si - scn @xmath14 si - pa ) between the individual terminating groups becomes evident .",
    "for lithographically patterned photoreactive surface layers we demonstrated that friction force microscopy is not only able to distinguish between different head groups , but also that this can be done simultaneously for at least three different terminations .",
    "the method is able to detect minute changes in the molecular structure .",
    "the case of the thiocyanate ( si - scn ) and isothiocyanate ( si - ncs ) head groups is especially relevant since these are educts and products of an isomerization reaction .",
    "ffm is able to discern the two terminations , although , only the sequence of the terminating three atoms is altered .",
    "however , the resulting change in polarity of the terminating molecular groups is large enough to be detected by ffm as different friction levels .",
    "in addition , the post isomerization modification with propylamine could be clearly visualized with ffm . in this case , a further reduction of polarity together with a change in the stiffness of the molecule leads to the lowest friction observed in the investigated system .",
    "currently , contact angle measurements are underway to obtain an independent confirmation of the observed hierarchy .",
    "the next step in future work will be to quantify the adhesive and frictional forces responsible for the qualitative results presented here .",
    "for this task a well known approach suggested in literature will be used to calibrate the afm probes with sufficient accuracy.@xcite these studies shall include the use of functionalized tips to fine tune the probe sample interaction.@xcite"
