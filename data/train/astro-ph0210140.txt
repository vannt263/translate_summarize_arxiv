    "the majority of luminous agn ( active galactic nuclei ) are found to be radio - quiet ( e.g. , kukula 1998 ) ; that is , the radio ( 5  ghz ) to optical ( _ b_-band ) flux ratio is @xmath8  10 ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ; kellerman 1989 ) .",
    "the radio emission of radio - quiet qsos is not non - existent , but is about 100 times less than that of the radio - loud quasars . in general , for a given optical luminosity , the average x - ray emission from radio - quiet agn is about three times lower than that from radio - loud objects ( zamorani 1981 ; worrall 1987 ) . for this reason",
    ", they are more difficult to detect at higher redshifts , so the majority of distant agn studied so far in the x - ray band are radio - loud .",
    "one method of increasing the number of high - z radio - quiet objects observed is to make use of the field sources in deep observations taken with a sensitive instrument , such as _ xmm - newton_. in this paper we present a study of the background field sources from two long _ xmm - newton _ observations ; for both fields optical identifications exist , so that the redshift and optical classification of each object are known .",
    "although unified models exist , claiming that most agn subclasses can be understood simply through orientation effects ( see antonucci 1993 and references therein ) , the difference between radio - quiet and radio - loud qsos ( rqqs and rlqs ) has yet to be completely explained .",
    "it was once thought that rqqs were only found in spiral galaxies , while the rlqs inhabited ellipticals .",
    "however , advances in observing capability now show that as many as 50  per  cent of the rqqs discovered may occur in ellipticals ( e.g. , vron - cetty & woltjer 1990 ) .",
    "rlqs , however , are almost exclusively found in bulge - dominated systems ; that is , in ellipticals or early - type spirals ( falomo , kotilainen & treves 2001 ) .",
    "the _ einstein _ ipc ( imaging proportional counter ) data showed that radio - quiet and radio - loud objects have different power law slopes over the energy range 0.44  kev , with the rqqs being steeper ( e.g. , wilkes & elvis 1987 ) .",
    "follow - up with _ rosat _ ( brinkmann , yuan & siebert 1997 ; yuan 1998 ) confirmed these findings for the soft x - ray band and _ ginga _ ( williams 1992 ) , _ exosat _ ( lawson 1992 ) and _ asca _ ( reeves 1997 ; reeves & turner 2000  rt00 hereafter ) for the harder x - ray energies .",
    "this observed difference in slope ( @xmath13  @xmath1  0.3 over 210  kev ",
    "lawson 1992 ; @xmath13  @xmath1  0.5 in the 0.23.5  kev band  wilkes & elvis 1987 ) may be due to an extra , hard x - ray component linked to the radio emission of rlqs ; i.e. , connected with the radio - jets .    neither _ einstein _ ( canizares & white 1989 ; wilkes & elvis 1987 ) nor _ rosat _ ( yuan 1998 ) found any indication for excess absorption in radio - quiet qsos .",
    "yuan ( 1998 ) also found that the mean spectral slope of nearby rqqs is consistent with that of more distant ( z  @xmath7  2.5 ) qsos , implying that x - ray spectral evolution may be unimportant in the radio - quiet objects .    because of the effective area of its mirrors ,",
    "_ xmm - newton _ can obtain spectra of fainter objects for a given redshift than could any previous x - ray instrument .",
    "this allows us to extend previous surveys of qsos to include those objects with lower luminosity and to observe a given luminosity at a wider range of redshifts . in this respect ,",
    "the luminosities of the objects presented in this paper ( median value of @xmath1  4  @xmath14 erg  s@xmath3 ) are closer to those of the agn which make up the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "[ lumdif ] shows the luminosity distribution of radio - quiet objects surveyed by _ xmm _ in this paper compared , with those surveyed by _ asca _ in rt00 .    in section  [ sec : xmmobs ]",
    "the data reduction is discussed , with the spectral fitting to the individual objects outlined in section  [ sec : specanal ] .",
    "the highest - flux objects are analysed in [ sec : high ] , while the work on mrk  205 itself was presented in a separate paper ( reeves 2001 ) .",
    "finally , the results are discussed in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the objects in this paper were serendipitously located in the fields of two _ xmm _ pointed observations : mrk 205 and qso  0130@xmath0403 .",
    "the mrk  205 data are from a calibration observation , in may 2000 ( obs i d 0124110101 ) .",
    "there were three separate exposures with both the mos and pn cameras ( turner 2001 ; strder 2001 ) , each of which lasted for @xmath117  ksec , and these were co - added before spectral analysis was performed .",
    "qso  0130@xmath0403 was observed only once , for @xmath137  ksec , in june 2001 ( obs id0112630201 ) .",
    "the optical identifications and redshifts for the mrk  205 field are taken from barcons ( 2002 ) , henceforth xb02 , which also quotes x - ray colours and fluxes .",
    "for the qso  0130@xmath0403 field , the ids were taken from the vron - vron 2001 catalogue .",
    "hence , the mrk  205 objects were selected on the basis of their x - ray flux ( @xmath72  @xmath15  erg  @xmath16  s@xmath3 in the 0.54.5  kev band ; xb02 ) , with all objects down to this flux level and not in a ccd chip - gap included .",
    "the objects analysed in the second field were those which had existing optical identifications ; all the optically - selected qsos within the _ xmm _ field of view were detected and included in the sample .    in general",
    ", one might expect that x - ray - selected targets would show harder spectra than those found through optical observations , simply because soft x - ray sources are not as easy to detect , due to galactic absorption . comparing both the slopes over 210 ( rest frame ) and 0.210  ( observed frame )  kev for the objects in the two separate fields , a mean difference of @xmath13  @xmath6  0.1",
    "the actual range of photon indices is also very similar for both of the fields , with the vast majority ( @xmath180  per cent ) of the spectral slopes lying between @xmath17  @xmath1  1.62.4 .",
    "the similarity in the distributions of indices implies that there is no obvious problem in combining these two fields .",
    "the data obtained allow individual spectral fitting for the qsos in these fields .",
    "we present these spectra and investigate the sample as a whole , to determine whether there is any evidence for evolution , compton reflection or excess absorption in the rest frames of the objects .",
    "a wide range of redshifts , from z  =  0.181 to 3.023 , is covered .",
    "the data were reduced with the _ xmm _ sas ( science analysis software ) version 5.2 , using epchain and emchain to generate valid photon lists ; further filtering was then performed using xmmselect . both single and double pixel events ( patterns 04 ) were used when extracting the pn spectra , while patterns 012 were chosen for the mos exposures .",
    "each spectrum was extracted using a circular region of 30 arcsec radius , with the same circle then offset from the source to obtain an estimate of the background .",
    "since the sources were not all close to the centre of the ccds , arfgen was run within the sas , to correct for vignetting effects and the encircled energy fraction .",
    "subsequently , ccd redistribution matrices ( i.e. , _ .rmf _ not _",
    ".rsp _ ) were used .",
    "the energy resolution of the pn chips changes as one moves out from the centre , due to charge transfer effects ; to take this into account , pn rmfs are provided at intervals of 20 rows , with y0 being used for rows 1 - 20 ( furthest from the centre ) up to y9 for the central objects .",
    "for example , epn@xmath18ff20@xmath18sdy9@xmath18qe.rmf was used with arfgen for a central source ( y9 ) , extracted for patterns 0 - 4 ( sd  =  singles and doubles ) in a full - frame ( ff ) image . note that",
    ", for pure redistribution matrices , the type of filter ( thin , medium or thick ) is not included ; this becomes part of the ancillary response function ( arf ) generated .",
    "for mos , the relevant responses were m1@xmath18r5@xmath18all@xmath1815.rmf and m2@xmath18r5@xmath18all@xmath1815.rmf ( _ all _ meaning the spectra were extracted for patterns 012 ) .",
    "see * http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/ccf/epic * for more details .",
    "after using the ftool command grppha , to provide a minimum of 20 counts per bin , the xspec v11.0.1 software package was used to analyse the background - subtracted spectra .",
    "the value of the galactic absorption was obtained using the ftool n@xmath19 , which uses data from dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) .",
    "n@xmath19 was found to be 3  @xmath20  @xmath16 for the mrk  205 field and 1.9  @xmath20  @xmath16 for the qso  0130@xmath0403 field .",
    "h@xmath21 was taken to be 50  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 and q@xmath21 to be 0.5 . unless stated otherwise , the errors given are at the 1  @xmath22 level .    of the 23 agn analysed in this paper ,",
    "only two ( xmmu j013257.8 - 401030 and xmmu j013333.8 - 395554 ) have actual ( upper limit ) radio observations , of 0.4 mjy at 5  ghz ( miller , peacock & mead 1990 ) . none of the others are detected in the nvss ( nrao vla sky survey ) , down to the survey completeness flux limit of about 2.5 mjy . using this flux limit ( and the two actual upper limits ) , we find that six of the agn are definitely radio - quiet .",
    "although the remaining seventeen objects could be radio - loud , it is found that ( again using the nvss survey limit ) most would only be slightly so , with twelve having r  @xmath6  60 .",
    "statistically , one would expect @xmath120  per  cent of the blagn ( with x - ray fluxes above 10@xmath23  erg  @xmath16  s@xmath3 ) in an xmm field to be radio loud ( based on studies of sources within the _ xmm _ observation of the lockman hole ; private communication , lehmann 2002 ) ; this corresponds to @xmath14 objects in a sample of this size .",
    "however , as our survey does not go as deep as 10@xmath23  erg  @xmath16  s@xmath3 , it should be expected that this is an upper limit to the number of radio - loud sources .",
    "as is conventional , the spectrum for each source was first modelled using a simple power law , together with neutral hydrogen absorption fixed at the galactic value .",
    "the majority of sources were seen with both the mos and pn , although the occasional source would be positioned in one of the chip gaps , or over a bad column . where both mos and pn ccds could be used , joint fits were performed . for sixteen of the qsos ,",
    "the single power law model produced a good fit , with @xmath24  @xmath1  0.81.2 .",
    "the remaining seven objects showed slightly worse statistics , but the fits were still acceptable .",
    "table  [ sources ] lists the redshift and optical magnitude ( from xb02 for the mrk  205 field and ned  the nasa extragalactic database  for the objects around qso  0130@xmath0403 ) , count - rate , flux , luminosity and 210  kev ( qso rest frame ) spectral slope ( all derived from our data ) for each of the 23 sources .",
    "all but three of the objects in this sample are broad line agn ( blagn ) .",
    "xmmu  j122120.5 + 751616 and xmmu  j122206.4 + 752613 are classified as narrow emission line agn ( nlagn ) by xb02 , with xmmu  j122258.1 + 751934 tentatively classified as the same .",
    "it should be noted that the optical spectrum for this last object is not of high quality and there is , therefore , some uncertainty in the given redshift of 0.257 . it can be seen from the column giving the luminosities that all except two of the objects have a 210  kev luminosity of @xmath710@xmath25  erg  s@xmath3",
    "; they should , therefore , be classified as qsos , rather than any of the lower - luminosity objects which come under the title of agn .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "within this sample of agn are 7 objects with 210  kev fluxes of greater than 5  @xmath26  erg  @xmath16  s@xmath3 . these have spectra with sufficiently good signal - to - noise to allow individual analysis in greater detail .    the central object of the second field , qso  0130@xmath0403 ( xmmu  j013302.0 - 400628 in the tables ) , has the highest _ luminosity _ , at 8.28  @xmath27  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "the qso was discovered by smith ( 1976 ) on tololo survey plates and found to be a very blue object , from the optical photometry published by adam ( 1985 ) .",
    "it has previously been observed in the low - energy x - ray region by the _ rosat _ pspc ( position sensitive proportional counter ) , which gave a value of @xmath17  =  1.69@xmath28 , when fixing n@xmath29 to the galactic value ( bechtold 1994 ) .",
    "when fitting the 210  kev rest - frame band , the addition of an ionised fe emission line , with the line width ( @xmath22 ) set to 0.1  kev , decreased @xmath30 by 5 for 2 degrees of freedom , which corresponds to a marginal detection at @xmath790  per  cent .",
    "( the width of the line could not be well constrained : @xmath22  =  0.34  @xmath4  0.29 ) . over the full",
    "0.210  kev observed band ( corresponding to 0.840.2  kev rest frame ) , the best fit model consists simply of a power law ( @xmath17  =  2.09  @xmath4  0.03 ) and the emission line , detailed above , at 6.62  @xmath4  0.12  kev , the equivalent width of the line being @xmath1200  ev in the qso rest frame ( @xmath150  ev observed ) .",
    "there is no requirement for additional column density or a soft excess .",
    "the spectrum is shown in figure  [ q_1 ] .    as mentioned in section  [ sec : specanal_speccurv ] , there is evidence for neutral reflection in this spectrum , with the 90  per  cent confidence range for r being 1.113.85 ; i.e. consistent with reflection from the full 2@xmath31 steradians of an accretion disc .    as stated earlier",
    ", most of the spectra did not require the presence of a strong soft excess .",
    "for each of the high flux objects , a blackbody component was added into the model , with the temperature fixed at 0.1  kev ; the 90  per  cent upper limit was then calculated for the luminosity over 0.210  kev ; in general this was found to be @xmath810 per cent of the strength of the power law . for a low - luminosity qso , such as mrk  205 ( reeves 2001 ) , this is a typical value for the relative strength of the soft excess compared to the power law component ; thus , the objects in this sample are consistent with other low - luminosity qsos , where better signal - to - noise in the spectra allow more detailed analysis of the soft excesses .",
    "all the high - flux spectra ( figure  [ highfluxobjects ] ) were systematically fitted to search for the presence of iron lines and reflection . with the exception of qso  0130@xmath0403 ,",
    "neither iron emission nor the compton reflection hump could be constrained in any of the individual spectra , with 90 per cent upper limits on the equivalent widths of the iron lines lying between 145650  ev .",
    "it should be noted that two of these bright objects are those classified as narrow line agn by xb02  xmmu  j122206.4 + 752613 and xmmu  j122258.1 + 751934 .",
    "these are the only two high - flux objects which have measureable excess absorption ; the values , however ( @xmath8  few  @xmath32  @xmath16 ) , are not of a large enough magnitude completely to obscure broad - line regions and , hence , to explain the narrow - line classification .",
    "since mrk  205 has been presented in an earlier paper , its spectrum has not been re - fitted . however , from reeves ( 2001 ) , we find that the spectral slope for mrk  205 is 1.80  @xmath4  0.04 , for the energy band 2.510  kev .",
    "this includes two gaussian components : a narrow ( @xmath22  =  10  ev ) line at e  =  6.39  @xmath4  0.02  kev and a broader ( @xmath22  =  250@xmath33  ev ) one at e  =  6.74  @xmath4  0.12  kev .",
    "the broad - band spectrum shows a slight soft excess , and is best fitted by @xmath17  =  1.86  @xmath4  0.02 and a blackbody component with kt  =  120  @xmath4  8  ev , together with the two emission lines .",
    "it is clear that these values for the slopes are consistent with those for the objects presented in this paper .",
    "our fits to the qso spectra implied that the rqqs observed have no additional absorption above that due to our own galaxy .",
    "the flatter spectral slopes for some objects could not be explained by obscuration in the agn ; this agrees with the _ xmm _ observation of the lockman hole ( hasinger 2001 ; mainieri 2002 ) , in that our sources are type-1 agn , while their intrinsically absorbed objects are mainly type-2 .",
    "one possibility is that we are not reaching a low enough ( @xmath34  erg  @xmath16  s@xmath3 ) flux level to be measuring spectra of these faint , obscured sources , within these two fields .",
    "however , the lack of any absorption above the galactic value agrees with previous studies of radio - quiet qsos , e.g. , with _",
    "( canizares & white 1989 ; objects with 0.1@xmath6z@xmath63.5 ) , _ rosat _ ( yuan 1998 ; z@xmath72 ) and _ ginga _ ( lawson & turner 1997 ; z@xmath61.4 ) .",
    "indeed the radio - quiet qsos in this sample appear to remain unabsorbed up to redshifts of z  @xmath1  3 .    radio - loud objects , on the other hand , do tend to show excess absorption ( e.g. , elvis 1994 ; brinkmann , yuan & siebert 1997 ; rt00 ) . the data from rt00 show an average column density of 1.29  @xmath35  @xmath16 for radio - loud quasars . for the sample of rqqs in this paper , a mean of 2.96  @xmath32  @xmath16",
    "is found for the _ upper limits _ , which is noticeably smaller .",
    "it is known that the low - energy response of the _ asca _ sis has been degrading over time ( see yaqoob 2000 ) .",
    "the effect of this is an underestimate of the soft x - ray flux , which can show itself as an increase in n@xmath29 . in order to check that the differences found between the rlq and rqq distributions are not instrument - linked , the measured column densities for two objects which have been observed by both _ xmm _ and _ asca _ were compared ( _ asca _ values were taken from rt00 ; _ xmm _ values calculated for own data for pks  0558@xmath0504 and taken from reeves 2001 for mrk  205 ) .",
    "it was found that , within the errors , the instruments agreed ; it can , therefore , be assumed that the absorption measured for the rt00 radio - loud sample is not due simply to the _ asca _ calibration .",
    "statistical tests were applied to both the radio - quiet objects from this paper and the radio - loud ones from rt00 , to determine whether there was evidence for a difference in population .",
    "[ rq+l ] shows the column densities against redshift for this combined sample , with the _ asca_-detected rlqs marked by crosses and the _ xmm _ rqqs by circles / arrows .    due to the overwhelming presence of censored data ( that is , upper limit measurements )",
    ", the _ asurv _ ( astronomy survival analysis ) software was used ( see feigelson & nelson 1985 ) . employing each of the possible two - sample tests",
    ", we found that the probability that the rqqs and rlqs are from the same population was very low : @xmath60.01  per  cent .",
    "the kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test was also performed on the data , leading to a probability of @xmath13.4  per  cent for the existence of one population only .",
    "other statistical tests were also tried , each method confirming the same result : the radio - quiet qsos in our sample were found to belong to a different population from the radio - loud objects in rt00 ( probability of @xmath799.99  per  cent in general ) .",
    "summarising , we find that , although rlqs tend to show excess absorption at high redshifts , rqqs do not , at least up to z  @xmath1  3 .",
    "this implies that there is an intrinsic difference in the local environment of the two types of qso at high redshifts .",
    "it must be noted that the situation for radio - quiet qsos at higher redshifts ( z  @xmath7  5 ) is unclear ; deep _ xmm _ observations of individual , bright high - redshift qsos are required to explore this possibility .",
    "the qsos in this sample all show the same range of continuum photon indices , regardless of luminosity or redshift , over the energy range 210  kev . comparing the slopes over",
    "the full 0.210  kev range gave the same results .",
    "canizares & white ( 1989 ) also find no evidence for a @xmath17-z dependence from the _ einstein _ data , up to a maximum energy of 4  kev .",
    "likewise , yuan ( 1998 ) found that the spectral slopes of distant ( z  @xmath7  2.5 ) rqqs were consistent ( within the errors ) with those of nearby objects ; _ rosat _ covered the energy range 0.12.4  kev .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "data in rt00 also showed no significant correlation between @xmath17 and redshift , over a similar energy range to that of _ xmm_. the independence of spectral slope and redshift is also observed in the higher energy band ( e@xmath362  kev ) of radio - loud objects [ e.g. , comparison between @xmath17 from _ exosat _ data ( lawson 1992 ) and _ ginga _ ( williams 1992 ) ] .",
    "there also appears to be no evolution with redshift of the extreme - ultraviolet spectral slope , for either rl or rqqs ( telfer 2002 ) .",
    "the link between the different regions of the spectral energy distributions of agn is , as yet , uncertain , with no complete theory having been generally accepted .",
    "the observed lack of correlation between slope and redshift may suggest , however , that the luminosity of these qsos is simply scaling as the black hole mass  i.e. @xmath37 remains constant with respect to the eddington value , as the overall spectral energy distribution remains unchanged .",
    "different values of the accretion rate could then be responsible for some of the dispersion of the spectral slopes that is observed ( e.g. , liu , mineshige & shibata 2002 ) .",
    "alternatively , the spread of @xmath17 may be due to different disc - corona geometries ( czerny & elvis 1987 ; fabian 2002 ) .",
    "it should be noted that this dispersion in slope is also observed in the low - luminosity seyferts , as well as qsos : narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies tend to have softer spectra than the corresponding broader line objects ; this may be explained if these objects are accreting at a greater fraction of the eddington rate , when compared to the broad line agn ( pounds , done & osborne 1995 ) .      for the signal - to - noise of the data presented here",
    ", it is not possible to make a conclusive statement on the presence or absence of reflection in the _ individual _ qsos in this sample .",
    "however , the spectral hardening ( where @xmath10 ) that appears to exist for the sample as a whole above 3  kev , is consistent with reflection from 2@xmath31 steradians of optically thick matter , located out of the line of sight .",
    "past studies ( e.g. , with _",
    "asca _ , rt00 ) have noted that the strength of the neutral compton reflection hump , and the associated iron k@xmath38 line , is considerably lower in the higher - redshift qsos , than that expected in seyfert 1 galaxies at low redshift ( e.g. , nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "however , the qso spectra previously obtained above z  =  2 by _ asca _ were dominated by core - dominated radio - loud quasars , where a contribution from the relativistic jet could weaken any apparent reflection features .",
    "this does not appear to be the case for the _ radio - quiet _ agn found in this sample ; the average co - added spectra of these agn above z  =  2 appears to indicate the presence of a reflection component with r  @xmath1  1 , the first time this has been observed for high - redshift qsos .",
    "such a reflection component could naturally arise from x - rays scattering off optically thick material , such as the inner accretion disc , subtending @xmath39 steradians to the x - ray source .",
    "another possible contribution is by reflection off a distant molecular torus , predicted from agn unification schemes .",
    "we note here that such a component may account for the ` narrow ' iron k@xmath38 lines observed by _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ in bright , nearby agn ( e.g. , kaspi 2001 ; obrien 2001a ) .",
    "finally we note the possibility that the reflection may occur from an ionised disc ( e.g. , reeves 1997 ; eracleous & halpern 1998 ; grandi 2001 ; ballantyne , ross & fabian 2002 ) .",
    "however , the data in this paper show only one significant iron line , located near 6.6  kev ; this tentatively suggests that the reprocessing material might be more strongly ionised in some of the higher luminosity agn , as is observed for instance in the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum of mrk   205 ( reeves 2001 ) .",
    "such an ionised disc could also explain some of the observed spectral curvature ( e.g. , obrien 2001b ; pounds 2001 ) .",
    "analysing 23 radio - quiet qsos , with a mean redshift of 1.40 and 210  kev luminosity of 9.66  @xmath14  erg  s@xmath3 , we have found the following :    * the 210  kev spectral slopes measured for this sample show a significant scatter .",
    "however there is no obvious trend with redshift , so it can be concluded that there is no evidence for x - ray spectral evolution of qsos with redshift or luminosity * the mean value for @xmath5 is measured to be @xmath01.66  @xmath4  0.04 . within the sample there is no correlation with redshift , although comparison with both lower and higher redshift samples indicates a slight steepening as z increases . *",
    "the dispersion in photon index is intrinsic ; that is , it is not related to obscuration , as is thought to be the case for the faint sources constituting x - ray background .",
    "* no excess absorption in the rest frame of the radio - quiet qsos is found .",
    "this is in contrast to the additional n@xmath19 measured by past studies in high - z radio - loud quasars and suggests an intrinsic difference could exist in the local environments of the two classes of qso .",
    "* considering the sample as a whole , the spectral slope appears to flatten at higher energies ( above 3 kev ) .",
    "this indicates the presence of a reflection component from material subtending a solid angle of 2@xmath31 steradians to the x - ray source . this matter could arise from either the inner accretion disc or a distant ( @xmath71  pc ) molecular torus",
    "the work in this paper is based on observations with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission , with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa and nasa .",

    "<S> the x - ray spectra of serendipitously observed agn in the _ xmm - newton _ fields of mrk  205 and qso  0130@xmath0403 are analysed . </S>",
    "<S> the sample consists of 23 objects , none of which is detected at radio frequencies , with a median x - ray luminosity of @xmath14@xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 and redshifts ranging from @xmath10.1 to just over 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean photon index was found to be 1.89  @xmath4  0.04 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to past _ asca _ and _ rosat _ observations of high - redshift radio - loud quasars , we find little evidence for excess intrinsic absorption in these radio - quiet objects , with only three sources requiring a column density in excess of the galactic value . comparing the measured spectral indices over the redshift range , we also find there is no x - ray spectral evolution of qsos with time , up to redshift 3 . within the sample </S>",
    "<S> there is no evidence for evolution of the optical to x - ray spectral index , @xmath5 , with redshift , the mean value being @xmath01.66  @xmath4  0.04 . </S>",
    "<S> however , upon comparing the values from the bright quasar survey at low redshift ( z  @xmath6  0.5 ) and high redshift qsos detected by chandra ( z  @xmath7  4 ) , a slight steepening of @xmath5 is noted for the more distant objects . in most of the sources </S>",
    "<S> there is no significant requirement for a soft excess , although a weak thermal component ( @xmath810  per  cent of l@xmath9 ) can not be excluded . </S>",
    "<S> there is an indication of spectral flattening ( by @xmath10 ) at higher energies ( @xmath11 kev , qso rest frame ) for the sample as a whole . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the presence of a compton reflection component in these radio - quiet agn , with the scattering medium ( such as an accretion disc or molecular torus ) occupying a solid angle of @xmath12 steradians to the x - ray source .    </S>",
