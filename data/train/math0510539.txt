    "we will first construct a topological polynomial @xmath33 satisfying @xmath41 for all @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for all critical points @xmath44 .",

    "we will show that @xmath0 has at least @xmath3 zeros . together with the result from @xcite",
    ", this shows that it has exactly @xmath3 zeros .",
    "first we observe that @xmath1 has no degenerate fixed points , i.e.  all fixed points of @xmath75 satisfy @xmath76 .",
    "( for holomorphic maps , a fixed point is degenerate if the derivative is exactly 1 , for anti - holomorphic maps it is degenerate whenever the derivative has modulus 1 . )",
    "if this were the case , then @xmath77 would have a parabolic fixed point , which would have a critical point in its attracting basin .",
    "however , all critical points of this maps are mapped to the critical points of @xmath1 and those are fixed .",
    "having only non - degenerate fixed points , the sum of the lefschetz indices of the fixed points in the riemann sphere has to be equal to @xmath78 , as the induced maps on 0- and 2-dimensional homology are the identity and multiplication by @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "it already has super - attracting fixed points at @xmath59 and @xmath80 .",
    "the lefschetz index of a super - attracting fixed point is @xmath81 , thus the sum of the indices of all those fixed points is @xmath4 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath1 must have at least @xmath82 fixed points with index @xmath83 , i.e. repelling fixed points for @xmath60 .",
    "this proves sharpness .",
    "we will use results about hubbard trees by poirier ( see @xcite and @xcite ) in order prove theorem [ countingthm ] .",
    "hubbard trees were first introduced in @xcite in order to classify post - critically finite polynomials without periodic critical points . in that case",
    "the julia set is a dendrite , and the hubbard tree is the embedded subtree of the julia set spanned by the post - critical set .",
    "it has a finite number of vertices and edges .",
    "the polynomial induces a map on the tree , and conversely an embedded finite tree with a map satisfying certain conditions gives rise to a post - critically finite polynomial , unique up to affine conjugation .",
    "poirier generalized this to include the case of post - critically finite polynomials with critical periodic points . in this case",
    "all fatou components are simply connected with a distinguished base point , the unique preperiodic point in the component .",
    "the hubbard tree in this case intersects both the julia and the fatou set , and the part in a fatou set consists of preimages of radial lines under the riemann map mapping the component to the unit disk and the basepoint to 0 .",
    "this construction determines an angle between any two edges meeting at a point in the fatou set . the important information needed to reconstruct the map from the ( marked ) tree is the local degree at every vertex , the angles between any two edges meeting at a fatou vertex , and the mapping on vertices .",
    "there is no well - defined angle between edges meeting at points in the julia set , but there is a well - defined cyclic order , and we define the `` angles '' between the edges to be all the same . in that way we end up with an angle function on the tree defined for any pair of incident edges .",
    "an abstract hubbard tree is a finite tree embedded in the plane , together with a mapping @xmath84 on the vertices , a local degree function @xmath85 on the vertices , and an angle function @xmath86 defined for any pair of incident edges @xmath87 .",
    "it has to satisfy @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 whenever @xmath91 meet at a vertex .",
    "the map @xmath92 satisfies @xmath93 whenever @xmath94 and @xmath95 are adjacent vertices . in this way",
    "@xmath92 induces a mapping on the edges , mapping the edge @xmath96 $ ] homeomorphically to the unique path between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , i.e.  mapping an edge to a union of edges . if two edges @xmath99 and @xmath100 meet at @xmath94 , then @xmath101 and @xmath102 meet at @xmath97 , and we require that @xmath103 , which is just the fact that holomorphic maps of local degree @xmath104 multiply angles by @xmath104 .",
    "a vertex is a fatou vertex if it eventually lands in a periodic vertex @xmath94 with @xmath105 .",
    "all other vertices are julia vertices .",
    "the last and not quite as obvious requirement for the hubbard tree is that @xmath92 is expanding , i.e.  whenever @xmath94 and @xmath95 are adjacent julia vertices , there exists @xmath4 such that @xmath106 and @xmath107 are not adjacent .",
    "the _ degree _ of the hubbard tree is @xmath108 .",
    "poirier s main result in @xcite is that any such abstract hubbard tree corresponds to a polynomial of degree @xmath109 , unique up to affine conjugation .",
    "the uniqueness part easily implies that any symmetries of the hubbard tree correspond to symmetries of the polynomial .",
    "proof of theorem [ countingthm ] .",
    "we will first prove the result about the number of conjugacy classes . by poirier s",
    "theorem we only have to count the number of corresponding hubbard trees up to symmetry .",
    "we will first establish some general properties of the corresponding hubbard trees , after which we will treat odd and even degrees separately .",
    "the following claim gives a complete characterization of the hubbard trees in question , the rest of the argument is counting .    the induced map on the hubbard tree is @xmath110 .",
    "the only vertices in the hubbard tree are the critical points .",
    "all angles are @xmath111 or @xmath112 .",
    "conversely , any finite tree @xmath13 which is symmetric with respect to complex conjugation , has local degree @xmath113 at every vertex , with the map @xmath114 , @xmath115 , arises as a hubbard tree of a polynomial satisfying the requirements in theorem [ countingthm ] .",
    "let @xmath116 and @xmath117 be critical points such that the path @xmath118 between them does not contain any other critical point . then @xmath118 will be mapped homeomorphically to the path connecting @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which is the complex conjugate of @xmath118 .",
    "since the whole post - critical set consists of critical points , this argument covers the whole hubbard tree .",
    "any non - critical vertices would have to be branch points , and the induced map @xmath110 reverses the cyclic order of edges at branch points , contradicting the fact that @xmath1 is locally conformal at all non - critical vertices .",
    "finally , let @xmath121 and @xmath122 be two edges meeting at a critical vertex @xmath123 .",
    "then @xmath124 , and @xmath125 in @xmath126 , thus @xmath127 .",
    "conversely , if all local degrees are 2 , and all angles are @xmath111 or @xmath112 , complex conjugation @xmath115 satisfies @xmath128 for any two edges meeting at a vertex @xmath94 .",
    "the property that @xmath33 on the tree @xmath13 be expanding is trivially satisfied as there are no julia vertices at all .",
    "@xmath129-symmetric hubbard trees give rise to @xmath129-symmetric polynomials , so this shows the last part of the claim .      remark .",
    "the bijective correspondence replaces the vertical edge which intersects the real line by a horizontal edge which is a real interval .",
    "see figure [ figtrees ] for examples of hubbard trees up to degree 8 .    proof .",
    "let @xmath116 and @xmath117 be real critical points .",
    "since the hubbard tree is a tree symmetric with respect to the real line , the subtree spanned by @xmath116 and @xmath117 has to be the real interval between them .",
    "since no angle in the hubbard tree is @xmath130 , there can be no other vertex in that interval , i.e.  there can not be other critical points between @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "this shows the first claim . in order to construct the bijective correspondence ,",
    "we only need to give the modification of the tree in the upper halfplane .",
    "the part in the lower halfplane is determined by symmetry and the map on the tree is always complex conjugation .",
    "if there are two real critical points @xmath131 , let @xmath132 and @xmath133 be the subtrees in the upper halfplane attached at @xmath116 and @xmath117 , resp .",
    "the correspondence is given by replacing the edge @xmath134 $ ] by @xmath135 $ ] , and attaching @xmath132 and @xmath133 to the left and right of @xmath136 , resp .",
    ", so that @xmath137 .",
    "the inverse of this operation is given by replacing the edge which crosses the real line by a real interval and attaching the left and right subtrees at the endpoints of this interval , again with angles @xmath111 .",
    "observe also that any symmetry with respect to the imaginary axis will be preserved by this correspondence and its inverse .",
    "it remains to count the hubbard trees .",
    "let us start with the easier case of even degree @xmath65 with @xmath139 .",
    "here we have an odd number of critical points , so by claim 2 there is exactly one real critical point @xmath116 .",
    "the number of edges meeting at this point must be even by symmetry . in the case",
    "@xmath140 , there is only one critical point , so there are no edges . in all other",
    "cases the number of edges meeting at @xmath141 must be @xmath113 , since it can be at most 3 by claim 1 . also the angles between the real axis and the edges must be @xmath142 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "there are exactly two choices , and they correspond to each other under the symmetry @xmath143 .",
    "since we count hubbard trees up to symmetry , we may fix an orientation .",
    "it also follows that all those hubbard trees have no rotational symmetry .",
    "we can view the part of the tree in the upper halfplane as a finite part of an infinite rooted binary tree . the number of vertices , excluding the root , is @xmath24 , and it is well - known ( and easy to proof from the recursive formula @xmath144 ) that there are @xmath145 of those .",
    "in the case of odd degree @xmath45 there are @xmath146 critical points .",
    "let us count the number of trees which have no vertex on the real line .",
    "then the part in the upper halfplane is again a finite part of a rooted binary tree with @xmath24 vertices , so there are @xmath147 of those .",
    "however , for every such tree the image under @xmath143 has the same form . if @xmath148 , this implies that there are @xmath149 up to symmetry .",
    "however , if @xmath150 , there are trees which are symmetric under @xmath143",
    ". the number of those corresponds to the number of subtrees with @xmath151 vertices attached to the right of the first vertex in the upper halfplane .",
    "this means that there are @xmath152 symmetric trees , so we have @xmath153 inequivalent hubbard trees in this case . by claim 2",
    ", we have the same number of trees with 2 vertices on the real line , so the number of inequivalent hubbard trees is @xmath154 for @xmath155 and @xmath156 for @xmath26 .",
    "let us now count the number of equivalence classes .",
    "the equivalence of two solutions @xmath1 and @xmath12 implies the existence of affine linear maps @xmath15 and @xmath13 with @xmath157 ,",
    "i.e.  the existence of an affine map @xmath158 such that @xmath159 maps the critical points of @xmath12 to itself . in particular this implies that @xmath160 is again a solution",
    ". the only rotations @xmath159 which map one of our symmetric hubbard trees to a symmetric hubbard tree are @xmath161 with @xmath162 . in the case",
    "@xmath163 , the map @xmath164 has the same underlying hubbard tree as @xmath12 with the map @xmath165 on it .",
    "this corresponds to the hubbard tree of @xmath12 rotated by 90 degrees with complex conjugation as the map .",
    "this can only happen if @xmath26 , and the number of trees which admit this is @xmath152 .",
    "the case @xmath166 can actually not occur , since the map @xmath164 would have the same hubbard tree and the map on it would be reflection in the line @xmath167 .",
    "however , none of the hubbard trees has one of those lines as a line of symmetry .    combining all this ,",
    "the number of equivalence classes is the same as the number of conjugacy classes except in the case @xmath26 , where it becomes @xmath168 .",
    "thus the number of equivalence classes is @xmath169 for all @xmath4 .",
