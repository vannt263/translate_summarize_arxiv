    "the ground state energy was obtained as a value of the ep at @xmath66 and excitation energies were determined as zeros of appropriate green s functions .",
    "a comparison with the exact spectrum of the ao shows that the convergence of the 2ppi expansion is the best for the ground state . for excited states",
    "the critical value above which the expansion converges to the exact result is greater .",
    "the higher excitation , the larger critical value , and the region of applicability of the approximation diminishes .",
    "this is similar as in the perturbation theory ; however , the region of applicability of the 2ppi expansion is much larger for all energy levels .",
    "the numerical results of the 2ppi approach for the lowest excitations up to second order are very similar to that obtained in the optimized expansion and the large n expansion to the same order  @xcite . even to this order ,",
    "the calculations in the later methods are not as straightforward as in the 2ppi expansion , since @xmath37 can not be derived directly . in higher orders the optimized and large n expansion would become even more complicated , requiring to solve a gap equation of bethe - salpeter type . with the use of the cornwall - jackiw - tomboulis ea for bilocal composite operators the situation would be very much the same .",
    "therefore , the ea for local composite operators provides the simplest method to study the ground state and the lowest excitations in the case of the ao .",
