    "sgr b2 was observed over the wavelength range 47197  @xmath0 m in a full and unbiased spectral survey using the infrared space observatory long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) .",
    "a spectral resolution of 3040  km  s@xmath6 was achieved across this range using the instrument in its fabry - prot mode , l03 .",
    "lines observed in the survey include rotational transitions of molecules ( e.g. oh , h@xmath7o , h@xmath8o@xmath9 , nh , nh@xmath7 , nh@xmath8 , ch ) as well as atomic fine structure lines ( e.g. [ oi ] , [ oiii ] , [ cii ] , [ nii ] , [ niii ] ) .",
    "all of the low lying rotational transitions of oh were covered by the survey .",
    "sgr  b2 is a giant molecular cloud complex , located close to the galactic centre .",
    "it emits a strong far - infrared ( fir ) continuum spectrum with a peak near 80  @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "this is a perfect background against which to observe line of sight absorption features .",
    "we detected several @xmath1oh transitions as well as one @xmath3oh transition .",
    "each line shows two resolved @xmath10-doublet components .",
    "figure  [ obs_lev ] shows the detected rotational transitions .",
    "transitions from the lowest level show absorption due to the whole line of sight in the range @xmath11  km  s@xmath6 to @xmath12  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "this is due to galactic spiral arm clouds located between the sun and galactic centre @xcite .",
    "higher transitions are only seen at the velocity of sgr b2 itself ( @xmath13 + 65  km  s@xmath6 ; @xcite ) and these have been modelled by @xcite .",
    "oh ( left ) and @xmath3oh ( right ) shown with their rotational levels .",
    "the @xmath14 value of each level is indicated .",
    "the two resolved @xmath10-components have been averaged together for each transition except at 79  @xmath0m.,height=226 ]",
    "we modelled the observed shape of the @xmath1oh and @xmath3oh ground state lines at 79  @xmath0 m , 53  @xmath0 m and 120  @xmath0 m accounting for 10 line of sight features .",
    "we used hi 21 cm absorption measurements from @xcite as the basis for the model to give velocities and line widths for each feature . in the model",
    "we adjust optical depths and @xmath1oh/@xmath3oh ratios to simultaneously fit the three lines .",
    "the highest column density is associated with sgr b2 at @xmath15  km  s@xmath16 : n(@xmath1oh)@xmath17  @xmath18 and n(@xmath3oh)@xmath19  @xmath18 .",
    "two hi clouds show very little oh ( @xmath20  km  s@xmath6 & @xmath21  km  s@xmath6 ) but in the remaining line of sight clouds the average column densities are : n(@xmath1oh)@xmath22  @xmath18 and n(@xmath3oh)@xmath23  @xmath18 .",
    "measurements of isotopic ratios through the galaxy probe its chemical evolution as they are determined by stellar processing and outflow mechanisms .",
    "@xmath1o is a primary product of stellar nucleosynthesis , produced directly from the primordial elements h and he , whereas @xmath2o and @xmath3o are secondary products which require heavier elements from previous nuclear burning for their production ( see e.g. @xcite ) . due to the higher stellar processing rates towards the galactic centre ,",
    "the @xmath1o/@xmath3o ratio is expected to be lower there than in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the rotational transitions of oh are a particularly good tracer for the oxygen isotope ratio @xmath1o/@xmath3o because there are no efficient chemical reactions causing isotopic fractionation that would change @xmath1oh/@xmath3oh from the true value @xcite . also , the transitions in both @xmath1oh and @xmath3oh are optically thin for line of sight clouds and in these clouds the ground state lines are a good measure of the total column density ( absorption from higher levels is not observed )",
    ".    most previous measurements of this ratio have been determined from radio lines using h@xmath24c@xmath1o / h@xmath25c@xmath3o @xcite .",
    "this a double ratio with @xmath4c/@xmath5c to avoid optically thick transitions .",
    "the fir lines of oh provide an important test of these values with a different molecule in a different wavelength regime and without reference to @xmath4c/@xmath5c ( which is subject to fractionation effects ) .",

    "@xmath2oh was also detected in the survey via its lowest energy rotational transition , the first detection of this line in the ism @xcite .",
    "this transition is interesting because the @xmath2o nucleus has non - zero spin and so causes extra splitting into hyperfine components spread over @xmath2680  km  s@xmath6 , modifying the line shape .",
    "the observed absorption is greater than predicted using the solar system @xmath3o/@xmath2o ratio ( 5.2 ) and at the velocity of sgr b2 it is consistent with previous measurements of @xmath3o/@xmath2o through the galaxy ( @xmath263.5 @xcite ) - see fig .",
