    "in 1978 , considering the mass operator of the electron in the constant homogeneous em field , v.  ritus @xcite found the field - dependent correction to the mass of the electron , which in the weak - field limit @xmath0 ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 - the electric field ) takes the form : , @xmath3 .",
    "fine structure constant @xmath4 . ]",
    "@xmath5 . \\eqno{(1)}\\ ] ] here @xmath6 and we have omitted the quantum corrections of orders @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the leading terms in the real and imaginary parts of the mass shift ( ms ) , as it can be deduced from ( 1 ) , are purely classical .",
    "( `` photon mass '' ) should be interpreted as a minimal wave number @xmath9 of radiating quanta @xcite . ] subsequently , ritus @xcite suggested a method of calculation of the ms ( 1 ) which relies , entirely , on a classical quantity @xmath10 @xmath11 is the change in the self - action of the charge caused by the external field . the overdots in ( 2 ) denote the derivatives of the world line @xmath12 w.r.t . the proper time .    in the constant homogeneous field the self - action ( 2 ) determines the ms according to @xmath13 where the proper time interval @xmath14 of the motion ( in external field ) is much greater than the formation time of @xmath15 .",
    "the green s function @xmath16 in ( 2 ) is the causal one and , consequently , @xmath11 is in general the complex quantity .",
    "the next important point is the presence of the subtraction @xmath17 which manifests the fact that all self - action effects taken at zero external field should be accounted for by the definition of the observable mass of the charge .",
    "this means that no uv divergences should appear in ( 2 ) .    to interpret @xmath18 in the context of classical electrodynamics @xcite ( ced )",
    "one ought to remind the connection between the latter and the spectral function of radiation , @xmath19 produced by the classical source ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath20    the quantity @xmath21 appears in qed as well in the form of an amplitude of the preservation of the photon vacuum in the presence of the classical source ( 5 ) , so that the imaginary part of @xmath11 determines the corresponding probability @xcite : @xmath22 this probability is less than unity if the particle radiates .",
    "the consideration of the radiation reaction effects through the non - local reparametrization invariant functional ( 2 ) could bring the information which is supplementary to one obtained from abraham - lorentz - dirac ( ald ) equation .",
    "let us list some known applications of the formula ( 2 ) ( this applications , certainly , are not restricted with the case of constant electric field ) :    the self - energy of the charged particle rest in a proximity to the charged black hole .",
    "ms determines a repulsive force acting on this particle @xcite ; the real part of @xmath15 in ( 1 ) determines ( at @xmath0 ) the correction to the classical action in the exponential of barrier factor .",
    "this results @xcite in 2-loop radiative correction to schwinger pair creation rate ;    the classical radiative corrections to the cyclotron motion of the electron near a boundary @xcite .",
    "those were in the focus of attention in connection with the apparatus - dependent effects in @xmath23 experiments of washington group @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that in the second example the result could not be deduced from ald equation in view of infrared origin of the real part of the ms @xcite .",
    "here we consider the ms of the uniformly accelerated ( ua ) charge radiating vector ( that is em ) or scalar field ( electric or scalar charge for brevity ) and moving in the space - time of arbitrary dimensions @xmath24 .",
    "for @xmath25 this type of motion is distinguished by zero radiation reaction force , so that the world line @xmath26 of ua charge is an exact solution of the ald equation . at that time one",
    "finds ( see @xcite ) that the value @xmath25 is in a sense singular for the existence of the ald - type equation .",
    "we find the corresponding pecularities for the ms as well .    to begin with we remind one remarkable similarity ( @xmath25 ) between the mass shifts of electric charge considering at two different situations .",
    "a)the self - field is massive ( see ( 1)-(3 ) ) , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 are expressed @xcite through the bilinear combinations of bessel functions , @xmath30 is an acceleration in the rest frame of the charge and parameter @xmath31 from ( 1 ) is @xmath32 ) ; b ) the self - field is massless but the charge is moving parallel to and a distance @xmath33 apart from the perfect mirror , @xmath34 ( euler s constant is used here to fix the correspondence between @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the ir limit ) .",
    "the function @xmath37 is an elementary one @xcite : @xmath38 the correspondence mentioned above , @xmath39 is fulfilled ( as it can be seen from the fig.1 ) in the wide interval @xmath40 despite that only in the ir region @xmath41 the asymptotics of @xmath42 and @xmath37 are expected to be in common ( for real parts , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , this similarity extends over the whole positive axis ) .    for the scalar ua source we have the same correspondence ( 10 ) between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( fig.1b )",
    "the ir limit of those functions is distinct from ( 1 ) @xcite : @xmath47 now , in addition to abovementioned motivation it is interesting to consider the ms @xmath48 and @xmath49 as a functions of another ir regulator ( the latter being now @xmath50 ) .",
    "we need usual dimensional generalization of @xmath16 in the self - action ( 2 ) for @xmath51 and introduce mass scale @xmath52 . now",
    "the source ( 5 ) has the charge ( @xmath53dimensionless constant ) @xmath54 and @xmath24-dimensional @xmath55-function is implied there .",
    "the simple calculations along the lines of the work @xcite result in the expression : @xmath56 the corresponding formula for the @xmath49 could be obtained from ( 14 ) by the substitution @xmath57 in place of @xmath58 ( @xmath59 s are the mcdonald functions ) .",
    "the integral in ( 14 ) is transformed with the help of 2.16.6(5 ) in @xcite , that gives the final expressions : @xmath60 @xmath61 at @xmath62 one finds @xmath63 } , \\eqno{(17)}\\ ] ] and @xmath49 in the same limit is precisely ( 12 ) . with the correspondence @xmath64 expression ( 17 )",
    "can be easily reconciled with ( 1 ) .",
    "the following properties are characteristic of the ms ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) : i)the real part of @xmath48 in ( 17 ) appears in tandem with the ir singularity @xmath65 present in ( 15 ) , precisely as it were for the ms ( 7 ) and ( 8) ; ii ) the real parts @xmath66 and @xmath67 do not appear for even dimensions @xmath68 ; iii ) for odd @xmath69 the real parts @xmath66 and @xmath67 are divergent , while imaginary ones are finite .",
    "this should be juxtaposed with the absence of the huygence principle in odd - dimensional space - times .",
    "for the non - relativistic cyclotron motion in magnetic field ( @xmath25 below ) one knows an exact solution of the ald equation , @xmath70 where the following notations have been introduced : @xmath71 we shall discuss only the plane motion of the charge .",
    "the non - relativistic cyclotron frequency @xmath72 describes unperturbed motion without radiation damping , present as the second term in the l.h.s . of ( 18 ) .",
    "physically acceptable ( and exact ) solution of ( 18 ) was found in @xcite and looks like @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75= -\\frac{\\omega_c^2}{b}+\\dots}\\,\\ , .",
    "\\eqno{(22)}\\ ] ] note , that real and imaginary parts of @xmath76 are represented here as an infinite series in radiative constant @xmath77 and that @xmath78 is negative ( this property corresponds to the dissipation of the energy and to the shrinkage of the cyclotron orbit ) .",
    "ms for the plane cyclotron motion was found in the aforementioned ritus s",
    "work @xcite and is purely imaginary quantity : ( 2 ) is computed for the unperturbed cyclotron world line . ]",
    "@xmath79 now we shall exploit the dependence of @xmath15 on the integral @xmath80 of the unperturbed motion .",
    "the first order correction to lagrange function in laboratory system , @xmath81 , in non relativistic regime takes the form : @xmath82 where the first - order ( in @xmath83 ) radiative correction to the mass , @xmath84 ( @xmath85 should not be confused with @xmath15 : having different physical meaning , they differ in sign ) .",
    "we postulate that the correction up to the second order must be determined by the same principle , but with @xmath86 substituted in place of m in ( 25 ) .",
    "application of this procedure _ ad infinitum _ gives us the equation for the complete radiative mass - correction @xmath87 it could be easily checked that the `` new '' cyclotron frequency @xmath88 is just the @xmath76 from ( 21 ) , ( 22 ) : @xmath89 qualitatively , this coincidence is not surprising : radiation effects , when properly accounted , must entail in dynamics .",
    "really unexpected is quantitative correspondence between formulas ( 27 ) and ( 21 ) , ( 22 ) .",
    "so , one should ask about the foundation of such `` empirical '' perturbative approach .",
    "as it seems now the main points are the following : i ) the structure of the radiative correction ( 24 ) to lagrange function ( or energy ) is just the one of the `` bare '' lagrangian .",
    "@xmath85 does not contain dynamical variables , so that the relation ( 25 ) is independent of the concrete conditions of the cyclotron motion ; ii ) the constancy of the field which makes going from non - local @xmath11 to the ms possible ; iii ) two dimensional character of the unperturbed motion is not destroyed by radiation ; the latter does give the better conditions for the applicability of the non - relativistic approximation .",
    "could one hope to use this renormalisation method as a general tool for solving ald equation ?",
    "it does not seem so because there is no universal dimensionless parameter in ced which would govern the radiation effects .",
    "qed does have such a parameter which is the fine structure constant .",
    "several reasons make this topic interesting : i ) considerable recent attention to the pseudoclassical models which stems from the close relations between those models and string theory ; ii ) with rare exception , the problem of back - reaction effects have not been considering in those models ; iii ) it is desirable to endow the spinning particles models with a quasiclassical status -in the same sense as one uses the bmt equation ( which does not include back reaction ) . for example , there is still a need in adequate quasiclassical interpretation of the radiation polarization phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the self field of the charged particle possessing the magnetic moment @xmath52 ( @xmath90 ) satisfies the equation @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the source ( 5 ) , and @xmath93 is the polarization density . the dependence of @xmath94 on @xmath95 is determined from the lorentz and bmt equations @xcite : @xmath96 ( we put g=2 for simplicity ) .",
    "the self - action obtained from ( 2 ) by substitution @xmath97 , can be decomposed into the following terms : @xmath98 where `` orbit '' part is precisely @xmath11 in ( 2 ) , and `` spin - orbit '' and `` spin - spin '' terms are : @xmath99 @xmath100    for the constant homogeneous magnetic field the ms is expressed through the geometrical invariants of the world line , the latter being curvature @xmath101 and the first torsion @xmath102 ( the second one is equal to zero for the plane motion ) : @xmath103 without going into details , we give the final expression for the @xmath104 term in ( 33 ) regarding the latter as a major contribution between two terms ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) in the decomposition ( 32 ) : @xmath105 here @xmath106 is @xmath107-component of spin ( in @xmath108 units ) , and the formfactor @xmath109 includes relativistic retardation effects .",
    "it is obtained from ( 33 ) ( where ir regulator @xmath110 could be omitted ) : @xmath111 ^ 2}\\ , .",
    "\\eqno{(37)}\\ ] ] following asymptotic expressions are obtainable from the representation ( 37 ) : @xmath112 comparing it with the ultrarelativistic behaviour of function @xmath113 introduced in ( 23 ) , @xmath114 , we can conclude about the notable growth of the spin effects relative to orbit ones in the ultrarelativistic region @xmath115 : @xmath116 here @xmath117 and we put @xmath118 ( see ( 23 ) and ( 36 ) ) .",
