    "quantum optics has advanced to the stage of experimental measurement and manipulation of individual quantum systems in single quanta level @xcite , where the light - matter interaction plays an important role .",
    "considerable interest has been generated in exploring new mechanisms that enable efficient control of the light - matter interaction . in past years , with the sufficient reduction of the effective mode volume for photons , strong and even ultrastrong light - matter interaction have been experimentally realized @xcite .",
    "recently , a scheme exploiting the mesoscopic characteristics of quantum dots ( qds ) was proposed @xcite , by means of which the plasmon - matter interaction @xcite can be strongly modified .",
    "the light - matter interaction is generally described under the dipole approximation ( da ) , which works well in atomic systems where the variation of the field is negligible within the atomic spatial extension @xcite . however , once the spatial variation of the field becomes pronounced , such as the surface plasmons triggered by the radiation field of the quantum emitter @xcite , and the emitter is spatially extended , such as a qd several tens of nanometers in size @xcite , the validity of the da is not clear _ a priori_. experimentally , a large deviation from the dipole theory was observed for qds in close proximity to a silver mirror @xcite .",
    "the optical response of quantum nanosystems beyond the long - wavelength approximation ( equivalent to the da ) has been studied semiclassically @xcite , which indicated that the nonlocal spatial interplay between the wave functions of the qd exciton and the electromagnetic field makes the da invalid .",
    "unconventional phenomena exceeding the da have been found , such as the selection - rule breakdown of an isolated single - walled carbon nanotube in a nanogap @xcite , entangled - photon generation from biexcitons in a semiconductor film @xcite , and enhanced up - conversion of entangled photons in nanostructures @xcite . in the fully quantum theory , making taylor expansion of the field spatial distribution function to the first order , it is found that the nonlocal interaction is described by the quadrupole moment , and a microscopic picture of it from a circular quantum current density flowing along a curved path inside the qd has been provided @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as the quadrupole moment can be tuned by controlling the size and shape of the qd @xcite , it has potential applications in the development of a nanophotonic devices . for the requirement of developing nanoplasmonic single - photon source ,",
    "a study on the fluorescence from a resonantly driven qd , especially the second - order correlation property of the fluorescence , modified by the mesoscopic characteristics is necessary and important .    in this work ,",
    "we study the resonance fluorescence of a mesoscopic qd in different spatial orientations placed near a plasmonic nanostructure . going beyond the da",
    ", a microscopic description to the power spectrum and the second - order correlation property of the qd fluorescence is established .",
    "the substantial deviations from the dipole theory are found when the qd is positioned within the penetration depth of the plasmons into the dielectric .",
    "it is revealed that the spatial rotation symmetry for the resonance fluorescence spectrum over the qd orientation is changed from @xmath0 under the da to @xmath1 due to the interference of the emission from the dipole and the quadrupole moments .",
    "the widths and intensities of the spectral peaks differ dramatically from those under the da due to the cooperative actions of the dipole and quadrupole moments .",
    "explicitly , by exploiting the qd mesoscopic effects , the spectrum can be switched between a single peak and the mollow triplet .",
    "the analysis on the second - order correlation property indicates that , keeping the nonclassical antibunching nature , the fluorescence can be changed from the weak to the strong emission regime by increasing the quadrupole moment .",
    "this opens an avenue to develop nanophotonic single - photon devices by use of the qd mesoscopic characters .",
    "our parameter values are all experimentally attainable .",

    "it can be obtained by solving the maxwell - helmholtz wave equation @xmath21\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime } ; \\omega ) = \\mathbf{i}\\delta ( \\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime } ) $ ] , where @xmath22 is identity matrix . for general geometries ,",
    "the solving needs some numerical methods , such as the finite difference time domain and the finite element methods @xcite . for symmetric geometries such as spheres , cylinders , or planes ,",

    "@xmath17 in the upper half - space of the metal - dielectric interface is calculated as the sum of the free - space and reflected green s tensors @xmath23 .",
    "see more details in appendix [ green ] .",
    "three distinct modes are triggered by the emission of the qd .",
    "the first one is the radiative modes propagating into the free space .",
    "the second one is the damped non - radiative mode due to the ohmic loss in the metal .",
    "the last one is the tightly confined field called surface plasmon propagating along the metal surface @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic modes associated with the surface plasmon enable strong confinement of light on the surface and thus enhance the light - matter interaction , which has inspired great interests in studying surface plasmon subwavelength optics and quantum plasmonics @xcite .",
    "in addition , due to the exponential decay of the intensity of the electromagnetic field perpendicular to the metal surface , its variation along this direction is pronounced within the spatial extension of the qds .",
    "it causes the breakdown of the da .",
    "thus a new theory in describing light - matter interaction beyond the da is necessary .",
    "the qd - field interaction is described by the minimal coupling hamiltonian @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the momentum operator , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the electronic charge and mass , respectively , and @xmath28 is the vector potential of the field @xcite . in quantization , @xmath28 is expanded as @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30 relevant to the green s tensor is the field spatial distribution function , @xmath31 is the annihilation operator with frequency @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the vacuum dielectric function , and @xmath34 is the combined index of the wave vector @xmath35 and polarization @xmath36 . to go beyond the da , we make a taylor expansion of @xmath37 to the first order around the qd center @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the jacobian matrix of partial derivatives of @xmath40 .",
    "the qd in the strong confinement regime can be well described by a two - band model with states @xmath41 and @xmath42 representing an electron and a hole in the conduction and heavy valence band , respectively @xcite . employing the rotating wave approximation",
    ", we arrive at the interaction hamiltonian beyond the da in the interaction picture @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the frequency detuning .",

    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ couple ] ) that both the dipole and quadrupole moments contribute to its interaction with the radiation field .",
    "the former couples to the field distribution function @xmath30 , while the latter couples to the gradient of @xmath30 . in atomic systems , the atom is much smaller than the wavelength and the typical length of the spatial distribution of the field , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "thus the contributions from the quadrupole moment can be safely abandoned and the da is applicable . however , in the qd system , as the qd is large in size and the spatial variation of the field is pronounced , they can not be ignored and the da is inapplicable .",
    "the interaction between the qd and the field is further characterized by the spectral density @xmath55 . combined with eq .",

    "up to now , going beyond the da , we have analytically established the microscopic description to the interaction between the qd and the radiation field propagating near a plasmonic nanostructure .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath86 is contributed from two types of field modes along the @xmath5-direction by dividing the integration range @xmath87 $ ] of @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ ref ] ) into two intervals @xmath89 $ ] and @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "the former has a real @xmath91 and is associated with the reflected plane waves by the metal - dielectric interface , while the latter has a complex @xmath91 and is associated with the surface plasmons and the damped non - radiative mode @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cooperative effect of the dipole and the quadrupole moments are self - consistently contained in @xmath86 , where the @xmath92 term characterizes the interference between the two moments .",
    "just due to this interference , the decoherence of the qd shows significant differences from the one under the da . under the da ,",
    "the spectral density contributed uniquely from the dipole moment has a @xmath0-rotation symmetry over the qd orientation . when the quadrupole moment is taken into account",
    ", the symmetry is changed into @xmath1 because of the presence of the @xmath93 term .",
    "it is noted that in the special case @xmath94 or @xmath0 , our result reduces exactly to the one in ref .",
    "we consider explicitly that the qd is resonantly driven by a laser so that the resonance fluorescence of the qd near the metal surface beyond the da can be measured . in a frame rotating at the laser frequency @xmath7 ,",

    "fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) we plot @xmath100 in different qd orientations as a function of the qd - interface separation @xmath106 under and beyond the da , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath100 attenuates rapidly at small @xmath107 and tends to a persistent oscillation with the increase of @xmath107 .",
    "this is understandable based on eq .",
    "( [ ref ] ) , which reveals that the contribution from the surface plasmons only dominates the small @xmath98 regime . beyond this regime",
    ", the spectral density originates mainly from reflected plane waves , which shows a lossless oscillation with the increase of @xmath98 .",
    "in addition , the significant deviations to the result under da can be seen at small @xmath98 , where the surface plasmons bounded around the metal surface play a significant role . the typical distance where this deviation is observable is the penetration depth of the plasmons into the dielectric , which takes @xmath108 for our parameters .",
    "therefore , the da is inapplicable especially when the qd is positioned within @xmath109 .",
    "this has been verified experimentally @xcite . a cross section view at @xmath99 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "it indicates clearly that @xmath100 experiences a @xmath0 rotation symmetry over the qd orientation under the da , while it is changed to @xmath1 once the mesoscopic effects are taken into account .",

    "[ fig2](d ) @xmath100 as a function of @xmath110 at @xmath94 and @xmath0 .",
    "it indicates that the interference between the dipole and quadrupole moments can cause a constructive increase or a destructive decrease of the decay rate under the da ( i.e. , the value when @xmath111 ) .",
    "it demonstrates that we can control the qd decay by manipulating the mesoscopic characteristics of the qd , such as its spatial orientation and quadrupole moment .",

    "it consists of the coherent ( rayleigh scattering ) and incoherent ( inelastic scattering ) components .",

    ", the spectrum constitutes of a sum of three lorentzian components centered at @xmath7 and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "this is the typical feature of the mollow s triplet structure . in the weak - driving and strong - radiation situation ( @xmath122 ) ,",
    "the two sideband peaks disappear . furthermore , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ spectrum ] ) , the positions , the widths , and the intensities of the three peaks of the spectrum are all associated with the decay rate @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , the spectrum can be greatly influenced by the mesoscopic effects of the qd via @xmath100 .     in different qd orientations under ( a ) and beyond ( b ) the da .",
    "the parameters are the same as in fig . [ fig2](c ) except for @xmath123 ns@xmath124 . ]     in different @xmath110 for @xmath94 ( a ) and @xmath0 ( b ) .",
    "the parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) except for @xmath123 ns@xmath124 . ]",
    "figures [ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) show the spectrum in different qd orientations under and beyond the da , respectively .",
    "the spectrum under the da has a @xmath0 rotation symmetry over the qd orientation , while beyond the da , it has @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "it agrees with the behavior of @xmath100 , fig . [",
    "fig2](c ) .",
    "another interesting observation is that although the spectrum keeps the mollow triplet structure in the whole range of @xmath64 when the da is applied [ see fig . [ fig3](a ) ] , it can be switched from the mollow triplet to a single peak centered at @xmath125 by adjusting the qd orientation when the mesoscopic effect is considered [ see fig . [ fig3](b ) ] .",
    "this result manifests clearly the anisotropy of the spontaneous emission of the qd placed on the metal surface .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] plots the spectrum with the change of @xmath110 for @xmath94 ( a ) and @xmath0 ( b ) , respectively .",
    "when @xmath94 , the mollow triplet can be either strengthened or weakened with the increasing of @xmath110 , while at @xmath102 , it gradually switches to a single peak with the increase of @xmath110 , which characterizes a strong radiation of the qd .",
    "thus , for the spectrum to be more evident in experiment , a proper designation of the qd orientation and the quadrupole moment is needed .     versus @xmath64 at @xmath126 ( a ) and versus @xmath110 at @xmath94 ( b ) .",
    "parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] . ]",
    "another magnitude of the experimental interest is the statistical properties of the emitted light from the qd @xcite , which is measured by the second - order correlation function @xmath127 with @xmath128 . from eq .",

    "it ensures the single - photon nature of the emitted fluorescence .",
    "we plot @xmath129 in different qd orientations for @xmath126 in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) . the @xmath1 symmetry over the qd orientation is also kept by @xmath129 . in addition , @xmath129 experiences from monotonically increase to oscillatory increase in different @xmath64 .",
    "the oscillation is a manifestation of the laser - driven rabi oscillation , while the damping of its amplitude is caused by the qd spontaneous emission .",
    "the oscillation of @xmath129 in fixed qd orientation can be dramatically suppressed with the increase of the quadrupole moment [ see fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] .",
    "such type of transition can be viewed as a manifestation of the fluorescence changed from the weak radiation to the strong radiation regimes due to the presence of the qd mesoscopic effects @xcite .",
    "both the spectrum and the second - order correlation function of the fluorescence indicate that one can control the single - photon emission of the qd by its mesoscopic effects , e.g. , the spatial orientation and the quadrupole moment .",
    "in summary , we have studied the resonance fluorescence of a mesoscopic qd placed in plasmonic nanostructure .",
    "going beyond the da , a microscopic description of the decoherence dynamics of the qd has been established .",
    "it is revealed that , modified by the qd mesoscopic effects , the spectrum and its statistical property of the resonance fluorescence exhibit different rotation symmetry over the qd orientation and shows significant deviation from those under the da .",
    "the results demonstrate that one can control the interaction between the qd and the surface plasmons by manipulating its mesoscopic effects , which offers a dimension to control the radiation properties of the qd . our studies are within the present experimental state of the art and instructive for the utilization of the qd mesoscopic characteristics in the nanophotonic device developments .",
