    "elucidating the nature of the physics of extremely strong gravity around black holes is one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics in this century . in order to obtain physical information of the strong gravity region in the vicinity of black holes , direct imaging of a black hole is an extremely promising method .",
    "the emission from the vicinity of the event horizon contains information about the physical parameters of a black hole . since the apparent shapes of the black hole shadows and the appearances of the circular orbit around the black hole are deformed by the effects of the black hole s rotation and charge ( e.g. cunningham & bardeen 1972 , 1973 , bardeen 1973 , takahashi 2004 , 2005 , zakharov et al .",
    "2005 ) , the size and the position of the most luminous parts generally existing in the vicinity of the shadow depend on the physical parameters of black holes .    in general , methods for probing strong - field gravity near supermassive black holes or stellar - mass black holes are quite limited . although the past vlbi observations give the images of the galactic centers with the spatial resolution within 100 schwarzschild radii ( e.g. , for sgr a * , shen et al .",
    "2005 , for m87 , junor , biretta & livio 1999 ) , the direct mapping of the shadows of both supermassive and stellar - mass black holes has not been performed so far .",
    "several future interferometers have plans to image the shadows around massive black holes : e.g. vsop-2 for radio ( hirabayashi et al .",
    "2005 ) , maxim for soft x - ray ( see maxim web page : http://maxim.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) .",
    "while these planned interferometers will image the massive black hole , direct imaging of the stellar - mass black holes are difficult because the apparent size of the black hole shadow is extremely small .",
    "for example , in the case of the black hole with 10 solar mass at the distance of 10 pc , the apparent size of the black hole shadow ( @xmath0 5 schwarzschild radii ) is about 0.1 micro - arcsecond .",
    "so , even with the future planned radio or x - ray interferometer , the direct mapping of the shadow of the stellar - mass black hole is practically impossible . however ,",
    "if the stellar - mass black hole in the binary system is occulted by its companion star , the eclipsing light curves give the direct information for the spatial distribution of the brightness patterns of the accretion flows around the black hole .",
    "this is the primary motivation of the present study . in terms of the studies about the strong - gravity region around the stellar - mass black hole",
    ", some observations in the field of x - ray spectroscopy proposed the values of the spin parameters of stellar - mass black holes ( e.g. zhang et al . 1997 , miller et al .",
    "in addition , recently the works in this field have achieved the significant advances for understanding the accretion flows in the strong - gravity regions around the black holes ( e.g. davis et al .",
    "2006 , done & gierlinski 2003 , 2006 , gierlinski & done 2004 ) .    in the present study",
    ", we study the method to investigate the physical information included in the strong - gravity region around the black hole by light - curve analysis for an accretion disc around a black hole occulted by its companion star . the basic idea for the eclipsing light curve analysis",
    "was first proposed by fukue ( 1987 ) .",
    "watarai , takahashi & fukue ( 2005 ) investigated the eclipsing light curves for the supercritical accretion flows which may be suggested as the accretion flow model for some x - ray black - hole binaries . in principle , light curves obtained at the time of eclipsing have information about the black hole if the region around the black hole is optically thin .",
    "however , the real observational data of the eclipsing light curves may contain the additional effects which are not sometimes simple .",
    "one of such effects is the atmospheric effects of the companion star .",
    "recently , pietsch et al .",

    "the eclipsing light curves also contain the information of the atmosphere of the companion star .",
    "thus , the eclipsing light curve analysis will be used for the investigation of the atmosphere of the companion star . in the present study",
    ", we also investigate the companion star s atmospheric effects in the eclipsing light curves of the black - hole binaries , and compare these effects with the effects of the black hole s rotation . in  2 , we give the calculation method of the eclipsing light curves .",

    "the assumed atmospheric model of the companion star and the calculation method of the eclipsing light curves with the atmospheric effects of the companion star are given in  2.2 . in ",

    "the analysis by using the normalized light curves and the statistical quantities of the skewness and the kurtosis are performed in  3.2 and  3.3 , respectively . in  4 , we calculate eclipsing light curves with the atmospheric effects of the companion star .",
    "after we show the sample images of the black hole shadows with the atmospheric effects in  4.1 and the normalized light curves in  4.2 , the eclipsing light curves are analysed with respect to the observed photon energy in  4.3 , the black hole spin in  4.4 , and the inclination angle between the rotation axis of the disc and the direction of the observer in  4.5 .",

    "we also investigate how the eclipsing light curves depend on the observed photon energy in x - ray and the inclination angle .",
    "we first calculate the images of the black hole shadows with absorption effects in the atmosphere of the companion star . in figure",
    "[ fig : bhabs ] , we show images of black hole shadows when ingress at the observed frequency of 1 kev for cases with no absorption effects ( _ top panels _ ) and atmospheric photoionization absorptions ( _ bottom panels _ ) . we assume the mass of the companion star to be 1 @xmath140 .",
    "the size of each image is same as figure [ fig : bhimage ] , i.e. -20 [ @xmath35]@xmath14120 [ @xmath35 ] and -20 [ @xmath35]@xmath14220 [ @xmath35 ] . for no absorption case for top panels ,",
    "the edges of the companion star are located at -20 , -10 , 0 and 10 in units of @xmath35 ( _ left to right _ ) . for the cases with the atmospheric effects ( _ bottom panels _ ) , we define these edges as positions with @xmath143 .",
    "we can see that the brightness around the black hole shadow are decreased by the photoionization absorption in the atmosphere .",
    "in addition to the decrease of the absolute values of the brightness , the clear edges of the companion star which can be seen for no absorption cases are smeared out by the absorption effects .",
    "this is because the effective region with absorption effects is comparable to the size of x - ray emitting regions .",
    "we next calculate the eclipsing light curves with effects of the photoionization absorption . in figure",
    "[ fig : norlcabs_1kev ] , we show normalized light curves with ( _ thick lines _ ) and without ( _ thin lines _ ) the atmospheric effects of the companion star . the observed energy",
    "is set to be 1 kev in figure [ fig : norlcabs_1kev ] .",
    "the black hole spins are @xmath2 ( _ solid lines _ ) and 1 ( _ dotted lines _ ) , and the observed inclination angles with respect to the rotation axis of the accretion disc are @xmath4 ( _ top panels _ ) and @xmath5 ( _ bottom panels _ ) .",
    "while the normalization light curves with no absorption effects largely change in a short time when the most luminous parts of the accretion disc are occulted or unocculted by the sharp edge of the companion star , the normalization light curves with absorption effects gradually decrease or increase compared to the cases with no absorption effects .",
    "this is because the atmosphere of the companion star absorb some fraction of x - ray photons gradually before the most luminous part of the accretion disc is completely occulted or unocculted . in other words ,",
    "the width of the absorption region which causes the gradual changes of the x - ray brightness of the accretion disc is comparable to size of the luminous parts of the accretion disc as denoted above .",
    "the differences between the normalized light curves with absorption effects for @xmath2 and 1 become smaller than the cases of no absorption effects . when egress , i.e. @xmath144 , the normalized light curves with @xmath2 rise more rapidly than the cases of @xmath98 .",
    "that is to say , the timescale of the increase of normalized @xmath145 for @xmath2 is longer than that for @xmath135 .",
    "this is because the most luminous parts of the accretion disc for @xmath98 is more compact than those for @xmath135 .",
    "this results in the shorter crossing time of the companion star along the luminous parts of the disc for @xmath98 than the cases for @xmath2 .",
    "this feature can be seen in the case of no absorption by the companion star .",
    "since the size of the most luminous parts of the accretion disc depends on the black hole spin , the crossing timescale of the companion star along the most luminous parts of the accretion disc can be one of the key physical quantities which distinguish the cases of rapidly rotating black holes and the cases of no rotating black hole .",
    "but these effects are generally smeared out by the atmospheric effects of the companion star at some fraction . in our calculations assuming the solar atmosphere , the atmospheric absorption can not completely smeared out the difference between the cases of rapidly rotating black holes and the cases of no rotating black hole",
    "then , the observed eclipsing light curves at 1 kev with the atmospheric effects of the companion star possibly contain the information of the black hole spin .",
    "however , since the effects of the atmosphere is larger than the effects of the spin , only when we have the reliable atmospheric model , we can determine the black hole spin from the eclipsing light curves observed by the wavelength where the atmospheric absorption is effective .",

    "thus , the eclipsing light curves for higher photon energy can contain the information of the black hole shadows in case that the atmospheric smearing effects are negligible .         and the inclination angles of the observers are @xmath4 ( _ top panel _ ) and @xmath5 ( _ bottom panel _ ) . ,",

    "recently , pietsch et al . ( 2006 ) give the clear observational data of the eclipsing light curves for the x - ray binary m33 x-7 detected by _",
    "chandra_. while the absorption effects in the companion atmosphere seem to vanish the relativistic effects in the eclipsing light curves in their observational data , our calculations show that the information of the black hole spin in the eclipsing light curves can not be completely smeared out for the observed photon energy of 1 kev and 10 kev if we assume the solar - type atmospheric model .",
    "however , as denoted above , even if we have the reliable observational data with high signal - to - noise ratio , only when we have the reliable atmospheric model of the companion star , the physical information of the strong - gravity regime , such as , a black hole spin , can be obtained .",
    "in addition , in the present study we use the solar atmospheric model as a basic sample of the atmospheric structure . in the case of the eclipsing x - ray binary m33 x-7 ,",
    "the companion star is an o6iii star .",
    "although some recent observational data suggest the existence of corona in the atmosphere of herbig ae / be stars ( stelzer et al .",
    "2006 ) , it remains one of the unsolved issues whether the high temperature stars such as o - type stars have corona in their atmosphere . if there is the corona in the atmosphere of o - type stars , the stellar atmosphere will have two - temperature structure such as the solar atmosphere .",
    "in such cases , our calculations roughly calculate the light curves for the case of m33 x-7 .",
    "basically , the count rates of the x - ray photons from x - ray binaries in external galaxies with the possible exception of the magellanic clouds are generally much too low to provide the precise eclipse mapping of the inner portions of the accretion discs even in chandra observations . in addition , the time resolutions for the data of the eclipsing light curves for m33 x-7 are insufficient to precisely map the small strong - gravity regime in the center of the accretion flows . even in the case",
    "that the calculations in the present study are not used to the present low count rate observations in x - ray , future x - ray data with higher count rates obtained by the future x - ray telescope such as constellation - x observatory in nasa ( see , http://constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) or xeus ( x - ray evolving universe spectrometer ) in esa ( see , http://www.esa.int/science/xeus ) will provide the information of the extremely strong - gravity regions of the accretion discs .      while our calculation assumes the standard accretion disc , for the accretion discs with larger mass accretion rate , watarai , takahashi & fukue ( 2005 ) pointed out the light curves are deformed by the self - occultation effects , and shows that for larger mass accretion rate the skewness becomes small value and the kurtosis is nearly constant . on the other hand ,",
    "our analysis shows the larger the black hole spin becomes , the smaller the skewness becomes and the larger the kurtosis becomes for any observed inclination angles .",
    "the dependence of the kurtosis on the black hole spins contrast with the dependence of the mass accretion rate .",
    "we expect that the effects due to the black hole rotation can not be seen for discs with large mass accretion rate because of the self - occultation effect .",
    "the same analysis for the accretion discs with high mass accretion rate around rotating black hole is a topic for future study .",
    "moreover , from the eclipsing light curves , it may be possible to examine the disk structure such as stress at the marginally stable orbit , the angular dependence of the emitted radiation , and the dynamical structure relating the magnetic processes such as magnetorotational instabilities in the supersonic region which are the fundamental unsolved issues about the accretion flow models .",
    "these issues are also topics for future studies .",
    "so far , we implicitly neglect the effects of the heating of the atmosphere due to the absorbed x - ray photons in the atmosphere of the companion star . according to the calculations of the structure of the heated atmosphere ( e.g. basko & sunyaev 1973 ) , the temperature of the atmosphere increase by about factor 2 due to the absorbed x - ray photons .",
    "the number density is also changed by similar factor .",
    "although these changes causes the quantitative changes of the optical depth in x - ray of the atmosphere of the companion star , we do not expect the qualitative changes of the dependence of the eclipsing light curves on the physical parameters .",
    "since the absorption effects basically do not change the timescale of the change of the eclipsing light curves , the effects of the x - ray heating will not drastically alter the dependence of the crossing timescale of the luminous parts of the accretion disc .",
    "in addition to the changes of the optical depths , a x - ray heating effects causes a radiatively driven stellar wind originated from the x - ray heated atmosphere ( e.g. blondin 1994 , wojdowski et al .",
    "the atmospheric profile of the companion star is not the same between ingress and egress due to this effect .",
    "since this effects also change the optical depth of the atmosphere in x - ray , we expect the effect will not change the timescale of the change of the eclipsing light curves drastically .",
    "asymmetric brightness distribution exists not only in black hole x - ray binaries , but also in neutron star x - ray binaries ( nsxbs ) .",
    "this is because the relativistic effects still works in nsxbs . even in the case",
    "that the emission from the neutron star is dominant , the asymmetric component still remains in its light curves as long as the emission from the neutron star surface is isotropic .",
    "the observational data for the eclipsing neutron star binaries are actually obtained ( e.g. homan et al . 2003 ) . in the case of",
    "optically thin along the light paths , we can estimate the emitting radius from the duration time of ingress or egress , and measure the spin of the neutron star from the skewness analysis of the asymmetric eclipsing light curves . according to our results ,",
    "the result does not depend on the inclination angle .",
    "weaver & yaqoob ( 1998 ) shows the `` deep minimum '' in the x - ray light curves of seyfert 1 galaxy mgc-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "some obscuring body in the line of sight seem to cause the occultation phenomena in the light curves .",
    "only when such events occur many times and the typical features of the light curves are obtained , and the photons from the vicinity of the black hole are directly detected , it may be possible to obtain the physical information in the vicinity of the black hole , such as the size of emission region and black hole spin .",
    "in this paper , we propose an eclipsing light - curve diagnosis for accretion flows around rotating black holes .",
    "when emission from an inner part of the accretion disc around black hole is occulted by a companion star , the light curves at ingress and egress show the asymmetric features due to the relativistic effects such as doppler boosting originally pointed out by fukue ( 1987 ) .",
    "our calculations include the asymmetric feature due to the black hole rotation .",
    "after we give the calculation method of the eclipsing light curves with and without the atmospheric effects of the companion star in  2.1 and  2.2 , respectively , the numerical calculation of the eclipsing light curves are performed and the analysis for the curves are given .",
    "when no atmospheric effects of the companion star , the effects of the black hole rotations on the light curves are clearly seen in the light curves (  3.1 ) , the normalized light curves (  3.2 ) and the statistical quantities of skewness and kurtosis (  3.3 ) . we show that the eclipsing light curves without the atmospheric effects clearly reflect the effects of the black hole s rotation .",
    "we also investigate the eclipsing light curves with the atmospheric effects of the companion star .",
    "based on the adopted atmospheric model , after evaluating the absorption and scattering effects in x - ray , we calculate the images of the black hole shadows in  4.1 , the normalized light curves  4.2 .",
    "the analysis of the eclipsing light curves with the atmospheric effects are given in terms of the observed photon energy (  4.3 ) , the black hole spin (  4.4 ) and the inclination angle (  4.5 ) .",
    "the higher the observed photon energy become , the shorter the timescales of the changes of the normalization light curves become .",
    "this is because the crossing time of the companion star is shortest in the case of 10 kev and longest in the case of 0.1 kev .",
    "since the size of the most luminous parts of the accretion disc depends on the black hole spin , the crossing timescale of the companion star along the most luminous parts of the accretion disc can be one of the key physical quantities which distinguish the cases of rapidly rotating black holes and the cases of no rotating black hole . in our calculations assuming the solar atmosphere , while the effects of black hole spins are negligible when the observed photon energy of 0.1 kev for both cases with no atmospheric effects and with atmospheric effects , for the observed photon energies of 1 kev and 10 kev the atmospheric absorption can not completely smeared out the difference between the cases of rapidly rotating black holes and the cases of no rotating black hole . however , these effects are smeared out by the atmospheric effects of the companion star at some fraction , and in our atmospheric model , the effects of the atmosphere are much larger than the effects of the black - hole spin . therefore , even in the case that the light - curves contain the information of the black hole spin , it may be difficult to extract the information of the black hole spin if we do not have the realistic atmospheric profiles , such as , the temperature , the number densities for several elements . even in such cases , based on our calculations ,",
    "the light curve asymmetries due to the rotation of the accretion disc exist .",
    "only when we have the reliable atmospheric model , in principle , the black hole spin can be determined from the eclipsing light curves observed around 1 kev .",
