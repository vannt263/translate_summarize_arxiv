    "given the negligible stress in the @xmath65 and @xmath64 directions , the strain in these directions in the c - si substrate is related to that in the @xmath23-direction by the poisson ratios : @xmath66 due to the small a - si : h film thickness compared to the wafer thickness , and continuity of the strain parallel to the interface ( assuming no slip ) , @xmath25 and @xmath67 at the top of the c - si substrate are equal to those in the a - si : h thin film .",

    "backscattering from the ( 001 ) surface is only sensitive to the @xmath74 mode , and there is no mixing between the @xmath74 mode and the other two in the absence of shear involving the @xmath64 direction , so we do not observe strain - induced splitting of the c - si peak @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue of the secular equation for the @xmath74 mode is @xmath75 \\epsilon_{xx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the peak shift from @xmath76 , the frequency at neutral strain , is given by @xmath77    for the strain coefficients , there are several values available in the literature from uniaxial stress experiments , based on different excitation wavelengths .",
    "the experiment at 632.8 nm @xcite obtained @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and was sensitive only to the near - surface region .",
    "an experiment at 1064 nm from some of the same authors obtained @xcite instead @xmath78 and @xmath79 , more precise and somewhat higher .",
    "the penetration depth is about 100 @xmath3 m at 1064 nm rather than 1 @xmath3 m at 632 nm @xcite , so the signal came from the bulk ; they argue that at the surface , there was stress relaxation , giving lower values . in this work ,",
    "since we are using 632.8 nm and only measuring the near - surface region , we calibrate using the experiment with those conditions @xcite , since the same out - of - plane surface stress relaxation in c - si ( _ i.e. _ greater local poisson ratio @xmath80 ) should be occurring in our unaxially stressed wafer . since a - si : h is prepared in thin - film form and not as a bulk material , this @xmath81 m near - surface region is the only region of interest .",
    "in this section we analyze the practicability of strain mapping of a - si : h films by raman microscopy using the coefficient determined in this work , showing that the situation is not very different from c - si for which there are many successful applications of the technique @xcite .    to find an absolute level of strain , one needs a reference unstrained peak position . in the case of c - si ,",
    "reported values in the literature are @xmath82 @xcite and @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in this reference position are much larger for a - si : h  the to peak is in the range @xmath84 , varying systematically and reproducibly due to deposition conditions such as temperature , substrate , and hydrogen content @xcite .",
    "nave use of such literature values as a reference would lead to a corresponding large uncertainty in the inferred absolute strain .",
    "typically absolute levels of strain are not the quantity of interest in a raman microscopy study , however .",
    "the point is to show spatial variation in strain , and changes due to heating , etching , deposition , crystallization , etc . , for which an absolute reference is not required .",
    "for example , c - si strain mapping is commonly used in situations where the peak shifts of interest are only 0.1 @xmath8 , much less than the uncertainties in the reference position , because only relative amounts of strain are being studied @xcite .",
    "if an absolute strain measurement is really needed , the uncertainty in the reference peak position can be greatly reduced by performing a control experiment in which a film is deposited under the same conditions , any strain is relieved by etching away the substrate , and the raman peak position is measured for the unstrained film @xcite to find the reference .",
    "another approach is to measure the average strain in the film via substrate curvature and stoney s equation ( the typical strain measurement on thin films @xcite ) , or via x - ray diffraction @xcite , and then use raman microscopy to measure the local deviations from the average .",
    "peak shifts can be mapped to strain with a single coefficient over a certain linear regime .",
    "our experimental measurements had a strain range of 0.33% ( equivalent to 1.7 @xmath8 or 260 mpa ) , and our set of theoretical calculations used @xmath19% ( @xmath122.3 @xmath8 or @xmath12400 mpa ) , showing linearity over this range .",
    "these ranges were chosen as the maximum before fracture of the c - si substrate in our 4-point bending setup , and a value close to levels of experimental interest that gave sufficiently resolvable peak shifts in the calculations .",
    "in fact , our further theoretical calculations showed the linear regime extends to at least @xmath85% strain ( @xmath124.6 @xmath8 or @xmath12800 mpa ) .",
    "therefore strain mapping can be applied straightforwardly throughout this range . at some yet higher strain level",
    ", the higher - order anharmonicity of the interatomic potential and the atomic rearrangements under strain may cause a nonlinear strain - frequency relation , and the raman intensities themselves may be altered .",
    "strain mapping could be still be possible in this regime with a higher - order polynomial model .",
    "the sensitivity of strain mapping is limited by the uncertainty in the determination of the raman peak position , setting the smallest strain differences that can be resolved .",
    "we had an error of 0.3 @xmath8 for deconvolution of the broad gaussian peak of a - si : h .",
    "this should be compared to 0.05 @xmath8 , the best resolution obtainable for c - si peak shifts according to de wolf @xcite .",
    "that resolution is limited not only by uncertainty in peak fitting ( we had a much smaller error of 0.005 @xmath8 for the sharp lorentzian of c - si ) , but also the stability over time of the raman spectrometer , which should apply equally to measuring a - si : h in its nearby frequency range .",
    "thus a - si : h uncertainty is only 6 times less than the quoted best obtainable for c - si as of 1996 , a level that has proved to be sufficient for a wide range of successful applications of raman strain mapping .",
    "in fact , raman peak shifts in a - si : h over ranges much larger than this level are commonly reported : 9 @xmath8 from thermal stress @xcite , 2.5 @xmath8 from cantilever bending @xcite , 8 @xmath8 from laser heating for crystallization ( the original motivation for this work ) @xcite .",
    "these shifts imply stress up to 1.5 gpa . a sensitivity of 0.3 @xmath8 ( about @xmath86 strain or 50 mpa ) is more than sufficient to infer strain differences from the raman spectra measured in these works .",
    "moreover , while our uncertainty was sufficiently small that it did not dominate the ultimate uncertainty of the measured raman strain coefficient , it is not necessarily the best that can be achieved if one sets out to resolve small strains .",
    "there may be scope for improvement with better raman spectrometer resolution and better signal - to - noise ratio from longer integration times or increased intensity ( limited by the need to avoid heating the a - si : h to the point of crystallization ) .    in c",
    "- si , the actual strain tensor is generally accessible only through elasticity modeling @xcite ( or to some degree from raman measurements with high numerical aperture and polarizers @xcite ) .",
    "a given peak shift , due to the splitting of the three degenerate optical phonons , could be caused by various different strain magnitudes and patterns , as determined by solving a quadratic equation for the eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "one can only determine what the strain magnitude is by assuming strain patterns such as uniaxial , biaxial , or triaxial with respect to particular axes , without any simple way of summarizing this information @xcite .",
    "we have the same issue for a - si : h that the strain pattern is left undetermined by the peak shift measurement .",
    "however , since there is no degeneracy and the shift is just proportional to the trace as @xmath52 , we can determine the trace ( a mathematical invariant ) of the stress tensor , and express the conclusion in closed form .",
    "thus a - si : h strain mapping has the advantage of a simpler analysis .",
    "raman microscopy has many advantages as a strain measurement method , even beyond the unique ability to obtain spatial resolution .",
    "it is non - destructive , unlike methods involving etching away a substrate @xcite ; it uses a technique already widely employed on a - si : h for other purposes @xcite ; it can be used to study the material at varying depths @xcite depending on the chosen excitation energy @xcite , including when buried under another sufficiently transparent material ; it can simultaneously measure the strain in different materials in the device , such as c - si in the substrate as we have done here ; it can be used to extract local temperatures too via the stokes / anti - stokes intensity ratio @xcite , and it can be used to monitor strain in real time @xcite ."

    "<S> note that if uniaxial strain rather than stress had been assumed in the wafer , we would have obtained @xmath40 and @xmath41 , yielding almost the same value @xmath42 , showing insensitivity to the exact mechanical boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we quote our result with respect to strain , rather than stress , to be more general since the shifts are due directly to bond length changes , and the young s modulus relating stress and strain can vary by a factor of 2 depending on synthesis conditions @xcite .     </S>",

    "<S> c - si has a complicated dependence on the strain pattern due to its symmetry , but a - si : h is isotropic except at very short length scales . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in our 70-atom cells , the calculated dielectric constant is @xmath44 with anisotropy only @xmath45 . due to this effective symmetry , the calculated vibrational modes in the to peak are delocalized , roughly isotropic , and sensitive to raman scattering in any polarization ( see inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : expt_neutral_raman ] ) . nonetheless , without any true symmetry , there is no counterpart to the three - fold degeneracy of the c - si optical phonons . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the to band transforms as a scalar rather than a vector as for c - si . </S>",
    "<S> since there is no degeneracy there is no splitting as of the c - si modes @xcite . in general , the frequency shift for such a scalar mode in a material would be @xmath46 where @xmath47 , like @xmath0 , is a symmetric rank-2 tensor . for an isotropic material , </S>",
    "<S> symmetry dictates @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the peak shift is determined only by the trace of the strain tensor : @xmath49 indeed , we find in our calculations that the raman spectrum is almost indistinguishable for applied uniaxial , biaxial , or triaxial strain tensors with the same trace , even on a single 70-atom cell ( see si @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis applies generally to isotropic amorphous vibrational modes .    </S>",

    "<S> the agreement also implies lack of slip between the a - si : h film and c - si substrate , as has been argued for thermal expansion of epitaxial graphene @xcite , as slip would relax strain and lower the measured coefficient . </S>",
