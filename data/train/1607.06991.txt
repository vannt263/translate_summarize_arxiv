    "plasmonic lasers that utilize metal - clad cavities confine electromagnetic energy in the form of surface - plasmon - polaritons ( spps ) at subwavelength dimensions .",
    "they have seen rapid development for targeted applications in nanoscale optics and integrated optical sensing .",
    "the most common types of plasmonic lasers utilize fabry - prot  type cavities in which one dimension is not subwavelength and is typically much longer than the other two dimensions  @xcite . for applications requiring spectral purity ( single - mode operation ) at the desired wavelength ,",
    "tunability is a desired characteristic that is challenging to implement for such lasers .",
    "this stems from the difficulty in external control of the resonant - cavity mode such as that in conventional external - cavity tuning techniques for semiconductor lasers , since the subwavelength characteristics of such lasers lead to poor coupling between the cavity - modes with free - space propagating modes .",
    "prior work on development of tunable plasmonic lasers has primarily focused on changing the gain medium of the cavity itself  @xcite .",
    "terahertz quantum - cascade lasers ( qcls )  @xcite with metallic cavities  @xcite are one such subset of plasmonic lasers , which also suffer for such challenges with respect to their tunability .",
    "terahertz qcls are the brightest available solid - state sources  @xcite of coherent terahertz radiation .",
    "they have witnessed significant development in the past decade in multiple areas such as wave engineering with distributed - feedback ( dfb ) techniques  @xcite , output - power  @xcite , temperature performance and frequency - coverage  @xcite , and frequency tunability  @xcite .",
    "single - mode terahertz qcls are particularly required for a multitude of applications in sensing and spectroscopy . however , due to limits on accuracy of lithography utilized to implement dfb , it is still challenging to achieve single - mode emission from dfb qcls at the exact desired frequency for applications such as high - resolution heterodyne spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "frequency tuning post - fabrication is desired to overcome this problem . up to now , a variety of tuning techniques for terahertz qcls have been demonstrated .",
    "temperature tuning is simple but lacks large tunability  @xcite .",
    "techniques such as applying external - cavities  @xcite or modal perturbation using electromechanical methods  @xcite have the ability to achieve large tuning range but at the cost of discontinuous tuning , or system complexity and poor radiation patterns and temperature performance for such qcls respectively .    a static - tuning technique based on post - process dielectric deposition was recently demonstrated for terahertz qcls with third - order dfb operating at @xmath5 with a tuning of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "( the tuning could be extended while the qcl is in operation , but only temporarily , by deposition of solid nitrogen through multiple - cycle condensation to @xmath7 in a liquid - helium cryostat ) .",
    "along similar lines , we here demonstrate a greatly enhanced continuous tuning range of @xmath0 for single - mode qcls emitting at @xmath8 and operating at @xmath2 , achieved by deposition of silicon - dioxide post - fabrication , and with significantly improved beam profiles .",
    "prior work on large ( @xmath9 ) tuning in refs .",
    "[ ] is achieved by perturbing the lateral evanescent mode of metallic cavities , which requires the cavities to be made very narrow ( deep - subwavelength , @xmath10 wide cavities with the standard @xmath11 thickness ) , and thereby makes the fabrication very challenging ( with the requirement of sophisticated dry - etching techniques ) as well as degrades the temperature and power performance of the qcls considerably .",
    "in contrast , the tuning in this report places no such restrictions on the dimensions of the qcl cavity and is demonstrated for wide cavities processed with routine wet - etching methods .",
    "the large tuning is facilitated by a recently developed `` antenna - feedback '' scheme for plasmonic lasers , which was experimentally implemented for terahertz qcls with metallic cavities  @xcite .",
    "this mode - hop free tuning performance can be controlled by the thickness of deposited silicon - dioxide , is reversible , and can be implemented on already mounted and soldered qcl chips , which makes it attractive for future commercialization of single - mode terahertz qcls . importantly ,",
    "in contrast to all previous tuning results for terahertz qcls that have been demonstrated at temperatures close - to that of liquid - helium , this work achieves large tuning for qcls operating in a liquid - nitrogen cooled dewar since the tuning mechanism does not impact the gain of the qcl sensitively .",
    "neither does the tuning method mandate a large dynamic range in current for the qcl in operation , which is in contrast with the methods relying on frequency - pulling due to stark - shifted gain spectrum with changing electrical bias of the qcl that requires operation at low - temperatures  @xcite .",
    "plasmonic lasers , of which the terahertz qcls with metallic cavities are a specific example , lead to highly divergent far - field radiation patterns owing to the subwavelength dimensions of their radiating apertures .",
    "the antenna - feedback scheme for plasmonic lasers  @xcite couples the resonant surface - plasmon - polariton ( spp ) mode in the cavity to a highly directional far - field radiation pattern .",
    "this occurs by exciting hybrid spps with a large spatial extent in the surrounding medium of the cavity by the mechanism of bragg diffraction , which is affected by implementation of a grating in the metal - cladding of the plasmonic laser as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . with the choice of a specific periodicity in the grating ,",
    "the resonant spp wave inside the cavity is coupled via distributed - feedback ( dfb ) to a hybrid spp wave that can propagate in the surrounding medium on the opposite side of the metal - film being used in the cavity of the plasmonic laser .    for terahertz qcls with metallic cavities",
    "the antenna - feedback scheme could be implemented by introducing slit - like - apertures in its top metallic cladding as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . for a chosen grating periodicity @xmath12 , a dfb mode with free - space wavelength @xmath13 ( and frequency @xmath14 ) given by the equation",
    "@xmath15 is resonantly excited for the case when the coupling between the spp wave in the cavity and the spp wave in the surrounding medium is via first - order bragg diffraction  @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath16 is the effective propagation index of the spp wave inside the cavity ( which is approximately same as the refractive - index of the cavity s active medium ) and @xmath17 is the effective propagation index of the hybrid spp wave in the surrounding medium ( which is approximately same as the refractive - index of the surrounding medium ) .",
    "equation   is distinctly different from that of any other solid - state dfb laser that has been reported in literature , in that the refractive index of the surrounding medium is equally important in setting the resonant - frequency of the dfb mode of the laser as is the refractive index of the active medium inside the cavity .",
    "in other conventional solid - state lasers , the effect of the surrounding medium on the resonant - frequency is primarily a function of the fraction of evanescent mode of the cavity that propagates in its surroundings ( typically represented by a mode - confinement factor , @xmath18 ) , which is also the case for the tunable terahertz qcl reported in ref .  .",
    "however , in the antenna - feedback scheme , the contribution of the surrounding medium is due to considerations of phase - matching  @xcite rather than the fraction of the overall electromagnetic energy propagating outside the cavity .",
    "consequently , the resonant - frequency of the dfb mode depends sensitively on the refractive - index of the surrounding medium that could be altered to tune the frequency of the plasmonic laser , which is the technique employed for terahertz qcls presented here .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is a unique mechanism to tune the frequency of a solid - state laser for which there is no analogous precedent in literature .",
    "a @xmath11 thick terahertz qcl structure was grown by molecular beam epitaxy with a three - well resonant - phonon gaas/@xmath19  design scheme  @xcite .",
    "the metallic qcl cavities with antenna - feedback gratings were fabricated using standard wafer - wafer thermocompression bonding and contact lithography technique . a scanning electron microscope image of the finally fabricated qcl devices is shown in fig .  [ fig1](b ) .",
    "[ fig1](c ) shows a 2d finite - element ( fem ) simulation of the dominant tm - polarized ( @xmath20 ) electric - field for a typical cavity ( of infinite - width , for 2d simulation ) with antenna - feedback gratings in the top - metal cladding .",
    "as can be seen , the the resonant dfb mode excites a single - sided spp wave in the surrounding medium , which is established as a standing - wave on the top - metal cladding with a large spatial extent in the vertical dimension ( @xmath21 direction ) .",
    "hence , any changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium serve to change the effective propagation constant @xmath17 of the single - sided spp mode , which tunes the excitation frequency of the resonant - dfb mode according to equation  .",
    "the active - medium of the qcls is based on a three - well resonant - phonon design with gaas/@xmath19  superlattice ( design rtrp3w197 , wafer number vb0464 ) , which is described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and was grown by molecular - beam epitaxy .",
    "the qcl superlattice is @xmath11 thick with an average @xmath22-doping of @xmath23 , and surrounded by @xmath24 and @xmath25 thick highly - doped gaas contact layers at @xmath26 on either side of the superlattice .",
    "fabrication of qcls with parallel - plate metallic cavities followed a cu - cu thermocompression wafer bonding technique as in ref .",
    "@xcite with standard optical contact lithography .",
    "lateral and longitudinal absorbing boundaries were implemented by exposing the highly doped gaas layer in the finally fabricated cavities , and the fabrication procedure is the same as in ref .  .",
    "ti / au metal layers of thickness @xmath27 nm were used as the top metal cladding , using an image - reversal lithography mask for implementing gratings in the metal layers .",
    "another positive - resist lithography step was used to cover the grating - metal with photoresist to be used as a mask for wet - etching of ridges in a h@xmath28so@xmath29:h@xmath28o@xmath28:h@xmath28o @xmath30:@xmath31:@xmath32 solution .",
    "a ti / au contact was used as the backside - metal contact for the finally fabricated qcl chips to assist in soldering . before deposition of backside - metal of the wafer",
    ", the substrate was mechanically polished down to a thickness of @xmath33 to improve heat - sinking .    by deposition of silicon - dioxide post - fabrication ( after the qcl chip is already mounted and wire - bonded on a copper mount ) , the lasing frequency of the resonant antenna - feedback mode is tuned sensitively .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the variation of a specific qcl s wavelength of emission when increasing the thickness of blanket deposited silicon - dioxide on the entire qcl chip .",
    "as expected from equation  , the lasing wavelength undergoes a red - shift with increasing thickness of the oxide , since then , the effective propagation index @xmath17 for the spp wave in the surrounding medium of the qcl will increase .",
    "the measured qcl has a grating period @xmath34 and the cavity s dimensions are @xmath35 .",
    "a cleaved chip consisting of qcls with antenna - feedback gratings was in - soldered on a cu block , the qcl to be tested was wire - bonded for electrical biasing , and the cu block was mounted on the cold - stage of a liquid nitrogen vacuum cryostat for measurements . in this experiment ,",
    "the frequency of the qcl was first measured without any dielectric deposition , and it radiated in a single - mode at @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "afterwards , the resonant - frequency is changed by depositing silicon - dioxide on top of the mounted qcl chip using a plasma - enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( pecvd ) system .",
    "the deposited thickness is carefully calibrated by simultaneously including a bare gaas wafer in the pecvd chamber for each deposition step .",
    "qcl s spectra were measured at @xmath2 in linear - scan mode with a resolution of @xmath38 using a ftir with room - temperature pyroelectric detector .",
    "multiple cycles of spectral measurement and oxide - deposition were implemented and the tuning results are collected and shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig2 ] , which illustrates a large red - shift tuning with this mechanism .",
    "finally , a mode - hop - free and continuous tuning of @xmath39 ghz was achieved after an overall deposited thickness of @xmath40 .",
    "further tuning could not be realized since qcl stopped lasing at @xmath2 beyond the stated thickness .",
    "the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] were all measured at similar bias currents . when etching away the deposited sio@xmath41 on top of the laser device by buffered - hf ( boe @xmath42 ) etchant , the qcl was characterized again and its emission properties including the lasing wavelength returned to its original value , which illustrates that tuning by post - process deposition of sio@xmath41 on terahertz qcls here is a reversible method .",
    "figure  [ fig3](a ) characterizes the variation of the qcl s emission frequency as a function of thickness of the deposited silicon - dioxide .",
    "the variation is non - linear , and the rate of tuning as a function of oxide - thickness decreases as more oxide is deposited .",
    "a 2d finite - element simulation was not able to reproduce this non - linear tuning since the hybrid spp mode in the surrounding medium of the cavity in the vertical direction ( above the cavity ) has a large spatial extent .",
    "correspondingly , the tuning computed with 2d simulations is predominantly linear for an overall oxide thickness of few microns .",
    "however , it is argued that the non - linear tuning behavior as observed here is due to the complex spatial nature of the spp mode in the surrounding medium in the lateral dimensions  @xcite , which could only be captured by 3d simulations that are outside the scope of this present work due to hardware limitations in performing such simulations .",
    "the dependency of measured maximum lasing temperature and peak output power at @xmath2 with oxide thickness is shown in figure  [ fig3](b ) . without any post - process deposition of the oxide , this terahertz qcl device lased up to @xmath43 with peak output - power of @xmath44 at @xmath2 .",
    "when deposition thickness reaches @xmath40 and @xmath39 ghz tuning is obtained , the maximum lasing temperature of this device is slightly above @xmath2 and the peak output - power reduces to @xmath45w at @xmath2 . the emitted optical power was measured with a deuterated triglycine sulfate pyroelectric detector ( dtgs ) pyroelectric detector ( gentec thz 2i - bl - bnc ) and calibrated with a terahertz thermopile power - meter ( scientech model ac2500h ) without any optical component or cone collecting optic inside the cryostat .",
    "the power values are reported without any corrections to the detected signal .",
    "two reasons contribute to the decrease in maximum lasing temperature and output - power of the qcl with increasing oxide thickness .",
    "first , thin - film oxide deposited by pecvd is a lossy material at terahertz frequencies for which the absorption coefficient could be as high as @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the confinement factor @xmath18 of the resonant - cavity mode , which is the fraction of the mode that resides in the active - medium , decreases as thicker oxide is deposited .",
    "this is primarily because the higher electric - permittivity of the oxide @xmath47 ( at terahertz frequencies ) . as a consequence",
    "the effective threshold gain is increased for exciting the resonant - cavity mode , which also reduces optical power due to an increase in the effective modal propagation loss in the cavity as well as reduction in the net dynamic range for lasing current .",
    "a precise analytical or numerical estimation of the net effect of oxide thickness on the threshold gain and qcl s temperature and power performance is beyond the scope of this work because , first , in case of terahertz qcls various transport parameters as well as waveguide loss parameters can not be predicted accurately , and second , the estimation of @xmath18 requires 3d finite - element simulation of the qcl s cavity with deposited oxide that can not be done due to aforementioned reasons .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows light - current ( @xmath48-@xmath49 ) characteristics in pulsed operation for the qcl operated at different heat - sink temperatures along with its lasing spectra at different bias when varying deposition thickness of the silicon - dioxide . at start",
    "when no oxide is deposited , the qcl operated up to a maximum temperature @xmath50 with peak output - power of @xmath44 at @xmath2 . with @xmath51 thick oxide ,",
    "the maximum operating temperature reduced to @xmath52 and the peak output - power was similarly lowered to @xmath53 at @xmath2 .",
    "the qcl predominantly radiates at a single frequency around @xmath54 that corresponds to the desired dfb mode of the cavity .",
    "however , at higher current - densities closer to peak operating bias ( @xmath55 ) , a second mode at shorter - wavelength is excited , which suggests that a higher - order lateral mode was likely excited due to spatial - hole burning in the cavity ( since such a mode has a smaller effective propagation index @xmath16 in the cavity ) .",
    "the excitation of the higher - order lateral mode ceases in the entire operating range of the qcl as thicker oxide is deposited .",
    "when the oxide thickness is increased to @xmath56 corresponding to @xmath57ghz frequency tuning , the qcl lased up to @xmath58 with peak output - power of @xmath59 at @xmath2 .",
    "single mode spectra with lasing frequency @xmath60 were measured under all bias conditions over the whole dynamic range , namely from threshold until negative differential - resistance ( ndr ) as shown in figure  [ fig4](c ) . when total thickness of the deposited oxide is @xmath61 ,",
    "only limited spectra were recorded at current - densities of @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively while the qcl is still operating at @xmath2 in a liquid - nitrogen cooled dewar .",
    "the qcl stopped lasing at @xmath2 when additional oxide was deposited .",

    "[ fig4 ] are @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 respectively , which increase with the thickness of the deposited oxide . from the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] it can be noted that more than @xmath68 of the available tuning (  @xmath69 tuning ) could be realized by depositing less than @xmath70 thick silicon - dioxide , in which case there is no significant degradation in maximum operating temperature or power output from the qcl .",
    "radiation in a directional ( narrow ) beam is one of the most important and attractive characteristics of terahertz plasmonic qcls with the antenna - feedback scheme  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows measured beam patterns of the qcl at @xmath2 for varying thicknesses of the deposited oxide .",
    "far - field radiation patterns were measured with a dtgs pyroelectric cell detector mounted on a computer - controlled two - axis moving stage in the end - fire ( @xmath71 ) direction at a distance of @xmath72 mm from the qcl s end - facets . without any oxide ,",
    "the qcl emits in a single - lobed beam with narrow divergence with full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath73 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .",
    "after @xmath74 nm thick oxide was deposited , the radiation pattern remained single - lobed but with a slightly increased fwhm of @xmath75 .",
    "a further deposition of oxide to a thickness of @xmath76 nm increased the fwhm of the main lobe to @xmath77 .",
    "the small increase in beam divergence for thicker oxide deposition is likely due to reduction in spatial extent of the spp mode on top of the cavity with oxide thickness . due to the limits in the sensitivity of the of the room - temperature dtgs detector , the radiation patterns",
    "could not be measured with a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio after deposition of even thicker oxide .",
    "however , since the qcl continues to radiate in the same cavity mode , it should retain its characteristic radiation into single - lobed narrow beams .",
    "plasmonic lasers utilize metallic cavities to confine the electromagnetic mode at subwavelength dimensions .",
    "however , poor radiative coupling to free - space makes it difficult to statically or dynamically tune their emission frequency , which is required for practical applications .",
    "the tuning mechanisms demonstrated so - far involve alteration of gain - medium itself .",
    "terahertz qcls with metallic cavities suffer from similar challenges that has prevented development of tunable qcls that could work at high - temperatures . in this work , we show that a recently developed antenna - feedback scheme for plasmonic lasers could offer an ideal solution for both static tuning ( as demonstrated here ) or dynamic tuning and frequency modulation ( in principle ) , while simultaneously achieving single - mode operation and narrow - beam emission from the sub - wavelength plasmonic cavities .",
    "the antenna - feedback scheme leads to the establishment of a hybrid spp standing - wave in the surrounding medium of the laser s cavity with a large spatial extent .",
    "the emission frequency of the plasmonic laser depends sensitively on the effective propagation index of the spp mode in the surrounding medium , which could be altered independently of the gain medium used inside the laser s cavity .",
