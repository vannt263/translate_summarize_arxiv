    "several physical qualities based on the spectral functions are usually given in the trarpes experiments , and will be calculated below in order to compare with the experimental results .",

    "[ bandgap](a ) ) , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fermi - dirac ( fd ) distribution function , which depends on the electronic temperature @xmath8 .",

    "in the two - temperature scenario , as @xmath8 decreases from @xmath14 to the equilibrium temperature @xmath10 , the sc gap increases and the thermal distribution of qps is suppressed , then the number of excited qps is reduced .",
    "this process is reflected in the time - evolution of the arpes intensity @xmath49.@xcite    a more relevant quantity is the change of the arpes intensity between the two temperatures @xmath8 and @xmath10 , @xmath53 it is convenient to introduce the line - momentum - integrated density of states(dos hereafter ) along the momentum cutline @xmath50 , @xmath54 , then @xmath16 is decomposed into two terms , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the change of the distribution function , and @xmath57 is the change of the dos along @xmath50 .",

    "[ bandgap](c ) and ( d ) , we show the results of @xmath16 for the system for two sets of fs angles , i.e. a diagonal cutline @xmath17 ( nodal cutline ) and an off - nodal cutline @xmath18 , respectively . the two temperatures are @xmath58k , and @xmath59k .",
    "@xmath60 is strongly dependent on the cutline . for the nodal cutline , @xmath60 is approximately antisymmetric with respect to @xmath61 , similar to the change of the fermi distribution function @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , @xmath63 at @xmath64 . for the non - nodal cutline ,",
    "the shape is far from the antisymmetric , and @xmath65 is finite and positive , and @xmath66 occurs at @xmath67 .",
    "our calculations are in good agreement with the experimental data,@xcite which are reproduced in fig .",

    "the strong fs angle dependence of the arpes intensity is associated with the symmetry of the sc gap function . for the nodal cutline of ( @xmath17 ) , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ diffint ] ) vanishes .",
    "furthermore , @xmath68 and @xmath62 is of substantial value only within a window of @xmath69 .",

    "( [ specfuc ] ) and @xmath72 , thus @xmath73 .",
    "another important quality given in trarpes experiments is the angle - resolved qp density . following the experiments,@xcite we define @xmath74 as the integral of the arpes intensity @xmath49 over @xmath61 above the fermi energy along the momentum cutline @xmath50 at temperature @xmath10 , and @xmath75 is the change of @xmath74 when the electronic temperature increased from @xmath10 to @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath76 below we analysis the dynamics of @xmath75 to further explain the trarpes experiments .",
    "it has been observed that the photoexcited qp density is strongly dependent on the fs angle @xmath25 similar to the d - wave sc gap function.@xcite according to our discussions above , the electronic temperature has been increased from @xmath10 to @xmath14 after the laser pumping , because the detailed electronic dynamics to reach such a quasi - equilibrium state has been washed out due to the large time resolution of the arpes measurements . then the sc gap is reduced and even closed if @xmath77 and more qps are also excited .",
    "thus we can calculate the photoexcited qp density according to eq .",

    "the nearly linear dependence of @xmath75 on the temperature @xmath8 shown in fig .",

    "[ fluscale](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "thus , unlike the angle - dependent decay rate of qps which is associated with the d - wave gap dynamics , the fluence - dependent decay rate of qps is due to the pairwise recombination of qps into cooper pairs .",
    "in conclusion , we show that the main features of the trarpes observations for d - wave superconductors so far can be explained within a simple two - temperature scenario . in this picture , the effective electronic temperature affects both the thermal distribution of the quasiparticles and the superconducting gap .",
    "the angle dependence of the photoexcited quasiparticle density and the quasiparticle decay rate are associated with the d - wave gap dynamics , while the fluence - dependent quasiparticle decay rate is attributed to the pairwise recombination of qps into cooper pairs .",
    "different from the original explanations of the experimental results,@xcite the two - temperature scenario here does nt refer to the details of the microscopic scattering processes , which have been washed out due to the thermalization of e - e scattering in the time scale @xmath7 .",
