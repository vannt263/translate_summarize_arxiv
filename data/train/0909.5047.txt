    "algol consists of a semi - detached eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 2.87 days ( b8v + k2iv ) with an f1iv spectral type star revolving around the binary every 680 days .",
    "the third component was succesfully observed by speckle interferometry , and its orbit was precisely determined by @xcite .",
    "this result was refined by using the mark iii optical stellar interferometer @xcite .    in the radio regime , @xcite detected positional displacement during the orbital revolution of the ab pair using the vlbi technique , and identified the k - subgiant as the source of radio emission . from their measurements",
    "@xcite calculated @xmath5 for the mutual inclination of the close and wide orbital planes .",
    "this value has been widely accepted since then . however",
    ", this mutual inclination value can not be correct due to dynamical considerations , because it would produce a fast variation in the observable inclination of the eclipsing subsystem , resulting in a fast eclipse depth variation which contradicts to the more than century - long photometric observations @xcite .",
    "the aim of this study was to constrain the mutual inclination of the system better , requiring the measurement of the longitude of the node for the close pair .",
    "the other orbital elements are well - known from spectroscopic or photometric data , but there is a controversy in the value of @xmath6 . because the expected apparent size of the close binary semi - major axis is of the order of 2 milliarcseconds ( mas ) , we carried out both optical and radio interferometry measurements .",
    "we carried out interferometric observations both in the optical / near - infrared , and in the radio regime .",
    "the optical interferometry observations were done by the chara array on three nights ( 2 , 3 and 4 december , 2006 ) in the @xmath7 band .",
    "the radio measurements were carried out with a subset of the european vlbi network ( evn ) on 14 - 15 december 2006 at 5  ghz . at this observation",
    "the e - vlbi technique was applied , where the telescopes stream the data to the central data processor ( jive , dwingeloo , the netherlands ) instead of recording .",
    "the participating telescopes were cambridge and jodrell bank ( uk ) , medicina ( italy ) , onsala ( sweden ) , toru ( poland ) and the westerbork phased array ( the netherlands ) . the measurements and the data reductions were carried out according to the standard procedures .",
    "( details can be read in @xcite . )    for the analysis of the chara visibilities we developed a model which was very close to the one of @xcite which is based on the roche - model , but it was implemented in idl to restore the surface intensities into a matrix and to calculate the sky - projected picture of the system . since we had only about two dozen visibility measurements , we wanted to limit the number of free parameters , choosing just three : the angular size of the semi - major axis @xmath8 , the surface brightness ratio in @xmath9 band @xmath10 , and the angle @xmath6 .",
    "all other parameters were fixed according to the values given in @xcite or in @xcite .",
    "after an extended grid search we got @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the vlbi data were gained during a secondary minimum , which , according to our simultaneous optical photometry , occurred at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the measurements lasted 9 hours , i.e. @xmath14 of the orbital period , but as the projected movement of the source is maximal around the minima , the covered projected orbital arc is significantly larger . due to the large inclination , this projected arc is almost a straight line parallel to the nodal line , which makes the determination of the longitude of the node more easier .",
    "unfortunately , during our measurements a radio flare occured which significantly reduced the accuracy of our position determination .",
    "our best fit gave @xmath15 , but we consider this result less reliable because it is difficult to assess how much the radio flare as well as atmospheric phase fluctuations might have affected our data ( e.g. the displacement of the source during our observation was almost twice of the calculated from keplerian revolution ) .    due to the above mentioned facts , here we concentrate mainly on the chara results .",
    "the true size of the obtained semi - major axis and surface brightness ratio are in very good agreement with previous results , which makes our nodal result also plausible .",
    "according to the chara results , the longitude of the node is @xmath0 with an ambiguity of @xmath16 . with the vlbi measurements we can resolve the @xmath17 ambiguity and conclude that @xmath18",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the value determined from polarimetric measurements ( @xmath19 , @xcite ) , indicating that polarimetry is an efficient tool to determine the spatial orientation of the orbits .    at this point",
    "we can determine the mutual inclination @xmath20 , and we get @xmath21 .",
    "this value is , however , closer to the exact perpendicularity than the @xmath3 which was based on the measurements of @xcite .",
    "in order to investigate the dynamical behaviour of algol in the near past and future , we carried out numerical integration of the orbits for the triple system .",
    "detailed description of our code can be found in @xcite .",
    "this code simultaneously integrates the equations of the orbital motions and the eulerian equations of stellar rotation .",
    "the code also includes stellar dissipation , but the short time interval of the data allows that term to be ignored .",
    "our input parameters for algol ab were taken from @xcite with the exception of @xmath6 which was set to @xmath22 in accordance with our chara result .",
    "the orbital elements of the wide orbit were almost identical to the elements given by @xcite . as further input parameters , the @xmath23",
    ", @xmath24 internal structure constants for the binary members were taken from the tables of @xcite .    here",
    "we consider only the observable inclination of the eclipsing pair .",
    "the computed variation of inclination between 7500 bc and 22500 ad was plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : algol_long ] . note that algol ab does not show eclipses when the inclination is lower than @xmath25 or higher than @xmath26 .",
    "it shows partial eclipses if the inclination is between @xmath25@xmath26 and moreover , it shows total eclipses when the inclination @xmath27@xmath28 .",
    "as one can see , algol started to show eclipses shortly after the beginning of the christian calendar .",
    "total eclipses occured during an almost 300-year - long interval at the end of the medieval , and at the dawn of the modern , scientific era . according to our integrations in the time of the discovery as a variable star @xcite , the inclination of the close pair was about @xmath29 which yielded a total eclipse ( with an amplitude of 2.8 mag , when the bright primary component is totally eclipsed , and the dominant light source is the distant c component ) , making discovery easier .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that this time - data are rough approximations only .",
    "since we could not determine the position of the node better than @xmath30 , and for exact calculations one needs an accuracy better by one order of magnitude , these numbers should be refined in the future .",
    "the chara array is funded by the national science foundation through nsf grants ast-0307562 and ast-06006958 and by georgia state university through the college of arts and sciences and the office of the vice president for research .",
