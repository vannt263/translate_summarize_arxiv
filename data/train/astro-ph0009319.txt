    "the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglow is believed to involve a relativistically expanding fireball",
    ". the surrounding matter , which we will refer to as the ism , influences the fireball shell after it has been collected enough and the considerable energy has been transferred from the shell to the ism .",
    "the energy transfer is due to two shocks : a forward shock propagating into the ism and a reverse shock propagating into the shell .",
    "the afterglow observations are fairly well described by the synchrotron emission from the ism electrons accelerated by the forward shock , it is considered as a confirmation of the relativistic fireball .",
    "however , the current afterglow observations detect the radiation from several hours after the grbs . at this stage , the lorentz factor of the forward shock is not ultra - relativistic , less than @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics depends only on two parameters : the explosion energy and the ism density .",
    "the afterglow observations provide neither verification of the extreme relativistic motion nor the properties of the fireball which can constrain models of the grb source .",
    "the counterpart of the afterglow , the emission from a reverse shock was also predicted ( mszaros & rees 1997 ; sari & piran 1999a ) . when a reverse shock crosses a shell , the forward shocked ism and the reverse shocked shell carry comparable amount of energy . however , the typical temperature of the shocked shell is lower since the mass density of the shell is higher .",
    "consequently , the typical frequency from the shocked shell is lower . a prompt optical emission from grb  990123 ( akerlof et al . 1999 )",
    "can be regarded as this emission ( sari & piran 1999b ; kobayashi & sari 2000 ) .",
    "the emission from the reverse shock is sensitive to the initial properties of the fireball .",
    "the observations can provide some important clues on the nature of the grb source .",
    "previous studies focused on the emission at the peak time . in this paper",
    "we calculate the full light curves for several frequency regimes .",
    "we in section 2 discuss the hydrodynamics of the relativistic fireballs on which the light curves highly depend . in section 3",
    "we calculate the light curves for a long burst and a short burst case .",
    "we compare our estimates with the rotse observations in section 4 .",
    "we estimate the initial parameters of the fireball of grb  990123 , and then we make some comments on the lack of the prompt detections by rotse for grb  981121 and grb  981223 . in section 5",
    "we give conclusions .",
    "consider a relativistic shell with an energy @xmath1 , a lorentz factor @xmath2 and a width in laboratory frame @xmath3 expanding into a surrounding medium ( ism ) with a particle number density @xmath4 .",
    "when the shell sweeps a large volume of the ism , it begins to be decelerated . the interaction between the shell and the ism",
    "is described by two shocks : a forward shock propagating into the ism and a reverse shock propagating into the shell .",
    "there are four region separated by the two shocks : the ism(denoted by the subscript 1 ) , the shocked ism(2 ) , the shocked shell material ( 3 ) and the unshocked shell material ( 4 ) . using the jump conditions for the shocks and the equality of pressure and velocity along the contact discontinuity , we can estimate the lorentz factor @xmath5 , the pressure @xmath6 and the number density @xmath7 in the shocked regions as functions of three variables @xmath8 and @xmath2 ( blandford and mckee 1976 ) .",
    "there are two limits to get a simple analytic solution ( sari and piran 1995 ) . if the shell density is high @xmath9 , the reverse shock is newtonian which means that the lorentz factor of the shocked shell material @xmath10 is almost unity in frame of the unshocked shell material .",
    "it is too weak to slow down the shell effectively @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the density is low @xmath12 , the reverse shock is relativistic @xmath13 and it considerably decelerates the shell material @xmath14 .",
    "once @xmath15 is determined , the density and the pressure in the shocked shell region are given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "in both cases , the time it takes for the reverse shock to cross a distance @xmath18 in the shell material can be given in a similar form up to a constant factor ( kobayashi , piran & sari 1999 ) , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the radius of the shell .",
    "since the motion of the shell is highly relativistic , we can regard @xmath21 as time in laboratory frame .",
    "when a shell is ejected from a source , it has a high density @xmath22 , so the reverse shock is initially newtonian .",
    "however , as the shell expands , the shell density decreases . there is a possibility that the shock becomes relativistic during it is crossing the shell .",
    "sari and piran ( 1995 ) showed that , using the sedov length @xmath23 , if the shell is thick : @xmath24 , the reverse shock becomes relativistic at @xmath25 before the crossing at @xmath26 . if the shell is thin : @xmath27 , it is dense enough to keep the reverse shock newtonian .",
    "the shock becomes mildly relativistic only when it just crosses the shell at @xmath28 .",
    "the typical burst energy is about @xmath29 ergs .",
    "the ism density has a typical values of @xmath30  protons/@xmath31 .",
    "the thick solid line in figure [ fig : eta_delta ] separates the thick shell case ( upper right ) and the thin shell case ( lower left ) . according to the internal shocks model the duration of a grb @xmath32",
    "is given by the shell width @xmath33 , the thick shell cases correspond to relatively long bursts .      in a thick shell case",
    "the reverse shock becomes relativistic at @xmath34 and it begins to decelerate the shell material . since the shell density decreases with radius as @xmath35 , using equation [ eq : delta ] , one finds that the number of shocked electrons @xmath36 is proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "the scalings of the hydrodynamic variables in terms of the observer time @xmath38 are @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total number of electrons in the shell .",
    "note that the lorentz factor @xmath15 does not depend on its initial value @xmath2 after the reverse shock becomes relativistic .    after the shock crosses the shell at @xmath41 , the profile of the forward shocked ism begins to approach the blandford - mckee ( bm ) solution ( kobayashi , piran & sari 1999 ) .",
    "since the shocked shell is located not too far behind the forward shock , it roughly fits the bm solution .",
    "the author and sari ( 1999 ) numerically showed that the evolution is well approximated by the bm solution if the relativistic reverse shock can heat the shell to a relativistic temperature .",
    "then , we apply the bm scalings to the evolution of the shocked shell .",
    "the number of the shocked electrons is constant after the shock crossing because no electron is newly shocked .",
    "@xmath42      in a thin shell case the reverse shock is too weak to decelerate the shell effectively , the lorentz factor of the shocked shell material is almost constant during the shock propagates in the shell . due to a slight difference of the velocity inside the shell ,",
    "the shell begins to spread as @xmath43 around @xmath44 .",
    "then , the density ratio decreases as @xmath45 .",
    "the scalings before the shock crosses the whole shell at @xmath46 are given by @xmath47 in the above thick shell case the spreading effect was not important since it happens after the shock crossing .",
    "the newtonian reverse shock can not heat the shell to a relativistic temperature which the bm solution assumes , then , we are not able to use the bm solution .",
    "however , we derived scaling laws for a cold shocked shell , assuming that the lorentz factor is described by a power law @xmath48 and that the shell expands adiabatically @xmath49 with a sound speed @xmath50 in the shell s comoving frame .",
    "we numerically showed that the scalings with @xmath51 fit the evolution ( kobayashi & sari 2000 ) . @xmath52",
    "we consider now the synchrotron emission from a reverse shocked shell .",
    "the shock accelerates electrons in the shell material into a power law distribution : @xmath53 . assuming that a constant fraction @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the internal energy go into the electrons and the magnetic field respectively",
    ", one finds that the typical random lorentz factor of the electrons and the magnetic field evolve as @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the spectrum is given by the broken power laws discussed in sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 ) .",
    "in this paper we neglect the self absorption since it does not affect the optical radiation in which we are interested .",
    "then , it has two breaks at the typical synchrotron frequency @xmath58 and at the cooling frequency @xmath59 which is the synchrotron frequency of electrons that cool on the dynamical time of the system .",
    "the peak flux is obtained at the lower of the two frequencies .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath60 be the total number of the shocked electrons and the distance to the observer respectively .",
    "the observed peak flux density evolves as @xmath61 .",
    "the spectra do not depend on the hydrodynamics of the shell .",
    "however , the light curve at a fixed frequency depends on the temporal evolution of the break frequencies @xmath62 and @xmath63 and the peak power @xmath64 .",
    "these depend on how @xmath65 and @xmath36 scale as a function of @xmath66 .",
    "we will apply the adiabatic evolution discussed in section 2 to the shell evolution .",
    "it is justified if the fraction of the energy going to the electron is small @xmath67 or if we are in the regime of slow cooling @xmath68 where the electrons forming the bulk of the population do not cool .",
    "a reverse shock crosses a thick shell at @xmath69 , the peak time of the emission from the reverse shock is comparable to the grb duration @xmath32 . using the estimates in section 2",
    "we obtain the break frequencies and the peak flux at the shock crossing time , @xmath70 where we have scaled the parameters as @xmath71ergs , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 sec and @xmath77 cm .",
    "the equipartition values @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80  protons/@xmath31 are inferred for grb  970508 ( wijers & galama , 1999 ; granot , piran & sari 1999 ) . the scalings before and after the shock crossing are given by @xmath81 it is interesting that @xmath62 is constant during the shock crossing .",
    "the spectrum is the slow cooling throughout the evolution if @xmath68 at @xmath32 .",
    "the shaded region in figure [ fig : eta_delta ] shows the corresponding parameter region .",
    "the flux at a given frequency @xmath82 evolves as @xmath83 the flux at a frequency above @xmath63 disappears at @xmath32 because no electron is shocked anymore .",
    "this cut off frequency @xmath84 decreases as @xmath85 due to the adiabatic expansion of the fluid .",
    "the index @xmath86 is @xmath87 for the standard choice @xmath88 .",
    "the light curves are different among three frequency regimes separated by the two frequency , @xmath62 and @xmath63 at @xmath32 .",
    "the typical light curves are shown in figure [ fig : lc_long]a .",
    "the flux initially increases at all frequencies as @xmath89 , but the high frequency light curve flats when the cooling frequency crosses the given frequency . at @xmath32",
    ", the flux begins to decay as @xmath90 or @xmath91 .",
    "finally it vanishes when @xmath84 crosses the given frequency @xmath82 at @xmath92    with a parameter set in the upper right region of the dashed line in figure [ fig : eta_delta ] , the spectrum changes from the slow cooling to the fast cooling during the shock crossing .",
    "the light curves are different among three frequency regimes separated by @xmath62 and @xmath63 at @xmath32 .",
    "the typical light curves are shown in figure [ fig : lc_long]b .",
    "we neglected the initial slow cooling phase in the figure since the transition happens at very early time .",
    "the flux at a given frequency above @xmath63 is constant and below @xmath63 it increases as @xmath93 .",
    "when the shock crosses the shell , above @xmath63 it vanishes .",
    "after that , below @xmath63 it decreases as @xmath90 until @xmath84 crosses the given frequency .      as a thin shell case , the shell width @xmath33 should be smaller than @xmath94 .",
    "then , separation is expected between the grb and the peak of the emission .",
    "the corresponding parameter region is lower left of the solid line in figure [ fig : eta_delta ] .",
    "the break frequencies and the peak flux at @xmath95 are given by @xmath96 note that these do not depend on the initial shell width @xmath3 itself though @xmath33 should be smaller than @xmath94 .",
    "the scalings before and after @xmath94 are as follows , @xmath97    if the spectrum is the slow cooling throughout the evolution , the behavior of the light curves are different among the three frequency regimes separated by @xmath62 and @xmath63 at @xmath94 .",
    "figure [ fig : lc_short]a shows typical light curves .",
    "the flux initially increases in all regimes very rapidly as @xmath98 for @xmath88 ) .",
    "the slope changes when @xmath62 or @xmath63 crosses the given frequency .",
    "after @xmath94 , the flux decays as @xmath99 or @xmath100 for @xmath88 ) .",
    "the emission at a frequency @xmath101 disappears when the cut off frequency crosses it at @xmath102    if @xmath62 is higher than @xmath63 at @xmath94 , the spectrum changes from the slow cooling to the fast cooling during the shock crossing .",
    "however , it requires a large lorentz factor @xmath103 .",
    "then , the transition happens only if the shell is extremely thin ( see figure [ fig : eta_delta ] ) , then it is hard to detect such a prompt emission .",
    "we show the possible light curves for completeness .",
    "the behavior is different among the following four frequency regimes : @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the transition time from the slow cooling to the fast cooling .",
    "the typical light curves are shown in figure [ fig : lc_short]b in which the very early slow cooling phase is neglected .",
    "we in this section compare our estimates with the rotse observations .",
    "first , we determine the parameters of the fireball of grb  990123 from the observations .",
    "then , we make some comments on the lack of the prompt optical emission from grb  981121 and grb  991223 in the context of our model .",
    "grb  990123 is a very bright burst which fluence is about 100 times that of a median batse burst .",
    "absorption lines in the optical afterglow gives a lower limit of the redshift @xmath110 , the energy required to produce the bright grb is enormous , @xmath111 ergs for an isotropic emission .",
    "rotse detected a strong optical flash during the burst ( akerlof et al .",
    "1999 ) . about @xmath112 sec after the grb trigger , it reached to a peak of @xmath113 jy and then decayed with a slope of a power law index @xmath114 .",
    "the fireball of grb  990123 is likely to be a marginal case ( kobayashi & sari 2000 ) .",
    "however , such a marginal case behaves very much like the thin shell case , since the shell heated by a mildly relativistic shock becomes cold soon . the observed decay is in good agreement with the theory @xmath115 .",
    "this means that the relation among @xmath62 , @xmath63 and the observed optical frequency @xmath116 hz is @xmath117 at the peak time .",
    "furthermore , the strong optical emission implies that @xmath118 is close to @xmath62 ( sari & piran 1999b ) .",
    "it is well - known that the peak time @xmath119 is sensitive to the lorentz factor of the shell , so we obtain @xmath120 . since the reverse shock is mildly relativistic , the lorentz factor at the peak time should be close to the initial lorentz factor which can be estimated by using equation [ eq : dis ] .",
    "the last detection of the optical flash by rotse was @xmath121 sec after the grb trigger . using the equality of the lorentz factors , we obtains @xmath122 and @xmath123 protons/@xmath31 . with these parameters the typical synchrotron frequency at the peak time",
    "is @xmath124 hz which is close to @xmath118 and it is consistent with the initial assumption .    though we can not give a strong argument on the raising part of the light curve",
    "since the observation is sparse , the power law index of the slope calculated from the first two rotse data is 3.4 .",
    "the sparseness can make only the index smaller , then the real index is at least larger than that of a thick shell .",
    "the theory succeeded for grb  990123 , but the optical flash was detected only for it so far .",
    "akerlof et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported no detections of the optical flashes to six grbs with localization errors of 1 deg@xmath125 or better .",
    "especially , grb  981121 and grb  981223 are the most sensitive bursts in the sample . if the optical flashes are correlated with the grb fluences , the optical emission should be more than 2 mag over the rotse detection thresholds . the thick lines in figure [ fig:981121]a and [ fig:981223]a show the light curves expected from the grb fluences , @xmath126 ergs/@xmath127 , @xmath128 ergs/@xmath127 and @xmath129 ergs/@xmath127 ( akerlof et al . 2000 ) .",
    "grbs are produced by the internal shocks , while the afterglows and the optical flashes are due to the external shocks .",
    "the lack of a direct scaling between the grb and the afterglow is an evidence of the internal shocks model .",
    "however , the energy radiated in the grb phase @xmath130 is still correlated with the blast wave energy @xmath1 estimated from the x - ray afterglow ( freedman and waxman 1999 ) . according to their analysis , the ratios @xmath131 of 13 events are in between 0.1 and 6 , while @xmath132 ranges from @xmath133 ergs to @xmath134 ergs .",
    "furthermore , @xmath135 of grb  990123 is a relatively large value in the sample .",
    "therefore , the scaling with the grb fluence does not overestimate @xmath136 in general .",
    "grb  990123 was an exceptionally energetic burst .",
    "the energies of grb  981121 and grb  981223 should be considerably lower to explain the lower fluences , otherwise the sources are extremely far , z=10 for grb  981121 and z=6.5 for grb  981223 assuming @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "hereafter we assume @xmath139 ergs for the two bursts .",
    "since grb  990123 is a marginal case , a burst with a lower e and a comparable @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath32 is classified into the thick shell case in which @xmath64 is proportional to @xmath140 instead of @xmath1 .",
    "then , the peak flux for @xmath139 ergs is lower by a factor of @xmath141 than that just scaled by the grb fluence .",
    "the thin lines in figure [ fig:981121]a and [ fig:981223]a depict the corrected light curves which are still above the thresholds .",
    "the durations of grb  981121 and grb  981223 are 54 sec and 30 sec respectively and comparable to that of grb  990123 .",
    "a possible solution to the problem is to assume that the reverse shock energy is radiated at a non - optical frequency , @xmath142 or @xmath143 .",
    "the typical frequency @xmath62 is proportional to @xmath144 , but the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 are determined by the micro - physics and are likely to be universal .",
    "the difference of @xmath62 should be due to that @xmath4 and @xmath2 of the bursts are different from the `` canonical '' values , @xmath145 protons/@xmath31 and @xmath146 .",
    "if @xmath4 and @xmath2 are smaller than the canonical values , @xmath62 is lower than @xmath118 since @xmath147 for grb  990123 . using the normalization by the grb fluence ,",
    "the peak flux is @xmath148 where the subscript 0 denotes that the parameters are scaled by the values of grb  990123 , @xmath149 ergs @xmath150 , @xmath151 ergs , @xmath152 sec , @xmath153 protons @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the fireball is classified into the thin shell case if we assume very small @xmath4 or @xmath2 , thus the dependence of the peak flux on @xmath4 and @xmath2 changes to @xmath156 .",
    "@xmath157 and @xmath64 at the peak time are plotted in figure [ fig : peak ] as functions of @xmath2 and @xmath4 in the case of grb  981121 .",
    "the no detections by rotse give upper limits on @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "assuming @xmath145 protons/@xmath31 , we get @xmath158 for grb  981121 and @xmath159 for grb  981223 , or assuming @xmath146 , @xmath160 protons/@xmath31 for grb  981121 and @xmath161 protons/@xmath31 for grb  981223 .",
    "the light curves with a low @xmath4 or @xmath2 are shown as the thin lines in figure [ fig:981121]b , c and [ fig:981223 ] b , c .",
    "if we assume a larger @xmath4 or @xmath2 than the canonical values , the peak flux is given by @xmath162 the spectrum changes to the fast cooling if @xmath4 or @xmath2 is very large , the dependence on @xmath4 and @xmath2 changes to @xmath163 .",
    "for a further larger @xmath4 , @xmath63 can be lower than @xmath118 , then the dependence becomes @xmath164 .",
    "the no detections give lower limits , assuming @xmath145 protons/@xmath31 , @xmath165 for grb  981121 and @xmath166 for grb  981223 , or assuming @xmath146 , @xmath167 protons/@xmath31 for grb  981121 and @xmath168 protons/@xmath31 for grb  981223 .",
    "the light curves for a large @xmath4 or @xmath2 are shown as the thick lines in figure [ fig:981121]b , c and [ fig:981223]b , c .",
    "a large ism density is an unlikely reason to explain the no detections , because we need to require several order larger density than the canonical and with the large density the peak power @xmath64 itself is very large ( see figure [ fig : peak]b ) .",
    "however , there is a possibility of the extinction .",
    "though we have normalized the optical flux according to the grb fluence , gamma - rays do not suffer any kind of extinction .",
    "a half of x - ray afterglow bursts do not have optical afterglows , it might be due to the extinction .",
    "the reverse shock radiates at a closer region to the inner engine , it might be crucial . within the six bursts",
    "to which the rotse group reported the no detections , only the location of grb  980329 was determined precisely by bepposax , and the optical afterglows were observed hours later .",
    "however , the rotse observation on this burst was not so sensitive .",
    "future observations will provide some information to this effect .",
    "we have constructed the full light curves of the reverse shock emission for a short burst ( thin shell ) and a long burst ( thick shell ) .",
    "the typical synchrotron frequency increases rapidly as @xmath169 in the thin shell case while it is constant in the thick shell case . for a plausible moderate lorentz factor ,",
    "upto a few thousand , the synchrotron spectrum is the slow cooling throughout the evolution , with which spectrum we find that the flux must rise initially steeply as @xmath170 or @xmath171 in the thin shell case , and slowly as @xmath89 in the thick shell case .",
    "the rise ends when the reverse shock crosses the shell .",
    "only the exception is the low frequency emission from a thin shell which already begins to decrease when the rapidly changing typical frequency crosses the observe one . in the decay phase ,",
    "the light curves are similar for both cases , though the hydrodynamics are very different .",
    "then , the detection before the peak should be more useful to give a constraint on the initial properties of the fireball .    the prompt optical emission from grb  990123 is well described by the reverse shock emission .",
    "the observations enabled us to determine the initial lorentz factor and the ism density .",
    "we found that grb  990123 is a `` luck '' burst .",
    "besides the exceptionally large energy , it has an optimized lorentz factor to produce a bright optical flash . as the initial lorentz factor increases , the peak power , @xmath172 , initially rises .",
    "however , with a moderate initial lorentz factor the evolution changes to the thick shell case in which the lorentz factor at the peak time no longer depends on the initial lorentz factor . then , the peak power drops since the number of the electrons in the shell continues to decrease",
    ". therefore , the marginal case gives the brightest emission .",
    "grb  990123 is the marginal case and the typical frequency @xmath173 just comes to the optical band .",
    "the lack of the prompt optical detections by rotse for grb  981121 and grb  981223 does not give strong constraints on the initial lorentz factors or the ism densities . if the lorentz factor is slightly different from that of grb  990123 , the peak flux becomes lower than the rotse thresholds .",
    "it is also possible to explain the no detections by a lower ism density .      * references*akerlof , c.w .",
