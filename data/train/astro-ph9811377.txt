    "ngc 4736 ( messier 94 ) is a nearby , face - on spiral galaxy of morphological type sab , located in a sub - group of the coma - sculptor cloud of galaxies at a distance of 4.3 mpc ( tully 1988 ) .",
    "studies over a range of wavebands have helped define the distinctive morphological properties of this galaxy .",
    "for example , using optical and observations bosma , van der hulst & sullivan ( 1977 ) identify five separate annular regions namely ( i ) a bright central region ( the bulge ) , within a radius , @xmath7 ; ( ii ) an inner spiral structure , @xmath8 , which is bounded by a bright inner ring ; ( iii ) an outer spiral structure , @xmath9 , forming an outer disc ; ( iv ) a zone of low surface brightness and ( v ) a faint outer ring at @xmath10 .",
    "buta ( 1988 ) first identified the bright inner ring as a circumnuclear star - formation region . in the h@xmath11 observations of pogge ( 1989 )",
    ", the ring appears oval with a slight extension along the south - east to north - west axis , and to be clumpy in nature .",
    "the ring structure is also prominent in ( mulder & van driel 1993 ) , in molecular gas ( gerin , casoli & combes 1991 ) and in the far infrared ( smith 1991 ) .",
    "further evidence for an active environment comes from the 6 cm radio continuum observations of turner & ho ( 1994 ) , who observe a series of non - thermal emission sources coincident with the ring which are probably associated with recent supernovae ( rsn ) or supernova remnants ( snr ) .",
    "the morphology of the bright central region of ngc 4736 has been studied in detail using surface photometry in the visual , nir and bands by mllenhoff , matthias & gerhard ( 1995 ) , who found evidence for a weak nuclear bar of size @xmath12 aligned roughly along a north - south axis .",
    "however , most studies of the nucleus have focussed on spectroscopic data which reveal the presence of a low - ionisation nuclear emission - line region ( liner , heckman , balick & crane 1980 ) . here",
    "the debate centres on whether the emission line spectrum is powered by a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) or is the result of shock excitation and/or photoionisation from young , hot stars .",
    "filippenko & sargent ( 1985 ) re - classified the source as a _ transition _ liner since the low - ionisation nuclear emission lines are interspersed with emission lines characteristic of star - formation .",
    "this is confirmed by the study of larkin ( 1998 ) , who investigated the near - infrared spectra of a sample of liner galaxies , and found ngc 4736 to show the strongest feii / pa@xmath13 line ratio of any of their sample , suggesting that , at least in this waveband , star - formation is the dominant process . in fact , the presence of a llagn in ngc 4736 is called into question on the basis of several observations .",
    "most particularly , the absorption - corrected luminosity in the central ( 37 pc @xmath14 60 pc ) region of the nucleus may be accounted for by the presence of just six o6 stars ( taniguchi 1996 ) .",
    "also , the far - infrared emission , which is peaked at the position of the nucleus , may be powered solely by the emission of non - ob stars ( smith 1991 ; smith 1994 ) , and excludes the presence of an agn unless the absorption of the nucleus was underestimated by the authors .",
    "thus it has been suggested by taniguchi ( 1996 ) that ngc 4736 is a `` post - starburst '' galactic nucleus , an example of a liner created in the absence of agn activity .    despite the arguments cited above",
    ", a llagn may still exist at the heart of ngc 4736 .",
    "for example , turner & ho ( 1994 ) have observed a strong non - thermal radio continuum source at the position of the nucleus , which they identify as an agn candidate .",
    "also , in the recent survey of nearby galactic nuclei of ho , filippenko & sargent ( 1997 ) , the central 40 pc @xmath14 80 pc region of the nucleus is classified as a _ pure _ liner region , which again has been taken as evidence for an agn ( ho , filippenko & sargent 1998 ) .",
    "more compellingly , _ hubble space telescope _",
    "uv observations of the nucleus of ngc 4736 ( maoz 1995 ) reveal a bright point source surrounded by diffuse emission at the exact optical nucleus position . this source is seen to have a point - like companion source of equal brightness at a distance of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 pc ) directly north of the first source .",
    "although both sources may be compact star clusters , an alternative possibility is that ngc 4736 contains not one but _ two _ supermassive black holes that are in the process of merging .",
    "this idea is discussed by taniguchi & wada ( 1996 ) , who model the effect of a galaxy merger between a main galaxy and a nucleated satellite galaxy .",
    "such a merger may create a supermassive black hole binary in the nucleus of the main galaxy , which can trigger a starburst and bow shocks consistent with what is seen in ngc 4736 .",
    "a galaxy merger may also create the ring structure seen in ngc 4736 , the most famous example of such an event being the `` cartwheel '' galaxy ( struck 1996 ) . in this scenario , the weak liner spectrum and low and far - infrared emission in the nucleus",
    "may then be explained by the post - starburst nucleus containing a llagn in a relatively quiescent state .",
    "one way of progressing the debate concerning the origin of the liner in ngc 4736 is to consider the x - ray properties of the source .",
    "the most detailed study of ngc 4736 in the high energy band is that reported by cui , feldkhun & braun ( 1997 ) who have analysed a deep pointed observation carried out with the x - ray telescope / position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) .",
    "they found evidence for an extended distribution of hot ( @xmath17 kev ) gas within the central few kiloparsec region of ngc 4736 , in addition to a compact , relative low luminosity ( @xmath18 , 0.1 - 2 kev ) nuclear x - ray source .",
    "clearly , a plausible interpretation is that this compact x - ray source corresponds to a llagn , although other explanations are possible .",
    "cui ( 1997 ) also report the detection of a further point - like source offset by @xmath19 from the compact nuclear source , which is perhaps best explained as a bright x - ray transient in ngc 4736 .",
    "subsequent to the pspc observation ngc 4736 has been the subject of further study in the x - ray regime .",
    "specifically it has been observed on two occasions with the high resolution imager ( hri ) and also once by . in this paper",
    "we utilize all the available datasets from and to further investigate both the discrete x - ray source population in ngc 4736 and the nature of its central x - ray source . the next section briefly describes the set of observations and the techniques we have employed to reduce the data .",
    "section 3 then focusses on the discrete x - ray sources detected in the various images of ngc 4736 , whereas in section 4 we present the results pertaining to the spatial , spectral and temporal properties of its nuclear emission . finally in section 5",
    "we return to the question of whether the liner nucleus of ngc 4736 harbours a llagn or is powered entirely by star - formation processes .",
    "details of the and observations of ngc 4736 used in the present paper are given in table  [ 4736obs ] .",
    "the preliminary processing of the pspc data involved excluding time intervals when the charged - particle master - veto rate was in excess of @xmath20 . this resulted in the rejection of 11% of the raw data , leaving @xmath21 ks of `` clean '' data . for the spatial and temporal analysis",
    "the pspc data were divided into a soft band ( corresponding to pi channels 1141 and energy range 0.10.4 kev ) and a hard band ( pi channels 52200 and energy range 0.52 kev ) .",
    "preliminary images in both bands were produced on a @xmath22 spatial grid .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath23 @xmath24 + @xmath25 @xmath26 + @xmath27 kev + @xmath28 ev + @xmath29 xspec units + @xmath30 parameter value fixed + [ 4736allfits ]         as a final step in the spectral fitting the pspc spectrum was also included in the analysis on the basis of the same spectral model as employed for the spectra ( allowing no spectral or continuum variability in ngc 4736 between the two observation epochs ) . this demonstrated the need for a further ( ultra - soft ) spectral component ( see figure  [ 4736spec](a ) ) , which we have modelled in terms of a second softer raymond - smith component . again assuming a solar - abundance plasma we find that a temperature of @xmath31 kev provides a good match to the spectral data .",
    "however , even after the addition of this new component to the spectral model , the @xmath32 residuals in the fit suggested a considerable divergence between the and pspc data in the 0.61 kev range ( figure  [ 4736spec](b ) ) .",
    "after various trials it was found that a greatly improved @xmath32 could be achieved by the addition of a further narrow gaussian line component at @xmath33 kev , fitted only to the pspc data ( resulting in @xmath34 ) .",
    "the resulting fit parameters are given in table  [ 4736allfits ] as model 3 ( see also figure  [ 4736spec](c ) ) .",
    "this line component may represent some form of contamination of the pspc spectrum not removed in the background subtraction process ( for example , cui , feldkhun & braun ( 1997 ) note that solar scattered x - rays are a particular problem in this pspc observation ) or alternatively may be a by - product ( in terms of the spectral - fitting ) of a cross - calibration error between and .",
    "the above spectral fitting analysis establishes that both a hard continuum component ( @xmath35 or @xmath36 kev ) and softer thermal emission , characterised by temperatures in the range @xmath37 kev , are present in the nuclear region of ngc 4736 .",
    "unfortunately , apart from the detection of the iron - line emission , there is insufficient signal to noise and spectral resolution to define the spectral characteristics in any greater detail .",
    "thus , although we have assumed solar - abundance in the hot gas , equally good fits can be obtained if the abundance is dropped to 0.1 solar .",
    "similarly it is not possible to constrain the line of sight column on the hard continuum ( beyond the assumption of galactic @xmath38 ) since any intrinsic absorption is effectively masked by the soft thermal emission .",
    "the observations do confirm , however , that there was no very significant change in the level of the hard component between the epochs of the pspc and observations to the hard spectral emission detected in the pspc observation ; thus the flux comparison is reliable to no better than about @xmath39 . ] .",
    "it is informative to examine the derived spectral model in relation to the the spatial structure of the nuclear region established earlier . hypothesizing that the extended emission is represented in the spectral model by the raymond - smith components , and the nuclear point source by the power - law continuum",
    ", then we predict , on the basis of the spectral model , that @xmath40 of the photons in the 0.10.4 kev band and @xmath41 in the 0.52 kev band are associated with the nuclear point source . by comparison",
    "the fractions determined from the spatial analysis are @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( but with the possibility that the former is somewhat of an over - estimate given the form of the radial distribution measured in the pspc soft band , see figure  [ 4736radprofs](a ) ) .",
    "the implication is that the above division is at least plausible .",
    "conversely , the presence of a bright point - source in the soft - band pspc image argues against any significant intrinsic absorption of the hard continuum , although there is insufficent information to rule out more `` contrived '' spectral / spatial models .",
    "an analysis of all of the available observations reveals no evidence for any significant short - term temporal variability , over periods of tens of minutes to a few days , in the x - ray flux from the nuclear source in ngc 4736 ( cui 1997 ) .",
    "also , as noted earlier , the spectral analysis is consistent with the level of the hard continuum component remaining unchanged between the pspc and observations , which were separated by a time interval of 4 years .",
    "a final check for temporal variability was possible by comparing the count rates measured for the unresolved central source in the spatial analysis of the hard - band pspc data and the hria and hrib observations . specifically , assuming that this nuclear point source is the origin of the hard continuum identified in the spectral analysis , we have used the pimms package ( mukai 1996 ) to convert the measured count - rates into fluxes .",
    "the count rates associated with the point source in the three cases convert to 0.52 kev fluxes of @xmath44 , 1.2 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "any long term variability implied by these measurements is therefore at an amplitude @xmath46 .",
    "x - ray observations can , in principle , provide crucial information relating to the question of whether galaxies classified as liners generally harbour llagn at their centres . in the case of ngc 4736 , our analysis of the x - ray emission from its nuclear region confirms the presence of a bright x - ray point source coincident with the optical nucleus .",
    "we associate this compact source with the hard continuum evident in the 210 kev band . modelled as a power - law",
    ", the luminosity of this hard continuum is @xmath47 in the 0.52 kev band , and @xmath48 in the 210 kev range .",
    "the measured slope of the power - law corresponds to a photon spectral index @xmath35 , which is fairly typical of seyfert 1 galaxies in the 210 kev band ( e.g. turner & pounds 1989 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "thus , taking into account the lack of any clear signature of continuum absorption , a possible interpretation of the ngc 4736 x - ray spectrum is that in the x - ray regime we have a direct view of a llagn which , apparently , is in a near quiescent state ( in that the observed luminosity is a factor @xmath49 lower than is typically of seyfert nuclei ) .",
    "the existence of active galactic nuclei with very low x - ray luminosities is now well established ( e.g. m 81 , ishisaki 1996 ; ngc 4258 , makashima 1994 ; ngc 3147 , ptak 1996 ; m51 terashima 1998a ) and in the most extreme case reported to date , namely that of ngc 4395 , the dwarf seyfert nucleus was found to have an @xmath50 of only @xmath51 ( lira 1998 ) .    in order to confirm the supposition that the liner nucleus in ngc 4736 contains a llagn",
    "it is necessary to consider what further clues are provided by the x - ray data .",
    "support for the presence of a llagn could in principle come from the observation of significant continuum variability .",
    "if llagn are the direct low - luminosity analogue of the classical seyfert phenomenon then the trend of increasing variability with decreasing luminosity displayed in seyfert galaxies ( nandra 1997a ) would predict llagn to be highly variable x - ray sources .",
    "this property is not apparent in the sample of llagn and liners studied by ptak ( 1998 ) , although m 81 and ngc 4395 do vary on a timescale of @xmath52 weeks .",
    "ptak ( 1998 ) argue that since llagn must be accreting at grossly sub - eddington rates , they are likely to be powered by an advection - dominated accretion flow ( narayan & yi 1995 ) , a scenario in which rapid x - ray variability can be suppressed . in any event , it is not possible to use the absence of x - ray temporal variability in ngc 4736 on timescales of @xmath52 hours to days as a strong argument either for or against the llagn hypothesis .",
    "potentially the most important clue we have as to the origin of the hard x - ray emission is provided by the detection of the fe k@xmath3 emission line , with recent results from amply demonstrating the diagnostic possibilities of such features ( nandra 1997a ) . in the case of ngc 4736",
    "we detect ( albeit at marginal significance ) a fe - k line with a high equivalent width ( @xmath53 ev ) at an energy inconsistent with the fluorescence in cold gas .",
    "the most obvious explanation of the large equivalent width , by analogy to the situation pertaining in classical seyfert 2 galaxies such as ngc 1068 ( see antonucci 1993 ) , is that the direct to the central engine is completely blocked , perhaps by a molecular torus , but nevertheless we see a fraction of the nuclear flux as a result of electron scattering .",
    "this scattering occurs in a photoionised medium which extends sufficiently far from the nucleus , probably along an axial direction , so as to be visible above the plane of the obscuring medium .",
    "typically up to a few percent of the nuclear continuum can be redirected into our line of sight and a substantial fe - k line feature is superimposed due to the fluorescence of the scattering medium .",
    "iron line equivalent widths greater than 1 kev can be produced by this means ( makashima 1985 ) , with the line energy providing a measure of the ionisation state of the electron scattering region .",
    "for example , at least two _ high energy _",
    "fe - k components are detected with high equivalent width in the x - ray spectrum of ngc 1068 , indicative of the presence of a warm scattering medium ( marshall 1993 ; ueno 1994 ; iwasawa , fabian & matt 1997 ) .    in the case of ngc 4736 ,",
    "the combination of the observed fe - k feature , the absence of temporal variability and the lack of any clear signature of continuum absorption constitute circumstantial evidence in favour of a scattering scenario ( with the implication that the direct nuclear emission is blocked by a column density well in excess of @xmath54 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the `` hidden '' llagn might then be close to @xmath55 ( if we assume a scattered fraction of roughly @xmath56 of the total nuclear continuum ) .",
    "a test of whether ngc 4736 might harbour such an `` unseen '' type-2 nucleus is provided by reference to its far - infrared flux .",
    "david ( 1992 ) derive a linear relationship between the fir luminosity ( based on 60 and 100 micron fluxes ) and the ( 0.54.5 kev ) x - ray luminosities of a sample of normal , starburst and liner galaxies",
    ". applied to ngc 4736 , the david formula predicts an expected x - ray luminosity of @xmath57 in close agreement to that actually observed . in principle",
    "this argues against _ any _ llagn presence in ngc 4736 , but given the scatter in the david correlation , it remains a reasonable conjecture that a llagn at a `` quiescent '' level of a few times @xmath58 has escaped detection in other wavebands .",
    "however , the requirements for a much more luminous hidden llagn look implausible .",
    "similarly the observed l@xmath59}/l_x$ ] ratio for ngc 4736 is much closer to the norm for unobscured seyfert nuclei than for galaxies with hidden seyfert nuclei such as ngc 1068 ( mulchaey 1994 ) .",
    "unfortunately in the quiescent llagn scenario we are left with the problem of how to explain both the observed energy and equivalent width of the fe k@xmath3 line .",
    "terashima 1998b discuss the relevant arguments in the context of the liner galaxy ngc 4579 , which also has a strong he - like iron fe - k line in its spectrum .",
    "there is of course an alternative to the llagn hypothesis , namely that all of x - ray flux emanating from nuclear point source in ngc 4736 is generated by stellar mass objects in the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "given the relatively hard spectrum , the most likely population would seem to be low and/or high mass x - ray binaries ( xrb ) ( see fabbiano 1989 ; makishima 1989 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath60 xrb concentrated in the nucleus of the galaxy , powered at near to their eddington limit by accretion onto a neutron star or stellar mass black - hole , could produce both the observed x - ray luminosity and the hard spectral form .",
    "also in this model , since the observed x - ray flux is due to the integrated emission of a reasonable number of separate sources , a substantial amplitude of variability is not expected .",
    "the one major difficulty with this description is in explaining the apparently large equivalent width of the fe k line in ngc 4736 , since individual xrb tend to have fe k lines with equivalent widths of only a few tens of ev ( hirano 1987 ) , which is well outside the formal @xmath61 confidence range of the measurement . as a check of the xrb model we can utilize the fact that , in the absence of an agn , the optical luminosity of a spiral galaxy bulge is often well correlated with its x - ray luminosity due to its population of xrbs ( canizares , fabbiano & trinchieri 1987 ) . in the case of ngc 4736",
    "this method predicts , on the basis of the optical magnitude of the bulge of ngc 4736 ( @xmath62 ; ho , filippenko & sargent 1997 ) and figure 5 of iyomoto ( 1998 ) , an x - ray luminosity of @xmath63 , which is a factor four below that observed .",
    "however , an over - density of xrbs , particularly in a region characterised by recent intense starburst activity , perhaps with an xrb population biassed toward high mass systems , can not be excluded ,    an interesting feature of bright nuclear x - ray source in ngc 4736 is that over a third of the x - ray emission below 2 kev is resolved with a radial extent of @xmath64 , _ i.e. _ @xmath0 kpc .",
    "we associate this extended emission with the two thermal components identified in the spectral analysis with temperatures of @xmath65 and @xmath66 kev , which have a combined luminosity of @xmath47 in the 0.12 kev pspc band . the observed thermal emission",
    "is largely confined within the bright circumnuclear ring of star - forming regions identified in and other wavebands .",
    "a possible origin of this hot gas is in a starburst event ( or events ) which have occurred in the nucleus of ngc 4736 .",
    "hydrodynamic modelling of starbursts ( suchkov 1994 ; tenerio - tagle & muoz - tun 1997 ) has been broadly successful in duplicating the results of x - ray observations that show kpc scale `` plumes '' of hot x - ray emitting gas escaping from the disc into the halo of galaxies experiencing nuclear starbursts ( ngc 253 , pietsch & trmper 1993 ) . for the hotter plasma observed we derive a volume emissivity of @xmath67 ( assuming spherical symmetry and a concentration of the emission within a radius of @xmath68 ) , an electron density of @xmath69 and a cooling time of @xmath70 ( tucker 1975 ) .",
    "hence the hot extended plasma component may indeed have had its origin in a recent starburst epoch .",
    "unfortunately , the modelling of the soft x - ray excess observed in ngc 4736 in terms of two specific temperature components may not represent an accurate picture of the state of the hot plasma in this galaxy .",
    "a variety of effects such as a departure from non solar - abundances , a smooth spread of temperature values and non - equilibrium conditions in the plasma may have combined to mimic a two - temperature spectrum ( given the limited spectral resolution and sensitivity afford by the combined and data ) .",
    "equally well it is possible to hypothesize that the two raymond - smith components may represent two distinct spatial distributions , for example the hotter plasma could be located within the disc of the galaxy with the cooler component forming a more diffuse halo . unfortunately , the only real evidence for such a spatial segregation is given by the low - surface brightness north - south ridge of emission , evident in the soft band but not the hard band pspc image .",
    "there has been considerable recent interest in the identification of candidate llagn in the nuclei of nearby galaxies via x - ray measurements . from observations",
    "we know that many of the sources established as bona - fide llagn have broadly similar spectral characteristics to those observed in the nuclear source in ngc 4736 , namely a hard continuum , a detectable fe - k line and a softer , probably thermal component , which is prominent below 2 kev ( see serlemitsos , ptak & yaqoob 1996 ) . unfortunately , despite this apparent conformity , we are still unable to answer the key question of whether the liner nucleus in ngc 4736 contains an x - ray bright llagn with complete certainty .",
    "fortunately , we can be fairly sure that when high sensitivity x - ray observations with good spectral and spatial resolution become available from and , a definitive answer will be forthcoming .",
    "as in many areas of x - ray astrophysics , the fe - k line may well provide the crucial diagnostic .",
    "tpr acknowledges support from pparc initially in the form of a research studentship and more recently as a postdoctoral research associate .",
    "the x - ray spectral data used in this work were obtained from the leicester data archive centre ( ledas ) and the heasarc facility at goddard space flight centre , usa . the digitized sky survey was produced at the space telescope science institute , under us government grant nag w-2166 from the original national geographic - palomar sky survey plates .",

    "<S> ngc 4736 is a nearby sab spiral galaxy , hosting one of the closest examples of a liner nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> we have utilized recent observations by and to characterise the x - ray properties of this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> twelve discrete x - ray sources are detected within the region subtended by its optical disk , the majority of which are likely to be x - ray binaries associated with the galaxy . by far the brightest source in the x - ray band is positionally coincident with the nucleus of the galaxy and is spatially resolved into a component with a radial extent of @xmath0 kpc plus a point - like core . </S>",
    "<S> the broad band ( 0.110 kev ) spectrum of this nuclear source is composed of a hard continuum with a spectral slope characteristic of that observed in classical seyfert nuclei ( _ i.e. _ power - law photon index , @xmath1 ) , with thermal emission ( @xmath2 kev ) dominant below 2 kev . an fe k@xmath3 line may also be present at @xmath4 kev . there is no evidence for x - ray temporal variability on timescales of hours to years . </S>",
    "<S> a plausible model is that the hard continuum originates in a near - quiescent active galactic nucleus ( with @xmath5 , 0.510 kev ) embedded in the liner at the centre of ngc 4736 . </S>",
    "<S> however , an alternative explanation , namely that the liner is the site of a dense population of x - ray binary sources , can not be completely excluded .    0  km  s^-1  mpc^-1    25d@xmath6 250.25 kev    a&a    galaxies : individual : ngc 4736  galaxies : nuclei  x - rays : galaxies . </S>"
