    "among the low - mass x - ray binaries , soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) offer a favorable opportunity of detecting stellar - mass black - hole candidates ( bhcs ) .",
    "measurements of the binary periods and the orbital velocities of the companion stars in seven sxts yield mass functions @xmath4 for their compact stars ( mcclintock 1998 , filippenko 1999 ) . as these masses are higher than the upper limit to the mass of neutron stars for known equations of state of nucleon matter , the compact stars in sxts are all bhcs . in other two systems , the mass functions are @xmath5 but the inclination angles are thought to be sufficiently low that the compact objects can also be classified as bhcs ( mcclintock 1998 ) .",
    "sxts show transitions between different spectral states . in a simple classification",

    "gro  j1655@xmath040 was in quiescence between late 1995 august and 1996 april . in 1996",
    "march , its soft x - ray luminosity , inferred from the asca observations ( at @xmath26 kev ) , was @xmath27 erg s@xmath28 ( see orosz & bailyn 1997 ) .",
    "the source was not detected by rxte / asm ( at @xmath29 kev ) above the intensity level of @xmath30 mcrab before 1996 april 25 ( levine 1996 ; remillard 1996 ) ; it was also undetected by batse before may .",
    "on april @xmath31 ut ( hjd @xmath32 ) , the soft ( @xmath29 kev ) x - ray intensity began to rise ( remillard 1996 ) .",
    "the optical brightening , however , had already started on april 20 ( orosz 1997 ) .",

    "our spectroscopic observations were conducted between hjd @xmath45 and hjd @xmath46 ( april 20 ) , and between hjd @xmath47 and hjd @xmath48 ( april 21 ) , just after the initial rise in the optical brightness , but before the rxte / asm detected the rise in the x - ray intensity . on the first night we took a series of five 600-s spectra and one 1200-s spectrum ( although focussing problems on the red arm of the spectrograph affected the quality our red spectra ) . the binary phase during the observations was @xmath49",
    "( ephemeris of orosz & bailyn 1997 ) , and the inferior conjunction of the secondary star was at @xmath50 . on the following night , we took seven 600-s spectra , at the binary phase @xmath51 .",
    "( if we adopt the ephemeris of van der hooft ( 1998 ) , the observations were made at phase @xmath52 on the first night , and @xmath53 on the second . )",
    "the balmer and paschen lines are clearly seen in absorption in our spectra ( figures  [ fluxspectra ] and [ 96apr ] ) .",
    "the @xmath3 emission line , the bowen fluorescence @xmath54 line and the blend @xmath15 were not detected on either night .",
    "these emission lines , which are often seen from x - ray irradiated accretion disks ( smak 1981 ; horne & marsh 1986 ) , were , however , observed 20 days later ( on may 11 ) by hynes ( 1998b ) .    by comparing our spectra with the spectra of f giant and subgiant stars and with the spectra of the system taken by orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) during a quiescent state in february 1996 ,",
    "we conclude that the optical continuum emission was predominantly from the secondary star .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the agreement between the observed velocity shifts of the balmer lines in our spectra and the radial velocity of the secondary star expected at those phases ( not shown ) .",
    "in late 1996 april , a transition from quiescence to a high / soft x - ray state occurred .",
    "the soft ( @xmath29 kev ) x - ray flux ( measured by rxte / asm ) increased rapidly , reaching @xmath55  crab and remaining above that level for more than six months . around 1996",
    "november the soft x - ray intensity began to decline ; but in 1997 january it increased again ( figure  [ batse_asm ] ) .",
    "it then stayed at the @xmath56  crab level till 1997 july , after which the system entered another quiescent state .    at the initial stage of the outburst",
    "the x - ray spectrum consisted of a blackbody component and a truncated power - law tail .",
    "the black body temperature was @xmath57 kev .",
    "the photon index of the power - law tail was @xmath58 and the exponential cutoff was at @xmath59 kev ( hynes 1998b ) . around 1996 may 27  28 ( hjd 2450230  31 ) the x - ray spectrum hardened , and the source became detectable by batse ( figure  [ batse_asm ] ) .",
    "the photon index of the power - law was @xmath60 on june 20 , and there was no obvious sign of a high - energy cutoff below @xmath61  kev ( hynes 1998b ) .",
    "a radio flare was observed by the molongo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) , apparently coincident the x - ray spectral transition ( hunstead & campbell - wilson 1996 ; hunstead , wu & campbell - wilson 1997 ) .",
    "the optical continuum had increased a few days before the onset of the soft x - ray outburst ( see  3.1 ) . after reaching a peak in mid - may ,",
    "the optical brightness then declined steadily , with an e - folding time of about 50 days ( hynes 1998b ) . by august 1996",
    "it had returned to the previous quiescent level .",
    "flickerings on time - scales of a few seconds , apparently correlated with x - ray variability , were reported by hynes ( 1998a ) .",
    "our observations were carried out on june 8  12 and june 17 , during the soft x - ray outburst ( figure  [ batse_asm ] ) .",
    "we obtained fifty simultaneous red and blue spectra , each of 2000 s duration . in figure  [ 96jun ]",
    "we show two blue and red spectra taken on june 8 and june 10 .",
    "the intensity of the optical continuum in may was slightly higher than in june ( cf .",
    "hynes 1998b ) .",
    "the soft x - ray flux was similar in these two epochs ; however , the hard x - rays turned on after may 27 .",
    "the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines showed a broad absorption trough in 1996 june .",
    "the absorption component was stronger on june 8 ( ew @xmath62  , fwhm @xmath63   @xmath64 for h@xmath1 ; ew @xmath65  , fwhm @xmath63   @xmath66 for h@xmath2 ) than on the other nights .",
    "the absorption troughs were partly filled by narrower emission components ( figure  [ 96jun ] ) , which were not seen in the spectra obtained by hynes ( 1998b ) four weeks earlier .",
    "the equivalent width of the h@xmath1 emission seemed to increase with the hard x - ray flux ( figure  [ batse_ew1 ] ) .",
    "the emergence of the h@xmath1 emission component after the may 27 turn - on of the hard x - ray flux also suggests a direct association between these emissions .",
    "we have calculated the discrete correlation function , defined by edelson & krolik ( 1988 ) , for the ew of the h@xmath1 emission line and the hard x - ray flux and have found a 2-@xmath67 peak in the correlation function at the lag of @xmath68 d , for a 0.5 d interval bin ( figure  [ lag ] ) .",
    "a similar correlation is also found in our 1994 august ",
    "september data ( see  6.4.1 ) .",
    "the average h@xmath1 emission profile was double - peaked , with fwhm @xmath69 , and peak - to - peak velocity separation @xmath70 .",
    "however , the relative strength of the two peaks varied substantially over each orbital cycle ( see  4.3 ) .    the @xmath3 emission line had a double - peaked profile ( figure  [ heii_profile96 ] ) with a peak - to - peak separation of @xmath71  , corresponding to a velocity separation of @xmath72 . a double - peaked @xmath3 emission line had been detected before the x - ray hardening ( see table 6 in hynes 1998b ) : archival spectra from the anglo - australian telescope show that the peak - to - peak velocity separation was @xmath73 on 1996 may 11 . the central position of the line varied sinusoidally , with the variations consistent with the projected radial velocity of the primary star for a mass ratio @xmath74 ( soria 1998 ) , suggesting that the emission originated from the accretion disk .",
    "the average line center was blue - shifted by @xmath75 with respect to the systemic velocity determined by orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) , where the first source of error is in the determination of the line center , the second is the systematic error in the wavelength calibration .",
    "we have not found any significant correlation between the ew of the @xmath3 line and the hard x - ray flux ( figure  [ batse_ew1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath76 emission line appeared to be double - peaked , with only one peak visible at some orbital phases .",
    "the velocity separation , which was determined when the two peaks were present , varied between @xmath77 and @xmath78 over the time of our observations .",
    "these velocities are consistent with those of the h@xmath1 and the @xmath3 lines .",
    "the ew of the line was about @xmath79  .",
    "a weak narrow absorption component was also detected at @xmath76 ( not shown ) , superimposed on the broader , double - peaked emission component .",
    "the narrow absorption component was visible at most orbital phases and had an ew @xmath80   and an fwhm @xmath81   ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "a similar narrow absorption component was also found at @xmath83 .",
    "the velocity shifts of the narrow absorption components of the lines were consistent with the projected radial velocity of the secondary star ( figure  [ hei_abs ] ) , suggesting that these lines were due to absorption near the secondary star .",
    "the apparent small discrepancy between the observed and predicted velocities may be due in part to the uncertainty in our measurement of the line position , in part to additional absorption by cold gas near the rim of the accretion disk or in the accretion stream , or to a non - uniform absorption by the photosphere of the secondary star , which was strongly irradiated on the side facing the primary .",
    "we note that @xmath83 showed a stronger broad absorption component briefly on june 8 , with ew @xmath84   and fwhm @xmath85   @xmath86 .",
    "it disappeared later on the same night while the hard x - ray flux increased , and was not seen during the following nights ( see figure  [ 96jun ] ) .",
    "narrow , single - peaked @xmath54 and @xmath15 bowen fluorescence lines were observed in 1996 june . as these lines were also seen before the hard x - ray turned on [ see the spectra taken by hynes ( 1998b ) in 1996 may ] , they were probably uncorrelated with the hard x - ray flux . by comparing the bowen line profiles and radial velocity shifts with those of the @xmath3 line ,",
    "we conclude that the bowen fluorescence lines and the line originated from different regions .",
    "judging from the radial velocities shifts of the bowen lines , soria ( 1998 ) suggest that they were emitted from a localized region in the outer accretion disk , possibly a hot spot in phase with the secondary star .      among the emission lines observed in 1996 june , the h@xmath1 line had the highest signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "if we adopt a reddening @xmath87 ( hynes 1998b ) , the inferred average flux for the h@xmath1 emission line was @xmath88 erg @xmath89 s@xmath28 ( cf .   @xmath90 erg @xmath89 s@xmath28 for the @xmath3 line ) .",
    "although the ew of the h@xmath1 line appeared to be correlated with the hard x - ray flux ( figure  [ batse_ew1 ] ) , we have found that the velocity profile of the line , with its peak normalized to unity , depended only on the binary phase .",
    "the systematic variation of the h@xmath1 emission line profiles over an orbital cycle can be seen in the sequence of profiles plotted in figures  [ ha_stack1 ] , [ ha_stack2 ] and [ ha_stack3 ] .",
    "the red - shifted peak was stronger than the blue - shifted peak between phase 0.25 and 0.85 , with the blue - shifted peak dominating at other phases . by considering the averaged , normalized h@xmath1 line profiles over the whole epoch of our observations ( see figure 2 in soria 1998 ) , and the averaged profiles obtained between orbital phases 0.80 and 0.92 and between phases 0.19 and 0.28 ( figure  [ ha_avg ] ) , when the highest signal - to - noise ratio was achieved and both peaks had comparable strength , we deduce that the fwhm of the line was @xmath69 , and the peak - to - peak velocity separation was @xmath91 .",
    "these values are similar to those determined for the double - peaked and emission lines .    in principle",
    ", symmetric double - peaked lines can be produced by an accretion disk ( smak 1981 ; horne & marsh 1986 ) .",
    "as the h@xmath1 line profile changed with a period equal to the binary period , this eliminates the possibility that the line asymmetry was due to a precession of the accretion disk , which should have a period longer than the binary period ( e.g.  kumar 1986 , warner 1995 ) .",
    "neither could it be caused by the secondary star eclipsing either side of the disk , because our data show asymmetry of the two peaks even when the star was behind the accretion disk .",
    "if the emission were from the irradiatively - heated surface of the secondary star , we would expect a stronger blue component in the emission line when the star was approaching ( at phases 0.25  0.75 ) , and vice versa .",
    "this is inconsistent with the observation that the blue peak of the line was stronger at around phase 0 .",
    "therefore we reject the possibility that the secondary star was the dominant source of the emission .",
    "( see  5 for more detailed discussion on the h@xmath1 emission . )",
    "the soft x - ray flux in 1997 june was slightly lower than in 1996 june , while the hard x - ray flux was significantly lower ( figure  [ batse_asm ] ) .",
    "we observed the system on 1997 june 14 and 15 .",
    "no optical photometric observations were carried out during this period .",
    "although the conditions were not photometric , a comparison with other stars in the field led to an estimate of @xmath92 for the source , about half a magnitude fainter than in 1996 june .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission line had a red - shifted peak around phase 0.5 and a blue - shifted peak around phase 0 , as in 1996 june ; the signal - to - noise ratio was much lower than in 1996 . the velocity shifts with respect to the center of mass of the binary were @xmath93 for the red - shifted peak , and @xmath94 for the blue - shifted peak , similar to those measured in 1996 .    for the h@xmath1 line , ew @xmath95   on june 14 , and @xmath96   on june 15 .",
    "the emission component of the h@xmath2 and higher balmer lines was not detectable .",
    "the balmer emission was therefore weaker than in 1996 june .",
    "the @xmath3 line was seen in emission with ew @xmath97  , as strong as in 1996 .",
    "the bowen fluorescence lines were also detected .",
    "figure  [ plotpeaks ] shows the velocity shift of the peaks of the h@xmath1 emission component detected in the 1996 june and the 1997 june spectra .",
    "only one peak was present at some orbital phases ( cf .",
    "figures  [ ha_stack1 ] , [ ha_stack2 ] and [ ha_stack3 ] ) .",
    "the velocity separation of the peaks ( @xmath98 ) was larger than the radial velocity amplitude of the secondary star .",
    "this implies that the emission region was located within the orbit of the secondary star , thus ruling out the possibility of emission from the surface of the secondary ( see also  4.3 ) or from a circumbinary disk .",
    "according to orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) , the projected radial velocity semi - amplitude of the secondary star in gro  j1655@xmath040 is @xmath99 , and the masses of the two components are @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "if we assume a thin , non - circular , keplerian accretion disk truncated at the tidal radius , as described in paczyski ( 1977 ) , then the disk emission lines would have peaks with observed radial velocities at each phase given by the dash - dotted lines in figure  [ plotpeaks ] .",
    "the tidal truncation radius is approximately given by @xmath102 for @xmath103 ( warner 1995 ) , where @xmath104 is the separation between the centers of mass of the binary components .",
    "the peak - to - peak velocity separation averaged over an orbital cycle would be @xmath105 . phillips ( 1999 )",
    "derived lower values for the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the secondary star and for the masses of the binary components .",
    "they obtained @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( 90 per cent confidence limit ) . for a fixed mass ratio @xmath109",
    ", this implies that the peak - to - peak velocity separation averaged over an orbital cycle , expected from a tidally - truncated keplerian disk , would be @xmath110 .",
    "peak separations @xmath111 would instead be expected if we adopt the parameters determined by shahbaz ( 1999 ) , who inferred a velocity semi - amplitude @xmath112 for the companion star .",
    "the velocity separations deduced from our 1996 june and 1997 june data are lower than the predicted values , especially for the red - shifted peak at phases around 0.5 and the blue - shifted peak at phases around 0 .",
    "therefore , the double - peaked profile of the h@xmath1 emission component can not be explained by a conventional thin keplerian accretion disk truncated at the tidal radius .",
    "we note that the peak - to - peak velocity separations of @xmath3 and @xmath76 were also too small to be consistent with a tidally - truncated keplerian disk .",
    "remarkably low rotational velocities , inconsistent with keplerian disks truncated at their tidal radii , have also been inferred from the double - peaked h@xmath1 emission line profiles observed from a0620@xmath000 and gs  1124@xmath068 ( orosz 1994 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for the low rotational velocities inferred for the outer edge of the accretion disks in these three systems is that the disks extended slightly beyond their tidal radii .",
    "whitehurst 1988 ) .",
    "we have found that the observed variations in the h@xmath1 line profile can be explained by the model shown in figure  [ sectors96 ] , with two separate emission regions on the accretion disk .",
    "the model can reproduce the low radial velocities of the peaks and their behavior at various orbital phases .",
    "for example , only the red - shifted component would be visible around phase 0.5 and only the blue - shifted component around phase 1 , while both peaks would be visible around phases 0.25 and 0.75 .",
    "non - axisymmetric patterns of emission similar to our model were proposed by steeghs , harlaftis & horne ( 1997 ) to explain the balmer and helium emission line profiles observed from the dwarf nova ip peg , and by neustroev & borisov ( 1998 ) to explain the balmer line profiles observed from the dwarf nova u gem . in both cases , they were interpreted as evidence of a two - armed spiral density wave or shock in the accretion disk , induced by the tidal interaction with the companion star . in the case of ip peg , the observed rotational velocities also suggested that the disk could extend beyond its tidal radius ( steeghs 1997 ) .    it has been suggested that accretion stream overflows , hot spots , and uneven illumination of the accretion disk from the central x - ray source can also produce an anisotropic emissivity .",
    "however , it is beyond the scope of the present paper to explore in details why the balmer emission regions might assume the geometrical configuration shown in our model .",
    "furthermore , a narrow @xmath113 absorption component from the companion star is also likely to be present , as suggested by the detection of other stellar absorption features from and .",
    "it can be noticed from the radial velocity curve of the companion star that the presence of a stellar absorption line superimposed on the disk emission would also be qualitatively consistent with the observed behavior of the line profile at various orbital phases , if absorption and emission have comparable strength ( figures  [ ha_stack1 ] , [ ha_stack2 ] and [ ha_stack3 ] ) .",
    "however , we argue that the effect of anisotropic disk emission is more significant than the effect of a stellar absorption line , and can better explain the velocity shifts of the emission peaks observed over an orbital phase .",
    "one might expect the h@xmath1 emission line profiles to be roughly symmetric at superior and inferior conjunction ; however , the h@xmath1 line in general showed a red - shifted peak stronger than the blue - shifted peak , and a blue wing more extended than the red wing ( see figure  [ ha_stack1 ] and figure  [ ha_stack3 ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry of the profiles may indicate the presence of both opacity and kinematic effects , and may be evidence of a thin disk - wind .",
    "it is worth noting that p - cygni profiles were observed in some uv resonance lines from the system ( hynes 1998b ) .",
    "the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines in the spectra obtained during the 1996/1997 outburst all show broad ( fwhm @xmath114 ) , shallow absorption components .",
    "broad absorption components are also seen in the 1994 august ",
    "september spectra , when the system was in outburst ( see  6.2 ) , but not in the 1996 april spectra , when the system was in quiescence .",
    "absorption lines can be produced in an accretion disk if the disk is optically thick and its temperature decreases with height above the central plane .",
    "the absorption features seen in our spectra are broader than the emission cores : this suggests that they were probably formed in the inner part of an optically thick disk , where viscous heating from the central plane dominates over external irradiative heating .",
    "broad , shallow absorption features at the balmer lines have been seen in the spectra of other bhcs in outburst , such as a0620@xmath000 ( whelan 1977 ) , gs  1124@xmath068 ( della valle , masetti & bianchini 1998 ) and , most prominently , gro  j0422@xmath11532 ( casares 1995 ) .",
    "similar features are also often present in the spectra of ux uma stars ( e.g.  warner 1995 ) and in the outburst spectra of dwarf novae ( robinson , marsh & smak 1993 ) .",
    "double - peaked lines can be emitted from a hot temperature - inversion layer on the x - ray irradiated surface of the accretion disk .",
    "provided that the spectrum is sufficiently soft , x - rays can be absorbed at a small depth , forming a thin temperature - inversion layer but leaving most of the vertical structure of the disk undisturbed ( see tuchman , mineshige & wheeler 1990 ; wu 1999 ) .    the strong , double - peaked @xmath3 line seen during the high - soft state in 19961997",
    "was probably emitted via radiative recombination in this thin , hot layer , at temperatures @xmath116 k.    while the @xmath3 was detected throughout the 1996 outburst , balmer emission was seen only after the hard x - rays turned on .",
    "balmer lines are likely to be emitted at lower temperatures ( @xmath117 k ) .",
    "moreover , the h@xmath1 double - peaked profile is strongly asymmetric and phase - dependent (  5.1.2 ) , while the @xmath3 profile is approximately symmetric at _ all _ phases .",
    "for all these reasons we suggest that @xmath3 and the balmer lines were emitted from different regions : the balmer lines probably originated from a deeper , denser layer in the disk where matter was heated by harder x - ray photons .",
    "gro j1655@xmath040 was active in the radio and hard x - ray energy bands in 1994 august  september .",

    "it was weaker than the previous outburst , with a peak flux density of about 2 jy .",
    "the hard x - ray flux recorded by batse ( harmon 1995 ) was below the 0.7 photon @xmath89 s@xmath28 level during the period august 15 ",

    "a sharp rise in the x - ray flux occurred on september 5 , and the flux stayed at the 2 photon @xmath89 s@xmath28 level for about 10 days .",

    "the spectra show a broad , flat - topped line at about @xmath136  .",
    "it can not be attributed to [ ] @xmath137 both because the wavelengths are discrepant , and because we do not see any emission from [ ] @xmath138 , whose strength should be one - third of that of [ ] @xmath137 .",
    "( the only forbidden lines possibly detected in our spectra obtained between 1994 august 30 and september 4 are [ ] @xmath139 , blended with the much stronger blue wing of h@xmath1 , and [ ] @xmath140 ; see figures  [ n_narrow94 ] ) .",
    "we identify the line at about @xmath136   as @xmath141 .",
    "another strong low - ionization metal line detected in the spectrum is the blend @xmath142 .",
    "other broad emission lines detected from and are listed in table 3 .",
    "we do not include a weak emission line at @xmath143   in table 3 , as it was seen only on the first two nights ( ew @xmath144 ) ; its wavelength is consistent with that of an line .",
    "bowen emission lines were also observed , broader than in 1996 june , and with a radial velocity curve consistent with that of the primary rather than the secondary .",
    "the fwhms of the optical lines observed before 1994 september 6 span a large range of values , from @xmath145 to @xmath114 .",
    "the broadest lines are those seen in absorption at h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 .",
    "we notice that a broad absorption trough at h@xmath2 was also detected in the 1995 march outburst by bianchini ( 1997 ) , and during the 1996 may ",
    "june high - soft state .",
    "the physical interpretation of the broad balmer absorption lines is probably the same as discussed in  5.2.1 .",
    "henceforth , we will focus only on the emission lines .",
    "for the orbital parameters of gro  j1655@xmath040 , the projected rotational velocity of the outer rim of a thin , keplerian accretion disk , truncated at or slightly beyond its tidal radius , is @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , any lines with an fwhm @xmath147 can not come from a thin keplerian disk .",
    "we classify the emission lines observed before 1994 september 6 as `` broad '' and `` narrow '' ( table 3 ) , according to whether their fwhm was larger or smaller than the minimum value of fwhm expected for disk emission .",
    "the broad emission lines were usually flat - topped , while the narrow emission lines were either single - peaked or had a hint of a double - peaked profile but with very low velocity separation . in some cases",
    "the distinction is blurred , especially for the weak lines . however , in most situations the two kinds of line profiles can be discerned .",
    "we notice that both the ew and the fwhm of the narrow lines changed significantly from night to night , while ew and fwhm of the broad lines were more stable .",
    "our phenomenological classification of broad and narrow emission lines in gro j1655@xmath040 is similar to the classification of emission lines in agns .",
    "for example , a study of 123 high - luminosity agns ( wills 1993 ) has shown that the profile of the @xmath148 emission line consists of a `` broad '' base and a `` narrow '' core , which are emitted from distinct regions .",
    "the fwhm of the line is determined by the core / base ratio : when the core is dominant , the line will appear narrow and sharply peaked ; and when the base is dominant the line will be broad and flat - topped ( cf .",
    "fig .  2 in wills 1993 ) .",
    "the low - ionization metal lines from and detected in our spectra are examples of broad emission lines ; their fwhms are consistent with a disk origin . unlike the disk emission lines seen in 1996 june , their profiles were generally flat - topped rather than double - peaked .",
    "flat - topped lines can be emitted in a wind from the surface of the accretion disk .",
    "murray & chiang ( 1997 ) showed that if the lines have substantial optical depth ( @xmath149 ) , the contribution of the wind from the front and back sectors of the disk ( where the projected radial velocities are lower ) is enhanced relative to the contribution of the wind from the sides of the disk ( where the projected radial velocities are higher ) , thus smearing out the two peaks in the line profile .",
    "from the fact that we detected only low - ionization broad lines from , , and , we infer an ionization parameter @xmath150 in the line - emitting disk wind",
    ". the corresponding temperature would be @xmath151 ",
    "@xmath152 k if the gas was collisionally ionized ( hatchett , buff & mccray 1976 ) ; the temperature would be lower if the line - emitting gas was photoionized .",
    "the possibility of an outflow or disk wind suggested by the broad optical emission line profiles observed in the 1994 x - ray outburst was already discussed in hunstead ( 1997 ) , who compared the spectrum of gro j1655@xmath040 with the spectra of wn6 - 8 wolf - rayet stars . in spite of the similarities ,",
    "there are several differences between the two cases .",
    "firstly , high - ionization emission lines usually found in wr stars , e.g.  from and , were not observed , indicating a lower temperature for the outflow in gro  j1655@xmath040 .",
    "secondly , no forbidden [ ] lines were observed , implying a higher density .",
    "thirdly , the broad , flat - topped profiles are better explained by a disk - wind model rather than by a spherical outflow as in typical wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the narrow emission lines showed large night - to - night changes in their ews and line profiles .",
    "in particular , they showed transitions between narrow , single - peaked and slightly broader , double - peaked profiles over the time - span of our observations .",
    "we notice that @xmath3 line was generally broader and more clearly double - peaked than h@xmath1 ( figure  [ n_stack94 ] ; cf .",
    "also the double - peaked profile in the combined spectrum shown in figure  [ total94_hb1 ] ) ; its peak - to - peak velocity separation was however always @xmath153 .",
    "some lines ( most notably @xmath76 ) were probably emitted from both the broad- and the narrow - line regions , with the intensity ratio determined by the relative contribution of the two components , i.e.  as in the `` base '' vs `` core '' classification scheme suggested by wills ( 1993 ) in their study of agns .",
    "both the h@xmath1 and @xmath3 emission lines were , on average , asymmetric ; they were slightly blue - shifted with respect to the central line wavelength ( taking into account the systemic velocity ) . in the combined spectrum of all six nights ,",
    "the h@xmath1 line is blue - shifted by @xmath154 , the h@xmath2 line by @xmath155 , the narrow component of the @xmath76 line by @xmath156 , and the @xmath3 line by @xmath157 .",
    "we note that a similar phenomenon is often observed in the emission lines from quasars and in some cataclysmic variables , and can be attributed to the expansion of clouds or to a gas outflow , when the receding gas is occulted from our view .",
    "owing to the well - determined orbital parameters , the upper limit to the size of the accretion disk in gro j1655@xmath040 is reasonably well constrained .",
    "we have found that the velocities inferred from the narrow widths of the h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 and @xmath3 lines were significantly lower than the velocities expected from a keplerian disk contained in the roche lobe of the compact star .",
    "one might argue that the low fwhm of the narrow emission lines was due to their formation in a circumbinary disk ( artymowicz & lubow 1996 ) .",
    "if this were true , no significant velocity shifts from the center - of - mass systemic velocity should be seen over an orbital cycle .",
    "however , soria ( 1998 ) have measured the radial velocity shifts of the line wings at one - quarter of the maximum intensity above the continuum , and found a sinusoidal variation consistent with the one observed in 1996 june , which was interpreted as the modulation due to orbital motion of the compact star . moreover , the profiles of these lines changed substantially from night to night . in the case of h@xmath1 ,",
    "the line profile was single - peaked on four nights , but double - peaked on the other two , with a velocity separation larger than expected from a circumbinary disk .",
    "we can therefore rule out the possibility of emission from a circumbinary disk .",
    "we interpret the narrow lines , instead , as emission from a spheroidal or extended optically thin region high above the accretion disk ( at lower rotational velocity ) .",
    "we notice that some cataclysmic variables show narrow , often single - peaked balmer and emission lines , yielding rotational velocities much slower than keplerian .",
    "for example , there is strong evidence of an optically thin line - emitting region extended well above the disk plane in the eclipsing system pg 1012@xmath0029 ( honeycutt , schlegel & kaitchuck 1986 ) .",
    "the larger fwhm of the high - ionization line suggests that it was probably emitted closer to the disk plane than h@xmath1 , and/or at slightly smaller radii , where we expect the irradiation from the central source to be stronger .",
    "the night - to - night variability in the line profiles ( figure  [ n_stack94 ] ) might reflect changes in the line - of - sight opacity of the optically thin region .",
    "opacity variations can be caused by matter inhomogeneities ( i.e.  moving clouds ) in the line emission region or variable obscuration along the light path .",
    "furthermore , the variability between single - peaked and double - peaked profiles indicates that the extended line - emitting region was not in steady state ; for instance , the profiles would tend to become broader and more `` disk - like '' ( as those observed in 1996 june ) as the thin clouds dissipated , and less `` disk - like '' when the emission from the clouds was stronger .",
    "the presence of optically thin line - emitting gas well above the disk plane may be explained in various ways : some accreting matter might not yet have settled down onto the disk , after the end of the strong hard x - ray flare observed by batse in 1994 august .",
    "we shall argue in  6.4.2 that the outer disk is likely to be disrupted and puffed up into a thick torus during a hard x - ray flare .",
    "some of the gas in the extended narrow - line region may also have been the result of bipolar outflows from the disk surface , as suggested by the systematic blue - shift and by the detection of strong winds in the broad - line region .",
    "the extended , optically thin narrow - line - region model is valid only if the uv and soft x - ray flux is not too high .",
    "soft irradiating flux of order of the eddington limit at distances @xmath158 cm would yield an ionization parameter @xmath159 in the thin narrow - line region , for a gas with densities @xmath160 @xmath161 .",
    "this would imply temperatures @xmath162 k , difficult to reconcile with the presence of lines such as h@xmath1 .",
    "although no uv and soft x - ray data were obtained at that epoch , the fact that we detected only low - ionization metal lines ( for example from and ) implies that the soft flux could not have been too strong in the 1994 x - ray outburst .",
    "a sharp increase in the hard x - ray flux was detected by batse around september 5 ( harmon 1995 ) .",
    "the broad , and emission lines disappeared from the blue spectrum obtained on september 6 ( figure  [ 06sep ] ) , and @xmath3 and the bowen lines were much weaker than in the previous nights . h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 were instead much stronger : for h@xmath1 , ew @xmath163  , and for h@xmath2 , ew @xmath164  .",
    "the low - resolution of the red spectrum does not allow for a reliable determination of the fwhm of h@xmath1 ; for h@xmath2 , fwhm @xmath165 . the h@xmath1@xmath166h@xmath2 ew ratio increased by a factor of 4 between september 4 and september 6 .",
    "other lines clearly seen in emission are the paschen series of and several lines ( @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath76 , @xmath83 ) .",
    "all these emission lines were single - peaked ; unfortunately , the low s / n of the blue spectrum and the low resolution of the red spectrum do not permit an accurate determination of their strengths and widths .",
    "the sudden increase in the balmer emission between september 4 and september 6 coincided with the sharp increase in the hard x - ray flux .",
    "the ews ( in absolute value ) of h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 and @xmath3 are shown in figure  [ batse_ew94 ] compared with the hard x - ray flux measured by batse .",
    "the balmer ews and the hard x - ray flux appear well correlated , as in the 1996 june observations .",
    "such correlation is not seen for @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , its intensity dropped when the the hard x - ray flux rose .",
    "shrader ( 1996 ) also noticed the dramatic increase in the h@xmath1 emission and the disappearance of @xmath3 around tjd 9600 , after the hard x - ray flux surge ( see their fig .  1 ) .",
    "their low - resolution spectrum obtained on september 8 showed only emission from the low - ionization lines , and .",
    "optical spectra taken by bianchini ( 1997 ) on 1994 , august 12  15 , during the decline of an earlier hard x - ray flare , showed emission almost as strong as that in our september 6 spectrum from low - ionization lines like h@xmath1 ( mean ew @xmath170  ) and h@xmath2 ( mean ew @xmath171  ) .",
    "the h@xmath1@xmath166h@xmath2 ew ratio was 9.2 , a factor of 3 higher than on september 4 , and slightly lower than on september 6 .",
    "the high - ionization @xmath3 ( mean ew @xmath172  ) and @xmath15 ( mean ew @xmath173  ) lines were also present , showing disk or disk - wind signatures ( see fig .  2 in bianchini 1997 ) . from the peak separation and the width of the flat - topped profiles",
    ", we can infer that the outer - disk radius was @xmath174 cm .",
    "broad absorption troughs were not seen in those spectra .",
    "we suspect that the conditions on august 12  15 were intermediate between those we observed before and after september 5 . in the period of low x - ray activity between august 15 and september 5 , a geometrically thin accretion disk was probably re - forming and re - expanding to its tidal radius after having been disrupted in the previous hard x - ray flare , only to be then `` evaporated '' again into an extended atmosphere or cocoon by the following flare .",
    "as the photoionization cross - section for hydrogenic ions falls approximately as @xmath175 for photon energies larger than the threshold energy ( 13.6 ev for hydrogen ) ( see osterbrock 1989 ) , the hard ( @xmath176 kev ) x - ray photons contribute little to the ionization level of the gas , compared with the uv and soft x - ray photons .",
    "however , compton heating by the hard x - rays can alter the disk structure and drive a disk - wind ( e.g.  begelman , mckee & shields 1983 ; idan & shaviv 1996 ) . in the extreme conditions ,",
    "the dense disk - wind would create a cocoon surrounding the accretion disk ; in this situation one may consider the accretion disk being practically evaporated into a thick atmosphere .",
    "the absence of the characteristic broad absorption troughs at h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 and of broad disk - like emission lines in our september 6 spectrum suggests the absence of an exposed , geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk .",
    "an increase in the optical depth of the corona could have caused the increase in balmer line emission and the disappearance of the high - ionization lines .",
    "the higher h@xmath1@xmath166h@xmath2 ew ratio measured during the 1994 august and september hard x - ray flares , and the paschen emission lines observed on september 6 , indicate that the corona was optically thick in the balmer series .",
    "when this situation occurs , every h@xmath2 photon is resonantly absorbed by a nearby hydrogen atom in the @xmath177 state ; the process of emission and reabsorption is repeated until the h@xmath2 photon splits into h@xmath1 + p@xmath1 photons , which will both escape ( `` case c '' recombination , see e.g.  mccray 1996 ) .",
    "after the end of the 1994 august hard x - ray flare , the extended cocoon probably became optically thin to the balmer lines ( `` case b '' recombination ) , as observed on august 30  september 4 .",
    "the disk was `` puffed up '' again by the hard x - ray flare after september 4 , so that balmer lines were emitted via case c recombination .",
    "archival spectra obtained from the anglo - australian observatory , taken on september 27 ( figure  [ greenhill94 ] ) , show features almost identical to those observed on august 30  september 4 ( cf .",
    "figures  [ total94_ha ] and [ total94_hb1 ] ) , suggesting that the cocoon once again became optically thin after the end of the second hard x - ray flare .",
    "the simultaneous decrease in the observed strength of the and bowen lines at the time of the hard x - ray increase can perhaps be attributed to a geometric effects . as gro  j1655@xmath040 has a high orbital inclination , a thick outer - disk rim , inflated by hard x - ray irradiation , may occult the inner region where the high - ionization lines are formed , and explain their weakness in the september 6 spectrum .",
    "finally , we note that a major episode of plasma ejection occurred on 1994 september 9 , inferred from the radio observations ( harmon 1995 ; see also wu & hunstead 1997 ) , a few days after the change in the optical and hard x - ray spectra .",
    "it was suggested ( fabian & rees 1995 ) that there may be a connection between the production of collimated jets and the presence of an extended hot , high pressure atmosphere and a quasi - spherical accretion flow in the centers of elliptical galaxies , the usual hosts for radio - loud emission . whether the same mechanism was a catalyst for the collimated ejections observed in the radio - loud outburst of gro j1655@xmath040 in 1994 august ",
    "september is an issue worth investigating .",
    "we have obtained optical spectra of the soft x - ray transient gro  j1655@xmath040 during different energy states ( quiescence , high - soft and hard outburst ) between 1994 august and 1997 june .",
    "spectra taken one day after the observed brightening in @xmath41 in 1996 april did not at that stage show evidence of emission lines from an accretion disk .",
    "the main spectral features were narrow absorption lines from the secondary star .",
    "the optical brightening was probably due to an increase in the continuum emission from the disk ; emission lines could not be formed at that stage , in the absence of x - ray irradiation .    for the 1996  97 high - soft state , we have identified characteristic features such as broad absorption lines at h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 , partly filled by double - peaked emission lines .",
    "we argue that the broad absorption was formed in the hot inner disk , and the double - peaked @xmath3 emission originated in a temperature - inversion layer on the disk surface , created by the soft x - ray irradiation .",
    "the observed rotational velocities suggest that the disk was probably extended beyond its tidal radius .",
    "we have also found that the double - peaked h@xmath1 emission was associated with the hard x - ray flux , suggesting that it was probably emitted at comparable radii but from deeper layers ( at higher optical depth ) than @xmath3 .",
    "we note that the balmer lines were not emitted uniformly from the whole disk surface , but appeared to come only from a double - armed region , possibly the effect of tidal density waves or shocks on the disk .",
    "we have identified three classes of lines in the spectra taken in 1994 august ",
    "september before the onset of a hard x - ray flare : broad absorption , broad ( flat - topped ) emission and narrow emission .",
    "the narrow emission line profiles can not be explained by a conventional thin accretion disk model .",
    "we speculate that the system was in a transient state in which the accretion disk had an extended , optically thin cocoon and significant matter outflow , which would also help to explain the systematic blue - shift of the narrow emission lines and the flat - topped profiles of the broad emission lines .",
    "after the onset of a hard x - ray flare , the disk signatures disappeared , and strong h@xmath1 and paschen emission was detected , suggesting that the cocoon became optically thick to the balmer lines .",
    "high - ionization lines disappeared or weakened .",
    "two weeks after the end of the flare , the cocoon appeared to be once again optically thin .",

    "<S> =    we have obtained optical spectra of the soft x - ray transient gro j1655@xmath040 during different x - ray spectral states ( quiescence , high - soft and hard outburst ) between 1994 august and 1997 june . </S>",
    "<S> characteristic features observed during the 199697 high - soft state were : a ) broad absorption lines at h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 , probably formed in the inner disk ; b ) double - peaked @xmath3 emission lines , formed in a temperature - inversion layer on the disk surface , created by the soft x - ray irradiation ; c ) double - peaked h@xmath1 emission , with a strength associated with the hard x - ray flux , suggesting that it was probably emitted from deeper layers than @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 line profile appeared approximately symmetric , as we would expect from a disk surface with an axisymmetric emissivity function . </S>",
    "<S> the balmer emission , on the other hand , appeared to come only from a double - armed region on the disk , possibly the locations of tidal density waves or spiral shocks . </S>",
    "<S> the observed rotational velocities of all the double - peaked lines suggest that the disk was extended slightly beyond its tidal radius .    </S>",
    "<S> three classes of lines were identified in the spectra taken in 1994 august  </S>",
    "<S> september , during a period of low x - ray activity between two strong x - ray flares : broad absorption , broad ( flat - topped ) emission and narrow emission . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the narrow ( single - peaked or double - peaked ) emission lines can not be explained by a conventional thin accretion disk model . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the system was in a transient state , in which the accretion disk might have had an extended optically thin cocoon and significant matter outflow , which would also explain the systematic blue - shift of the narrow emission lines and the flat - topped profiles of the broad emission lines .    </S>",
    "<S> after the onset of a hard x - ray flare the disk signatures disappeared , and strong single - peaked h@xmath1 and paschen emission was detected , suggesting that the cocoon became opaque to optical radiation . </S>",
    "<S> high - ionization lines disappeared or weakened . </S>",
    "<S> two weeks after the end of the flare , the cocoon appeared to be once again optically thin . </S>"
