    "in particular , necessary and sufficient conditions were found for ( [ jordankdv ] ) to possess higher symmetries and conservation laws , these being best expressed in terms of the algebra defined by the constants @xmath6    let @xmath7 be a finite dimensional commutative algebra over @xmath8 with basis @xmath9 with multiplication @xmath10 the algebra is said to be a jordan algebra if @xmath11 for all @xmath12 this is a cubic conditions on the structure constants @xmath13 note that if the algebra is associative then it is automatically a jordan algebra",
    ". in what follows it will be useful to introduce the so - called associator @xmath14 defined by @xmath15 or , in components , by @xmath16 this is a measure of the deviation of the jordan algebra from being associative . with this the jordan condition",
    "may be written succinctly as @xmath17 more details of jordan algebras may be found in @xcite and in @xcite . in this paper",
    "two additional conditions will be assumed . for simple , irreducible , jordan algebras these hold automatically .    *",
    "the algebra has a unity element @xmath18 such that @xmath19 this condition is very weak , since any algebra without a unity element may be appended with a unity element @xcite ; * let @xmath20 denote the operation of multiplication by the element @xmath3 in @xmath21 with this one may define a canonical bilinear symmetric form @xmath22 in local coordinates this will be denoted @xmath23 so @xmath24 the assumption that will be made is that this bilinear form is non - degenerate and that is satisfies the frobenius condition @xmath25    with these conditions the systems ( [ jordankdv ] ) possesses an infinite series of non - trivial canonical conservation laws as well as higher symmetries and a recursion operator @xcite .",
    "hence it may be regarded as an integrable system .    in purpose of this paper",
    "is to study the dispersionless limit of these systems , namely @xmath26 these systems are examples of equations of hydrodynamic type , that is , they are of the form @xmath27 in particular the conservation laws and bi - hamiltonian structures for these systems will be studied .",
    "the system ( [ djordankdv ] ) may be rewritten in terms of an @xmath7-valued function @xmath28 as @xmath29 the main , and historically the first , examples of jordan algebras came from matrix multiplication , here denoted @xmath30 via @xmath31 such jordan algebras are said to be special , though it is important to note that not all jordan algebras arise in this way . for such systems ( [ fvalued ] ) simplifies further to @xmath32 this equation has appeared in the literature before @xcite and may be thought of as a matrix hopf equation .",
    "the simplest example , where @xmath33 is a @xmath34 symmetric matrix corresponds to the @xmath35-jordan algebra constructed below .",
    "such a matrix equations are integrable , in the sense that they arise as the compatibility conditions for the lax pair @xmath36 \\phi   =   0 \\ , , \\\\[1ex ] \\left[\\partial_t - \\lambda \\,{\\cal u}^2\\right ] \\phi   =   0\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and so can be integrated by the inverse scattering transform .    under certain natural assumptions it may be shown that equation ( [ djordankdv ] ) has an infinite hierarchy of hydrodynamic conservation laws if and only if the corresponding algebra is jordan @xcite .",
    "the resultant systems are thus the dispersionless limits of the integrable , dispersive , systems ( [ jordankdv ] ) introduced by svinolupov @xcite .",
    "condition ( [ conditiona ] ) may be written in local coordinates as @xmath37 using @xmath38 and @xmath39 to lower and raise indices , this condition , together with the commutativity of the jordan multiplication , implies that @xmath40 is totally symmetric .",
    "this in turn implies the existence of a scalar function @xmath41 which will be called the prepotential , such that @xmath42 there being no integrability conditions since @xmath43 are constants .",
    "this prepotential is defined only up to quadratic terms , and satisfies the normalization condition @xmath44 this follows from the existence of the unity element in the algebra ( so @xmath45 ) and definition ( [ defeta ] ) .",
    "these conditions bear a striking resemblance to the definition of a frobenius manifold @xcite , and in the case where the jordan multiplication is actually associative , they are identical .",
    "thus one is lead to the definition of a jordan manifold .",
    "* definition*. let @xmath46 be a scalar function such that the third derivatives @xmath47 satisfy the following conditions :    * [ normalization ] @xmath48 is a constant non - degenerate matrix .",
    "this , together with its inverse , may be used to lower and raise indices , and hence may be regarded as a ( flat ) metric on the manifold ; * [ jordan condition ] the structure constants @xmath49 define a jordan algebra @xmath50 on each tangent space of the manifold .",
    "the unity vector field @xmath51 will be denoted by @xmath52    it is not known whether there are non - trivial , i.e. non - cubic , examples of the function @xmath41 the jordan condition , a system of third order , third degree , partial differential equations , being far more rigid than the wdvv - equations of associativity .",
    "for the purposes of this paper the @xmath53 must be constant , so @xmath54 must be a cubic function ( ignoring quadratic terms which do not effect these constants ) .",
    "thus @xmath54 must be a homogeneous function , and hence one may add an extra condition to the above definition :    * [ homogeneity ] the prepotential @xmath54 must be a homogeneous function , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the lie - derivative along the euler vector field @xmath57    there is considerable scope for investigating jordan manifolds in more generality than will be needed here , where only cubic @xmath54 s will be considered .",
    "* example*. in two dimensions there are , up to isomorphism , five jordan algebras @xcite .",
    "the only one to have a unity element is also associative , corresponding to the case @xmath58 in the example below .",
    "* example*. let @xmath59 the resulting algebra is associative , describing classical , rather than quantum , cohomology .",
    "the resulting dispersionless kdv system is : @xmath60 where all the upper diagonal entries are zero .",
    "* example*. ( the @xmath61-jordan algebras @xcite ) let the jordan product on @xmath62 be defined by @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the ordinary inner product with @xmath66 without loss of generality , one may take @xmath67 and hence obtain the multiplication table @xmath68 ( such a multiplication comes from an underlying clifford multiplication ) .",
    "the structure constants may be written compactly as @xmath69 the inner product is given by ( on ignoring an overall factor of @xmath0 ) @xmath70 and the prepotential @xmath54 is @xmath71 the corresponding dispersionless kdv system may easily be written down ; for @xmath72 this being : @xmath73 this is the only irreducible jordan algebra in dimension 3 .",
    "* example*. a canonical class of jordan algebras are defined by the multiplication @xmath74 where @xmath3 and @xmath75 are matrices and @xmath30 is matrix multiplication . consider the ( irreducible ) algebra of symmetric @xmath76 matrices with elements in @xmath77 taking as a basis @xmath78 one may drive the structure constants of the jordan algebra and hence the inner product .",
    "the resulting prepotential is @xmath79\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath80 for notational convenience .",
    "the metric is not diagonal in the basis .",
    "it may , of course , be diagonalized , but this will change the simple form of the above matrix - basis .",
    "equation ( [ djordankdv ] ) may be written in hamiltonian form @xmath81 the hamiltonian densities form an infinite series of conservation laws , which generate an infinite family of commuting flows .",
    "these densities will be labelled by their degree , the first two being @xmath82 these define commuting flows ( defined so @xmath83 may be identified with @xmath3 ) @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the operator @xmath86 the existence of a unity element in the algebra implies that these densities are connected by the relation @xmath87    any hydrodynamic conservation law @xmath88_t = { \\rm flux } [ { \\bf u } ] _ x\\ ] ] may be expanded , using ( [ djordankdv ] ) , yielding @xmath89 the integrability condition for this is @xmath90 by differentiating this with respect to @xmath91 the unity element , one finds that @xmath92 satisfies the same equation , and hence is also conserved .",
    "these conserved densities are all homogeneous and may be labelled by their degree , so by euler s theorem @xmath93 they may also be normalised so that @xmath94 the basic relation ( [ conservationlaw ] ) may also be used to derive a recursion relation amongst the densities .",
    "let @xmath95 in ( [ conservationlaw ] ) , so , on using the unity relation , ( [ euler ] ) and ( [ recursiondown ] ) @xmath96 multiplying by @xmath97 and using euler s theorem ( [ euler ] ) again yields @xmath98 alternatively , from ( [ usefulequation ] ) and euler s theorem one may derive @xmath99 u^j = 0\\,.\\ ] ] the term in square brackets will not , in general , be zero , but for frobenius manifolds it does vanish , while in the examples below it does not .",
    "thus one has the following recursion scheme for these hamiltonian densities : @xmath100    * example*. the matrix hopf equation    the matrix hopf equation ( [ matrixhopf ] ) is known to have the conservation laws @xmath101 where @xmath102 since @xmath18 is just the identity matrix .",
    "these coincide with the conservation laws previously constructed , for example    @xmath103    to show that that these traces ( [ recursiondown ] ) is straightforward : @xmath104 and to show that they satisfy ( [ usefulequation])(and hence ( [ recursion ] ) by homogeneity ) is similar : @xmath105\\ ] ] so @xmath106\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{(n-1 ) ! } tr\\left [ a^i_{jk } u^j e_i { \\cal u}^{n-1 } \\right]\\\\ & =   \\frac{1}{(n-1 ) ! } tr\\left [ { \\cal u } \\frac{\\partial{\\cal u}}{\\partial u^k } { \\cal u}^{n-1}\\right]\\\\ & =   n \\frac{\\partial h^{(n+1)}}{\\partial u^k}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence these trace formulae for conserved quantities satisfy the general results ( [ recursiondown ] ) and ( [ recursion ] ) .",
    "* example*. ( the @xmath35-jordan algebra )    the first few conserved densities are : @xmath107 the general terms may easily by derived : @xmath108 } ( -1)^r \\left(\\begin{array}{c } n \\\\",
    "2r \\end{array}\\right ) ( v^2+w^2)^r \\,u^{(n-2r)}\\,.\\ ] ] these may be amalgamated into a generating function , the coefficients of @xmath109 in the power series expansion being the conserved densities , @xmath110 similiarly there is a second family of conservation laws given by the generating function @xmath111 these may be combined as @xmath112 the significance of the functions @xmath113 will be explained in the next section .",
    "this first hamiltonian structure may also , trivially , be obtained by taking the dispersionless limit of the first hamiltonian structure of the dispersive system ( [ jordankdv ] ) .",
    "it turns out that this procedure fails when applied to the second hamiltonian structure .",
    "svinolupov @xcite ( see also @xcite ) found the recursion operator for ( [ jordankdv ] ) : @xmath114 applying this to the first hamiltonian operator will be used for dispersive hamiltonian operators , and @xmath115 for the dispersionless limits of these operators . ]",
    "@xmath116 gives the second , compatible , hamiltonian operator @xmath117 note that @xmath118 for @xmath119 to be a hamiltonian operator requires that the structure constants @xmath120 define a jordan algebra : up to now this property has not been used .    to perform the scaling @xmath121 ( under which the euler operator @xmath122 is invariant )",
    "one must expand an arbitrary hamiltonian density as a power series in @xmath123 @xmath124 + \\epsilon^2 \\delta h^{(n ) } [ { \\bf u},{\\bf u_x},{\\bf u_{xx}}]+ o(\\epsilon^4)\\,.\\ ] ] so @xmath125 is purely hydrodynamic , @xmath126 etc .. thus the dispersive system @xmath127 transforms to @xmath128 there is a potential singular term , @xmath129 but it may be shown that this vanishes when @xmath125 is a conserved density .",
    "the form of this suggests one should define a metric and a connection by the formulae @xmath130 in terms of the jordan manifold structure the metric may be written invariantly as @xmath131 here the metric @xmath132 has been used to induce a multiplication , also denoted by @xmath133 dual to ( [ tangentmult ] ) on each cotangent space of the manifold .",
    "this metric has the property , derived from the existence of a unity in the jordan algebra , that @xmath134 these formulae define a metric connection , since @xmath135 however the metric has torsion , the torsion tensor being the anti - symmetric part of the connection @xmath136 this is related to the failure of the algebra defined by @xmath120 to be associative and @xmath137 will always raises and lowered using @xmath132 and its inverse , not by @xmath138 and its inverse . ] : @xmath139 similarly , the curvature also depends on the associator .",
    "thus in the case where the algebra is associative , where one has a frobenius manifold , these structures reduces to a flat , torsion free metric connection , as required by the dubrovin - novikov theorem @xcite .",
    "because of the presence of torsion @xmath140 in general",
    ". however , using the recursion relation ( [ recursion ] ) one may show that @xmath141 this result is behind the vanishing of the potentially singular terms in ( [ secondham ] ) .",
    "the presence of the second , non - local term in ( [ secondham ] ) is an unusual feature .",
    "it is non - local , but acts on @xmath142 which is quadratic in derivatives .",
    "these two effects conspire to produce a purely hydrodynamic flow",
    ". it may be shown , using ideas developed for studying genus - one deformations in topological field theory @xcite , that the @xmath143 satisfy the recursion relation @xcite @xmath144 with initial condition @xmath145 thus @xmath146 is a function of @xmath147 alone , and hence , by recursion , @xmath143 is a complicated function of the densities @xmath148 and their derivatives .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for a hydrodynamic system ( [ genhydro ] ) to be put into riemann invariant form @xmath149 r^i_x\\ ] ] is the vanishing of the haantjes tensor @xcite .",
    "this is defined in terms of the nijenhuis tensor @xmath150 by @xmath151 if this vanishes then the hydrodynamic system is integrable by the generalized hodograph transform @xcite .    for the dispersionless kdv system",
    "the nijenhuis tensor is linear ; @xmath152 so for any system related to a frobenius manifold , for which the associator vanishes , the haantjes tensor vanishes trivially .",
    "this reproduces a special case of the result that the hydrodynamic systems obtained from frobenius manifolds are integrable by the generalized hodograph transformation .",
    "the vanishing of the haantjes tensor is a quartic condition on the structure constants .",
    "jordan algebras may , or may not , have vanishing haantjes tensor .    *",
    "example*. for the jordan algebra constructed in section 2 for @xmath76 matrices , the corresponding haantjes tensor is non - zero .",
    "this may be shown by direct computation .",
    "* example*. for the @xmath61-jordan algebras the corresponding haantjes tensor vanishes . using the representation of the structure constants ( [ dnconstants ] )",
    "one may show @xmath153 ( in general , if the jordan algebra has a unity then @xmath154 if any @xmath155 ) tedious but straightforward calculations then show that the haantjes tensor vanishes .",
    "thus the @xmath61-jordan algebra dispersionless kdv equations may be written in riemann invariant form .",
    "* example*. ( @xmath35-jordan algebra )    in terms of the riemann invariants @xmath156 the system ( [ basicexample ] ) becomes ( to ensure a hyperbolic system the transformations @xmath157 have been made ) : @xmath158 this shows a certain degree of degeneracy : the first two equation are completely decoupled , and the third is linear .",
    "this does not contradict svinolupov s result on the irreducibility of the corresponding kdv system , only linear transformation are allowed for kdv systems  nonlinear ones destroying the form of the equations , while for dispersionless systems nonlinear transformation preserve the form of a hydrodynamic system .",
    "furthermore , the conservation laws constructed earlier are independent of @xmath159 in fact they too decouple : @xmath160 more generally any function @xmath161 is a conserved density for this system .",
    "the jordan kdv equations have all the properties one would expect from a completely integrable system  even though lax equations for them have not been found in all cases .",
    "this paper is a first attempt to study the dispersionless limits of these systems .",
    "the obvious question is whether ( and in what sense ) the systems remain integrable in this limit . for any @xmath162-component hamiltonian system of hydrodynamic",
    "type one has the following result :    * theorem*. @xcite    a @xmath162-component hamiltonian system is integrable if and only if one of the following conditions are fulfilled :    * the system is diagonalizable ( and hence integrable by the generalized hodograph transform ) ; * the system is non - diagonalizable , but weakly non - linear ( and hence integrable by the inverse scattering transform ) .    for systems with more components",
    "there are no analogues to this theorem , though certain conjectures have been made @xcite . for certain systems , such as the @xmath35-jordan system ,",
    "the system is semi - hamiltonian and hence integrable by the generalized hodograph transform .",
    "however not all systems are semi - hamiltonian , or even have maximal numbers of riemann invariants , and for such systems the precise nature of their integrability remains unclear .",
    "properties of conserved densities and the first hamiltonian structure of these systems remain unchanged under this limit .",
    "the existence of the unity element in the jordan algebra , one of the additional assumptions made in this paper , enables conserved densities to be defined recursively . however , direct averaging of the second hamiltonian structure is problematic .",
    "one obtains a non - local operator which depends both on @xmath125 and @xmath163 so there remains a vestige of the original dispersive system .",
    "the term @xmath142 may , via ( [ firstorderrecursion ] ) , be calculated in terms of @xmath164 so in an implicit way the second structure @xmath165 is a function of the purely hydrodynamic part of the dispersive hamiltonian density .",
    "all these problems disappear if the algebra is associative , where one reproduces standard results from the theory of frobenius manifolds .",
    "there are many interesting systems which fall outside , though are closely related to , the class considered here .",
    "probably the simplest is the dispersionless limit of ito s system @xcite , which falls into a class of equations of kdv - type associated to any lie algebra @xcite : @xmath166 this is of the general form ( [ djordankdv ] ) , though the algebra defined by the structure constants is not a jordan algebra .",
    "this system is bi - hamiltonian with operators @xmath167 and in this case these are the dispersionless limits of the corresponding dispersive operators @xcite .",
    "the dispersive counterpart is of the general form @xmath168 where @xmath169 is a degenerate , constant , matrix .",
    "clearly further work is required to understand the properties of compatible hamiltonian structures under the dispersionless limit , both for the jordan systems @xcite and for the lie - algebra systems @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to use the hydrodynamic non - local hamiltonian operators , as developed by ferapontov ( see appendix ) .",
    "this has the advantage of being comparatively simple to apply to a specific system , though in moving to riemann invariant form ( if such a form exists ) the connection with jordan algebras is lost and so it seems hard to develop a general theory of dispersionless kdv equations along these lines .",
    "the example of the @xmath35-jordan system shows that the resulting structures may be somewhat degenerate ; two of the equations decouple and the third is linear .",
    "for @xmath170 the @xmath61-jordan systems have repeated eigenvalues ( or characteristic velocities ) . the appearance of repeated characteristic velocities , where @xmath171=v^j[{\\bf r}]$ ] for certain @xmath172 makes finding the metric more problematical , though not impossible . other examples with such repeated characteristic velocities ,",
    "also related to jordan algebras , have been studied in @xcite .",
    "i would like to thank oscar mccarthy for numerous discussions on the topic of jordan kdv systems .",
    "in this appendix we restrict our attention to the system ( [ rd3 ] ) . the hamiltonian structure for this will involve non - local tails , that is , be of the form @xmath173 the conditions for this to be hamiltonian being given in @xcite .",
    "the system ( [ rd3 ] ) is semi - hamiltonian , the characteristic speeds satisfying the system @xmath174 the hamiltonian structure is given in terms of a diagonal metric @xmath175 where the components are defined by the equation @xmath176 the semi - hamiltonian condition being the integrability condition for this system . for the @xmath35-dispersionless jordan system",
    "this metric is @xmath177 where @xmath178 are arbitrary functions of their arguments .",
    "commuting flows are given by @xmath179 r^i_x\\,,$ ] where the functions @xmath180 solve the system @xmath181 for this system the solutions are easily obtained : @xmath182 r^3_x\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] note that for this system the commuting flows are labeled by three arbitrary functions @xmath183 rather than a discrete label .",
    "this is already manifest in the dispersionless kdv equation , where the flows @xmath184 commute for all functions @xmath185 , not just for the functions @xmath186 which correspond to the dispersionless limits of the full kdv hierarchy .    the functional dependence in the weingarten operators @xmath187 is now fixed by requiring that the components @xmath188 satisfy the equation @xmath189 here @xmath190 labels the functional dependence in weingarten operators .",
    "this expansion fixes these in terms of the arbitrary functions in the metric .",
    "thus to each set of functions @xmath191 one obtains a non - local hamiltonian operator .",
    "these are all mutually compatible , resulting in a multi - hamiltonian structures .",
    "the full details of the multi - hamiltonian structure of the @xmath61-dispersionless jordan systems may be found in @xcite ."
