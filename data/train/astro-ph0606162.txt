    "about 1020% of quasars show broad absorption lines ( bal ) , especially in their ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra .",
    "these absorption features usually extend to velocities as high as @xmath0@xmath1  relative to the emission lines , indicating high - velocity outflows in the quasars .",
    "these absorbers have been identified with winds blowing from an obscuring torus or arising from smaller scales associated with an accretion disk feeding a super massive black hole .",
    "the popular orientation model suggests that bal quasars are normal quasars viewed along the specific line of sight , or particularly edge - on , skimming the torus or through a wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although in this picture , quasar radio properties and bals would seem to be independent , no radio - loud bal quasars were found for a long time .",
    "it remained so until deep radio surveys like the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , * ? ? ? * ) and first bright quasar survey ( fbqs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were conducted , surveying large areas to mjy levels , and radio - loud bal quasars started to be identified @xcite . still , bal quasar frequency does drop significantly among the most radio - loud quasars @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied 27 bal quasars from the fbqs sample and found that they show a wide range of radio spectral indices , from flat to steep , indicating that a range of orientations is present and therefore strongly challenging the orientation model .",
    "so far , only a few radio - loud bal quasars have been studied at x - ray energies ( brotherton et al .",
    "first  j101614.3 + 520916  ( hereafter j1016 + 5209 ) is the first confirmed bal quasar that has also been identified as radio - loud fanaroff - riley type ii ( fr  ii ) source @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fg : spec ] shows the bals in a rest - frame uv spectrum of j1016 + 5209  and table  [ tb : para ] provides its optical and radio parameters .",
    "the radio luminosity places it among the extreme end of radio - loud bal quasars .",
    "its double - lobed radio morphology and luminosity indicate a classic fr  ii radio source .",
    "@xcite argue that j1016 + 5209  is a rejuvenated quasar , possibly through a merger or interaction .",
    "we note that another known radio - loud , fr  ii bal quasar is lbqs",
    "1138 - 0126 @xcite , and that the double radio lobed bal quasar candidate pks  1004 + 13 @xcite has recently been confirmed by _",
    "_ observation @xcite as a bone fide fr  ii bal quasar .",
    "the other known radio - loud bal quasars have compact structures @xcite .",
    "observations with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory and _ xmm - newton _  show that bal quasars are up to 2 orders of magnitude fainter in x - rays than non - bal quasars of the same optical brightness @xcite .",
    "available x - ray spectral analyses of radio - quiet bal quasars show that they appear to have normal radio - quiet x - ray photon indices ( @xmath2 ) , partially or totally covered by absorbing columns of @xmath3@xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although the @xmath5 derived from uv absorption lines can not account for the absorption in the x - ray , the uv and x - ray absorbers are probably closely related @xcite .",
    "radio - loud quasars are factors of 23 times brighter in the x - rays than radio - quiet quasars with the same optical magnitude @xcite , and tend to have harder x - ray spectra ( @xmath6 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these factors may make them particularly suitable for initial exploratory studies of the intrinsic x - ray properties and the properties of the line - of - sight absorbers @xcite .",
    "we report the results of a short xmm - newton observation of j1016 + 5209  in this paper .",
    "we detect the object with enough counts to compute a hardness ratio , but not enough for more detailed spectral analysis .",
    "still , the detection can rule out some simple models and has shown us that even the most powerful radio - loud bal quasars are weak in x - rays .",
    "we observed first j1016 + 5209 with _ xmm - newton _  on november 3 , 2001 with a duration of @xmath7 10 ks .",
    "this was the first x - ray observation of an fr ii bal quasar .",
    "unfortunately high x - ray background flares limited the usable data of the detectors to only 6.1 ks from the epic mos 1 detector , 5.8 ks from the epic mos 2 detector ( fig .",
    "[ fg : xmm ] ) , and nothing from the more sensitive epic - pn detector .",
    "table  [ tb : xray ] gives the x - ray properties of first j1016 + 5209 .",
    "all of the counts have been background subtracted .",
    "we define the soft x - ray band to be 0.22 kev , and the hard x - ray band to be 28 kev .",
    "the hardness ratio is then determined to be hr = ( h@xmath8s)/(h+s ) = @xmath9 , where h and s are the source counts in the hard and soft bands , respectively , with errors following @xcite . assuming only galactic absorption , we used pimms to estimate that a photon index of 1.76 would give the measured hardness ratio seen in the mos detectors .",
    "there were too few counts ( 46 ) for a detailed spectral analysis , but the hardness ratio indicates an excess of soft photons over hard photons .",
    "the 0.28 kev flux after galactic absorption correction , @xmath1010@xmath11@xmath12  @xmath4 , is calculated using pimms and assuming the average power - law photon index @xmath13 for radio - loud quasars , consistent with our measured hr and @xcite .",
    "we also estimate the rest - frame optical - x - ray spectral index , @xmath14=@xmath15 , using an optical flux at rest - frame 2500 , and an unabsorbed rest - frame 2@xmath16  flux ( 0.579 kev in the observed frame ) .",
    "the unabsorbed rest - frame 2@xmath16  flux was calculated using the observed count rate , pimms and the galactic absorption , @xmath17 = 1.7 , and making a k - correction .",
    "cosmological effects in the conversion between fluxes in observed frame and rest frame have been taken into account .",
    "while @xmath14=@xmath15 would indicate a rather x - ray bright bal quasar , two additional facts should be considered in evaluating the intrinsic x - ray brightness of j1016 + 5209 : the optical flux appears significantly reddened and the x - ray brightness may also be estimated based on the radio flux .",
    "we estimate the intrinsic x - ray flux of j1016 + 5209  using the radio - x - ray correlation @xcite considering the 3@xmath18 uncertainty about the correlation very much , because @xmath14 spans a large frequency range and an uncertainty of a factor of 2 in x - ray flux only changes @xmath14 by 0.12 . ] .",
    "we used the total 5 ghz flux from gregg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and the relationship shown in figure 13 of brinkmann et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for radio - loud quasars .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray flux is estimated to be 17 ( @xmath19 ) times larger than the observed flux in the rosat bandpass .",
    "based on this apparent supression and an optical flux dereddened for intrinsic reddening ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we calculate an intrinsic optical - x - ray spectral index , @xmath20 . at 2 kev and @xmath21 , a neutral hi column density of n@xmath22 = @xmath23 @xmath4 would be required to account for the faintness of the observed x - ray flux .",
    "however , such a high hi column density would result in an extreme hardness ratio , close to unity , inconsistent with our observed hr=@xmath24 , which is only consistent for a column density of n@xmath22 @xmath25 @xmath2610@xmath27@xmath4 or less ( assuming a normal radio - loud quasar x - ray slope ) .",
    "in other words , most of the observed soft x - ray photons would have been absorbed if x - ray source in j1016 + 5209  is fully covered by such a high column density absorber .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the absorber for j1016 + 5209  is not a simple neutral absorber with a high column density",
    ". this conclusion should be be tempered by the significant uncertainties in these estimates , but is consistent with what is seen in other bal quasars .",
    "as mentioned above , the apparently low x - ray flux and the fact that the spectrum is not excessively hard together suggest that a fully covering neutral absorber with high column density can not explain our data .",
    "possible alternative scenarios for our observed x - rays include a partially covering neutral absorber , reflection by an ionized mirror , an ionized absorber , or jet contributions .",
    "a partially covering neutral absorber with very high column density would leave the observed x - ray spectrum similar to the incident spectrum except for suppressed x - ray flux .",
    "if our estimate of the intrinsic x - ray flux is correct , the covering factor derived from the x - ray reduction factor of 17 for j1016 + 5209  would be 94% .    an x - ray spectrum dominated by reflection off an ionized `` mirror ''",
    "@xcite could also explain our data , depending on the ionization state of the mirror . in this scenario ,",
    "at some ionization parameters , fe k@xmath28 emission would present in the x - ray spectrum , but would require better x - ray observations to be detected .",
    "ionized absorbers have also often been invoked to explain the x - ray observations of active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since these absorbers can also be transparent for soft x - ray photons , but our data set has too few counts to identify any possible absorption edges in order to test this explanation .",
    "due to the radio - loud nature and the lobe - dominated morphology of this object , it is also possible that at least part of the observed x - ray is from the jets .",
    "recent high - resolution x - ray observations have made it possible to systematically study x - ray jets and lobes @xcite .",
    "the detection rate is typically @xmath2960% @xcite .",
    "we therefore speculate that x - rays from the accretion disk could be completely absorbed , and we are detecting intrinsically weaker but unabsorbed x - rays from the jets , even if beaming effects are not be large given that j1016 + 5209  has a steep radio spectrum .",
    "the average photon index of the jets is @xmath291.5 for a sample of mostly fr  ii objects @xcite , and the core - to - jet x - ray flux ratio has a wide range for the detections in another sample @xcite , from 5 to about 200 .",
    "this range covers the supression factor of this object ( 17 ) and most of those radio - loud bal quasars ( 42 - 348 ) in @xcite , which have x - ray fluxes consistent with what might be expected arising solely in the jets .",
    "again , better data are required to test this explanation .",
    "finally , there is a possibility that j1016 + 5209  is intrinsically x - ray faint , or in a low state at the time of the observation since some bal quasars do show significant variability ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . unfortunately our short , high background observation constitutes more of a detection rather than a light curve , preventing us from detecting variability .",
    "however , all bal quasars so far observed with enough counts for spectral analysis @xcite indicate that x - ray absorption is more likely the primary cause of the `` x - ray weak '' quasars @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported x - ray detections of 5 radio - loud core - dominated bal quasars with chandra .",
    "the hardness ratio ranges from @xmath80.7 to 0.1 , and @xmath14 from @xmath80.8 to @xmath82.0 .",
    "all 5 objects also show significant x - ray suppression compared to estimates of their intrinsic x - ray flux . compared with this sample , j1016 +",
    "5209  does not seem to be abnormal in @xmath14 or hardness ratio ; our xmm hardness ratio from table 2 ( hr = @xmath24 ) is equivalent to a chandra hr = @xmath80.7 ( estimated using pimms , set to cxo3 ) .",
    "the x - ray properties of these radio - loud bal quasars are in general agreement with the results for radio - quiet bal quasars . based on their x - ray spectral analyses",
    ", @xcite suggested that radio - quiet bal quasars have typical intrinsic power - law x - ray continuum of normal radio - quiet quasars , but with significant absorption column density .",
    "however , they argue that the absorption is likely very complicated and it is not typically possible to distinguish between a partially covering and an ionized absorber with their data .",
    "@xcite showed excess soft x - ray photons in their spectra of 2 radio - quiet bal quasars , and also reported that both a partially covering absorber and an ionized absorber could fit their observed spectra .",
    "it is still not clear whether radio - loud bal quasars also have the typical intrinsic x - ray continuum of normal radio - loud quasars or whether the fr  ii type bal quasars like j1016 + 5209   have special x - ray properties .",
    "high - quality x - ray spectra are needed to answer these questions and to reveal the real x - ray nature of j1016 + 5209   and other radio - loud bal quasars .",
    "we have observed and detected the first confirmed radio - loud fr  ii bal quasar first j1016 + 5209 in the x - ray with xmm - newton for the first time .",
    "we have enough counts to derive the hardness ratio , but not enough for detailed spectral analysis .",
    "the x - ray flux appears to be suppressed by a factor of 17 relative to the intrinsic x - rays estimated from the radio - x - ray correlation , although significant uncertainties are associated with this factor .",
    "if the x - rays are suppressed due to absorption associated with a high column density of neutral hydrogen , the x - rays observed would be much harder , which is inconsistent with the observations .",
    "this implies that the x - ray absorption in j1016 + 5209  is more complicated , such as an ionized absorber , an ionized mirror , or neutral but partially covering the x - ray source .",
    "contributions from a jet are also possible .",
    "high - quality x - ray spectra are necessary to understand the nature of the absorber .",
