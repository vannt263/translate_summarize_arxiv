    "this paper deals with the global dynamics of nonlinear parabolic systems of the form @xmath3 where time variable @xmath4 and space variable @xmath5",

    "a fundamental feature of system  [ init_syst ] is that it can be recast , at least formally , as the gradient flow of an energy functional .",
    "if @xmath11 is a pair of vectors of @xmath7 , let @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the usual euclidean scalar product and the usual euclidean norm , respectively , and let us write simply @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath6 is a solution of system  [ init_syst ] , the _ energy _ ( or _ lagrangian _ or _ action _ ) functional of the solution reads : @xmath16 = \\eee[x\\mapsto u(x , t ) ] = \\int_{\\rr } \\bigl(\\frac{u_x(x , t)^2}{2}+v\\bigl(u(x , t)\\bigr)\\bigr)\\,dx \\,.\\ ] ] its time derivative reads , at least formally , @xmath17 = -\\int_{\\rr } u_t(x , t)^2\\,dx \\le 0 \\,,\\ ] ] and system  [ init_syst ] can formally be rewritten as : @xmath18 \\,.\\ ] ]    if system [ init_syst ] is considered on a _ bounded _ spatial domain with boundary conditions that preserve this gradient structure , then the integrals in  [ form_en ] and  [ dt_form_en ] converge , thus the system is really  and not only formally  of gradient type . in this case",
    "the dynamics is ( at least from a qualitative point of view ) fairly well understood , up to a fine description of the global attractor that is compact and made of the unstable manifolds of stationary solutions @xcite .",
    "according to lasalle s principle , every solution approaches the set of stationary solutions , and even a single stationary solution under rather general additional hypotheses @xcite .",
    "if space is the whole real line and the solutions under consideration are only assumed to be bounded , then the gradient structure above is only formal and allows a much richer phenomenology ( the full attractor is by the way far from being fully understood in this case , see the introduction of @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a salient feature is the occurrence of travelling fronts , that is travelling waves connecting homogeneous equilibria at both ends of space .",
    "those solutions are known to play a major role in the asymptotic behaviour of `` many '' initial conditions .",
    "this crucial role of travelling fronts can be viewed , abstractly , as a consequence of another fundamental feature of system  [ init_syst ] : the fact that a formal gradient structure exists not only in the laboratory frame , but also in every frame travelling at a constant speed . indeed , for every real quantity @xmath19 ,",
    "if a function @xmath6 is a solution of system [ init_syst ] , then the function @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 ( the same function viewed in a frame travelling at speed @xmath19 ) is a solution of @xmath22 and if we consider the energy @xmath23=\\int_{\\rr } e^{cy } \\bigl ( \\frac{v_y(y , t)^2}{2 } + v\\bigl(v(y , t)\\bigr ) \\bigr)\\,dy \\,,\\ ] ] then , at least formally , @xmath24=-\\int_{\\rr } e^{cy } v_t(y , t)^2\\,dy \\,,\\ ] ] and the system  [ syst_mf ] can formally be rewritten as : @xmath25 \\,.\\ ] ] this gradient structure has been known for a long time , but it was not until recently that it received a more detailed attention from several authors ( among them c. b. muratov , th .",
    "gallay , r. joly , and the author @xcite ) , and that it was shown that this structure is sufficient ( in itself , that is without the use of the maximum principle ) to prove results of global convergence towards travelling fronts .",
    "these ideas have been applied since in different contexts , for instance by g. chapuisat @xcite , muratov and m. novaga @xcite , n. d. alikakos and n. i. katzourakis @xcite , c. luo @xcite .    among travelling fronts ,",
    "two main classes can be distinguished : monostable fronts , where an unstable equilibrium is replaced by a stable one , and bistable fronts , where the invaded equilibrium also is stable .",
    "a reasonably wide class of solutions , sufficiently large to capture the convergence to travelling fronts while limiting the complexity of the dynamics encountered is made of solutions that are close to homogeneous equilibria at both ends of space , at least for large times . and",
    "among such initial conditions the simplest case is that of _ bistable _ initial conditions , when those equilibria at both ends of space are stable .    in the late seventies ,",
    "substantial breakthroughs have been achieved by p. c. fife and j. macleod about the global behaviour of such _",
    "bistable _ solutions in the _ scalar _ case ( @xmath8 equals @xmath26 ) .",
    "their results comprise global convergence towards a bistable front @xcite , global convergence towards a `` stacked family of bistable fronts '' @xcite , and finally , in the case of a bistable potential , a rather complete description of the global asymptotic behaviour of all solutions that are sufficiently close , at infinity in space , to the local ( non global ) minimum point @xcite .",
    "note by the way that the gradient structure [ form_grad_mf ] above ( in a travelling referential ) was known to fife and macleod who used it in their initial paper @xcite of 1977 .",
    "several extensions and generalizations of these results have been achieved since , but mostly in the scalar case @xmath27 ( using maximum principles and order - preserving properties of the solutions ) , see the recent papers @xcite and references therein .    the aim of this paper , completing the companion papers @xcite , is to make a step further in this program , by extending these results to the case of _ systems _ of the form [ init_syst ] , and by providing for such systems a complete description of the asymptotic behaviour of every bistable solution ( [ thm:1 ] below ) .",
