    "space discretization of dynamical systems attracted considerable interests among researchers @xcite .",
    "one motivation is to understand the distance between original dynamics and its computer simulation through discretized model . in this paper , we are interested in a discretized planar rotation .",
    "it is very simple but we know surprisingly little on this discretized system .",
    "we start with a conjecture studied by many authors , for e.g. , in @xcite and from a point of view of shift radix system in @xcite .    for all fixed @xmath3 ,",
    "all integer sequences @xmath4 defined by @xmath5 with initial value @xmath6 are periodic .    for @xmath7 , we have @xmath8 and it defines a map @xmath9 on @xmath1 . in other words , we are interested in the dynamics @xmath10 on @xmath1 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 . since the eigenvalues of the matrix are two conjugate complex numbers of modulus one , this dynamics can be regarded as a rotation having invariant confocal ellipses , acting on the lattice @xmath1 .",
    "after the rotation of angle @xmath13 with @xmath14 , we translate by a small vector to make the image lie in @xmath1 .",
    "an affine equivalent formulation using euclidean rotation is found in the next section . from the shape of the inequality in ( [ srs2 ] ) ,",
    "the dynamics ( [ algo ] ) is reversible , i.e. , @xmath15 implies @xmath16 .",
    "thus we have @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath10 is a bijection on @xmath1 . in other words",
    ", @xmath10 is a composition of two involutions @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the conjecture is supported by numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "it is also expected from a heuristic ground : cumulation of errors of @xmath21 from the exact @xmath22 rotation is expected to be small and seemingly impossible to avoid hitting the same lattice points . the cumulative error bound is discussed in @xcite .",
    "however this problem is notorious , and our knowledge is limited .",
    "we only know that conjecture 1 holds for 11 values @xmath23 , see @xcite .",
    "apart from three trivial cases @xmath24 , the proof is highly non trivial and uses the self - inducing structure found in the associated planer piecewise isometry when @xmath25 is rational and @xmath26 is quadratic . if @xmath25 is rational , then we can embed the problem into piecewise isometry acting on a certain higher dimensional torus ( see @xcite , and also @xcite for connection to digital filters ) .",
    "piecewise isometries have zero entropy @xcite , but we know little on their periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that a certain piecewise isometry generated by @xmath27-fold rotation in the plane is governed by several self - inducing structures @xcite , but it is irrelevant to the map @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath26 is a rational number whose denominator is the power of a prime , then the dynamics is understood as the composition of @xmath28-adic rotation and symbolic shift in @xcite , but it seems difficult to extract information on periodic orbits through this embedding . at this stage , we are interested in giving a non trivial general statement for this dynamics . in this note",
    ", we will show    [ main ] for all fixed @xmath0 there are infinitely many periodic orbits of the dynamics ( [ algo ] ) on @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , we prove that there are infinitely many _",
    "symmetric _ periodic orbits ( see  3 for the definition ) .",
    "see corollary [ low ] in  [ gen ] , for a qualitative statement .",
    "theorem [ main ] is new for all @xmath26 except the above @xmath29 values , and gives another support of the conjecture .",
    "note that the idea of observing symmetric periodic orbits dates back to g.  birkhoff , who showed the existence of infinitely many symmetric periodic orbits for the restricted three body problem @xcite , whose dynamics is composed of two involutions .    adding a counting technique of lattice points in number theory",
    ", we can generalize theorem [ main ] to the sequences generated by : @xmath30 for a fixed @xmath31 , as in  [ gen ] , theorem [ main2 ] .",
    "it covers a significant class of discretized rotations , but we do not know how large is this two parameter family within the set of all invertible discretized rotations in @xmath1 , up to conjugacy .",
    "we say @xmath32 is the _ period _ of @xmath33 , if it is the smallest positive integer @xmath28 with @xmath34 .",
    "if there is no such @xmath28 , then @xmath35 is not defined .",
    "it is remarkable that the distribution of periodic orbits drastically changes by whether @xmath25 is irrational or rational .",
    "we have    [ period ] let @xmath25 be irrational and @xmath28 is a positive integer .",
    "then there are only finitely many periodic orbits of period @xmath28 .",
    "this fact follows from theorem 2.1 of @xcite but we give a quick proof in  5 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath25 is rational , in view of the above torus embedding , it is natural to obtain infinitely many periodic orbits of period @xmath28 , which fall into the same period cell .",
    "theorem 4.3 in @xcite gives a concrete example of infinite periodic orbits of period @xmath28 for @xmath36 with an odd prime @xmath28 .    by theorem [ main ] and lemma [ period ] , we know that there exist arbitrary large periods , if @xmath25 is irrational .",
    "we expect the same to hold for all @xmath37 , but there are proofs only for the above eight quadratic cases .",
    "let @xmath14 where @xmath13 is a real number in @xmath38 and let @xmath39 .",
    "our transformation on @xmath40 is written as @xmath41 with @xmath42 . since @xmath43 we view this algorithm as @xmath44 thus it is the dynamics acting on the lattice @xmath45 written as the composition of the euclidean rotation of angle @xmath13 followed by a small translation @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 be a positive real number and @xmath49 be a ball of radius @xmath48 centered at the origin .",
    "define a _ trap region",
    "_ @xmath50 by @xmath51 the situation is demonstrated in figure [ trap ] .",
    ", width=264 ]    now we explain the strategy of the proof .",
    "it is clear from the description of the dynamics , that every unbounded orbit starting from a point in @xmath52 must visit at least once the trap region @xmath50 .",
    "assume that there are only finitely many periodic orbits of ( [ algo2 ] ) .",
    "since we are dealing with dynamics on the lattice @xmath53 , periodicity of an orbit is equivalent to its boundedness .",
    "we argue by contradiction : the assumption that there are just a finite number of periodic orbits would imply that , for @xmath54 , the number of lattice points in @xmath50 are strictly less than the number of symmetric unbounded orbits starting from @xmath49 , which is impossible .",
    "symmetric periodic orbits of time - reversal dynamics had been studied for a long time .",
    "we shall make use of a well - known property which may belong to a folklore .",
    "let @xmath4 be a bi - infinite integer sequence and @xmath55 be an integer .",
    "we say that @xmath4 is periodic , if @xmath56 hold for all @xmath57 .",
    "the sequence @xmath4 is _ symmetric _ at @xmath58 , if @xmath59 holds for all @xmath57 , and it is _ doubly symmetric _ if it is symmetric at @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "[ sym ] if a sequence is doubly symmetric then it is periodic .",
    "moreover symmetric and periodic sequences are doubly symmetric .",
    "assume that @xmath4 is symmetric at @xmath63 and @xmath64 with @xmath62 .",
    "then @xmath65 . let @xmath4 be periodic of period @xmath55 and symmetric at @xmath66 . then @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , this lemma is a restatement of theorems 1 and 2 in @xcite , where symmetric periodic orbits of time reversal dynamics composed of two involutions are studied .",
    "the reader finds precise description on such periodic orbits there",
    ".    let @xmath68 . to the bi - infinite orbit @xmath33",
    "we can associate uniquely the bi - infinite sequence @xmath4 consisting of the 1-st coordinates of the elements of the orbit .",
    "it is clear that @xmath69 is periodic if and only if @xmath4 is periodic .",
    "hereafter we identify the orbit @xmath69 and the bi - infinite sequence @xmath4 and say that an orbit @xmath69 is symmetric if @xmath4 is so .",
    "assume that @xmath4 is symmetric at @xmath58 . if @xmath55 is odd , then @xmath70 and the orbit is of the form : @xmath71 with some @xmath72 and a sequence @xmath73 .",
    "clearly @xmath74 is determined by @xmath75 .",
    "such orbits are in @xmath76 , the set of orbits fixed by the involution @xmath20 . if @xmath55 is even , then @xmath77 and the orbit is of the form @xmath78 for some @xmath79 and @xmath73 .",
    "of course @xmath74 is determined by @xmath75 and @xmath80 .",
    "these orbits belong to @xmath81 , the set fixed by the other involution @xmath82 . by lemma [ sym ] , each periodic orbit of @xmath69 is doubly symmetric .",
    "it belongs to the same fix point set if the period is even , and to the different fix point sets if the period is odd .",
    "not all orbits are symmetric .",
    "for e.g. , if @xmath83 then we have @xmath84 we do not know a way to estimate from below the number of asymmetric orbits .    by our assumption of reductio ad absurdum , there exist only a finite number , say @xmath85 , of periodic orbits . for any @xmath48 ,",
    "the number of points in @xmath52 whose orbits are periodic is less than @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath4 be an unbounded orbit in @xmath76 . by lemma [ sym ]",
    ", @xmath4 can not be doubly symmetric , which implies that two orbits starting from different fixed points in @xmath86 never intersect .",
    "apart from a finite number of exceptions , points of the form @xmath87 generate distinct unbounded orbits . from @xmath88",
    "we conclude that there are at least @xmath89 unbounded orbits in @xmath76 starting from @xmath52 .      similarly , by lemma",
    "[ sym ] , @xmath4 can not be doubly symmetric .",
    "so , by ( [ srs2 ] ) , our task is to count the number of the pairs @xmath91 which satisfy @xmath92 and @xmath93 for this computation , we substitute the inequality ( [ band ] ) by @xmath94 and count the number of pairs @xmath91 satisfying ( [ band2 ] ) and ( [ ball ] ) .",
    "it is clear that for a fixed @xmath80 , there is a unique @xmath75 which satisfies ( [ band2 ] ) . since @xmath95 with @xmath96",
    ", we have @xmath97 from ( [ ball ] ) , and we have at least @xmath98 such points with a non negative constant @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath26 is irrational , then there is no @xmath100 which satisfies either @xmath101 using the symmetry @xmath102 , we see that the number of @xmath91 with ( [ ball ] ) and @xmath103 is exactly one less than the number of @xmath91 with ( [ band ] ) and ( [ ball ] ) , which counts the origin .",
    "thus the number of @xmath91 having ( [ band ] ) and ( [ ball ] ) is at least @xmath104 .",
    "if @xmath26 is rational , then we additionally have to take care of the points @xmath91 on the line @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "however we can easily show that the number of @xmath91 with ( [ ball ] ) on the line @xmath105 and the one on the line @xmath106 differ only by some constant .",
    "thus in any case , there are at least @xmath107 unbounded orbits in @xmath81 starting from @xmath52 with a non negative constant @xmath108 .",
    "by construction , if the trap region @xmath50 and the line @xmath109 has non empty intersection , then it is a half - open interval of length @xmath110 . thus if the line @xmath109 intersects @xmath111 then it is a single point .",
    "the lattice @xmath53 is covered by a family of parallel lines : @xmath112 we easily see that the distance between adjacent lines of @xmath113 is @xmath114 .",
    "thus there are exactly @xmath115 points in @xmath111 .    if @xmath116 , then @xmath117 holds for sufficiently large @xmath48 and we immediately obtain the desired contradiction .    let us take into account the reversibility of @xmath10 . since we are dealing with unbounded symmetric orbits starting from @xmath118 , if @xmath119 then there is an index @xmath120 such that @xmath121",
    "let @xmath122 be defined as follows @xmath123 if an orbit visits @xmath124 then the number of visits is at least two . in other words , we only have to count the number of lattice points up to this symmetry by @xmath125 in @xmath50 .",
    "the mapping @xmath125 is the reflection with respect to the vector @xmath126 , because the two vectors @xmath127 and @xmath128 have the same length .",
    "thus the reflection @xmath125 leaves the vector @xmath129 invariant . to make computation easy , we rotate @xmath50 and @xmath53 by @xmath130 and present the situation in figure [ count ] .",
    ", width=302 ]    @xmath131 , @xmath132 are the images by this rotation and @xmath133 is the corresponding reflection",
    ". then every line @xmath134 with @xmath135 $ ] contains a single point in @xmath136 and the reflection @xmath133 leaves the vector @xmath137 invariant .",
    "so our task is to estimate from above the number of lattice points in @xmath136 which are below the line @xmath138 .",
    "the intersection of the line and the boundary of @xmath131 with the largest @xmath139-coordinate is @xmath140 and we have @xmath141 we count the number of points whose @xmath139-coordinate does not exceed this value , i.e. , the points in the shaded part in figure [ count ] .",
    "thus the number of lattice points up to symmetry in @xmath142 is bounded from above by @xmath143 with a non negative constant @xmath144 .",
    "from the assumption that there are only finitely many periodic orbits , we derived several estimates in the previous sections . by lemma [ sym ] , unbounded orbits in @xmath76 and those in @xmath81 have no intersection .",
    "thus @xmath145 distinct unbounded orbits must visit @xmath50 and there are only @xmath146 lattice points in @xmath142 up to symmetry .",
    "however @xmath147 does not hold for sufficiently large @xmath48 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ main ] is finished .",
    "let us show lemma [ period ] .",
    "assume that there are infinitely many @xmath148 that @xmath34 with @xmath149 .",
    "by induction using ( [ algo2 ] ) , we have @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 . here",
    "@xmath153 is the euclidean norm .",
    "however if @xmath154 is sufficiently large , then @xmath155 here @xmath66 is computed as the operator norm : @xmath156 which is positive since @xmath25 is irrational .",
    "this gives a contradiction .",
    "one can generalize the result to the sequences defined by : @xmath157 with @xmath31 .",
    "this kind of interval shifts are studied , for e.g. , in @xcite . in complete analogy to our main result",
    ", we have    [ main2 ] for a fixed @xmath0 and @xmath31 , there are infinitely many periodic orbits of the dynamics @xmath158 on @xmath1 .    we can deduce a qualitative statement :    [ low ] there is a positive constant @xmath159 depending on @xmath26 and @xmath160 such that within @xmath49 , there are at least @xmath161 periodic orbits of ( [ srseta ] ) .",
    "hereafter we sketch the proof of theorem [ main2 ] and corollary [ low ] .",
    "putting @xmath162 , the inequality becomes @xmath163 therefore by substituting @xmath53 with @xmath164 , our algorithm has exactly the same shape as ( [ algo2 ] ) .",
    "though the error term becomes worse than the one in  4 , we can show that the number of lattice points of @xmath132 up to symmetry within the trap region is @xmath165 for any positive constant @xmath166 .",
    "here we used the method of vinogradov to count the number of lattice points in the cylindrical region bounded by curves of positive curvature , for e.g. , see p.8 - 22 of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "similarly to  3 , there are @xmath167 unbounded orbits in @xmath76 .",
    "we count unbounded orbits in @xmath81 , i.e. , the number of @xmath91 , which satisfy : @xmath168 and ( [ yrange ] ) .",
    "if @xmath26 is irrational , then @xmath169 is uniformly distributed and the number of such @xmath80 s is @xmath170 .",
    "when @xmath26 is rational , put @xmath171 with @xmath172 .",
    "then @xmath173 for @xmath174 with the same frequency @xmath175 .",
    "let us study the case that @xmath176 is even .",
    "since @xmath177 has cardinality @xmath178 , the number of points with ( [ ud ] ) and ( [ yrange ] ) is again @xmath170 .",
    "once we have this estimate @xmath170 then @xmath179 does not hold for sufficiently large @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath85 appears only once in the left side , because it is the number of periodic orbits of the system .",
    "we obtain the contradiction for @xmath180 .",
    "it remains to show the case when @xmath176 is odd .",
    "then @xmath177 has cardinality either @xmath181 or @xmath182 depending on @xmath160 .",
    "thus the number of unbounded orbits in @xmath81 is bounded from below by @xmath183 .",
    "thus we have to show that @xmath184 for large @xmath48 .",
    "this is valid because @xmath185 holds for @xmath186 , since @xmath187 .",
    "the validity of statement of corollary [ low ] is invariant under affine transformations fixing the origin , up to appropriate changes the constant @xmath159 . to prove corollary [ low ] , note that we may take @xmath188 with a small @xmath189 in the above proof to get the same contradiction . here",
