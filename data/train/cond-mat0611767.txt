    "the criticality of the ising model above the upper critical dimension ( @xmath1 ) belongs to the mean - field universality class .",

    "recently , jones and young performed an extensive monte carlo simulation for the @xmath0 ising model embedded in the ( periodic ) hypercubic geometry @xcite .",

    "they found that the correlation length @xmath24 obeys the scaling relation , @xmath25 with the linear dimension @xmath3 and the reduced temperature @xmath4 .",
    "they found that the scaling indices are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction @xcite , @xmath26    notably enough , their indices exclude the naively expected values , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "( in other words , the spin - wave excitation costs very little energy for large @xmath3 . )",
    "such a peculiarity should be attributed to the violation of the conventional scaling relation ( hyperscaling ) in @xmath1 .",
    "it would be intriguing that the above formula is cast into the expression @xcite , @xmath30 with the replacements @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the expression is now reminiscent of the conventional scaling relation expected for the mean - field universality class .",
    "namely , the violation of hyperscaling is reconciled ( absorbed ) by the replacements , and the scaling indices , @xmath7 and @xmath33 , characterize the anomaly quantitatively .",
    "so far , numerous considerations have been made @xcite for the hypercubic geometry , where the monte carlo method works very efficiently .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate the @xmath0 ising model embedded in the cylindrical geometry ; namely , we consider a system with infinite system size along a particular direction . clearly , the transfer - matrix method well suits exploiting such a geometry .",
    "however , practically , the transfer - matrix method does not apply very well in large dimensions @xmath34 because of its severe limitation as to the available system sizes .    in order to resolve this limitation",

    "the motivation of the present research is well directed to methodology .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] , we explain our simulation scheme in detail . in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] , we manage the finite - size - scaling analyses of the simulation data . in the last section",
    ", we present the summary and discussions .",
    "in this section , we explain the numerical method .",
    "first , we argue the reduction of the @xmath0 ising model to the @xmath41 quantum transverse - field ising model .",
    "the reduced ( quantum mechanical ) model is much easier to treat numerically .",
    "second , we explicate novotny s transfer - matrix method .",
    "we place an emphasis how we extended his formalism to adopt the quantum - mechanical interaction .",
    "the @xmath42-dimensional ising model reduces to the @xmath43-dimensional transverse - field ising model ; in general , the @xmath42-dimensional classical system has its @xmath43-dimensional quantum counterpart @xcite .",
    "such a reduction is based on the observation that the transfer - matrix direction and the ( quantum ) imaginary - time evolution have a close relationship .",
    "actually , the quantum hamiltonian is an infinitesimal generator of the transfer matrix . because the quantum hamiltonian contains few non - zero elements , its diagonalization requires reduced computational effort .",
    "the significant point is that the universality class ( criticality ) is maintained through the mapping .",
    "to be specific , we consider the following @xmath41 transverse - field ising model with the extended interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by , @xmath44 } \\sigma^z_i \\sigma^z_j -j_4 \\sum_{[[ij ] ] } \\sigma^z_i \\sigma^z_j   -\\gamma \\sum_i",
    "\\sigma^x_i   -h \\sum_i \\sigma^z_i      .\\ ] ] here , the operators @xmath45 denote the pauli matrices placed at the @xmath41 hypercubic lattice points @xmath46 .",
    "the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath5 stand for the transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields , respectively . the summations , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50}$ ] , and @xmath51}$ ] , run over all possible nearest - neighbor pairs , the next - nearest - neighbor ( plaquette diagonal ) pairs , the third - neighbor pairs , and the fourth - neighbor pairs , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) are the corresponding coupling constants .",
    "hereafter , we regard @xmath54 as a unit of energy ( @xmath55 ) , and tune the remaining coupling constants @xmath56 so as to eliminate the insystematic finite - size errors ; see sec .",
    "[ section3 ] .",
    "we simulate the above @xmath41 quantum ising model with the numerical diagonalization method .",
    "the diagonalization of such a high - dimensional system requires huge computer - memory space .",
    "in fact , the number of spins constituting the @xmath41 cluster increases very rapidly as @xmath57 , overwhelming the available computer resources . in the next section ,",
    "we resolve this difficulty through resorting to novotny s transfer - matrix formalism .",
    "in this section , we present an explicit representation for the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "we make use of novotny s method @xcite , which enables us to treat an arbitrary number of spins constituting a unit of the transfer matrix .",
    "novotny formulated the idea for the classical ising model . in this paper , we show that his idea is applicable to the quantum ising model , eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , as well .",
    "before we commence a detailed discussion , we explain the basic idea of novotny s method . in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , we presented a schematic drawing of a unit of the transfer matrix for the ising model in @xmath58 ( rather than @xmath0 for the sake of simplicity ) . because the cross - section of the @xmath58-dimensional bar is @xmath59-dimensional , the transfer - matrix unit should have a @xmath59-dimensional structure .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , the spins @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) constitute a @xmath63-dimensional ( zig - zag ) structure .",
    "this feature is essential for us to construct the transfer - matrix unit with an arbitrary ( integral ) number of spins .",
    "the dimensionality is lifted to @xmath59 effectively by the long - range interactions over the @xmath64th - neighbor pairs ; owing to the long - range interaction , the @xmath9 spins constitute a @xmath65 rectangular network .",
    "( the significant point is that the number @xmath64 is not necessarily an integral nor rational number . ) similarly , the bridge over @xmath66th neighbor pairs introduces the next - nearest - neighbor ( plaquette diagonal ) couping with respect to the @xmath65 network .",
    "we apply this idea to the case of the @xmath41 _ quantum _ system . to begin with",
    ", we set up the hilbert - space bases @xmath67 ( @xmath61 ) for the quantum spins @xmath45 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "these bases diagonalize the operator @xmath69 ; namely , @xmath70 holds .",
    "we consider the one- and two - body interactions separately .",
    "namely , we decompose the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) into two sectors , @xmath71 the component @xmath72 originates from the spin - spin interaction , which depends on the exchange couplings @xmath52 . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution @xmath73 comes from the single - spin terms , depending on the magnetic fields , @xmath47 and @xmath5 .",
    "first , we consider @xmath72",
    ". this component concerns the mutual connectivity among the @xmath9 spins , and we apply novotny s idea to represent the matrix elements .",
    "we propose the following expression , @xmath74 here , the set @xmath75 consists of the elements , @xmath76 .",
    "the component @xmath77 denotes the @xmath78th - neighbor interaction for the @xmath9-spin alignment , @xmath79 with the exchange - interaction matrix , @xmath80 and the translational operator @xmath81 satisfying , @xmath82 under the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the insertion of @xmath83 beside the @xmath84 operation is a key element to introduce the coupling over the @xmath78th - neighbor pairs .",
    "the denominator @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) compensates the duplicated sum .",
    "let us explain the meaning of the above formula , eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) , more in detail . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , in the case of @xmath59 , we made bridges over @xmath86th - neighbor pairs to lift up the dimensionality to @xmath59 effectively . in the case of @xmath41 , by analogy",
    ", we introduce the interaction distances such as @xmath87 and @xmath88 . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) thus represents the nearest - neighbor interactions ( with respect to the @xmath41-dimensional cluster ) .",
    "similarly , the remaining terms introduce the long - range interactions .",
    "for example , the component @xmath89 introduces the next - nearest - neighbor ( plaquette diagonal ) interaction .",
    "we emphasize that the idea of novotny is readily applicable to the quantum model .",
    "[ in short , our ( quantum mechanical ) formulation is additive . on the contrary ,",
    "novotny s original formulation is multiplicative , because his original formulation concerns the boltzmann weight rather than the hamiltonian itself . ]",
    "lastly , we consider the one - body part @xmath73 .",
    "the matrix element is given by the formula , @xmath90 the expression is quite standard , because the component @xmath73 simply concerns the individual spins , and has nothing to do with the connectivity among them .",
    "the above formulas complete our basis to simulate the quantum hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) numerically . in the next section ,",
