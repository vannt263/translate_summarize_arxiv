    "while the physics of high-@xmath0 cuprate has matured after the two decades since the discovery , the superconductivity the iron - based pnictide lafeaso doped with fluorine discovered by hosono s group@xcite is more than welcome as a fresh challenge for yet another class of high-@xmath0 systems .",
    "indeed , the iron - based material , along with various other ones in the same family of compounds with higher transition temperatures ( @xmath0)@xcite , are remarkable as the first non - copper compound that has @xmath0 s exceeding 50 k. this immediately stimulates renewed interests in the electronic mechanism of high @xmath0 superconductivity . in order to investigate the pairing mechanism , here we first construct an electronic model for lafeaso@xmath1f@xmath2 using maximally localised wannier orbitals obtained from first principles calculation .",
    "the minimal model turns out to involve all the five fe @xmath3 orbitals.@xcite hence the iron - based material is contrasted with the cuprate , which is a one - band , doped mott insulator .",
    "we then apply the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) to solve the eliashberg equation .",
    "we conclude that a nesting between multiple fermi surface ( pockets ) results in a development of a peculiar spin fluctuation mode , which in turn realises an unconventional pairing , which is basically an extended @xmath4-wave where the gap function changes sign across the nesting vector.@xcite the result is intriguing as a realisation of the general idea that the way in which electron correlation effects appear is very sensitive to the underlying band structure and the shape of the fermi surface.@xcite",
    "lafeaso has a layered structure , where fe atoms form a square lattice in each layer , which is sandwiched by as atoms.@xcite due to the tetrahedral coordination of as atoms , there are two fe atoms per unit cell .",
    "the experimentally determined lattice constants are @xmath5  and @xmath6 , with two internal coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8.@xcite we have first obtained the band structure ( fig.[fig1 ] ) for these coordinates with the density - functional approximation with plane - wave basis@xcite , which is then used to construct the maximally localised wannier functions ( mlwfs)@xcite . these mlwfs , centered at the two fe sites in the unit cell , have five orbital symmetries ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 refer to those for this unit cell with two fe sites as shown in the bottom panel of fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the two wannier orbitals in each unit cell are equivalent in that each fe atom has the same local arrangement of other atoms .",
    "we can then take a unit cell that contains only one orbital per symmetry by unfolding the brillouin zone,@xcite and we end up with an effective five - band model on a square lattice , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 axes are rotated by 45 degrees from @xmath17-@xmath18 .",
    "we refer all the wave vectors in the unfolded brillouin zone hereafter .",
    "we define the band filling @xmath19 as the number of electrons / number of sites ( e.g. , @xmath20 for full filling ) .",
    "the doping level @xmath15 in lafeaso@xmath1f@xmath2 is related to the band filling as @xmath21 .",
    "the five bands are heavily entangled as shown in fig.[fig2 ] ( left panel ) reflecting strong hybridisation of the five @xmath22 orbitals , which is physically due to the tetrahedral coordination of as atoms around fe .",
    "hence we conclude that the minimal electronic model requires all the five bands . in fig.[fig2](right ) , the fermi surface for @xmath23 ( corresponding to @xmath24 ) obtained by ignoring the inter - layer hoppings is shown in the two - dimensional unfolded brillouin zone .",
    "the fermi surface consists of four pieces ( pockets in 2d ) : two concentric hole pockets ( denoted here as @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) centered around @xmath27 , two electron pockets around @xmath28 @xmath29 or @xmath30 @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "@xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) corresponds to the fermi surface around the @xmath34z line ( ma in the original brillouin zone ) in the first - principles band calculation.@xcite besides these pieces of the fermi surface , there is a portion of the band near @xmath35 that is flat and touches the @xmath36 at @xmath23 , so that the portion acts as a `` quasi fermi surface @xmath37 '' around @xmath35 , which has in fact an important contribution to the spin susceptibility . as for the orbital character , @xmath38 and portions of @xmath39 near brillouin zone edge have mainly @xmath10 and @xmath11 character , while the portions of @xmath39 away from the brillouin zone edge and @xmath40 have mainly @xmath12 orbital character ( fig.[fig3 ] , bottom panels ) .",
    "an interesting feature in the band structure is the presence of dirac cones , i.e. , places where the upper and the lower bands make a conical contact .",
    "@xcite the ones closest to the fermi level lies at positions where the @xmath12 and the @xmath41 bands cross , just below the @xmath39 fermi surface .",
    "( fe ) , @xmath42 ( as below the fe plane ) and @xmath43 ( above ) .",
    "[ fig1],width=377 ]     in the unfolded brillouin zone , where the original bz is indicated by dashed lines .",
    "the blue ( red ) portions have strong @xmath44 character . dashed blue curves represent the portions where a @xmath45 charactered band lies very close to the fermi energy for @xmath23 , which actually become a fermi surface for smaller doping .",
    "[ fig2],width=604 ]",
    "we consider a two - dimensional model where the inter - layer hoppings are neglected . for the many body part of the hamiltonian , we consider the standard interaction terms that comprise the intra - orbital coulomb @xmath46 , the inter - orbital coulomb @xmath47 , the hund s coupling @xmath48 and the pair - hopping @xmath49 .",
    "the many body hamiltonian then reads @xmath50 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 denote the sites and @xmath52 the orbitals , and @xmath53 is the transfer energy obtained in the previous section .",
    "the orbitals @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are labeled as @xmath54 and 5 , respectively . as for the electron - electron interactions ,",
    "there have been some theoretical studies that estimate the parameter values .",
    "some give @xmath55,@xcite while others @xmath56.@xcite we assume here that @xmath55 , and take the values @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 throughout the study .",
    "these values are smaller than the values obtained in ref.@xcite because the self energy correction is not taken into account in the present calculation , so that small values of interaction parameters are necesssary to avoid magnetic ordering at high temperatures .    having constructed the model , we move on to the rpa calculation , where the modification of the band structure due to the self - energy correction is not taken into account .",
    "multiorbital rpa is described in e.g. ref.@xcite . in the present case ,",
    "green s function @xmath60 @xmath61 is a @xmath62 matrix .",
    "the irreducible susceptibility matrix @xmath63 @xmath64 has @xmath65 components , and the spin and the charge ( orbital ) susceptibility matrices are obtained from matrix equations , @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 we denote the largest eigenvalue of the spin susceptibility matrix for @xmath69 as @xmath70 .",
    "the green s function and the effective singlet pairing interaction , @xmath71 are plugged into the linearised eliashberg equation , @xmath72 the @xmath62 matrix gap function @xmath73 in the orbital representation along with the associated eigenvalue @xmath74 are obtained by solving this equation .",
    "the gap function can be transformed into the band representation with a unitary transformation .",
    "the temperature is fixed at @xmath75ev throughout the study , and @xmath76 @xmath77-point meshes and 1024 matsubara frequencies are taken .",
    "we find that the spin fluctuations dominate in magnitude over orbital fluctuations as far as @xmath78 , so we can characterise the system with the spin susceptibility .",
    "for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath23 and @xmath75 ( in ev ) .",
    "middle panels : diagonal components , @xmath79(left ) and @xmath80(right ) , of the spin susceptibility matrix in the orbital representation ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "bottom panel : nesting is shown for the fermi surface for orbitals @xmath82 ( left ) and for @xmath45 ( right ) . here",
    "the thickness of the fermi surface represents the strength of the respective orbital character .",
    "the gray areas around the corners in the left panel indicates the @xmath40 `` quasi '' fermi surface .",
    "[ fig3],width=377 ]    let us first look at the key ingredient : the spin susceptibility in the top panel of fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath83 has peaks around @xmath84 , @xmath30 .",
    "in addition we note that there is a ridge extending from @xmath85 to @xmath86 around @xmath35 .",
    "to explore the origin of these spin structures , we show @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the middle of fig.[fig3 ] , which represent the spin correlation within @xmath11 and @xmath12 orbitals , respectively .",
    "@xmath79 peaks solely around @xmath28 and @xmath30 , which reflects the nesting between the @xmath87-charactered portions of @xmath38 and @xmath39 fermi pockets as shown in a bottom panel of fig.[fig3 ] . on the other hand , @xmath80 has peaks around @xmath88 and around @xmath89 as well .",
    "the former is due to the nesting between the @xmath40 quasi fermi surface and the @xmath12 portion of the @xmath39 fermi surface as was first pointed out in ref.@xcite , while the latter originates from the nesting between the @xmath12 portion of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 fermi surfaces.@xcite the @xmath88 feature is consistent with the stripe ( i.e. , collinear ) antiferromagnetic order for the undoped case , which was suggested by transport and optical reflectance,@xcite and further confirmed by neutron scattering experiments.@xcite the stabilization of such an antiferromagnetic ordering has also been pointed out in first principles calculations.@xcite",
    "the presence of multiple set of nesting vectors revealed above provides an interesting case of the gap function in a spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity , since multiple nestings can not only cooperate but also compete with each other .",
    "namely , the @xmath38-@xmath39 and @xmath40-@xmath39 nestings tend to favour the sign reversing @xmath4-wave pairing , in which the gap changes sign between @xmath38 and @xmath39 with a fixed sign ( i.e. , full gap ) on each of the fermi surface.@xcite on the other hand , @xmath92 nesting tends to change the sign of the gap between these two pockets , which can result in either @xmath3-wave pairing or an @xmath4-wave pairing with nodes on the @xmath39 fermi surface@xcite . for the band structure of lafeaso",
    "( obtained by using the experimentally determined lattice structure ) , the @xmath28 spin fluctuation dominates , and the sign - reversing @xmath4-wave with no nodes on the fermi pockets dominates for the present set of parameter values.@xcite in fig.[fig4 ] , we show the gap function in the band representation for the third and the forth bands , which produce the @xmath26 and @xmath39 fermi surfaces , respectively . a number of theoretical studies that adopt effective two band models , @xcite the present five band model,@xcite or a 16 band @xmath93 model@xcite have also found that this sign reversing @xmath4-wave is a good candidate of the gap function in this material .",
    "the sign change in the @xmath4-wave gap is analogous to those in models studied by bulut _",
    "et al._,@xcite and also by the present author for the disconnected fermi surfaces@xcite .",
    "it is also reminiscent of the unconventional @xmath4-wave pairing mechanism for na@xmath2coo@xmath94h@xmath95o@xcite proposed by kuroki et al.@xcite    .",
    "[ fig4],width=302 ]    we have to realise , however , that the gap can vary significantly along the @xmath39 fermi surface , and also between different pieces of the fermi surface due to the multiorbital character of the system . in the present case ,",
    "the gap for the @xmath12-charactered portion of the @xmath39 fermi surface is about twice as large as that for the @xmath87-charactered portions , namely near the brillouin zone edge of the @xmath39 fermi surface and on the @xmath25 , @xmath26 fermi surface .",
    "however , we find , in further calculations , that this gap variance is not universal , and depends strongly on the electron density and also on the details of the band structure .",
    "this is because the @xmath96 nesting and thus the @xmath28 vs. @xmath85 spin fluctuation competition is sensitively affected by the position of the @xmath12 portion of the band near @xmath35 with respect to the fermi level .",
    "the details of this band filling and band structure dependences will be published elsewhere .",
    "to summarise , we have constructed a five - band electronic model for lafeaso@xmath1f@xmath2 , which we consider to be the minimum microscopic model for the iron - based superconductor . applying a five - band rpa to this model",
    ", we have found that spin - fluctuation modes around @xmath88 develop due to the nesting between disconnected fermi surfaces .",
    "based on the linearised eliashberg equation , we have concluded that multiple spin fluctuation modes realises unconventional , extended @xmath4-wave pairing , where the gap changes sign across the nesting vectors .",
    "so the general picture obtained here is that the iron compound is a multi - band system having electron and hole pockets , as sharply opposed to the cuprate which is a one - band and nearly half - filled system with a simply connected fermi surface .",
    "this poses a challenging future problem of elaborating respective pros and cons for the iron compound and the cuprate for superconductivity .",
    "we wish to thank ryotaro arita , seiichiro onari , hidetomo usui , yukio tanaka , and hiroshi kontani for a collaboration in ref.@xcite and for valuable discussions .",
    "numerical calculations were performed at the information technology center , university of tokyo , and at the supercomputer center , issp , university of tokyo . this study has been supported by grants - in - aid for scientific research from mext of japan and from the japan society for the promotion of science .",
