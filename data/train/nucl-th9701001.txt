    "this approach applies a constraint so that the expectation value of the angular momentum is , on average , equal to @xmath30 . as such , at higher spins , large variations in the projected angular momentum , which can be measured by computing the variance of @xmath30 , can be expected .    in the case of applying the saddle - point integration before integrating over the deformation degrees of freedom ,",
    "one obtains a rotational frequency , @xmath41 , for each deformation and orientation that is given by @xmath42 it is an open question as to which choice of performing the integration over @xmath29 leads to a better evaluation of the nuclear partition function , and , by extension , the expectation value of spin - dependent observables .",

    "indeed , since there are shapes for which @xmath52 , there are orientations in which @xmath53 diverges to infinity",
    ". these apparent divergences , however , are brought under control by a similar factor in the exponential of the free energy + @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the second limit of interest is the case where the nuclear moments of inertia assume the rigid - body values , @xmath55 $ ] with @xmath56 . in this case , the effective volume element is similar to @xmath16 $ ] . shown in fig .",

    "as can be seen in the figure , the effective volume element obtained with the rigid - body moments of inertia differs from @xmath16 $ ] for @xmath60 by at most a factor of 2.5 .",
    "this difference is not readily observable in the partition function ( or observables of the gdr ) for temperatures less than 2  mev because the integral in eq.([e : eq7 ] ) is dominated by the free energy in the exponential . in fact , for such large values of @xmath1 the free energy is often larger than the minimum value by 20  mev or more , and , consequently , is suppressed by the exponential factor .    as a further illustration of the effects of angular momentum projection , density distributions for the effective weight function @xmath61 $ ]",

    "_ , which is based on finite temperature , extended thomas - fermi calculations  @xcite . in the figure ,",
    "the darker shaded areas reflect the largest weight .",
    "note that the weight functions obtained for the angular momentum projected case using rigid - body moments of inertia are very similar in shape to the fixed @xmath29 method .",
    "there is , however , an important difference . in the fixed @xmath29 method ,",
    "each of the three regions have the same relative weight , whereas , in the case of projected angular momentum , the weight function is asymmetric in the three regions .",
    "this is due to an angular anisotropy in the factor @xmath63 , which arises , in part , from fluctuations of the rotational frequency while projecting angular momentum .",
    "although this factor essentially allows for an exact computation of the partition function at the mean field level via eq .",
    "( [ e : eq7 ] ) , the anisotropy in the effective volume element can have important consequences for observables of the gdr .",
    "in particular , it will be shown in the section  [ sec : compare ] that although the total gdr strength function is essentially unaffected , the angular distribution @xmath25-coefficient ( defined in the next section ) is , and is one motivation for using the projection method outlined below for just projecting @xmath64 .",
    "the nuclear moments of inertia can be evaluated from cranked nilsson - strutinsky calculations , which , at high temperature , tend towards the rigid - body limit . at low temperature , however , significant corrections due to shell structure and the pairing interaction may be present , and the moments of inertia may correspond to a mixture of the two limits . in practice , however , the moments of inertia never correspond solely to the irrotational limit , as this would preclude angular momentum built up of non - collective single - particle excitations .",
    "an important difference between these two methods of projecting angular momentum has to do with the presence of a fission barrier at finite spin . in the fixed rotational frequency scheme",
    ", there is always a saddle point in the free energy along the prolate collective axes for @xmath65 .",
    "the position and height of the saddle point naturally decreases with increasing rotational frequency , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] , where the free energy in the fixed rotational frequency approach is plotted for the nucleus @xmath26sn at a temperature @xmath66  mev for rotational frequencies @xmath67 , 0.56 , 1.02 , and 1.31  mev , which approximately correspond to angular momentum values 0 , 20 , 40 , and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "given the presence of the fission barrier , care must be taken when computing the partition function and accounting for the effects of large - amplitude thermal fluctuations on the gdr since beyond the saddle point the free energy decreases to @xmath69 , and from a technical point of view , the integral over all quadrupole degrees of freedom is unbound . in this case , the integration over @xmath1 must be limited to values below the saddle point . on the other hand , using the method of eq .",
    "( [ e : eq7 ] ) , there is no saddle point in the free energy , and the integration over the quadrupole degrees of freedom is always bound .",
    "in addition , as a function of angular momentum , the mean - field nuclear shape displays three distinct characteristics instead of two as in the case of fixed rotational frequency . at low",
    "spin and temperature , the shape is governed by the ground state , equilibrium shape .",
    "for example , for a deformed nucleus , a prolate shape undergoing a collective rotation about an axis perpendicular to the symmetry axis . as the spin and temperature increase , the nucleus makes a transition to an oblate shape rotating about the symmetry axis , while at very high spins , the nucleus undergoes the jacobi transition , which is characterized by a sudden change to a prolate shape with a very large deformation rotating about an axis perpendicular to the two symmetry axes .",
    "note that only the first two regimes are present in the fixed rotational frequency method of projecting the angular momentum .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that instead of projecting the total angular momentum onto the partition function via eq .",
    "( [ e : eq4 ] ) , it may be more appropriate in some cases to approximate total @xmath30 projection with just projecting the @xmath24-component of the angular momentum , @xmath33 . in this case , the partition function becomes , @xmath70}{{\\cal i}(\\beta,\\gamma,\\theta,\\psi)^{1/2 } }   \\exp\\left [ -f(t,\\alpha , m)/t \\right ] , \\label{e : z_proj}\\ ] ] where the free energy is given by @xmath71 and the saddle - point frequency is given by @xmath72 .",
    "the expectation value of a scalar observable , such as the total cross section of the giant - dipole resonance follows in a similar manner as the partition function .",
    "this is primarily because scalar observables commute with the angular momentum projection operator . in particular , the response function of the giant - dipole is proportional to the fourier transform of the `` real''-time autocorrelation function @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the @xmath75-component of the isovector dipole transition operator and @xmath76 is an angular momentum projection operator . because of its high collectivity , the cross section of the gdr is often approximated by harmonic vibrations along the three principal nuclear axes with frequencies proportional to the inverse of the radius of each axis  @xcite . within this framework ,",

    "[ f : fig4 ] and [ f : fig5 ] , it is apparent that for @xmath27pb both the width of the total cross section and the @xmath25-coefficient exhibit a weaker dependence on angular momentum than for @xmath26sn .",
    "this is primarily due to the larger moment of inertia in pb that leads to both a smaller splitting between the @xmath89-components of the gdr and a smaller angular anisotropy .",
    "another important difference between @xmath27pb and @xmath106sn is the influence of shell corrections .",
    "the most important of these are the shell corrections to the free energy at zero angular momentum , which in @xmath27pb are quite strong and tend to enhance the spherical shape at lower temperatures .",
    "in addition , because of the closed - shell structure of @xmath27pb , shell corrections also have a strong effect on the moments of inertia .",
    "indeed , in ref .  @xcite it was found that shell corrections reduce the moment of inertia for the spherical shape by over 40% at zero temperature .",

    "in addition , the ratio @xmath112 is shown in the lower left - hand panel , where it is seen that without the @xmath108 factor the spherical shape would have approximately 40% more weight when shell corrections to the moments of inertia are included .    at higher spins , the shell corrections to the moment of inertia in @xmath27pb",
    "only have a moderate effect on the total gdr cross section and the @xmath25-coefficient .",
    "this is despite the fact that these shell corrections significantly reduce the moment of inertia from the rigid - body value for nearly spherical shapes .",
    "the principal effect of the shell corrections would be to give to a slightly larger deformation along oblate non - collective axis in the minimum of the total free energy .",
    "note from panel ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ f : fig6 ] , however , that these shell corrections tend to damp out quickly for increasing @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",

    ", we note that to some degree all three methods lead to similar results with various degrees of problems in different regions .",
    "given that the @xmath64-projection method can account for the jacobi transition at high spin , whereas the fixed rotational frequency procedure can not , and that it leads to more reasonable @xmath25-coefficients for lowest values of angular momentum than does the full @xmath30-projection method , it is likely that the best all around method for describing the gdr in a hot nucleus at high spin is the @xmath64- projection method .",
    "we found that the choice of the method for projecting angular momentum onto the nuclear partition function can affect the sampling of large - amplitude thermal fluctuations of the nuclear shape .",
    "in particular , angular momentum projection can lead to an effective volume element that depends on the moments of inertia of the system .",
    "we have shown that in the case of irrotational - flow moments of inertia , the effective volume element scales as @xmath23 , whereas in the rigid - body limit , @xmath48 $ ] differs only slightly from the standard value of @xmath115 .    in practical terms , the three methods give essentially the same cross section for low to medium values of angular momentum . at higher angular momentum ,",
    "the fixed rotational frequency procedure has a decreasing fission barrier that tends to favor prolate collective shapes , but is essentially unbound , as beyond the barrier the integrand tends to infinity .",
    "in contrast , both the @xmath30- and @xmath64-projection methods have weight functions that are always bound and exhibit the jacobi transition at very high spin .",
