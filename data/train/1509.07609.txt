    "as well as integer quantum hall effect ( qhe ) under a magnetic field@xcite , the quantum anomalous hall effect ( qahe ) without an external magnetic field@xcite is characterized by nonzero chern number , a topological invariant associated with occupied bands@xcite .",
    "this nonzero chern number @xmath0 gives rise to edge states in the bulk gap , which carry the remarkably perfect quantization of the hall conductance @xmath1 ( in units of @xmath2 hereafter ) .",
    "inspired by the investigations of topological insulators@xcite , qahes in concrete materials have been theoretically proposed @xcite and been experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "although robust against weak disorder , topological phases will be localized into anderson insulators ultimately , by sufficiently strong disorder@xcite . microscopically speaking ,",
    "this can be viewed as a disorder induced topological phase transition , i.e. , change of the topological invariant ( @xmath3 ) due to a band touching , i.e. , gap closing and re - opening@xcite .",
    "topological phases with different chern numbers are topologically distinct from each other .",
    "each of them corresponds to a _",
    "stable _ fixed point in the sense of renormalization group ( rg)@xcite , which offers another explanation for their robustness .",
    "numerical calculations for a qhe with a high chern number @xmath4 show that , with the increasing of disorder strength , the hall conductance @xmath1 vanishes to 0 persistently without showing any intermediate hall plateaus with chern numbers @xmath5@xcite , which are also associated with stable fixed points and therefore should be robust .",
    "the quantum hall state with @xmath4 is ascribed to contributions from individual occupied landau levels with @xmath6 .",
    "disorder makes the landau levels broaden .",
    "after adjacent landau levels are broadened enough to touch each other , their chern numbers change from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , which results in trivial localized bands .",
    "the most essential observation is that , this disorder induced topological transitions happen to _ all _ landau levels almost at similar disorder strength , which means a nearly simultaneous breakdown of all landau levels@xcite .",
    "therefore , after disorder ensemble average , any intermediate topological state with only a fraction of the landau levels surviving can not stably manifests itself .",
    "lattice models for qahe with a single valence band carrying a high chern number @xmath4 were proposed recently@xcite .",
    "the localization process with increasing disorder strength for a two - band model with @xmath9 was investigated by transport calculations @xcite .",
    "it was found that its hall conductance still decays from 2 persistently to 0 without a plateau 1 . now since one single band carries @xmath9 , the above picture of simultaneous breakdowns for all landau levels ( each carrying @xmath6 ) for qhe@xcite does not apply .",
    "without special symmetry protection , the band touching induced by a single parameter ( disorder strength here ) is linearly shaped and only changes the chern number by 1@xcite . therefore , the topological origin of above phenomenon seems to be confusing .",
    "does this correspond to a topological phase transition from two band - touching points happening simultaneously , or from a single band - touching point changing the chern number by 2 ?    in this manuscript , based on the language of disordered supercells@xcite , we investigate the topological origin of the localization process for qahe with chern number 2 @xmath10 0 .",
    "we find that , with the increasing of disorder strength @xmath11 , this transition corresponds to two successive band - touchings which happen at different disorder strengths @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and at different positions @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "the intermediate @xmath6 window @xmath16 is small and highly configuration dependent , which makes it hardly observable after disorder averaging and size scaling .",
    "this vulnerability of intermediate @xmath6 state can not be improved even if we generalize the original model to make the gap at one valley much smaller than at other valleys ( thus with the expectation that the band - touching at the smallest gap should be much earlier ) .",
    "finally , based on finite - size scaling of mesoscopic conductances , we summarize the results into a diagram of rg flows , which can be tested by experiments@xcite or field theoretical analysis@xcite .",
    "we use a generalized version of the two - band model recently proposed@xcite .",
