    "@xmath163 has only one `` hump '' for @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "comparison of @xmath153 computed for @xmath164 ( solid lines ) and @xmath165 ( dashed lines ) edges of each photonic band shows ( fig .",
    "[ bmrk ] ) that the difference occurs in the spacial regions where the electromagnetic waves propagate via tunneling mechanism in language of crows of section 3 . in these regions",
    "@xmath151 is small , which explains the small spectral width of the corresponding photonic bands .    as the eigen - frequencies of the higher order states @xmath166 shift further away from the primary band - gap region , fig .",
    "[ nofx]b , @xmath153 becomes progressively steeper function , leading to the steady increase of the number of `` humps '' in @xmath151 , [ bmrk ] .",
    "such progression accelerates the spacial dependence of amplitude and eventual breakdown of the scale separation approximation used in the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ bogolyubov_phi],[bogolyubov_a ] ) . nevertheless , such loss of applicability occurs well outside of spectral region of interest , demonstrating the robustness of the developed approach .",
    "in this work we studied the optical properties of dual - periodic photonic superlattice with four different theoretical methods .",
    "although each method has its limitations , the results obtained in framework of each model complement each other .    numerical simulation with transfer matrices yields the direct result for the photonic band structure .",
    "this method , however , provides little physical insight into the nature of the photonic bands . in section 3",
    "we compared the spectrum of the infinite ( periodic ) crystal with the transmission spectrum of the finite system with the length equal to one period of the superstructure .",
    "we identified the individual transmission resonances with the photonic bands and found one - to - one correspondence .",
    "furthermore , the spatial distribution of the fields at a resonance demonstrated that in @xmath13 limit the envelope ( amplitude ) of the state changes slowly  on the scale of @xmath8 .    with a method commonly employed in condensed matter physics we investigated the resonant interactions between bloch waves when the second , longer - scale , modulation is introduced .",
    "we showed that flattening of the photonic bands is related to , but goes beyond band folding .",
    "it arises due to the increasing coupling between bloch waves with k - vectors at the boundaries of brillouin zone .",
    "the subsequent increase of the band - gaps regions `` squeezes '' the the bands making them progressively flatter as @xmath167 is increased .",
    "although , as showed in the section 4 , this approach fails for very large @xmath12 , it still provided an insight into the origin of the anomalously small dispersion in spectra of phsc .",
    "diffraction gratings introduced in optical fibers are often spatially modulated .",
    "coupled - mode theory has been developed to reduce the problem to a study of the amplitudes of the forward and backward propagating waves and to avoid the direct solution of maxwell equations .",
    "although the refractive index contrast induced in optical fibers is orders of magnitude smaller then in the systems we are concerned with in this work , cmt - based approach of section 5 provided a clear physical picture .",
    "it showed that the electromagnetic states of our optical resonators can be thought of as the eigen - states of the photonic wells .",
    "this further reinforced the analogy with crows that we developed in section 3 .",
    "we proceeded by noting a formal similarity between the helmholtz equation with the considered dielectric function and the equation describing parametric resonance in oscillation theory . adopting amplitude - phase formalism",
    "accompanied by separation of scales ( short @xmath5 and long @xmath168 ) allowed us to derive to tractable set of equations on the envelope functions .",
    "this enabled the study physically meaningful mode profiles directly , without assuming smallness of modulations of refractive index .",
    "we find that dual - periodic photonic lattice is a promising system for studying slow - light phenomena .",
    "it can be viewed as an array of evanescently - coupled optical cavities .",
    "the cavities are formed due to presence of the second , long - range , modulation which creates alternating spatial regions of allowed and forbidden propagation .",
    "thus , analogies with multiple - quantum - well and coupled resonant optical arrays ( crows ) are appropriate . unlike other crow implementations , the studies structures can be produced with holography - based approach , which enables fabrication of arrays with a large number of identical resonators .",
    "the latter is crucial condition from an experimental point of view .",
    "it should ensure that the resonances of the individual cavities couple to form flat photonic bands .",
