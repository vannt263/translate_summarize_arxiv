    "we begin our walk through the phase diagram at zero baryon number density , with a brief review  @xcite of the phase changes which occur as a function of temperature .",
    "that is , we begin by restricting ourselves to the vertical axis in figures  1 through 4 .",
    "this slice of the phase diagram was explored by the early universe during the first tens of microseconds after the big bang and can be studied in lattice simulations .",
    "as heavy ion collisions are performed at higher and higher energies , they create plasmas with a lower and lower baryon number to entropy ratio and therefore explore regions of the phase diagram closer and closer to the vertical axis .",

    "1 ) the vacuum phase , with hadrons as excitations , is characterized by a chiral condensate @xmath5 .",
    "( the color index @xmath6 is summed over the three colors ; the flavor index @xmath7 is summed over the two flavors . ) whereas the qcd lagrangian is invariant under separate global flavor rotations of the left - handed and right - handed quarks , the presence of the chiral condensate spontaneously breaks @xmath8 to the subgroup @xmath9 , in which only simultaneous flavor rotations of @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks are allowed . in this way , locking left- and right - handed rotations breaks global symmetries and results in three massless goldstone bosons , the pions .",
    "the chiral order parameter , a @xmath12 matrix @xmath13 in flavor space , can be written in terms of four real fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 as @xmath16 where the @xmath17 are the three pauli matrices . @xmath18 and @xmath19 rotations act on @xmath13 from the left and right , respectively .",
    "the order parameter can also be written as a four component scalar field @xmath20 and the @xmath8 rotations are then simply @xmath21 rotations of @xmath22 . in this language ,",
    "the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath23 is described as @xmath24 : in the vacuum , @xmath25 and this condensate picks a direction in @xmath21-space .",
    "the direction in which the condensate points is conventionally taken to be the @xmath14 direction . in the presence of @xmath26 ,",
    "the @xmath15 excitations are excitations of the direction in which @xmath27 is pointing , and are therefore massless goldstone modes .    at nonzero but low temperature , one finds a gas of pions , the analogue of a gas of spin - waves , but @xmath27 is still nonzero .",
    "above some temperature @xmath28 , entropy wins over order ( the direction in which @xmath22 points is scrambled ) and @xmath29 .",
    "the phase transition at which chiral symmetry is restored is likely second order and belongs to the universality class of @xmath21 spin models in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "below @xmath28 , chiral symmetry is broken and there are three massless pions . at @xmath30 , there are four massless degrees of freedom : the pions and the sigma . above @xmath30 , the pion and sigma correlation lengths are degenerate and finite .    in nature ,",
    "the light quarks are not massless . because of this explicit chiral symmetry breaking ,",
    "the second order phase transition is replaced by an analytical crossover : physics changes dramatically but smoothly in the crossover region , and no correlation length diverges .",
    "thus , in figure  2 , there is no sharp boundary on the vertical axis separating the low temperature hadronic world from the high temperature quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this picture is consistent with present lattice simulations  @xcite , which suggest @xmath31  mev  @xcite .",

    "( in section iii , we describe the color superconducting ( 2sc ) phase of cold dense quark matter which occurs at values of @xmath2 above this first order transition ; the fact that this is a transition in which two different condensates compete strengthens the argument that this transition is first order  @xcite . )",
    "this suggests that the phase diagram features a critical point @xmath0 at which the line of first order phase transitions present for @xmath32 ends , as shown in figure  2",
    ". would be a tricritical point  @xcite , at which the first order transition becomes second order .",

    "] at @xmath33 , the phase transition is second order and is in the ising universality class  @xcite . although the pions remain massive , the correlation length in the @xmath14 channel diverges due to universal long wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "this results in characteristic signatures , analogues of critical opalescence in the sense that they are unique to collisions which freeze out near the critical point , which can be used to discover @xmath0  @xcite .    returning to the @xmath34 axis , universal arguments  @xcite , again backed by lattice simulation  @xcite ,",
    "tell us that if the strange quark were as light as the up and down quarks , the transition would be first order , rather than a smooth crossover .",
    "this means that if one could dial the strange quark mass @xmath35 , one would find a critical @xmath36 at which the transition as a function of temperature is second order  @xcite .",
    "figures  2 , 3 and 4 are drawn for a sequence of decreasing strange quark masses .",
    "somewhere between figures  3 and 4 , @xmath35 is decreased below @xmath36 and the transition on the vertical axis becomes first order .",
    "the value of @xmath36 is an open question , but lattice simulations suggest that it is about half the physical strange quark mass  @xcite .",
    "these results are not yet conclusive  @xcite but if they are correct then the phase diagram in nature is as shown in figure  3 , and the phase transition at low @xmath2 is a smooth crossover .",
    "= 2.5 in    [ fig3 ]    = 2.5 in    [ fig4 ]    these observations fit together in a simple and elegant fashion .",
    "if we could vary @xmath35 , we would find that as @xmath35 is reduced from infinity to @xmath36 , the critical point @xmath0 in the @xmath37 plane moves toward the @xmath34 axis  @xcite .",

    "] by dialing @xmath46 and thus @xmath2 , experimenters can find the critical point @xmath0 .",
    "we hope that the study of heavy ion collisions will , in the end , lead both to a quantitative study of the properties of the quark - gluon plasma phase at temperatures well above the transition and to a quantitative understanding of how to draw the phase transition region of the phase diagram . probing the partonic matter created early in the collision relies on a suite of signatures including : the use of @xmath47 mesons , charmed mesons , and perhaps the @xmath48 as probes ; the energy loss of high momentum partons and consequent effects on the high-@xmath49 hadron spectrum ; and the detection of photons and dileptons over and above those emitted in the later hadronic stages of the collision .",
    "i will not review this program here .",
    "instead , i focus on signatures of the critical point .",
    "the map of the qcd phase diagram which i have sketched so far is simple , coherent and consistent with all we know theoretically ; the discovery of the critical point would provide an experimental foundation for the central qualitative feature of the landscape .",
    "this discovery would in addition confirm that in higher energy heavy ion collisions and in the big bang , the qcd phase transition is a smooth crossover .",
    "furthermore , the discovery of collisions which create matter that freezes out near @xmath0 would imply that conditions above the transition existed prior to freezeout , and would thus make it much easier to interpret the results of other experiments which study those observables which can probe the partonic matter created early in the collision .",
    "we theorists must clearly do as much as we can to tell experimentalists _ where _ and _ how _ to find @xmath0 .",
    "the `` where '' question , namely the question of predicting the value of @xmath33 and thus suggesting the @xmath46 to use to find @xmath0 , is much harder for us to answer .",
    "first , as we stress further in the next section , _ ab initio _ analysis of qcd in its full glory  i.e. lattice calculations  are at present impossible at nonzero @xmath2 .",
    "we must therefore rely on models .",
    "second , an intrinsic feature of the picture we have described is that @xmath33 is sensitive to the mass of the strange quark , and therefore particularly hard to predict .",
    "crude models suggest that @xmath33 could be @xmath50  mev in the absence of the strange quark  @xcite ; this in turn suggests that in nature @xmath33 may have of order half this value , and may therefore be accessible at the sps if the sps runs with @xmath51  agev .",
    "however , at present theorists can not predict the value of @xmath33 even to within a factor of two .",
    "the sps can search a significant fraction of the parameter space ; if it does not find @xmath0 , it will then be up to the rhic experiments to map the @xmath52  mev region .",
    "although we are trying to be helpful with the `` where '' question , we are not very good at answering it quantitatively .",
    "this question can only be answered convincingly by an experimental discovery .",
    "what we theorists _ can _ do reasonably well is to answer the `` how '' question , thus enabling experimenters to answer `` where '' .",
    "this is the goal of a recent paper by stephanov , myself and shuryak  @xcite .",
    "the signatures we have proposed are based on the fact that @xmath0 is a genuine thermodynamic singularity at which susceptibilities diverge and the order parameter fluctuates on long wavelengths .",
    "the resulting signatures are _ nonmonotonic _ as a function of @xmath46 : as this control parameter is varied , we should see the signatures strengthen and then weaken again as the critical point is approached and then passed .",
    "the critical point @xmath0 can also be sought by varying control parameters other than @xmath46 .",
    "ion size , centrality selection and rapidity selection can all be varied .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath46 is that we already know ( by comparing results from the ags and sps ) that dialing it changes the freeze out chemical potential @xmath2 , which is the goal in a search for @xmath0 .",
    "the simplest observables we analyze are the event - by - event fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum of the charged particles in an event , @xmath49 , and of the total charged multiplicity in an event , @xmath53 .",
    "we calculate the magnitude of the effects of critical fluctuations on these and other observables , making predictions which , we hope , will allow experiments to find @xmath0 . as a necessary prelude , we analyze the contribution of noncritical thermodynamic fluctuations .",
    "we compare the noncritical fluctuations of an equilibriated resonance gas to the fluctuations measured by na49 at @xmath41  agev  @xcite .",
    "the observed fluctuations are as perfect gaussians as the data statistics allow , as expected for freeze - out from a system in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the data on multiplicity fluctuations show evidence for a nonthermodynamic contribution , which is to be expected since the extensive quantity @xmath53 is sensitive to the initial size of the system and thus to nonthermodynamic effects like variation in impact parameter .",
    "the contribution of such effects to the fluctuations have now been estimated  @xcite ; the combined thermodynamic and nonthermodynamic fluctuations are in satisfactory agreement with the data  @xcite .",
    "the width of the event - by - event distribution of mean @xmath49 is in good agreement with predictions based on noncritical thermodynamic fluctuations .",
    "that is , na49 data are consistent with the hypothesis that almost all the observed event - by - event fluctuation in mean @xmath49 , an intensive quantity , is thermodynamic in origin .",
    "this bodes well for the detectability of systematic changes in thermodynamic fluctuations near @xmath0 .",
    "one analysis described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the ratio of the width of the true event - by - event distribution of the mean @xmath49 to the width of the distribution in a sample of mixed events .",
    "this ratio was called @xmath54 .",
    "na49 has measured @xmath55  @xcite , which is consistent with expectations for noncritical thermodynamic fluctuations ..",
    "bose effects increase @xmath54 by @xmath56 @xcite ; an anticorrelation introduced by energy conservation in a finite system  when one mode fluctuates up it is more likely for other modes to fluctuate down  decreases @xmath54 by @xmath56 @xcite ; two - track resolution also decreases @xmath54 by @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the contributions due to correlations introduced by resonance decays and due to fluctuations in the flow velocity are each much smaller than @xmath57  @xcite . ] critical fluctuations of the @xmath14 field , i.e. the characteristic long wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter near @xmath0 , influence pion momenta via the ( large ) @xmath58 coupling and increase @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the effect is proportional to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the @xmath14-field correlation length of the long - wavelength fluctuations at freezeout  @xcite . if @xmath61 fm ( a reasonable estimate , as we describe below ) the ratio @xmath54 increases by @xmath62 , ten to twenty times the statistical error in the present measurement  @xcite .",
    "this observable is valuable because data on it has been analyzed and presented by na49 , and it can therefore be used to learn that pb+pb collisions at 158  agev do _ not _ freeze out near  @xmath0 . the @xmath63 nonmonotonic variation in @xmath54 as a function of @xmath46 which we predict is easily detectable but is not so large as to make one confident of using this alone as a signature of @xmath0 .    once @xmath0 is located , however , other observables which are more sensitive to critical effects will be more useful .",
    "for example , a @xmath64 , defined using only the softest @xmath65 of the pions in each event , will be much more sensitive to the critical long wavelength fluctuations .",
    "the higher @xmath49 pions are less affected by the @xmath14 fluctuations  @xcite , and these relatively unaffected pions dominate the mean @xmath49 of all the pions in the event .",
    "this is why the increase in @xmath54 near the critical point will be much less than that of @xmath64 .",
    "depending on the details of the cuts used to define it , @xmath64 should be enhanced by many tens of percent in collisions passing near @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite suggests other such observables , and more can surely be found .",
    "the multiplicity of soft pions is an example of an observable which may be used to detect the critical fluctuations without an event - by - event analysis .",
    "the post - freezeout decay of sigma mesons , which are copious and light at freezeout near @xmath0 and which decay subsequently when their mass increases above twice the pion mass , should result in a population of pions with @xmath66 which appears only for freezeout near the critical point  @xcite . if @xmath67 , this population of unusually low momentum pions will be comparable in number to that of the `` direct '' pions ( i.e. those which were pions at freezeout ) and will result in a large signature .",
    "this signature is therefore certainly large for @xmath61  fm and would not increase much further if @xmath60 were larger still .",
    "the variety of observables which should _ all _ vary nonmonotonically with @xmath46 ( and should all peak at the same @xmath46 ) is sufficiently great that if it were to turn out that @xmath68  mev , making @xmath0 inaccessible to the sps , all four rhic experiments could play a role in the study of the critical point .    the purpose of ref .",
    "@xcite is to estimate how large @xmath60 can become , thus making the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite for the magnitude of various signatures more quantitative .",
    "the nonequilibrium dynamics analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite is guaranteed to occur in a heavy ion collision which passes near @xmath0 , even if local thermal equilibrium is achieved at a higher temperature during the earlier evolution of the plasma created in the collision .",
    "if this plasma were to cool arbitrarily slowly , @xmath69 would diverge at @xmath38 .",
    "however , it would take an infinite time for @xmath69 to grow infinitely large .",
    "indeed , near a critical point , the longer the correlation length , the longer the equilibration time , and the slower the correlation length can grow .",
    "this critical slowing down means that the correlation length can not grow sufficiently fast for the system to stay in equilibrium .",
    "we use the theory of dynamical critical phenomena to describe the effects of critical slowing down of the long wavelength dynamics near @xmath0 on the time development of the correlation length .",
    "the correlation length does not have time to grow as large as it would in equilibrium : we find @xmath70 fm for trajectories passing near @xmath0 .",
    "although critical slowing down hinders the growth of @xmath69 , it also slows the decrease of @xmath69 as the system continues to cool below the critical point . as a result",
    ", @xmath69 does not decrease significantly between the phase transition and freezeout .",
    "our results depend on the universal function describing the equilibrium behavior of @xmath69 near the ising critical point @xmath0 , on the universal dynamical exponent @xmath71 describing critical slowing down ( perturbations away from equilibrium relax toward equilibrium on a timescale which scales with @xmath69 like @xmath72  @xcite ) , on the nonuniversal constant @xmath73 , the nonuniversal constants which relate @xmath74 and @xmath75 to dimensionless ising model variables , on @xmath38 which we take to be @xmath76  mev , and finally on the cooling rate @xmath77 which we estimate to be 4 mev / fm  @xcite .    our estimate that @xmath69 does not grow larger than @xmath78 is robust in three senses .",
    "first , it depends very little on the angle with which the trajectory passes through @xmath0 .",
    "second , it turns out to depend on only one combination of all the nonuniversal quantities which play a role .",
    "we call this parameter @xmath7 ; it is proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "third , our results do not depend sensitively on @xmath7 .",
    "we show that the maximum value of @xmath69 scales like @xmath80 @xcite.he  @xcite . ] thus , for example , @xmath77 would have to be a factor of 25 smaller than we estimate in order for @xmath69 to grow to @xmath81 instead of @xmath78 .",
    "although our results are robust in this sense , they can not be treated as precise because our assumption that the dynamics of @xmath69 in qcd is described by the universal classical dynamics of the three - dimensional ising model only becomes precise if @xmath82 , while our central result is that @xmath69 does not grow beyond @xmath83 . a @xmath84-dimensional quantum field theoretical treatment of the interplay between cooling and the dynamics of critical slowing down",
    "is not yet available , but promising first steps in this direction can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a result which is of great importance in the planning of experimental searches is that one need not hit @xmath0 precisely in order to find it .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that if one were to do a scan with collisions at many finely spaced values of the energy and thus @xmath2 , one would see signatures of @xmath0 with approximately the same magnitude over a broad range of @xmath2 .",
    "the magnitude of the signatures will not be narrowly peaked as @xmath2 is varied .",
    "as long as one gets close enough to @xmath0 that the equilibrium correlation length is @xmath85 , the actual correlation length @xmath69 will grow to @xmath83 .",
    "there is no advantage to getting closer to @xmath0 , because critical slowing down prevents @xmath69 from getting much larger even if @xmath86 does .",
    "data at many finely spaced values of @xmath2 is _ not _ called for .    as described above ,",
    "knowing that we are looking for @xmath87  fm allows us @xcite to make quantitative estimates of the magnitude of the signatures of @xmath0 described in detail in ref .",
    "together , the excess multiplicity at low momentum ( due to post - freezeout sigma decays ) and the excess event - by - event fluctuation of the momenta of the low momentum pions ( due to their coupling to the order parameter which is fluctuating with correlation length @xmath60 ) should allow a convincing detection of the critical point @xmath0",
    ". both should behave nonmonotonically as the collision energy , and hence @xmath2 , are varied .",
    "both should peak for those heavy ion collisions which freeze out near @xmath0 , with @xmath61 fm .",
    "we have learned much from the beautiful gaussian event - by - event fluctuations observed by na49 .",
    "the magnitude of these fluctuations are consistent with the hypothesis that the hadronic system at freezeout is in approximate thermal equilibrium .",
    "these and other data show none of the non - gaussian features that would signal that the system had been driven far from equilibrium either by a rapid traversal of the transition region or by the bubbling that would occur near a strong first order phase transition .",
    "there is also no sign of the enhanced , but still gaussian , fluctuations which would signal freezeout near the critical point @xmath0 . combining these observations with the observation of tantalizing indications that the matter created in sps collisions is not well described at early times by hadronic models  @xcite suggests that collisions at the sps may be exploring the crossover region to the left of the critical point @xmath0 , in which the matter is not well - described as a hadron gas but is also not well - described as a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this speculation could be confirmed in two ways .",
    "first , if the sps is probing the crossover region then the coming experiments at rhic may discover direct signatures of an early partonic phase , which are well - described by theoretical calculations beginning from an equilibrated quark - gluon plasma .",
    "second , if @xmath41  agev collisions are probing the crossover region not far to the left of the critical point @xmath0 , then sps data taken at lower energies would result in the discovery of @xmath0 .",
    "if , instead , rhic were to discover @xmath0 with @xmath68  mev , that would indicate that the sps experiments have probed the weakly first order region just to the right of @xmath0 .",
    "regardless , discovering @xmath0 would take all the speculation out of mapping this part of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "i turn now to recent developments in our understanding of the low temperature , high density regions of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "first , a notational confession .",
    "it is conventional in the literature on cold dense quark matter to define @xmath2 as the _ quark _ number chemical potential , @xmath88 the baryon number chemical potential used in sections i and ii . we make this change from here on .",
    "for example , neutron star cores likely have @xmath89  mev , corresponding to baryon number chemical potentials @xmath90  gev in figures  1 - 4 .",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom in cold dense quark matter are those which involve quarks with momenta near the fermi surface . at high density ,",
    "when the fermi momentum is large , the qcd gauge coupling @xmath91 is small .",
    "however , because of the infinite degeneracy among pairs of quarks with equal and opposite momenta at the fermi surface , even an arbitrarily weak attraction between quarks renders the fermi surface unstable to the formation of a condensate of quark cooper pairs . creating a pair costs no free energy at the fermi surface and the attractive interaction results in a free energy benefit .",
    "pairs of quarks can not be color singlets , and in qcd with two flavors of massless quarks the cooper pairs form in the ( attractive ) color @xmath92 channel  @xcite .",
    "the resulting condensate creates a gap @xmath93 at the fermi surfaces of quarks with two out of the three colors and breaks @xmath94 to an @xmath95 subgroup , giving mass to five of the gluons by the anderson - higgs mechanism . in qcd with two flavors ,",
    "the cooper pairs are @xmath96 flavor singlets and the global flavor symmetry @xmath97 is intact .",
    "there is also an unbroken global symmetry which plays the role of @xmath98 .",
    "thus , no global symmetries are broken in this 2sc phase .",
    "there must therefore be a phase transition between the 2sc and hadronic phases on the horizontal axis in figure  1 , at which chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "this phase transition is first order  @xcite since it involves a competition between chiral condensation and diquark condensation  @xcite .",
    "there need be no transition between the 2sc and quark - gluon plasma phases in figure  1 because neither phase breaks any global symmetries .",
    "however , this transition , which is second order in mean field theory , is likely first order in qcd due to gauge field fluctuations  @xcite , at least at high enough density  @xcite .    in qcd with three flavors of massless quarks , the cooper pairs _ can not _ be flavor singlets , and both color and flavor symmetries are necessarily broken .",
    "the symmetries of the phase which results have been analyzed in  @xcite . the attractive channel favored by one - gluon exchange exhibits `` color - flavor locking . ''",
    "a condensate of the form @xmath99 involving left - handed quarks alone , with @xmath6 , @xmath100 color indices and @xmath7 , @xmath101 flavor indices , locks @xmath102 flavor rotations to @xmath94 : the condensate is not symmetric under either alone , but is symmetric under the simultaneous @xmath103 rotations .",
    "channel induces a condensate in the color @xmath104 channel because this breaks no further symmetries  @xcite .",
    "the resulting condensates can be written in terms of @xmath105 and @xmath106 where @xmath107 . here , the kronecker @xmath108 s lock color and flavor rotations",
    ". the pure color @xmath92 condensate ( [ cflform ] ) has @xmath109 . ]",
    "a condensate involving right - handed quarks alone locks @xmath110 flavor rotations to @xmath94 . because color is vectorial , the combined effect of the @xmath111 and @xmath112 condensates is to lock @xmath102 to @xmath110 , breaking chiral symmetry .",
    "@xcite , but this is a small effect  @xcite . ] thus , in quark matter with three massless quarks , the @xmath113 symmetry is broken down to the global diagonal @xmath114 group .",
    "a gauged @xmath115 subgroup of the original symmetry group  a linear combination of one color generator and electromagnetism , which lives within @xmath116  also remains unbroken .",
    "all nine quarks have a gap .",
    "all eight gluons get a mass .",
    "there are nine massless nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "all the quarks , all the massive vector bosons , and all the nambu - goldstone bosons have integer charges under the unbroken gauged @xmath115 symmetry , which therefore plays the role of electromagnetism .",
    "the cfl phase therefore has the same symmetries as baryonic matter with a condensate of cooper pairs of baryons  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many non - universal features of these two phases correspond  @xcite .",
    "this raises the possibility that quark matter and baryonic matter may be continuously connected  @xcite , as shown in figure  4 .",
    "the physics of the cfl phase has been the focus of much recent work  @xcite .",
    "nature chooses two light quarks and one middle - weight strange quark , rather than three degenerate quarks as in figure  4 .",
    "a nonzero @xmath35 weakens those condensates which involve pairing between light and strange quarks .",
    "the cfl phase requires nonzero @xmath117 and @xmath118 condensates ; because these condensates pair quarks with differing fermi momenta they can only exist if they are larger than of order @xmath119 , the difference between the @xmath120 and @xmath121 fermi momenta in the absence of pairing .",
    "if one imagines increasing @xmath35 at fixed @xmath2 , one finds a first order unlocking transition  @xcite : for larger @xmath35 only @xmath120 and @xmath122 quarks pair and the 2sc phase is obtained .",
    "conversely , as @xmath35 is reduced in going from figure  2 to 3 to 4 , the region occupied by the cfl phase expands to encompass regions with smaller and smaller @xmath2  @xcite . for any @xmath123 ,",
    "the cfl phase is the ground state at arbitrarily high density  @xcite . for larger values of @xmath35 , there is a 2sc interlude on the horizontal axis , in which chiral symmetry is restored , before the cfl phase breaks it again at high densities . for smaller values of @xmath35 , the possibility of quark - hadron continuity  @xcite as shown in figure  4 arises .",
    "it should be noted that even when the strange and light quarks are not degenerate , the cfl phase may be continuous with a baryonic phase in which the densities of all the nucleons and hyperons are comparable ; there are , however , phase transitions between this hypernuclear phase and ordinary nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "the nambu - goldstone bosons in the cfl phase are fermi surface excitations in which the orientation of the left - handed and right - handed diquark condensates oscillate out of phase in flavor space .",

    "@xmath135  mev is much larger relative to the fermi momentum ( say @xmath89  mev ) than in low temperature superconductivity in metals .",

    "it is therefore important to look for astrophysical consequences of color superconductivity .",
    "* equation of state : * much of the work on the consequences of quark matter within a compact star has focussed on the effects of quark matter on the equation of state , and hence on the radius of the star . as a fermi surface phenomenon , color superconductivity has little effect on the equation of state : the pressure is an integral over the whole fermi volume .",
    "color superconductivity modifies the equation of state at the @xmath153 level , typically by a few percent  @xcite .",
    "such small effects can be neglected in present calculations , and for this reason i will not attempt to survey the many ways in which observations of neutron stars are being used to constrain the equation of state  @xcite .",

    "this may explain the observation that lmxb frequencies are clustered around 250 - 350  hz  @xcite , which is otherwise puzzling in that it is thought that lmxb s provide the link between canonical pulsars and millisecond pulsars , which have frequencies as large as 600  hz  @xcite",

    "@xcite is to changes in model assumptions and also how its predictions fare when compared to those of other explanations which posit upper bounds on lmxb frequencies  @xcite , rather than a most probable frequency range with no associated upper bound  @xcite .",
    "we note here that because glendenning and weber s effect depends only on the equation of state and not on other properties of quark matter , the fact that the quark matter must in fact be a color superconductor will not affect the results in any significant way .",

    "the specific heat is dominated by that of the electrons , although it may also receive a small contribution from the cfl phase goldstone bosons .",
    "although further work is required , it is already clear that both @xmath155 and @xmath156 are much smaller than in the nuclear matter outside the quark matter core .",
    "this means that the total heat capacity and the total neutrino emission rate ( and hence the cooling rate ) of a neutron star with a cfl core will be determined completely by the nuclear matter outside the core .",
    "the quark matter core is `` inert '' : with its small heat capacity and emission rate it has little influence on the temperature of the star as a whole .",
    "as the rest of the star emits neutrinos and cools , the core cools by conduction , because the electrons keep it in good thermal contact with the rest of the star .",
    "these qualitative expectations are nicely borne out in the calculations presented by page et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the analysis of the cooling history of a neutron star with a quark matter core in the 2sc phase is more complicated . the red and green up and down quarks pair with a gap many orders of magnitude larger than the temperature , which is of order 10 kev , and are therefore inert as described above .",

    "the star will cool rapidly until its interior temperature is @xmath165 , at which time the quark matter core will become inert and the further cooling history will be dominated by neutrino emission from the nuclear matter fraction of the star . if future data were to show that neutron stars first cool rapidly ( direct urca ) and then cool more slowly , such data would allow an estimate of the smallest quark matter gap .",
    "we are unlikely to be so lucky .",
    "the simple observation of rapid cooling would _ not _ be an unambiguous discovery of quark matter with small gaps ; there are other circumstances in which the direct urca processes occurs . however ,",
    "if as data on neutron star temperatures improves in coming years the standard cooling scenario proves correct , indicating the absence of the direct urca processes , this _ would _",
    "rule out the presence of quark matter with gaps in the 10 kev range or smaller .",
    "the presence of a quark matter core in which all gaps are @xmath166 can never be revealed by an analysis of the cooling history .",
    "* supernova neutrinos : * we now turn from neutrino emission from a neutron star which is many years old to that from the protoneutron star during the first seconds of a supernova .",

    "as the core of the protoneutron star cools over the coming seconds , if it contains quark matter this quark matter will cool through @xmath28 , entering the color superconducting regime of the qcd phase diagram from above . for @xmath167 , the specific heat rises and",
    "the cooling slows .",
    "then , as @xmath1 drops further and @xmath93 increases to become greater than @xmath1 , the specific heat drops rapidly .",
    "furthermore , as the number density of quark quasiparticles becomes suppressed by @xmath168 , the neutrino transport mean free path rapidly becomes very long  @xcite .",
    "this means that all the neutrinos previously trapped in the now color superconducting core are able to escape in a sudden burst .",
    "if we are lucky enough that a terrestrial neutrino detector sees thousands of neutrinos from a future supernova , carter and reddy s results suggest that there may be a signature of the transition to color superconductivity present in the time distribution of these neutrinos .",

    "both shear viscosity and bulk viscosity act to damp the r - modes , preventing them from going unstable .",
    "the bulk viscosity and the quark contribution to the shear viscosity both become exponentially small in quark matter with @xmath170 and as a result , as madsen  @xcite has shown , a compact star made _ entirely _ of quark matter with gaps @xmath171  mev or greater is unstable if its spin frequency is greater than tens to 100  hz .",
    "many compact stars spin faster than this , and madsen therefore argues that compact stars can not be strange quark stars unless some quarks remain ungapped .",
    "alas , this powerful argument becomes much less powerful in the context of a neutron star with a quark matter core .",
    "first , the r - mode oscillations have a wave form whose amplitude is largest at large radius , outside the core .",
    "second , in an ordinary neutron star there is a new source of damping : friction at the boundary between the crust and the neutron superfluid `` mantle '' keeps the r - modes stable regardless of the properties of a quark matter core  @xcite .    * magnetic field evolution : * next , we turn to the physics of magnetic fields within color superconducting neutron star cores  @xcite .",

    "a color superconductor behaves differently . at first glance",
    ", it seems that because a diquark cooper pair has nonzero electric charge , a diquark condensate must exhibit the standard meissner effect , expelling ordinary magnetic fields or restricting them to flux tubes within whose cores the condensate vanishes .",
    "this is not the case  @xcite . in both the 2sc and cfl phase a linear combination of the @xmath115 gauge transformation of ordinary electromagnetism and one (",
    "the eighth ) color gauge transformation remains unbroken even in the presence of the condensate .",
    "this means that the ordinary photon @xmath172 and the eighth gluon @xmath173 are replaced by new linear combinations @xmath174 where @xmath175 is massless and @xmath176 is massive .",
    "that is , @xmath177 satisfies the ordinary maxwell equations while @xmath178 experiences a meissner effect .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath179 is the analogue of the weinberg angle in electroweak theory , in which the presence of the higgs condensate causes the @xmath180 and the third @xmath181 gauge boson to mix to form the photon , @xmath172 , and the massive @xmath182 boson .",
    "@xmath183 is proportional to @xmath184 and turns out to be about @xmath185 in the 2sc phase and @xmath186 in the cfl phase  @xcite .",
    "this means that the @xmath187-photon which propagates in color superconducting quark matter is mostly photon with only a small gluon admixture .",
    "if a color superconducting neutron star core is subjected to an ordinary magnetic field , it will either expel the @xmath188 component of the flux or restrict it to flux tubes , but it can ( and does  @xcite ) admit the great majority of the flux in the form of a @xmath177 magnetic field satisfying maxwell s equations . the decay in time of this `` free field '' ( i.e. not in flux tubes )",

    "this means that a quark matter core within a neutron star serves as an `` anchor '' for the magnetic field : whereas in ordinary nuclear matter the magnetic flux tubes can be dragged outward by the neutron superfluid vortices as the star spins down  @xcite , the magnetic flux within the color superconducting core simply can not decay .",
    "even though this distinction is a qualitative one , it will be difficult to confront it with data since what is observed is the total dipole moment of the neutron star .",
    "a color superconducting core anchors those magnetic flux lines which pass through the core , while in a neutron star with no quark matter core the entire internal magnetic field can decay over time . in both cases , however , the total dipole moment can change since the magnetic flux lines which do not pass through the core can move .    * glitches in quark matter :",
    "* the final consequence of color superconductivity we wish to discuss is the possibility that ( some ) glitches may originate within quark matter regions of a compact star  @xcite . in any context",
    "in which color superconductivity arises in nature , it is likely to involve pairing between species of quarks with differing chemical potentials .",
    "if the chemical potential difference is small enough , bcs pairing occurs as we have been discussing .",
    "if the fermi surfaces are too far apart , no pairing between the species is possible .",
    "the transition between the bcs and unpaired states as the splitting between fermi momenta increases has been studied in electron  @xcite and qcd  @xcite superconductors , assuming that no other state intervenes . however",
    ", there is good reason to think that another state can occur .",
    "this is the `` loff '' state , first explored by larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite and fulde and ferrell  @xcite in the context of electron superconductivity in the presence of magnetic impurities .",
    "they found that near the unpairing transition , it is favorable to form a state in which the cooper pairs have nonzero momentum .",
    "this is favored because it gives rise to a region of phase space where each of the two quarks in a pair can be close to its fermi surface , and such pairs can be created at low cost in free energy .",
    "condensates of this sort spontaneously break translational and rotational invariance , leading to gaps which vary periodically in a crystalline pattern .",
    "if in some shell within the quark matter core of a neutron star ( or within a strange quark star ) the quark number densities are such that crystalline color superconductivity arises , rotational vortices may be pinned in this shell , making it a locus for glitch phenomena .",
    "we  @xcite have explored the range of parameters for which crystalline color superconductivity occurs in the qcd phase diagram , upon making various simplifying assumptions .",
    "for example , we focus primarily on a four - fermion interaction with the quantum numbers of single gluon exchange .",
    "also , we only consider pairing between @xmath120 and @xmath122 quarks , with @xmath189 and @xmath190 , whereas we expect a loff state when the difference between the fermi momenta of any two quark flavors is near an unpairing transition .",
    "we find the loff state is favored for values of @xmath191 which satisfy @xmath192 where @xmath193 and @xmath194 in the weak coupling limit in which @xmath195 .",
    "( here , @xmath196 is the 2sc gap that would arise if @xmath191 were zero . )",
    "the loff gap parameter decreases from @xmath197 at @xmath198 ( where there is a first order bcs - loff phase transition ) to zero at @xmath199 ( where there is a second order loff - normal transition ) . except for very close to @xmath200 , the critical temperature above which the loff state melts will be much higher than typical neutron star temperatures . at stronger coupling the loff",
    "gap parameter decreases relative to @xmath196 and the window of @xmath201 within which the loff state is favored shrinks .",
    "the window grows if the interaction is changed to weight electric gluon exchange more heavily than magnetic gluon exchange .",
    "the quark matter which may be present within a compact star will be in the crystalline color superconductor ( loff ) state if @xmath201 is in the requisite range . for a reasonable value of @xmath191 , say 25  mev , this occurs if the gap @xmath196 which characterizes the uniform color superconductor present at smaller values of @xmath191 is about 40  mev .",
    "this is in the middle of the range of present estimates .",
    "both @xmath191 and @xmath196 vary as a function of density and hence as a function of radius in a compact star .",
    "although it is too early to make quantitative predictions , the numbers are such that crystalline color superconducting quark matter may very well occur in a range of radii within a compact star .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to consider the consequences .",
    "many pulsars have been observed to glitch .",
    "glitches are sudden jumps in rotation frequency @xmath169 which may be as large as @xmath202 , but may also be several orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the frequency of observed glitches is statistically consistent with the hypothesis that all radio pulsars experience glitches  @xcite .",
    "glitches are thought to originate from interactions between the rigid crust , somewhat more than a kilometer thick in a typical neutron star , and rotational vortices in the neutron superfluid which are moving ( or trying to move ) outward as the star spins down .",
    "although the models  @xcite differ in important respects , all agree that the fundamental requirements are the presence of rotational vortices in a superfluid and the presence of a rigid structure which impedes the motion of vortices and which encompasses enough of the volume of the pulsar to contribute significantly to the total moment of inertia .",
    "although it is premature to draw quantitative conclusions , it is interesting to speculate that some glitches may originate deep within a pulsar which features a quark matter core , in a region of that core in which the color superconducting quark matter is in a loff crystalline color superconductor phase .",
    "a three flavor analysis is required to determine whether the loff phase is a superfluid .",
    "if the only pairing is between @xmath120 and @xmath122 quarks , this 2sc phase is not a superfluid  @xcite , whereas if all three quarks pair in some way , a superfluid _ is _",
    "obtained  @xcite .",
    "henceforth , we suppose that the loff phase is a superfluid , which means that if it occurs within a pulsar it will be threaded by an array of rotational vortices .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that these vortices will be pinned in a loff crystal , in which the diquark condensate varies periodically in space . indeed ,",
    "one of the suggestions for how to look for a loff phase in terrestrial electron superconductors relies on the fact that the pinning of magnetic flux tubes ( which , like the rotational vortices of interest to us , have normal cores ) is expected to be much stronger in a loff phase than in a uniform bcs superconductor  @xcite .",
    "a real calculation of the pinning force experienced by a vortex in a crystalline color superconductor must await the determination of the crystal structure of the loff phase .",
    "we can , however , attempt an order of magnitude estimate along the same lines as that done by anderson and itoh  @xcite for neutron vortices in the inner crust of a neutron star . in that context , this estimate has since been made quantitative  @xcite .",
    "for one specific choice of parameters  @xcite , the loff phase is favored over the normal phase by a free energy @xmath203 and the spacing between nodes in the loff crystal is @xmath204 fm .",
    "the thickness of a rotational vortex is given by the correlation length @xmath205 fm .",
    "the pinning energy is the difference between the energy of a section of vortex of length @xmath101 which is centered on a node of the loff crystal vs. one which is centered on a maximum of the loff crystal .",
    "it is of order @xmath206 .",
    "the resulting pinning force per unit length of vortex is of order @xmath207 .",
    "a complete calculation will be challenging because @xmath208 , and is likely to yield an @xmath209 which is somewhat less than that we have obtained by dimensional analysis .",
    "note that our estimate of @xmath209 is quite uncertain both because it is only based on dimensional analysis and because the values of @xmath93 , @xmath101 and @xmath210 are uncertain .",
    "( we hae a good understanding of all the ratios @xmath211 , @xmath201 , @xmath212 and consequently @xmath213 in the loff phase .",
    "it is of course the value of the bcs gap @xmath196 which is uncertain . )",
    "it is premature to compare our crude result to the results of serious calculations of the pinning of crustal neutron vortices as in refs .",
    "it is nevertheless remarkable that they prove to be similar : the pinning energy of neutron vortices in the inner crust is @xmath214 and the pinning force per unit length is @xmath215 . perhaps , therefore , glitches occurring in a region of crystalline color superconducting quark matter may yield similar phenomenology to those occurring in the inner crust .",
    "perhaps the most interesting consequence of these speculations arises in the context of compact stars made entirely of strange quark matter .",
    "the work of witten  @xcite and farhi and jaffe  @xcite raised the possibility that strange quark matter may be energetically stable relative to nuclear matter even at zero pressure .",
    "if this is the case it raises the question whether observed compact stars  pulsars , for example  are strange quark stars  @xcite rather than neutron stars .",
    "a conventional neutron star may feature a core made of strange quark matter , as we have been discussing above .",
    "strange quark stars , on the other hand , are made ( almost ) entirely of quark matter with either no hadronic matter content at all or with a thin crust , of order one hundred meters thick , which contains no neutron superfluid  @xcite .",
    "the nuclei in this thin crust are supported above the quark matter by electrostatic forces ; these forces can not support a neutron fluid .",
    "because of the absence of superfluid neutrons , and because of the thinness of the crust , no successful models of glitches in the crust of a strange quark star have been proposed . since pulsars are observed to glitch , the apparent lack of a glitch mechanism for strange quark stars has been the strongest argument that pulsars can not be strange quark stars  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion must now be revisited .",
    "madsen s conclusion  @xcite that a strange quark star is prone to r - mode instability due to the absence of damping must also be revisited , since the relevant fluid oscillations may be damped within or at the boundary of a region of crystalline color superconductor .",
    "the quark matter in a strange quark star , should one exist , would be a color superconductor .",
    "depending on the mass of the star , the quark number densities increase by a factor of about two to ten in going from the surface to the center  @xcite .",
    "this means that the chemical potential differences among the three quarks will vary also , and there could be a range of radii within which the quark matter is in a crystalline color superconductor phase .",
    "this raises the possibility of glitches in strange quark stars .",
    "because the variation in density with radius is gradual , if a shell of loff quark matter exists it need not be particularly thin . and ,",
    "we have seen , the pinning forces may be comparable in magnitude to those in the inner crust of a conventional neutron star .",
    "it has recently been suggested ( for reasons unrelated to our considerations ) that certain accreting compact stars may be strange quark stars  @xcite , although the evidence is far from unambiguous  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , it has been thought that , because they glitch , conventional radio pulsars can not be strange quark stars .",
    "our work questions this assertion by raising the possibility that glitches may originate within a layer of quark matter which is in a crystalline color superconducting state .",
    "* closing remarks : * the answer to the question of whether the qcd phase diagram does or does not feature a 2sc interlude on the horizontal axis , separating the cfl and baryonic phases in both of which chiral symmetry is broken , depends on whether the strange quark is effectively heavy or effectively light .",
    "this is the central outstanding qualitative question about the high density region of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "a central question at higher temperatures , namely where does nature locate the critical point @xmath0 , also depends on the strange quark mass .",
    "both questions are hard to answer theoretically with any confidence .",
    "the high temperature region is in better shape , however , because the program of experimentation described in section ii allows heavy ion collision experiments to search for the critical point @xmath0 .",
    "theorists have described how to use phenomena characteristic of freezeout in its vicinity to discover @xmath0 ; this gives experimentalists the ability to locate it convincingly .",
    "the discovery of @xmath0 would allow us to draw the higher temperature regions of the map of the qcd phase diagram in ink . at high density , there has been much recent progress in our understanding of how the presence of color superconducting quark matter in a compact star would affect five different phenomena : cooling by neutrino emission , the temporal pattern of the neutrinos emitted by a supernova , the evolution of neutron star magnetic fields , r - mode instabilities , and glitches .",
    "nevertheless , much theoretical work remains to be done before we can make sharp proposals for which astrophysical observations are most likely to help teach us how to ink in the boundaries of the 2sc and cfl regions in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "best of all , though , and as in heavy ion physics , a wealth of new data is expected over the next few years .",
