    "broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos comprise @xmath1% of the qso population in current magnitude - limited samples .",
    "the standard view is that the bal clouds have a small covering factor as seen from the qso nucleus , implying that essentially all radio - quiet qsos would be classified as bal qsos if observed from the proper angle .",
    "an even rarer class comprising only @xmath2 of all radio - quiet qsos in optically - selected samples , the low - ionization bal ( hereafter lo - bal ) qsos , pose serious problems to orientation - based models .",
    "lo - bal qsos have considerably different broad emission line properties , are substantially redder than non - bal qsos , and are intrinsically x - ray quiet ( weymann et al . 1991 ; sprayberry & foltz 1992 ; green 2001 ) .",
    "in addition , the radio properties of lo - bal qsos may indicate that no preferred viewing orientation is necessary to observe bal systems in the spectra of quasars since bals are present in both flat and steep spectrum quasars , _",
    "i.e. , _ objects that are presumably viewed along the jet axis and at high inclination respectively ( brotherton 2001 ; becker et al .",
    "2000 ; gregg et al .",
    "thus lo - bal qsos are thought to constitute a different class of qsos , having more absorbing material and more dust ( voit et al .",
    "1993 ; hutsmekers et al .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that the lo - bal phenomenon may represent a stage in the early life of qsos , either in the form of young qsos `` in the act of casting off their cocoons of gas and dust '' ( voit et al . 1993 ; see also egami et al .",
    "1996 , and hazard et al .",
    "1984 ) , or as the result of outflows driven by supermassive starbursts ( lpari 1994 ; shields 1996 ) .",
    "we have carried out deep keck spectroscopic observations of the host galaxies of the four lo - bal qsos that are currently known at @xmath0 : pg1700 + 518 ( canalizo & stockton 1997 ) , mrk231 and iras07598 + 6508 ( canalizo & stockton 2000 ) , and iras14026 + 4341 ( canalizo & stockton 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "these objects have nuclear properties that are relatively rare in the classical qso population ( _ e.g. , _ boroson & meyers 1992 ; turnshek et al . 1997 ) : ( 1 ) strong feii emission , with the flux ratio feii @xmath3/h@xmath4 @xmath5 1 , and ( 2 ) very weak or no [ oiii ] emission ( see table 1 ) .",
    "in addition , we have found the following properties in the low redshift sample : ( 3 ) every lo - bal qso resides in an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulig ; _ i.e. , _ log @xmath6 ) ; ( 4 ) they have a small range in far infrared ( fir ) colors , intermediate between those characteristic of uligs and qsos ; ( 5 ) the host galaxies show signs of strong tidal interaction , and they appear to be major mergers ( fig .",
    "1 ) ; ( 6 ) spectra of their host galaxies ( fig .",
    "2 ) show unambiguous interaction - induced star formation , with post - starburst ages @xmath7 myr .",

    "thus , it is clear that there has been a recent flow of gas towards the central regions which fueled the centrally concentrated starbursts in each of these objects .",
    "moreover , there is strong evidence that these qsos have been recently fueled ( either for the first time , or simply rejuvenated ) . in agreement with this scenario , mathur et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find that the x - ray flux of the lo - bal qso phl 5200 is highly absorbed with a very steep power - law slope of @xmath17 ( compared to the mean slope for non - bal qsos of @xmath18 )",
    ". such a steep slope may be the result of a high accretion rate close to the eddington limit , which may in turn be indicative of a recent fueling of the black hole ( _ i.e. , _ a young qso ) .",
    "our results support those interpretations of the lo - bal phenomenon which imply young systems . here",
    "we propose a model that accounts for the observed properties in the four low - redshift lo - bal qsos . a major merger between galaxies of similar mass triggers intense bursts of star formation .",
    "as the gas concentrates in nuclear regions , the qso activity is ignited .",
    "along with the gas , dust is concentrated in the central 1 or 2 kpc , resulting in a dust - enshrouded qso .",
    "the dust cocoon shields the narrow line region from the ionizing radiation coming from the central continuum source .",
    "the resulting low ionization parameter and the dusty environment increases the relative prominence of feii emission .",
    "a lo - bal phase comes next , consisting of widespread outflows whereby the qso expels the shroud of gas and dust ( e.g. voit , weymann , & korista 1993 ) . as the ionizing photons are able to escape through holes on the cocoon poked by the outflows , nuclear and extended [ oiii ] appear .",
    "a cocoon with holes may explain the different lightpaths in some bal qsos inferred from polarimetric studies , where some continuum is seen to escape without passing through dust ( e.g. hines & wills 1995 ) .",
    "powerful qsos , especially powerful radio sources , are able to break through the dust cocoon more rapidly , and this is why we do not see many strong radio - loud quasars in cocoon phase ( canalizo & stockton 2001 ; gregg et al .",
    "what keeps the evidence from having more weight is the fact that the sample of lo - bal qsos at @xmath0 is incomplete and may be significantly biased .",
    "only a fraction of low - redshift qsos have been observed in the uv ( where the bal features are evident ) , and these observations have different biases .",
    "for example , turnshek et al . (",
    "1997 ) conducted an hst fos survey of low - z bals in a sample of qsos with weak [ oiii ] ( and strong feii ) .",
    "these two properties have an unusually high incidence in young ir - loud qsos ( canalizo & stockton 2001 ) . the turnshek et al .",
    "sample may then be biased towards young objects .",
    "we are therefore obtaining further spectroscopic and high resolution imaging observations of the host galaxies of bal qsos at somewhat higher redshifts ( for which the bal features appear in the optical ) .",
    "the possibility that the lo - bal phenomenon represents a short phase in the early life of qsos is of great interest because it could potentially provide a method to answer one of the fundamental questions regarding qsos , namely , how long does the qso activity last ? determining the ages of starbursts that are related to the fueling of qsos in a sample of objects could place limits on the duration of the bal phase .",
    "this , along with an estimate of the fraction of qsos go through a lo - bal phase ( as seen from our line of sight ) would place upper limits on the mean lifetime of the qso activity .",
