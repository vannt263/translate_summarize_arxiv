    "the search for new exotic quantum states @xcite are among the most fundamental issues in current condensed matter physics .",
    "these topics have drawn enormous interest for ultracold atomic gases @xcite enabling simulations of many condensed matter phenomena . with a recent experimental progress in synthetic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) for degenerate atomic gases @xcite , diverse new quantum phases due to the soc",
    "have been predicted @xcite , such as the stripe phase and vortex structure in the ground states of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , as well as the rashba pairing bound states ( rashbons ) @xcite and topological superfluidity @xcite in degenerate fermi gases .",
    "the synthetic soc has been successfully implemented and explored by raman coupling of a pair of atomic hyperfine ground states accompanied by a recoil @xcite .",
    "this provides the soc along the recoil direction representing the one - dimension ( 1d ) soc .",
    "the realization of the synthetic soc for ultracold atoms in two or more dimensions is very desirable .",
    "the two dimensional soc of the rashba type has a non - trivial dispersion .",
    "the lower dispersion branch contains a highly degenerate ground state ( the rashba ring ) .",
    "additionally , there is a dirac cone at an intersection point of two dispersion branches , and a band gap can be opened by adding a zeeman term .",
    "this is essential for the topological superfluidity .",
    "recently , a number of elaborate schemes has been suggested to create an effective two- and three - dimensional ( 2d and 3d ) soc @xcite . subsequently",
    "the 2d soc has been experimentally implemented @xcite by inducing the raman transitions between three atomic hyperfine ground states in a ring coupling scheme @xcite , as well as by using another approach which relies on optical lattices @xcite .",
    "however in the experiments @xcite one of the three atomic states belongs to a higher hyperfine manifold leading to losses .",
    "recently su et al @xcite put forward a scheme for generating the effective rashba soc for a two - component atomic bec confined in a bilayer geometry .",
    "the layer index provides an extra degree of freedom to form a basis of four combined spin - layer states composed of two spin and two layer states .",
    "the four spin - layer states are coupled in a cyclic manner by means of the spin flip raman transitions @xcite and the laser - assisted interlay coupling @xcite , both processes being accompanied by recoil .",
    "this provides effectively a ring coupling scheme@xcite leading to the rashba - type soc .",
    "in contrast to the original ring coupling scheme @xcite involving four atomic internal states , the bilayer setup makes use of only two atomic spin states@xcite , like the nist scheme for the one - dimensional ( 1d ) soc @xcite . hence there is no need to employ spin states belonging to a higher hyperfine manifold which suffers from a collisional population decay undermining the effective soc .",
    "therefore , the bilayer scheme offers a more feasible system to study the many - body physics due to 2d soc .",
    "topological superfluidity has attracted an enormous interest in so coupled fermion gases @xcite .",
    "these works considered a pure 2d or 3d rashba - type soc for ultracold atoms with two internal ( spin up and down ) states .",
    "however , in a realistic atomic system the soc is produced in an effective manner by laser dressing of a number of atomic internal states and restricting atomic motion to a manifold of a two fold degenerate dressed states . as a result ,",
    "the topological superfluidity is more involved , an issue which has been little investigated .    here",
    ", we explore the topologic superfluidity of a fermi gas affected by the soc .",
    "the soc is produced using the bilayer scheme previously considered for bosonic atoms @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of the bilayer system is that the interaction takes place mostly between atoms belonging to the same layer @xcite .",
    "therefore the atom - atom interactions differ considerably from the ones featured in the soc scheme involving four cyclically coupled atomic internal states @xcite . in the latter situation",
    "the atoms in all four internal states interact with approximately the same strength .",
    "we find that the bilayer scheme provides an intriguing phase transition of superfluidity . in the regimes of small and moderate atom - light coupling",
    "the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) states emerge .",
    "the fflo states involve pairing with a finite centre - of - mass momentum .",
    "these states have received a considerable attention in different physical contexts @xcite . in general",
    ", the fflo state arises in the spin - polarized systems or can be induced by in - plane zeeman fields in the so coupled fermi gases @xcite . here",
    "we show that for the small to moderate atom - light coupling the fflo states emerge intrinsically in the bilayer system without any external magnetic field or spin polarization . as the atom - light coupling increases",
    ", the system can undergo a transition from the fflo state to the topological superfluid ( tsf ) .",
