    "since 1969 , lunar laser ranging ( llr ) has provided high - precision measurements of the earth - moon distance , contributing to the foundations of our knowledge in gravitation and planetary physics . while being the most evident force of nature , gravity is in fact the weakest of the fundamental forces , and consequently the most poorly tested by modern experiments .",
    "einstein s general relativity  currently our best description of gravity  is fundamentally incompatible with quantum mechanics and is likely to be replaced by a more complete theory in the future .",
    "a modified theory would , for example , predict small deviations in the solar system that , if seen , could have profound consequences for understanding the universe as a whole .    utilizing reflectors placed on the lunar surface by american astronauts and soviet rovers , llr measures the round - trip travel time of short pulses of laser light directed to one reflector at a time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : apollo ] ) . by mapping the shape of the lunar orbit ,",
    "llr is able to distinguish between competing theories of gravity .",
    "range precision has improved from a few decimeters initially to a few millimeters recently , constituting a relative precision of @xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "leveraging the raw measurement across the earth - sun distance provides another two orders of magnitude for gauging relativistic effects in the earth - moon - sun system .",
    ", height=288 ]    as llr precision has improved over time , the technique has remained at the cutting edge of tests of gravitational phenomenology and probes of the lunar interior , and has informed our knowledge of earth orientation , precession , and coordinate systems .",
    "llr was last reviewed in this series in 1982 @xcite ; this update describes the key science drivers and findings of llr , the apparatus and technologies involved , the requisite modeling techniques , and future prospects on all fronts .",
    "llr is expected to continue on its trajectory of improvement , maintaining a leading role in contributions to science .",
    "other recent reviews by merkowitz ( 2010 ) @xcite and by m \" uller et al .",
    "( 2012 ) @xcite complement the present one .",
    "the merkowitz review , like this one , stresses gravitational tests of llr , but with greater emphasis on associated range signals .",
    "next - generation reflector and transponder technologies are more thoroughly covered .",
    "the m \" uller et al .",
    "review ( for which this author is a co - author ) offers a more complete history of llr , has statistics on the llr data set , and provides greater emphasis on geophysics , selenophysics , and coordinate systems .",
    "this review is organized as follows : section  [ sec : the - llr - concept ] provides an overview of the subject ; section[sec : science - from - llr ] reviews the science delivered by llr , with an emphasis on gravitation ; section  [ sec : llr - capability ] describes current llr capabilities ; section  [ sec : recent - surprises ] relates recent surprises from llr , including the finding of the lost lunokhod  1 reflector and evidence for dust accumulation on the reflectors ; section  [ sec : the - modeling - challenge ] treats the modeling challenges associated with millimeter - level llr accuracy ; and section  [ sec : future - advances ] offers possible future directions for the practice of llr . an appendix contains a list of acronyms used in the text .",
    "some single - use ancillary acronyms are only defined in the appendix in order to minimize unimportant interruptions .",
    "a detailed description of the science capabilities of llr is deferred until section  [ sec : science - from - llr ] .",
    "for the purposes of introducing the motivation behind the effort , llr provides the following leading tests and measurements :    * the strong equivalence principle to @xmath2 sensitivity @xcite ; * time - rate - of - change of the gravitational constant to @xmath3 yr@xmath4 @xcite ; * geodetic precession within 0.3% of general relativity prediction @xcite ; * gravitomagnetism within @xmath5% of general relativity prediction @xcite ; * the @xmath6 law to @xmath7 times the strength of gravity at @xmath8  m scales @xcite ; * the presence of a liquid core in the moon having a radius of @xmath9  km @xcite .",
    "llr also provides checks on preferred frame effects @xcite , and newton s third law @xcite .",
    "llr may additionally open a window into the possible existence of extra dimensions via cosmological dilution of gravity @xcite .",
    "besides the strong equivalence principle , llr tests the weak equivalence principle at the level of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "laboratory tests of the weak equivalence principle reach similar levels @xcite , but result in more incisive tests by having the freedom to choose more optimal mass pairs than the iron - silicate pairing dictated by the earth - moon system .",
    "finally , llr is used to define coordinate systems , probe the lunar interior , and study geodynamics @xcite .",
    "order - of - magnitude advances in each of these domains is possible as the llr technique improves from the centimeter to the millimeter regime .      by way of introduction ,",
    "this section presents representative numbers meant to portray key aspects of the llr technique .",
    "some items will enter in subsequent discussion , while others appear only here for the sake of overall familiarity .    while the semi - major axis of the lunar orbit is 384,402  km ,",
    "the time - averaged distance between earth and moon centers is 385,000.6  km , corresponding to 2.56  s of round - trip light travel time .",
    "the range varies from 356,500406,700  km , chiefly due to a 21,000  km amplitude oscillation ( 27.55  d period ) associated with the elliptical orbit of the moon ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "other leading oscillations appear at 3700  km ( 31.8  d ) and 2955  km ( 14.76  d ) due to solar perturbations .",
    "the range rate between earth and moon centers may be as large as 75  m  s@xmath4 , while earth rotation is the dominant range - rate effect , measuring 465  m  s@xmath4 at the equator .",
    "the basic arrangement for performing lunar laser ranging is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : basics ] . illuminating the reflectors sufficiently is a principal challenge in llr .",
    "even a one - arcsecond ( 5  @xmath12rad ) beam  limited by atmospheric turbulence  spreads to 1.9  km at the lunar surface .",
    "this translates into a one - in-25-million chance of a photon launched from earth finding the apollo  11 reflector , for instance ( discussed in section  [ sub : reflectors - and - divergence ] ) .",
    "the return journey is even more difficult , owing to diffractive spread from the corner cube prisms , compounded by velocity aberration .",
    "a 1  m circular aperture on earth can expect to receive one photon out of every 250 million emerging from the apollo reflector .",
    "the tangential relative motion of the earth station with respect to the moon introduces a 46  @xmath12rad velocity aberration , translating to a @xmath13  km offset of the return pattern on the earth s surface and a further reduction of the apollo reflector signal by a factor of 0.60.8 .",
    ", width=480 ]    a useful conversion to memorize is that 1  mm of separation translates into 6.67  ps of round - trip travel time , or inversely 1  ns of round - trip time maps to 0.15  m of one - way distance .",
    "we now review the instruments on the moon and the requirements they impose on the ground apparatus .",
    "example performance is also presented in section  [ sub : apollo - apparatus ] .",
    "llr relies on a total of five passive reflectors left on the surface of the moon roughly 40 years ago ( fig .",
    "[ fig : locations ] ) . the apollo arrays  landed on the apollo  11 , apollo  14 , and apollo  15 missions ",
    "consist of , respectively , 100 , 100 , and 300 3.8  cm diameter fused silica corner cube reflectors employing total internal reflection .",
    "the luna  17 and luna  21 soviet missions to the moon landed the lunokhod  1 and lunokhod  2 rovers , each carrying identical reflector arrays built by the french .",
    "these arrays consist of 14 corner cubes each having a triangular edge length of 11  cm and silvered rear surfaces .",
    "the nominal response of the lunokhod arrays falls between that of the 100-element and 300-element apollo arrays .",
    "pictures of both types of arrays appear in fig .",

    "is the lunokhod reflector design ( courtesy the lavochkin association).[fig : reflectors],title=\"fig:\",height=240 ]    lunar libration changes the apparent tilt of the reflectors with respect to the earth - moon line of sight , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : librations ] filling out a rectangle spanning @xmath14 in longitude and @xmath15 in latitude  not including the earth topocentric correction , which can modify effective libration by as much as a degree .",
    "the median total libration is @xmath16 , and can be in excess of @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : libration - histogram ] ) , again ignoring topocentric considerations . as a result ,",
    "the return pulse acquires a temporal spread due to the fact that some corner cube reflectors are closer to the observer , while others are farther . for the apollo  15 array",
    ", the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) can approach 1  ns ( 150  mm one - way ) , or a root - mean - square ( rms ) in excess of 300  ps .",
    "a typical case of 200  ps rms corresponds to 30  mm of one - way distance , and thus requires 900 measurements ( photons ) in order to achieve a statistical uncertainty in the neighborhood of 1  mm .",
    "thus precision llr demands hundreds or thousands of photons in order to overcome the libration / reflector - imposed measurement uncertainty .",
    "the signal loss in the two - way laser link is staggeringly high , generally amounting to a loss factor in the neighborhood of @xmath18 .",
    "beam divergence on both the up - leg and down - leg result in a signal strength that depends on the inverse - fourth power of distance .",
    "the up - leg divergence is limited by atmospheric turbulence ( seeing ) , so that one may not generally expect better than about 1  arcsec ( 5  @xmath12rad ) divergence , translating to about @xmath19 throughput onto the smaller apollo  11 and 14 arrays .",
    "the down - leg divergence is set by diffraction from the corner cubes .",
    "total internal reflection corner cubes like those used for apollo produce a central irradiance that is 0.15 times that of a simplistic top - hat illumination pattern of angular diameter @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the wavelength and @xmath22 is the corner cube diameter .",
    "the result is that a 1  m circular aperture on earth receives about @xmath23 of the flux incident on the reflector at a wavelength of 532  nm .",
    "the net throughput is then @xmath24 for a 1  m aperture , scaling as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the aperture diameter .",
    "multiplying by typical optical system and atmospheric throughputs ( traversed twice ) , together with filter transmissions and detection efficiencies , total throughput tends to be in the range of @xmath27 .",
    "an energetic pulse of laser light having a pulse width in the neighborhood of 100  ps might be 100  mj , containing @xmath28 photons at green wavelengths .",
    "the result is that llr invariably operates in the single - photon detection regime .",
    "the ground apparatus therefore benefits from having :    * a powerful laser , typically a few watts , with substantial pulse energy ; * sub - arcsecond intrinsic divergence , meaning a launch beam diameter exceeding 10  cm ; * sub - arcsecond pointing and tracking capability ; * a large collection aperture for the return ; * aggressive filtering in the temporal , spatial , and wavelength domains .",
    "additionally , the laser pulsewidth should be @xmath29  ps so that it does not compete with the reflector - induced spread in the overall error budget .",
    "many of the requirements are naturally satisfied by using an astronomical telescope as both the launch and receive instrument in a so - called mono - static arrangement .",
    "for perspective , a 1  w laser limited to 1  arcsec divergence by the atmosphere will return approximately @xmath30  w  m@xmath31 to the ground , translating to a 19@xmath32 magnitude source viewed through a 100  nm wide broadband filter .",
    "meanwhile , the full moon reaches @xmath33  mag , or about @xmath34 times brighter .",
    "more fairly , the surface brightness of the full moon is about 3  mag  arcsec@xmath31 , so that an aperture ( spatial filter ) spanning four square arcseconds admits @xmath35 times more background than signal , or a signal - to - background ratio ( sbr ) around @xmath36 .",
    "a wavelength filter having a 1  nm passband increases the sbr to @xmath37 , and temporal filtering at the 1  ns level compared to a 50  ms repetition rate ( 20  hz ) carries a factor of @xmath38 for a net sbr@xmath39 .",
    "clearly , the temporal filter is the most effective of the three .",
    "missing from this discussion is the apparent degradation of the lunar reflector response @xcite , reduced by a factor of ten across the board , and an additional factor of ten at full moon ( discussed in section  [ sub : reflector - degradation ] ) .",
    "an example return from apollo  15 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a15-run ] , demonstrating the effect of libration as well as the high sbr recently achieved in llr measurements .",
    "a histogram of the same data is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : a15-hists ] , in which it is seen that the temporal width of the lunar return is almost completely determined by the libration - induced reflector spread .",
    "details on the apparatus used to acquire these data can be found in section  [ sub : apollo - apparatus ] .",
    "it is important to understand the fundamental measurement performed by llr .",
    "after a brief description in this section , a more detailed treatment may be found in section  [ sub : model - content / construction ] .",
    "a stable clock provides a frequency reference by which time intervals may be precisely measured .",
    "time transfer techniques  usually via the global positioning system ( gps)guarantee long - term frequency stability and synchronization with atomic clock ensembles around the globe .",
    "the core measurement consists of recording two event times  corresponding to photon launch and detection  against the local clock .",
    "the launch time is generally gauged by measuring the return from a local corner cube mounted at the telescope exit aperture , heavily attenuated to the single - photon level so that the same detector and timing system may be used for both the local ( fiducial ) and remote ( lunar ) photon returns .",
    "a constant offset between the earth - fixed axis intersection of the telescope and fiducial corner cube is added to each range measurement . in order to achieve millimeter - level precision , the _ absolute",
    "_ time only needs to be accurate at the microsecond level ( earth rotation modifies the earth - moon distance by @xmath40  mm in 1  @xmath12s ) , while the _ relative _ time must be understood at the few - picosecond level .",
    "the latter requirement translates to frequency stability at the @xmath41 level over the course of a few seconds .    because all massive solar system bodies influence the earth - moon range , the analysis is most conveniently performed in the solar system barycenter ( ssb ) frame .",
    "the measured times are transformed into ssb coordinates using standard time transformation techniques  as outlined , for example , by moyer ( 1981 ) @xcite  primarily consisting of adjustments to account for velocity - induced time dilation and gravitational redshift resulting from the solar potential .",
    "accounting for body figures and rotation of earth and moon ( and the solar @xmath42 ) , a fully relativistic ( einstein - infeld - hoffmann : eih ) equation of motion is numerically integrated , varying input parameters  chiefly initial conditions  to search for dynamical world - lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : world - lines ] ) of the relevant bodies that satisfy the round - trip light propagation measurements in the ssb frame .",
    "parameters in the relativistic model allowing departures from the specific prescription of general relativity ( gr ) indicate deviations from gr .",
    "the technique is more fully described in williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) @xcite and m \" uller et al .",
    "( 2008 ) @xcite .",
    "simultaneous numerical integration of lunar rotation is critical for computing consistent dynamics , and will be treated further in section  [ sub : the - lunar - interior ] .",
    "here we present a more comprehensive account of the science delivered by llr than was introduced in section  [ sub : current - science - results ] .",
    "first , we look at gravitation , including the equivalence principle , time - rate - of - change of newton s @xmath43 , gravitomagnetism , geodetic precession , and the inverse - square law .",
    "next , we briefly address the lunar interior and geophysical concerns .      the concordance of astrophysical measurements in the last 15 years  the anisotropy scale of the cosmic microwave background @xcite , the distance measurements of type  ia supernovae @xcite , the gravitational behaviors of galactic superclusters @xcite , and the power spectrum of large - scale structure @xcite  point to the surprising conclusion that the expansion of the universe is _ accelerating _ , implying some form of a _ fundamentally new _ gravitational phenomenon",
    ". the cosmological acceleration could be due to a scalar field that produces effects similar to those associated with the `` cosmological constant , '' originally introduced into the relativistic field equations by einstein .",
    "a scalar field would likely couple to the gravitational field in such a way as to produce a departure from the equivalence principle ( ep ) @xcite , and would introduce time variations in the fundamental coupling constants of nature @xcite .",
    "ep and @xmath44 tests therefore have discovery potential with a very broad reach , and in fact provide some of the most sensitive low - energy probes for new physics . in light of recent discoveries ,",
    "it is important that scientific inquiry is not restricted to current theoretical expectations , but rather that every available avenue for testing the nature of gravity is examined .",
    "the lunar orbit offers a pristine laboratory for testing gravity , as non - gravitational effects on the orbit begin to show up only at the millimeter level .",
    "moreover , the moon is far enough from the earth to be dominated by solar gravity , so that the earth and moon may each be considered to be in _ solar _ orbits .",
    "this fact makes the earth - moon - sun system useful as a probe of the equivalence principle ( and other relativistic phenomena ) at scales of 1  au  extending the baseline against which to compare the raw measurement precision .",
    "we highlight here some of the contributions to gravitational physics from llr .",
    "the list is not complete , but provides a sense of the cornerstone capabilities .",
    "most of these science results are based on modeling that currently produces post - fit residuals of measured data in the neighborhood of 2  cm , so that millimeter - quality data could in principle improve current limits by an order of magnitude given commensurate improvements in modeling ( see section  [ sec : the - modeling - challenge ] ) .",
    "the simplest prediction of einstein s equivalence principle ",
    "the universality of free - fall  is one of the most precisely tested principles in all of physics .",
    "yet there are strong motivations for extending the tests and pushing their precisions even higher .",
    "the ep can be decomposed into two key forms .",
    "the weak form of the ep ( wep ) applies to the gravitational properties of all forms of mass - energy except for gravity , while the strong ep ( sep ) extends the wep to include gravity itself .",
    "the earth - moon - sun system is currently the _ best available _ probe of the sep , first pointed out by nordtvedt @xcite . from the vantage point of the ep ,",
    "the earth and moon are test bodies that differ in two important ways .",
    "first , the earth s mass has a fractional contribution from gravitational self - energy ( @xmath45 ) that is about 20 times greater than the corresponding measure for the moon  allowing llr to test the sep .",
    "second , the earth has a massive iron - nickel core while the moon does not  making llr sensitive to a wep violation as well .",
    "laboratory ep tests of earth - like and moon - like objects falling toward the sun can be used to distinguish between an sep and a wep violation @xcite .",
    "llr tests the sep by measuring the difference in the accelerations of the earth and moon toward the sun . in the presence of a differential acceleration , the orbit of the moon  from our perspective on the earth  would appear to be displaced , or _ polarized _ , toward or away from the sun .",
    "the range signal would take the form@xmath46 where @xmath47 is the lunar orbit s synodic phase having a period of 29.53 days , with @xmath48 corresponding to new moon @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 is a theory - dependent dimensionless coefficient _ sensitive to almost every post - newtonian feature of the theory_. although @xmath49 vanishes in general relativity , it generally does not in alternative theories . but independent of any theory , this test of the sep addresses a very basic and important question ",
    "what is the weight of gravity itself ?",
    "it tests a crucial non - linear property of gravity : how gravity produces energy that itself gravitates .",
    "the metric models by damour and nordtvedt @xcite describe a relaxation of scalar field strength that today would produce sep differential accelerations between @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the present limit on differential acceleration is @xmath52 @xcite , corresponding to a test of the sep at the level of @xmath53 , given the self - energy fraction of the earth .",
    "millimeter - quality ranging stands to improve sensitivity of the sep test by one order of magnitude , measuring @xmath54 to a precision of @xmath55 and reaching into the theoretically motivated range indicated above .",
    "the closest competitor comes from pulsars .",
    "a composite of 27 pulsars places a 1-@xmath56 limit on the sep of @xmath57roughly an order of magnitude shy of the llr result @xcite",
    ".      a secular change in the gravitational constant , @xmath43 , would produce secular changes in the lunar mean distance and the orbital period ( kepler s third law ) , as well as in the angular rate of the earth about the sun .",
    "while the orbital radius change results in a range signal that varies linearly in time , the change in orbital period leads to a quadratic evolution of the moon s mean anomaly ( phase ) .",
    "it is this quadratic dependence that most powerfully constrains @xmath44 . here",
    ", the long time span of llr measurements becomes important , limiting @xmath58 at the impressive level of @xmath59 @xcite and @xmath60 @xcite  the best available experimental results .",
    "recently steinhardt and wesley examined the constraints that observations and experiment place on a broad class of theories that attempt to explain dark energy in the context of extra - dimensions @xcite .",
    "they find that if current constraints on _ both _ @xmath44 _ and _ the value and rate - of - change of the equation - of - state parameter , @xmath61 , improve by a factor of two , such ideas could be ruled out at the 3@xmath56 level . in their analysis , steinhardt and wesley use a 1994 pulsar timing limit for @xmath44 of @xmath62 .",
    "llr already exceeds this limit by an order of magnitude .",
    "a recent work questions the validity of several previous published pulsar limits on @xmath63including the 1994 result  finding instead trustworthy limits in the neighborhood of @xmath64 per year @xcite .",
    "however , a new report puts forth a limit at @xmath65 per year , approaching levels tested by llr @xcite .",
    "llr tests a number of basic relativistic phenomenologies  independent of whether gravity is described by a metric theory .",
    "these phenomena include gravitomagnetism , geodetic precession , and the consequences of preferred frames .",
    "many such phenomena can be cast into the parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) framework @xcite : a generalized metric description of gravity for which general relativity is a special case .",
    "the most prominent ppn parameters are @xmath66 , describing the amount of curvature produced per unit mass , and @xmath67 , describing the non - linearity of gravity",
    ". both of these are unity in general relativity .",
    "the best constraint on @xmath66 comes from doppler ranging to cassini : @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "@xmath67 is best constrained by llr tests of the sep via the identity : @xmath69 . combining the cassini result for @xmath66 with the llr result for @xmath49 yields @xmath70 @xcite .    preferred frame effects , such as those codified by ppn parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 , are also tested by llr , currently at the level of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively @xcite , although nordtvedt obtains a @xmath36 limit on @xmath72 based on the long - term orientation of the spin axis of the sun @xcite .",
    "gravitomagnetism is a generic consequence of any mass in motion .",
    "as the earth orbits the sun , its gravitomagnetic field exerts a lorentz force on the moon .",
    "eliminating the gravitomagnetic term from the eih equations of motion would result in experimentally - absent six - meter - amplitude periodic disturbances at both synodic and twice - synodic frequencies @xcite .",
    "llr constrains gravitomagnetism  the root of `` frame dragging''to @xmath75% precision , as confirmed by a covariant analysis @xcite . within the ppn context",
    ", gravitomagnetism reduces to non - competitive checks on parameters @xmath66 and @xmath71 . by comparison ,",
    "the gravity probe - b experiment obtained a final precision on the gravitomagnetic effect of 19% @xcite , and laser ranging to the lageos satellites produce results in the 540% range @xcite .",
    "pulsars may soon contribute gravitomagnetic limits as well , although no pulsar results have been published to date .",
    "gravitomagnetism , at its core , is a frame - dependent phenomenology . as such",
    ", the assertion that llr is sensitive to gravitomagnetism has been questioned from the point of view that one may nullify the effect by performing llr analysis in an earth - centered frame @xcite .",
    "leaving aside complications arising from the fact that the resulting frame is non - inertial ( not asymptotically flat ) , the attempt to separate gravitomagnetism into `` intrinsic '' and `` gauge - dependent '' varieties is , in the author s view , as specious as it would be for the magnetic field of electromagnetism : there are not two physically distinct flavors of magnetic fields . a similar argument",
    "could be made that performing analysis of lageos or gravity probe - b measurements of lense - thirring or schiff precessions , respectively , in a frame rotating with the earth would likewise eliminate the source of gravitomagnetism .",
    "obviously other frame - dependent phenomenologies should intercede to produce the same observational result , but this merely amplifies the notion of gravitomagnetism as part of the frame - transformation package .",
    "keeping in mind that converting measurements into the ssb frame for llr analysis reduces to a straightforward matter of time transformation , as summarized in section  [ sub : fundamental - measurement - and ] , the lack of anomalous gravitomagnetic signatures when evaluating llr data in the context of the eih equations of motion essentially stands as confirmation that gravitomagnetism plays its expected role in frame transformation @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the ppn preferred frame parameter , @xmath71 , in the coefficient for the gravitomagnetic term in the equations of motion further clarifies this association .",
    "geodetic precession can be understood as the effect of parallel transport of a fixed direction  as manifested by a gyroscope or orbital axis , for instance  around the curved space surrounding a central body .",
    "the curvature results in a migration of the axis direction relative to the background inertial space upon completing an orbit .",
    "one revolution around the sun at the distance of the earth produces a directional offset of 19.2 milliarcseconds . this precession rate in the orientation of the lunar orbit",
    "is confirmed by llr @xcite , presently at the 0.3% level , corresponding to about 60  @xmath12as  yr@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "geodetic precession is primarily another measure of ppn @xmath66 .",
    "the gravity probe - b mission finalized a result on geodetic precession at the 0.28% level .",
    "pulsar timing has thus far confirmed geodetic precession at the 13% level @xcite .",
    "any deviation from the newtonian @xmath6 force law produces a precession of orbital perigee .",
    "llr s measurement of any anomalous precession rate of the lunar orbit limits the strength of yukawa - like long - range forces with ranges comparable to the @xmath76  m scale of the lunar orbit to @xmath77 times the strength of gravity @xcite .",
    "this is the strongest available constraint on the inverse square law at any length scale @xcite .",
    "measurement of the precession rate can also probe a recent idea ( called dgp gravity ) in which the accelerated expansion of the universe arises not from a non - zero cosmological constant but rather from a long - range modification of the gravitational coupling , brought about by higher - dimensional effects @xcite .",
    "even though the lunar orbit is far smaller than the gigaparsec length - scale characteristic of the anomalous coupling , there would be a measurable signature of this new physics , manifesting itself as an anomalous precession rate at about @xmath78as  yr@xmath4roughly a factor of 10 below current llr limits , and potentially reachable by millimeter - quality llr .",
    "another example of new tests that llr can perform is represented by the standard model extension ( sme ) , in which lorentz - violating terms are introduced into the standard model of physics in order to generalize it @xcite .",
    "expressed in the gravitational sector @xcite , the sme exerts some influence on the lunar orbit @xcite .",
    "accordingly , llr has been used to place constraints on the relevant sme parameters@xcite .    offering a high - precision measurement of a clean dynamical system",
    ", llr constitutes a comprehensive check on gravitational phenomenology . as such",
    ", we can expect that llr will continue to exhibit sensitivity to future theories that challenge the foundation of general relativity .      while tests of gravitation constitute a compelling suite of scientific motivations for pursuing llr , details of the earth and moon",
    "also influence the range measurement and as such open lines of inquiry into the natures of these bodies .",
    "a more detailed treatment of these aspects appears in another review @xcite , and are here briefly summarized .      by virtue of the fact that the moon s orientation , orbit , and tidal deformation are influenced by the interaction of its internal mass structure with torques and forces imposed upon it ,",
    "llr data can expose properties of the lunar interior otherwise unavailable .    the moon is tidally locked to the earth , with the equatorial bulge elongated in the earth - moon direction , resulting in a triaxial mass distribution  the associated moments of inertia labeled and ordered as @xmath79 .",
    "torques on this non - spherical body from the earth , sun , and larger / closer planets impose physical librations , or rocking , of approximately @xmath80  arcsec in both longitude and latitude .",
    "this is distinct from the much larger `` optical '' libration caused by earth s changing vantage point of the moon in its elliptical , inclined orbit . at the surface of the moon ,",

    "in addition , the lunar quadrupole moment @xmath42 couples to the lunar orbit and is fit from llr data .",

    "] , @xmath91 , for the moon is very small , at about 0.04 ( contrast to earth @xmath92 ) , so the total amplitude is held to less than a meter .",
    "optical librations limit the motion of the bulge relative to the lunar surface to @xmath93 , so that any given spot on the moon sees tidal variations only at the level of @xmath94  m , peaking at 45@xmath95 from the earth - moon line .",
    "varying distance between earth and moon contributes an additional @xmath96  m deformation , aligned with the bulge @xcite .",

    "evaluating the center - to - center earth - moon range for access to gravitational physics relies on detailed knowledge of the three - dimensional orientation of the earth at the time of observation .",
    "llr can therefore contribute to our knowledge and understanding of the responsible phenomenologies .",
    "earth orientation can be described as three euler angles , broken into rotation about the polar axis , and two angles representing the direction of said axis on the sky .",
    "additionally , the rotation axis migrates with respect to the geometrical surface on a 10  m scale over approximately annual periods ( this includes the chandler wobble ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : x - y - polar ] ) .",
    "the trajectory of the axis on the sky is largely deterministic , described by precession and nutation and related to known torques acting on the earth s figure .",
    "nutation is dominated by an 18.6 year term relating to precession of the lunar orbital plane , and amounting to the equivalent of 300  m at the earth s surface .",
    "earth s slowing rotation due to tidal dissipation ( accompanied by an llr - determined 3.8  cm  yr@xmath4 egress of the lunar orbit @xcite ) results in a secular phase offset in the rotation angle , also influenced by periodic phenomena like tides , and by aperiodic factors like angular momentum exchange between ocean , atmosphere , and land .    in practice ,",
    "all five orientation parameters must be supplied or augmented by observational measurements or corrections .",
    "nutation adjustments tend to be less than 1  m ( fig .",

    "ut1 , characterizing the rotational state relative to atomic time , can vary by as much as 3.5  ms in a day ( accumulating to almost one second per year around 1995 ) , translating to 1.6  m at earth s surface ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ut1 ] and [ fig : lod ] ) .",
    "the point , again , is that llr is sensitive to each of the earth orientation parameters , so that the llr dataset can be used to supplement our understanding of these phenomena ( e.g. , biskupek and m \" uller 2009 @xcite ) .",
    "llr data are therefore routinely combined with data from very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) , gps , satellite laser ranging ( slr ) , and doppler orbitography and radiopositioning integrated by satellite ( doris ) in the earth orientation parameters published by the international earth rotation and reference system service ( iers ) , who also periodically publish self - consistent , evolving methods for computing earth orientation @xcite .",
    "finally , llr also contributes to establishment of coordinate systems , especially in defining the relative orientation of the ecliptic and equatorial planes .",
    "this in turn plays a role in establishing the celestial coordinate origin , whether in the international celestial reference system ( icrf ) or the dynamical ecliptic / equator of j2000.0 ( whose coordinate origins differ by 17  mas ) .",
    "precession and nutation are defined with respect to the celestial frame , so that llr s sensitivity to the earth axis orientation ties into this context as well .",
    "beginning with a historical introduction , this section looks at past and current llr capabilities , and how the current state of the art facilitates improved scientific return from llr .",
    "less than two weeks after the landing of the first retroreflector array on the apollo 11 mission , the first accurate laser ranges to the moon were performed on 1969 august 1 from the 3.1  m telescope at the lick observatory .",
    "a few other sites around the world demonstrated lunar ranging capability around that time , but none of these stations  including the lick observatory  embarked on scientific campaigns to obtain meaningfully long time series of accurate ranges .",
    "however , one month after the apollo  11 landing , a long - term effort using the 2.7  meter telescope at the mcdonald observatory commenced ranging to the moon @xcite , providing all of the scientifically relevant observations over the next decade .",
    "the mcdonald station used a ruby laser with a 4  ns pulse width , firing at a repetition rate of about 0.3  hz and @xmath98  j per pulse .",
    "this station routinely achieved 20  cm range precision , with a photon return rate as high as 0.2 photons per pulse , or 0.06 photons per second .",
    "a typical `` normal point''a representative measurement for a run typically lasting tens of minutes  was constructed from approximately 20 photon returns .    in the mid 1980 s ,",
    "a lunar ranging renaissance took place , with three capable stations beginning operation . in 1984 , a french station at the observatoire de la cte dazur ( oca ) @xcite began collecting accurate ranges . using a 1.5  meter telescope , a 70  ps nd : yag laser firing at 10  hz and 75  mj per pulse , oca became the premier lunar ranging station in the world and has contributed about half of the total range measurements to date . from 19841990 ,",
    "a station at haleakala in hawaii produced strong returns and accurate ranges . in 1985 , the mcdonald operation transitioned from the 2.7  m shared astronomical telescope to a dedicated 0.76  m telescope ( also used for satellite laser ranging ) using a 200  ps nd : yag laser operating at 10  hz and 150  mj per pulse .",
    "this station is referred to as the mcdonald laser ranging system ( mlrs ) @xcite . from 19902006 ,",
    "the mlrs and oca stations were the only routine contributors to lunar range data with characteristic return rates of 0.002 and 0.01 photons per pulse , respectively .",
    "normal points from the two stations typically consist of 15 and 40 photons , respectively .",
    "more complete histories of these and other efforts ( russia , pic du midi , australia , japan , etc . ) may be found in other works @xcite .",
    "presently , five stations in the world exhibit llr capability : oca , mlrs , apache point , matera , and wetzell  although only the first three acquire data regularly . after a shutdown from 20052010",
    ", oca is back in regular operation , although at about half its former pace . since 2007",
    ", the apache point observatory lunar laser - ranging operation ( apollo ; for which the author is the principal investigator ) has led the llr data effort both in terms of number of normal points and estimated range uncertainty . averaging about 260 measurements per year and a median statistical uncertainty per normal point of less than 3  mm , apollo seeks to effect a substantial improvement in llr tests of gravity .",
    "this section provides a brief overview of the apollo apparatus and its demonstrated performance .",
    "a full description of the apparatus can be found in murphy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) @xcite .",
    "apollo employs a laser averaging 2.3  w at 532  nm , generating 100  ps pulses at a 20  hz repetition rate and 115  mj per pulse .",
    "the laser is transmitted from the 3.5  m aperture telescope at the apache point observatory in southern new mexico at an elevation of 2.8  km .",
    "the full aperture is utilized for beam transmission .",
    "a small portion of the outgoing beam is intercepted by a corner cube prism attached to the telescope secondary mirror , sending light back to the receiver , attenuated to the single - photon level and providing a precise measure of the pulse departure time .",
    "the receiver houses a @xmath99 avalanche photodiode ( apd ) array capable of high - precision timing of single photons at a detection sensitivity around 30% .",
    "the array occupies a re - imaged focal plane of the telescope , spanning 1.4  arcsec on a side .",
    "this arrangement results in an oversampled point spread function , while providing spatial information useful for tracking feedback .",
    "photon arrivals create start pulses for a 16-channel time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) with 15  ps jitter and 25  ps bins .",
    "stop pulses to the tdc are extracted from a 50  mhz low - phase - noise clock pulse train , and the number of clock pulses between the stop signal for the local corner cube return and the stop signal for the lunar return is counted .",
    "the master clock on which the 50  mhz pulse train is generated uses an ovenized quartz crystal disciplined by reference to gps so that the 2.5  s round - trip travel time is measured against a reliable frequency standard , and the absolute time is known far better than the microsecond level required for millimeter range precision .",
    "table  [ tab : error - budget ] reproduces the contributions to apollo s random uncertainty from the instrument description paper @xcite .",
    "lcc error source & rms error ( ps ) & rms error ( mm ) + apd illumination & 60 & 9 + apd intrinsic & @xmath100 & @xmath101 + laser pulse & 45 & 7 + timing electronics & 20 & 3 + gps clock & 7 & 1 + total apollo & 93 & 14 + retroreflector array & 100300 & 1545 + total random uncertainty & 136314 & 2047 +    the large telescope aperture , good atmospheric seeing , and array detector together result in high signal rates and allow confident signal optimization through pointing corrections and velocity aberration compensation ",
    "controlled by affecting a deliberate offset in transmitter and receiver pointing directions .",
    "consequently , apollo signal rates exceed those of previous stations by a substantial margin .",
    "table  [ tab : records ] displays apollo s record performance on each reflector .",
    "since each entry is associated with 5000-shot data runs , each transpired over approximately 250 seconds , at a 20 hz pulse repetition rate .",
    "the  photons \" column corresponds to detected photo - electrons , sometimes exceeding one photon per shot , as enabled by apollo s multi - element apd detector .",
    "the `` rate factor '' compares apollo s peak photon rate ( photons / minute ) to that of the previous llr record for each reflector , held in every case by oca  except for lunokhod  1 , which was first recovered by apollo , as described in section  [ sub : finding - lunokhod-1 ] .",
    "cccccc reflector & shots & photons & photons / shot & photons / minute & rate factor + apollo 11 & 5000 & 4784 & 0.96 & 1148 & 69 + apollo 14 & 5000 & 7606 & 1.52 & 1825 & 69 + apollo 15 & 5000 & 15730 & 3.15 & 3775 & 67 + lunokhod 1 & 5000 & 2070 & 0.41 & 497 &  + lunokhod 2 & 5000 & 1301 & 0.26 & 312 & 54 +    greater photon count is not in itself indicative of higher precision range measurements .",
    "but to the extent that the temporal spread of the lunar return is dominated by the finite size of the reflector array  tilted by lunar libration  high photon number is a necessary ingredient in reducing statistical uncertainty , as was illustrated in section  [ sub : reflectors - and - divergence ] .",
    "two different evaluations of apollo s millimeter - level performance have been published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned signal optimization capability of apollo naturally translates into faster acquisition and a higher signal rate ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : a15-run ] for an example ) , which enhance the range precision and scientific usefulness of the data . but a number of derivative advantages emerge as well , outlined here . as a general statement",
    ", systematic effects are more easily exposed in a high - signal regime .",
    "foremost , apollo routinely ranges to four , and sometimes five reflectors in each observing session . typically , it is possible to make several circuits of the reflectors within the @xmath102  hr time allocation ( figs .",
    "[ fig : np - refl ] and [ fig : refl - spread ] ) .",
    "the result is that lunar orientation and deformation are well - established during each session .",
    "this bestows an obvious advantage onto understanding of the lunar interior , but also enhances the ability to represent accurately the location and trajectory of the center of mass of the moon ",
    "important for testing gravitation .",
    "having multiple detector channels essentially provides many independent measurements : each channel receives photons from the local ( fiducial ) corner cube as well as from the lunar array .",
    "one may then compare `` answers '' from each of the channels to get a separate handle on measurement error .",
    "the degree to which measurements disagree provides a check on estimated uncertainties .",
    "the signal rate is high enough to permit exploration of the physical orientation of the reflector arrays on the moon via the evolution of the temporal response as a function of lunar libration .",
    "this is especially effective on the larger , rectangular apollo  15 array , which appears to have a 2@xmath95 azimuth offset , but otherwise nominal tilts .",
    "the smaller apollo arrays are consistent with nominal pointing , although probed less accurately .",
    "incorporating array orientation information into the data reduction routines allows a higher fidelity fit to the observations , reducing the opportunity for systematic offsets . ultimately , it may be possible to elucidate spatial variability of response across the reflector array",
    "recent improvement in the llr return rate has facilitated some new findings , two of which are detailed here : first the re - discovery of a reflector that had been lost for nearly four decades ; followed by an account of evidence for degraded reflector performance .      starting in 2008 , apollo devoted some observing time to searching for the lost lunokhod  1 reflector .",
    "accurate coordinates were not available , so searches were referenced to the best - guess coordinates of the time @xcite . given a @xmath13  km beam footprint ,",
    "the 5  km positional uncertainty can be scanned in a matter of minutes , so that angular parameter space was not the main limitation .",
    "rather , the 100  ns timing gate used for the apd detector array translates into a @xmath103  m line - of - sight uncertainty , intersecting the tilted lunar surface at the position of lunokhod  1 in a @xmath104  m swath",
    ". therefore searches concentrated exclusively on the temporal domain while pointing at the nominal position and allowing natural pointing excursions to provide some degree of angular coverage .",
    "the lunar reconnaissance orbiter ( lro ) helped in three ways .",
    "most indirectly , corner cube prisms were placed on lro in the hope that apollo could obtain 2-way range measurements to the spacecraft .",
    "this prompted apollo to develop a wide - gate ( 800  ns ) mode to cope with positional uncertainty of lro .",
    "second , lro s lunar orbiter laser altimeter ( lola ) provided an accurate radial coordinate of the plain on which lunokhod  1 sits .",
    "but by far the most important contribution was high - resolution imaging , identifying the rover in 2010 march , and providing coordinates accurate to approximately 100  m ( fig .  [ fig : lunokhod ] ) .",
    "on 2010 april 22 , apollo got a strong return from the lunokhod  1 reflector , appearing 270  ns later than the time prediction based on the lro - provided coordinates . recording about 2000 photons in the initial 10,000 shot run , lunokhod  1 had instantly outperformed the best photon yield apollo had seen over five years of observing the lunokhod  2 reflector ( in 44 prior measurements ) .",
    "since this time , the position  off from the earlier working estimate by 5  km , and off from the lro - provided coordinates by 100  m  has been refined to the centimeter level @xcite .",
    "the lunokhod  1 reflector is located @xmath105 from the selenographic coordinate origin , making it the farthest reflector from the apparent lunar center : about twice as far as the apollo reflectors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : locations ] ) .",
    "this makes lunokhod  1 a more sensitive probe of lunar orientation than the other reflectors .",
    "moreover , its location allows sensitivity to librations in both latitude and longitude , while the apollo reflectors lie close to the equator or prime meridian , resulting in each being mostly sensitive to librations in only one principal dimension .      despite confident optimization of telescope pointing , velocity aberration correction , laser beam divergence , and telescope",
    "focus ( see section  [ sub : apollo - apparatus ] ) , the apollo link budget has never matched its theoretical potential ",
    "falling short by an order of magnitude , even on the best nights @xcite .",
    "this appears to be true for other llr stations as well , based on comparing performance to expectations with respect to system parameters .",
    "more telling is the observation that the signal level near full moon phase drops by another order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "examination of the earliest range data from the mcdonald 2.7  m telescope reveals the slow onset of this phenomenon , so that the cause appears to be progressive in nature .",
    "lunar eclipse observations contribute a substantial clue , in that the signal performance soars to normal levels within 15 minutes of entering full shadow .",
    "this strongly suggests solar energy absorption leading to thermal gradients in the corner cube prisms .",
    "the apollo corner cubes and associated mounts were carefully designed to minimize solar absorption and thermal gradients by a combination of total internal reflection , recessed corner cubes , radiation - resistant substrate , and minimization of mount conductance .",
    "thermal simulations predicted a central irradiance of the far - field diffraction pattern emerging from the corner cubes at full moon to be @xmath106% of the peak performance .",
    "a gradient as small as @xmath107  k from the front surface to the corner cube vertex essentially nullifies the central irradiance @xcite .",
    "the most likely explanation is the slow accumulation of a very thin layer of dust on the reflector front surface , transported by electrostatic levitation ( via photoionization and solar wind charge deposition @xcite ) and cascading disturbances from impacts .",
    "approximately half of the reflector surface would need to be covered by dust to produce a ten - fold reduction in central irradiance , since each dust grain counts twice in a double - pass of the front surface , and the central intensity otherwise scales as the square of the clear area .",
    "meanwhile , this same @xmath108% fill - factor could result in enough front - surface thermal absorption to generate a thermal gradient sufficiently large to cause an additional large signal deficit .    indeed",
    ", the eclipse observations validate this picture , in that after the initial signal surge upon entering shadow , the return strength plummets to sub - detectable levels .",
    "when light returns , the signal peaks again before settling back to levels typical for the full moon .",
    "the interpretation is that initially the corner cube has a strong positive thermal gradient owing to a heated front surface .",
    "as the solar illumination fades , the corner cube begins to radiate its stored energy to space via the front surface , cooling off and reversing the gradient .",
    "a zero - crossing occurs as the gradient evolves from positive to negative , so that the reflector performance momentarily recovers during the approximately isothermal state .",
    "when light returns , the gradient changes sign again , passing through zero a second time for a temporary surge in signal strength .",
    "one final aspect of the degradation story is that lunokhod  2 was initially observed in 1971 to be comparable in strength to the apollo  15 reflector . indeed ,",
    "cross section predictions put the expected lunokhod response midway between the 100-element apollo  11/14 reflectors and the 300-element apollo  15 reflector . today , lunokhod  2 registers at about 10% the strength of the apollo  15 array .",
    "thus it is clear that the reflectors can experience _ relative _ changes in performance over time .",
    "meanwhile , the three apollo reflectors are observed to maintain a 3:1:1 ratio , and all exhibit a comparable full - moon deficit .",
    "the lunokhod  1 array typically performs similarly to  if not better than  the smaller apollo arrays .",
    "its degradation therefore appears to be roughly in step with that of the apollo reflectors , making the identically - designed lunokhod  2 reflector the truly anomalous case .",
    "the possibility of dynamic dust on the moon impacts ambitions for lunar - based telescopes or mechanical equipment .",
    "the still - functioning reflectors have often been held up as evidence that dust is not a major issue .",
    "the recent observations described here cast doubt on this picture .",
    "sitting between accurate range measurements and scientific results is a complex model whose development must keep pace with observational advances in order to realize the full potential of llr . here",
    "we describe the requisite components of a model , discuss current capabilities , and explore improvements to be made .",
    "the crux of any scientific endeavor is the comparison between theory and experiment . for llr",
    ", the theory piece is represented by a model of the solar system incorporating some prescription for gravity and all other physical effects that can render an impact on the measurement .",
    "for example , venus and jupiter generate perturbations in the earth - moon separation on the order of 1  km , mars and saturn at the 100  m level , and even the largest asteroids chalk up millimeter - scale deviations .",
    "it is therefore clearly important to have an accurate representation of solar system dynamics .    but because llr is performed in relation to the _ surfaces _ of the earth and moon , it is also necessary to provide accurate descriptions of body orientations and deformations . in the case of the earth ,",
    "non - deterministic mass flows in the atmosphere and ocean complicate matters .",
    "body torques between earth and moon not only affect orientation , but also couple into orbital dynamics .",
    "tidal dissipation likewise translates into an orbital egress of the moon at the rate of about 38  mm  yr@xmath4 .",
    "crustal loading influences from the ocean , atmosphere , and ground water come into play for the earth station .",
    "light propagation effects must also be considered .",
    "sensibly cast in the solar system barycenter frame ( see section  [ sub : fundamental - measurement - and ] ) , the light path forms two legs of a generally asymmetric triangle .",
    "the shapiro delay associated with propagation through solar and terrestrial gravitational potentials must be incorporated , amounting to a @xmath109  ns modification to the round - trip time ( 7.5  m one - way equivalent due to the sun ; 0.04  m from the earth potential ) .",
    "propagation through the atmosphere incurs a roughly 2  m path delay that must be determined and removed to high precision .",
    "the model itself is constructed as a parameterized physical description , many pieces of which are numerically integrated simultaneously .",
    "for example , solar system bodies are represented as point masses , where model parameters are initial positions and velocities , and the associated mass values .",
    "the earth and moon and sun are treated as non - point masses , in which case the dynamical torques are jointly computed to follow the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "partial derivatives of the computed range with respect to each model parameter are calculated for each measurement epoch so that a least - squares covariant parameter adjustment may be executed . by iterating such adjustments , the set of llr observations",
    "can be used to converge on a physical description of the solar system that is optimally consistent with the data . a cute way to put",
    "this is that millimeter - level measurement / model fidelity in the earth - moon range can in principle determine the mass and position of jupiter to a part in a million , given the kilometer - scale influence jupiter has on the lunar orbit . in practice ,",
    "irregular data sampling together with correlations between many model parameters compromise complete separation of variables . over the long term , periodic effects from solar system bodies tend to be separable .",
    "but some parameters tend to remain highly correlated , like the @xmath110 value for the earth - moon system and the semi - major axis of the lunar orbit .",
    "several llr models exist in the world , sited at the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) , the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) , the leibniz university in hannover , germany , and at the imcce in paris , france . of these ,",
    "only the planetary ephemeris program ( pep ) , at the cfa , is made available to the community ( and as open - source code ) .",
    "the jpl model currently demonstrates the best performance , producing weighted rms residuals for both apollo and oca data in the neighborhood of 18  mm , which is roughly a factor of two better than the other models at present .",
    "clearly a gap exists between estimated apollo uncertainties of a few millimeters and the model residuals .",
    "the cfa , paris , and hannover efforts are currently engaged in a stepwise comparative effort to identify model differences , shortcomings , and errors .",
    "additionally , apollo data are being used to illuminate one aspect of model performance by exploiting the fact that most observing sessions result in measurements to multiple reflectors .",
    "this provides a nearly direct measurement of lunar orientation , the stability of which is confirmed on occasions when several circuits of the reflectors are made in a short period @xcite . in brief , the result of this exercise is a determination of how much adjustment is needed in the latitude and longitude librations of the moon to bring the residuals among the reflectors in line with each other .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : lib - adjust ] . for reference",
    ", 1  nrad of angle translates to 1.7  mm of range at the lunar limb , or about 0.7  mm at the typical position of an apollo reflector .",
    "again it is clear that jpl has an advantage over the other efforts , although the paris result does not represent a least - squares - adjusted integration , but rather uses the jpl exported ephemeris , de423 .",
    "lcc model & longitude adjustment ( nrad ) & latitude adjustment ( nrad ) + jpl & 5.1 & 7.3 + cfa & 19 & 23 + hannover & 23 & 36 + paris & 29 & 76 +    lunar orientation is one of many components in the model , so that adjusting the librations in an ad - hoc manner based on apollo residuals does not markedly improve the overall rms of residuals  the main effect being to better cluster residuals from different reflectors within each night .",
    "night - to - night variations still dominate , and tend to look wholly different from one model to the next .",
    "each llr analysis group has its own list of known effects yet to be incorporated into the model  many of which are only beginning to be important at the millimeter level . by way of example , the following is a list of known effects not yet incorporated into pep at cfa .",
    "other groups may be in different states with regard to these items .",
    "for pep , specific improvements to be made include :    * a more complete treatment of dissipation in the lunar interior , following jpl s lead ; * a more rigorous tidal model , applying love numbers that depend on frequency and spherical harmonic degree and order , aided by inputs from vlbi and gps ; * updating the gravitational multipoles of the earth and moon , using the latest data from the grace and grail missions , respectively ; * improved earth orientation handling , including feedback of llr residuals into the vlbi / gps - determined data ; * ocean loading , having approximately 3  mm horizontal rms and 5  mm vertical rms at the apollo site , for instance ; * atmospheric loading , having an impact of roughly 1  mm for every 3  mbar of pressure anomaly ; * earth center - of - mass motion , seen via slr to have a @xmath102  cm amplitude at an annual frequency .",
    "addressing the first three items  together with any errors discovered in the model intercomparison between pep and the european models  may in fact bring pep in line with the present jpl model capability .",
    "the remaining effects could conceivably add up to accommodate the @xmath13  cm residuals still exhibited by the jpl model .",
    "we discuss them here .",

    "global models for these are advancing rapidly thanks to data from the grace mission @xcite .",
    "these can be improved by combining , for example , global models of air pressure with the more detailed ( `` mesoscale '' ) local models that are now produced for regional weather forecasting .",
    "satellite laser ranging measurements show a displacement of earth s center - of - mass with respect to coordinates of the geometrical center ( as defined by a network of ground stations ) .",
    "this motion has a roughly annual period and an amplitude of about a centimeter @xcite .",
    "llr analysis has not yet incorporated this effect .",
    "however , the presence of the nearby a gps station ( described in section  [ sub : uncharted - improvements ] ) will allow us to incorporate the slr result on geocenter motion into the analysis of apollo data .",
    "additionally , radiation pressure is known to be a @xmath120  mm @xmath121 effect that can be applied @xcite .",
    "likewise , atmospheric propagation delay , a @xmath13  m effect , has been recently modeled to sub - millimeter accuracy for elevation angles above 20@xmath95 @xcite , and has since been incorporated into pep .",
    "as described , the items in the previous section are moderately well understood , in most cases having mature models and complementary observations providing input .",
    "but millimeter - quality llr data will likely strain current models and demand that new physical effects be addressed .",
    "apollo is provisioned to check how well displacements are being modeled by comparison to supplemental measurements of :    * site position by a nearby gps station ( p027 in the plate boundary observatory network ; 2.5  km away ) ; and * local @xmath122 by a superconducting gravimeter ( sg ) at apache point .    for daily estimates ,",
    "the gps positions at the p027 site typically have uncertainties of about 1.5  mm horizontally , and 6  mm vertically .",
    "monthly averages  where llr signatures are most relevant  have 0.3  mm horizontal and 1.2  mm vertical uncertainties .",
    "systematic errors prevent these precisions from direct translation into accuracies for motions relative to the earth s center - of - mass , but the gps data can still usefully check models for site displacements . fig .  [",
    "fig : gps ] shows data from the p027 site over four years , binned into periods of 27.55 days ( monthly periods are especially relevant to llr science ) . in the future , local gps measurements may be used to constrain site displacements in a simultaneous fit to llr data .",
    "likewise , precision gravimetry can complement the vertically - challenged gps measurements by monitoring surface gravity variations .",
    "a superconducting gravimeter mounted on the telescope pier of the apache point 3.5  m telescope has the sensitivity on one - minute timescales to resolve 0.1  mm vertical displacements by virtue of the fact that surface gravity diminishes by 3  nm  s@xmath31 for every millimeter of motion away from the center of the earth .",
    "the sg data measure local gravity variations with very low noise , excellent calibration stability , and low instrument drift .",
    "when the 1  hz sampled data are filtered to remove microseisms ( typically 20  nm / s@xmath123 peak - to - peak ; 515  s periods ) , the short - term noise level is less than @xmath124  nm / s@xmath123 peak - to - peak , corresponding to 0.1  mm in vertical displacement .",
    "[ fig : sg ] shows tides dominating the sg signal , but removal of tides and local atmospheric influence leaves a 60  nm / s@xmath123 peak - to - peak signal dominated by ocean loading , which when removed reveals small signals such as the gravitational influence of the rotating telescope dome .",
    "but a measurement of surface gravity only serves as a _",
    "proxy _ to displacement .",
    "direct gravitational attraction of loading sources ( atmosphere , ground water ) complicate the picture , and the mass redistribution accompanying tidal displacements change the potential  and therefore the gradient of the potential , which is the measured quantity .",
    "for tidal displacements , knowledge of the love numbers , @xmath125 and @xmath90 , and the deforming potential , @xmath126 , allows conversion from a measurement of the variation in gravitational acceleration , @xmath127 , to a vertical displacement , @xmath128 , via @xmath129 , and @xmath130 . in principle ,",
    "knowledge of the love numbers could come from the sg and/or the llr fit .",
    "a better source may be the recently much - improved elastic models for the western u.s .",
    "resulting from the u.s.a .",
    "array seismometer project .",
    "but some uncertainty remains in extrapolating from seismic frequencies to periods around a month .",
    "a modeling challenge of the future may be to apply the tidal model to simultaneously fit the llr data and gravimetry data . a demonstrated ability to model the sg data  especially the long - period terms  will provide an important estimate of the uncertainty from loading that can be included in fits to the data .",
    "part of the sg campaign involves occasional comparison to a visiting absolute gravimeter in order to calibrate long - term drift in the sg instrument .    in a similar vein , while atmospheric propagation delay is well described by measuring pressure , temperature , and humidity at the observing site and applying a mapping function to the elevation of the observation @xcite , horizontal pressure gradients may foil the usual single - point pressure measurements . using regional pressure data ( also useful for atmospheric loading corrections ) has been demonstrated to improve results @xcite .",
    "if greater precision is required , incorporation of data from a kilometer - scale barometric array may be employed to probe pressure gradients near the observatory  which may be impacted by wind interacting with geographical features , leading to dynamic pressure effects in the vicinity .",
    "in this section , we look at temporal aspects of the llr measurement and its related science goals . in the face of the large list of phenomenological influences on the fundamental llr measurement outlined in the preceding sections , it is important to remember that most of the science goals outlined in section  [ sec : science - from - llr ] rely on _ periodic _ range signatures .",
    "clearly the equivalence principle signal is periodic , displaying a @xmath121 form at a period of 29.530589 days .",
    "this is likewise true for gravitomagnetism and certain preferred frame effects .",
    "but even secular effects ultimately derive from periodic observables .",
    "for instance , a variation in @xmath43 alters the keplerian relationship between period and semi - major axis . the resulting secular change in period results in a quadratic phase evolution .",
    "obviously llr provides a nearly direct measurement of the semi - major axis , but it is also directly sensitive to the phase of the 21,000  km amplitude periodic variation due to orbital eccentricity .",
    "likewise , sensitivity to precession of the orbit is provided by monitoring the phase of the large - amplitude periodic behaviors in the orbit .",
    "the key point is that largely aperiodic phenomena like atmospheric loading , variations in atmospheric propagation delay , or anomalous meanderings in earth orientation are unlikely to mimic science signals at key lunar orbit periodicities . obviously , greater sensitivity to interesting science signals will derive from doing the best possible job modeling confounding influences , effectively lowering the background against which to seek small anomalous periodic signatures .    even with this in mind , in order to take full scientific advantage of the remarkable precision offered by llr",
    ", the data must extend over a long enough span to sample long - period terms in the lunar orbit so that secular / aperiodic trends can be distinguished from periodic signatures and optimum amplitudes of the various periodic signatures can be obtained .",
    "this generally requires a data span of at least a half - period  and preferably longer  of the longest important periodic term .",
    "the various monthly periods : draconic ( nodal passage : 27.212208 days ) ; sidereal ( inertial space period : 27.321661 days ) ; and anomalistic ( perigee - to - perigee : 27.554551 days ) combine to give periods of 6.00 years , 8.85 years , and 18.6 years . while the complete llr record now spans two of these longest periods , not all of these data are of comparable precision .",
    "there is also a 75  yr wobble in the physical libration with a @xmath131  m amplitude @xcite .",
    "how might we expect formal uncertainties to scale with data span ?",
    "for the periodic signals associated with the equivalence principle , gravitomagnetism , and preferred - frame effects , the uncertainty should scale as @xmath132 if the sampling is approximately uniform in time , where @xmath133 is the data span . for secular drift of the lunar orbital phase due to geodetic precession , deviations from the inverse square law , or extra - dimension - motivated precession effects",
    ", sensitivity scales as @xmath134 , where the additional power of @xmath133 comes from a longer baseline . for @xmath44 , which effectively gauges secular change of the orbital radius against that of the orbital period ,",
    "the uncertainty scales as @xmath135 , where two powers of @xmath133 come from the aforementioned quadratic evolution of phase .",
    "these scalings only apply to the extent that modeling capabilities are able to take full advantage of the measurement precision .",
    "we discuss here potential future directions for llr , together with a qualitative assessment of resulting scientific gains .",
    "lunar laser ranging has for decades stayed at the forefront of tests of gravity , probes of the lunar interior , and determination of earth coordinate systems .",
    "recent improvements to the technique have stimulated a push to improve modeling capabilities , which are expected to produce further gains in the short term .",
    "additionally , the llr enterprise has largely been confined to the northern hemisphere .",
    "steady data flow from a southern hemisphere station would allow better coverage of low - declination observations and better constrain earth orientation .",
    "longer - term , improvements at the lunar end offer the biggest advantage  in the form of either new reflectors , an active transponder , or both .",
    "the current reflectors limit performance in a compounded way . most fundamentally , the finite extent of the reflector array spreads the temporal width of the pulse by virtue of the fact that the array normal tilts away from the line of sight by up to 10@xmath95 due to lunar libration ( figs .  [",
    "fig : librations ] and [ fig : libration - histogram ] ) . this spread can be as large as one nanosecond for the apollo  15 array at full - tilt , corresponding to a root - mean - square measurement uncertainty approaching 50  mm ( 330  ps ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : a15-rms ] ) .",
    "statistical centroiding of the signal to millimeter - level range precision requires hundreds or thousands of photons .",
    "this is how apollo reaches the millimeter domain , but such an approach is not feasible for other llr stations .",
    "degraded reflector performance ( section  [ sub : reflector - degradation ] ) only exacerbates this problem .",
    "thus the brute force approach to llr by gathering more photons becomes more challenging with time .",
    "meanwhile , the spread imposed by the tilted reflector array eliminates incentives to improve ground - based laser pulse width or timing systems in any incremental fashion , since these errors add in quadrature to the dominant reflector spread .",
    "improving apollo s 100  ps laser pulse width and 20  ps timing system  even by a factor of two  would have little discernible impact on the net timing precision , and so would appear to be wasted effort . installing a larger array on the moon",
    "also has no effect , as doubling the linear dimension doubles the temporal spread , requiring four times the signal for statistical reduction to the same level  which is exactly what a double - sized array delivers : no precision gain .",
    "simply making a sparse array of corner cubes so that each one could easily be resolved by @xmath136  ps laser pulses would break the logjam .",
    "improvements in ground systems would then have immediate impact .",
    "halving the laser pulse width would consequently require four times fewer photons for similar statistical precision .",
    "most locations on the front face of the moon see the earth permanently well away from local zenith , so that a modest lateral separation on the ground ( @xmath137  cm ) is sufficient to separate the returns unambiguously .",
    "a few current efforts are underway to explore next - generation reflectors for the lunar surface .",
    "hollow corner cubes are being explored at the goddard space flight center using an ultra - stable quartz bonding technique @xcite . somewhat further along , work on 100  mm diameter fused silica corner cubes is in the space - environment testing phase to verify mitigation of thermal gradients in the presence of solar illumination @xcite .",
    "installing active laser transponders on the lunar surface would have perhaps an even greater impact on llr science . replacing",
    "the @xmath138 signal loss regime with a far more benign @xmath6 regime would allow the extensive slr network to engage in llr on a routine basis .",
    "this would have tremendous impact in data volume , global distribution ( fixing the southern hemisphere deficit , for instance ) , tie - in to well - established geodetic stations , and improvements in earth surface / atmospheric models by using the moon as a reference object largely unaffected by non - gravitational forces  unlike satellites . in this context , transponders work best in asynchronous mode , rather than echoing detected incoming signals .",
    "this permits the transponder to transmit a steady pulse train tied to a good clock while recording times of incoming signals with respect to this clock .",
    "the asynchronous mode has much greater noise immunity and thermal stability than echo - based techniques .",
    "such transponders also pave the way for interplanetary laser ranging .",
    "the scientific benefits and hardware requirements for one such system has been explored in the context of laser ranging to phobos @xcite .      on its face , improvement of llr measurement precision as facilitated by new reflectors , transponders , and concomitant ground station upgrades has the potential to sharpen our constraints on ( or find deviations in ) gravitational physics by a corresponding ( equal ) factor .",
    "time scales for improvement vary for different science parameters , as discussed in section  [ sub : periodicity ] , but in principle a factor - of - ten reduction in llr measurement uncertainty over a timescale of years to a decade has the potential to deliver factor - of - ten improvements in llr science .    yet",
    "recent experience demonstrates that improving llr measurement precision is not by itself sufficient to realize scientific gains .",
    "the model must also keep pace .",
    "sections  [ sub : charted - improvements ] and [ sub : uncharted - improvements ] provide a glimpse into the host of phenomena one must consider in plotting a course from centimeter - level to millimeter - level llr accuracy .",
    "progressing into the sub - millimeter regime will undoubtedly invoke a similarly - sized  if not larger  list of concerns that may or may not be tractable .",
    "even so , the aforementioned reflector / transponder upgrades would permit a greater global distribution of ever - improving llr - capable stations , in addition to relieving the current burden on statistical reduction of the dominant tilt - induced timing uncertainty .",
    "since many of the challenges confronting llr today relate to earth phenomenology , widespread global participation may be the best way to characterize these influences and reduce their impact on llr science goals .",
    "improved reflectors and/or transponders may provide the most robust route for future improvements in llr science .",
    "since its inception , llr has established itself as a mainstay of precision measurement relating to gravitation , physics of the earth - moon system , and coordinate systems .",
    "the basic measurement is general enough to have broad reach across many dimensions of physics . within the gravity sector",
    ", llr provides the very best probes of the equivalence principle , the time - rate - of - change of the gravitational constant , gravitomagnetism , geodetic precession , the inverse square law , preferred frame effects , and is also well positioned to test new ideas in physics . for the earth - moon system , dissipative processes in the lunar interior expose a liquid core , llr measurements contribute to knowledge of earth orientation and coordinate systems , and tidal dissipation on earth",
    "is seen via the egress of the lunar orbit .    despite order - of - magnitude degradation of reflector signal strength ,",
    "llr data are now gathered at unprecedented rates and approaching one - millimeter range precision as a consequence .",
    "rediscovery of the long - lost lunokhod  1 reflector brings the total available reflectors on the moon up to five . at this time , the lunar reflectors are the limiting source of temporal uncertainty in the ranging error budget , so that new reflectors on the lunar surface would offer a dramatic improvement in range precision capability . additionally , new reflectors or even transponders on the lunar surface",
    "could open up llr to dozens of satellite laser ranging stations around the world , vastly improving data volume , global distribution , and interest in the science .    alongside the challenge of acquiring accurate lunar range measurements , the sophisticated model that accounts for every relevant influence must see concomitant improvements .",
    "currently in the process of adapting to millimeter - quality data after decades of centimeter - quality measurements , newly improved limits on science from llr may be around the corner .",
