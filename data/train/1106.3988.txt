    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) without an optical counterpart of their x - ray afterglow are usually called `` dark bursts '' ; a more precise definition based on their x - ray to optical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) has been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is clear now that in most cases extinction by dust in their host galaxies makes these afterglows optically dim @xcite , while cosmological lyman drop out ( high redshift ) or intrinsic faintness are the exception rather than the rule @xcite .",

    "@xcite report that the xrt light curve between 1.30hr and 4.72hr after the grb start time declines monotonically with a power - law of index @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , we have assumed that the optical light curve in the same time interval is also decreasing monotonically , so that its behavior is sufficiently regular that the criterion of @xcite to define grb `` darkness ''  based on the comparison of the x - ray and optical flux levels at 11hr  can be applied to the optical upper limit @xmath10 measured at 1.69 hr after the trigger .",

    "the average xrt spectrum in the above time interval , @xmath14 , corresponds to a 1kev flux of 4.2 @xmath15jy .",
    "together with the simultaneous optical upper limit , this yields an optical - to - x - ray index of @xmath16 , which leads to a dark grb classification , according to @xcite and @xcite .    in the vicinity of the xrt error circle , @xcite found two very faint host candidates , one better visible in vimos/@xmath17-band and the second brighter in @xmath18 .",
