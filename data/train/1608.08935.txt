    "this approach goes beyond rotating wave approximation and slowly - varying envelope approximation , allowing to treat fundamental and third harmonic on the same footing and describe photonic structures that vary on scales much smaller than the wavelength .",

    "we see that the mirror used in the simulation reflects almost perfectly in a broad spectral region around the central wavelength of the pulse .",
    "we further calculate the absorption of the structure as @xmath67 , shown in fig .",

    "the absorption is mostly determined by the qw and thus we find a similar behavior as in fig .",
    "[ fig : onlyqwabsorption ] with a resonance at the exciton energy .",
    "the resonance height is increased by a factor of @xmath68 in comparison with the isolated qw , as a consequence of the almost four - fold enhancement in intensity introduced by the structure , while the in - band absorption is now decreasing the further we go from the band edge .",
    "the difference is due to the mirror which is optimized for the central wavelength of the pulse and whose reflectance decreases with the distance from the exciton .",

    "the pulses are resonant with the exciton ( @xmath69 ) and have a fwhm of @xmath70 . figure  [ fig : thg_spectra ]",
    "shows the spectra of the reflected intensity for the same peak intensities used in fig .",
    "[ fig : onlyqwspectra ] , namely @xmath71 .",
    "similarly to what happened for the isolated qw , increasing the intensity of the exciting pulse brings a second spectral peak above the background .",
    "this is located at three times the pulse energy and is due to thg in the semiconductor layer of the structure . by comparing the spectra with fig .",
    "[ fig : onlyqwspectra ] we see that the third harmonic is more intense in the sesam structure than it is for an isolated qw excited with the same pulse .",
    "this is due to the structure enhancing the field at the qw position .",
    "the oscillations appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig : thg_spectra ] , particularly evident in the fundamental peak , are due to the fabry - prot resonance associated with the whole structure .     as a function of the spectrally integrated intensity @xmath72 of the incoming pulse on a log - log scale for @xmath69 ( black squares ) and @xmath73 ( red circles ) .",
    "the dashed lines are the best fit of the data according to eq .",
    "[ eq : intensity_dependence_linear].[fig : thg_intensity ] ]    a more quantitative analysis of the intensity is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : thg_intensity ] , where we plot the integrated intensity of the thg as function of the incoming pulse integrated intensity .",
    "the two sets of data correspond to different excitation energies , where one is obtained with pulses resonant with the exciton @xmath69 ( squares ) and one with off - resonant pulses with @xmath73 ( circles ) .",
    "the spectrally integrated intensity of the fundamental and its third harmonic are defined as the integral of the intensity over the corresponding spectral peak ,    @xmath74    where the integration is carried out over the width of the highest intensity peak .",
    "we find that the intensity of the thg has a power law behavior as function of the incoming field , @xmath75 , as @xmath76 in the log - log plot this is seen as a linear curve , where we can get the value of the exponent by performing a linear fit of the logarithm of the data according to @xmath77 which gives the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : thg_intensity ] .",
    "the values obtained for the exponents ( slope of the lines ) are @xmath78 for the off - resonant configuration and @xmath79 for the pulses resonant with the exciton energy .",
    ", obtained by fitting eq .",
    "[ eq : intensity_dependence_linear ] , as function of the pulse energy @xmath80 .",
    "the inset shows the residual density as a function of the spectrally integrated intensity for resonant and off - resonant excitations.[fig : thg_pulse ] ]    figure  [ fig : thg_pulse ] shows the value of the exponent @xmath81 as a function of the central wavelength of the pulse .",
    "similarly to fig .",
    "[ fig : thg_intensity ] we have performed a linear fit of eq .",
    "[ eq : intensity_dependence_linear ] to different sets of data .",
    "we see that when the excitation is enough off - resonant , i.e. , the pulse energy lies in the band gap of the semiconductor , the value of @xmath81 approaches an asymptotic value of @xmath82 which is consistent with a phenomenological description in terms of the non - linear susceptibility of third order , @xmath83.@xcite conversely , as the excitation gets closer to be resonant we observe a decrease in @xmath81 down to a value of about @xmath84 . a similar non cubic dependence has been observed by @xcite while performing four wave mixing experiments on znse qws with the central laser energy close to resonance with the exciton .",
    "we want to stress that we are able to uncover this unusual behavior only due to a self - consistent combination of the bloch equations with a description of the light field using a full time - domain ( fdtd ) code with spatial resolution on sub - wavelength scales .",
    "to further investigate the origin of this subcubic dependence , we analyzed the density of carriers generated by pulses with different detuning from the excitonic resonance .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : thg_pulse ] shows the density remaining in the semiconductor after the pulse has left the simulation domain as a function of the spectrally integrated intensity of the exciting pulse .",
    "we see that the amount of population generated in the qw is significantly higher under resonant excitation , even for the lowest intensity generating a thg signal , than the population for the off - resonant excitation via more intense pulses .",
    "also the amount of population excited in the qw rises linearly with the pulse intensity for off - resonant excitation , while it shows a marked saturation behavior under resonant excitation . in order to test whether the power law changes for smaller intensities",
    "our numerical simulation allows us to repeat the same analysis analyzing the transmitted field which has a lower level of background noise .",
    "we observe a crossover from @xmath85 for low intensities , to @xmath86 at higher intensities .",
    "we find that the minimum intensity for which an exponent different from 3 is obtained is @xmath87 .",
    "we have also checked that the crossover position is independent of the dephasing time . because of this and the correlation with the density of carriers in the qw , we attribute the change of the power law exponent @xmath81 to the presence of optically excited carriers and to the saturation of the total density in the semiconductor .",
    "in summary , we have studied the emergence of third harmonic signals in semiconductor quantum wells ( qw ) , photo - excited by intense femtosecond optical pusles . for this",
    ", we have introduced a general model combining a full time and space dependent finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) description of the light field , i.e. , a discretization of maxwell s equations without the inherent limitations of the slowly - varying envelope approximation , with a wave - vector resolved many level and many - body density matrix approach for the charge carrier dynamics . for a qw embedded in a homogeneous background we studied the interplay of light field dynamics and carrier dynamics , demonstrating the emergence of non - linear optical effects such as third harmonic generation ( thg ) .",
    "we further analyzed the intensity dependence of the generated non - linear response for a qw embedded in a many - layer semiconductor saturable absorber mirror ( sesam ) structure and show that the intensity dependence of the thg signal strongly varies with excitation frequency .",
    "for an excitation well below the band gap of the qw , we found that the intensity of the thg signal follows a cubic dependence on the intensity of the exciting pulse .",
    "this is in direct agreement with a description based on an expansion in powers of the field with non - linear susceptibilities as constant coefficients . for a resonant excitation at the excitonic frequency",
    ", however , the intensity dependence still follows a power - law , now with an exponent that is reduced to @xmath84 , clearly deviating from the cubic behavior .",
    "although a non - cubic dependence can also be obtained with a more phenomenological approach of an intensity dependent @xmath83 coefficient,@xcite this can only be fit to existing data rather than emerge from a more fundamental model . the simultaneous description of the light field and carrier dynamics not only allows for a deeper understanding of non - linear optical effects but is also readily expandable to other 2-dimensional semiconductor systems such as graphene , transition metal dichalcogenides@xcite or more complex structures like combined plasmonic - semiconductor structures.@xcite",
