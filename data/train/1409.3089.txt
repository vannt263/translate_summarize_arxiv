    "quantum field theories of gravity are nonrenormalizable by power counting feynman diagrams .",
    "this leads to the widely held belief that all unitary gravity field theories must be ultraviolet divergent at some loop order .",
    "indeed , no known symmetry is powerful enough to render such theories ultraviolet finite . on the other hand , recent years",
    "have made it abundantly clear that scattering amplitudes contain hidden symmetries and new structures beyond those expected from lagrangians .",
    "while these are not yet fully understood , they can have profound consequences on ultraviolet properties .    in this paper",
    ", we identify a new class of multiloop ultraviolet cancellations that go beyond the ones established by standard - symmetry arguments .",
    "we call these _ enhanced ultraviolet cancellations_. these are defined as cancellations that can not be displayed term - by - term in any local covariant diagrammatic formalism . by such a formalism",
    "we mean that the poles in the diagram integrands are simply the standard feynman propagator ones . using the maximal cut conditions , as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can identify terms unique to a given diagram which we can then power count . to illustrate enhanced cancellations , we use previous three- and four - loop calculations in @xmath1 supergravity  @xcite , as well as new calculations in @xmath0 supergravity performed here .",
    "the study of the ultraviolet properties of gravity theories has a rich history , starting with the seminal work of t  hooft and veltman  @xcite .",
    "they showed that pure einstein gravity is finite at one loop , but divergent with the addition of matter , a point on which other papers elaborated as well  @xcite . goroff and sagnotti later showed that at two loops , pure einstein gravity diverges  @xcite . with the addition of supersymmetry",
    ", the ultraviolet behavior tends to improve : pure ungauged supergravities are known to have no divergences prior to three loops  @xcite .",
    "however , the consensus reached from studies in the 1980s was that all supergravity theories would likely diverge at the third loop order ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , though one can raise the loop order with additional assumptions  @xcite .",
    "the complexity of gravity theories makes it difficult to explicitly check these expectations .",
    "this situation was ameliorated by the advent of the unitarity method  @xcite , which makes it possible to directly determine ultraviolet properties of gravity theories at high loop orders .",
    "more recently , a new constraint on gauge - theory and gravity amplitudes has been introduced  the duality between color and kinematics found by carrasco , johansson and one of the authors ( bcj )  @xcite  allowing additional new nontrivial computations to be carried out .    for maximally supersymmetric supergravity ( in @xmath4 this is @xmath5 supergravity )  @xcite ,",
    "explicit calculations show that four - point amplitudes are finite at three loops for dimensions @xmath6",
    "@xcite and at four loops for dimensions @xmath7  @xcite . in @xmath4 ,",
    "these ultraviolet cancellations were subsequently understood to follow from supersymmetry and the @xmath8 duality symmetry of @xmath5 supergravity  @xcite . a purely supersymmetric explanation has also been developed by bjrnsson and green  @xcite using a field - theory version of the berkovits pure spinor formalism  @xcite .",
    "the current consensus based on symmetry considerations is that a @xmath9 counterterm is valid under all standard symmetries , leading to the expectations of a seven - loop divergence in @xmath4 and a five - loop divergence in @xmath10 .",
    "while technical difficulties have prevented the @xmath5 supergravity expectations from being confronted by calculation , there is now evidence that implies even better behavior in this case than that suggested by standard - symmetry arguments : similar argumentation in half - maximal supergravity leads to predictions of valid counterterms in cases where no divergences exist . in particular , at three loops , half - maximal @xmath1 supergravity  @xcite is ultraviolet finite in four dimensions  @xcite , while similar supersymmetry and duality - symmetry considerations suggest that it should diverge  @xcite .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for string - theory arguments for finiteness . ) in addition , half - maximal pure supergravity in @xmath11 is ultraviolet finite at two loops , again contrary to symmetry considerations  @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether it is possible that the observed three - loop finiteness of @xmath1 supergravity in @xmath4 can be explained using only arguments based on supersymmetry and duality symmetry .",
    "an attempt to find such an explanation relied on the assumption of the existence of an appropriate non - lorentz covariant off - shell 16-supercharge superspace  @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the assumption carries other consequences as well : in particular , it predicts additional finiteness conditions when matter multiplets are added  @xcite that directly contradict subsequent explicit calculations  @xcite .",
    "three - loop finiteness of pure @xmath1 supergravity therefore remains unexplained by standard - symmetry arguments .",
    "nevertheless , it remains a key problem to understand the extent to which such arguments can restrict divergences .    to carry out further probes of the ultraviolet properties of supergravity theories , together with smirnov and smirnov , we recently computed the four - loop four - point divergence of @xmath1 supergravity in @xmath4  @xcite , finding that the theory does diverge at four loops .",
    "naively , this might suggest that all supergravity theories should diverge at some sufficiently high loop order .",
    "however , when one looks at the details of the divergence , a rather different picture emerges : the divergence appears to be tied to the duality - symmetry anomaly of @xmath1 supergravity found by marcus  @xcite .",
    "the consequences of the anomaly on the amplitudes of @xmath1 supergravity have been described in some detail in ref .",
    "the role of the anomaly implies that divergences of this type should not exist in @xmath12 supergravity , since these theories have no such analogous anomalies .    in this paper",
    ", we identify a subset of terms in @xmath5 supergravity that are ultraviolet divergent in four dimensions at seven loops , reproducing the analysis of bjrnsson and green  @xcite from a different perspective .",
    "to identify irreducible terms with poor power counting , we use maximal cuts .",
    "the expectation of a seven - loop divergence is also consistent with other standard - symmetry arguments  @xcite .",
    "a key question is whether there are nontrivial enhanced cancellations between the divergent terms that then make the amplitude as a whole ultraviolet finite .",
    "unfortunately , the high required loop order makes it unfeasible at present to test for the existence of enhanced cancellations in @xmath5 supergravity . instead",
    ", here we demonstrate the presence of enhanced cancellations in @xmath1 and @xmath0 supergravities , since they are easier to work with , because the required loop order is lower .",
    "as we demonstrate in this paper , enhanced cancellations are responsible for making the four - point @xmath1 supergravity amplitudes finite at three loops and @xmath0 supergravity amplitudes finite at four loops .",
    "we also demonstrate three - loop cancellations in four - point @xmath0 supergravity amplitudes beyond those needed for finiteness .",
    "such cancellations are reminiscent of the types of nontrivial cancellations noticed in certain unitarity cuts  @xcite .",
    "the surprising aspect is that no covariant local diagrammatic representation can make these results manifest .",
    "what might be behind enhanced ultraviolet cancellations ? in a previous paper with huang  @xcite , using the duality between color and kinematics , we explicitly tied the enhanced cancellations at two loops in half - maximal supergravity in @xmath11 to corresponding cancellations in pure yang - mills theory that prevent forbidden color factors from appearing in divergences .",
    "a key feature is that the ultraviolet cancellations occur between the planar and nonplanar sectors of the theory .",
    "this case is particularly simple to analyze in detail because the supergravity amplitudes are simple linear combinations of yang - mills amplitudes even after integration .",
    "unfortunately , the situation beyond two loops is much more complex because different sets of integrals appear in the supergravity case than in the corresponding gauge - theory case .    to carry out our computations",
    ", we use the same techniques as those used for three and four loops  @xcite in @xmath1 supergravity .",
    "our computations make use of the many advances in constructing integrands , including the unitarity method  @xcite and the duality between color and kinematics  @xcite . while nonplanar integrands can not be uniquely defined , they can still be integrated to obtain unique results .",
    "once the integrands are constructed , a mass is introduced as an infrared regulator",
    ". we then series expand in small external momenta ( or equivalently large loop momenta ) to focus on ultraviolet singularities  @xcite . at four loops the resulting vacuum integrals",
    "are nontrivial .",
    "to deal with them we use fire5  @xcite , which implements the laporta algorithm  @xcite , to reduce the integrals to a basis set .",
    "the basis integrals are known since they are identical to those used in the evaluation of the four - loop qcd @xmath13 function  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in",
    ", we summarize the methods used to carry out the calculations .",
    "in , we review the results of standard - symmetry power counting and show that power counting maximal cuts gives identical results .",
    "then in , we exhibit the enhanced cancellations responsible for ultraviolet finiteness of @xmath1 supergravity at three loops  @xcite .",
    "we also present a new three - loop calculation in @xmath0 supergravity , pointing out that it too exhibits enhanced cancellations beyond those needed for ultraviolet finiteness . in",
    ", we demonstrate that the four - point amplitudes of @xmath0 supergravity are all ultraviolet finite and again display enhanced cancellations .",
    "we present our conclusions in .",
    "the duality between color and kinematics and the associated gravity double - copy property  @xcite make it simple to construct supergravity amplitudes once corresponding gauge - theory amplitudes are arranged into a form that makes the duality manifest .",
    "( for a review of this duality and its applications , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) at loop level the duality remains a conjecture , but we rely only on explicitly constructed forms of @xmath1 super - yang - mills amplitudes where the duality is manifest  @xcite .    the duality between color and kinematics is usually formulated via graphs with only cubic vertices .",
    "any @xmath14-loop @xmath15-point gauge - theory amplitude with all particles in the color - adjoint representation can be written in terms of such graphs as @xmath16 the sum labeled by @xmath17 runs over the set of distinct non - isomorphic graphs , while the sum over @xmath18 is over all @xmath19 permutations of external legs .",
    "the symmetry factor @xmath20 removes over - counts arising from automorphisms of the diagrams .",
    "the product in the denominator runs over all feynman propagators of graph @xmath17 , and the integrals are over @xmath14 independent @xmath21-dimensional loop momenta .",
    "the color factor @xmath22 of graph @xmath17 is given by dressing every three - vertex with a group - theory structure constant , @xmath23 , while @xmath24 is the kinematic numerator of graph @xmath17 depending on momenta , polarizations and spinors .",
    "so far this representation involves nothing more than absorbing contact - term contributions into graphs with only cubic vertices by multiplying and dividing by appropriate propagators .",
    "the nontrivial part is the all - loop - order conjecture that there exists a form of gauge - theory amplitudes where kinematic numerators satisfy the same algebraic relations as color factors .",
    "these are known as bcj representations of amplitudes . for the theories we discuss in this paper ,",
    "this amounts to imposing the same jacobi identities on the kinematic numerators as those satisfied by adjoint - representation color factors : @xmath25 where the indices @xmath26 denote the diagram to which the color factors and numerators belong .",
    "the basic jacobi identity is illustrated in embedded in an arbitrary diagram .",
    "the numerator factors are also required to have the same antisymmetry properties as color factors . in general , the duality relations ( [ bcjduality ] )",
    "work only after appropriate nontrivial rearrangements of the amplitudes .",
    "remarkably , we can obtain corresponding gravity loop integrands simply by replacing color factors in a gauge - theory amplitude by kinematic numerators of a second gauge - theory amplitude where the duality is manifest  @xcite : @xmath27 putting in the appropriate gravitational coupling gives us the double - copy form of gravity amplitudes , @xmath28 only one of the two sets of numerators @xmath24 or @xmath29 needs to satisfy the duality relation ( [ bcjduality ] )  @xcite .",
    "we note that at tree level ( @xmath30 ) , the duality encodes the kawai - lewellen - tye  @xcite relations between gauge - theory and gravity amplitudes , as well as nontrivial relations between color - ordered gauge - theory partial amplitudes  @xcite .      in this paper",
    "we construct the three- and four - loop four - point @xmath0 supergravity integrands using the procedure presented above .",
    "we do so by starting with an @xmath31 super - yang - mills integrand and then replacing the color factors with the bcj forms of kinematic numerators of @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory given in refs .",
    "similar constructions of less - than - maximal supergravity amplitudes are found in refs .",
    "we express @xmath32 where `` sugra '' and `` sym '' are shorthands for , respectively , supergravity and super - yang - mills theory .",
    "we further decompose the @xmath0 amplitudes into a direct sum , @xmath33 where `` @xmath34 '' refers to ordinary pure nonsupersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "the first term in the direct sum is the pure @xmath1 supergravity amplitude , while the second term is the difference between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 supergravity amplitudes .",
    "the second term comes from taking the diagrams of pure @xmath31 super - yang - mills , subtracting out the pure - gluon part , and then replacing the color factors with the bcj numerators of @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory . on the @xmath31 super - yang - mills side",
    ", this amounts to separating the pure gluon contributions from the contributions including also gluinos .    following refs .",
    "@xcite , we use ordinary feynman diagrams for the @xmath35 and @xmath31 super - yang - mills integrands .",
    "while this might seem to be a poor starting point given the complexity of such diagrams , the bcj construction ( [ doublecopy ] ) ensures that only a small fraction of diagrams actually contribute .",
    "whenever an @xmath1 super - yang - mills diagram vanishes , we do not need to evaluate corresponding diagrams in @xmath35 or @xmath31 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "at one , two , three and four loops , the bcj - satisfying representations of the four - point amplitudes of @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory have only , respectively , 1 , 2 , 12 and 85 nonvanishing diagrams ( up to permutations of external legs ) . this is already a remarkable simplification , allowing the calculation to proceed .",
    "the decomposition in eq .",
    "results in an integrand where the @xmath1 supersymmetry cancellations are manifest , but the @xmath31 ones are not . while we do not do so here",
    ", one could simplify the @xmath0 supergravity integrand to make cancellations from all supersymmetries manifest .",
    "this could be accomplished by using the unitarity method to systematically move terms between diagrams , subject to maintaining the unitarity cuts . however , as we shall see below , no covariant local representation exists either in @xmath1 or @xmath0 supergravity that makes manifest the complete set of ultraviolet cancellations that we find .",
    "because of this , there is no obvious way to avoid direct integration to see the cancellations .",
    "we consequently call such cancellations enhanced .",
    "once we have an integrand , the next step is to extract the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "the procedure that we use has been described in some detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , so here we only briefly summarize it . to deal with potential ultraviolet divergences we use dimensional reduction  @xcite . rather than evaluate integrals with their full momentum dependence ,",
    "it is much simpler to series expand the integrands prior to integration in order to pick up only the desired ultraviolet divergences  @xcite .",
    "this procedure introduces new unphysical infrared singularities beyond the standard ones , so one needs an infrared cutoff to separate the ultraviolet divergences from the infrared ones .",
    "an especially good choice for regulating infrared singularities is to introduce a uniform mass into all feynman propagators prior to expanding in external momenta  @xcite .",
    "for the cases we study in this paper , where there are no lower - loop divergences , the subdivergences should all cancel amongst themselves with the use of this regulator .",
    "the uniform mass regulator therefore greatly simplifies the computation since we do not need to compute subdivergences .",
    "we have , however , performed extensive checks confirming that they cancel as expected .",
    "we note that if the mass regulator were introduced later in the calculation , for example after the expansion in external momenta and tensor integral simplifications , it would ruin the cancellations of subdivergences between different integrals .",
    "one would then need to include all subdivergence subtractions to properly remove the regulator dependence , greatly complicating the calculation .",
    "the procedure results in a large number of vacuum integrals . at three loops , evaluating the integrals is straightforward  @xcite , but at four loops it is a more serious challenge . to deal with this , we use the fire5 program  @xcite , which is a highly - efficient implementation of integration - by - parts relations @xcite using the laporta algorithm  @xcite .",
    "it allows us to write down any given integral as a linear combination of a small number of so - called master integrals . in our four - loop calculation , the reduction to master integrals is especially nontrivial due to the high powers of numerator loop momenta that occur in gravity .",
    "earlier related calculations already determined the four - loop vacuum master integrals  @xcite ; we use the master - integral basis and values given in ref .  @xcite .",
    ".selected valid counterterms based on supersymmetry and duality - symmetry considerations  @xcite .",
    "@xmath36 is the number of supercharges . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the restrictions supersymmetry and duality symmetry impose on counterterms have been studied in great detail over the years .",
    "the most recent power - counting predictions based on symmetry considerations are collected in . in @xmath4 , apparently valid counterterms exist at loop orders @xmath37 in @xmath5 supergravity  @xcite , @xmath38 in @xmath1 supergravity  @xcite , and @xmath39 in @xmath0 supergravity  @xcite . by increasing the space - time dimensions , one can also lower the loop order at which a potential counterterm can correspond to a divergence .",
    "for example , in @xmath10 , maximal 32-supercharge supergravity has a valid five - loop counterterm  @xcite .",
    "similarly , half - maximal 16-supercharge supergravity in @xmath11 has an apparently valid two - loop counterterm  @xcite . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the counterterms listed in can not be written as full - superspace integrals , but they do appear to be valid under all known standard - symmetry considerations .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for an attempt to put tighter restrictions on the counterterms and the associated difficulties with doing so .",
    "bjrnsson and green  @xcite constructed a first - quantized pure spinor formalism useful for power counting .",
    "their formalism exposes all supersymmetry cancellations and gives an identical power count as other recent methods , including those that account for duality symmetry  @xcite .",
    "their results imply that unless there are some extra nonstandard cancellations beyond those implied by supersymmetry , @xmath5 supergravity will diverge at five loops in @xmath10 and at seven loops in @xmath4 , corresponding to the first and fourth rows of . we know that through four loops in @xmath5 supergravity , such symmetry - based predictions match the explicitly computed critical dimensions where a divergence first appears  @xcite .",
    "a key question is whether this pattern continues or whether there are cancellations beyond the well - understood ones .    while it is not currently feasible to answer this for @xmath5 supergravity , we can answer it for @xmath1 and @xmath0 supergravity . from previous work  @xcite",
    ", we already know that the three - loop @xmath40 counterterm of @xmath1 supergravity in @xmath4 listed on the second row of does _ not _ result in a three - loop divergence .",
    "similarly , half - maximal 16-supercharge supergravity at two loops in @xmath11 is free of divergences  @xcite . as we discuss below in some detail for the three - loop @xmath1 case , these cancellations are a nontrivial manifestation of enhanced cancellations . however , one may worry that these two cases are special and not representative of a general pattern .",
    "in particular , @xmath1 supergravity in @xmath4 has a @xmath41 anomaly  @xcite that would not occur in theories with higher supersymmetry .",
    "the two - loop @xmath11 case also has some special features : at two loops the bcj kinematic numerators of maximally supersymmetric yang - mills four - point amplitudes are independent of loop momenta , implying that half - maximal supergravity amplitudes are simple linear combinations of the corresponding pure yang - mills ones . to go beyond these special cases , here",
    "we study the case of @xmath0 supergravity in @xmath4 to show that there is no divergence associated with the counterterm listed on the third line of .",
    "this case is not entangled with any known anomaly .",
    "furthermore , unlike the two - loop case , the kinematic numerators do depend on loop momenta , so the gravity integrals are different from the corresponding yang - mills ones .      in order to describe the phenomenon of enhanced cancellations",
    ", we turn to power counting using maximal cuts .",
    "the terms selected by a maximal cut are a gauge - invariant set that are unique to a diagram . using maximal cuts",
    ", we can incorporate all supersymmetric cancellations into supergravity power counts using the known power counts of super - yang - mills theories . because all supersymmetric cancellations are accounted for ,",
    "this gives us a power - counting method equivalent to the one of bjrnsson and green  @xcite .",
    "the maximal cut of a given diagram is obtained by replacing all propagators with on - shell conditions .",
    "while the cut conditions set various terms to zero , they do allow us to identify terms with poor behavior , in some cases worse behavior than that of the full amplitude .",
    "once we have selected terms using the maximal cuts , we promote them back to feynman integrals , making sure that the obtained representation has the _ minimum power count _ consistent with the cut .",
    "if any term is then found whose ultraviolet behavior is worse than that of the amplitude as a whole , then by definition , we have enhanced cancellations .",
    "of course , some care is required to be sure that we are using a form that has minimum power count but is also consistent with the cut . to be clear",
    ", we are defining enhanced cancellations entirely by their integrand power - counting properties and not by cancellations that appear only after integration .",
    "we do the power counting in @xmath21 dimensions , viewing @xmath21 as arbitrarily large , to not include hidden relations in the cut solutions that might lead to extra cancellations . in this way we maintain @xmath21-dimensional covariance .",
    "we will show that the maximal cuts give power counts equivalent to the potential counterterms in .",
    "this should not be too surprising given that the maximal cuts are a gauge - invariant subset built from objects that respect all standard symmetries of the amplitudes .",
    "as with other power counts , the maximal cuts do not make enhanced cancellations visible because they do not account for nontrivial cancellations between diagrams .",
    "indeed , at a sufficiently high loop order , the amplitudes of _ every _ supergravity theory necessarily have divergences in individual terms selected by the maximal cuts . to see a better behavior in unitarity cuts , one needs to instead look at cuts that collect together many diagrams so as to allow cancellations between them .",
    "the cuts analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite suggesting improved all - loop behavior of the amplitudes are examples of this .",
    ".5 cm    as a warm - up , we first consider maximal cuts in @xmath5 supergravity .",
    "we consider the diagram in ( a ) as a simple first example . in @xmath5 supergravity",
    ", a kinematic numerator consistent with the maximal cuts is given by  @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the four - point gravity tree amplitude , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the standard four - point mandelstam invariants .",
    "the maximal - cut conditions have no effect on this numerator since it is independent of loop momentum .",
    "counting the three @xmath21-dimensional loop integrals , no powers of loop momentum in the numerator , and ten propagators gives us the power count , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "the critical dimension where an ultraviolet divergence first occurs is thus @xmath48 for the maximal - cut terms of this diagram .",
    "however , the @xmath5 three - loop amplitude also contains worse - behaved terms .",
    "we consider instead the diagram in ( b ) . in @xmath5 supergravity",
    ", a kinematic numerator consistent with the unitarity cuts of this diagram is given in ref .",

    "counting the three @xmath21-dimensional loop integrals , two powers of loop momentum in the numerator , and ten propagators gives us an overall power count for the diagram of @xmath52 the critical dimension of this contribution is thus @xmath53 , which matches the critical dimension obtained from explicit divergence calculations  @xcite . in this case then , there are no enhanced cancellations .",
    ".5 cm -.2 cm    next we consider the maximal cut of the five - loop diagram in ( a ) .",
    "the simplest numerator consistent with the diagram s maximal cut in @xmath5 supergravity is @xmath54 where the momenta follow the labels of ( a ) .",
    "the numerator follows from the rung rule  @xcite  a rule devised to give the correct iterated two - particle cuts  after dropping terms that vanish with the on - shell conditions @xmath55 .",
    "promoting the maximal - cut terms back to numerators of a feynman integral , we have five @xmath21-dimensional loop integrals and sixteen propagators . together with the numerator ( [ fiveloopnumerator ] )",
    ", we then have a power count , @xmath56 this gives a critical dimension @xmath57 , matching the bjrnsson and green analysis  @xcite .",
    "after stepping through the diagrams , this turns out to be the worst - behaved contribution . if it were to turn out that the critical dimension of the full amplitude is greater than @xmath58 , then by definition there would be enhanced ultraviolet cancellations .",
    "similarly , we go through the same exercise for the seven - loop diagram shown in ( b ) . in this case ,",
    "the simplest form of the numerator consistent with the maximal cuts is @xmath59 together with seven @xmath21-dimensional loop integrations and 22 propagators , we obtain the power count , @xmath60 thus , the critical dimension is @xmath61 , again in agreement with other power - counting methods  @xcite .    while it is not yet technically feasible to directly study the enhanced cancellations in @xmath5 supergravity five- and seven - loop amplitudes , we are able to study them in @xmath1 and @xmath0 supergravities .",
    "we therefore turn to power counting in these theories .",
    "consider @xmath1 supergravity at three loops .",
    "as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bcj construction of the integrand is in terms of the 12 diagrams displayed in . to be concrete ,",
    "we examine diagram ( a ) in for @xmath1 supergravity .",
    "the maximal - cut conditions on the kinematic invariants are @xmath62 applying these and taking the explicit expression for the numerator of ( a ) in @xmath1 supergravity obtained by the double - copy procedure , we obtain @xmath63 where we kept only those term with the largest powers of loop momenta .",
    "the momentum labels are the ones shown in the figure and @xmath64 is an @xmath1 super - yang - mills tree amplitude depending only on the external states and momenta .",
    "the @xmath65 are polarization vectors of gluons .",
    "as discussed in , the pure @xmath1 supergravity states are just the direct product of states of the two gauge theories .",
    "the displayed term in is irreducible in that its power count can not be lowered by imposing the maximal - cut conditions ( [ maxcuts ] ) . since the term ( [ diagramanumerator ] ) is uniquely assigned to the diagram , it is a lower bound on the power count of the diagram . after including the three @xmath21-dimensional loop integrals , eight powers of numerator loop momentum and ten propagators",
    ", we obtain a power - counting for this diagram , @xmath66 thus , in @xmath4 this diagram has divergent terms . as a direct confirmation of this power count",
    ", we integrated the irreducible numerator in after putting back the propagators .",
    "indeed , it is ultraviolet divergent as indicated from the power count .",
    "this power count agrees with the one based on standard - symmetry arguments  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "explicit calculations show that the three - loop four - point @xmath1 supergravity amplitude is finite  @xcite .",
    "given that there are divergent terms in ( a ) that can only cancel against terms that were set to zero by the maximal cut conditions or terms from other diagrams , the finiteness of the amplitude as a whole is a prime example of an enhanced cancellation .",
    "the maximal - cut constraints can sometimes lower the power count of diagrams below their true critical dimension .",
    "for example , for the diagram in ( b ) , under the maximal - cut conditions , all @xmath67 can be made to be no worse than linear in loop momenta . by choosing the minimal resulting power count , this results in an integrand that is ultraviolet finite , even after including an extra power of loop momentum from the @xmath1 super - yang - mills side of the double copy .",
    "another point is that after integration , it may be possible to combine terms even from a single diagram to get a finite result . in particular",
    ", one can imagine taking the numerator of and combining it with a judiciously chosen set of terms that vanish on the cuts to cancel the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "however , this is not relevant for enhanced cancellations which are defined in terms of power counting individual terms at the integrand level .",
    "if even a single term in the integrand of a single diagram has a worse power count compared to the actual behavior of the full amplitude and the power count can not be lowered by maximal - cut conditions , then we have identified enhanced cancellations .",
    "we also note that , by using spinor - helicity , we can set the integrated divergence resulting from the diagram in ( a ) to zero ( i.e. , the integration results in terms containing @xmath68 that can be set to zero by special reference momentum choices ) .",
    "indeed , we shall do so later to simplify various tables . of course",
    ", this does not change the fact that there is a term in the integrand that has a worse power count than the amplitude as a whole that can not be set to zero .",
