    "as soon as quantum correlations @xcite have been recognized as a resource for quantum information processing , it has been realized that decoherence is the main obstacle to overcome in order to effectively implement quantum technologies .",
    "decoherence appears whenever a system interacts with its environment , so that its dynamics is no longer unitary , but rather described by a non unitary completely positive quantum map , irreversibly driving the system towards relaxation and the loss of quantum coherence @xcite .",
    "the main effect of the interaction with environment is to set up a time scale @xmath0 over which the dynamics of the system is effectively described by a coarse grained markovian process towards equilibrium .",
    "conversely , for times shorter than @xmath1 , the dynamics is more involved and the correlations with and within the environment play a major role @xcite . in this regime , decoherence may be less detrimental , and the dynamics may even induce _ re - coherence _ :",
    "this is why a great attention has been devoted to the study of the corresponding _ non - markovian _ maps , e.g. in different continuous variable systems ranging from quantum optics to mechanical oscillators and harmonic lattices @xcite . besides , there are evidences that non - markovian open quantum systems @xcite can be useful for quantum technologies @xcite . as a consequence , much attention",
    "is currently devoted to the analysis of system - environment coupling in order to characterize , control , and possibly reduce decoherence in the most effective way @xcite , e.g. by taking advantage of the back - flow of information from the environment .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "non - markovian models are usually more involved than the corresponding markovian ones , and only few cases can be solved analytically @xcite",
    ". however , these cases are also of great interest , since they display a rich phenomenology which is relevant for practical implementations .",
    "this is especially true for continuous variable systems @xcite , where considering a set of quantum oscillators excited in a gaussian state , and then linearly interacting with their thermal environment , provides an excellent model for a large class of physical systems in order to study non - markovianity and the decoherence of quantum correlations .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we address in details the dynamics of quantum correlations between two quantum oscillators each interacting with a local thermal environment .",
    "we assume a weak coupling between the oscillators and the corresponding environment , as well as the validity of the secular approximation approximation .",
    "these are the minimal assumptions to have a model that displays remarkable differences between markovian and non markovian dynamics and , at the same time , allows the use of analytic tools to describe results .",
    "we also assume the oscillators initially prepared in a symmetric gaussian state , and study in details the evolution of their quantum correlations as described by their dynamical paths , i.e. the time evolution in a suitably chosen parameter space .",
    "we start by noticing that the set of gaussian states , i.e. states with a gaussian wigner function @xcite , do not constitute a manifold , nor it is convex , and thus geometrical approaches to their dynamics are not considered particularly appealing . at variance with this belief , we address the study of decoherence by representing dynamical paths in a suitable , overcomplete , parameter space , involving gaussian entanglement ( negativity ) @xcite , gaussian discord @xcite and the overall purity of the state .",
    "the use of these variables offers a suitable framework to compare non - markovian maps and their markovian counterparts , and to show which properties do , and _ notably do not _ , distinguish markovian and non - markovian processes . in particular , upon describing the dynamics as a path in the three - dimensional space individuated by the above variables , we observe _ universality _ : the dynamical paths do not depend on the specific features of the environment spectrum and are determined only by the initial state and the effective temperature of the environment .",
    "the non - markovianity of the system only changes the velocity of running over a given path .",
    "this behavior allows one to map non - markovian processes onto markovian ones and it may reduce the number of parameters needed to study a dynamical process , e.g. it may be exploited to build constants of motion valid for both markovian and non - markovian maps .",
    "universality is also observed in the value of discord at the separability threshold , which moreover is a function of the sole initial conditions in the limit of high temperature . finally , we find that the geometrical constraints provided by the structure of the parameter space implies the existence of excluded regions , i.e. sets of states which can not be linked by any gaussian dynamical map .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the interaction model and briefly review its solution for gaussian states .",
    "we also introduce symmetric gaussian states and the quantities used to quantify their quantum correlations , i.e. gaussian entanglement and gaussian discord .",
    "the dynamics of the system is then described in details in both the markovian and the non markovian regimes , illustrating universality of the dynamical paths .",
    "section iii closes the paper with some concluding discussions and remarks .",
    "here we consider the dynamical decoherence of two oscillators of frequency @xmath2 , each coupled to its own bosonic environment made of modes at frequencies @xmath3 .",
    "the baths are separated and of equal structure ( see @xcite for the interaction with a common bath ) .",
    "the system - bath interaction hamiltonian is given by ( we use natural units ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the coupling , the complex @xmath6 modulate the dispersion over the bath s modes , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the canonical operators of the systems and baths modes respectively , i.e. @xmath10=\\delta_{ss^\\prime}$ ] , @xmath8 and @xmath11=\\delta_{kk^\\prime}$ ] . in the weak coupling limit @xmath12 and performing the secular approximation we can write a non - markovian time - local master equation for the dynamical evolution of the density operator @xmath13 describing the quantum state of the two oscillators in the interaction picture @xcite @xmath14 \\notag \\\\ & -i\\gamma(t)\\,[x_k,\\{p_k,\\varrho ( t)\\ } ] \\big ) \\label{eq : hupazme}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 denote commutator and anticommutator between the operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 . upon defining the spectrum of environment as @xmath19 the diffusion ( heating ) and dissipation ( damping ) coefficients are given by @xcite : @xmath20 respectively , with @xmath21 .",
    "at high temperatures the damping coefficient @xmath22 is negligible and the diffusion @xmath23 is dominant , while at lower temperatures they have the same order of magnitude .",
    "it is worth noticing that the assumptions of weak coupling and secular approximation are the minimal ones to have a model that displays differences between markovian and non markovian dynamics . at the same time",
    "the dynamical equations remain simple enough to allow the use of analytic tools to describe results .",
    "in fact , the master equation ( [ eq : hupazme ] ) may be transformed into a differential equation for the two - mode symmetrically ordered characteristic function associated with the density operator @xmath13 @xcite @xmath24 % \\qquad \\boldsymbol \\lambda = % ( \\lambda_1,\\lambda_2 ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , is the displacement operator and @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the solution of this equation may be written as follows @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the characteristic function at time @xmath31 and @xmath32 the corresponding quantity at @xmath33 .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 represents an effective time - dependent damping factor , given by @xmath35 the @xmath36 matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 @xmath40 finally , @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 gaussian states have gaussian characteristic function and they are fully characterized by the mean values of the canonical operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 and by the covariance matrix ( cm ) @xmath46 , that writes @xmath47,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath48 . since the gaussian character of an input state is preserved by the master equation ( [ eq : hupazme ] ) , and we are considering gaussian states , we need to address the sole evolution of the first two moments .",
    "in addition , we can focus attention to the evolution of the cm only , being the quantum correlations independent of the first moments .",
    "in particular , we assume that the initial state is a two - mode gaussian state @xmath49 with zero amplitude , i.e. @xmath50 = \\hbox{tr}[\\varrho_0\\ , p_k]=0 $ ] , @xmath51 , and with covariance matrix @xmath52 . according to eq .",
    "( [ chit ] ) the evolved state at time @xmath31 is still a gaussian state with zero mean values , and with covariance matrix given by @xcite @xmath53 upon retaining only the terms consistent with the secular approximation we arrive at the expression @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a time - dependent effective diffusion factor .",
    "the non - markovian features are embodied in the time dependence of the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath34 , which describes diffusion and damping respectively . for times",
    "@xmath57 both coefficients are strongly influenced by the whole spectrum of the environment @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for times @xmath58 the coefficients achieve their markovian limiting values .",
    "in particular we have @xmath59 such that @xmath60 and the solution ( [ eq : nmsigma ] ) rewrites as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the cm of the stationary state , i.e. a thermal equilibrium state at temperature @xmath63 and , in turn , a population of @xmath64 thermal photons .",
    "a bipartite gaussian state is symmetric if its cm can be recast ( via local operations ) in a form depending on two real parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 , that is @xmath67 the @xmath68 s being pauli matrices .",
    "note that uncertainty relations impose a constraint which reads @xcite @xmath69 .",
    "the evolution under the master equation ( [ eq : hupazme ] ) preserves the symmetry [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : nmsigma ] ) ] , therefore the evolved cm at time @xmath31 may be still written as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "a symmetric cm of the form ( [ sym ] ) corresponds to prepare the two oscillators in a _ squeezed thermal state _ ( sts ) , i.e a state with density operator of the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes a single mode thermal state with @xmath76 photons and @xmath77 is the two - mode squeezing operator . for @xmath78",
    "the state @xmath79 reduces to the so - called two - mode squeezed vacuum state or _ twin - beam _ state , i.e. the maximally entangled state of two oscillators at fixed energy .",
    "the parameters of the cm are connected to the physical parameters as follows @xmath80 furthermore , by introducing the ( equal ) population ( mean photon number ) of the two subsystems @xmath81 the diagonal elements may be written as @xmath82 , while the @xmath66 coefficients describe the correlations among them .",
    "it is worth noting that _ any _ two - mode entangled gaussian state can be converted into a symmetric one by local operations and classical communication @xcite .",
    "therefore , our results about the dynamics of quantum correlations actually holds for more general initial states than the symmetric ones , including any initially entangled state .    indeed , the representation in terms of the coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath66 does not fully illustrate the correlation properties of a state . in particular , it does not allow to analyze the relations between different kinds of quantum correlations , as entanglement or discord , in a dynamical context , and to compare their robustness against dissipation and noise .",
    "to this aim we introduce a different ( overcomplete ) parametrization involving the overall purity of the state @xmath83 = \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{\\det \\sigma}}=\\frac{1}{(2\\nu_{\\scriptscriptstyle t}+1)^2}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] its gaussian entanglement expressed in terms of the minimum symplectic eigenvalue @xmath84 ( the state is separable iff @xmath85 ) and the gaussian quantum discord , which for symmetric gaussian states may be written as @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 the parameter space individuated by @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is overcomplete and the third parameter is a function of the other two @xcite at any time . in the following",
    ", we will describe the dynamics of the system by paths in the three - dimensional space @xmath91 according to the following definition : + @xmath92    * definition * ( dynamical path ) : _ a dynamical path for a symmetric gaussian state is a line in the three - dimensional space @xmath91 individuated by the overall purity of the state @xmath88 , its least symplectic eigenvalue @xmath89 , and its gaussian discord @xmath90 . _",
    "+ @xmath92    dynamical paths lay on the surface individuated by the constraint ( [ eq : discord ] ) and in the region satisfying the uncertainty relations . in terms of the parameters",
    "@xmath91 these constraints correspond to @xmath93 a dynamical path describes the evolution of a symmetric gaussian state in a noisy gaussian channel with no explicit dependence on time .",
    "this allows one to compare non - markovian maps and their markovian counterparts , and to show which properties do , and do not , distinguish markovian and non- markovian processes . at the same time , it allows us to reveal the relationships among the different kinds of quantum correlations in a dynamical context .",
    "in other words , each dynamical path actually describes an equivalence class of dynamical time - dependent trajectories ( including both markovian and non - markovian ones ) , characterized by a specific dependence of the gaussian discord on the other two parameters .",
    "the markovian master equation depends on the ( effective ) environment temperature and on the damping @xmath94 , nonetheless the markovian dynamical paths depend exclusively on the ( effective ) temperature of the environment .",
    "the damping only affects the speed of running over a dynamical path , but not its shape , and the rate @xmath95 determines in a unique way the rate @xmath96 . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ f : path ] we show few markovian paths for different values of the temperature , assuming the two oscillators initially prepared in a two - mode squeezed vacuum ( twb ) @xmath97 , i.e a pure maximally entangled state of the two oscillators .",
    "as it is apparent from the plot , two limiting paths emerge at low and high temperatures .",
    "the transition from one regime to the other occurs continuously by raising the temperature , and we see that the high temperatures limit is already achieved for temperatures corresponding to @xmath98 two other phenomena are revealed by this representation : ( i ) the value of the discord at the separability threshold ( @xmath99 ) depends only on the initial squeezing @xmath100 and approaches a universal curve in the high temperature limit ; ( ii ) for a given initial state @xmath97 there are sts that can not be reached during any markovian decoherence process , despite the fact that they have reduced entanglement and purity compared to the initial state .      as mentioned in the introduction , non - markovian dynamics may display remarkable differences from their markovian counterpart during the initial transient when @xmath101 .",
    "entanglement oscillations may occur , and the separability threshold may be delayed or accelerated depending on the spectrum of the environment . a question thus arises on whether these differences also affect significantly the dynamical path in the space of parameters .",
    "as we will see , the answer is negative , and universality occurs .",
    "the results about the dynamics that we are going to discuss are independent of the particular choice of environment spectrum , and this is a crucial point of our analysis .",
    "however , in order to show some numerical solutions , we employ few examples corresponding to white noise and to both ohmic and super - ohmic spectral densities with cut - off @xmath102 .",
    "more specifically , we are going to consider ohmic spectrum @xmath103 which leads to non - markovian features when out of resonance , i.e. when @xmath104 , superohmic spectrum @xmath105 and white noise spectrum @xmath106 .",
    "let us start by analyzing the high temperature regime , where over a timescale @xmath107 we can neglect the damping @xmath34 ( it becomes relevant over times @xmath108 , which is definitely in the markovian regime ) .",
    "short time non - markovian dynamics is thus due to the behavior of the heating function @xmath56 and , in turn , is very sensitive to the details of the environment spectrum @xmath109 . in this limit",
    "non - markovian effects can be seen during the whole decoherence process , with entanglement oscillation across the separability threshold @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is driven by the approximate dynamical equation @xmath110 corresponding to @xmath111 the minimum symplectic eigenvalue is thus given by @xmath112 the condition @xmath113 imposes a constraint to the dynamical paths , which is the same independently on whether the dynamic of @xmath114 is markovian or displays oscillations , as long as @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "in other words , the paths are the same of the markovian case , and the possible oscillations of @xmath114 only influences the speed of running over the dynamical path . in the right panel of fig .  [",

    "we also report the values obtained from the full non - markovian solutions for different environment spectra and _ not so low _ temperature , i.e. @xmath134 . as it is apparent from the plot the two solutions are in excellent agreement and this may be understood as follows . at low temperatures the damping @xmath22 and the heating function @xmath23 become of the same order of magnitude and",
    "thus the separability threshold @xmath140 does depend on the environment spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "separability is always achieved in the markovian regime , and thus @xmath127 is a universal quantity .",
    "the plot confirms that this argument holds also if the temperature is not so low , i.e. for @xmath134 . for times",
    "@xmath101 , there is a competition between @xmath22 and @xmath23 and in principle , one would not expect a universal behavior .",
    "however , low temperature and weak coupling make the effect of damping and heating very weak , with appreciable perturbation of the initial state only after a long time . in other words ,",
    "any dynamical effect of the interaction is taking place in the markovian regime , thus re - gaining universality and independence on the environment spectrum .",
    "this also means that the dynamical paths in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ f : path ] legitimately describe non - markovian dynamical trajectories at low temperatures .",
    "any path - dependent property may be checked analytically using the set of markovian equations and then extended to the non - markovian regime , where an analytic approach would be unfeasible . in particular , let us introduce the rescaled time @xmath141 , and recall that in the markovian regime we have @xmath142\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where pedices @xmath143 refer to initial / stationary state .",

    "the temperature dependence disappears in the high - temperatures limit .",

    "dynamical paths describe the evolution of symmetric gaussian states with no explicit dependence on time .",

    "non markovianity manifests itself in the velocity of running over a given path .",
    "this phenomenon allows one to map non - markovian processes onto markovian ones and it may reduce the number of parameters needed to study a dynamical process , e.g. it may be exploited to build constants of motions valid for both markovian and non - markovian maps .",
    "universality is also observed for the value of discord at the separability threshold , which moreover depends on the sole initial squeezing in the high temperature limit .",
    "we also found that the geometrical constraints provided by the structure of the parameter space implies the existence of excluded regions , i.e. sets of gaussian states which can not be linked by any gaussian dynamical map , despite the fact that they have reduced entanglement and purity compared to the initial one .",
    "our results have been obtained for gaussian states and are not directly transferable to the non gaussian sector of the hilbert space .",
    "indeed , there are no necessary and sufficient criteria to individuate and quantify non gaussian entanglement , and there are no analytic formulas to evaluate non gaussian quantum discord .",
    "the interplay between gaussian and non gaussian quantum correlations has been discussed in the recent years @xcite , but a complete understanding has not yet been achieved .    finally , we emphasize once again that the universality of dynamical paths does not depend on the environment spectrum , i.e. it is a consequence of the sole assumptions of weak coupling and the linear interaction between system and environment .",
    "it may therefore be conjectured that universality represents a more general feature , characterizing any open quantum system admitting a markovian limit .",

    "<S> we address the dynamics of quantum correlations in continuous variable open systems and analyze the evolution of bipartite gaussian states in independent noisy channels . in particular , upon introducing the notion of _ dynamical path _ through a suitable parametrization for symmetric states , we focus attention on phenomena that are common to markovian and non - markovian gaussian maps under the assumptions of weak coupling and secular approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the dynamical paths in the parameter space are universal , that is they do depend only on the initial state and on the effective temperature of the environment , with non markovianity that manifests itself in the velocity of running over a given path . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon allows one to map non - markovian processes onto markovian ones and it may reduce the number of parameters needed to study a dynamical process , e.g. it may be exploited to build constants of motions valid for both markovian and non - markovian maps . </S>",
    "<S> universality is also observed in the value of gaussian discord at the separability threshold , which itself is a function of the sole initial conditions in the limit of high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove the existence of excluded regions in the parameter space , i.e. of sets of states which can not be linked by any gaussian dynamical map . </S>"
