    "<S> the injections of energetic hadrons could have occurred in the early universe by decays of hypothetical long - lived exotic particles . </S>",
    "<S> the injections induce the showers of nonthermal hadrons via nuclear scattering . </S>",
    "<S> neutrons generated at these events can react with @xmath0be nuclei and reduce @xmath0be abundance solving a problem of the primordial @xmath0li abundance . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that thermal neutron injection is a way to derive a model independent conservative limit on the relation between abundances of d and @xmath0li in a hadronic energy injection model . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that an uncertainty in cross sections of inelastic @xmath1 scattering affects the total number of induced neutrons , which determines final abundances of d and @xmath0li . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the annihilations of antinucleons with @xmath2he result in higher d abundance and trigger nonthermal @xmath3li production . it is concluded that a reduction of @xmath0li abundance from a value in the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) model down to an observational two @xmath4 upper limit is necessarily accompanied by an undesirable increase of d abundance up to at least an observational 12 @xmath4 upper limit from observations of quasi - stellar object absorption line systems . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of antinucleons and secondary particles produced in the hadronic showers always lead to a severer constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the bbn models involving any injections of extra neutrons are thus unlikely to reproduce a small @xmath0li abundance consistent with observations . </S>"
