    "the kondo effect is one of the most important and fundamental problems in condensed matter physics.@xcite when a localized spin contacts with the electron fermi sea , the many - body state of spin - singlet is locally formed at temperatures lower than the kondo temperature @xmath0 .",
    "an open problem in the kondo physics is the observation of the many - body state , so - called kondo screening cloud .",
    "the size of the screening cloud is evaluated as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fermi velocity .",
    "there have been several theoretical proposals for the observation of @xmath15,@xcite e.g. , the knight shift as a function of the distance from a magnetic impurity in metal,@xcite ring - size dependence of the persistent current in an isolated ring with an embedded quantum dot,@xcite the friedel oscillation around a magnetic impurity in metal,@xcite and the spin - spin correlation function.@xcite in the present paper , we theoretically examine the kondo effect in a quantum dot embedded in a mesoscopic ring to elucidate the effects of the formation of kondo screening cloud on the physical properties , based on the scaling analysis .    the kondo effect in quantum dots has been intensively studied in a conventional geometry in which a quantum dot connected to two external leads . at @xmath16 ,",
    "the current through the quantum dot shows a peak structure , so - called coulomb oscillation , when the electrostatic potential in the dot is changed by the gate voltage . between the current peaks , the number of electrons is almost fixed by the coulomb blockade . with an odd number of electrons , the tunnel coupling between a localized spin @xmath17 in the dot and conduction electrons in the leads results in the kondo effect at @xmath18 .",
    "the resonant tunneling of conduction electrons through the many - body kondo state enhances the conductance to of the order of @xmath19 at @xmath20.@xcite various aspects of the kondo effect has been elucidated in the quantum dot owing to its artificial tunability and flexibility , e.g. , an enhanced kondo effect with an even number of electrons at the spin - singlet - triplet degeneracy,@xcite the su(4 ) kondo effect with @xmath21 and orbital degeneracy,@xcite bonding and antibonding states between the kondo resonant levels in coupled quantum dots,@xcite and kondo effect in a quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads.@xcite    mesoscopic rings with an embedded quantum dot are also fabricated and being studied .",
    "the rings are connected to source and drain leads , which enables to examine the coherent transport through the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect .",
    "using the so - called ab interferometers , the transmission phase of an electron passing through a quantum dot was measured in the absence@xcite or presence of the kondo effect.@xcite without the kondo effect , the fano resonance of asymmetric shape with a peak and a dip is observed as a function of the gate voltage , which stems from the interference between a discrete level in the quantum dot and continuum spectrum in the ring.@xcite in the kondo regime , the one - body interference effect and many - body kondo effect coexist , which modifies the fano resonant shape with phase locking at @xmath22 due to the kondo many - body resonance .",
    "this fano - kondo effect was studied by several theoretical groups using a minimal model with a single energy level @xmath4 in the quantum dot and in the small limit of ring size,@xcite e.g. , using the equation - of - motion method with the green function,@xcite the numerical renormalization group method,@xcite the exact solution by the bethe ansatz,@xcite and the density - matrix renormalization group method.@xcite the character of the fano - kondo effect was reported by recent experiment.@xcite in the present paper , we concentrate on the kondo regime in this system .    in the ab interferometer in the kondo regime",
    ", the kondo screening cloud should be affected by the ab interference effect if the screening cloud is larger than the size of the ring .",
    "although the interference effect on the value of @xmath23 was studied by some groups,@xcite the magnetic - flux dependence of @xmath23 is still controversial . in our previous",
    "work,@xcite we studied this kondo problem in the small limit of ring size , using the `` poor man s '' scaling method.@xcite the scaling method is suitable for revealing the kondo physics in this system and obtaining analytical expressions of @xmath23 and conductance .",
    "our calculation method is as follows .",
    "first , we construct an equivalent model in which a quantum dot is coupled to a single lead .",
    "the ab interference effect is involved in the magnetic - flux dependence of the density of states in the lead .",
    "next , the two - stage scaling method@xcite is applied to the reduced model . on the first stage of scaling ,",
    "we renormalize the energy level in the quantum dot by taking into account the charge fluctuation in the dot . on the second stage ,",
    "the spin fluctuation is considered .",
    "the kondo temperature @xmath0 is evaluated as a function of magnetic flux penetrating the ring .",
    "we showed that @xmath0 is significantly modulated by the magnetic flux .",
    "the scaling method also yields the logarithmic corrections to the conductance at temperatures @xmath24 and an analytical expression of the conductance at @xmath25 .",
    "in the present work , we apply our calculation method to the kondo effect in the ab interferometer with finite size of the ring .",
    "there are two characteristic lengths in this problem .",
    "one is the screening length of the charge fluctuation , @xmath26 where @xmath4 is the energy level in the quantum dot .",
    "the other is the screening length of spin fluctuation , i.e. , size of the kondo screening cloud , @xmath27 in eq .",

    "@xmath0 is markedly modulated by @xmath1 in cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) , whereas it hardly depends on @xmath1 in case ( i ) .",
    "this result clearly indicates that the kondo screening cloud is modified by the ab interference effect when the ring size is smaller than @xmath28 .",
    "the conductance in analytical forms is also given for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    in our model",
    ", we consider a single energy level @xmath4 in the quantum dot .",
    "regarding the electron - electron interaction @xmath29 in the dot , two situations are examined .",
    "one is the case of @xmath30 and the other is in the vicinity of electron - hole symmetry , @xmath31 .",
    "the latter case corresponds to the midpoint between the current peaks in the coulomb blockade region . with approaching one of the current peaks ,",
    "the situation becomes similar to the case of @xmath30 .",
    "hence the two situations may be realized by changing the gate voltage in experiments .",
    "note that we can accurately evaluate the exponential part of @xmath0 by the `` poor man s '' scaling method,@xcite in extreme cases of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , etc .",
    "the conductance @xmath34 is properly estimated only for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "accurate evaluations of @xmath0 and @xmath34 in intermediate regimes require the calculations using the numerical renormalization group method , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we believe , however , that analytical expressions of @xmath0 and @xmath34 that we obtain in limited situations will importantly contribute to understanding the properties of the kondo screening cloud in mesoscopic rings .",
