    "a closer inspection of the theoretical modeling reveals differences in both macroscopic expansion scenarios and microscopic transport coefficients .",
    "a first comparison of these issues has been carried out in ref .",
    "it is the purpose of the present article to separate both ingredients and study the influence of the medium description , the freeze - out prescription and the langevin realization on the heavy - quark spectra . here ,",

    "we elaborate on how the differences in the medium expansion affect heavy - quark spectra by performing a comparison with different transport coefficients and medium prescriptions . specifically , we compare two basic features of heavy - quark spectra at rhic , i.e. , the nuclear suppression factor , @xmath61 , and the elliptic flow , @xmath62 , by studying four setups :    1 .   kh medium / subatech coefficients 2 .",

    "the scenarios i and iv describe the published data on the nuclear suppression factor , @xmath63 , of semileptonic electrons fairly well , despite of different assumptions on the medium and the transport coefficients . to disentangle the effects of the two components , we swap the medium description with the description of the heavy - quark interaction ( scenarios ii and iii ) . in this way we can cross -",
    "compare the results and better identify changes due to the medium or the diffusion mechanism .",
    "since the precise realization of the langevin process has rather little impact in the heavy - quark sector , we have chosen to proceed with the pre - point ( post - point ) prescription for the kh ( vhr ) medium ; the motivation for this choice will be justified in sec .  [",
    "sect : v2-light ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_raa ] depicts the nuclear suppression factor of charm quarks at the end of the respective mixed phases as a function of their transverse momentum for the four scenarios mentioned above .",
    "scenarios i and iv give rather similar results , within ca .  20% . when changing the medium description and leaving the diffusion mechanism the same , i.e. , comparing scenarios i with iii , or ii with iv , one observes a difference of 30 - 50% at high @xmath1 in opposite directions , indicating that the vhr medium induces more `` stopping '' than the kh medium .",

    "one observes again that scenarios i and iv compare reasonably well to each other , on the level of ca .",
    "20 - 30% . however , when interchanging the medium description the elliptic flow either increases by more than a factor of 2 ( scenario iii compared to i ) or decreases by roughly a factor of 2 ( scenario ii compared to iv ) at @xmath65-@xmath66",
    ". the differences at intermediate @xmath1 are thus stronger for @xmath16 than for @xmath63 .",
    "as mentioned above , the calculated @xmath63 and @xmath16 values of charm quarks cause ambiguities in quantitatively disentangling the effects of the expansion scenario from that of the microscopic interaction of heavy quarks in the qgp .",
    "it is therefore important to return to light - quark observables to better distinguish between different scenarios .",
    "light - hadron observables depend on the final state of the expansion scenario but are independent of the interaction of heavy quarks with the plasma constituents .",
    "thus they allow to scrutinize the description of the medium evolution if the freeze out description were unique , which is unfortunately not the case .",
    "a key observable is the elliptic flow of pions or charged particles . in the following",

    "it turns out that the kh+cooper - frye and vhr+milekhin - like prescriptions are rather close up to @xmath81 .",
