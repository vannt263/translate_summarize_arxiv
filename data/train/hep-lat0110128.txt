    "reliable lattice calculations of hadronic matrix elements and quark masses require both high precision numerical simulations and non - perturbative determinations of renormalization constants ( @xmath6-factors ) .",
    "the cp - pacs collaboration recently carried out a sophisticated spectrum calculation in @xmath7 full qcd  @xcite using a renormalization group ( rg ) improved gauge action and a tadpole improved clover quark action .",
    "however , non - perturbative @xmath6-factors were not available for this action combination .",
    "hence analyses had to rely on one - loop perturbative values .",
    "as a first step toward a systematic study of non - perturbative renormalization for this action , we apply the schrdinger functional method  @xcite to calculations of @xmath6 factors for vector ( @xmath0 ) and axial - vector ( @xmath1 ) currents in quenched qcd with the same improved action .",
    "we examine in particular whether a large scaling violation of meson decay constants observed for this action  @xcite is improved with non - perturbative @xmath6-factors .",
    "we report preliminary results in these proceedings .",
    "we follow the method developed by the alpha collaboration  @xcite . namely , we use a lattice geometry of @xmath8 with @xmath9 for @xmath0 with a vector operator at @xmath10 , and @xmath11 for @xmath1 with two axial vector operators at @xmath10 and @xmath12 , except at @xmath13 and 2.4 for @xmath1 ( see sec .",

    "physical size is normalized at @xmath16 2.6 on an @xmath17 lattice . for other @xmath18 values",
    ", two lattice sizes are analyzed to match the physical size using the string tension .",
    "our action has @xmath19 errors since we employ a tadpole improved value of @xmath20 .",
    "therefore we extrapolate / interpolate results linearly in @xmath21 .",
    "we have analyzed 3004000 configurations depending on @xmath18 value and lattice size .",
    "it is straight - forward to calculate @xmath6-factors for @xmath22 for @xmath0 and @xmath23 for @xmath1 .",
    "we find reasonable plateaux in the ratio of green functions for the @xmath6-factors in spite of the @xmath19 error of the action , which implies viability of the schrdinger functional method for our action .",
    "however , for lower @xmath18 values on a large lattice , anomalously large values appear in the ensemble of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "we then estimate @xmath6-factors for low @xmath18 values taking a certain value of the cutoff . for @xmath1 at @xmath13 and 2.4 , the lattice geometry is also changed from @xmath11 to @xmath9 because `` exceptional configurations '' appear very frequently for the original geometry to the extent that the cutoff analysis above does not work .",
