    "properties of domain structures in thin ferroelectric films is currently a focus of extensive research .",
    "it is expected , quite naturally , that an understanding and an ability to control these properties will determine the prospects of applications of nanometer - size ferroelectrics .",
    "it depends critically on the external conditions like presence or absence of electrodes . in this paper",
    ", we discuss domain structures in a system , which is , perhaps , the most important for applications : a ferroelectric film with electrodes .",
    "the polar axis of the material is perpendicular to the film plane and the electrodes are ` real ' meaning that the electric field penetrates into them , although only over tiny depths @xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "this is an adequate model for the perovskite ferroelectric films on a substrate with compressive strain , like batio@xmath0/srruo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 ( bto / sro / sto)@xcite where the misfit strain drives the fe  film into a uniaxial state .",
    "we supplement our analytical results with the relevant numerical estimates for batio@xmath0(bto ) , pbtio@xmath0 ( pto ) , and pb(zr@xmath4ti@xmath4)o@xmath0 ( pzt ) using the material constants available in the literature    incomplete screening of the depolarizing field by srruo@xmath0 electrode leads to an absolute instability of a single domain state and formation of a sinusoidal domain structure when thickness of batio@xmath0 film is slightly above the minimal thickness compatible with ferroelectricity in this system @xcite .",
    "it seems that this situation is typical of real electrodes and we shall consider this case only . to find the minimal thickness , one does not need to take into account higher order terms in the landau - ginzburg - devonshire ( lgd ) free energy including the terms describing the electrostriction since the problem of _ stability _ of the paraelectric phase is _ _ linear__@xcite .",
    "but in order to reveal the characteristics of this structure , i.e. to find out if the equilibrium structure is stripe - like or checkerboard and how the domain boundaries are oriented one has to take into account the anizotropy of elastic and electrostrictive properties of the ferroelectric .",
    "this is the main goal of the present paper .",
    "specifically , we consider the case of cubic crystal anisotropy of elastic and electrostrictive properties only .",
    "this is relevant for films of cubic perovskites which become tetragonal because of in - plane misfit strains due to cubic substrates like in the above - mentioned system .",
    "the change of cubic anisotropy to tetragonal affects most strongly the dielectric properties since the crystals are soft \" dielectrically .",
    "they have much smaller effect on the elastic and electrostrictive properties , which can be considered to be the same as in cubic parent crystals .",
    "explicit account for the electrostriction and anisotropic elasticity is relevant also for study of stability of single domain state .",
    "this has been correctly pointed out by pertsev and kohlstedt @xcite although these authors have missed several important points .",
    "importantly , however @xcite , they overlooked that the state whose stability they were studying was actually _",
    "metastable_. therefore , its stability with respect to small fluctuations did not mean that this state can be used in memory applications .",
    "indeed , its lifetime is very short if the film thickness is not sufficiently larger than that calculated by pertsev and kohlstedt as the limit of single domain stability .",
    "we shall also discuss this stability among other questions this makes sense because of several reasons .",
    "_ first _ , pertsev and kohlstedt performed numerical calculations using material constants for batio@xmath0 and pb(zr@xmath4ti@xmath5)o@xmath0 and the electrode parameters of srruo@xmath0 while our results are analytical and apply to any material of the same symmetry . moreover",
    ", our method applies to other symmetries as well . _",
    "second _ , pertsev and kohlstedt studied stability of the single domain state with respect to polarization wave \"- like fluctuations with a single specific direction of the wave vector , while we consider waves with @xmath6-vectors in arbitrary direction .",
    "_ third _ , pertsev and kohlstedt apparently misinterpreted their own results by mixing together the well - known effect of _ homogeneous _ misfit strains and the effect of strains due to _ inhomogeneous _ polarization .",
    "in fact , the misfit strain simply results in renormalization of the materials constants and was effectively taken into account by all the previous authors .",
    "only the account of the inhomogeneous polarization was pioneered in ref.@xcite .",
    "we show that this effect was vastly overestimated by pertsev and kohlstedt .",
    "in fact , the formal difference by more than an order of magnitude between the results with and without account for electrostriction that they claimed stems from improper comparison of the compressed film with the materials constants renormalized by the misfit strain to one without _ any _ such renormalization at all , and _ not _ from the effect of the inhomogeneous strains on stability  of single domain state .",
    "our analytical calculations provide a general view on the role of the inhomogeneous strains in stability of single domain state .",
    "in particular , they reveal a possibility which seems academic at the moment but no reason is seen to exclude it altogether .",
    "we mean a specific state where _ elasticity _ provokes domain formation of _ non - ferroelastic _",
    "ferroelectric @xmath7 domains .",
    "such a state is realized if a certain condition on the electrostrictive and elastic constants is met .",
    "we are not aware of an experimental realization of these conditions but we can not find arguments prohibiting them .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a qualitative conclusion about possibility of both stabilizing and destabilizing role of inhomogeneous elastic strains for single domain state in ferroelectric films on substrates has been made in our previous paper where we considered an academic case of a  single electrostriction constant and assumed isotropic elasticity @xcite .",
    "a surprising result of the present work is that the _ destabilizing _ effect of the inhomogeneous strains may be very large contrary to the stabilizing one .",
    "another unexpected result is the possibility of a checkerboard domain state if some conditions on the material constants are met .",
    "let us mention that without account for the anisotropic polarization - strain coupling one comes to the conclusion about impossibility of such a state .",
    "for the perovskites this conclusion remains valid but not in the general case .",
    "studying the sinusoidal domain structure in bto , pto and pzt films on srtio@xmath8we find that the equilibrium orientation of the `` domain walls '' is parallel @xmath9 to the cubic axes in the film plane for bto and pto and is at @xmath10 to these axes for pzt . in all cases",
    "the free energy of the sinusoidal domain structure depends very weakly on the domain wall orientation .",
    "this is mainly due to both systems being nearly isotropic elastically and , additionally , the relevant electrostriction constant is relatively small .",
    "this observation may be important for understanding domain creation at smallest thicknesses of the ferroelectric films . for bto / sro / sto system ,",
    "our analytical calculations provide confirmation of the qualitative result of pertsev and kohlstedt about stabilizing effect of inhomogeneous elastic strains for single domain state _ in this system _ but with the above mentioned strong disagreement with their statement about importance of this effect .    having mentioned advantages and new possibilities provided by analytical calculations we should mention also their inherent shortcomings .",
    "our analytical method is feasible within a certain approximation only .",
    "this approximation implies that the domain period is less than the film thickness .",
    "this condition is fulfilled for thick enough films but in very thin films the two quantities are in fact comparable . therefore , the accuracy of our calculations should be investigated for these films , so the new numerical studies are desirable .",
    "we do not expect , however , that the difference between the results of approximated and more exact calculations either within a continuous medium theory or within microscopic theories will be very large given close results of continuous and first principles theories even for films that are just several unit cell thick ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we describe the approximations used and define the terms in the lgd free energy that can be neglected within our approximation in sec.[sec : outline ] .",
    "this let us avoid unnecessary lengthy formulas in the rest of the paper .",
    "we spell out the constituent equations in sec.[sec : constit ]  and then solve the general problem for the ` polarization wave ' ( embryonic stripe domains )  in the fe film with full account for elastic coupling .",
    "this is further used in sec.[sec : orient ] to determine that the domain walls align with crystallographic cubic axes .",
    "then , we find the conditions when the monodomain state first loses its stability with regards to the stripe domain structure in sec.[sec : mdloss ] .",
    "one previously unexplored possibility is that the system can lose stability with regards to checkerboard domain structure , but our results in sec.[sec : checker ] show that such a structure is absolutely unstablein perovskites although it is not necessarily so in the general case .",
    "we summarize the present results in the conclusions .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper are made by analyzing the formula for free energy of the total system as a function of the amplitude @xmath11 of the ferroelectric `` polarization wave '' presenting the sinusoidal domain structure and the homogeneous part of the ferroelectric polarization , @xmath12 . for the electrode and the film parameters of a system like bto / sro / sto , the ferroelectric polarization that is perpendicular to the film plane , schematic of which",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : fefilm ] , has the form    and metal electrodes ( with screening length @xmath13 ) on a misfit substrate .",
    "the misfit makes the film a uniaxial ferroelectric with a spontaneous polarization along @xmath14axis.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    @xmath15    where the orientation of @xmath16 in the @xmath17 plane is not fixed , @xmath18 is the period of the sinusoidal domain structure , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the film thickness . to find the desired free energy , @xmath21 , one has to find the elastic strains and the non - ferroelectric polarization @xmath22 as functions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 to present the total free energy as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath12 only .",
    "the total free energy contains contributions of the ferroelectric film , of the substrate and of the electrode . in principle",
    ", it should also contain a contribution of the voltage source but we consider here a _",
    "short - circuited _ system and are not concerned with the latter contribution .    when calculating elastic strains in the ferroelectric which accompany the inhomogeneous polarization forming the sinusoidal domain structure , we follow the same philosophy as in our previous work.@xcite . in principle , when calculating these strains the inhomogeneous strains in the substrate should be taken into account .",
    "however , it is well known that they propagate into the substrate for about the same distances as the scale of inhomogeneity in the film ( @xmath17 ) plane . in our case",
    ", these inhomogeneities are due to the domain structure , i.e. this scale is the period of the domain structure .",
    "then , it is convenient to consider relatively thick films since the period of the domain structure is relatively small , specifically , it is much less than the film thickness @xcite , fig .",
    "fig : feonsub .",
    "the contribution of the substrate is its elastic energy which , as we have mentioned above , is concentrated within a volume which is _ much smaller _ than the film volume , as defined by a small factor @xmath24 .",
    "another convenience of the thick film limit is that it is possible to disregard the boundary conditions for the inhomogeneous parts of elastic strains and stresses at the surfaces of the ferroelectric . indeed , if we obtain a solution , which does not satisfy the boundary conditions , we can find corrections to such a solution in a way that is conventionally used in the elasticity theory .",
    "first , we apply the external forces to the surfaces , which are necessary to meet the boundary conditions with the strains corresponding to our solution making this solution correct .",
    "second , we apply forces opposite to the previous ones and find the strains produced by the new forces .",
    "these strains provide the correction to the original solution we were looking for .",
    "once more , it is sufficient to observe that in our case the external forces have the period of the domain structure to understand that the elastic energy associated with the corrections necessary to satisfy the boundary conditions can be neglected quite similarly to the elastic energy of the substrate .",
    "another convenience of thick film approximation is given by the possibility to neglect those terms in the lgd free energy , which describe the electrostriction but contain components of non - ferroelectric polarization .",
    "according to refs.@xcite , @xmath25where @xmath26 , @xmath27the  electrostriction terms in the lgd free energy with non - ferroelectric components of polarization may contain the ferroelectric component , like @xmath28 or may not contain them , like in the term @xmath29 . in both cases ,",
    "they contribute to @xmath30 and @xmath31 terms in the free energy depending on @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in the first case ,",
    "this contribution is proportional to @xmath32 and in the second to @xmath33 .",
    "since there are also the terms  @xmath34 @xmath31 that do not contain the small factor @xmath35 the contribution of these terms can be neglected .    taking this into account",
    ", we write down the lgd free energy in the form:@xmath36where@xmath37@xmath38@xmath39here , @xmath40 are the standard piezo - electric coefficients that should not be confused with the parameter @xmath41 defining the transversal profile of the polarization wave ( [ 1 ] ) . in eq.([7 ] ) , @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 the gradient in the plane of the film , @xmath45 is the non - ferroelectric ( ` base ' ) part of the polarization perpendicular to the electrodes @xcite ,",
    "@xmath46 following refs @xcite , we have neglected a term with the gradient in @xmath14direction since it is much smaller than the one in plane of the film , @xmath47 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we have not included the energy of the electric field.into the lgd free energy .",
    "the reason is that we shall use it to write down the constituent equations only .",
    "we shall eliminate @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath45 as well the electric field components from the system of constituent electrostatics equations to obtain two coupled equations of state for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we shall obtain @xmath50 from the resulting equations .",
    "this is possible because of the thick films approximation .",
    "the most straightforward method to obtain @xmath51  would be to substitute eq.([1 ] ) into eq.([6 ] ) supplemented by the electric field energy and to integrate over the film volume .",
    "in general , the result would not be the same as the one obtained from the constituent equations because of approximate character of eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "however , for @xmath52  the two results coincide and that makes it possible to use a more convenient method of the constituent equations .",
    "for the polarization components one has:@xmath53@xmath54before writing down the equations for the strain , we shall eliminate the electric field from the above three equations . assuming eq.([1 ] ) for @xmath55 , eq.([3 ] ) for @xmath56 and putting blreview:@xmath57we can replace eqs.([10]),([eq : pperp ] ) with @xmath58 _",

    ". then , one has to take into account that the homogeneous strains in the plane of the substrate are not possible while inhomogeneous ones are .",
    "both homogeneous and inhomogeneous polarization create homogeneous strain but to a different extent see eqs.([32 ] ) and ( [ 35]).while inhomogeneous strains are created , of course , by the inhomogeneous polarization only . the out - of - plane and in - plane strains couple with the ferroelectric polarization @xmath251 by electrostriction terms with different coefficients and the final result of renormalization of the coefficient of @xmath31 term is due to several contributions and it is not clear upfront . it should be obtained by a consistent analysis , as it has been done above .",
