    "the purpose of this paper is to continue our previous study of the link between the equations of inviscid continuum mechanics and the motion of riemannian manifolds ( _ cf . _",
    "more specifically , we have shown in @xcite that a solution of the system of balance laws of mass and momentum in two space dimensions can be mapped into an evolving two - dimensional riemannian manifold in @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that the geometric image of smooth solutions of the continuum equations for non - wild data ( not simple shears ) can be shadowed by a non - smooth geometric motion which we called generalized shears .",
    "in addition , the geometric initial value problem for generalized simple shears has an infinite number of energy preserving non - smooth solutions .",
    "since the earlier paper was focused on two - dimensional continuum mechanics , it is natural to develop a theory to deal with three space dimensional case , and we provide here when the riemannian manifold is now time evolving in @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , our earlier paper only dealt with inviscid materials . in this paper",
    ", we extend our results to viscous fluids , including the incompressible viscous fluids governed by the classical navier - stokes equations . in particular",
    ", we use the geometric theory to predict the critical profile initial data for the onset of turbulence in channel flow .",
    "the main value of such a continuum - geometry link in @xcite was to give a rather straightforward demonstration for the existence of wild solutions for the equations of inviscid continuum mechanics for classical incompressible and compressible fluids and neo - hookian elasticity , and for the non - uniqueness of entropy weak solutions to the initial value problem .",
    "the work was motivated by the important sequence of papers @xcite by delellis , szekelyhidi , and others on the application of gromov s @xmath4-principle and convex integration @xcite to provide both the existence of wild solutions and the non - uniqueness of solutions to the cauchy problem .",
    "since gromov s work is based on the classical nash - kuiper theorem for non - smooth isometric embeddings in riemannian geometry , it was our goal to exposit a direct map from continuum mechanics to the motion of a riemannian manifold , in order to avoid the rather sophisticated analysis needed to apply gromov s theory .",
    "furthermore , in making the direct continuum to geometry link , it becomes apparent that our approach is very much in the spirit of the einstein equations of general relativity , _ i.e. _ , in both our work and general relativity , the matter relation ( fluids , gases , _ etc .",
    "_ ) on one side of the equations drives the geometric motion of an evolving space - time metric .",
    "perhaps in retrospect , it is no surprise that the proof of the continuum to geometry map in two space dimensions is distinctly different than the proof we provide here for three space dimensions .",
    "the reason is more than just technical and lies at the heart of much of the work for the isometric embedding problem in three and higher dimensional riemannian manifolds .",
    "more specifically , for two - dimensional manifolds , it is rather straightforward to analyze the gauss - codazzi equations which provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an isometrically embedded manifold in @xmath2 and that was the view we took in @xcite .",
    "however , for the case of three space dimensions , all the work to date has avoided the application of the next level of necessary and sufficient conditions ( gauss , codazzi , and ricci equations ) and has dealt with the fully nonlinear embedding equations directly ; we follow this direct approach here as well .",
    "we do this by invoking two key results : the solvability of the system for determination of a metric @xmath0 , given the components of the riemann curvature tensor ( _ cf .",
    "_ deturck - yang @xcite ) , and the local solvability of the isometric embedding problem for the embedding of a three - dimensional riemannian manifold into @xmath3 ( _ cf .",
    "_ maeda - nakamura @xcite ; see also goodman - yang @xcite and chen - clelland - slemrod - yang - wang @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is divided into six sections after this introduction .",
    "section 2 provides a review of the elements of riemannian geometry and the isometric embedding problem .",
    "a short presentation of the balance laws of continuum mechanics is given in section 3 . in section 4 , a short proof is presented for deriving the metric map taking continuum mechanical evolution into evolution of a three - dimensional riemannian manifold immersed in the six - dimensional euclidean space . in section 5 ,",
    "we present a short observation that shearing flow may be mapped into a riemannian flat manifold in the six - dimensional euclidean space . in section 6 , the nash - kuiper theorem for non - smooth isometric embeddings is first recalled and is then applied to show that the geometric initial value problem has an infinite set of weak solutions for the same non - smooth initial data . finally , in section 7 , the theory is applied to the classical incompressible navier - stokes equations and gives a prediction of the critical profile initial data for the onset of turbulence in channel flow .",
    "the critical profile predicted by the geometric theory of this paper is in agreement with the experimentally observed profile given in reichardt @xcite .",
    "this section is devoted to some preliminary discussion and review about geometry and isometric embedding .",
    "riemann @xcite in 1854 introduced the notion of an abstract manifold with metric structure , motivated by the problem of defining a surface in euclidean space independently of the underlying euclidean space .",
    "the isometric embedding problem seeks to establish the conditions for the riemannian manifold to be a sub - manifold of a euclidean space with the same metric .",
    "for example , consider the smooth @xmath5-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath6 with metric tensor @xmath0 . in terms of local",
    "coordinates @xmath7 , the distance on @xmath6 between neighbouring points is @xmath8 where and throughout the paper , the standard summation convention is adopted .",
    "now let @xmath9 be the @xmath10-dimensional euclidean space , and let @xmath11 be a smooth map so that the distance between neighbouring points is given by @xmath12 where the subscript comma denotes partial differentiation with respect to the local coordinates @xmath13 .",
    "the existence of a _ global embedding _ of @xmath6 in @xmath9 is equivalent to the existence of a smooth map @xmath14 for each @xmath15 into @xmath9 .",
    "_ isometric embedding _ requires the existence of a map @xmath14 for which the distances are equal .",
    "that is , @xmath16 which may be compactly rewritten as @xmath17 where @xmath18 , and the inner product in @xmath9 is denoted by symbol `` @xmath19 '' .",
    "the classical isometric embedding of a @xmath20-dimensional riemannian manifold into a @xmath21-dimensional euclidean space is comparatively well studied and comprehensively discussed in han - hong @xcite . by contrast , the embedding of @xmath5-dimensional riemannian manifolds into @xmath22 euclidean space has only a comparatively small literature .",
    "when @xmath23 , the main results are due to bryant - griffiths - yang @xcite , nakamura - maeda @xcite , goodman - yang @xcite , and most recently to poole @xcite and chen - clelland - slemrod - wang - yang @xcite .",

    "in essence , there are two examples : one for the incompressible euler equations , and the other for neo - hookean elasticity which have been provided in @xcite .",

    "for the incompressible euler equations with @xmath121 ( by scaling for any lower bound ) , the singularity of @xmath80 means the pressure @xmath122 , and hence we consider the steady flow : @xmath123 the desired embedding is given by @xmath124 @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a positive constant .",

    "we note the following observation : if we had allowed the steady shearing motion to be the more general case : @xmath139 we still have an exact solution to the incompressible euler equations .",
    "however , perhaps surprisingly , we have not been able to find a three - dimensional manifold that can be identified with this motion .",
    "we wish to compare the metrics arising from the two cases : @xmath140 and @xmath122 , for the incompressible euler equations .",

    ", we can expand the metric locally via the taylor series : @xmath141 for @xmath142 ( in the definition of @xmath143 ) sufficiently large , we see that @xmath144 in the sense of quadratic forms , or in the language of the nash - kuiper theorem that the embedding @xmath145 is _ short _ compared to the embedding @xmath146 .",
    "we now recall the well known nash - kuiper - gromov results .",
    "[ nash - kuiper ] let @xmath147 be a smooth , compact riemannian manifold  @xmath148 .",

    "then the following hold :    if @xmath150 , any short embedding  @xmath151 into @xmath9 can be approximated by isometric embeddings into @xmath9 of class @xmath74 ( nash @xcite and gromov @xcite ) ;    if  @xmath152 , then any short embedding  @xmath151 into @xmath9 can be approximated in @xmath153 by embeddings into @xmath9  of class @xmath1 ( nash @xcite and kuiper @xcite ) .    in our examples",
    ", we are in the case @xmath23 and @xmath154 , so only case ( ii ) applies .",
    "in fact , the issue is quite subtle .",
    "it is quite evident that the shearing motion had its geometric image in @xmath155 and , if the general euler flow had its geometric image in @xmath155 as well , then we could apply ( ii ) with @xmath156 .",
    "this would not only allow a sharper result but more importantly allow us to apply the the theory for @xmath156 by borisov@xcite , at least in the case when the euler flow is locally analytic , which states that embeddings @xmath151 of ( ii ) can not be @xmath157 .",
    "thus there would be an upper bound on their regularity . while it seems likely based on the discussion of @xcite that some upper bound regularity exists for our case , we know of no such result .    as a direct consequence of theorem [ geomotion ] and theorem [ nash - kuiper ] , we can state the following result .

    "as noted above , if there was only one solution to the steady couette problem , the result of such non - uniqueness would seem unlikely , but the key here is that there are many such solutions at large reynolds number and the non - uniqueness of the evolutionary geometric problem is not unexpected .    of course , these results give at the geometric level an indication for both the   onset of turbulence for high reynolds number navier - stokes flow and non - uniqueness of   weak solutions for the cauchy problem for the three - dimensional navier - stokes equations .",
    "specifically , we note that , to apply the above theory , we have needed the three eigenvalues at the ends of the channel fixed and positive , and the transition from the wild `` turbulent '' initial data will occur as @xmath220 passes from positive to negative values for decreasing reynolds number @xmath221 . thus , according to our geometric theory , the critical reynolds number will be given by the formula : @xmath222 in addition , this formula provides an equation for the critical profile for transition from turbulence .",
    "one possible check of this critical profile relation is to use the experimental data of reichardt @xcite where the data are normalized so that @xmath223 .    figure ( a ) ( from @xcite ) gives profiles for water with reynolds number @xmath224 and oil with reynolds number @xmath225 .",
    "we consider the one for oil since the reynolds number for that experiment is closer to the usually accepted reynolds number @xmath226 for transition to turbulence . since we expect that @xmath227 , we drop that term in our critical profile equation and simplify it as @xmath228 let us work on the interval @xmath229 .",
    "we can find the solution for @xmath230 via the relation , @xmath231 .",
    "hence , for @xmath229 , we solve the initial value problem : @xmath232 for @xmath233 to give @xmath234 if we fit this relation to reichardt s figure ( a ) by using @xmath235 , we find @xmath236 , @xmath237 , and so the critical profile is approximately given by @xmath238 .",
    "we note the value of our approximate critical profile at @xmath239 is @xmath240 . while this value is not identically zero , its value is sufficiently small to provide a very good approximation to the reichardt s graph which has the value zero at @xmath239 .",
    "we plot our approximate critical profile in figure ( b ) with the @xmath241axis corresponding to @xmath242 and the @xmath14axis corresponding to @xmath243 .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    while the above computation does not validate the geometric theory , it does at least show the geometric theory is consistent with experiment .",
