    "the motivation for high time resolution photometry is that it provides insight into the astrophysics of the most compact objects in the universe . for example",
    "neutron stars and stellar mass black holes with radii @xmath010  can show variability on timescales down to tens of microseconds , if the emission comes from the surface ( in the case of a neutron star ) or from the inner parts of an accretion disk around these objects .",
    "the most prominent example is the crab pulsar .",
    "it has a period of @xmath033  and during its main pulse it is variable in the optical on timescales down to at least 100  @xcite . besides pulsars ,",
    "x - ray binaries containing a compact object which is accreting matter from a normal star typically show variability on millisecond timescales since 90% of the gravitational energy is released in the inner @xmath0100 , mostly in thermal x - rays @xcite . but",
    "evidence for fast optical variability from x - ray binaries has been reported as well ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "compared to x - ray observations , optical variability studies have the advantage that photon collection areas @xmath0100 times larger can be used and that photon energies are @xmath01000 times smaller .",
    "this means that it could be possible to observe variations on timescales where x - ray observations are photon limited .",
    "high time resolution optical observations are usually done with large optical telescopes @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to use cherenkov telescopes , which have very large reflectors but rather poor angular resolution .",
    "cherenkov telescopes are used to detect very high energy ( @xmath0100100 ) gamma - rays by imaging cherenkov light from air showers produced by these gamma - rays in the upper atmosphere .",
    "the regular gamma - ray observations with cherenkov telescopes can not take place during moonshine , since scattered moonlight increases the night sky background ( nsb ) to a level where the faint flashes of cherenkov light can no longer be detected ( note though that magic does perform limited gamma - ray observations during moderate moonshine @xcite ) .",
    "this presents the possibility for optical observations with these telescopes , e.g. regular monitoring programs of variable sources like x - ray binaries .",
    "we have built an optical photometer ( similar to the one described in @xcite ) and installed it on the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescope ct4 in january and may 2007 ( see figures [ fig : telescopesideview ] and [ fig:7pixcammounted ] ) .            the advantage of using a h.e.s.s .",
    "telescope is its large segmented mirror ( 107  area , @xmath012  diameter , @xmath075% reflectivity ) and in comparison to other cherenkov telescopes its good angular resolution ( fwhm@xmath1 ) .",
    "an overview of the relevant parameters for optical observations with the four major imaging atmospheric cherenkov experiments currently in operation is given in table [ tab : iacts ] .",
    "the reason why cherenkov telescopes have poor angular resolution in comparison to optical telescopes ( typically fwhm@xmath22  limited by seeing ) is that they are designed to image air showers with diameters @xmath01  and the performance of determining air shower parameters ( like length , width and intensity ) does not increase significantly with pixel sizes below @xmath3 ( for a detailed discussion on the h.e.s.s .",
    "optical system see @xcite ) .    .imaging air cherenkov telescope system parameters relevant for optical observations .",
    "shown is the location , the start of operation of all telescopes , the number of telescopes in the array , the mirror area per telescope and the fwhm of the psf ( of the optical system , not to be confused with the spatial resolution for gamma - ray observations ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,>,^,^,>,>,^ \" , ]     for the focal length of @xmath4 of the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescopes the psf fwhm corresponds to @xmath5 in the focal plane . by applying online pointing corrections ( usually done offline for gamma - ray observations ) for atmospheric refraction , telescope deformations and the offset of the photometer relative to the center of the cherenkov camera , a pointing accuracy of less than @xmath6 or @xmath7 was achieved .",
    "this allowed us to install an aperture of diameter @xmath8 corresponding to @xmath9 in front of the central pixel , containing @xmath10 of the signal while reducing the night sky background .",
    "we have built a high time resolution photometer consisting of seven photomultipliers ( pms ) , one to record the light curve from the target and six concentric photomultipliers to reject disturbing signals like meteorites , air showers from cosmic rays , or distant lightning ( see figure [ fig : daq ] ( left ) ) .",
    "the h.e.s.s .",
    "cherenkov camera is focused on a height of @xmath11 , since this is the typical height of the air showers it observes .",
    "it is constructed such that the focus for stars is on its lid and stellar images , as seen by a ccd camera located in the reflector , can be used to align the h.e.s.s .",
    "mirrors . therefore , to install a second detector",
    ", one has to use a plane secondary mirror to put it in the focus ( see figure [ fig:7pixcammounted ] ) .",
    "for our setup this meant that the 7-pixel camera had to be unmounted / mounted every night before / after the cherenkov camera lid was opened / closed for gamma - ray observations .",
    "this could be done in only a few minutes , the mechanical precision of remounting the camera was negligible ( @xmath12 ) . this was checked every night by measuring the position of two leds on the 7-pixel camera relative to the position of 8 leds on the cherenkov camera . to check the pointing accuracy we regularly closed the pneumatic lid of the 7-pixel camera and measured the position of bright stars on this lid in comparison to the 7-pixel camera leds .",
    "the data acquisition ( daq ) system used to record the seven lightcurves is shown in figure  [ fig : daq ] ( right ) .",
    "we used photonis xp2960 photomultipliers ( pms ) as light detectors , with hexagonal winston cones @xcite as light funnels in front of them to achieve @xmath13 coverage around the central pixel .",
    "the pms were operated at high voltages of 8001300 , depending on the nsb due to moonshine , corresponding to gains @xmath14@xmath15 .",
    "the high voltage was chosen such that the mean anode current from background light was always @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "these pms are most sensitive in the wavelength range @xmath18@xmath19 , with a peak quantum efficiency of @xmath20 at @xmath21 .",
    "we used @xmath050  cables to lead the pm signals to the electronics hut , where they were amplified by custom - built , three - stage low - noise amplifiers with a 50  input resistor , gain @xmath22 and shaped with a simple @xmath23 low - pass filter . to digitize the signal we used a sis 3301 flash adc which has eight channels , 14bit resolution , 5  dynamic range and a sampling speed of 100 .",
    "the adc could in principle record the lightcurves at 10  time resolution , but this would generate a data rate of 1.6 gb  ( 2bytesample and 8 channels7 pixels plus an interference monitoring channel connected to a resistor in the 7-pixel camera ) , which can not be written to disk . since we wanted to record the lightcurve continuously , we programmed the adc to average over 128 consecutive samples , giving an effective sampling speed of 1.28  and a data rate of 12mb@xmath24gbh .    in order to get the absolute timing information for every sample , we used a meinberg lantime m300 gps clock to generate a 7  ttl signal , where every 7th ttl pulse occured at a full second .",
    "the adc was used in autobankswitch mode , meaning that the recording of the signal was switched between its two internal memory banks every time it was given a ttl signal from the gps clock .",
    "the reason why we used 7  instead of 1  as the bank switch rate is that one memory bank can store 131072 samples and @xmath25 samples easily fit in one bank . while the adc was recording the signal in one memory bank , the other",
    "was simultaneously read out by a vme cpu and written to disk together with a stop timestamp from the internal clock of the vme cpu .",
    "since the precision of this clock was better than 1  ( it was synchronized to the gps clock , which also acted as a lan time server ) , the absolute time of every sample to the precision of the gps clock ( @xmath26 ) is known . putting 7 memory banks together",
    "always gives 781236 samples , which shows the excellent stability of the sampling rate of the adc .",
    "the 7-pixel camera was built in november / december 2006 and installed , together with the electronics , on ct4 from jan 2027 2007 .",
    "due to bad weather conditions , only a few hours of observations were possible .",
    "the crab pulsar was observed to verify the setup and timing system .",
    "observations were continued from may 2 - 29 and @xmath040 hours of observations were performed , mainly on optically bright low and high mass x - ray binaries .",
    "runs are typically only @xmath030 minutes long because they were interrupted by pedestal and pointing runs to check the proper working of the system . for future observations , several hours of uninterrupted monitoring",
    "are possible .",
    "before searching the data for flares , a quality selection based on the visual inspection of the lightcurves of each run , binned to 1 second resolution , was done ( see figure [ fig : runoverview ] ) . for @xmath080% of the may observations ,",
    "the conditions were good .",
    "the data analysis consists of two steps , first the detection of flares in the central pixel and second the veto of coincident flares in the outer pixels . since the waveform and timescales of variability from the targets are unknown , the flare finding algorithm has to be very general .",
    "we chose the peak correlator ( pc ) algorithm , as described in @xcite in the context of the detection of gravitational wave bursts by interferometric detectors .",
    "the basic idea is to correlate the signal with a gaussian @xmath27 as a generic peak function and to apply a threshold on the correlation .",
    "we use the implementation by @xcite , which is very fast since it calculates the correlations in frequency space , and also takes detector noise ( like 50  interference from power supplies ) into account by estimating and correcting for the power spectral density .    to detect peaks at different time scales , we use",
    "@xmath030 different @xmath28 , optimally distributed across the range 1100 .",
    "the output of the pc algorithm is a list of so called micro events .",
    "micro events are the largest consecutive intervals where the correlation is above the threshold ( typically @xmath07 standard deviations ) and among other parameters have a start and end time @xmath29 and an amplitude @xmath30 at time @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "since often several templates with closeby @xmath28 trigger on a flare , this micro event list is clusterized into a macro event list by merging two micro events if they almost overlap , i.e. if @xmath32 $ ] overlaps for a certain tolerance @xmath33 , usually chosen to be @xmath34 .    at timescales of 110",
    ", there is quite a large amount of flares in the central pixel caused by meteorites , which are also detected in two or three of the outer pixels with a delay of a few 10  ( see figure [ fig : meteoriteevent ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish these background events from flares actually coming from the astronomical target , since they are time - delayed and do not have the same waveform in the outer pixels ( typically longer there since the outer pixels do nt have an aperture in front of the winston cone ) .",
    "lightning and other terrestial signals are typically simultaneous and have the same waveform , and thus are easy to veto by making a cut on the correlation coefficient of the signal from the central pixel with each of the outer pixels in the time interval @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "because of the meteorites we decided to apply the flare - finding algorithm to all seven pixels and then make a coincidence veto on the macro event lists , where only flares from the central pixel are considered that are at least @xmath0150  away from a flare in any of the outer pixels ( there seems to be a cutoff in the distribution of meteorite delays at 130 ) .",
    "the analysis of the january and may 2007 data as well as simulations to determine the detection efficiency and false alarm rate are still in progress .    3400samples or @xmath08.7 . ]",
    "h.e.s.s . is currently building a fifth cherenkov telescope in the center of the array ( planned to be operational in late 2008 ) , which will have a segmented reflector with a mirror area of @xmath35this will be the largest optical reflector in the world  and a psf fwhm of @xmath36 @xcite . using",
    "the same photometer with that much larger telescope would increase the sensitivity by @xmath37 , and another improvement could be made by using high quantum efficiency pms that better match the optical wavelength region 300600 .",
    "it would be desirable to perform simultaneous observations with a second fast photometer , installed either on a normal optical telescope or at another cherenkov telescope like magic , which would practically eliminate all atmospheric background events .",
    "we would like to thank stefan schmidt and christian neureuther for the manufacture of the 7-pixel camera , thomas kihm for help with the daq design and software , christopher van eldik and oliver bolz for help with the implementation of the online pointing corrections , andreas frster , toni hanke and eben tjingaete with the installation of the instrument and observations in namibia , and andr - claude clapson for suggesting the pc algorithm and help with the data analysis ."
