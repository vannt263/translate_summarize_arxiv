    "the main reason these localizations have not been considered very much is that they are not known to exist in general , even in the stable case ( see chapter @xmath3 in @xcite ) .    as every homological localization can be realized as an @xmath0-localization , every cohomological localization , provided it exists , is a localization at a suitable space .",
