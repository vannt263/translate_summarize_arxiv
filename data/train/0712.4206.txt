    "a host of dark matter candidates have been proposed over the years , some more natural than others .",
    "while the axion is an old contender , the most acclaimed candidate is the neutralino which , together with the so - called kk - photon and the heavy photon in little higgs models , belongs to the category of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) .",
    "( see the review by scopel at this conference @xcite ) .",
    "other models of dark matter are often looked at with some disdain for , it is argued , they lack motivation .",
    "well , supersymmetry is certainly well motivated , but the fact is that , due to constraints from colliders , considerable fine tuning is required to obtain the right abundance of neutralinos .",
    "it is in our opinion fair to consider simpler , albeit phenomenologically interesting , toy models with dark matter .",
    "the inert doublet model is such a model @xcite .",
    "it is a simple extension of the standard model , with a brout - englert - higgs sector that could impact electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , it is compatible with colliders constraints @xcite and has a dark matter candidate that could be observable in the near future @xcite .",
    "furthermore , with minor generalization @xcite , it could establish a link between neutrino physics and dark matter .",
    "the model we consider is a two higgs doublet extension of the sm , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , together with a @xmath0 symmetry such that all fields of the standard model and @xmath3 are even under @xmath0 while @xmath4",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is not spontaneously broken , _",
    "i.e. _ that @xmath5 does not develop a _ vev_. as there is no mixing between the doublets , @xmath6 plays the role of the usual higgs particle . because the extra doublet does not couple to quarks ( and leptons in the simplest case )",
    "there are no fcnc .",
    "the most general renormalisable ( cp conserving ) potential of the model is @xmath7 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with real quartic couplings .",
    "the @xmath8 symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation value of @xmath3 , @xmath9 with @xmath10 gev while , assuming @xmath11 , @xmath12    r0.5        we choose ( this is arbitrary ) @xmath13 to be the dark matter candidate .",
    "two @xmath13 mass ranges are consistent with dark matter observations @xcite , either @xmath14 gev or @xmath15 gev .",
    "the former is the most interesting from the point of view of phenomenology and observations .",
    "the relic abundance of @xmath13 is shown on figure 1 below .",
    "the mass spectrum of the extra scalars depends on the quartic couplings @xmath16 and @xmath17 and on the mass parameter @xmath18 .",
    "two interesting situations may arise .",
    "firstly , if @xmath17 is small , there is an approximate @xmath19 symmetry and @xmath20 while , generically , @xmath21 ( large isospin breaking ) .",
    "less obvious is the custodial symmetry that arises if @xmath22 ( resp .",
    "@xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "both limits are of phenomenological interest .",
    "first , large isospin breaking leads to large contributions to @xmath24 or , equivalently , to the @xmath25 parameter @xcite @xmath26 this feature has been exploited in @xcite to screen the @xmath27 and @xmath28 gauge boson masses from an equally large ( but opposite in sign ) contribution from a heavy higgs ( achieving @xmath29 up to @xmath30 ) .",
    "second , we have exploited the custodial symmetry ( vanishing contribution to @xmath31 ) in @xcite together with the possibility that @xmath32 ( resp .",
    "@xmath33 ) to give large radiative corrections to the effective potential . in particular , the large ( negative ) radiative effect of the top quark can be compensated by a large contribution from the extra scalars . in the extreme , although very suggestive , limit of vanishing @xmath34 parameters ( the coleman - weinberg scenario ) , the electroweak symmetry breaking is literally induced by the extra scalar doublet _",
    "i.e. _ by wimp dark matter , a possibility that has been essentially overlooked in the litterature .",
    "some working cases are listed in table 1 .",
    ".instances of mass spectrum from radiative symmetry breaking .",
    "the quartic couplings are large , but still in the perturbative regime .",
    "all these solutions are compatible with the observed abundance of dark matter .",

    "being a scalar particle , the cross - section for direct detection is 100 % spin - independent ( si ) , a specific feature ( one could say a limitation ) of the model . in figure 2 we show the prospect for direct detection while figure 3 displays the integrated flux from the gc into gamma rays @xcite .",
    "et al _ ( see @xcite and the talk by lars bergstrom at this conference @xcite ) have shown that annihilation into photon pairs , which occurs at one - loop , could give a significant gamma ray line . for @xmath35 gev",
    "say , this is in the window of opportunity of the forthcoming glast detector . as emphasized in @xcite this enhancement ( _ i.e.",
