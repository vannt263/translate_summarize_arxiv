    "many of the fundamental problems in the field of low - dimensional quantum spin systems are those related to the nature of the ground states , the spectrum of excitations , and the stability of quantum phases without long - range order ( sachdev 1999 ) .",
    "the major interest boost which these topics have enjoyed is certainly connected to the discovery of the high - t@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "the high - t@xmath0 materials are doped antiferromagnetic insulators where doping destroys the nel long - range order , present in the parent compounds ( manousakis 1991 ) .",
    "it is believed that the antiferromagnetic correlations are intimately tied to superconductivity - a connection that emphasizes the need for good understanding of the magnetically disordered ground state . in a proposal , advocated by anderson ( 1973 , 1987 )",
    ", the ground state is viewed as a coherent superposition of spins paired into singlet bonds , which can `` resonate '' between different configurations .",
    "this resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state is an example of a true spin - liquid - a state that is both translationally and spin - rotationally invariant .",
    "depending on the nature of the correlations between the valence bonds , different varieties of rvb s have been considered ( fradkin 1991 ) .",
    "the spectrum of these systems is however far from being well understood .",
    "a major recent development in the field of high - t@xmath0 materials was the discovery of stripes - a spatial modulation of the spin and charge densities , which seems to be related to superconductivity ( tranquada _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , 1997 ) . in this connection",
    "the study of dimerized , valence bond solid - like ( vbs ) ground states with spontaneously broken translational invariance , has become an important issue .",
    "the stability of such dimerized phases was recently investigated in the framework of the @xmath1 model ( sachdev and vojta 1999a , b , sushkov 1999 , vojta and sachdev 1999 ) . within the approximation schemes used by these authors",
    ", spontaneously dimerized ground states were found to be stable in the region of doping , relevant to the high - t@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "more detailed predictions , relevant to experiments , are currently being developed ( sachdev and vojta 1999b ) .",
    "spontaneous dimer order can also occur due to spin frustrating interactions - this constitutes the subject of the present work .",
    "the basic model which shows such behavior is the two - dimensional @xmath2 heisenberg model on a square lattice .",
    "there are at least two major reasons why this model holds a special place in the physics of spin systems : ( 1 . ) by itself it is one of the simplest models which exhibits quantum transitions between long - range ordered phases and a quantum disordered phase - a topic of fundamental interest ( sachdev 1999 ) , ( 2 . ) even though the @xmath2 model does not contain charge dynamics , the understanding of how translational symmetry is broken in a purely insulating spin background is crucial to the finite doping situation as well . indeed , the techniques used in the analysis of the @xmath1 model by vojta and sachdev ( 1999 ) and sushkov ( 1999 ) have been tested first on purely spin models and rely heavily on the good handling of the zero doping case . finally , due to its simpler nature , the @xmath2 model allows for a comprehensive and accurate description of the ground state properties and the spectrum of excitations , which so far is lacking for the @xmath1 model .",
    "the @xmath2 model has been discussed in numerous works over the last ten years and some of the important issues that have been addressed are : ( 1 . ) how is the nel order , present for small frustration ( @xmath3 ) , destroyed as frustration increases , and ( 2 . )",
    "is a quantum disordered phase present in a finite window of frustration , and what is the structure of this phase .",
    "let us mention several representative papers which discuss these points , without attempting to give a comprehensive literature review .",
    "spin - wave calculations , both at the non - interacting level as well as including interactions perturbatively in powers of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the spin value ) , have found that the magnetization decreases with increasing frustration , ultimately vanishing at a critical value ( igarashi , 1993 ) .",
    "these calculations however can not predict the structure of the phase beyond the instability point , or the location of the phase boundary with high accuracy , since as the magnetization decreases more and more powers of @xmath4 have to be included ( strong spin - wave interactions ) .",
    "exact diagonalization ( ed ) of clusters as large as @xmath6 ( schulz _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , 1996 ) have found a finite region of quantum disordered ( gapped ) phase , but have failed to determine with certainty what the dominant correlations or type of order ( e.g. dimer , plaquette , etc . )",
    "are dominant in this phase .",
    "the ed calculations also suffer from large finite - size corrections , especially for strong frustration .",
    "an insight into the structure of the disordered phase was possible with the help of the large @xmath7 expansion technique ( read and sachdev 1990 , 1991 , sachdev and read 1991 ) .",
    "these authors predicted the quantum disordered phase to be spontaneously dimerized in a particular ( columnar ) configuration ( see figure 1(a ) ) .",
    "high order dimer series expansions around this configuration were performed ( gelfand _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 , gelfand 1990 , kotov _ et al . _",
    "1999a ) , all confirming its stability in a window of frustration .",
    "thus the spontaneously dimerized state has emerged as the most probable candidate for a disordered ground state .",
    "let us mention in this connection that in one - dimensional systems the lieb - schultz - mattis ( lsm ) theorem guarantees that a gapped phase in a quantum spin system breaks translational symmetry ( lieb _ et al .",
    "extension of the lsm theorem to two - dimensions was proposed ( affleck 1988 ) but not proven in the most general case .",
    "the large @xmath7 and dimer series results however seem to confirm the validity of the lsm theorem in 2d as well , including , in fact , the case of finite doping ( sachdev and vojta 1999b ) .",
    "the present work is devoted to discussion of several aspects of the spontaneously dimerized phase , with particular emphasis on the excitation spectrum , including collective modes ( section ii ) , and the evolution of the spin - spin correlations and the dimer order parameter throughout the disordered phase ( section iii ) .",
    "properties near the nel ordered - quantum disordered phase are also discussed . a preliminary account of some of the results has been given by kotov _",
    "( 1999a ) and kotov and sushkov ( 1999 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 model is defined via the hamiltonian :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) , and @xmath10 - the frustrating diagonal next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) coupling on a square lattice ( see figure 1(a ) ) .",
    "the possible ordered phases for small ( large ) @xmath3 are shown in figure 1(b)(figure 1(c ) ) , and are referred to as the nel and collinear phase , respectively .",
    "the phase diagram of the model , as determined by dimer series expansions in the disordered phase ( this work , see below ) , and ising series expansions in the two ordered phases ( oitmaa and zheng 1996 ) , is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the disordered phase is stable in the interval @xmath11 , although there is uncertainly in the exact location of the boundaries due to the poorer convergence near them .",
    "we proceed with a description of the spectrum of excitations and its evolution in the quantum disordered phase .      in order to calculate the spectrum we use the `` strong - coupling '' philosophy ,",
    "i.e. develop perturbative expansions around a `` perfect '' dimer configuration ( represented as a direct product of singlets ) .",
    "the columnar dimerization pattern used in the expansions is shown in figure 1(a ) .",
    "unlike systems where the dimerization is explicit , i.e. caused by alternation in the heisenberg exchange , in the @xmath2 model there is no formally small expansion parameter ( both inter- and intra - dimer couplings are of the same order in the relevant parameter regime ) . to achieve maximum reliability of our results",
    "we have developed and compared two techniques which take into account the inter - dimer interactions .",
    "the first one is the dimer series expansion , where a series for the appropriate observable is generated in powers of the inter - dimer interaction to high order ( typically around 10 ) .",
    "the generation and resummation of such a series as well as other types of linked - cluster expansions involve a lot of technical details ( gelfand _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) . in what follows we will present the results only .",
    "our second approach is based on diagrammatic resummation of selected ( infinite ) series which we find to give the dominant contribution .",
    "the two approaches are quite similar in spirit , but technically very different , thus allowing us to make sure that the ( strong ) interaction effects are treated properly .    in order to get a feeling for the types of interactions between the dimers , it is useful to write the hamiltonian , eq.(1 ) in terms of operators creating triplets ( @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the dimer site index , and @xmath14 ) from the `` perfect '' dimer configuration .",
    "such a representation was discussed by sachdev and bhatt ( 1990 ) , and leads to the effective hamiltonian : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 where : @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 an important point to be made is that the hamiltonian , eq.(2 ) in terms of the triplets is exact , i.e. the cubic @xmath22 and the quartic @xmath23 vertices are the only ones generated .",
    "however in addition one has to make sure that no double occupancy on a single site is allowed , i.e. @xmath24 , which follows from the fact that a triplet is composed of two spins @xmath25 and consequently it is impossible to create higher on - site spins .",
    "when the dimer series is developed , this constraint is taken into account explicitly in every order of the perturbative expansion .",
    "on the other hand if we choose to treat the interactions @xmath26 and @xmath27 diagrammatically , which is conveniently done in momentum space , it is useful to introduce an ( infinite ) on - site repulsion @xmath28 as an additional vertex in the theory ( kotov _ et al",
    ". _ 1998 ) :    @xmath29    since the interaction is infinite , it has to be treated to infinite order of perturbation theory , i.e. replaced by an effective scattering vertex @xmath30 .",
    "the latter turns out to have the structure @xmath31 and has the explicit form ( kotov _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) :    @xmath32^{-1}= - \\sum_{\\bf{q } } \\frac{u_{\\bf{q}}^{2 } u_{\\bf{k}- \\bf{q}}^{2}}{\\omega - \\omega_{\\bf{q } } - \\omega_{\\bf{k}- \\bf{q } } }   + \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{c } u \\rightarrow v \\\\",
    "\\omega \\rightarrow -\\omega \\end{array } \\right\\}.\\ ] ]    here @xmath33 are bogoliubov coefficients , arising from the diagonalization of the quadratic part @xmath34 , eq.(3 ) , which are given by the standard expression @xmath35 .",
    "we denote by @xmath36 the one - particle dispersion , which on a quadratic level is : @xmath37 , and then gets renormalized by the interaction terms .",
    "needless to say , the vertex @xmath38 does not replace exactly @xmath39 , but can be viewed as the best approximation for low density of triplets .",
    "it is intuitively clear that if the density increases the hard - core constraint becomes harder to satisfy , leading , on a technical level , to generation of additional vertices .",
    "we have found however that the triplet density @xmath40 stays around 0.3 throughout the disordered phase , thus justifying our approximation eq.(10 ) .",
    "next , the corresponding dyson equation with one - loop self - energies arising from the three vertices eqs.(4,5,10 ) is solved self - consistently for the triplet spectrum @xmath41 . explicit formulas and the corresponding diagrams for hamiltonians with similar structure to eq.(2 ) can be found , e.g. in the works by two of us and co - authors ( kotov _ et al .",
    "_ 1999b , shevchenko _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) . here",
    "we only present the results .",
    "let us note that , as pointed out by chubukov and jolicoeur ( 1991 ) , the interaction effects are responsible for creating a finite window of frustration where the gap is non - zero , i.e. the dimer phase is stable only . ] .    in figure 3 the spectrum calculated by the dimer series expansion ( order 8) is plotted . as frustration increases , the minimum of the dispersion shifts from the nel ordering wave vector @xmath42 to the collinear ordering @xmath43 .",
    "we work in the brillouin zone of the dimerized lattice ( doubled unit cell in the x - direction ) , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the convergence of the dimer series is quite poor in certain regions of @xmath46 space which we attribute to decay , caused by an overlap with the two - particle continuum ( seen clearly in figure 4 ) .",
    "the evolution of the gaps at the two ordering wave - vectors is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the points where the gap vanishes are the two quantum critical points where transitions take place into the corresponding ordered phases .",
    "we estimate the locations of these points , within errorbar , to be @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    in figure 4",
    "we present a comparison between our diagrammatic and dimer series results for the triplet spectrum for a fixed value of frustration @xmath49 .",
    "we find that the agreement is excellent .",
    "this figure also shows that the error bars on the dimer series curve are the largest ( i.e. the series does not converge well ) in the @xmath46 interval where the dispersion enters the scattering continuum , as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "one can also compare the gaps at @xmath42 calculated by the two methods ( kotov _ et al . _",
    "both approaches produce an almost linear variation of @xmath50 in the disordered phase , and give very similar values for @xmath51 , although generally the diagrammatic method gives larger gap values compared to the dimer series .",
    "we believe that the combination of the two methods leads to a very accurate description of the spectrum in the quantum disordered phase .",
    "we now turn to the description of the spectrum of collective two - particle excitations with spin @xmath52 .",
    "our motivation for the study of this branch of the spectrum is two - fold : ( 1 . )",
    "quasi one - dimensional systems , such as spin chains and ladders ( sushkov and kotov 1998 , shevchenko _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) were found to have well defined singlet bound states .",
    "frustration was also generally found to increase the binding energy of these modes .",
    "collective states in frustrated 2d systems however have not been studied .",
    "a gapped spinless collective mode , generated non - perturbatively via instanton effects , appears in the large - n field theory solution ( read and sachdev 1990 ) .",
    "moreover , the energy scale ( gap ) of this mode determines the variation of the dimer order parameter near the nel critical point @xmath51 .",
    "it is important to explore this non - trivial connection from the dimer expansion point of view , which takes into account fluctuation effects differently from the large - n approach , and is expected to perform much better numerically .",
    "the wave function of two triplets combined into a state with @xmath52 is given by ( * q * is the total momentum of the pair ) : @xmath53 the attraction between the triplets is mainly due to the two - particle scattering vertex @xmath54 , relative to which the ( second - order ) contribution of @xmath55 turns out to be quite small and will be neglected from now on for simplicity .",
    "diagrammatically the mutual scattering of two quasiparticles is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the equation determining the bound state energy @xmath56 reads : @xmath57\\psi({\\bf q } , { \\bf q})= \\sum_{\\bf p}m^{s}({\\bf p } , { \\bf q } , { \\bf q})\\psi({\\bf p } , { \\bf q}),\\ ] ] where @xmath58 + u \\right \\}.\\ ] ] the hard - core repulsion ( @xmath59 ) has to be also taken into account by imposing the following condition via a lagrange multiplier : @xmath60    in figure 4 we present our results for the bound state spectrum @xmath61 at @xmath49 , relatively to the two - particle scattering continuum .",
    "the bound state has a finite binding energy @xmath62 , defined as @xmath63 $ ] , throughout the brillouin zone , with the exception of the point @xmath42 and its vicinity .",
    "the binding for @xmath64 is quite small due to the closeness of the the nel critical point ( see discussion below ) .",
    "the strongest binding takes place for @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "in figure 6 we present the evolution of the bound state singlet gap for @xmath64 , @xmath67 which will be of particular interest to us in the next section . this gap is larger that the one - particle triplet gap @xmath68 , and appears to go to zero ( within our resolution ) , along with @xmath69 , as the nel transition point @xmath47 is approached .",
    "we must note that our treatment breaks down at the very vicinity of @xmath51 since divergences in our diagrams start appearing for @xmath70 .",
    "such divergences can presumably be summed by renormalization group techniques , which we have not attempted in the present work .",
    "therefore the values of the gaps for @xmath71 , shown in figure 6 should be viewed as being practically zero within the error of our calculation at that point .",
    "it is clear that since for @xmath64 the binding energy is given by @xmath72 , it must approach zero at the critical point @xmath51 .",
    "the full evolution of @xmath73 is shown in figure 6 . around the middle of the quantum disordered phase @xmath74",
    "the binding is large ( @xmath75 ) , then it shows am almost linear decrease , and for @xmath76 becomes smaller than the accuracy of our calculation .",
    "alternatively , in the regime @xmath70 one can study the asymptotics of @xmath73 analytically ( kotov and sushkov 1999 ) with the result :    @xmath77    here we have also shown the asymptotic behavior of the radius @xmath78 of the bound state ( defined as the spatial extent of the wave function @xmath79 ) .",
    "all energies are measured in units of @xmath80 and @xmath81 are constants of order unity .",
    "thus we can see that @xmath73 vanishes exponentially fast as a function of the triplet gap , implying an exponentially large radius of the composite state .",
    "this behavior is certainly not captured well numerically in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "the properties of the spectrum near the spontaneously dimerized - nel critical point are quite peculiar .",
    "in addition to the triplet gap @xmath69 , the singlet ( bound state ) gap goes to zero as well .",
    "however the spectral weight of the composite singlet , which is determined by its binding energy ( or size ) , approaches zero exponentially fast near the transition point .",
    "for this reason we do not expect that the singlet mode can affect the critical dynamics of the triplets and change the @xmath82 universality class , associated with such a transition . to compare our results with the large - n approach we notice that the latter also predicts two large length scales near the critical pont , corresponding to the small gaps of a triplet and a spinless collective mode ( read and sachdev 1990 ) .",
    "one of the scales was found to be a ( large ) power of the other one and it was argued ( chubukov _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) that this is characteristic of a `` dangerously irrelevant '' coupling , i.e. a coupling which is irrelevant at the critical fixed point , but relevant in the phase , from which the transition is approached .",
    "thus the overall structure of the spectrum as well as the appearance of the additional singlet mode and its effect on the critical properties seem to be quite similar in ours and the large - n field theory approach .",
    "we must notice however that the construction of the spectrum of excitations ( and consequently all associated details ) are very different in the two approaches and comparison has not been attempted .",
    "in this section we discuss the behavior of the dimer order parameter ( dop ) , mainly focusing on two issues : ( 1 . )",
    "how does the dop reflect the structure of the spectrum found in the previous section ? ( 2 . )",
    "does the dop go to zero at the nel critical point , i.e. is spontaneous dimerization possible in the ordered phase ? even though we can not give completely definite answers to these questions , we believe we can shed some light on the issues .",
    "the large - n approach gives the following prediction for the dop near the critical point ( read and sachdev 1990 ) : @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the parameter of the @xmath85 expansion ( @xmath86 is the physical limit ) , and the constant is of order unity .",
    "therefore a very fast ( even singular ) vanishing of the dop at the critical point is expected in this scenario .",
    "however other works ( gelfand _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 , sachdev and bhatt 1990 ) , which are similar in treatment to ours , have not found any substantial decrease of the dop near the transitions point , thus leaving the issue still open .",
    "let us start by examining the spin - spin correlation functions , defined as : @xmath87 , where the spin indexes refer to the sites , as numbered in figure 1 .",
    "in figure 7 we plot the variation of these quantities obtained by dimer series expansions to order nine . the strength of the inter - dimer correlations in the @xmath88 direction is weaker than in the @xmath89 direction in most of the disordered phase , with the exception of the regions around the two critical points .",
    "therefore the spontaneously dimerized phase can be viewed as a system of weakly coupled two - chain ladders ( the chains running in the @xmath89 direction ) .",
    "this interpretation was pointed out by singh _",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "the dimer order parameters in the two directions are defined as : @xmath90 , and their variation is shown in figure 8 . unlike the previously reported dimer series calculations ( gelfand _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) , our results show a substantial decrease of both order parameters near the nel critical point . in fact @xmath91 appears to be zero in a wide region around this point , up to @xmath92 .",
    "the difference between ours and the previous results is most likely due to the longer series that we have obtained , and consequently a better treatment of the inter - dimer interactions . in figure 8",
    "we present also our diagrammatic result for @xmath93 which clearly shows a very small variation ( @xmath91 has similar behavior ) .",
    "this is quite puzzling , as the dimer series and the diagrammatic approach give very similar results for the triplet spectrum .",
    "we have identified the source of this discrepancy to be in the very small variation of the in - dimer spin - spin correlation @xmath94 in the diagrammatic calculation .",
    "figure 9 shows this quantity , calculated by the two methods .",
    "indeed , a substantial difference is found in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "an important effect , leading to an explanation of this difference was discussed by kotov _",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "let us elaborate more on that point .",
    "one can easily see that the correlator @xmath94 is related to the density of quasiparticles @xmath95 via :    @xmath96    from figure 9 the dimer series estimates @xmath97 at the critical point , to be compared with the smaller diagrammatic value @xmath98 .",
    "the bogoliubov coefficient @xmath99 is determined by the strength of quantum fluctuations @xmath100 ( eq.(3 ) ) , as can be formally seen from its definition ( see text following eq.(10 ) ) .",
    "a sharp increase in @xmath100 can be due to a strong mixing between the ground state ( singlet ) and a nearby low - lying singlet state . as discussed in the previous section",
    "the two - particle singlet bound state has a very low energy near the nel critical point and therefore can influence substantially the quantum fluctuations .",
    "technically this effect is given by the diagram for the anomalous green s function ( which renormalizes @xmath100 ) , shown in the inset of figure 9 . in order to demonstrate the influence of the bound state on @xmath100",
    "let us consider a simplified form of the two - particle interaction @xmath54 and assume that this is the only term contributing to the formation of the bound state ( i.e. neglect the @xmath28 and @xmath78 contributions ) .",
    "choose @xmath101 ( i.e. only the @xmath88 part of the interaction ) , which leads to a separable kernel @xmath102 ( eq.(13 ) ) , and thus allows us to write the solution in closed form .",
    "in this simple case the diagram in figure 9 leads to the following renormalization :    @xmath103    the expression in the numerator is the first order self - energy contribution , which more generally is : @xmath104 , while the denominator is accumulated from the resummation of the series , shown in figure 5 .",
    "eq.(17 ) is to be compared with the equation for the energy of the singlet bound state ( eq.(12 ) ) , which in this case is :    @xmath105    setting @xmath106 in eq.(18 ) one can see that as the energy of the bound state @xmath107 decreases , the correction to @xmath108 increases ( and in fact diverges in the limit @xmath109 ) , leading also to an increase in the density @xmath95 .",
    "although we have not performed a fully self - consistent calculation of the effect discussed above , it is quite clear that the low - energy singlet bound state is mainly responsible for the increase of the quantum fluctuations near the nel critical point . for comparison , in the large - n theory of read and sachdev ( 1990 )",
    "there is a direct relationship between the gap in the singlet spectrum and the dimer order parameter , leading to the fast vanishing of the latter .",
    "even though our dimer series results are consistent ( within errorbar ) with vanishing of the dimer order parameter , we certainly can not determine its critical behavior .",
    "to summarize our main results :    ( 1 . ) we have calculated the one - particle triplet as well as the collective two - particle singlet excitations .",
    "both branches of the spectrum were found to be stable ( i.e. gapped ) in the spontaneously dimerized phase .",
    "the spontaneous dimer order parameters ( @xmath93 and @xmath91 ) vanish at the nel quantum critical point . we have presented arguments that the disappearance of the dimer order is related to presence of the low - energy ( ultimately gapless ) singlet collective mode .    ( 4 . )",
    "the collective singlet mode does not influence the quantum critical dynamics of the triplets , since its spectral weight vanishes exponentially fast at the critical point .",
    "thus the @xmath82 universality class describes the transition .",
    "so far we have not analyzed the region of the phase diagram near the transition to the collinear phase , @xmath48 .",
    "based on the analysis of section iii it would be tempting to take as a starting point of the analysis a system of weakly interacting spin ladders .",
    "this description certainly appears to be well justified in the neighborhood of the point @xmath110 .",
    "the heisenberg model on a frustrated spin ladder has been previously analyzed ( zheng _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , kotov _ et al . _",
    "1999b ) and a fairly good understanding of the various phases was achieved .",
    "however it is not clear how far this analogy can be used , since near @xmath111 the strength of the inter - dimer correlations in the two spatial directions is practically the same , thus making the single ladder problem not representative of the full two - dimensional one .",
    "we also note that the quantum transition near @xmath111 appears to be of first order ( singh _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) .",
    "other possible types of spontaneous order , such as the plaquette one , have also been discussed in the literature .",
    "two works have favored this order as a good candidate for a ground state in the quantum disordered regime ( zhitomirsky and ueda 1996 , capriotti and sorella 1999 ) , whereas a recent work based on plaquette series expansions has found this configuration to be unstable ( singh _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , thus presenting strong evidence that plaquette order does not take place in the @xmath2 model .",
    "( a. ) the isotropic two - dimensional heisenberg model on a triangular lattice is believed to be long - range ordered with a non - collinear spin arrangement , but with a very small magnetization .",
    "a small variation of the couplings however stabilizes a spontaneously dimerized phase in this system ( zheng _ et al .",
    "since the quantum transition between a non - collinear and a quantum disordered phase is expected to be in the @xmath112 universality class ( chubukov 1991 , azaria and delamotte 1994 ) , the properties of singlet modes in such a system are of particular interest .",
    "a singlet mode , in addition to the triplet one , is expected to become gapless and relevant at the transition point .",
    "this scenario is very different from the one discussed in the present work .",
    "( b. ) the heisenberg model on a kagom lattice was found to have very peculiar properties , such as a gap to triplet excitations ( i.e. a disordered ground state ) , with many low - energy singlet excitations in the gap ( waldtmann _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , mila 1998 ) .",
    "this structure of the spectrum suggests that a simple spontaneous dimerization pattern ( of the type discussed in this work ) is highly unlikely .",
    "a more probable scenario is a larger `` dominant '' cluster with strong resonance between the dimers .",
    "it remains to be seen whether translational invariance is broken in this system , or it represents an example of a true spin liquid .",

    "<S> spontaneous dimer order is present in the quantum disordered phase of this model . </S>",
    "<S> we study the stability and analyze the structure of the spectrum , including the two - particle singlet excitation branch throughout the disordered phase , as well as in the vicinity of the nel critical point . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of the dimer order parameter is also given , and it is argued that near the critical point it reflects the presence of the low - energy singlet bound state . </S>"
