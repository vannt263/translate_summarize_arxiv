    "the design and management of green wireless networks @xcite has become increasingly important for modern wireless networks , in particular , to manage operating costs .",
    "futuristic ( beyond 5 g ) cellular networks face the dual challenges of being able to respond to the explosion of data rates and also to manage network energy consumption . due to the limited spectrum and large number of active users in modern networks ,",
    "energy - efficient distributed power control is an important issue .",
    "sensor networks , which have multiple sensors sending information to a common receiver with a limited energy , capacity have also recently surged in popularity .",
    "energy minimization in sensor networks has been analysed in many recent works @xcite .",
    "+ several of the above described systems have some common features :    1 .",
    "multiple transmitters connected to a common receiver .",
    "2 .   lack of centralization or coordination , i.e. , a distributed and de - centralized network .",
    "3 .   relevance of minimizing energy consumption or maximizing energy - efficiency ( ee ) .",
    "transmitters that have arbitrary data transmission .",
    "these features are present in many modern systems like a sensor network which has multiple sensors with limited energy connected in a distributed manner to a common receiver .",
    "these sensors do nt always have information to transmit , resulting in sporadic data transmission .",
    "another example would be several mobile devices connected to a hot - spot ( via wifi or even bluetooth ) . due to these features of the network ,",
    "inter - transmitter communication is not possible and the transmitters are independent decision makers .",
    "therefore , implementing frequency or time division multiple access becomes harder and a mac protocol ( with single carrier ) is often the preferred or natural method of channel access .      in many existing works , both network - centric and user - centric approaches have been studied . in a network - centric approach , the global energy - efficiency ( gee )",
    "is defined as the ratio between the system benefit ( sum - throughput or sum - rate ) over the total cost in terms of consumed power @xcite . however ,",
    "when targeting an efficient solution in an user - centric problem , the gee becomes not ideal as it has no significance to any of the decision makers . in this case ,",
    "other metrics are required to reflect the individual interest of each decision maker .",
    "therefore , we redefine the gee to be the sum over individual energy - efficiencies as a suitable metric of interest @xcite .",
    "+ the major novelty of this work is in improving the * sum of energy - efficiencies * for a communication system with * all the listed features above*. in such a * decentralized and distributed network * , as each transmitter operates independently , implementing a frequency division or a time division multiple access is not trivial .",
    "therefore , we are interested in looking at a * mac system * where all transmitters operate on the same band",
    ". additionally , * ee * will be our preferred metric due to its relevance .",
    "this metric has been defined in @xcite as the ratio between the average net data rate and the transmitted power . in @xcite , the total power consumed by the transmitter",
    "was taken into account in the ee expression to design distributed power control which is one of the most well known techniques for improving ee . however , many of the works available on energy - efficient power control consider the ee defined in @xcite where the possible presence of a queue at the transmitter is ignored .",
    "in contrast with the existing works , we consider a new generalized ee based on a cross - layer approach developed recently in @xcite .",
    "this approach is important since it takes into account : 1 ) a fixed cost in terms of power namely , a cost which does not depend on the radiated power ; and 2 ) * the presence of a finite packet buffer and sporadic packet arrival * at the transmitter ( which corresponds to including the 4th feature mentioned above ) .",
    "although providing a more general model , the distributed system in @xcite may operate at a point which is energy - inefficient . indeed , the point at which the system operates is a nash equilibrium ( ne ) of a certain non - cooperative static game .",
    "the present work aims at filling this gap by not only considering a cross - layer approach of energy - efficient power control but also improving the system performance in terms of sum of energy - efficiencies .",
    "nash bargaining ( nb ) solution in a cooperative game can provide a possible efficient solution concept for the problem of interest as it is pareto - efficient .",
    "however , it generally requires global channel state information ( csi ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are interested in improving the average performance of the system by considering long - term utilities .",
    "we focus then on repeated games ( rg ) where repetition allows efficient equilibrium points to be implemented . unlike static games which are played in one shot ,",
    "rg are a special case of dynamic games which consider a cooperation plan and consist in repeating at each step the same static game and the utilities result from averaging the static game utilities over time @xcite .",
    "there are two relevant dynamic rg models : finite ( frg ) and discounted ( drg ) .",
    "the frg is defined when the number of stages during which the players interact is finite . for the drg model ,",
    "the discount factor is seen as the stopping probability at each stage @xcite .",
    "the power control problem using the classic ee developed by goodman et al in @xcite has been solved with rg only in @xcite where authors developed an operating point ( op ) relying on individual csi and showed that rg lead to efficient distributed solution . here",
    ", we investigate the power control problem of a mac system by referring to rg ( finite and discounted ) where the utility function is based on a cross - layer approach .",
    "accordingly , we contribute to :    1 .",
    "determine the closed - form expressions of the minimum number of stages for the frg and the maximum discount factor for the drg .",
    "these two parameters identify the two considered rg .",
    "2 .   determine a distributed solution pareto - dominating the ne and improving the system performances in terms of powers and utilities compared not only to the ne but also to the nb solution even for high number of users .",
    "3 .   show that the rg formulation when using the new ee and the new op leads to significant gains in terms of social welfare ( sum of utilities of all the users ) compared to the ne .",
    "4 .   show that the following aspects of the cross - layer model improve considerably the system performances when comparing to the goodman model even for large number of users : * the minimum number of stages in the cross - layer ee model can always be shorter than the minimum number of stages in the goodman ee formulation . *",
    "the social welfare for the drg in the cross - layer model decreases slightly when the number of users increases while it decreases considerably in the goodman model . 5 .",
    "show that in real systems with random packet arrivals , the cross - layer power control algorithm outperforms the goodman algorithm and then the new op with the cross - layer approach is more efficient .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "problemstatement ] , we define the system model under study , introduce the generalized ee metric and define the non - cooperative static game .",
    "this is followed ( section [ sec : nashbargainingsolution ] ) by the study of the nb solution . in section [ sec : repeatedgamesformulation ] , we introduce the new op , give the formulation of both rg models ( frg and drg ) and determine the closed - form expressions of the minimum number of stages and the maximum discount factor as well .",

    "the purpose of this work is to determine how each user is going to control its power in an optimum way .",
    "game theory , as a powerful mathematical tool , helps to solve such an optimization problem where the utility function is the ee which is a function of the users powers .",
    "since the system under study has multiple agencies each with individual interest , the sum over individual energy - efficiencies will be considered as the performance metric reflecting the individual interest of each decision maker .",

    "we notice that starting from @xmath166 , the maximum discount factor of the cross - layer model converges to @xmath164 corresponding to the goodman model .     as a function of the packet arrival rate @xmath25 ( @xmath167 ) . ]    in a second step , we plotted in fig .",
    "[ reg9 ] the variation of the drg social welfare as a function of @xmath168 .",

    "thus , when @xmath170 , @xmath160 reaches highest value .",
    "however , we stress that @xmath160 decreases with the number of users especially for the goodman model while it is quite similar for the cross - layer model .",
    "this confirms that the proposed new op is still quite efficient and can be utilized for games with high number of users .     as a function of @xmath169 ( @xmath167 ) . ]    finally , we plot for both rg models ( frg and drg ) the social welfare when using the cross - layer approach against the constant power @xmath23 for two different values of the packet arrival rate @xmath25 ( @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) .",
    "the considered system is composed of @xmath173 users and the spreading factor @xmath142 is fixed to @xmath174 .",
    "the idea consists in studying the efficiency of the cross - layer approach regarding the goodman power control algorithm .",
    "accordingly , for each packet arrival rate , we plot the social welfare with the cross - layer approach ( powers at the equilibrium are determined normally according to @xmath25 ) and the social welfare with the cross - layer power control but when powers at the equilibrium are determined by the goodman algorithm @xmath175)$ ] .",
    "indeed , the packet arrival rate is assumed constant in the goodman model and equal to 1 ( packets arrive with probability @xmath176 ) . for both rg models",
    ", we stress that the cross - layer power control approach outperforms the goodman algorithm for both values of the packet arrival rate @xmath25 .",
    "important ( relative ) gains are reached . to illustrate this , for @xmath177 and @xmath178 watt",
    "the relative gain is higher than @xmath179 in the frg and the drg as well .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the op with the cross - layer approach provides better performances and is more efficient than the op with the goodman power control approach .     for @xmath177 and @xmath180 : the cross - layer power control approach outperforms the goodman algorithm . ]     for @xmath177 and @xmath180 : the cross - layer approach improves the power control when compared to the goodman algorithm . ]",
    "in this paper , we have investigated rg for distributed power control in a mac system .",
    "as the ne is not always energy - efficient , the nb solution might be a possible efficient solution since it is pareto - efficient .",
    "however , the latter , in general , requires global csi at each transmitter node .",
    "thus , we were motivated to investigate using the repeated game formulation and develop a new op , that simultaneously is both more efficient than the ne and achievable with only individual csi being required at the transmitter . also , we consider a new ee metric taking into account the presence of a queue at the transmitter with an arbitrary packet arrivals .",
    "cooperation plans are proposed where the new op is considered and closed - form expressions of the minimum number of stages for the frg and the maximum discount factor for the drg have been established .",
    "the study of the social welfare ( sum of utilities of all the users ) shows that considerable gains are reached compared to the ne ( for the frg and drg ) .",
    "moreover , our model proves that even with a high number of users , the frg can always be played with a minimum number of stages shorter than when using the goodman model .",
    "in addition , the social welfare in the drg decreases slightly with the number of users with the cross - layer approach while it decreases considerably with the goodman model .",
    "finally , the comparison of the cross - layer algorithm versus the goodman algorithm , shows that in real systems with random packet arrivals , the cross - layer power control algorithm outperforms the goodman algorithm .",
    "thus , the new op with the cross - layer approach is more efficient .",
    "an interesting extension to this work would be to consider the interference channel instead of the mac channel and generalize the framework applied here .",
    "another possible extension would be to consider the multi - carrier case and the resulting repeated game .",
    "let us determine the maximal utility that a player can get and which is denoted as follows : @xmath182    we denote @xmath183 the power maximizing the utility function @xmath184 and which is the solution of the following equation : @xmath185=0 } , \\label{a3}\\ ] ] with @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",

    "we deduce then that @xmath216 is a decreasing function of @xmath192 .",

    "<S> the main objective of this work is to improve the energy - efficiency ( ee ) of a multiple access channel ( mac ) system , through power control , in a distributed manner . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with many existing works on energy - efficient power control , which ignore the possible presence of a queue at the transmitter , we consider a new generalized cross - layer ee metric . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is relevant when the transmitters have a non - zero energy cost even when the radiated power is zero and takes into account the presence of a finite packet buffer and packet arrival at the transmitter . </S>",
    "<S> as the nash equilibrium ( ne ) is an energy - inefficient solution , the present work aims at overcoming this deficit by improving the global energy - efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as the considered system has multiple agencies each with their own interest , the performance metric reflecting the individual interest of each decision maker is the global energy - efficiency defined then as the sum over individual energy - efficiencies . repeated games ( rg ) are investigated through the study of two dynamic games ( finite rg and discounted rg ) , whose equilibrium is defined when introducing a new operating point ( op ) , pareto - dominating the ne and relying only on individual channel state information ( csi ) . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , closed - form expressions of the minimum number of stages of the game for finite rg ( frg ) and the maximum discount factor of the discounted rg ( drg ) were established . </S>",
    "<S> our contributions consist of improving the system performances in terms of powers and utilities when using the new op compared to the ne and the nash bargaining ( nb ) solution </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , the cross - layer model in the rg formulation leads to achieving a shorter minimum number of stages in the frg even for higher number of users . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the social welfare ( sum of utilities ) in the drg decreases slightly with the cross - layer model when the number of users increases while it is reduced considerably with the goodman model . </S>",
