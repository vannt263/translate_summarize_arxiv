    "the stability of a galactic disk with gas and stars was first considered in the context of stellar waves by @xcite and in the context of cloud formation by @xcite .",
    "the importance of cold gas in the general stability of a combined disk was recognized by @xcite , who also considered the effects of thickness and particle dynamics for the stars , as did @xcite .",
    "two - component disks of finite thickness were considered in more detail for the spiral wave problem by @xcite and @xcite and in the general case by @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated multiple components .    with these two - component analyses came stability parameters that determined in absolute terms when a disk was stable .",
    "for one stellar component , this is the @xcite value for the minimum velocity dispersion in the radial direction , written now as a dimensionless parameter @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite evaluated a maximum density for the stability of a one - component disk . following the two - fluid analysis by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite determined a combined @xmath1 for a two - fluid disk .",
    "a simpler form for the combined @xmath1 was written by @xcite , and recently improved by @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed disk stability using the dispersion relation at zero frequency , which is a function of wavenumber , and gave an expression that was compared to observations for spiral galaxies and dwarfs by @xcite .",
    "leroy et al . evaluated the rafikov expression assuming a range of likely wavenumbers , and showed that most radii in all of the galaxies they studied were marginally stable .",
    "this common feature suggests that galaxies regulate their stability by varying the velocity dispersions of gas and stars through star formation feedback and stellar wave scattering .",
    "an important component of disk stability that has been overlooked in these studies is the dissipation of energy in the interstellar medium .",
    "usually the gas is assumed to be isothermal or polytropic , which has a certain level of dissipation by assumption , but the nature of this dissipation is unrealistic as it implies an ever - present source of energy to accompany any decompression . on average ,",
    "lower - density gas is warmer than higher - density gas , but this relationship is established in the real ism by specific energy sources and sinks that do not automatically heat up the gas if it is driven to a lower density by gravity .",
    "a time - dependent energy equation should be used instead of an adiabatic pressure - density relation . in equilibrium , this energy equation states that heating balances cooling , but out of equilibrium , when a spiral arm or cloud begins to form in an instability , there is usually a net cooling from dissipation in turbulence . only after the spiral or cloud make stars will the energy loss be returned , but this is long after the instability has grown .",
    "recent computer simulations suggest that the primary role of star formation feedback in a galaxy model is to break apart the dense clouds that form ; turbulence on larger scales is driven by gravitational instabilities ( bournaud et al .",
    "2010 , hopkins et al .",
    "2011 , see also elmegreen et al .",
    "this means that turbulent dissipation accompanies the growth of gravitational instabilities .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce the energy equation to the interstellar component of the stability problem for a gas and star disk .",
    "we also consider thickness effects in some detail , checking the approximation often used for stability analyses with an exact integration for the gravitational acceleration in a three dimensional disk .",
    "then we discuss corrections to the commonly used stability thresholds that arise from gaseous energy dissipation .",
    "the main point is that energy dissipation changes the dispersion relation for disk instabilities in a fundamental way , removing the jeans length from the problem in some cases , and giving residual instabilities at high wavenumbers even when the toomre q parameters are large .",
    "disk thickness is a more effective stabilizer than interstellar turbulent pressure .",
    "the results have implications for the interpretation of observations , primarily in suggesting a better stability threshold when dissipation is important , and they have implications for simulations of galaxy disks . in simulations ,",
    "an equation of state for the gas has to be considered to connect density changes with pressure changes .",
    "if this equation of state is too simple , particularly if it does not reproduce the expected rapid dissipation of turbulent energy in perturbations , then the simulation is probably more stable than a real galaxy  at least on small scales .",
    "another application is to regions of galaxies where the usual stability parameters suggest a high degree of stability , such as the far - outer regions of disks , or in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the present results suggest that these regions can still be unstable at a low level as perturbations in density lead to a simultaneous increase in self - gravity and a decrease in gaseous velocity dispersion because of dissipation .",
    "such a region will collapse if dissipation operates on about a crossing time , because the pressure does not increase fast enough to overcome gravity .    in what follows , the star+gas dispersion relation is derived in section [",
    "sect : eq ] , a simple example including turbulent dissipation but without stars is discussed in section [ jeans ] , and the star+gas relation is evaluated in section [ sect : sol ] . gas and star growth rates are considered separately in section [ gss ] and together in section [ gst ] . the ratio of perturbed stellar and gaseous column densities is in section [ ratio ] .",
    "section [ thresh ] discusses dissipation corrections to the popular gas+star @xmath1 thresholds that are in the literature .",

    "the similarity between the exact and approximate curves for small @xmath35 means that the instability condition for a collisionless stellar fluid , which is derived from the dispersion relation in the limit when @xmath32 , is nearly the same as the instability condition for a fluid having the same velocity dispersion and mass column density . this is why the condition @xmath36 for stars has the constant 3.36 in it , while the condition @xmath37 for gas has the constant @xmath38 .",
    "this constant , 3.35828 , is the maximum value of @xmath39 over variations in @xmath40",
    ".    equations ( [ eq : vgr ] ) and ( [ eq : vsr ] ) contain the radial velocity , gravitational potential , and pressure .",
    "the latter two are related to the mass column density .",
    "this column density is related to velocity through the continuity equation , which is , for perturbed variables , @xmath41 @xmath42    column density is related to pressure through a time - dependent energy equation .",
    "the equation for perturbed energy , when multiplied by @xmath43 for adiabatic index @xmath44 , becomes an equation for perturbed pressure changes : @xmath45 the perturbed rate of increase of energy per unit volume is @xmath46 and the perturbed rate of decrease from radiative cooling and other effects is @xmath47 .",
    "we consider that star formation is mostly triggered by the disk instabilities that we want to study , so that before star formation begins , there is very little perturbation in the heating rate .",
    "perturbed heating might come from background supernovae , for example , and depend on the gas density so that the rate changes when the density changes .",
    "however , the heating rate from supernovae depends very weakly on density ( as @xmath48 , as may be derived from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we set the perturbed @xmath46 equal to zero .",
    "this means that the background turbulent heating rate per unit volume does not increase much as the density increases during the growth of a perturbation .",
    "cooling comes mostly from shocks in an interstellar medium that is supersonically turbulent .",
    "the cooling rate should be larger where the kinetic energy density is larger , which is where the pressure is also larger .",
    "to the extent that we can approximate the momentum flux for a supersonically turbulent fluid with the pressure term , @xmath11 , we can also approximate the dissipation time for the corresponding energy density as some number , @xmath49 , of crossing times in the perturbed region .",
    "this crossing time dependence follows from numerical simulations in @xcite and @xcite . because the crossing rate is @xmath50 , we write the dissipation rate as @xmath51 it is significant that the perturbed cooling rate peaks at the same position as the perturbed pressure , rather than at the position of peak pressure gradient",
    ". then the time dependence of the pressure in equation ( [ eq : p ] ) is in phase with the pressure itself , @xmath52 this phase coherence means that the pressure has a component to the time dependence that is exponential .",
    "there are no purely oscillatory solutions as there are for polytropic or isothermal gasses .",
    "thus we need solutions of the form @xmath53 for real @xmath17 .",
    "we also expect that for self - gravitating media there will be growing ( unstable ) solutions , in which case @xmath54 .",
    "note that the derivation of @xmath31 also requires the real part of the growth term to be positive so that an integral converges at negative infinite time ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix 6a ) .",
    "we identify @xmath17 as the growth rate of the gas+star gravitational instability .",
    "the reduction factor @xmath31 includes solutions where the time dependence is exponential . substituting @xmath55 for @xmath23 in equation ( [ eq : f ] ) , we obtain for growing perturbations , @xmath56\\right ) { \\rm sinh } ( s\\xi)\\sin\\xi d \\xi\\label{eq : f2}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the dimensionless growth rate , @xmath58 .",
    "the right - hand side of figure 1 shows @xmath31 for growing solutions .",
    "an excellent approximation is equation ( [ eq : approx ] ) , which is now written @xmath59 this approximation , shown by the dashed lines , is closer to the exact growth solution than equation ( [ eq : approx ] ) was to the oscillatory solution , equation ( [ eq : f ] ) .",
    "the dissipation term in equation ( [ eq : p ] ) has another important effect because it removes the minimum unstable length , or jeans length , from the problem for an infinitesimally thin disk .",
    "when @xmath60 , arbitrarily small perturbation lengths can dissipate turbulent energy and drive an instability .",
    "it also removes a stability condition : gas perturbations that always cool are always unstable .",
    "then there is no minimum gas column density for instability , nor is there anything analogous to a toomre @xmath1 condition for an infinitesimally thin disk .",
    "note that zero - order heating and cooling are assumed to be in equilibrium .",
    "the turbulent dissipation of zero - order pressure is balanced by energy input from background sources , such as supernovae .",
    "but to the extent that perturbed pressures driven by self - gravity always dissipate internal turbulent energy faster than they gain turbulent energy from background sources , there is an instability at all length scales . in practice",
    ", that means all length scales where the gas is supersonically turbulent .",
    "we return to this point in section [ sect : sol ] where the effects of disk thickness lead to a stability condition again .    at this point",
    "we introduce perturbation variables that clearly indicate their spatial phase dependence .",
    "we let perturbed pressure , density , column density and gravitational potential vary as @xmath61 , and we let both velocities vary as @xmath62 .",
    "all perturbed quantities varying in time as @xmath63 .",

    "this is why pressure does not enter the stability condition and why there is no minimum length in the case of turbulent dissipation like that given by equation ( [ eqheat ] ) .",
    "the final link is between column density and gravitational potential .",
    "this comes from poisson s equation for the gravitational potential and has no time dependence .",
    "the equation is three - dimensional , so the perturbed potential depends on the distribution of perturbed density perpendicular to the plane .",
    "this leads to correction factors for the mass column densities if only the two - dimensional forcing is considered .",
    "@xcite used a correction factor of @xmath69 for a one - component uniform disk between @xmath70 , while @xcite used @xmath0 from a more detailed analysis .",
    "these two factors are similar , as is the @xmath71 factor in shu ( 1968 , see vandervoort 1970 ) .",
    "the use of analogous correction factors in the two - component case was discussed by @xcite .",
    "he concluded that the correction factors can not generally be applied independently to each component , but if the vertical distributions are somewhat uncoupled , then that approximation should be all right . in this case",
    "the result is a perturbed gravitational potential that depends on the perturbed gaseous and stellar column densities with separate and independent correction factors , @xmath72 we use this approximation here . in appendix [",
    "sect : height ] , the two scale heights @xmath73 are evaluated from the equations of vertical equilibrium . in appendix",
    "[ correct ] , we check the thickness approximation in equation ( [ eq : grav ] ) by direct integration over the combined density distribution to determine the gravitational acceleration from a perturbation .",
    "the result suggests that the @xmath0 correction factors for column density are too low by @xmath74% at @xmath75 , but this is the largest error introduced by the thickness approximation for a wide range of @xmath76 and other parameters .    with equations ( [ eq : vsr2 ] ) , ( [ eq : sigmas2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : grav ] ) we can eliminate @xmath10 and @xmath77 to get an equation for perturbed @xmath78 : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath58 , @xmath81 , as defined above",

    "this expression is analogous to that in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it differs in our consideration of turbulent gas dissipation and in our use of growth solutions for the reduction factor @xmath31 .",
    "in @xcite , the instability condition for a gas+star fluid was that the right - hand side of equation ( [ dr2 ] ) , written with @xmath91 and @xmath92 in his case , had to exceed 1 in the limit of @xmath93 for some value of wavenumber @xmath40 .",
    "stability requires the right hand side to be less than 1 at @xmath93 for all wavenumbers .",
    "if @xmath91 , we have these conditions too , because then the gas term varies as @xmath94 which has a maximum value of 0.5 at @xmath95 , and then sufficiently small @xmath96 makes the right hand side larger than 1 .",
    "when @xmath60 , however , the gas term varies directly with @xmath40 when @xmath93 and there is no maximum value . the right hand side can exceed 1 for @xmath93 even for very large @xmath96 , which is normally stable , if @xmath40 is large enough .",
    "for an infinitesimally thin disk , we need @xmath97 or @xmath98 for instability in the pure gas case ( @xmath99 ) if there is perturbed gaseous energy dissipation of any magnitude , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
    "this is the same as the instability condition for a infinitesimally thin pressure - less fluid , as derived by toomre ( 1964 , eqn .",
    "the role of turbulent dissipation in the standard jeans analysis can be seen from simpler equations involving only the gas .",

    "solutions to this equation will be shown in the next section .",
    "an even simpler form is to write it for an infinitesimally thin disk without rotation in the form @xmath101 for the present discussion , we make this equation dimensionless by defining the unit of frequency - squared to be @xmath102 and the unit of wavenumber - squared to be @xmath103 ; @xmath104 is the conventional jeans wavenumber .",
    "the two - dimensional jeans equation with this normalization is @xmath105 this is a cubic equation , @xmath106 that can be solved analytically , although the steps are complicated with terms in @xmath107 up to order 6 .",
    "figure [ jeans_w_delta ] shows numerical evaluations of this analytical solution as solid lines for @xmath91 , 0.5 and 1 .",
    "the usual dispersion relation with a wavenumber limit for growth at @xmath108 is reproduced in the case of no dissipation , @xmath91 . with dissipation",
    ", the instability persists at high wavenumber .",
    "the origin of this instability is uncompensated gas cooling on @xmath49 crossing times , aided by self - gravitational contraction . in other words ,",
    "turbulent shocks dissipate energy and self - gravity then leads to collapse .",
    "figure [ jeans_w_delta ] also shows as dashed lines solutions with a dissipation rate proportional to @xmath109 , which is appropriate for a turbulent gas with a velocity dispersion proportional to the square root of the size : @xmath110 .",
    "there is still instability at high @xmath111 , but the dissipation rate for each @xmath111 is lower when there are slower motions at that @xmath111 , and so the growth rate is lower too .",
    "the rest of this paper considers only solutions with @xmath112 independent of @xmath111 , but the same shift toward lower growth rate at high @xmath111 would be present in the full solutions too if @xmath112 increased with size .",
    "the first term on the right of equation ( [ dr2 ] ) , when set equal to 1 , is the dispersion relation for pure gas , and the second term is the dispersion relation for pure stars .",
    "combined , they are the dispersion relation for stars+gas . we show each of these in the next 2 figures .",

    "both peak at dimensionless wavenumber @xmath113 and both have growth rates that increase with decreasing @xmath1 . in the case of pure gas , the effect of the dissipation term @xmath114 in equation ( [ dr2 ] ) is to stretch the range of instabilities to larger wavenumber .",
    "when @xmath91 , the growth rate goes to zero at @xmath115 for @xmath116 and at @xmath117 for @xmath118 .    in the case of pure stars ( figure [ rafikov_dispersion_gasstars ] right ) ,",

    "they also include the @xmath123 term . for comparison",
    ", the dashed green curve has @xmath124 and no scale height term .",

    "figure [ rafikov_dispersion_gasstars ] includes this case as the top blue curve ( @xmath121 ) , for confirmation ; the rest of that blue curve differs from the @xmath124 , @xmath129 case because the scale height term also has a @xmath40 dependence .",
    "that is , at increasing @xmath40 , the term @xmath119 becomes larger and the gravitating effective column density , @xmath130 , smaller , making the disk less unstable than the @xmath131 solutions .    in a second comparison ,",

    "the other studies consider instabilities in optically thick , subsonic accretion disks around protostars or active galactic nuclei .",

    "small - scale instabilities are possible in the rapidly cooled shocked regions , even if they are smaller than the jeans length at the initial velocity dispersion .",
    "the present result implies that galaxy disks may be more unstable than previously determined from models or computer simulations with isothermal or adiabatic gas .",

    "such lengths are a feature of the linear regime and may appear only in young regions that start fairly smooth .",
    "examples might be expanding shells or spiral arm shocks , which sometimes show a characteristic clump scale @xcite .      the observation by @xcite that @xmath273 for most galaxy disks in their survey implies some regulatory mechanism .",

    "85% have no perceptible long - arm spirals at 2@xmath274 in the 2mass survey @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that flocculent galaxies have more stable stellar disks than multiple arm galaxies , which means that not all @xmath5 values are the same .",
    "similarly , in a sample of 147 ohio state university bright galaxy survey galaxies less inclined than @xmath275 , the distribution function of spiral arm torques is broad and featureless , spanning a factor of @xmath276 @xcite .",
    "spiral arm morphology and strength are the most direct indicators of @xmath5 , because these structures are what gas+star instabilities make .",
    "star formation does not have such a clear connection with @xmath5 .",
    "the composite stability conditions shown in figure [ rafikov_s_vs_qgas ] illustrate the conventional notion that instabilities maintain @xmath5 at a marginally unstable value by stirring the stars and gas . if @xmath5 is small then the threshold , @xmath277 , is large and stirring is active , which lowers @xmath5 .",
    "feedback is complex for a gas+star fluid , however , because the stars do not cool .",
    "if star formation is active , then cool stars can be added continuously to the stellar population , which is like cooling @xcite , but the same instabilities also heat the old stars in proportion .",
    "stronger instabilities heat more old stars and , through cloud formation , produce more cool stars .",
    "if heating beats cooling in this proportion , then there would be no feedback to make the stars cooler if @xmath5 is too high . if cooling from new stars beats heating , then there would be no feedback to make the stars heat up if @xmath5 is too low .",
    "feedback stabilization of @xmath5 is also complex for a gas+star fluid because the cool young stars have the same velocity dispersion and mass as the gas did before the stars formed .",
    "thus the new , cool stars do not add any extra instability to the combined disk .",
    "they remove the ability to dissipate energy however , which is a stabilizing effect .",
    "persistent heating of old stars by gravitational instabilities requires more and more cool gas to maintain a marginal @xmath5 if there is regulation .",
    "this eventually leads to a gas instability that is decoupled from the star instability , i.e. , when @xmath278 .",
    "then there are two peaks in the dispersion relation , one for stars at low @xmath40 and another for gas at high @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "some flocculent galaxies could be in this regime .",
    "if the stellar @xmath133 is low , then stellar spirals form readily and the disk can not be stabilized by extra turbulence following star formation .",
    "feedback comes only from stellar heating in the waves . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath133 is high , then the combined instability shows up primarily in the gas , producing flocculent spirals and filaments of star formation .",
    "galactic gas accretion can modify @xmath5 by adding cold gas , and after star formation , by adding slow - moving stars . following a sudden influx of gas , @xmath5 should drop and a period of intense spiral arm or clump formation and star formation should begin . when the gas eventually gets converted to stars , @xmath5 should increase and the spiral arms weaken .",
    "this would be a regulatory process that does not connect @xmath5 with star formation directly but still keeps @xmath5 at a more - or - less constant value , particularly if the star formation rate is about equal to the galactic accretion rate on average .",
    "the direct role of gravitational instabilities in star formation is difficult to observe . according to @xcite , @xcite and others ,",
    "star formation only requires molecular gas , and molecular gas only requires sufficient pressure , most of which comes from the weight of the gas layer in the disk .",
    "there is nothing about cloud formation or possible instabilities that induce cloud formation in these conditions .",
    "only pressure determines the abundance of dense , star - forming clouds . @xcite and",
    "@xcite reproduce the observed radial profiles of galaxies using only the constraint that molecular clouds are shielded by atomic gas in some type of equilibrium .",
    "it is difficult to see how galactic - scale gravitational instabilities can influence these results as the instabilities operate on the total gas ( and stars ) without regard to molecular phase .",
    "if gravitational instabilities directly triggered star formation , then the primary scaling law should have a star formation rate that depends on a high power , such as 1.5 or 2 , of the total gas column density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this is apparently not observed ( however , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a review of star formation processes , see @xcite .",
    "perhaps this disconnection between star formation and gravitational instabilities makes sense in retrospect .",
    "if the gas is already highly molecular , then the conversion of a little extra atomic material into molecular material by compression in instabilities will not influence the total molecular mass and star formation rate much , nor will any rearrangement of the existing molecular clouds by the unstable motions .",
    "even cloud collisions during an instability would not affect the star formation rate if the molecular depletion time is as constant as it appears to be @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the gas is highly atomic , then instabilities could promote molecule formation if the density contrast becomes large .",
    "however , on the dominant scale of the gas+star instability , which is @xmath279 ( i.e. , @xmath184 ) , and for the dominant growth rate , @xmath280 ( i.e. , @xmath281 ) , these instabilities would only increase the density by several exponential growth factors during the available shear time .",
    "this is not enough compression to make molecular clouds .",
    "star formation has to occur in the non - linear regime of unstable growth , or independently of this growth , when the gas separates from the stars and collapses into dense molecular clouds by its own gravity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the stars that helped start the instability will have moved away in their epicycles after this time , with little long - term excess following the clumped gas .",
    "star formation also occurs after the instability causes contraction in the third dimension , considering that giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are smaller than the scale height .",
    "in addition , star formation can occur in pressurized shells and cometary structures that are unrelated to galactic - scale instabilities .",
    "the observation of a linear molecular - cloud star formation law , which suggests a secondary role for galactic - scale gravitational instabilities , combined with the observation of a weakly - varying @xmath5 , which suggests feedback - regulation of @xmath5 by gravitational instabilities that may trigger star formation , poses an interesting contradiction .",
    "evidently the role of the these instabilities in star formation is indirect .",
    "one possibility is that gravitational instabilities replenish the self - gravitating molecular gas that gets converted into diffuse gas during the star formation process . this way the molecular gas abundance remains constant on average , and",
    "the star formation rate does not scale with the cloud formation rate , but only with the current molecular abundance .",
    "an example is provided by the simulations in @xcite and @xcite , which show gravitational instabilities that form self - gravitating gas from diffuse gas , and star formation that disrupts these gravitating clouds , converting a fraction of their gas back into diffuse form .",
    "the conversion rate of diffuse gas into self - gravitating gas by galactic - scale instabilities can be much larger than the conversion rate of self - gravitating gas into stars by local collapse .",
    "a simple model for this is discussed in the next sub - section .",
    "a simple model of star formation illustrates how gravitational instabilities can play an important role in cloud formation , which is cloud re - assembly in this picture , and yet not trigger star formation directly or have a direct connection to the star formation rate . in this model , there are three phases of interstellar matter : self - gravitating clouds in which stars form and which are generally molecular , diffuse molecular clouds in which stars do not form because their density is too low , and diffuse atomic or ionized clouds , which are also too low in density to form stars .",
    "if , in a certain region their masses are @xmath282 , @xmath283 , and @xmath284 , respectively , then we can write the equations governing their changes : @xmath285 @xmath286 @xmath287 the timescales and terms in these equations are as follows .",
    "@xmath288 is the timescale for gravitational instabilities studied here . for most cases ,",
    "this is comparable to the epicyclic time , which means that @xmath281 in the dimensionless notation used above .",
    "then the first equation says that the self - gravitating mass increases on the timescale of the gravitational instability with the mass coming from diffuse gas .",
    "that is , gravitational instabilities compress all of the gas into discrete self - gravitating clouds , but the practical effect of this for star formation is to move the diffuse gas that lies between existing gmcs onto those gmcs , and to make new gmcs .",
    "@xmath289 is the duration of a single event of star formation in any one cloud , such as the lifetime of an active ob association .",
    "it should be something like 10 - 20 myr for a @xmath290 cloud .",
    "the factor @xmath291 is the fraction of a self - gravitating cloud that is converted into diffuse gas during each burst ; it might be 30% or more , considering disruption of a cluster - forming core and all of the associated ionization .",
    "it is not likely to be 100% because dense clouds are mostly pushed to the side by pressures from ionization and stellar winds , into shell - like and cometary structures , without complete disassociation into atoms . of this disruption fraction ,",
    "part of it presumably stays in molecular form but at too low a density to form stars immediately .",
    "it could be molecular h@xmath292 without much co , for example .",
    "many local diffuse clouds are in this state @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss observations of the star formation law with explicit consideration of diffuse molecular gas .",
    "it could also be in the form of gmc envelopes that are exposed to background starlight and have high ionization fractions and long magnetic diffusion times ( elmegreen 2007 ) . with this term in equation ( [ model1 ] ) , the self - gravitating mass decreases because of cloud disruption on the timescale of the individual burst .",
    "@xmath293 is the consumption time for self - gravitating gas in general .",
    "the consumption time is the total self - gravitating molecular cloud mass in a galaxy divided by the total star formation rate .",
    "it is usually measured to be @xmath272 gyr for main galaxy disks @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate is this last term , @xmath294 .",
    "there are also parameters in these equations that indicate the fractions of the various phases that convert into other phases .",
    "the parameter @xmath295 is the fraction of the gravitating cloud mass that turns into diffuse molecular gas during a burst , and @xmath296 is the fraction that turns into diffuse atomic or ionized gas ; then @xmath297 .",
    "equations ( [ model1])-([model3 ] ) can be solved numerically for the time dependence of the three phases , but the result of interest here comes more easily by considering the dominant terms . in equation ( [ model1 ] ) , the last term represents the conversion of gas into stars . because of the low efficiency of star formation , which means the large value of @xmath293 compared to @xmath289 and @xmath298 , this third term is relatively small . in that case",
    ", there is a quasi - equilibrium between the three phases in which the time derivatives are small compared to each separate term involving @xmath299 and @xmath289 . in this equilibrium , @xmath300 what we would like is a measure of how active the gravitational instabilities are in rebuilding the clouds that form stars .",
    "the building rate is @xmath301 , because the instability collects all of the gas and places it in dense clouds , which means it converts the diffuse gas into self - gravitating gas .",
    "this building rate should be compared with the star formation rate , which is @xmath302 .",
    "the ratio is @xmath303 for @xmath304 , @xmath305 gyr , and @xmath306 myr , the ratio is 15 .",
    "the point of this simple model is to show how star formation can happen in self - gravitating clouds at a fixed rate , independent of gravitational instabilities , i.e. , without direct triggering , and yet these instabilities are important in maintaining the cloud population so that this star formation processes can continue .",
    "the mass flux into self - gravitating clouds is 15 times the mass flux into stars in this example . in practice ,",
    "other processes of dense cloud formation , such as shell formation around superbubbles , will combine with gravitational instabilities to return diffuse debris back into self - gravitating clouds .",
    "there are many computer simulations of star formation in galaxy disks that contain the basic elements discussed here , namely gravitational instabilities that drive turbulence and dense cloud formation , star formation in the dense clouds with a certain fixed or density - dependent rate , and dense cloud disruption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "these generally have an equation of state for the gas that includes the heightened instability from dissipation that is discussed in the present paper .",
    "gravitational instabilities in a gas+star galaxy disk are enhanced when gas dissipation is allowed to occur during the growth of the instability . then the restoring force from pressure and the velocity dispersion",
    "are reduced during the unstable growth .",
    "this has the effect of removing the minimum wavelength ( the jeans length ) from the problem , and for a thin disk , promoting an unstable condition regardless of @xmath1 . for a thick disk ,",
    "the thickness itself is what limits or prevents instabilities by diluting self - gravity in the in - plane direction compared to the coriolis force .",
    "this paper derived the dispersion relation for small perturbations in a dissipative gas + stellar disk .",
    "the effects of disk thickness were considered in detail , including a self - consistent evaluation of the thicknesses of the two components .",
    "threshold effects for an appropriately defined parameter @xmath5 were determined and found to differ from the usual results determined without explicit inclusion of dissipation .",
    "that is , @xmath5 has to be a factor of 2 to 3 higher than the usual value of unity before a reasonably thick disk becomes significantly stable .",
    "this change implies that real galaxy disks are more unstable than previously believed .",
    "the greater instability has implications for spiral waves and cloud formation , and for feedback control of @xmath5 , which is much more complicated for a two - component disk than a one - component disk , considering that an existing stellar component can never cool .",
    "the instability also has implications for star formation laws , particularly if they suggest a linear dependence between the star formation rate and the molecular abundance .",
    "such laws would not seem to have a role for gravitational instabilities in directly triggering star formation , but they may still have a role in re - assembling the self - gravitating clouds that are torn apart by stellar feedback .",
    "the mass exchange in this assembly phase can exceed the mass flow into stars by a factor of 10 or more , indicating the importance of the instability as a component of the whole process .",

    "equation ( [ eq : grav ] ) contains an approximation for disk thickness that can be evaluated using the full solutions for the vertical density profiles just calculated .",
    "if @xmath380 is the vertical distribution of total density in a plane - parallel layer , and if this total density has a @xmath381 dependence in the direction of the perturbation , as assumed above , then the acceleration measured at position @xmath382 in the midplane in this direction is @xmath383 this comes from the acceleration @xmath384 toward a line of mass with mass per unit length @xmath385 measured at a distance @xmath386 ^ 2)^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "converting equation ( [ gx0 ] ) to dimensionless units as above , separating the gaseous and stellar parts of @xmath387 , setting @xmath388 , and using an equation like ( [ eq : grav ] ) with arbitrary correction factors @xmath389 instead of @xmath0 , we get @xmath390 note that the cosine term inside the integral gets converted to a sine term after integration , and this phase dependence is divided out by the sine in the denominator .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that a cosine variation in density produces a sine variation in gravitational acceleration , and this produces a cosine variation in the potential , which is used in equation ( [ eq : grav ] ) .",
    "the integral was evaluated for a variety of cases over the range @xmath391 and the coefficients @xmath392 were found to be good approximations .",
    "figure [ rafikov_grav2 ] shows the ratio of the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : cc ] ) to the left hand side using @xmath393 , plotted as a function of dimensionless wavenumber @xmath40 .",
    "this ratio is the correction factor that should be applied to the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : grav ] ) , or to the column densities , to make the thickness correction more accurate when the approximation @xmath0 is used .",
    "alternatively , the inverse of this correction factor can be applied to the stability parameter @xmath1 to get a more accurate stability parameter .",
    "fortunately , the correction factor is small , less than @xmath394% in all cases , and only that large near @xmath395 . in the range @xmath75 , the average correction in figure [ rafikov_grav2 ] is 12% , which means that the true acceleration that drives the instability is higher than the estimate using the potential of equation ( [ eq : grav ] ) by an average of @xmath74% .",
    "the instability growth rate scales as the square root of the acceleration per unit length , so the likely correction to the growth rate is an increase by @xmath396% . considering the other approximations used here for interstellar and stellar dynamics , this correction to the growth rate is not important .",
    "we therefore evaluate the dispersion relation using the original vandervoort approximation , as given by equation ( [ eq : grav ] ) ."
