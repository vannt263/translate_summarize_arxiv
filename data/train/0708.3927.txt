    "the case is different , however , for anisotropic space - times : considering perfect fluids is a restriction and might be misleading , since it is unclear in general , how robust the results on the behavior of perfect fluid solutions are under a change of the matter model . for example , it was shown in  @xcite that the past asymptotic behavior of bianchi type i cosmological models with collisionless matter is considerably different from that of perfect fluid models . a more systematic analysis of the problem in the case of bianchi",
    "type  i models with general anisotropic matter sources has been carried out in  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , this difference concerns the behavior of solutions in relation to the taub ( flat lrs kasner ) solution .",
    "while there exist perfect fluid solutions that are asymptotic to the taub solution as the initial singularity is approached , this behavior does not appear for solutions with anisotropic matter .",
    "results of this type have broad ramifications , since the dynamics of spatially homogeneous cosmologies are generally conjectured to be the building blocks of the asymptotic dynamics of generic cosmological models ( i.e. , models without symmetries ) , see  @xcite for a recent discussion .",
    "the taub solution plays a crucial role in this context ; essential ideas like the basic concept of kasner eras ( cf .",
    "the bkl asymptotics  @xcite ) and the advanced concept of decay rates of inhomogeneities for generic models are connected with the taub solution .",
    "in fact , the taub solution already plays a crucial role in the treatment of mixmaster dynamics , see  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore essential to see in which respect the dynamics of solutions toward the singularity is dependent on the choice of matter model , and whether the role of the taub solution changes in this context .",
    "a systematic analysis of this problem in the case of bianchi type  i cosmological models has been carried out in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we widen the analysis of  @xcite of the dynamics of cosmological models with elastic matter ; the elastic matter model we consider is taken from  @xcite .",
    "this matter model is particularly suitable for our aims , since it contains perfect fluids as a limiting case and thus allows to directly compare the behavior of anisotropic matter solutions ( elastic solutions ) with the behavior of perfect fluid solutions . in  @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the asymptotics toward the singularity of elastic solutions is fundamentally different from that of perfect fluids : the approach to the singularity is oscillatory , hence , in particular , there do not exist any solutions that approach the taub solution in the asymptotic limit . in this paper we study the past and future asymptotic behavior of elastic models for the locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) bianchi type  i case in full detail .",
    "in particular , we present a detailed analysis of the oscillatory behavior of the scale factors that determine the metric , and we describe the dependence of the amplitude of the oscillations on the properties of the elastic material ; see  section  [ pastsection ] .",
    "( as we show in  @xcite , oscillations in the past asymptotics of bianchi type  i solutions are due to an ` overcritical ' violation of the energy conditions in a neighbourhood of the initial singularity ; we refer to the concluding remarks . )    in addition to the dynamics toward the initial singularity we consider the dynamics of elastic cosmologies in the low density regime , i.e. , the future asymptotic behavior of models .",
    "also in this context we observe a fundamental difference between elastic solutions and perfect fluid solutions : although isotropization occurs for all solutions , the isotropization rates of elastic models differ considerably from those of perfect fluid solutions .",
    "this remains true even in the case when the anisotropy properties of the elastic material are small and the elastic matter thus resembles a perfect fluid very closely ; see  section  [ futuresection ] .",
    "the methods we use in this paper are methods from the theory of dynamical systems , see , e.g. ,  @xcite . in section  [ setup ]",
    "we begin by briefly discussing the dynamical systems formulation for bianchi type  i elastic space - times .",
    "this approach is described in  @xcite in more detail ; here , however , we adapt the formulation to our present purposes . throughout the paper we use unit such that @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "there exist two different solutions , the non - flat lrs kasner solution @xmath6 , and the taub solution @xmath7 .",

    "relativistic elasticity is used in both relativistic astrophysics and cosmology , see , e.g. ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "an elastic material is specified by a constitutive equation ( lagrangian ) that depends on scalar functions constructed from the configuration map between the space - time and the natural ( unstrained ) state of the material ; the stress - energy tensor @xmath22 is then obtained as the variation w.r.t .  the space - time metric of the matter action . in particular , this",

    "we give a complete derivation of the energy density   and the principal pressures   for our particular choice of elastic matter and initial data .",
    "the constant @xmath26 we call _ elastic constant_. it measures the response of the elastic material to anisotropies ; when @xmath29 , the elastic material reduces to a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the elastic material under consideration contains , as a special case , the perfect fluid model most widely used in cosmology , see  @xcite . by  - ,",
    "there are two regimes in which elastic matter can be viewed as a small perturbation of a perfect fluid : when @xmath31 ( small shear ) or when @xmath32 ( almost isotropic geometry ) .",
    "this observation implies that there are indeed regimes where the energy distribution of a perfect fluid and of elastic matter are effectively indiscernible . yet , as we will see , these models give rise to a rather different dynamical behavior of the space - time metric in the limits toward the initial singularity and for late times .",
    "the einstein equations for a metric of the type   with stress - energy tensor   form a system of odes for the variables @xmath33 ; in addition there is one constraint equation .",
    "it is preferable , however , to replace @xmath33 by scale - invariant variables to obtain a dynamical systems formulation of the equations on a compact state - space . to this end",

    "we investigate the future and past asymptotics of elastic models in detail .",
    "the analysis of the future asymptotic dynamics is based on an investigation of the dynamical system   in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point @xmath85 .",

    "we see that , therefore , the generic late - time behavior of ( non - isotropic ) solutions with elastic matter is considerably different from the behavior of ( non - isotropic ) perfect fluid solutions .",
    "since this is despite the fact that the material properties of the elastic matter resemble those of a perfect fluid , this result is interesting .    in astrophysical applications , such as the modeling of relativistic stars , replacing perfect fluid matter by elastic matter yields a family of models that includes the perfect fluid solutions as special cases ( which are obtained by simply letting the elastic constants go to zero , see  @xcite ) .",

    "are recovered by letting the elastic constant @xmath214 . in the cosmological context",
    "this is no longer true ; as shown in this paper , the isotropization rates of elastic solutions are qualitatively different from those of perfect fluid solutions    the past asymptotics of elastic models is also interesting .",
    "while perfect fluid solutions converge to either the taub solution or the non - flat lrs solution , elastic models oscillate between these two states .",
    "oscillatory behavior toward the initial singularity is well - known in the context of certain bianchi cosmologies , most notably in bianchi types  viii and  ix .",
    "this asymptotic behavior is usually referred to as the mixmaster behavior .",
    "however , mixmaster oscillations are absent when lrs symmetry is imposed : lrs solutions simply approach the taub solution or the non - flat lrs solution .",
    "this is in stark contrast to behavior of elastic models analyzed in the present paper .",
    "these models exhibit oscillations despite the fact that they are lrs models .",
    "elsewhere we show in more detail that there is no evident connection between elastic oscillations and mixmaster oscillations  @xcite .",

    "@xcite we consider the case of generic ( in fact , diagonal ) bianchi type  i models , and we find an intricate network of oscillations that determine the past asymptotic behavior of these elastic cosmologies .",
    "again , this chaotic oscillatory approach to the singularity is fundamentally different from the mixmaster behavior .",
    "despite the fact that elastic oscillations are not directly connected with mixmaster oscillations , there might exist interesting consequences when one considers more general elastic models than bianchi type  i. consider , e.g. , elastic models of bianchi type  viii or  ix , say . in this case we expect mixmaster behavior , which is characterized by oscillations between epochs where the behavior is close to the behavior of bianchi type  i models .",
    "since already the bianchi type  i models are oscillatory , as shown here and in  @xcite , we might be confronted with a hierarchy of oscillations , i.e. , oscillations between oscillations , where mixmaster oscillations connect epochs of elastic oscillations .",
    "whether this is indeed true remains to be investigated .",
    "although it is not the purpose of this paper to propose elastic matter as a physically realistic matter model for the universe , we would like to conclude this paper by commenting on the ` physics ' of elastic matter and elastic cosmologies .",
    "we have seen that the asymptotic behavior toward the initial singularity of elastic cosmological models differs qualitatively ( and not merely quantitatively ) from that of perfect fluid models .",
    "this is hardly surprising , since the differences in the material properties of elastic matter and perfect fluid matter are most significant under extreme conditions , such as those found in the proximity of a singularity",
    ". one could expect that a description of matter as a solid elastic body might not be completely unrealistic under these conditions  elastic matter is also used in the modeling of compact stellar objects like neutron stars .",
    "however , we note that the dynamics toward the singularity of the elastic cosmologies under study are connected with the violation of energy conditions . the dominant energy condition reads @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "this condition is violated in a neighborhood of the boundaries @xmath217 and @xmath66 of the state space ; to see this we observe that @xmath218 hence , by continuity , there is a neighborhood of the sets @xmath219 and @xmath220 in the phase space where the dominant energy condition is violated , see the shadowed region in figure  [ lrspicture ] ; when @xmath221 , this region becomes smaller and smaller ( and eventually reduces to the empty set for @xmath29 ) .",
    "note that we only have directional dominant energy condition violation , i.e. , only one of the normalized principal pressures ( either @xmath55 or @xmath222 ) is bigger than one . in particular ,",
    "the isotropic pressure , @xmath223 always satisfies @xmath224 .",
    "the violation of energy conditions is thus much milder than in the context of phantom fields or similar models .",
    "in contrast to energy condition violation toward the singularity , at late times the dominant energy condition is always satisfied .",
    "in fact , for every solution , the energy conditions are satisfied for all times larger than some given time .",
    "( for a sufficiently small elastic constant @xmath26 , the energy conditions are satisfied already after planck s time . ) finally , let us draw the reader s attention to  @xcite , where a close connection between energy condition violation and oscillatory singularities is established .    in general",
    ", it is unrealistic to expect that the description of the matter as an elastic material  represented by the constitutive equation of state  remains true under extreme stresses . under extreme conditions the material will loose its elastic properties and its behavior might deviate considerably from the one described . for instance",
    ", the assumption of a constitutive equation of state of the quasi - hookean form is typically justified only under the condition of small shear , see  @xcite , and hence violated if the shear scalar @xmath225 , cf .",
    ", becomes too large ; this occurs when the variable @xmath100 is too close to @xmath226 or @xmath227 ( which characterises for the approach to the singularity ) .",
    "it is thus to be expected that the description of a material as elastic has a limited range of validity  it breaks down before the singularity is reached .",
    "clearly , a modification of the material s properties under extreme conditions will lead to different asymptotic behavior of the associated cosmological models .",
    "we refrain from investigating these issues further here since any modification of the matter properties seems rather ad hoc rather than based on sound physical considerations",
    ". however , we refer to  @xcite , where we consider more general anisotropic matter sources .",
    "the observed results on the long - term evolution of elastic cosmological models are completely independent of the above considerations , especially since we study elastic matter whose material properties are almost indistinguishable from those of perfect fluids .",
    "let us reemphasize that we do not propose elastic matter as a physically realistic matter model for the universe ; however , the results bear relevance on our general understanding of the physics of cosmological models .",
    "the isotropization rates of elastic cosmological models differ from those of perfect fluid models even in the case where the material properties of the elastic matter deviate from those of perfect fluid matter by an arbitrarily small amount .",
    "whether the difference in isotropization rates found here carries over to more general cosmological models with more general matter sources remains to be seen .",
