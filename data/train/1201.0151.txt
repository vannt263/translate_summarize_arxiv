    "the enigmatic neutrino has generated great deal of interest in cosmology for a long time . regarding the number of neutrino species e.g. ,",
    "calculation of primordial nuclear abundances in cosmology had arrived at the number of neutrino species @xmath1 @xcite long before it was experimentally established at cern@xcite ; the current value is @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "similar calculations set the baryon to photon ratio at @xmath3 , which in turn has determined the present baryon density in the universe to be @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the present baryon density in units of the critical density , and h is the present value of the hubble parameter in units of @xmath6 , that is expected to be @xmath7@xcite . writing the present neutrino density as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the average rest - mass of the three species neutrino in @xmath10 , it is easily seen that the  @xmath11 neutrino will close the universe ; this closure mass is referred to as the cowsik - mcclelland bound@xcite , although in their paper they had used a smaller value of @xmath12 and four component neutrino to arrive at @xmath13 .",
    "tremain and gunn @xcite set the limit that a neutrino of @xmath14 can not reside in the halo of galaxy to contribute significantly to the dark matter .",
    "bond et al @xcite calculated the maximum jeans mass for structures of neutrino to be @xmath15 , where @xmath9 is the neutrino mass in ev .",
    "as recent results show that the mass difference between neutrino species is very slight , @xmath16 , in this paper , we consider three neutrino species of similar mass .",
    "comparing the baryon and neutrino densities , we see that even a @xmath17 neutrino will have dominated over baryon by now . rather than whether the neutrino is massive",
    ", the question at present is how massive it is ; again cosmology provides the most stringent limit @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "so the neutrino appears as a very important component of the universe .",
    "consequently , it should have a strong bearing on structure formation .",
    "it decouples at very early times , and then evolves as a totally independent component that interacts only gravitationally .",
    "indeed the filamentary structures , sheets , walls and voids as exposed by various surveys point towards dissipationless collapse of clouds of particles like neutrinos into zeldovich pancakes@xcite at some stage of evolution .",
    "although the cosmological neutrino has been studied extensively , we feel that our analysis gives some further insight on structure formation , particularly at what temperature the structures are more likely to form and spectrum of the size / mass of the structures at various temperatures .",
    "the momentum of a freely moving particle in the friedmann - robertson - walker spacetime is redshifted by the expansion , i.e. , the comoving momentum @xmath19 remains constant , where @xmath20 is the momentum and @xmath21 the scale factor .",
    "using @xmath22 for the velocity and the einstein energy - momentum relation , @xmath23 , we see that @xmath24 remains constant during expansion , and as the number density scales as @xmath25 , @xmath26 also remains constant where @xmath27 is the density .",
    "as the light neutrinos decouple at the very high temperature of @xmath28 while still extremely relativistic ( er ) , they are essentially in free fall since then .",
    "so their number density is always distributed as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the number of spin degeneracy ( six , for the three @xmath31 pairs ) , and we have used the fact that @xmath32 ; planck units in which @xmath33 are used throughout this work . as @xmath34 in the extreme relativistic ( er ) regime ,",
    "eq.([1.1 ] ) represents the fermi - dirac distribution . in the non - relativistic ( nr ) case",
    "however , @xmath35 , and eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] )  is no more a fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "integrating dn over @xmath36 from @xmath37 to @xmath38 gives the number density + @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the gamma and eta functions respectively@xcite ; also , @xmath42 .",
    "thus we can write down the expectation value of any regular function as @xmath43 .",
    "the width of the momentum distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : momtmdist ] is characterized by @xmath44 where the distribution is maximum .",
    "some other characteristic values that we will use are the mean @xmath45 , the root - mean square @xmath46,the harmonic mean @xmath47 , and the root harmonic mean square @xmath48 are also useful to describe the width of the distribution .",
    "the particle speed is @xmath49 . in the er case as @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath51  giving @xmath52 ; also , @xmath53 .",
    "three averages of v are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : averagevel ] .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath54 is the more representative speed in the er regime . these ideas can be used for a bosonic system as well by replacing @xmath41 with @xmath55 .",
    "but @xmath56 , so @xmath57 , indicative of the liability of bosons to condense into a zero momentum state .",
    "although a zero momentum state is strictly forbidden for a fermionic system , as @xmath58 , a low momentum condensate characterized by the harmonic mean values is possible .",
    "the rms energy is given by @xmath59 , and another characteristic value of the energy is the velocity averaged momentum @xmath60 . obviously , as @xmath61 .",
    "any macroscopic quantity that depends on the momentum distribution will be sensitive to the averaging process",
    ". this will be even more so in the relativistic regime . in this paper",
    ", we look into such effects and investigate the possible distribution of the sizes of neutrino structures .",
    "in particular , we would like to determine whether smaller neutrino structures could have formed in the very early universe . in the next section",
    ", we apply these ideas to the gravitating neutrino spheres , and compare the distributions of keplerian , virial and jeans and the free streaming scales .",
    "the jeans mass that is contained within the jeans radius , @xmath62 , has the momentum dependence @xcite ,    @xmath63    where the constant @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the planck mass , x = ma",
    "= m / t and y = pa = p / t .",
    "any gas cloud of radius greater than @xmath66 will contain a mass greater than @xmath67 , in which case gravitation can overcome the free streaming motion of the neutrinos to produce a collapse .",
    "this analysis can be used for any or all the components of the universe , and here we will apply it to the neutrino .",
    "these characteristic length and mass scales , being dependent on the momentum distribution , are sensitive to the averaging process .    j.r . bond _ _ et al__@xcite calculated @xmath67 by comparing the pressure and the density as @xmath68 , which was found to peak at @xmath69 .",
    "this expression may be appropriate in the gravitational collapse of a mass of a gas against its internal pressure , but the neutrinos are free - streaming since decoupling . thinking that @xmath70 is the fundamental quantity that determines the jeans scale , we calculated @xmath71 and found the peak to be at @xmath72 .",
    "we can also find the average of the jeans mass as @xmath73 with peak at 5.0 , and represent some characteristic values analytically by @xmath74 with peak at 4.2 , and @xmath75 with peak at 1.9 .",
    "plot of these values are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : jms ] .",
    "the values of x at which these @xmath67 s peak are given in the table  [ tab : jms ] .",
    "the results show quite a wide variations in the jeans mass ranging across a magnitude .",
    "also the time when these structures can form , determined by x , varies from 1.9 to 5 .",
    "in essence two groups of neutrino structures could appear : the smaller one at @xmath76 when the neutrino are still quite relativistic with @xmath77 , and the ten times larger one at @xmath78 when the neutrinos have become non - relativistic with @xmath79 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the above analysis , it is seen that the large - scale structures of neutrinos of different mass and random velocity distribution can form at different neutrino temperatures , corresponding to different time .",
    "the earliest peak that occurs at x = 1.9 corresponds to the time when the neutrino temperature was 1220 k for the 0.2 ev neutrino .",
    "similarly , the latest peak occurs at x = 9.58 corresponding to a temperature of 242 k. in between these two values , it is found that the jeans mass peaks at a number of different x. thus it can be interpreted to mean that a distribution of neutrino structures of different masses and of different ages should be in existence .",
    "typical masses of these structures range from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "it is well known that free streaming of collisionless particles wipe out any structures that form . in this context",
    ", there are other two scales that are relevant .",
    "the first is the particle horizon @xmath82 occurring at the distance to which light would travel since the big bang .",
    "the comoving particle horizon can be written as @xmath83    no massive particle can cover a distance larger than this . the other is the freestreaming length @xmath84 , the distance a particle travels since the big bang ; it is given by an expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rp2xirh ] ) , but including the particle speed @xmath85 inside the integral :    @xmath86    @xmath87    any scale that is smaller than @xmath84 will be wiped out by free streaming . the integral eq .",
    "( [ eq : rf2xirh ] ) in our case , for different values of @xmath88 , can be written as jacobian elliptic functions @xcite    @xmath89    considering the flat case where @xmath90 , the solution is @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . a plot of @xmath94 is shown in fig .",
    "-  [ fig : rf2xirh01 ] for three different mean values of y. this free streaming length is seen to saturate to the values of 4.193 , 3.899 and 2.555 as @xmath95 , when evaluated with @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively .    for non - flat universe ,",
    "@xmath99 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rf2xirh ] ) and  ( [ eq : rf2xirf - flat ] ) with @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "plots of @xmath99 for @xmath103 , are found to saturate to 2.883 , 2.113 and 1.690 , for the three means of y ; and in the closed universe of @xmath104 , the free streaming length saturates to 2.683 ,  1.908 and 1.495 for the respective means of y. the nature of the curves are similar to that of flat ones .",
    "from above analysis , it is seen that the large - scale structures of neutrinos of different mass and random velocity distribution can form at different neutrino temperatures , corresponding to different time .",
    "the earliest peak that occurs at x = 1.9 corresponds to the time when the neutrino temperature was 1220 k for the 0.2 ev neutrino .",
    "similarly , the latest peak occurs at x = 9.58 corresponding to a temperature of 242 k. in between these two values , it is found that the jeans mass peaks at a number of different x and hence it can be interpreted to mean that a distribution of neutrino structures of different masses and of different ages should be in existence .",
    "typical masses of these structures range from @xmath105 .",
    "these are in the order of very large super - clusters which formed first in the hot dark matter scenario .",
    "but we should note that as the universe cools down , and x becomes large , the scale of these structures will come down because the leading term in the jeans mass , eq .",
    "( [ jeansmass ] ) goes as @xmath106 .",
    "thus for 1 ev neutrino at the present temperature of 1.96 k ( @xmath107 ) , the jeans mass comes down to the galactic scale .",
    "accordingly , the large superclusters that formed initially would have fragmented to the galactic size .",
    "thus the massive neutrino can play a very important role in the formation of structures .",
    "these particles decouple from the rest of matter at a very early time when the temperature was  1 mev . since then they have been cooling down independently without interacting with other matter except gravitation .",
    "so the evolution of this component can be considered to occur separately .",
    "we have done the jeans analysis taking into account only neutrino .",
    "the results show the possibility of different sizes of neutrino structures forming at different time .",
    "in particular , two distinct sizes make their appearance : the smaller ones which could form at relatively higher temperature of @xmath108 when the neutrinos were still relativistic , and the ten time bigger ones that form when @xmath109 .",
    "as these neutrino structures have a mass of order of @xmath110 , these are indeed very large , in the scale of large super - clusters .",
    "the jeans mass at lower temperature is of the order of galaxy . in this work we have considered the neutrino as a totally independent component of the universe that interacts with nothing except gravitation with each other . in reality ,",
    "these neutrino interact gravitationally with the rest of the matter .",
    "so in any volume , there is more matter than just neutrino that is trying to bring about a gravitational collapse .",
    "hence the actual scale at which the neutrino could begin to collapse should be smaller than the value we have derived .",
