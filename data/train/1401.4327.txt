    "the notion of fractals found its applicability in high energy physics through the self - similar nature of hadron multiparticle production processes @xcite .",
    "the fractal characters of hadrons had also been pursued within a specific quark model @xcite .",
    "dremin and levtchenko @xcite first noted the relevance of these ideas in the contemporary physics of deep inelastic scattering .",
    "however , it was lastovicka @xcite who brought further attention to this notion when he proposed a relevant formalism and suggested a functional form of the structure function @xmath2 valid at small _ x_. in recent years , the formalism was further analyzed phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "+ in the present work , we explore the possibility of froissart saturation @xcite in the self - similarity based model of the proton , as it has attracted attention in the recent literature @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in the conventional qcd evolution equations , like the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) @xcite and balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) @xcite approaches , this limit is violated ; while in the dglap approach the small-_x _ gluons grow faster than any power of @xmath3 @xcite , in the bfkl approach it grows as a power of @xmath4 @xcite .",

    "we then argued that the logarithmic growth in @xmath59 is not compatible with the original self - similarity based model of ref.@xcite .",

    "( [ eqn : h_froissart ] ) .",
    "+ it is also to be noted that the case @xmath61 , considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , fits just as well as the case when @xmath62 is allowed to vary in the fit to the data , so the essential _ x _ dependence in @xmath63 comes from the @xmath64 term in the model corresponding to the correlation term of the tmd of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : logfi ] ) .",
    "+ plausible dynamics beneath the froissart bound have already been suggested in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that if a new process like gluon recombination starts @xcite , the number of small-_x _ gluons might saturate to a limit compatible with the froissart bound .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite falls short of accommodating such dynamics explicitly , as does the present work .",
    "however , the introduction of the new function @xmath65 [ with the explicit representation given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : h_froissart ] ) ] indicates a plausible way of parametrizing such effects in the modified version of the model .",
    "the physical significance of @xmath65 is just this .",
    "+ in this work , we have taken the notion of self - similarity merely as a basis to parametrize the tmd pdf , the parton distribution function , and eventually the structure function @xmath63 at small _",
    "x_. however , the variable in which the supposed fractal scaling of the quark distribution and @xmath66 occurs is not known from the underlying theory . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the choice of @xmath20 is presumably because of the power - law form of the quark distribution at small _ x _ found in the glck - reya - vogt ( grv ) distribution @xcite .",
    "however , this form is not derived theoretically or from data , but rather follows from the power - law distribution in _ x _ assumed for the input quark distribution used by the grv distribution @xcite for the qcd evolution .",
    "the choice of @xmath20 as the proper scaling variable is therefore not established from the underlying theory . + a more plausible variable appears instead to be @xmath67 ( as has been used in the function of ref.@xcite ) , which is consistent with the behavior of very high - energy interactions . in this case , when the self - similar tmd @xmath68 of quark flavor _",
    "i _ is defined by the simple scaling variable @xmath67 , it will have the form @xmath69 causing the pdf defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : qi_int ] ) to be @xmath70^{d_{i } } \\ , q^{2 } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the proportionality constant .",
    "+ the pdf and hence the structure function will be trivially compatible with the froissart bound @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "+ a similar replacement in lastovicka s parametrization with two magnification factors @xmath74 and @xmath75 would result in @xmath76 and the subsequent pdf becomes @xmath77 for very small _ x _ and large @xmath56 , the second term of eq . ( [ eqn : qi_tilde ] ) can be neglected , leading to @xmath78 which satisfies the froissart saturation condition if @xmath79 within @xmath80 corrections .",
    "the structure function will also have a similar result . +",
    "thus the original model of ref.@xcite has two features :    1 .",
    "the froissart saturation condition is satisfied only with @xmath80 corrections .",
    "2 .   the parameters @xmath64 and/or @xmath62 themselves should be @xmath56 dependent so that the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eqn:28 ] ) is @xmath56 independent .    in order to obtain the exact froissart saturation condition without @xmath81 corrections , the correlation parameter @xmath64 should be vanishingly small @xmath82 , in which case the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ eqn:28 ] ) will be @xmath56 independent as well . + on the other hand , it could also be argued that in order to have froissart - like behavior the confinement scale should enter in the description .",
    "however , the notion of confinement is completely absent in the present approach . one possible way to incorporate such a scale is presumably through the redefinition of the scaling variable involving virtuality @xmath56 , as has been done in ref.@xcite for the running coupling constant @xmath83",
    ". it will be interesting to study the consequences of the model in the future by suitably incorporating the confinement scale as well .",
