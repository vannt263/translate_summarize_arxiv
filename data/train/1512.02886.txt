    "superposition and entanglement are the distinguished properties of the quantum theory . entangled pure quantum states",
    "are defined as states that can not be factorized into product of pure states of subsystems .",
    "entanglement has attracted much interest since it is a essential feature underlying quantum information , cryptography and quantum computation  @xcite . there",
    "exist several sources of entangled quantum systems , such as in solid state physics , quantum optics and also atoms in cavity electrodynamics .",
    "many ways were proposed in order to generate entangled states in systems of two - level atoms interacting with a bosonic field .",
    "see for example  @xcite .    in a seminal paper , yu and eberly studied the radiative processes of entangled two - level atoms coupled individually to two spatially separated cavities  @xcite .",
    "a different scenario was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work ,",
    "radiative processes of a quantum system composed by two identical two - level atoms interacting with a massless scalar field prepared in the vacuum state in the presence of perfect reflecting flat boundaries were analyzed .",
    "the authors investigated the spontaneous transitions rates from the entangled states to its collective ground state induced by vacuum fluctuations . in the presence of a single boundary the transition rate for the symmetric state undergoes a strong reduction , whereas for the antisymmetric state the results",
    "indicate a slightly enhancement . following the discussion by ackerhalt , knight and eberly  @xcite , which presents the possibility to interpret spontaneous decay as a radiation - reaction effect , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have discussed quantum entanglement between inertial atoms within the formalism developed by dalibard , dupont - roc , and cohen - tannoudji ( ddc )  @xcite .",
    "as discussed by milonni the effects of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction depend on a particular ordering chosen for commuting atomic and field operators  @xcite .",
    "the ddc formalism asserts that there is a unique way in which such distinct contributions to the rate of change of an atomic observable are separately hermitian and hence they enjoy an independent physical meaning .",
    "this is achieved by choosing a preferred operator ordering , namely a symmetric ordering of commuting atom and field variables .",
    "within such a formalism the interplay between vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction can be considered to maintain the stability of the atom in its ground state .",
    "we remark that this formalism was employed in many situations  @xcite . for uniformly accelerated atoms",
    ", we remark that this method motivates in a quantitative sense the intuitive scenario outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently there has been an extensive literature devoted to investigations of quantum information theory within the framework of quantum field theory and quantum field theory in curved space - time .",
    "this emerging field of relativistic quantum information has been attracting increasing interest within the scientific community . in its essence",
    ", this subject aims at understanding the role that relativistic settings play in quantum information processes . in some way , familiar notions in quantum information theory claim for a critique reappraisal when one brings up relativistic considerations .",
    "even though we do not intend to give an extensive bibliography of the subject , here we call attention on some of such important works . for instance , in reference  @xcite it was shown that entangled states reduce to separable states at infinite acceleration .",
    "this phenomenon is sometimes called unruh decoherence and is closely related to the unruh effect  @xcite .",
    "the idea is that the acceleration of the observer causes a sort of enviromental decoherence which narrows the fidelity of certain processes of primary importance in quantum information .",
    "relationships between entanglement and space - time curvature were investigated in ref .",
    "the degradation phenomenon of entanglement in a schwarzschild black hole was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "in contrast to this effect , in references  @xcite the authors considered a situation of tripartite entanglement in which one of the three entities moves with a uniform acceleration with respect to the others ; their results indicate that entanglement does not completely vanish in the infinite acceleration limit . in turn ,",
    "generation of quantum entanglement between two localized causally disconnected atoms was studied in references  @xcite .",
    "similar results were found in references  @xcite , but with different setups and within distinct scenarios .",
    "we also mention investigations of quantum teleportation between noninertial observers  @xcite , relativistic approaches to the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) construction and also to bell s inequality  @xcite , epr - type correlations in quantum fields  @xcite and entanglement in fermionic fields  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite for more interesting discussions on the subject of relativistic quantum entanglement . as a general source for relativistic quantum information",
    "we also refer the reader the ref .",
    "@xcite which also indicates some open problems in such a research field .",
    "various aspects of this important research topic are reviewed in the special issue of _ classical and quantum gravity _ [ * 29 * ( 22 ) ( 2012 ) ] .",
    "one of the most important implications of such studies is the realization of the observer - dependency property of quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "hence a quantitative understanding of such phenomena is highly required in discussions on certain quantum information processes between accelerated members of a system .    in the description of the dynamics of a system",
    "coupled to a reservoir different formalisms have been used .",
    "generally the reservoir is described by an infinitely many degrees - of - freedom formalism .",
    "the standard framework is the traditional master equation approach .",
    "the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the atoms is usually written in the kossakowski - lindblad form . within this approach it is possible to quantify the degree of entanglement of a particular state . here since we are interested in apprehending the machinery responsible for generation ( or degradation ) of entanglement in radiative processes involving atoms , we choose a different route and use the ddc formalism aforementioned .",
    "moreover , this formalism easily enables one to discuss classical and quantum mechanical concepts .",
    "hence in the present paper we propose to generalize the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in which the authors investigate quantum entanglement between two uniformly accelerated atoms with the same acceleration . being more specific , we assume that both atoms travel in different hyperbolic trajectories .",
    "we consider that both atoms are coupled to a quantum electromagnetic field .",
    "in addition , we intend to identify the role of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction in the radiative processes of entangled atoms in uniformly accelerated motion .    the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we discuss the implementation of the ddc formalism in the situation of interest . in section  [ atom ]",
    "we calculate in detail the distinct contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the rate of variation of atomic energy in vacuum for atoms moving along different hyperbolic trajectories .",
    "specific discussion regarding the obtained results is given .",
    "conclusions and final remarks are given in section  [ conclude ] .",
    "the paper includes appendices containing details of lengthy derivations . in this paper",
    "we use units @xmath0 .",
    "we are using the minkowski metric @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "all graphics were drawn using the mathematica package .",
    "let us suppose the case of two identical two - level atoms interacting with a common electromagnetic field .",
    "we are working in a four - dimensional minkowski space - time . in this paper",
    "we work in the multipolar coupling scheme which means that all interactions are realized through the quantum electromagnetic fields .",
    "this formalism is suitable for describing retarded dipole - dipole interactions between the atoms .",
    "let us consider that such atoms are moving along different hyperbolic trajectories in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "in this case , the atoms are said to be rindler observers .",
    "as well known , the rindler metric @xmath5 is the metric seen by an uniformly accelerated observer .",
    "rindler coordinates @xmath6 and minkowski coordinates @xmath4 are related by the known relations  @xcite & & x_1 = a^-1e^aa + & & t = a^-1e^aa , [ acc ] where @xmath7 is a positive constant and @xmath8 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath6 cover only a quadrant of minkowski space , namely the wedge @xmath9 .",
    "lines of constant @xmath10 are straight , whereas lines of constant @xmath11 are hyperbolae : @xmath12 these represent world lines of uniformly accelerated observers .",
    "one has that the ( constant ) proper acceleration is given by a e^-a = .",
    "thus , different ( but constant ) @xmath11 s correspond to different hyperbolae and hence to different proper accelerations .",
    "the accelerated observers proper time @xmath13 is related to @xmath14 by = e^a .",
    "[ propt ] this implies that in general , the atoms will be moving along different world lines , so there will be two different proper times parameterizing each of these curves .",
    "we remark that the quantity @xmath7 remains the same for both atoms in this situation .    here",
    "we would like to identify the distinct contributions of quantum field vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the entanglement dynamics of the atoms . as discussed above , we consider both atoms on different stationary trajectories @xmath15 , where again @xmath16 denotes the proper time of the atom @xmath17 .",
    "usually one employs the proper time in order to describe time evolution of the atom - field system since it is directly measurable by the clocks of the observers . here , because the atoms are moving along distinct hyperbolic trajectories , one has two proper times .",
    "however , to derive the heisenberg equations of motion of the coupled system , we have to choose a common time variable .",
    "this implies that a certain amount of care is required when choosing the parameter which will describe the time evolution of the system . at first sight , it is most reasonable to refer generally to one of the atom s proper time @xmath18 and then relate the other proper time @xmath19 with @xmath18 . at any rate ,",
    "an alternative simple choice is also available , namely a coordinate time . in the present context",
    ", one could choose the minkowski coordinate time .",
    "nevertheless , as will become clear throughout the text , a more sensible path is to adopt the rindler coordinate time @xmath10 .",
    "hence , in what follows we describe the time evolution with respect to such a parameter which , because of  ( [ propt ] ) , has a functional relation with each of the proper times of the atoms .    the stationary trajectories guarantees that the undisturbed atomic system has stationary states which in our particular case are given by equation  ( [ sta ] ) . within the multipolar coupling approach the purely atomic part of the total hamiltonian describes the free hamiltonian of two two - level atoms .",
    "the hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of this atomic system with respect to @xmath10 can then be written as h_a ( ) & = & , [ ha ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 being the ground states of the atoms isolated from each other and @xmath24 and @xmath25 their respective excited states .",
    "the space of the free two - atom system is spanned by four product states with respective energies & & e_gg = -_0|gg= |g_1|g_2 , + & & e_ge= 0|ge= |g_1|e_2 , + & & e_eg = 0|eg= |e_1|g_2 , + & & e_ee = _ 0|ee= |e_1|e_2 , [ sta ] where a tensor product is implicit . instead of working with this product - state basis , we can conveniently choose the bell state basis . in terms of the product states ,",
    "one has :     maximally entangled two - qubit bell states , and they form a convenient basis of the two - qubit hilbert space . even though we consider identical atoms we are employing the above notation in order to allow the possibility of a straighforward generalization of our results to the case of non - identical atoms .",
    "furthermore , we remark that the bell states @xmath26 are not eigenstates of the atomic hamiltonian @xmath27 .    here",
    "we consider that the two - atom system is coupled with an electromagnetic field . by exploring the gauge invariance of the electromagnetic lagrangian",
    ", we impose the transversality condition ( the coulomb gauge ) . upon the usual decomposition of the electric and magnetic field operators in terms of creation and annihilation operators ( t,*x * ) & = & _ d^3 k _ ( * k * ) , ( t,*x * ) & = & _ d^3 k(*k*_(*k * ) ) the electromagnetic field hamiltonian @xmath28 $ ] acquires the traditional form h_f(t ) = _ _ * k*a^_*k*,(t)a_*k*,(t ) , [ hf ] where @xmath29 are the creation and annihilation operators of the electromagnetic field and we have neglected the zero - point energy .",
    "the index @xmath30 labels different polarizations of the field : the orthonormal vectors @xmath31 , @xmath32 correspond to the two polarization states of the photon .",
    "these obey known relations that can be found in many textbooks , see for instance  @xcite . in the multipolar coupling scheme and within the so - called electric - dipole approximation one",
    "has that the hamiltonian which describes the interaction between the atoms and the field is given by h_i ( ) & = & - _ 1(_1 ( ) ) ( x_1(_1 ( ) ) ) + & - & _ 2(_2 ( ) ) ( x_2(_2 ( ) ) ) [ hi ] where @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is the electric dipole moment operator for the @xmath17-th atom .",
    "it should be observed that the electric field above is the measured electric field defined through the measured force it exerts on an atom .",
    "the appearence of terms as @xmath35 is a consequence of the fact that both atoms move along different stationary trajectories as discussed above .",
    "as asserted in this paper we describe time evolutions with a coordinate time parameter which is to be identified with the rindler coordiante time @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , we are assuming that for both atoms each component of the dipole moment is required to evolve in time in the same way as de witt s monopole in the case of a scalar field , as discussed by takagi  @xcite .",
    "this would be the case only if the directions of the both dipole moments are kept fixed with respect to the proper frame of reference of the atoms ; otherwise the rotation of the dipole moment will bring in extra time dependence in addition to its intrinsic time evolution .",
    "in addition , one should bear in mind that , for each atom @xmath36 , where @xmath37 stands for the @xmath37-th spatial component with respect to the proper reference frame of the atom , which is the rindler orthonormal frame of reference .",
    "the expression for the atom - field interaction can always be put in a manifestly invariant form , that is , for each atom : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the four - velocity of the atom and @xmath40 is the four - vector associated with the dipole moment such that , in its proper reference frame , its temporal component vanishes and its spatial components are given by @xmath41 .",
    "we point out that the dipole moment operator can be written as _",
    "i(_i ) & = & g_i |_i| e_i | g_i e_i| + + & & , [ dip ] ( no summation over repeated indices ) where we have assumed a proper choice of phases which allows the dipole matrix elements to be real and we have defined the dipole raising and lowering operators as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . in addition , since the atoms are presumed to be identical , the matrix elements @xmath44 are independent of the index @xmath17 and denoted simply by @xmath45 .",
    "the heisenberg equations of motion for the dynamical variables of the atom and the field can be derived from the total hamiltonian @xmath46 .",
    "we draw attention to the fact that the present work employs a coherent quantum evolution treatment instead of the more tradicional open quantum system approach in the analysis of quantum entanglement .",
    "as remarked in the previous section , the former allows one to discuss the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction in the radiative processes of entangled atoms .",
    "the rates of change of the atomic observables are governed by the heisenberg equations & = & - i [ _ 1(_1())(x_1(_1())),s_a^z(_a ( ) ) ] + & - & i[_2(_2())(x_2(_2())),s_a^z(_a ( ) ) ] , + [ bad1 ] @xmath21 , whereas for dynamical variables of the field one has a_*k*,(t ( ) ) & & = -i_*k*a_*k*,(t ( ) ) + & & - i[_1(_1)(x_1(_1)),a_*k*,(t ( ) ) ] + & & - i[_2(_2)(x_2(_2)),a_*k*,(t ( ) ) ] . + [ bad2 ] in eq .",
    "( [ bad2 ] ) , @xmath47 and the proper times @xmath48 must be considered as functions of @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , in eq .",
    "( [ bad1 ] ) one have taken into account that @xmath49 commutes with @xmath27 . in order to proceed one splits the solutions of the equations of motion in two parts , namely : the free part , which is present even in the absence of the coupling ; and the source part , which is caused by the interaction between atom and field and contains the coupling constant @xmath50",
    ". therefore one can write  @xcite s_a^z(_a ( ) ) & = & s_a^z , f(_a ( ) ) + s_a^z , s(_a ( ) ) , + a_*k*,(t ( ) ) & = & a^f_*k*,(t ( ) ) + a^s_*k*,(t ( ) ) .",
    "similar considerations can be applied for the the electric dipole moment operators of the atoms , namely : @xmath51 . in this way , up to first order in @xmath52 , the solutions of the equations of motion are given by :    s_a^z , f(_a ( ) ) & = & s_a^z , f(_a(_0 ) ) + s_a^z , s(_a ( ) ) & = & - i _ b = 1 ^ 2__0^d [ ^f_b(_b( ) ) ^f(x_b(_b())),s_a^z , f(_a ( ) ) ] + a^f_*k*,(t ( ) ) & = & a^f_*k*,(t(_0))e^-i_*k * [ t ( ) - t(_0 ) ] + a^s_*k*,(t ( ) ) & = & -i_b = 1 ^ 2__0^d[^f_b(_b( ) ) ^f(x_b(_b())),a^f_*k*,(t ( ) ) ] .",
    "since one can construct from the annihilation and creation field operators the free and source part of the quantum electric field , one also has ( t(),*x * ( ) ) = * e*^f(t(),*x * ( ) ) + * e*^s(t(),*x * ( ) ) .",
    "however , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , there is an ambiguity of operator ordering which arises in such a procedure .",
    "being more specific , when one considers the heisenberg equations of motion for an arbitrary atomic observable @xmath53 = [ a ( ) , h_a ( ) ] + [ a ( ) , h_i ( ) ] and proceeds with the split of the solutions for the quantum field into free and source parts .",
    "the feature that all atomic observables commute with @xmath54 is preserved in time because of the unitary evolution . however , this is no longer true for @xmath55 and @xmath56 separately : the source part of the field picks up contributions of atomic observables during its time evolution . in face of this fact , one must choose an operator ordering when discussing the effects of @xmath55 and @xmath56 separately . this operation does not modify the final results for physical quantities , yet it does produce distinct interpretations concerning the roles played by vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction .",
    "nonetheless , there exists a preferred operator ordering by which the effects of such phenomena can posses independent physical meanings  @xcite .",
    "in other words , such works reveal that only if a symmetric ordering of atomic and field variables is adopted , both contributions coming from vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction are hermitian .",
    "therefore , adopting the symmetric ordering prescription , one can identify the contribution of the vacuum fluctuations to the above rate :    ( ) _ vf & = & - _",
    "a=1 ^ 2 \\{*e*^f(x_a(_a()))+ [ _ a(_a()),a()]^f(x_a(_a ( ) ) ) } , [ vf ] where the subscript @xmath57 stands for the vacuum - fluctuation contribution , and the radiation reaction terms read ( ) _ rr & = & - _",
    "a=1 ^ 2 \\{*e*^s(x_a(_a()))+ [ _ a(_a()),a()]^s(x_a(_a ( ) ) ) } , [ rr ] with the subscript @xmath58 labeling the radiation - reaction effect terms . in the expressions",
    "above we have considered only the part due to the interactions with the field .",
    "this method is the most interesting instruction which allows the possibility of studying the interplay between vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction in quantum entanglement .",
    "hence one can identify the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction in the evolution of the atoms energies , which are given by the expectation value of @xmath27 , given by equation  ( [ ha ] ) .",
    "the free part of the atomic hamiltonian is constant in time so that the rate of change of @xmath27 consists only of the two contributions given by , respectively ( ) _ vf & = & - _",
    "a=1 ^ 2 \\{*e*^f(x_a(_a()))+ [ _ a(_a()),h_a()]^f(x_a(_a ( ) ) ) } , [ vfha ] and ( ) _ rr & = & - _",
    "a=1 ^ 2 \\{*e*^s(x_a(_a()))+ [ _ a(_a()),h_a()]^s(x_a(_a()))}. [ rrha ] in a perturbative treatment , we take into account only terms up to order @xmath59 .",
    "we also consider an averaging over the field degrees of freedom by taking vacuum expectation values .",
    "since they contain only free operators , only the electric field is affected . in turn",
    ", we are interested in the evolution of expectation values of atomic observables .",
    "accordingly , we also take the expectation value of the above expressions in a state @xmath60 with energy @xmath61 , which can be one of the states given by equation  ( [ sta ] ) or one can also consider the bell states @xmath62 .",
    "more details concerning such calculations can be found elsewhere , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "therefore , with the notation @xmath63 , one has the pivotal results concerning the vacuum - fluctuation contribution _ vf = _ _ 0^d _ a , b = 1 ^ 2d_ij(x_a(_a()),x_b(_b()))^ij_ab(_a(),_b( ) ) , [ vfha3 ] where ^ij_ab(_a(),_b( ) ) = | [ ^i , f_a(_a()),^j , f_b(_b())]| , a , b = 1,2 , [ susa ] is the linear susceptibility of the two - atom system in the state @xmath60 and @xmath64 is the hadamard s elementary function .",
    "since we are dealing with free fields , one can employ the results derived in the appendix  [ a ] . on the other hand , for the radiation - reaction contribution",

    "therefore the vector character of the electric field is manifest in the appearance of indices in the correlation functions .",
    "note that @xmath67 and @xmath68 characterize only the two - atom system itself , unlike the statistical functions of the field which have to be evaluated along the trajectory of the atoms .",
    "we see from equations  ( [ vfha3 ] ) and  ( [ rrha3 ] ) that the rate of variation of the energy of the two - atom system presents contributions from the isolated atoms and also contributions due to cross correlations between the atoms mediated by the field .",
    "this interference is a consequence of the interaction of each atom with the field .",
    "such observations make clear that such a formalism enables one to discuss the generation of entanglement between atoms initially prepared , say , in the ground state as well as the stability of entangled states .    using that @xmath69 @xmath21 , and the completeness relation for the atomic product states ( or the bell states ) :",
    "@xmath70 one can show that the statistical functions for the two - atom system can be put in the following explicit forms ^ij_ab(, ) & = & _  , [ susa1 ] and d^ij_ab(, ) & = & _  , [ cora1 ] where @xmath71 , @xmath72 being the energy associated with the state @xmath73 .",

    "we wish to investigate the creation of entangled states [ currently represented by the bell states  ( [ bell ] ) ] from atoms initially prepared in a separable state [ given by equation  ( [ sta ] ) ] , and also the decay of the bell states to one of the product states . in order to study the degradation of entanglement between the atoms as a spontaneous emission phenomenon ,",

    "let us investigate the behavior of each of the contributions to @xmath123 as functions of the parameter @xmath7 .",

    "we see from such a plot that for high values of @xmath7 ( i.e. , high proper accelerations ) the differences between vacuum - fluctuation and radiation - reaction contributions become increasingly clear .",
    "the consequence of these considerations is that in principle one could plainly distinguish the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction for the formation of entangled atoms only for highly accelerated atoms .",
    "incidentally we call attention for the fact that for the transition @xmath124 , the case with equal proper accelerations offers an interesting result : for both contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction the cross correlations cancel the terms associated with isolated atoms .",

    "thus we recover a very known result in a complete different scenario , namely that atoms confined into a region much smaller than the optical wavelength , the antisymmetric bell state @xmath100 can be regarded as a decoherence - free state  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the results presented here should be compared with the outcomes of ref .",
    "@xcite , even though they are working with a scalar field . in this case",
    "in which both atoms have the same proper acceleration we expect to find similar qualitative conclusions as those of such a reference .",
    "there have been many works investigating quantum information theory within the framework of quantum field theory and quantum field theory in curved space - time .",
    "several of such studies were implemented in a framework of open quantum systems . following the discussion by dalibard , dupont - roc , and cohen - tannoudji , we proposed to analyze the distinct contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the quantum entanglement between two identical atoms in uniformly accelerated motion .",
    "we assume that both atoms are coupled to a quantum electromagnetic field .",
    "we have shown that the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the rate of variation of atomic anergy substantially differ for highly accelerated atoms .",
    "in addition , the creation of entanglement is possible for atoms initially prepared in the ground state .",
    "it is possible to envisage our results as the situation of two atoms coupled individually to two spatially separated cavities at different temperatures . for equal accelerations , we have found that the antisymmetric bell state @xmath100 acts as a decoherence - free state    a natural extension of this paper is to consider the same setup studied here in the presence of boundaries .",
    "since the presence of boundaries affect the vacuum fluctuations of the quantum field one should expect that the transition rates of atoms are modified in this situation .",
    "hence , for entangled states , which have a non - local nature , it is interesting to ask how the transition rates are modified in a situation where translational invariance is broken . in turn , a related scenario is the investigation of uniformly accelerated qubits interacting with a massless scalar field via monopole interaction .",
    "similar to the case studied here , we expect the radiation - reaction terms to possess some acceleration dependence as well as the appearance of non thermal contributions ( which also depend on the acceleration ) to the vacuum fluctuations of the field . however , we suspect that the emergence of such terms are connected solely with the presence of cross correlations between the atoms mediated by the scalar field , in contrast with the situation with the electromagnetic field .",
    "another possible direction is to consider a black - hole space - time .",
    "one may argue that , close to event horizon the schwarzschild metric takes the form of the rindler line element .",
    "therefore , in a certain sense the results discussed here can be extended to schwarzschild black holes assuming that the atoms are close to the event horizon . in spite of this , the topic is more subtle than it would appear at first .",
    "although entanglement is degraded near a schwarzschild black hole as predicted in  @xcite , there are important discrepancies arising due to the difference between an event horizon in schwarzschild space - time and an acceleration horizon in rindler space - time .",

    "<S> our results resemble the situation in which two inertial atoms are coupled individually to two spatially separated cavities at different temperatures . in addition , for equal accelerations we obtain that one of the maximally entangled antisymmetric bell state is a decoherence - free state . </S>"
