    "the parker ( or the magnetic buoyancy ) instability arises in a stratified plasma , which is partially supported against gravity by a magnetic field .",
    "it was originally proposed by parker that the magnetic buoyancy resulting in this system is a mechanism for the formation of sunspots @xcite . since",
    "then the theory of the magnetic buoyancy instability has been developed in numerous papers @xcite and extended to include various effects , such as pressure anisotropy @xcite , double diffusivity @xcite , rotation @xcite , microturbulence @xcite , line tying @xcite and nonuniform gravity @xcite .",
    "full 3-d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of the magnetic buoyancy instability have been performed in the solar context @xcite , including some that explore the effects of double diffusivity @xcite . at present time",
    "this instability is accepted in the astrophysical community as the driver of magnetic activity in objects ranging from stars to accretion disks and galaxies @xcite . in the sun ,",
    "the parker instability may even play a role in the global - scale magnetic dynamo @xcite .    despite its important role in understanding the dynamics of the astrophysical magnetic fields , no direct experimental investigation of the parker instability",
    "has been performed so far .",
    "the difficulty is in creating the proper conditions for this instability and , especially , in imitating relatively strong gravity in plasma .",
    "nonetheless , the parker instability could be realized in experiments with rapidly rotating plasmas , where the role of effective gravity is played by centrifugal acceleration .",
    "this possibility of exciting the parker instability was pointed out in theoretical studies devoted to centrifugally confined plasmas @xcite .",
    "however , the instability was not observed in the corresponding experiment .",
    "the reason lies , perhaps , in the profiles of magnetic field and rotation , which are optimized for plasma confinement and , therefore , for suppressing the instabilities .",
    "thus , the experimental observation of the parker instability is still lacking .    our present paper is motivated by the recent results from the madison plasma couette experiment ( mpcx ) showing a controllable plasma rotation @xcite . the mpcx has been specifically designed to study phenomena associated with plasma flows @xcite .",
    "a unique experimental setup is implemented in mpcx : a multicusp magnetic field localized near the walls of the cylindrical vessel provides plasma confinement and along with the applied electric field from the wall electrodes drives the prescribed azimuthal flows ( fig .",
    "[ mpcx ] ) .",
    "different types of flows potentially achievable in the mpcx can be used for investigation of such phenomena as magnetic dynamo @xcite and magnetorotational instability @xcite .",
    "drift by changing the voltages between electrodes .",
    "helmholtz coils ( hc ) are used to induce external ( mainly axial ) magnetic field .",
    "removable center core ( cc ) is shown , but it will not be used in the parker experiment .",
    "figure is adopted from ref .",
    "@xcite , title=\"fig : \" ] +    the goal of this theoretical study is to determine the plasma parameters , flows and magnetic fields required for excitation of the parker instability in a cylindrical geometry and to demonstrate the possibility of obtaining such instability in the mpcx .",
    "consideration is performed in the frame - work of isothermal compressible magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , which appears to be a good approximation for the mpcx plasma .",
    "the numerical results reported in the paper are obtained using the extended mhd code nimrod @xcite , which can accurately model both linear and nonlinear plasma dynamics in a specific geometry for realistic experimental conditions .",
    "the nimrod code has been used previously to study dynamo action @xcite and magnetorotational instability @xcite in mpcx .    in the paper",
    "we follow the convention of ref .",
    "@xcite and use the term  parker instability \" to denote an _ undular mode _ of magnetic buoyancy instability , in which the wave vector has a component parallel to the magnetic field and , therefore , the perturbed magnetic field lines are bent .",
    "this mode is opposed to an _ interchange mode _ , in which the wave vector is perpendicular to the magnetic field and perturbations do not bend the field lines .",
    "it turns out that in a plasma screw pinch with rigid - body rotation the stability boundaries are determined by the modes with non - zero parallel component of the wave vector .",
    "these field - bending modes are of primary interest in the paper .",
    "the detailed analysis of the parker instability was performed by newcomb @xcite .",
    "he considered a perfectly conducting plasma in a varying with height horizontal magnetic field and a uniform vertical gravitational field [ similar to configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ geom](a ) for @xmath3 , with gravity acting in the positive @xmath4 direction @xmath5 , and magnetic field having the only component @xmath6 .",
    "the equilibrium force balance is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the plasma pressure and @xmath9 is the plasma density .",
    "according to newcomb , the system is unstable with respect to the parker instability if for some perturbation @xmath10 the energy integral is negative , @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the adiabatic index , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are components of the wave vector of the perturbation .",
    "the first two terms in the integral are always positive and represent the stabilizing effect of magnetic field lines bending .",
    "the instability can arise only when the third term is negative . in an isothermal plasma with adiabatic index @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the average sound speed , eq .",
    "( [ new_stab ] ) is reduced to @xmath18 which means that the magnetic pressure must increase in the direction of gravity for the system to be unstable .",
    "a simple physical interpretation of this is given by acheson @xcite .",
    "in equilibrium , the magnetic pressure supports more mass against gravity than it would be possible in its absence .",
    "this extra mass , expressed in the form of magnetic pressure , enters the destabilizing third term in eq .",
    "( [ new_stab2 ] ) .",
    "the situation is somewhat analogous to the rayleigh - taylor instability , in which the heavy fluid lies on top of a lighter one @xcite .    as seen from eq .",
    "( [ new_stab2 ] ) , two key elements are necessary for driving the magnetic buoyancy instability in plasma : gravity and magnetic field .",
    "below we outline some specific conditions , which these elements should satisfy in the experiment .",
    "1 .   _ gravity ( rotation)_. centrifugal acceleration arising in a rotating plasma is the efficient way to mimic gravity in the experiment .",
    "obvious disadvantages of such an approach are the possible excitation of unwanted instabilities related to the rotation profile , such as rayleigh instability , kelvin - helmholtz instability , magnetorotational instability ( mri ) .",
    "a further consequence of rotation is that we might expect the coriolis force to stabilize some motions .",
    "if we assume that the rotation is uniform in the axial direction , then the most limiting condition on radial profile of angular velocity @xmath19 comes from the mri : to have a stable rotation in the presence of axial magnetic field one needs to satisfy @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we consider here only a case of rigid - body rotation with @xmath21 corresponding to effective centrifugal gravity @xmath22 .",
    "such plasma rotation has been successfully obtained in recent mpcx runs @xcite .",
    "magnetic field_. only internal ( i.e. , induced by currents flowing in plasma ) magnetic fields can be potentially buoyant .",
    "this is because magnetic fields contribute to the plasma force balance only if the corresponding lorentz force is not zero . evidently , externally applied fields do not have this property , so they alone can not induce parker instability .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of the field ( magnetic pressure ) has to be increasing in the direction of gravity .",
    "one of the feasible ways to create such magnetic field in the mpcx is to drive axial current through the plasma , so that azimuthal field is induced .",
    "however , the curvature of a purely azimuthal magnetic field makes plasma susceptible to the so - called  sausage \" instability ( with azimuthal mode number @xmath23 ) @xcite . this is obviously unwanted for the parker instability experiment , as this instability may mask the buoyancy instability . to avoid this complication , one can add an external axial magnetic field ( by driving current in the helmholtz coils , see fig .",
    "[ mpcx ] ) ; this leads to a screw pinch with a helical magnetic field .",
    "such magnetic field is also unstable to parasitic kink instabilities @xcite , but as we will show , the regions of plasma parameters corresponding to the kink modes and the parker instability are well separated , and these two instabilities can be easily distinguished in the experiment . in the following",
    "we consider only a case with uniform axial current density ( which is consistent with assumptions of uniform resistivity profile in isothermal plasma ) and uniform axial magnetic field , so the radial profiles of field components are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constant and @xmath28 is the radius of the pinch ( fig .",
    "[ geom ] ) .",
    "thus , the main object of our study is the plasma screw pinch with constant pitch and rigid - body rotation .",
    "we note here that unfavorable curvature of the helical field resulting from cylindrical geometry of the screw pinch can lead to development of unwanted kink instabilities . to tell whether the instability is due to kink modes or magnetic buoyancy",
    ", we also perform the stability analysis of analogous plasma configuration in a slab geometry , where the effects associated with the field curvature are absent and only magnetic buoyancy can play a role .",
    "then we compare and contrast the results obtained in the two geometries .",

    "we explore the nonlinear dynamics of the parker instability as well . in sec .",

    "we consider the stability problem for two equivalent plasma configurations in two different geometries  slab and cylinder ( fig .",
    "[ geom ] ) .",
    "this is done to distinguish the parker instability in the cylinder from kink instabilities related to the field curvature , as in our slab geometry there is no curvature in the imposed magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding equilibrium fields and gravity are given by @xmath29 note that the gravity in slab geometry is chosen in such way to be analogous to the centrifugal acceleration in cylinder .",
