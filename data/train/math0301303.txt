    "these are precisely the bounds of stanley ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this article is to show that the same bounds remain valid even if we do not assume the centrally symmetric polytope to be rational .",

    "brasselet , k.  fieseler and l.  kaup ( see @xcite ) and independently by p.  bressler and lunts ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the hard lefschetz theorem in this context was recently proved by kalle karu ( see @xcite ) . the fact that a combinatorial hard lefschetz theorem holds has striking consequences .",

    "then the polytope @xmath1 defines a complete fan in @xmath18 consisting of the cones through its proper faces : @xmath19 moreover , this fan is equipped with a _ strictly concave support function _ , that means a concave function whose restriction to any cone in @xmath20 is linear and such that for any two different maximal cones the linear functions obtained by restriction are different . to define this function ,",
