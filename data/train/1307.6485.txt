    "in classical geometry and physics , the geometry of a homogeneous space and its isometry group mutually determine each other .",
    "any deformation of either the geometry into a non - commutative version or of the isometry group into a hopf algebra should preserve as much of this interplay as possible .",
    "one way of achieving this , at least at the algebraic level , is to combine the space and its isometry into one algebraic object . in physics terms",
    ", such an algebra should combine position coordinates for space with generators of rotations and translations , i.e. , with angular momenta and momenta .",
    "momenta and positions are in duality and rotations act on both .",
    "this is manifest in three important subalgebras : the heisenberg algebra generated by positions and momenta , the isometry algebra generated by angular momenta and momenta and finally the algebra of angular momenta and positions , which one may interpret as an isometry algebra of momentum space . in these general terms",
    ", semiduality is a bijection between the isometry algebras of space and momentum space .",
    "a mathematically precise version of these ideas was formulated by majid in terms of hopf algebras @xcite or , infinitesimally , lie bialgebras @xcite , and is summarised in the textbook @xcite .",
    "majid s approach is in turn inspired by born s proposal of a reciprocity between momenta and positions @xcite . here",
    "we will use majid s framework , working at the level of lie bialgebras .",
    "thus , non - commutativity of a space is parametrised by lie brackets of position coordinates and its curvature by their co - commutator . in the dual lie bialgebra , commutators and co",
    "- commutators are swapped so that curvature of space is also captured in the commutators of momenta ; similarly curvature of momentum space is captured in the co - commutators of momenta or the commutators of positions .",
    "curved , homogenous geometries and the associated lie brackets of isometry algebras are a standard topic in classical geometry and physics .",
    "curved , homogeneous momentum spaces and the associated co - commutators of momenta are less familiar but play a central role in 3d ( quantum ) gravity ( see @xcite for a review ) , in so - called @xmath1-deformations of the poincar lie algebra @xcite and more recently in the discussion about relative locality @xcite . in this paper",
    "we exploit our familiarity with curvature and non - commutativity on one hand to enhance our understanding of co - commutativity on the other .",
    "we consider a family of lie algebras , thinking of them as rotation - position algebras or infinitesimal isometries of momentum space , and systematically compute their semidual bialgebras .",
    "the semiduals have non - trivial co - commutators which are co - boundary , i.e. , given by a classical @xmath0-matrix .",
    "we derive a formula for the @xmath0-matrix in terms of the map which characterises the split of the original lie algebra into rotation generators and positions .",
    "specialising to three dimensions , the semiduals of our family of lie bialgebras have the lie brackets of the 3d euclidean or poincar groups .",
    "lie bialgebra structures on these lie algebras are necessarily co - boundary and the possible @xmath0-matrices were classified a while ago by stachura in @xcite .",
    "denoting angular momenta by @xmath2 and momenta by @xmath3 , the list found by stachura includes @xmath0-matrices which only contain rotation or lorentz generators ( these are just the standard @xmath0-matrices for @xmath4 ) , trivial solutions which only contain the commuting momentum generators , and then a more interesting and complicated list of solutions of the mixed form @xmath5 .",
    "our approach via semiduality reproduces all these mixed solutions and relates them to the lie brackets of the original algebra .",
    "in particular , we are able to relate these @xmath0-matrices to the bianchi classification of three - dimensional lie algebras .",
    "the work reported here is closely related to our previous paper @xcite in which we studied the semidual hopf algebras of the universal enveloping algebras of the isometry lie algebras arising in 3d gravity .",
    "here we generalise and extend the results of @xcite at the infinitesimal , lie bialgebra level",
    ". however , in comparing the current paper with @xcite and also with previous work on semiduality in 3d quantum gravity @xcite the reader should be aware of a possible confusion between different interpretations of semiduality .",
    "here we interpret semiduality essentially as the exchange of position and momentum generators , as outlined above . in @xcite , by contrast , pairs of semidual hopf algebras are both thought of as ` rotation - momentum ' algebras , but semiduality exchanges the regimes of 3d quantum gravity where they play the role of quantum isometry groups .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we introduce the family of lie algebras whose direct sum decomposition we would like to study .",
    "they are necessarily even - dimensional and obtained from a given real lie algebra @xmath6 by a process of generalised complexification .",
    "we parametrise decompositions of lie algebras in the original family as double cross sums with @xmath6 as one of the factors in terms of a map @xmath7 and derive a quadratic lie - algebraic relation for @xmath8 which ensures that it does indeed define a double cross sum .",
    "the main result of this section is that such maps also characterise classical @xmath0-matrices of the semidual lie bi - algebra , and that the quadratic relation obtained as factorisation condition is equivalent to the modified classical yang - baxter equation for the semidual lie bi - algebra . in sect .",
    "3 we specialise to the case where @xmath6 is the lie algebra of either the rotation group in euclidean 3-space or the lorentz group in three spacetime dimensions .",
    "the resulting family of complexified lie algebras are the local isometry groups of 3d gravity @xcite , but here we think of them as the lie algebras of rotations or lorentz boosts together with position coordinates , so that , in keeping with the general philosophy explained above , their semiduals , which have the lie algebra structure of the 3d euclidean or poincar lie algebra , can be interpreted as spacetime symmetries . using the isomorphism between @xmath9 and @xmath6 in this case , we reformulate the quadratic lie - algebraic relation for @xmath8 as a quadratic equation for the linear map @xmath8 , and , using rotational or lorentz symmetry , project out three equations which have to be satisfied independently . solving these equations in sect .",
    "4 we recover a family of @xmath0-matrices for the euclidean and poincar lie algebras first found by stachura @xcite , and show that they are in one - to - one correspondence with the types in the bianchi classification of three - dimensional lie algebras bar the heisenberg algebra .",
    "5 contains a summary of our results in tabular form and a discussion .",
    "consider an _ _ arbitrary @xmath10-dimensional real lie algebra @xmath6 with generators @xmath11 and brackets = f_ab^cj_c . here and in the following we use the einstein summation convention .",
    "picking a real number @xmath12 , one can associate to this lie algebra the following @xmath13-dimensional real lie algebra @xmath14 with generators @xmath15 , additional generators @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and brackets of the cartan form [ genisolie ] [ j_a , j_b]=f_ab^cj_c , = f_ab^c_c , = f_ab^cj_c . for @xmath18 this is the usual complexification @xmath19 , for @xmath20 it is the semidirect product @xmath21 and for @xmath22 it is isomorphic to @xmath23 .",
    "one can unify these three cases by considering the lie algebra @xmath14 as a generalised complexification with a formal parameter @xmath24 which satisfies @xmath25 and the identification @xmath26 , see @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we also think of the @xmath2 as generalisations of rotation or lorentz generators .",
    "however , when we apply semiduality we switch from the generators @xmath16 to generators of the dual vector space , which we then interpret as momentum space . from that point of view",
    ", the generators @xmath16 should be thought of as position coordinates , and @xmath12 as a real constant related to the curvature of momentum space @xcite    we are interested in all decompositions of @xmath14 as double cross sum @xmath28 of @xmath6 and a second @xmath10-dimensional lie algebra @xmath29 .",

    "we show the following .",
    "the condition on @xmath39 for the generators to form a lie subalgebra of @xmath14 is [ mcond ] [ ( x),(y)]-([x,(y)]+[(x),y ] ) = - x , y .    * proof * in terms of the map we need to find the condition under which the commutator of the two elements of the form @xmath40 and @xmath41 lies in the image of @xmath42 .",

    "we are going to apply it to the lie bialgebras @xmath46 , with the lie algebra structure already discussed and trivial co - commutator . in the semidual lie bialgebra ,",
    "the lie algebra @xmath30 is replaced by its dual lie bialgebra @xmath47 . in our case , @xmath30 has trivial co - commutators so that the lie algebra structure of @xmath47 is abelian .",

    "then , in terms of the generators @xmath51 of the semidual lie bialgebra , the commutators are [ semid ] [ j_a , j_b]=f_ab^cj_c , = -f_ac^b^c , = 0 , or @xmath52=f_{ab}^{\\;\\;\\;c}j_c , \\quad [ \\cp^a , j_b]=f_{bc}^{\\;\\;\\;a}\\cp^c , \\quad [ \\cp^a,\\cp^b]=0.\\ ] ] applying the general formulae in sect .  8.3 of @xcite ,",
