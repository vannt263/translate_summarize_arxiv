    "the precise determination of the element @xmath3 of the ckm matrix is an important test of the flavour structure of the standard model ( sm ) and is crucial in the indirect search for new physics .",
    "the latest global fit to the unitarity triangle ( ut ) including all flavour changing observables but a direct determination of @xmath3 predicts @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this value agrees within errors with the _ exclusive _ determination , that relies on lattice qcd or light - cone sum rules @xcite and that is still affected by somewhat large theoretical errors . an _ inclusive _ analysis is in principle the cleanest method to precisely determine @xmath3 .",
    "this is based on the comparison between the decay rate of @xmath0 measured by experiments and the corresponding theoretical prediction .",
    "the latest hfag world average @xcite yields an inclusive @xmath3 which is about @xmath5 higher than the value preferred by the global ut fit , calling for a deeper investigation of the process .",
    "the theoretical description of @xmath0 is based on a local operator product expansion .",
    "inclusive quantities are organized in a double series in @xmath6 ( perturbative qcd corrections ) and in @xmath7 ( heavy quark expansion ) .",
    "the very same method was successfully applied to the @xmath8 decay and led to a precise determination of @xmath9 , within 2% .",
    "the description of charmless decays is more involved due to the dominant charmed background that needs to be rejected by experiments imposing very stringent cuts .",
    "these cuts can spoil the convergence of the ope introducing sensitivity to nonlocal effects , such as the motion of the @xmath10 quark inside the meson ( fermi motion ) , that can be parameterized in terms of a light - cone distribution function ( or `` shape function '' ) .",
    "the lowest integer moments of the distribution function are constrained by the ope @xcite and they are expressed in terms of the @xmath10 quark mass and of the same 5 and 6 dimensional operators that contribute to @xmath11 .",
    "such expressions are universal , i.e. independent of the process , and shared by the radiative decay @xmath12 only as long as @xmath7 corrections are neglected .",
    "an ope - based treatment of shape function effects in @xmath12 including subleading ( @xmath7 ) effects was developed in @xcite and turned out to describe well experimental data . in @xcite",
    "a similar procedure was undertaken for the case of semileptonic decays , where many complications arise , mostly due to the kinematics taking place at different @xmath2 . in the following",
    "we illustrate the main features of this procedure and show some meaningful results .",
    "all observables describing the @xmath0 decay can be extracted _ via _ integration over the triple differential width : @xmath13 w_2 \\nonumber   +   { q^2}(2{e_\\ell}-{q_0 } ) w_3 \\bigr\\}\\times \\\\ & & \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad     \\times \\theta \\left({q_0}-{e_\\ell}-\\frac{{q^2}}{4{e_\\ell } }",
    "\\right )    \\ \\theta({e_\\ell } ) \\ \\theta({q^2 } ) \\ \\theta({q_0}-\\sqrt{{q^2}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the total leptonic and the charged lepton energies in the @xmath16 meson rest frame , @xmath2 is the leptonic invariant mass and @xmath17 are the three structure functions relevant in the case of massless lepton .",
    "perturbative corrections to the structure functions @xmath17 to order @xmath18 have been known for quite long @xcite , whereas @xmath19 corrections recently appeared in @xcite .",
    "both calculations were performed in the _ on - shell _ scheme .",
    "it has been stressed several times in the literature @xcite that an _ on - shell _ definition of the @xmath10 quark mass becomes ambiguous as soon as power suppressed terms are included .",
    "the _ pole _ mass is better traded with a _ running _ mass @xmath20 . to this purpose ,",
    "perturbative corrections to order @xmath19 are calculated anew in @xcite in the presence of a `` hard '' wilsonian cutoff @xmath1 gev .",
    "this new scale separates the perturbative regime of gluons with energies larger than @xmath21 from the `` soft '' ( non - perturbative ) regime of gluons with energies lower than @xmath21 .",
    "the contributions of soft gluons are then absorbed into a redefinition of the heavy quark parameters , consistent with the way they are extracted from fits to @xmath11 moments in the _ kinetic _ scheme @xcite .",
    "physical observables are of course independent of the cutoff .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , fermi motion is encoded in a distribution function , whose lowest integer moments are constrained by the local ope .",
    "as soon as @xmath7 corrections are retained , such moments cease to be universal : they have different expressions for each of the three structure functions in eq . and show an explicit @xmath2 dependence . to preserve generality",
    "we introduce three separate distribution functions , one for each of the structure functions , depending on the light - cone component of the @xmath10 quark momentum ( @xmath22 ) , on @xmath2 and on the wilsonian cutoff ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "hadronic structure functions are then defined _ via _ a convolution of the perturbative structure functions with the distribution functions , whose expression is derived at the leading order in @xmath7 and @xmath6 and assumed to be valid also at higher orders : @xmath23\\ ] ] model - dependence resides only in the _ ansatz _ employed for the distribution functions . in the analysis of @xcite a set of about 80 different functional forms , inspired by those already present in the literature ( exponential , gaussian , roman , hyperbolic ) , is tested and the related uncertainty on @xmath3 turns out to be rather small ( see sec . [ results ] ) .",
    "the impact of fermi motion becomes irrelevant at high @xmath2 and the developed formalism is no more applicable .",
    "the ope itself shows a number of pathological features in this kinematical region , due to the emergence of unsuppressed higher order terms .",
    "for instance , the ope predicts a value for the variance of the distribution functions which decreases at increasing @xmath2 , reaching even negative values .",
    "moreover , wilson coefficients of power suppressed operators become more and more important and already the coefficient of the darwin term ( @xmath24 ) shows a divergence at @xmath25 : ~+ ... , ^2= [ q2ope ] this singularity is removed at the level of the total rate by a one - loop penguin diagram that mixes the weak annihilation ( wa ) four - quark operator into the darwin operator @xcite . however , as we are interested in differential distributions as well , a dedicated treatment of the high-@xmath2 region ( @xmath26 ) is mandatory . in @xcite two different methods",
    "are proposed and their difference is used to estimate the associated uncertainty :    * we model the tail in a way consistent with positivity of the spectra and including a wa contribution ( @xmath27 ) through a dirac-@xmath28 localized at the endpoint ( default method ) : ~+ x ( 1-^2)+ ... [ q2mod ] * we extend the fermi motion description of low @xmath2 to the high @xmath2 region , _ freezing _ the shape function at @xmath29 and using it in the convolution of eq . at higher @xmath2 .",
    "we take advantage of some of the latest experimental measurements to extract values of @xmath3 using the descripted framework .",
    "we leave the task of an average of these results to a future , hopefully dedicated , experimental analysis .",
    "we consider :    * belle analysis with @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite ; * belle and babar analyses with @xmath30 , @xmath32 , and @xmath31 @xcite ; * babar analysis with @xmath33 @xcite    results are summarized in table 1 and were obtained from a c++ code available upon request .",
    "the reported values of @xmath3 are obtained using the default setting , namely an exponential _ ansatz _ for the distribution functions , the prescription _ a ) _ for the high @xmath2 tail at @xmath34 ( see previous section ) and the central values of the fit in @xcite as input parameters , at @xmath21 = 1 gev .",
    "@xmath35 is the estimated fraction of events , whereas the following columns show different sources of uncertainty , namely :    * experimental error ( exp ) .",
    "* parameteric error ( par ) : it is extracted taking into account all correlations between non - perturbative parameters @xcite and varying @xmath36 by @xmath37 as uncorrelated .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath38 is by far dominating .",
    "* perturbative error ( pert ) .",
    "* errors related to the high @xmath2 region : we consider the difference between methods _ a ) _ and _ b ) _ ( tail model ) , the value of @xmath2 at which the modelling sets in ( @xmath39 ) and the error due to wa effects ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we let @xmath27 vary in a range consistent with the 90% confidence level bound set by cleo on the size of wa @xcite , namely @xmath40 .",
    "we stress that the error related to @xmath27 is asymmetric and points to a lower value of @xmath3 . * functional form dependence ( ff ) , estimated using about 80 different _",
    "ans@xmath41tze _ for the distribution functions .",
    "it is worth stressing that all combinations of cuts considered include the high @xmath2 region discussed in the previous section which , as we showed , is plagued by poorly controlled effects . however , belle measurements * a * and * b * can be easily combined in order to obtain an estimate of @xmath3 with an _ upper _ cut on @xmath2 , namely for the combination @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath42 .",
    "this yields , within our framework , a value of @xmath3 much lower than in all other cases ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "and it might signal some bias in the treatment of the high @xmath2 region either on the experimental or on the theoretical side .",
    "only a dedicated experimental analysis with an upper cut on @xmath2 could probably shed some light on this issue .",
    "we presented a new approach for dealing with the triple differential width of @xmath44 decays , in a framework characterised by a hard wilsonian cutoff @xmath1 gev . the method developed takes into account all known perturbative and non - perturbative corrections .",
    "fermi motion is treated at the subleading level as well .",
    "some problems related to the high @xmath2 region of the process were pointed out , that were probably underestimated in the past and that still deserve a deeper investigation .",
    "we also presented some numerical results with the associated uncertainties and put forward the suggestion of a new experimental analysis with an upper cut on @xmath2 .",
