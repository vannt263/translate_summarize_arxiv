    "we discuss this aspect of the problem in sect .",

    "2010 ; krumholz & burkert 2010 ; puech 2010 ; genzel et al .",
    "this assumption makes sense because the mass fraction of molecular gas increases steeply with redshift ( e.g. , daddi et al .",
    "2010 ; tacconi et al .",
    "2010 ; carilli & walter 2013 ) , and because most of the stars in high - redshift discs were probably formed during the on - going starburst and did not have time to heat up significantly ( see again burkert et al .  2010 ; krumholz & burkert 2010 ; puech 2010 ; genzel et al .",
    "older generations of stars with @xmath32 could also exist ( glazebrook 2013 ) , but they would play a negligible role in the gravitational instability of the disc , even if @xmath33 , because the resulting @xmath34 stability parameter would still be dominated by the young gaseous - stellar component ( romeo & falstad 2013 ) .    as pointed out in sect .  1 , this simple model does not capture an important aspect of the problem : in clumpy discs , the mass - size and linewidth - size scaling relations of the clumps can have a strong impact on disc instability ( romeo et al .",
    "2010 ) . here",
    "we take such relations into account , and assume that molecular gas and young stars have similar scaling properties , so that the surface density and the velocity dispersion of the disc are scale - dependent and given by : @xmath35 @xmath36 this assumption makes sense because newborn stars inherit the scaling properties of the parent gas ( e.g. , larson 1979 ; snchez et al .",
    "note that , since eqs ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are power laws , the choice of @xmath37 is arbitrary .",
    "what really matters is not @xmath37 itself but the values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which unfortunately are poorly constrained .",
    "a physically meaningful choice would be to identify @xmath37 with the disc scale height , @xmath40 , which is the natural smoothing scale of galactic discs ( romeo 1994 ) .",
    "however , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are often measured at scales comparable to the disc scale length , @xmath41 ( e.g. , puech 2010 ) , or at intermediate scales ( e.g. , genzel et al .",
    "2014 ) . to make our analysis readily applicable",
    ", we choose to identify @xmath37 with the scale at which @xmath10 and @xmath11 are measured , and assume that this is also the scale at which the toomre parameter and the 2d jeans length are inferred : @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the 2d jeans wavenumber ( once again , choosing @xmath45 or @xmath46 is only conceptually different from our choice ; the results are identical ) .",
    "hereafter we will refer to @xmath37 as ` the spatial resolution ( scale ) ' , like leroy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and genzel et al .",
    "this scale should _ not _ be confused with the resolution limit of the observations : @xmath10 and @xmath11 are usually measured averaging over scales larger than the beam size .",
    "note also that @xmath37 can not have any influence on the actual stability properties of the disc .",
    "however , since @xmath37 affects the _ inferred _ values of @xmath34 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , it will also have a significant effect on the _ derived _ conditions for gravitational instability .",
    "as discussed above , clumpy discs at high redshift are dynamically similar to gas discs with scale - dependent surface density and velocity dispersion .",
    "the gravitational instability of such discs was explored by romeo et al .",

    "if the disc is subject to local axisymmetric perturbations , as is generally assumed , then its response is described by a dispersion relation that we now write as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the frequency and the wavenumber of the perturbation , and @xmath55 is the epicyclic frequency .",

    "the range @xmath58 corresponds to the case of 3d turbulence ( i.e.  to the usual clump scaling relations ) , whereas the range @xmath60 corresponds to the case of 2d turbulence ( i.e.  to a large - scale extrapolation of the clump scaling relations ; a more realistic case will be discussed in sect .",
    "note also that eq .",
    "( 9 ) is a relation between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which is affected by four parameters : @xmath64 ( the classical stability parameter ) , @xmath65 ( a parameter that couples gravitational instability with spatial resolution ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( the logarithmic slopes of the clump scaling relations ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath25 and @xmath26 have an important effect on the shape of the dispersion relation , and hence on the condition for gravitational instability ( @xmath66 ) .",

    "such regimes are illustrated in fig .  1",

    "* in _ regime c _ ,",
    "i.e.  for @xmath71 and @xmath68 , the stability of the disc is no longer controlled by @xmath64 : the disc is always unstable at small scales ( i.e.  as @xmath72 ) and stable at large scales ( i.e.  as @xmath73 ) . * in _ regime b _ , i.e.  for @xmath74 and @xmath68 , the disc is stable at all scales if and only if @xmath75 .",
    "this is a regime of transition between stability  la toomre ( regime a ) and instability at small scales ( regime c ) .",
    "thus even small variations in the scaling properties of the clumps can drive the disc into regime a or regime c , and have a strong impact on its gravitational instability .",
    "note that the stability criteria for regimes a and b are _ scale - invariant _ , i.e.  they only apparently depend on the spatial resolution scale @xmath37 : if the disc is stable at a given @xmath37 , then it will also be stable at any other spatial resolution .",
    "note also that similar instability regimes are found in the milky way and nearby galaxies , but at scales smaller than about 100 pc ( hoffmann & romeo 2012 ) .",
    "( 9 ) can be used not only for identifying the main instability regimes of clumpy discs , but also for predicting the size and mass ranges of unstable regions in such systems .",
    "these correspond to the range(s ) of @xmath20 where @xmath66 and to the associated range(s ) of @xmath76 ( numerical factors are irrelevant , since we are interested in mass ratios ) . here",
    "we focus on this aspect of the problem , and analyse the effects of varying the clump scaling relations across the ranges highlighted in fig .  1 .",
    "the idea behind our choices of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is to vary one parameter at a time , starting from @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( larson s scaling laws ) , and spanning the ranges of @xmath25 and @xmath26 observed in molecular clouds ( shaded ) .",
    "we vary @xmath26 down to @xmath77 so as to include the classical case of toomre instability .",
    "concerning the other parameters , we choose @xmath78 so as to sample the ( in)stability condition for discs governed by larson s scaling laws ( regime b ) , and @xmath79 so as to represent the state of violent gravitational instability observed in high - redshift star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , puech 2010 ; genzel et al .",

    "@xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( genzel , private communication ) .",
    "this yields @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the spatial resolution scale is @xmath86 , hence @xmath87 . ] before discussing the results of our analysis , let us make a final remark about our parameter choice . by fixing @xmath64 while changing @xmath65 , we are also implicitly changing @xmath88 and @xmath89 , albeit not according to a unique set of scaling relations ( otherwise @xmath64 would also change ) .",
    "doing so , we are probing _ different _ physical states or regions of the disc .",
    "our parameter choice is meant to illustrate a few interesting examples of disc stability properties relevant to high - redshift star - forming galaxies , as we discuss below .",
    "let us first discuss the effect of varying @xmath26 , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "we only show the size range of unstable regions ( shaded ) , since the associated mass range follows trivially from larson s third law ( @xmath90 ; remember that here @xmath21 ) .",
    "for @xmath77 , the classical case of toomre instability , the range of unstable scales can be easily computed since @xmath91 is a quadratic inequality .",
    "the largest and the smallest ( marginally ) unstable scales are then @xmath92 . within this range",
    ", there is a scale that corresponds to the fastest growing mode , and therefore plays a primary role in the classical instability scenario .",
    "this is ` the most unstable scale ' , which can be computed by minimizing @xmath93 : @xmath94 . for all other values of @xmath26 , the three scales introduced above depend on the coupling between gravitational instability and spatial resolution .",
    "when the 2d jeans length is not resolved , the disc is unstable over a broad range of @xmath20 for all values of @xmath26 ( see the left panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "the largest unstable scale decreases gradually with increasing @xmath26 , while the smallest and the most unstable scales decrease steeply as @xmath26 approaches 0.5 ( regime a ) and vanish thereafter ( regimes b and c ) .",
    "note , however , that scales @xmath95 can not be resolved , and scales @xmath96 are unphysical because they exceed the typical size of galaxies at @xmath80 . ) . ]",
    "this implies ( i ) that the observable size range of unstable regions is constant up to @xmath97 , and shrinks by a factor of 6 from @xmath97 to @xmath98 ; and ( ii ) that none of the ` characteristic ' unstable scales plays a significant role in toomre - like instabilities , when @xmath99 and @xmath79 .    when the 2d jeans length is resolved , the disc is no longer unstable for all values of @xmath26 ( see now the middle and right panels of fig .  2 )",
    ". there are two distinct instability domains , but only one of them is observable : the domain of toomre - like instabilities ( regime a ) .",
    "the higher the spatial resolution , the smaller this domain .",
    "note that there is a value of @xmath100 for which the disc is marginally unstable , like a classical disc with @xmath101 .",
    "in such a case , the instability range collapses into a single characteristic scale , which is of the order of the typical size of the clumps ( e.g. , noguchi 1998 , 1999 ; dekel et al .",
    "2009 ; genzel et al .",
    "when @xmath102 , marginal instability occurs for @xmath103 and the characteristic instability scale is about @xmath104 , i.e.  25% larger than in the classical case ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "when @xmath106 , the disc is marginally unstable for @xmath107 and the characteristic scale is about @xmath108 , which is comparable to the half - light radius of the galaxy .",
    "the effect of varying @xmath25 is illustrated in fig .",
    "a comparison between the top panels of this figure and fig .",
    "2 shows that increasing @xmath25 has a qualitatively similar effect to decreasing @xmath26 .",
    "this is basically because , as @xmath25 varies from @xmath1090.8 to 0.7 , the disc spans all the main instability regimes , starting from regime c and ending with regime a. despite this similarity , @xmath25 has a stronger impact on disc instability than @xmath26 . for example , when @xmath102 , the characteristic instability scale for a marginally unstable disc ( @xmath110 ) is about @xmath111 , i.e.  50% larger than in the classical case .",
    "and , when @xmath106 , such a scale exceeds the typical size of galaxies at @xmath80 .",
    "the bottom panels of fig .  3 show that @xmath25 has an even stronger impact on the mass range of unstable regions .",
    "this is because @xmath112 with @xmath113 , and because variations in @xmath19 are now boosted by the @xmath25-dependent factor @xmath114 .",
    "note also that the 2d jeans mass is defined consistent with the mass - size scaling relation , @xmath115 , and so are all other relevant masses .",
    "hence the lower and upper bounds of the observable range are themselves functions of @xmath25 for a given @xmath116 , as is shown in the bottom panels of fig .  3 .",
    "current dynamical models of high - redshift star - forming galaxies suggest that their discs are driven by self - regulation processes , which keep them close to marginal instability ( e.g. , noguchi 1998 , 1999 ; agertz et al .",

    "we analyse the case @xmath101 , which is classically associated with marginal instability .",

    "note also that the median value of the 2d jeans length in such discs is @xmath119 , and that the spatial resolution scale is @xmath86 , hence @xmath120 .",
    "this means that the 2d jeans length is far from being resolved , and so are the size and mass ranges of unstable regions for all observed values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this is consistent with the gravitational quenching found by genzel et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , but it also means that we need much higher resolution to probe gravitational instabilities in such discs .    what would we observe if the 2d jeans length were marginally resolved ( @xmath102 ) and the toomre parameter were still unity ?",

    "in such a case , the disc is marginally unstable for @xmath125 , the characteristic instability scale is @xmath126 , and the associated mass is @xmath127 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of romeo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who found that the stability criterion for regime a degenerates into toomre s stability criterion for all @xmath128 . as @xmath101 is a case of special interest ,",
    "let us also analyse specific values of @xmath51 : the cases illustrated in fig .  1 .    * _ case l _ , i.e.  @xmath129 , represents the original scaling relations found by arson ( 1981 ) . *",

    "as we move along this sequence of cases , @xmath26 remains approximately constant and close to 0.5 , while @xmath25 varies from @xmath1090.1 to 0.6 .",
    "this gives rise to significant differences in the stability properties of the disc , especially in its stability threshold ( @xmath70 ) and stability level ( @xmath135 ) , given that most of these cases fall within regime a. in fact , as we move from l to fs while keeping @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the disc changes from highly stable ( l and s ) to unstable ( fs ) . in this case , the instability range is @xmath136 , the most unstable scale is @xmath126 , and the ( in)stability threshold is @xmath137 .",
    "this reveals an important peculiarity of clumpy discs : they can be unstable across a wide range of scales and , at the same time , close to marginal instability !",
    "this is not a paradox .",
    "it follows from the fact that the dispersion relation of such discs can be very flat and/or asymmetric around its minimum .",
    "the mass - size and linewidth - size scaling relations considered so far are simple power laws , like those observed in molecular clouds but extrapolated to scales larger than the disc scale height ( see sect .",
    "there is indeed no direct measurement of those relations at such scales .",

    "it is highly non - trivial to translate observed power spectra into mass - size or linewidth - size scaling relations .",
    "the reason is twofold :    1 .",
    "both density and velocity fluctuations contribute to the intensity power spectrum ( lazarian & pogosyan 2000 ) ; 2 .",
    "even when density fluctuations dominate , there are distinct methods for estimating the fractal dimension , @xmath139 , which lead to significantly different values of @xmath140 ( federrath et al .  2009 ; federrath , private communication ) .",
    "snchez et al .  (",
    "2010 ) carried out a detailed fractal analysis of m33 , and showed that the distribution of molecular gas undergoes a transition from fractal to homogeneous at scales roughly comparable to the disc scale height .",
    "this suggests that @xmath141 for @xmath60 .",
    "concerning the value of @xmath26 , kim et al .",
    "( 2007 ) analysed the physical properties of atomic gas in the large magellanic cloud , and found that the linewidth - size scaling relation of hi clouds is a simple power law up to scales of a few kpc .",
    "bournaud et al .",
    "( 2010 ) analysed the gas velocity fields of simulated galaxies , and found that the power spectrum of @xmath142 has a break at @xmath138 , while the power spectra of @xmath143 and @xmath144 are simple power laws .",
    "since the velocity dispersion relevant to our stability analysis is the radial one , the results above suggest that @xmath145 up to scales @xmath146 .",
    "so what role does the disc scale height play in our stability scenario ? to answer this question , we consider the following mass - size and linewidth - size scaling relations : @xmath147 @xmath148 such values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 are motivated by the results discussed above , and by the detailed comparative analysis carried out by kritsuk et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for @xmath58 ( see sect .  2.3 ) .",
    "4 illustrates that a break in the mass - size scaling relation causes a transition in the stability properties of the disc .",
    "look for example at the middle panel , and see how the size range of unstable regions and the most unstable scale ` break ' at @xmath149 .",
    "such a transition exists for all values of @xmath150 , and should be observable if the disc scale height is spatially resolved .",
    "note also that the characteristic instability scale for marginally unstable discs ( @xmath151 ) is @xmath152 this means that the disc scale height is also the natural size of unstable clumps , and is comparable to the 2d jeans length ( for @xmath151 ) .",
    "is this an obvious result ?",
    "no , it is not ! in non - clumpy but realistically thick gas discs , the characteristic instability scale is @xmath153 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this is well beyond the ranges shown in fig .",
    "the results discussed above show that the disc scale height plays an important role in our stability scenario .",
    "this is a promising and novel avenue for constraining the size and mass of star - forming clumps in high - redshift galaxies , a topic that we will address further in future work .",
    "we have investigated the gravitational instability of clumpy disc galaxies , focusing on the size and mass ranges of unstable regions .",
    "multi - frequency observations of both the gas and the stellar contents ( e.g. , elmegreen & elmegreen 2006 ; shapiro et al .  2008 ; tacconi et al .",
    "2010 ) have established that such galaxies are ubiquitous at high redshift .",
    "furthermore , the majority of stars in the universe are known to form at @xmath154 ( e.g. , hopkins & beacom 2006 ) .",
    "thus it is crucial to understand the properties of unstable star - forming gas at this epoch of galaxy evolution .",
    "clumpy discs at high redshift are dynamically similar to gas discs with scale - dependent surface density and velocity dispersion , i.e.  @xmath155 and @xmath50 , where @xmath20 is the clump size .",
    "taking these ` turbulent ' scaling relations into account , and extending the traditional toomre stability analysis as in romeo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , a wide variety of non - classical stability properties arise .",
    "we have illustrated this scenario for the whole observed range spanned by the clump scaling relations , which is centred around larson s scaling laws @xmath156 , and for a range of spatial resolution scales typical of current high - redshift surveys . our key results and a few eloquent examples are summarized below .    1 .   the scale - dependence of the surface density and velocity dispersion plays a _",
    "crucial _ role in determining the size and mass ranges of unstable regions .",
    "for example , in the rings and outer discs of sins / zc - sinf galaxies at @xmath80 ( genzel et al .",
    "2014 ) , where the spatial resolution scale is close to the inferred 2d jeans length , small variations in the logarithmic slope of @xmath157 can lead to dramatic , order - of - magnitude , changes in the mass of the most unstable clumps .",
    "for the same observed surface density and velocity dispersion , logarithmic slopes of @xmath158 steeper than @xmath103 and flatter than @xmath97 ( @xmath21 ) lead to complete disc stability .",
    "this illustrates the dynamical complexity introduced by the clump scaling relations .",
    "2 .   variations in the logarithmic slopes of @xmath157 and @xmath158 can drive significant changes in the stability properties of the disc at _ all _ scales .",
    "for example , a clumpy disc can be marginally stable even if the classical toomre parameter @xmath117 . in the case of larson s scaling laws , the disc is always stable , however small @xmath64 is , if the inferred 2d jeans length @xmath159 is larger than the spatial resolution scale @xmath37 .",
    "3 .   for discs with @xmath101",
    ", we have payed special attention to @xmath97 and @xmath160 , since this range encompasses the most representative values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 found in observational ( e.g. , larson 1981 ; solomon et al .",
    "1987 ) and theoretical ( e.g. , federrath 2013 ; kritsuk et al .",
    "2013 ) works on supersonic turbulence . in spite of being marginally stable in the classical sense , such discs can be anywhere from highly stable to unstable , depending on the value of @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , as @xmath25 approaches 0.6 while @xmath161 , all observable scales @xmath136 become unstable , _ even though _ the disc is close to the stability threshold ( @xmath137 ) .    points ( i)(iii )",
    "illustrate the peculiar stability regimes possessed by discs with scale - dependent surface densities and velocity dispersions , and why it is important to take such regimes into account when predicting the size and mass of star - forming clumps in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "note also that our work raises an important caveat : as the interstellar medium ( ism ) is characterized by scale - dependent surface densities and velocity dispersions , we can not thoroughly understand its global stability properties unless we carry out _ multi - scale _ observations .",
    "this will soon be possible thanks to dedicated alma surveys , which will explore the physical properties of super - giant molecular clouds at the peak of cosmic star formation and beyond .",
    "our work provides a new set of tools for exploring galactic star formation . in the ism ,",
    "there exist different sources of turbulence driving , such as large - scale gravitational stirring and stellar feedback ( e.g. , mac low & klessen 2004 ; agertz et al .",
    "2009a ) , and it is still unclear how they affect the ism at various scales .",
    "understanding the origin and evolution of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and how they vary with galactic environment , is a daunting task for numerical simulations , given the vast dynamical range involved in the star - forming ism : from scales @xmath162 to scales @xmath163 .",
    "preliminary results from numerical simulations of entire galactic discs ( agertz , romeo & grisdale , in preparation ) show that large - scale gravitational stirring and stellar feedback can generate markedly different scaling properties in both @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "this is a promising and novel avenue for constraining the role of stellar feedback in galaxy evolution , a topic that we will address further in future work .",
