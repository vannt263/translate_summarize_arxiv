    "the physical property is crucial .",
    "especially , the physical property of dendrimers in solutions attracts quite a lot of attentions , because for many applications the dendrimers are immersed in a solvent .",
    "however , due to the complex molecular structure and excluded volume effect , the entire conformational property and scaling laws have not yet reached a complete consensus .",
    "\\(1 ) * density profile * :  hollow core \" model and  dense - core \" model    an early study on the structure of dendrimers was performed by de gennes and hervet @xcite in 1983 .",
    "they adopted a self - consistent field theory based on the assumption that  near the center the spacers may behave like flexible coils , but in the outer region they must be elongated\"@xcite .",
    "thus , the density profile of the dendrimer is minimum at the center and increases towards the edge .",
    "this is known as the `` hollow - core '' model ( or  dense - packing \" model ) .",
    "this model dominated the understanding on dendrimer for two decades and stimulated a lot application ideas@xcite , because the model implies a molecular capsule to packing functional drugs for delivery .",
    ".summary of scaling laws of dendrimer in solvents [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , in 1990 , in contrast to the  hollow - core \" model , lescanec and muthukumar @xcite reported a `` dense - core '' model based on a computer simulation , in which the density profile of the dendrimer is maximum at the center .",
    "after that , a great deal of works based on numerical simulation and calculation methods , such as monte carlo ( mc ) simulation @xcite , molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite , brownian dynamics ( bd ) @xcite , self - consistent field theory ( scft ) @xciteand density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , were published supporting the `` dense - core '' model .",
    "the results of different approaches agree on several features of single dendrimer system .",
    "first , the spacers of a small generation number are quite localized , which contributes to a high density peak at the center of dendrimer .",
    "second , with increasing the generation number , a density emerges besides the center density peak , which indicates the dendrimer transfers from a dilute one to a dense one .",
    "the experiments of small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) , moreover , confirm the `` dense - core '' model @xcite .",
    "although the  dense - core \" model is widely accepted nowadays , a local minimum valley between the center peak and the plateau region in the density profile , first discussed by mansfield and klushin @xcite , remains confusing .",
    "this minimum is found in all simulations with strong steric interactions when the generation number @xmath1 is large enough@xcite , but can disappear when the solvent is good@xcite .",
    "the minimum is not found in scft calculations where the volume interaction is replaced by a mean - field parameter@xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) * conformation * : the back - folding phenomenon and the terminal monomer distribution    according to the  hollow - core \" model , surface congestion occurs at the periphery of a dendrimer after a certain generation .",
    "the spacers are strongly stretched outwards , and consequently the free ends of the last generation distribute near the shell .",
    "however , the simulation works supporting  dense - core \" model found the terminal monomer spread through the whole dendrimer region@xcite .",
    "this indicates the strong back - folding tendency of the arms of the dendrimer .",
    "this phenomenon is confirmed by sans experiments@xcite .",
    "\\(3 ) * scaling laws ( with solvent ) *    the controversy over the scaling laws between the radius of gyration @xmath5 and other topological parameters of dendrimers , such as the monomer number @xmath3 , the spacer length @xmath2 and the generation number @xmath1 , never stops .",
    "the theoretical approaches predict different power laws in different models . in the  hollow - core \" model ,",
    "de gennes and hervet@xcite reported @xmath6 in good solvent ( athermal ) . in the  dense - core \" model , via a mean - field , flory - type free energy approach@xcite , the scaling law is @xmath7 in good solvent and @xmath8 in @xmath9 solvent . in the poor solvent limit ,",
    "the dendrimer is a dense sphere , so that @xmath10 .    in computer simulations and experiments , the scaling laws also do not agree with each other , as summarized in table  [ summary ] .",
    "a more detailed table summarizing different power law exponents in theoretical works and simulations can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to solve the problems listed above , we perform scft to study the conformations and scaling laws of a flexible dendron thoroughly .",
    "the scft for dendrimer system , first introduced by boris and rubinstein@xcite , adopts a pre - averaged potential to represent the two - body interaction between the monomers . in flory",
    "theory@xcite , this potential is interpreted as the effect of volume exclusion between the monomers of linear chains in a good solvent . comparing with md and mc with full steric interaction , scft with",
    "the pre - averaged , two - body interaction potential gives good expression of the monomer density profile and the power laws in good solvents , although it is hard to approach the high density limit where three - body interaction plays an important role .",
    "moreover , we study the dendron system instead of a full dendrimer , because the  dendron \" , defined as the branches at the first level of branching@xcite , is the basic building block of dendrimer , and holds all physical properties including the conformation and the power laws of dendrimer .",
    "moreover , in the experiments with an h - shaped core@xcite , the dendrimers can be considered as a dendron with the absence of the first generation .",
    "the first generation of the dendron mainly contributes to the localized center peak of density@xcite due to its topological position and small volume fraction .",
    "last but not least , dendron is attracting research attentions , such as the segregation of dendrons brushes@xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] we introduce the dendron model and the self - consistent field theory with excluded volume potential , and discuss the flory theory for the dendron . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] , we focus on the physical aspects ( density profile , folding - back conformation , stretching conformation and power laws ) of a dendrimer immersed in a good solvent via a detailed analyzing of our simulation data . in the last section ,",
    "we summarize the main results and draw the conclusion .",
    "we consider a dendron , the branch at the first level of a dendrimer molecule@xcite , immersed in a good solvent .",
    "the dendron consists of @xmath1 generations with the first segment fixed at the origin , as illustrated in fig.[fig : dendrimer model ] .",
    "we use @xmath11 to denote the generation number of the spacers .",
    "the branch monomer , denoted with a number @xmath12 , connects the @xmath11-th and the @xmath13-th spacer .",
    "the first monomer and the terminal monomers are denoted as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively . for simplicity , all the spacers , which are assumed to be flexible chains , have the same segment number @xmath2 .",
    "the total segment number is @xmath16 .",
    "we use the square root of the dendron s mean square center - end distance @xmath5 of a single linear side chain ( a no - backward route from @xmath14 to a terminal monomer @xmath15 ) of @xmath17 monomers to characterize the overall radial size .    , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the circles denote the branch monomers and the free end monomers , and the numbers inside the circle are corresponding @xmath12 values . in our simulation , we only calculate a dendron molecule ( the sharp colored area ) , which is one - third of a dendrimer , in full three - dimensional space . , width=302 ]    in the absence of excluded volume interactions , or in other words , when the dendron is immersed in a @xmath9 solvent , the conformation entropy achieves the maximum value with each linear side chain ( a no - backward route from @xmath14 to one end monomer @xmath15 ) assuming gaussian conformation .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 , the square root of the mean square distance from the first monomer @xmath14 to a terminal monomer @xmath15 , is the same as the mean end - to - end distance of a linear gaussian chain with segment number @xmath21@xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the segment kuhn length . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iiia ] , we confirm this power law by scft calculation .",
    "we consider the dendron immersed in a good solvent . so that the dendron is not dense . at any spacial point",
    ", we assume the local density of the monomer is low .",
    "the conformation is determined by the balance between the repulsive excluded volume interaction and the entropic energy .",
    "based on the idea of flory free energy for a single linear chain in good solvent@xcite , the free energy of a dendron is , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath26 is temperature , @xmath27 is the mean - field approximated , excluded volume parameter , ",

    "[ eqn : mfenergy ] and the pioneer mf calculations@xcite , we modified the calculation in several aspects listed as below .",
    "\\(1 ) the free energy eqn .",
    "[ eqn : mfenergy ] is based on the whole dendron molecule instead of a linear side chain .",
    "therefore , we assume that the entropic energy of dendron changes proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "although not verified by calculation yet , this is still a proper approximation if the stretching conformation does not deviate from the gaussian chain too much .",
    "for the second term on the right side of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : mfenergy ] , we replace the linear side chain length @xmath21 in the pioneer mf calculations@xcite with the total segment number @xmath3 .",
    "\\(2 ) neglect the three - body interaction term in sheng _",
    "et al._@xcite we assume the monomer density low enough that the three - body interaction is insignificant .    minimizing the free energy , we obtain a scaling law of the equilibrium size in terms of @xmath30 and @xmath27 , @xmath31 where @xmath27 is a phenomenological constant to describe the solvent property .",
    "we drop @xmath27 and simplify the power law as @xmath32 .",
    "scft was first introduced by edwards and developed by matsen @xcite and fredrikson @xcite et.al .",
    "it has been used successfully to study the thermodynamic equilibrium of polymers in its present form .",
    "however , the scft theory usually does not include the excluded volume interaction , which is absolutely important in dendrimer systems of high generation .",
    "therefore , we modified the theory by including a pre - averaged field @xmath33 into the hamiltonian to approximate the excluded volume interaction , where @xmath34 is the dimensionless local number density of the segments@xcite . the excluded volume of a single segment is characterized @xcite by @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the flory - huggins parameter between the segment and solvent , and @xmath38 is the volume of a segment .",
    "so the parameter @xmath27 describes the overall effect of the volume exclusion of the segments and the swelling of the solvent . at @xmath9 point with @xmath39 , where a slight incompatibility of solvent balances the excluded volume effect of segments , the property of dendron is similar to ideal gaussian case . as @xmath27 increases",

    "we specify the conformation of the dendron by a vector @xmath43 in three - dimensional space . for a given conformation ,",

    "therefore , suggested by the flory mean - field theory calculation and supported by our scft results , we verify the scaling law relation @xmath0 in the good solvent limit .",
    "in summary , we investigate the conformational behavior and scaling laws of dendrons immersed in a good solvent by using flory mean - field theory and scft method .",
    "our scft approach takes into account the excluded volume effect by using a pre - averaged potential describing the two - body interaction between monomers .",
    "we confirm the `` dense - core '' model of dendrons , accompanied by a persistent backfolding conformation , which never disappears with changing volume exclusion effect or solvent property .",
    "however , sufficiently strong volume exclusion depresses the density of the terminal monomers near the center , which provides the potential usage in drug delivery system . by analyzing the end - to - end distance of spacers of different generations",
    ", we find that different parts of a linear side chain of a dendron are under different stretching conditions .",
    "near the center of the dendron , the spacers are stretched strongly due to the volume exclusion effect of densed , localized monomers at the center .",
    "the stretching effect fades quickly with increasing the generation number of the spacer , and approaches to a limit number .",
    "therefore , for the spacers with large generation numbers , which are far from the center and mainly contribute to the shoulder region of the total monomer density , the stretching is relatively weak and homogeneous .",
    "last but not least , our scft results support very well our scaling calculation via the flory mean - field theory approach . at good solvent limit",
    ", we find the dendron size @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath133 .",
    "if we fix @xmath1 , the scaling law is simplified as @xmath4 , because @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "although we have only calculated the conformation of a dendron molecule , which is the primary branch of a dendrimer , our conclusions can be directly applied to dendrimers .",
    "a dendron can be considered as a dendrimer of @xmath134-shaped core with a small spacer suspended at the center . comparing with the huge molecule",
    ", the suspension chain only enhances the central density peak , and is impossible to strongly influence the other properties such as the scaling behavior and the stretching conformation .",
    "our future study interest is on the systems of confined dendron with interactions between spacers .",
    "the complex morphology is the balance of competition between the entropic depression of spacial confinement , the interfacial energy and the strong volume exclusion effect of the highly fractal configuration .      40 ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1 '' '' @noop [ 0]secondoftwo sanitize@url [ 0 ] ",
