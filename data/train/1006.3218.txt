    "molecular outflows are ubiquitous in star - forming regions , with every protostar thought to undergo a period of outflow activity ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "outflow observations provide unique information about the mass - loss history of the parent protostar and thereby the accretion process which determines its evolution .",
    "recently there has been renewed interest in the suggestion that outflows may drive turbulence in molecular clouds @xcite , given that the total energy they contain may be a significant portion of a molecular cloud s turbulent energy and they can cause much disruption of their natal environment ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "theoreticians are divided about whether an efficient mechanism exists to feed energy from a small quantity of fast - moving material in an outflowing jet into random isotropic motions on molecular cloud scales ( e.g.  @xcite versus @xcite ) .",
    "however , analyses of data from regions of molecular clouds with high densities of outflows suggest that outflows are not the dominant driving mechanism ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . if they were",
    ", then cloud lifetimes should be short ( consistent with the rapid formation scenario proposed by @xcite ) or the star formation rate very high ( see @xcite ) . in addition , the detection of outflows from candidate star - forming cores , located through say ( sub)millimetre continuum surveys ( e.g.  @xcite ) , offers a way to classify such sources as either starless or protostellar ( e.g.  @xcite ; hereafter ) , which complements methods based on their spectral energy distributions ( seds , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "molecular outflows have diverse structures , reflecting both their driving sources and environments",
    ". such diversity has lead to a wide range of plausible models ( see @xcite for a summary ) with no single model accounting for all the features of outflows observed to date .",
    "young , collimated outflows point to jet - driven models ( e.g.  @xcite ) , yet older , wider - angle outflows evoke wide - angle wind models ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "some observational studies even suggest a two - component wind is necessary ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in this paper we present a survey for molecular outflows towards the perseus molecular cloud ( hereafter simply perseus ) using our @xmath4co  @xmath1  datasets ( @xcite ; hereafter ) and data presented here for the first time towards ngc1333 , the most active regions of star formation in perseus .",
    "this outflow survey towards a single cloud is one of the largest to date , allowing us to look for statistical variations in outflow properties .",
    "this work is the second in a series of papers surveying the kinematics of molecular gas in perseus .",
    "presented the data acquisition and large - scale kinematic properties , whilst @xcite explores the detailed gas motions inside star - forming cores .",
    "this study is arranged as follows : section [ sec : observations ] describes the observations we analyse , in particular the new data towards ngc1333 , and presents an overview of the survey before listing the naming conventions we apply to star - forming cores in our fields . in section [ sec : outflow_detection_rates ] , we look for an outflow detection towards the position of every submillimetre core identified with scuba  @xcite and analyse the corresponding detection rates and core classifications .",
    "we set out the methods we have chosen to analyse the detected outflows in section [ sec : outflowparams_method ] ( the outflows themselves are described in appendix [ appendix : outflows ] ) before exploring the evolution of these parameters in section [ sec : outflowevolution ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the @xmath4co  @xmath1  data we analyse are towards the four largest clusters of star - forming cores in perseus ( see table [ table : regiondetails ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : overview ] for an overview of the data ) .",
    "the datacubes of ic348/hh211 , l1448 and l1455 have been published previously where we refer the reader for details of the reduction .",
    "briefly , the data were taken as ` basket - weaved ' scan maps using harp ( heterodyne array receiver project ; @xcite ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) over nine nights between december 2007 and january 2008 .",
    "the data were taken in good to excellent observing conditions with a median system temperature of @xmath12k .",
    "the final data products are sampled on a 3arcsec grid and are smoothed slightly spatially and spectrally to an equivalent full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) beam size of 16.8arcsec ( 0.020pc at 250pc , our assumed distance to perseus ) and velocity channel width of 1kms@xmath8  respectively .",

    "<S> furthermore , we confirm there are additional sources of mass loss from protostars . if a core s mass is only lost from outflows at the current rate , cores would endure a few million years , much longer than current estimates for the duration of the protostellar stage . finally , we note that the total energy contained in outflows in ngc1333 , l1448 and l1455 is greater than the estimated turbulent energy in the respective regions , which may have implications for the regions evolution .    </S>",
