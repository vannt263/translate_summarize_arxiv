    "_ @xcite discovered that the electrostriction of polyurethane film is large enough to be interesting .",
    "the measurements of wang , _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found a smaller electrostriction .",
    "the experiments are unexpectedly difficult , partly because the material is hygroscopic and its properties history - dependent , and partly because the measured electrostriction is affected by the confinement of the soft polyurethane by any stiffer material ( such as electrodes ) with which it is in contact .",
    "comparatively little work exists @xcite on the theory of electrostriction , and none directly applicable to this problem .",
    "we develop a simple theory of the electric susceptibility of polymers ( such as polyurethane ) with polar groups , and calculate electrostriction from the susceptibility .",
    "the theory has one parameter , which may be determined by comparing to the observed susceptibility .",
    "polyurethane elastomers are block copolymers containing crystallizable and noncrystallizable segments @xcite .",
    "the molecular structure of a generic polyurethane is shown in figure [ fig1 ] , with @xmath0 typically about 2 .",
    "the crystallizable ( hard ) segments have attached amide groups with permanent electric dipole moments @xmath1 esu - cm .",
    "our model for the susceptibility considers the orientation of the dipoles in the electric field , and for the moment neglects the intrinsic susceptibility of the nonpolar portions of the polyurethane . for comparison ,",
    "nonpolar polymers such as polyethylene typically have dielectric constants ( resulting entirely from polarization of the chemical bonds ) of about 2.3 , while polyurethanes have dielectric constants of about 6.8 .",
    "we make an independent particle approximation in which the dipoles in electrified polyurethane have two contributions to their energy  the usual electrostatic energy @xmath2 and a term resulting from their rotation from their equilibrium orientations .",
    "this latter energy results from the elastic restoring forces of the polymer chains and of the bulk medium ( entangled chains ) . for small deviations @xmath3 from the equilibrium position the elastic energy will ,",
    "in general , be quadratic in @xmath4 .",
    "we therefore write @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an elastic stiffness constant . for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath6 is a scalar so that @xmath7 depends only on the magnitude of the angular deflection , and not on its direction ; this may not be true for dipoles on a polymer , but in the absence of a detailed model for the orientation of the amide groups in polyurethane it is a reasonable approximation .",
    "if the applied electric field defines the @xmath8 axis of a polar coordinate system , and the orientation of the dipole defines the @xmath9 plane and makes an angle @xmath10 to the electric field , then @xmath4 is obtained from @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the equilibrium position of the dipole in the absence of a field .",
    "unfortunately [ eq2 ] becomes cumbersome when [ eq3 ] is substituted , and the integrals required to take thermal averages can not be done analytically .",
    "therefore , we replace [ eq2 ] by @xmath13 to second order in @xmath4 [ eq4 ] agrees with [ eq2 ] . because the actual calculation of @xmath7 for large @xmath4 is a problem in nonlinear elasticity , which would be quite difficult , there is no reason to think that [ eq4 ] is any less accurate than [ eq2 ] .",
    "the form [ eq4 ] may be rewritten @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a vector with the dimensions of an electric field which points in the direction of the equilibrium position of the dipole ( for @xmath16 ) , and which has magnitude @xmath17 .",
    "the effects of the elastic forces on the dipole have now been incorporated into the field @xmath15 , which will be assumed to be an isotropic random function of space with zero correlation length and fixed modulus @xmath18 .",
    "the total energy @xmath19 may be obtained from [ eq1 ] and [ eq5 ] , dropping the constant term in [ eq5 ] : @xmath20    we ignore the electrostatic and elastic interaction between dipoles , in effect assuming their density to be low .",
    "the physics of randomly oriented dipoles embedded in an amorphous elastic polymer matrix is described by the random field @xmath15 .",
    "if interactions between dipoles were to be included the problem would be that of a dipole glass , analogous to the familiar ( but difficult ) spin glass problem .",
    "we evaluate the mean polarization @xmath21 in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath22 . for a given dipole",
    "the energy [ eq6 ] leads , by the usual elementary calculation , to a polarization of magnitude @xmath23 along the direction of @xmath24 , where the langevin function @xmath25 the combined normalized effective field strength is @xmath26 and @xmath27 denotes a thermal average only .    the net polarization of the medium must , by symmetry , be in the direction ( @xmath28 ) of the applied field @xmath29 , and is found from @xmath30 where the overline represents a quenched angular average over all directions of @xmath15 and @xmath31 is the angle between @xmath29 and @xmath32 . upon expanding @xmath33 and @xmath34 in powers of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , and keeping only terms of first order in @xmath38 , we find @xmath39 note that while @xmath40 and @xmath41 are assumed , @xmath42 is generally not small . for a density @xmath43 of independent dipoles",
    "the macroscopic polarization @xmath44 may be obtained from [ eq11 ] : @xmath45 \\equiv np { { \\bf e } \\over { \\tilde e } } f(x_0 ) .",
    "\\label{eq12}\\ ] ] the function @xmath46 is plotted in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the limits of [ eq12 ] are @xmath47 the limit for @xmath48 is a familiar elementary result , while the limit for @xmath49 was given in slightly different form by frlich @xcite .",
    "polyurethanes typically have dielectric constants @xmath50 . using the relation ( in cgs units ) @xmath51",
    ", this yields a susceptibility @xmath52 .",
    "the self - consistent molecular polarizability @xmath53 ( here a scalar , but in general a tensor ) is @xmath54 where the last equality is the clausius - mossotti equation @xcite .",
    "this equation may be modified straightforwardly to allow for a dielectric constant @xmath55 of the continuum in which the dipoles are embedded .",
    "the result is @xmath56 for the polyurethane shown in figure [ fig1 ] with @xmath57 and density 1.1 gm/@xmath58 , the dipole density @xmath59 @xmath60 , assuming each amide group rotates independently .",
    "then , with @xmath61 esu - cm , the self - consistent solution to the transcendental equation [ eq15 ] , taking @xmath62k and @xmath63 , is @xmath64 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath65 cgs ( @xmath66 v / cm ) .",
    "it should be remembered that these numerical values depend on the assumed numerical values of @xmath43 and @xmath67 , which are poorly known .",
    "the twisting stiffness constant equivalent to the derived value of @xmath18 is @xmath68 erg .",
    "this may be compared to the macroscopic elastic constants of polyurethane , which typically has a young s modulus @xmath69 dyne/@xmath70 .",
    "if the dipole is described by a rigid sphere of radius @xmath71 , then rotation by an angle @xmath72 implies a strain @xmath73 , a tangential stress on the surface of the sphere @xmath74 , and a total torque @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding stiffness constant @xmath76 , so that @xmath77 .",
    "this value is not unreasonable , although perhaps a bit large , but its significance is uncertain : the dipoles are mechanically coupled to their environment in complex ways .",
    "they are parts of a nearly inextensible and flexurally stiff covalently bonded polymer chain , which can shear quite easily with respect to its neighbors , except as limited by entanglements .",
    "these elastic properties are strongly temperature dependent , so that @xmath18 will also be sensitive to temperature , at least for temperatures of order room temperature .",
    "most of the temperature dependence of [ eq11 ] and [ eq12 ] is likely to come from the variation of @xmath18 with @xmath22 , rather than from the explicit dependence on @xmath22 , except perhaps at very low temperatures .",
    "in fact , some polar polymers are known @xcite to have values of @xmath78 which increase rapidly with @xmath22 , as this argument would suggest .",
    "the derivation of [ eq12 ] is limited to small electric fields .",
    "the effective electric field @xmath79 acting on an object in an amorphous medium is ( in cgs units ) @xmath80 where we have taken the empirical dielectric constant of polyurethane . in order for [ eq12 ] to be valid the conditions @xmath81 and @xmath82 must both be met",
    "; when they are not met @xmath83 becomes a significant fraction of @xmath67 , the polarization saturates , and @xmath78 , @xmath84 , and the electrostriction decrease below the values given by the low field theory .",
    "the available strong - field data@xcite only describe the electrostriction , and show that it saturates at @xmath85 cgs , corresponding to @xmath86 cgs , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "we expect the susceptibility to saturate at the same field strengths as does the electrostriction , a prediction which is readily tested .",
    "the electrostriction saturates at fields substantially smaller than expected . this discrepancy may be resolved if the actual rotating dipole moments consist of a number of individual amide groups , locked together by crystallization of the hard segments of the polymer .",
    "such a rigid block would have a value of @xmath67 several times that of an individual amide group , and @xmath43 would represent the density of such blocks and would be correspondingly smaller than the density of individual amide groups .",
    "the value of @xmath89 would not be greatly changed by this locking of individual amides into a single giant dipole . because @xmath46 is a slowly varying function for @xmath90 , @xmath18 would also not be greatly changed .",
    "the landau theory of electrostriction defines a free energy per unit volume of a body in an imposed stress field @xmath91 and electric field @xmath92 : @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are lam coefficients of elasticity , @xmath96 is the strain tensor , @xmath91 is the stress tensor , @xmath97 is the inverse of the susceptibility tensor @xmath98 defined by @xmath99 , @xmath100 is the electrostriction tensor , and @xmath101 and @xmath92 are the polarization and electric field . in this theory @xmath96 and @xmath101",
    "describe the internal state of the material , and characterize its response to the externally imposed parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "if we neglect fluctuations , which are small far from phase transitions , @xmath96 and @xmath101 may be found by minimizing [ eq19 ] .    by multiply differentiating the legendre transform of [ eq19 ] @xmath102 in various orders we can relate @xmath100 to the derivatives of @xmath97 with respect to @xmath103 : @xmath104 _ i.e. , _ @xmath105 where [ eq21b ] has been obtained by using the thermodynamic relations @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "we then use our elementary microscopic model of @xmath84 to calculate @xmath100 from the second part of [ eq21b ] : @xmath108 .",
    "the application of a strain component @xmath109 to an isotropic distribution of vectors @xmath15 ( the equilibrium orientations of the dipoles ) rotates them .",
    "we assume that the magnitude @xmath18 is not changed by the application of the strain field .",
    "we do not know if this is true , but it could not be described except by a completely phenomenological parameter , which we have no independent means of determining .",
    "the angle between @xmath110 and the @xmath111 axis is rotated by an amount , found from elementary geometry @xmath112 the calculation of susceptibility is then repeated , replacing @xmath10 by @xmath113 , with the result , correct to first order in @xmath109 , @xmath114,\\ ] ] where the function @xmath115 is defined @xmath116,\\ ] ] and is plotted in figure [ fig2 ] . by considerations of symmetry ( or explicit calculation ) it is seen that @xmath117 is diagonal , as is @xmath98 , so that @xmath118",
    ". then , to lowest order in @xmath109 , noting that @xmath119 and @xmath120 , we have @xmath121 we have neglected the dependence on strain of the susceptibility of the continuum medium in which the dipoles are embedded ; any such dependence is likely to be very small , especially in a soft elastomer in which deformations are almost purely volume - conserving .    the effects of strain components @xmath122 and @xmath123 may be found similarly : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath15 , measured from the y - axis .",
    "then @xmath126 similar calculations for @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 ( or symmetry arguments ) show that @xmath130 similarly , because the distribution of @xmath15 retains inversion symmetry in the strained state in all of these strained configurations @xmath98 remains diagonal , so that @xmath131 for @xmath132 .",
    "permutation of indices leads to the general result @xmath133    we now calculate the electrostrictive strain produced by the application of an electric field and polarization in the @xmath134 direction . differentiating [ eq19 ] with respect to @xmath103 , and setting the derivative equal to zero in equilibrium yields @xmath135 the electrostrictive term acts as an effective stress @xmath136 note that linearizing [ eq31a ] about a state of nonzero @xmath137 leads to @xmath138 _ i.e. _ , an effective piezoelectric response . using [ eq25 ] , [ eq27 ] and [ eq28 ] yields @xmath139 @xmath140",
    "the off - diagonal components are zero .",
    "substitution in the elastic stress - strain relation ( or use of [ eq30 ] ) yields the strain @xmath141 @xmath142 where the bulk modulus @xmath143 .    in order to rewrite [ eq33 ] in terms of @xmath144 the clausius - mossotti equation [ eq14 ] , [ eq15 ]",
    "may be solved for @xmath84 in terms of @xmath145 , but because @xmath84 is measured it is easier simply to substitute @xmath146 : @xmath147 @xmath148    for materials which are soft to shear , with @xmath149 ( as in many polymers ) the second terms in parentheses of [ eq33 ] and [ eq34 ] are small compared to the first terms .",
    "it is evident that materials with small shear moduli @xmath94 ( or small young s moduli , equal to @xmath150 in the limit @xmath151 ) will show comparatively large electrostrictive strains .",
    "in addition , even though typically @xmath152 , the strain @xmath153 and materials with large @xmath84 ( but small @xmath154 ) are usually the best electrostrictors @xcite .",
    "substitution in [ eq34 ] for pt6100s polyurethane @xcite , which has @xmath155 erg/@xmath58 , taking @xmath156 , and using the estimated @xmath43 and @xmath67 and the value of @xmath18 previously determined from the susceptibility , yields @xmath157 , where the esu is the cgs unit of charge ( @xmath158 coulomb ) .",

    "the result [ eq34 ] contains no free parameters because the ratio @xmath164 is determined from the measured dielectric constant by [ eq15 ] , as is @xmath84 , and @xmath94 is directly measured .",

    "it is evident that there are no body forces on a uniformly electrified homogeneous material , but it is still of interest to examine the strain field @xmath165 produced by a point torque in an elastic medium , such as the permanent dipoles in electric fields discussed in this paper , in order to see if this strain contributes to the electrostriction .",
    "this result not readily found in the elasticity literature .",
    "begin with kelvin s result for the displacement field @xmath165 produced by a point force @xmath166 at the origin of an elastic medium @xcite : @xmath167 where @xmath168 is poisson s ratio , @xmath169 denotes the point at which the displacement is measured , and @xmath170 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath169 . by adding to [ eqa1 ] the displacement produced by a force @xmath171 acting at a point @xmath172 we find the displacment produced by a point torque @xmath173 : @xmath174    a dipole @xmath175 in an electric field @xmath29 is subject to a torque @xmath176 in a medium with an inversion - symmetric distribution of dipole orientations @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",

    "the rotation of the dipoles changes the direction of their moments , and therefore the torque .",
    "the change in @xmath175 is @xmath180 and yields an incremental torque , second order in @xmath29 ( like the electrostriction ) : @xmath181 although [ eqa5 ] is second order in both @xmath175 and @xmath29 , in any volume element it will average to zero for an inversion - symmetric distribution of @xmath175 , and hence it is not a useful model of electrostriction .",
    "uchino , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite note that the electrostriction coefficient @xmath154 and the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath182 are empirically related by @xmath183 for a wide variety of materials , including one polymer ( pvdf ) , pyrex glass , ceramic piezoelectrics , and ionic crystals ( see their figure 1 ) ; there is only a factor of 2 ( in @xmath182 ) or 4 ( in q ) scatter about the power law fit , which extends over a range of about 30 in @xmath182 ( 1000 in @xmath154 ) .",
    "this empirical relation has a very elementary explanation .",
    "the simplest model of thermal expansion is a particle in a weakly anharmonic potential @xmath184 .",
    "if the particle has an energy @xmath185 , its turning points are shifted by @xmath186 , giving a linear thermal expansion coefficient @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the distance between the potential minimum and the origin ( or the nearest neighboring particle ) .",

    "the displacement of their barycenter is @xmath193 , giving an electrostrictive coefficient @xmath194 ( note that @xmath195 for realistic potentials ) .",
    "if the chief variation between materials is in @xmath71 then @xmath196 , as observed ; the scatter about this relation arises from variations in @xmath197 , @xmath188 , and the effective charge @xmath198 .",
    "the parameter @xmath71 is related to the bulk modulus , which varies a great deal between materials ; it is not surprising that variations in the other variables are less important , though not insignificant .",
    "it is possible to construct a very simple model of electrostriction of a melted polyurethane , with no elastic resistance to rotation of the permanent dipoles .",
    "suppose the polymer configuration to be a random walk which deviates from isotropy because an applied electric field distorts the equilibrium distribution of the orientations of the dipoles ( for small anisotropy the self - avoiding property of the walk will not change the degree of anisotropy ) .",

    "each polymer @xmath204 can now be regarded as a biased random walk , whose mean square end - to - end distance grows anisotropically as a function of arc length @xmath205[r_j(s ) - r_j(0)]\\rangle = ( 2 d_{ij } s)^{2\\eta}$ ] . for chain elements of unit length",
    "the random walk is described by a diagonal diffusion tensor , correct to second order in @xmath206 , @xmath207 @xmath208 @xmath209 where the subscript @xmath210 refers to the components of the dipole vectors .",

    "this strain will make the material optically active , but in order to calculate this it would be necessary to know the intrinsic dielectric anisotropy of the polymer chain at optical frequencies ; optical activity is determined by the strain alone , and is not specific to its electrostrictive origin .",
