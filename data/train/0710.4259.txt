    "this paper is concerned with proving ergodicity of mechanical systems governed by langevin - type equations driven by levy processes and with a singular diffusion matrix applied on the momentums .",
    "such systems arise , for instance , when one models stochastically forced mechanical systems composed of rigid bodies . in such systems",
    "one would like to introduce a certain structure to the noise and observe its effect on the dynamics of the system .",
    "for instance , one would like to apply stochastic forcing to a single degree of freedom and characterize the ergodicity of the system .",
    "the stochastic process associated to the dynamics of these systems is in general only weak feller and not strong feller .",
    "the paper provides a concrete weak feller ( but not strong feller ) stochastic process to illustrate this lack of regularity .",
    "the example is a simple mechanical system that is randomly forced and torqued and that preserves the gibbs measure . in this case",
    "one would like to determine if this gibbs measure is the unique , invariant measure of the system .    a new strategy based on the introduction of the _ asymptotically strong feller _ property has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "this paper proposes an alternative method based on two conditions : weak irreducibility and closure under second randomization of the stochastic forcing ( see theorem [ ksjhskjsh223 ] ) .",
    "our strategy is in substance similar to the one proposed by meyn and tweedie for discrete markov chains in chapter 7 of @xcite .    although the hrmander condition ( @xcite 38.16 ) can also be used to obtain local regularity properties of the semi - group , hence a local strong feller condition and ergodic properties .",
    "the alternative approach proposed here does nt require smooth vector fields or manifolds , it can directly be applied to levy processes and ( this is our main motivation ) it allows for an explicit geometric understanding of the mechanisms supporting ergodicity .    for related previous work",
