    "the notion of the photon structure function @xmath2 was introduced in analogy to the well known nucleon case .",
    "the first measurements of @xmath2  became available from @xmath3 collisions which could be interpreted as processes in which a highly virtual photon , of virtuality @xmath4 , probes an almost real target photon , with virtuality @xmath5 0 .",
    "while the proton structure function @xmath6 has been well measured , @xmath2 data are poor and limited mainly to the high bjorken@xmath1 region ( @xmath7 0.05 )  @xcite .",
    "this limitation comes largely because it is not easy to measure @xmath8 interactions at high center of mass energies , @xmath9 .",
    "the measured data of @xmath2  have been used to determine the quark distributions in the photon  @xcite in much the same way as the parton densities in the proton are determined  @xcite . however , contrary to the proton case , the gluon density in the photon is quite badly determined since no simple momentum sum rule can be applied .",
    "recently , a sum rule for the virtual target photon case ( @xmath10 0 ) has been devised by gurvich and frankfurt  @xcite .",
    "it can be extrapolated to the real photon case ( @xmath11 = 0 ) .",
    "most of the presently known parameterizations of the gluon in the photon , @xmath12 , violate this sum rule .",
    "data at @xmath4 = 5.3 gev@xmath13 ( dots ) together with some parton parameterizations ( lines ) .",
    "( b ) the gluon density distributions as obtained by the sas ( full line ) , grv ( dashed line ) and lac ( dash - dotted line ) parameterizations . ]    as one example of the present situation concerning parton distributions in the photon we show in figure  [ fig : f2g-5.3]a the measured data of @xmath2  at a probing virtuality of @xmath4 = 5.3 gev@xmath13 as function of @xmath1  @xcite compared to three chosen parameterizations sas  @xcite , lac  @xcite and grv  @xcite .",
    "the data show a slight decrease as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "the parameterizations , all of which give similar values in the region where they were fitted to the data , differ appreciably in the low@xmath1 region which is not constrained by the measurements . in figure",
    "[ fig : f2g-5.3]b the inferred gluon density distribution at the same @xmath4 is shown as function of @xmath1 .",
    "the distributions of the different parameterizations differ in the whole @xmath1 region .",
    "obtained from the frankfurt ",
    "gurvich sum rule for the photon ( full line ) as function of @xmath4 for the real photon case , compared to the results obtained from various parton parameterizations , as denoted in the figure ( see text ) . ]    in figure  [ fig : sumrule ] we present the quantity @xmath14 which is constrained by the frankfurt  gurvich sum rule  @xcite in the real photon case , as function of @xmath4 , for the case of light quarks only .",
    "in addition the moment is compared to the results obtained from various parton parameterizations : whit13  @xcite , dg1  @xcite , grv  lo , sas1d and lac . as can be seen , only the sas parameterization is close to the expectations of the sum rule .    in the present note",
    "we use gribov factorization  @xcite as suggested in  @xcite to constrain the behaviour of @xmath2  at low @xmath1 from the data of @xmath6 .",
    "we then use this extended set of data to extract the leading order parton distributions in the photon .",
    "gribov factorization  @xcite is based on the assumption that at high energies the total cross section of two interacting particles is determined by the property of the universal pomeron trajectory .",
    "this implies relations between total cross sections of various interacting particles .",
    "in particular , the gribov factorization can be used  @xcite to relate the total @xmath15 cross section , @xmath16 , with that of photoproduction , @xmath17 , and that of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , all at the same center of mass energy squared @xmath20 .",
    "using the assumption made in  @xcite that at low@xmath1 gribov factorization is applicable also for virtual photons , one can relate the proton and the real photon structure functions in a simple way  @xcite    @xmath21    relation  ( [ eq : fac - f2 ] ) allows the use of well measured quantities like total cross sections and the proton structure function @xmath6 to predict the values of the photon structure function @xmath2  in the region of low@xmath1 where equation  ( [ eq : fac - f2 ] ) is expected to be valid . since this is also the region where direct measurements of the photon structure function are difficult and not available",
    ", the use of  ( [ eq : fac - f2 ] ) provides a way to ` obtain ' @xmath2  ` data ' and use them as an additional source , on top of the direct measurements of @xmath2  , to constrain the parton distributions in the photon .",
    "we have used data on @xmath2  in order to obtain the parton distributions in the photon , in a similar way to the procedure used in  @xcite .",
    "we have applied a leading order evolution equation , using four flavours , and assumed the following simple parameterization forms for the partons , at a starting scale of @xmath22 = 4 gev@xmath13 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a suppression factor , having the value 1 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 quarks , and @xmath24 = 0.3 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 quarks .",
    "the charge of the quarks is denoted by @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are parameters to be determined from a fit to the @xmath2  data .",
    "we have used all available @xmath2  data  @xcite  @xcite together with the indirect ` data ' obtained through relation  ( [ eq : fac - f2 ] ) .",
    "the latter was obtained by using the data of the proton structure function  @xcite for @xmath32 0.01 . for the total photoproduction cross section and the total @xmath18 cross sections",
    ", we used the donnachie ",
    "landshoff parameterizations  @xcite , which give a good representation of the total cross section data . for the measured @xmath2  data",
    ", we used as errors the statistical and systematical errors added in quadrature . for the ` data ' as obtained through relation  ( [ eq : fac - f2 ] ) we used an additional systematic error of 3% as an estimate of the uncertainty coming from assuming the gribov factorization to hold also for the virtual photon case at low@xmath1 .    the parameters in  ( [ eq : param1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : param2 ] ) were determined from a best fit to the data .",
    "we used 241 data points and obtained a @xmath33 value of 162 .",
    "the results of the best fit are displayed in figure  [ fig : f2g - all ] .     for fixed @xmath4 values as indicated in the figure .",
    "the full points are the direct measurements and the open triangles are those obtained from @xmath6 through the gribov factorization relation ( 1 ) .",
    "the full line is the result of the present fit as described in the text , the dashed line is that of the grv  lo parameterization , and the dotted line is that of sas . ]",
    "the directly measured photon structure function data appear as full points , while the data obtained through the use of the gribov factorization are displayed as open triangles .",
    "we displayed the @xmath2data of @xmath4 = 5.09 ( tpc/2@xmath34 ) and 5.1 ( topaz ) in the same figure labeled 5.2 gev@xmath13 .",
    "we also show the data of @xmath4 of 23 ( tasso ) and 24 ( jade ) gev@xmath13 in one bin of @xmath4 = 23.5 gev@xmath13 .",
    "all the low@xmath1 data coming from the proton structure function have been scaled to the value of @xmath4 which is indicated in the figure .",
    "the solid curves are the results of the present parameterization . for comparison",
    "we show as dashed lines the results of the grv - lo parameterization which differ substantially from the present parameterization in the low@xmath1 region .",
    "the results of the sas parameterization , also shown , are very close to those of the present parameterization .",
    "the photon structure function data exhibit a minimum in the range @xmath35 , which is broad at lower @xmath4 and gets sharper as @xmath4 increases .",
    "the increase of @xmath2  with decreasing @xmath1 is not surprising since it is an outcome of the factorization assumption which uses the proton structure function data .",
    "the results of the new parameterization , which give a good fit to the data in the whole @xmath1 region , can be confronted with the expectations of the frankfurt ",
    "gurvich sum rule .",
    "this constraint was not used in the fit . the sum rule using the new parameterization agree with the theoretical expectations within 5% .",
    "the only other parameterization which is close to fulfilling the expected sum rule is that of sas .    , for fixed values of @xmath4 , as calculated from the present parameterization . ]    in figure  [ fig : gluon ] we present the gluon momentum density as calculated from the form  ( [ eq : param2 ] ) as function of @xmath1 , for a few fixed values of @xmath4 .",
    "the gluon density increases as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "one sees also the increase of the gluon momentum density with @xmath4 , at a given value of @xmath1 .",
    "this is a reflection of the feature that the photon structure function has a positive scaling violation at all values of @xmath1 , contrary to the proton case .",
    "we have extracted the leading order parton distributions in the photon by using the existing @xmath2  measurements and the low@xmath1 proton structure function . the latter is related to the photon structure function by assuming gribov factorization to hold at low @xmath1 .",
