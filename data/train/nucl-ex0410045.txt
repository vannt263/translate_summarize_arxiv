    "heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies provide a means to study the properties of nuclear matter at high temperature and density . in such collisions",
    "it is expected that a high density interaction zone is formed .",
    "if this system thermalizes , the thermal pressure will generate collective transverse expansion @xcite . such collective flow , and especially its anisotropy ,",
    "will reflect the time evolution of the pressure gradients of the system and can provide information on the equation of state ( eos ) in the initial phase @xcite and during the expansion @xcite , and in particular about the possible formation of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "qgp formation requires high energy density and local thermalisation of the system .",
    "while transverse energy measurements indicate the attainment of high energy densities @xcite , the degree of thermalization has not been unambiguously determined .",
    "measurements of collective flow may be one of the strongest hints related to the degree of thermalisation .",
    "one may consider two extreme cases : the low density limit , where the mean free path is comparable or larger than the system size for which cascade models may be appropriate , and the hydrodynamic limit , where the mean free path of the particles is much less than the system size .",
    "the study of collective flow as a function of beam energy and system size , transverse and longitudinal momentum , and particle species may allow to separate these two scenarios and to recognize the hadronic or partonic ( qgp ) nature of the reaction @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic flow of charged fragments has been measured in nuclear collisions at various beam energies : at 0.11.0 a gev @xcite , at @xmath4a gev @xcite , at @xmath0a gev @xcite and also at @xmath5 and @xmath6 gev @xcite .",
    "the first @xmath1-integrated photon flow measurement was performed by the wa93 experiment @xcite for 200 a gev s+au collisions , where photons were measured with the photon multiplicity detector ( pmd ) . in the present work",
    "we report first results of photon collective flow measurements in 158 a gev pb+pb collisions using photons identified and momentum analyzed in the lead glass calorimeter leda of the wa98 experiment .",
    "preliminary results have been presented in  @xcite .",
    "the data presented here were obtained in the wa98 experiment @xcite for 158 a gev pb+pb collisions at the cern sps . the wa98 setup consisted of large acceptance hadron and photon spectrometers , calorimeters for forward and transverse energy measurements , and detectors for photon and charged particle multiplicity measurements .",
    "the centrality of the event was determined by the total transverse energy , @xmath7 , measured with the mid - rapidity calorimeter ( mirac )  @xcite , which covered the pseudo - rapidity range of @xmath8 .",
    "it was placed at 24.7 meters downstream from the target and consisted of 30 stacks , each divided vertically into 6 towers , of size 20 x 20 @xmath9 each .",
    "the mirac measured both the transverse electromagnetic @xmath10 and hadronic @xmath11 energies .",
    "events with large @xmath7 correspond to the most central collisions with small impact parameter .",
    "the minimum bias trigger required a beam trigger with a mirac transverse energy greater than a low threshold .",
    "the plastic ball spectrometer , used for the reaction plane ( rp ) determination , had full azimuthal coverage in the pseudorapidity range of @xmath12 ( i.e. in the target fragmentation region with polar angles @xmath13 ) .",
    "it consisted of 655 detector modules and allowed to identify pions , protons , deutrons , tritons , @xmath14he , and @xmath15he with kinetic energies of 50 to 250 mev by the @xmath16 method .",
    "each module comprised a slow 4 mm thick caf@xmath17 @xmath18 scintillator followed by a fast plastic scintillator , both read out by a common photomultiplier @xcite .",
    "photons , of which @xmath19 originate from @xmath20 decay @xcite , were detected in the electromagnetic calorimeter leda , a highly segmented photon detector located 22.1 m downstream of the target and covering the photon rapidity region @xmath3",
    ", i.e. backwards of mid - rapidity ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "leda consisted of 10080 tf1 lead - glass modules , read out by feu-84 photomultipliers .",
    "the photomultiplier high voltage was generated on - base with custom developed @xcite cockcroft - walton voltage - multiplier type bases which were individually controlled by a vme processor .",
    "the photomultiplier signals were digitized with a custom - built adc system @xcite .",
    "the dimensions of each module were 4x4x40 @xmath22 ( 14.3 radiation lengths depth and 1.1 moliere radius width ) .",
    "each group of 24 modules had its own calibration and gain monitoring system based on a set of 3 leds mounted inside a sealed reflecting cover dome .",
    "each module viewed the reflected led light through an aperture on the front surface , while the led light was simultaneously monitored by a pin - photodiode @xcite .",
    "leda was calibrated with 10 gev electrons in the x1 beam at the cern sps in the years 1993 - 1994 .",
    "electron beams with energies from 3 gev to 20 gev were used to measure the energy and position resolution , and the energy non - linearity .",
    "the measured energy resolution was @xmath23 and the measured position resolution was @xmath24 .",
    "a more detailed description of the wa98 setup is given in @xcite .",
    "two complementary methods have been used in this analysis of anisotropic flow : the study of single - particle angular distributions with respect to an estimated reaction plane ( _ reaction plane method _ ) and the study of two - particle correlations ( _ correlation method _ ) .",
    "both methods assume that the underlying azimuthal distribution of particles with respect to the reaction plane ( rp ) , which is the plane that contains the impact parameter and beam direction vectors , can be described by a fourier decomposition : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the azimuthal angle of the emitted particle , and @xmath27 is the azimuthal angle of the rp .",
    "the anisotropic flow is characterized by the values of the fourier coefficients @xmath28 , for directed flow , and @xmath29 , for elliptic flow .      the conventional reaction plane method @xcite uses the distribution of particles in their azimuthal angle relative to the estimated reaction plane . because the true reaction plane is not known in the experiment",
    ", one has to establish an _ event plane _ ( ep ) from the measured particles as an estimate for the reaction plane .",
    "particles measured in the target fragmentation region show significant directed flow ",
    "proton , deuterons , and heavier fragments are emitted in the reaction plane in one direction , while pions are emitted in the opposite direction , as has been measured with the plastic ball detector  @xcite .",
    "this information has been used to calculate an event plane angle from the particles measured in the plastic ball : @xmath30 where the sum runs over all fragments and identified positive pions . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the transverse kinetic energy and azimuthal angle in the laboratory frame of the @xmath33th particle , respectively . for pions ,",
    "@xmath26 was replaced by @xmath34 to account for the opposite sign pion directed flow  @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal distribution of photons detected by the leda calorimeter has been studied relative to this event plane angle .",
    "the distributions are studied as a function of @xmath35 and are fitted with : @xmath36    the measured ep does nt coincide exactly with the true rp because of the finite number of detected particles and resulting fluctuations . because of this finite reaction plane resolution , the coefficients obtained from the fits have to be corrected by dividing them by the event plane resolution correction factors ( rcf@xmath37 ) : @xmath38    the resolution correction functions rcf@xmath37 are given by  @xcite : @xmath39       \\label{eq : cf }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the true rp angle , @xmath40 is the resolution parameter , which is proportional to the square root of the multiplicity , @xmath41 is the order of the fourier component used for calculation of the event plane and @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath27 is unknown , the rcf s must be determined from the measured ep themselves .",
    "this can be done by a subevent analysis in which each event , in this case consisting of hits in the plastic ball detector , is randomly divided into two subevents ( a and b ) and for each subevent the ep angle @xmath43 ( @xmath44 or @xmath45 ) is calculated .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 is determined directly from the subevent correlation function .",
    "it is then used in equation  [ eq : cf ] to obtain the parameter @xmath47 for the subevent multiplicity , which is then used to calculate @xmath48 for the full event , and finally to obtain @xmath49 . in this analysis",
    "we have used @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) for @xmath52 and for @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "alternatively , the flow values have been obtained from the azimuthal correlations of photon pairs as described in @xcite .",
    "the correlation function is calculated as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath57 are calculated as the ratio of the true two - photon distribution to the pair distribution from mixed events .",
    "this is necessary to correct for distortions from the limited acceptance of the photon detector . in the event - mixing procedure we have taken care to mix only events with similar global properties and to use identical cuts , especially regarding the two - cluster separation within the detector .",
    "the two - photon correlation functions have then been fitted with : @xmath58 from these fits , no significant @xmath28 component was observed . since very little directed flow",
    "is expected near mid - rapidity , we have set @xmath59 in this analysis .",
    "if collective flow is dominant , this method should be equivalent to the previous one since ( a ) the correlation between every particle and the rp induces a correlation amongst the particles , and ( b ) correlating two subevents amounts to summing two - particle correlations @xcite .",
    "the correlation method has the advantage that no ep determination , and therefore no resolution correction , is needed .",
    "however , non - flow correlations , such as back - to - back correlations due to momentum conservation  @xcite , should be taken into account .",
    "the data presented here were taken in 1995 and 1996 with the 158 a gev pb ion beams of the cern sps .",
    "pb targets of 495 and 239 mg/@xmath9 thickness were used . about @xmath60 events were analyzed .",
    "the events were divided into 8 centrality classes defined by intervals in the total @xmath7 measured by mirac , as summarized in table  [ tab : cent ] .",
    "the centralities are expressed as fractions of the minimum bias cross sections as a function of the total @xmath7 , measured by mirac .",
    "in addition , a multiplicity of greater than 3 fragments measured in the plastic ball was demanded to allow for a reasonable determination of the ep .",
    "this has a significant effect for the peripheral bins and causes a slight bias towards higher multiplicity within the bin .",
    "in addition to the 8 classes of centrality shown in table  [ tab : cent ] , studies were performed with combined centrality classes : 2  +  3 ( 4783% ) , 4  +  5  +  6 ( 1347% ) and 7  +  8 ( 013% ) .",
    "the table also shows the number of participants @xmath61 as calculated in a glauber type calculation discussed in @xcite .    to further suppress the hadron contamination in the photon sample ,",
    "only those showers in the calorimeter have been used which satisfy the following cuts :    * the measured energy was greater than 0.75  gev .",
    "this cut suppressed minimum ionizing particles . *",
    "the lateral dispersion of the shower was less than a maximum value .",
    "this suppressed showering hadrons .",
    "these cuts kept the hadron contamination in the photon sample to less than @xmath62 @xcite .",
    ".centrality classes used in this analysis .",
    "the percentage of the measured minimum bias cross section included in each class is given .",
    "also given is the corresponding average number of participants for each class with an estimate of the systematic error .",

    "the measured photon @xmath64 for each centrality was used for the @xmath65 of the simulated pions . the output @xmath66 of the simulated decay photons was compared to the measured photon dependence and used to adjust the @xmath20 @xmath63 for the next iteration .",
    "the procedure was iterated until the simulated and measured photon results were in agreement , which typically required two to three iterations .",
    "the @xmath67 and @xmath68 coefficients obtained from the fit to the photon results and the coefficients extracted for the @xmath20 s by the iteration procedure are summarized in table  [ tab : blast ] .",
    "the ratio of the flow coefficients extracted for the simulated decay photons to the input pion flow coefficients provided the correction factors @xmath69 used to extract the @xmath20 @xmath63 from the measured photon @xmath63 for @xmath70 gev@xmath71 .",
    "the systematic errors on the @xmath72 were determined from the uncertainties @xmath73 of the fit parameters : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . within errors ,",
    "the final results were found to be consistent with an analysis in which a simple linear @xmath1 dependence of the @xmath78 was assumed .",
    "[ fig5]a , b shows @xmath79 , the ratio of the flow coefficients of photons and pions , obtained from the simulations .",

    "the systematic errors on the wa98 points including the errors of the measured photon @xmath63 values and the additional error of the @xmath91 correction are less than @xmath92 , except for the lowest @xmath1 points where the upper systematic errors increase ( fig .",

    "[ fig9 ] shows the wa98 @xmath20 @xmath29 coefficient deduced from the measured photon @xmath29 ( corrected by @xmath95 ) together with a compilation of results  @xcite from other experiments .",
    "results are shown from e877  @xcite , ceres  @xcite , na49  @xcite , phobos  @xcite , phenix  @xcite , and star  @xcite , the wa98 result follows the general trend of the smooth increase of the elliptic flow with increasing beam energy .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the @xmath1 and rapidity coverages as well as centrality selections differ for the various experiments .",
    "since the strength of the elliptic flow should be proportional to the initial eccentricity of the collision zone , it is useful to normalize the measured @xmath29 to the eccentricity of the reaction geometry when investigating the systematics of the elliptical flow  @xcite .",
    "the initial spatial eccentricity was calculated within a glauber model calculation  @xcite as :    @xmath96 where x and y are the participant nucleon coordinates in the plane perpendicular to the beam and x denotes the in - plane direction .",
    "it is of interest to plot the quantity @xmath97 versus the particle density as estimated by the @xmath98 of charged particles divided by the area of the overlap region s  @xcite .",
    "neglecting the weak incident energy and centrality dependence of the average @xmath1 , the scaled particle density is proportional to the initial energy density in the bjorken estimate  @xcite .",
    "fig.10 shows the wa98 result for @xmath97 for neutral pions together with results for charged pions from na49 @xcite and results for charged particles from star @xcite and e877 @xcite .",
    "the rhic data have been corrected for their @xmath1 cutoff , the errors are statistical . for",
    "the wa98 points the @xmath98 are taken from wa98 measurements  @xcite .",
    "the wa98 results confirm the previous observation  @xcite of a universal dependence of @xmath97 on the particle density .",
    "it should be noted that results at different incident energies but similar average particle density correspond to dramatically different collision geometries .",
    "generally , a central collision at low energy will have a particle density similar to a more peripheral collision at higher energy .",
    "thus , the universal dependence demonstrates that the scaled @xmath29 depends only on the initial energy density , or initial pressure , rather than being dependent on the particle density times pathlength , which would be the expectation if only partial thermalization was attained .",
    "the observed increase of the scaled elliptic flow with increasing particle density is qualitatively similar to that seen in a recent hydrodynamical model study  @xcite in which the @xmath29 value for fixed impact parameter increases smoothly with increasing @xmath99 corresponding to the increase in pressure .",
    "that systematic study of hadron spectra and flow results indicated that existing data are best reproduced by hydrodynamic model calculations with an equation of state which include a transition to a quark gluon plasma phase at a critical temperature of @xmath100 mev with a latent heat of 800 mev  @xcite .",
    "directed and elliptic flow of photons have been measured in 158 a gev pb+pb collisions using the leda electromagnetic calorimeter and the plastic ball detector of the wa98 experiment . the conventional reaction plane method for directed and elliptic flow and the pair - correlation method for elliptic flow have been used in the analysis .",
    "the elliptic flow values obtained by the two methods are consistent .",
    "the centrality and @xmath1 dependences of the photon directed and elliptic flow coefficients were presented . in - plane elliptic flow is observed .",
    "both flow values increase for more peripheral collisions and with increasing @xmath1 .    for comparison with charged pion measurements ,",
    "the neutral pion flow coefficients have been extracted from the measured photon flow coefficients using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the monte carlo simulations demonstrate that the average photon flow coefficients are @xmath101721% greater than the parent @xmath20 flow coefficients .",
    "the extracted neutral pion flow results are compatible with the na49 charged pion flow and with the general trend of the elliptic flow behaviour as a function of beam energy .",
    "the universal dependence of the elliptic flow , scaled by the eccentricity of the initial nuclear overlap , on particle density is confirmed .",
