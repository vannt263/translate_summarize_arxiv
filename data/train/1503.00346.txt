    "new data by planck experiment provide more accurate information on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is known to carry crucial information on the properties in the early universe , while the temperature fluctuations in the cmb maps are basically gaussian @xcite .",
    "along with that , certain non - gaussian properties as the cold spot , the low multipole anomaly , etc @xcite have been also noticed , including in the planck data @xcite . among the important issues regarding cmb ,",
    "is the separation of point sources ( galaxies , quasars , blazars , grbs , etc ) in the data .",
    "here we study this issue in the planck data using the method of kolmogorov stochasticity parameter .",
    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) maps have been examined for the detection of point sources as potential foregrounds , which could be either cosmological or milky way objects emitting thermally or non - thermally @xcite .",
    "a corresponding catalog is made available in http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/missions/planck.html[nasa/ipac infrared science archive ] .",
    "various methods , including the wavelets and needlets , have been used for separation of point sources in pixelized sky maps ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most of the detected sources in cmb maps coincide with known radio sources , quasars , blazars , although some sources remain still unidentified @xcite .",
    "the kolmogorov stochasticity parameter ( ksp ) has been already involved for such aims @xcite using wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data : some of the sources revealed by that method initially had no counterparts , however their counterparts have been detected later by the fermi satellite as gamma sources and were included in fermi lat 1-year point source catalog @xcite . in the present study we continue the application of the ksp technique aiming to detect point sources in planck lfi 70ghz data set @xcite , and for that goal we borrow the maps cleaned by the method developed in @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we introduce briefly the kolmogorov method , then we construct cleaned k - maps using the tegmark et al .  method , modified for such maps .",
    "then we use the resulting maps to reveal the point sources and other non - gaussian structures on the cmb map .",
    "in his original work kolmogorov @xcite has introduced a method for determining whether a given random number sequence @xmath0 , ordered in an increasing way , obeys a given statistic or not @xcite .",
    "for such a purpose a so - called empirical cumulative distribution function @xmath1 is calculated , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of elements which obey to the relation @xmath4 .",
    "having assumed a particular theoretical cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) @xmath5 , the parameter @xmath6 is easily calculated , @xmath7 kolmogorov proved that in the limit @xmath8 , @xmath6 , which is a random variable , has a cumulative distribution function @xmath9 reading as @xmath10 the function @xmath9 can be expressed as a particular value of theta functions , since @xmath11 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the series of papers",
    "@xcite arnold examines the application of this statistic to determine degree of randomness of a given sequence .",
    "although this statistic was intended for i.i.d sequences , he applied this statistic to arithmetical and geometrical progressions and revealed the relative degree of randomness e.g. of arithmetical progression with respect to geometrical one .",
    "( top ) and k - maps with resolution parameters @xmath12 ( bottom ) .",
    "it can be seen a round spot on the cmb temperature map affected by inhomogeneous coverage of the sky .",
    "this spot appears on k - map as a region with unusual high value of ksp ( see fig .",
    "[ cksp ] and figs .",
    "10,15,18 of @xcite).,scaledwidth=95.0% ]",
    "it is well known that the cmb sky has basically gaussian distribution , although along with certain non - gaussian features ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "based on this empirical fact , the gaussian distribution is used in kolmogorov method to construct a k - map . in the case of planck",
    "lfi 70 ghz cmb map @xcite with resolution parameter @xmath13 , for every compact region of the cmb map containing 256 neighboring temperature pixels , one corresponding pixel value of the k - map is obtained .",
    "but for planck lfi 70 ghz cmb map with resolution parameter @xmath14 , the same procedure is done for 64 neighboring temperature pixels .",
    "therefore for both cmb temperature maps with resolution parameters @xmath15 we get k - maps with resolution parameter @xmath12 .",
    "this adds some statistical inhomogeneity in our calculations but provides more maps for tegmark et al .",
    "foreground reducing method . for both planck lfi 70 ghz cmb maps with @xmath13 and @xmath14 resolution parameters ( details in @xcite ) ,",
    "we obtain a k - map with @xmath12 parameter .",
    "this means that if the cmb map has @xmath16 pixels , then k - map has @xmath17 pixels .",
    "this is due to the fact that ksp is a statistical parameter .",
    "then the ksp distribution maps over the whole sky can be obtained for planck lfi 70 ghz data .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ maps ] that the galactic disk region has higher and saturated ksp values , which indicate that it has a non - gaussian distribution , as distinct from the cmb .",
    "also a lot of pixels have a high value of ksp , but most of them , as it will be shown below , are due to instrumental and other types of noise , also of non - gaussian nature .",
    "( top ) and regions with higher value of ksp ( @xmath18 ) . a subtle star - like shape of inhomogeneous sky coverage pixels can be seen in both foreground reduced k - map and among higher ksp values of ksp indicated as yellow dots ( see fig .",
    "5 of @xcite ) .",
    "blue dots of high ksp values indicate those non - gaussian regions that have counterpart in planck compact point source catalog .",
    "red ( pointed by arrows ) and yellow dots are those having no counterpart and regions affected by inhomogeneous sky coverage , respectively.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    throughout the analysis we mainly use the healpix program package for calculation of the spherical harmonic coefficients and to reconstruct the maps @xcite .",
    "for some tedious manipulating procedures with the spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath19 ( see eq .",
    "( [ harm ] ) below ) we use the glesp program package @xcite . for maps with low resolution ( in our case for k - map , @xmath20 )",
    "the @xmath19 calculation and map reconstruction the use of healpix program package led to accuracy problems . to test whether the calculation error is small or not for a low resolution map , we construct a unity healpix map with @xmath12 , and another one with @xmath13 , and run them through the @xmath19 calculation and the map reconstruction procedures .",
    "for both cases this procedure adds some non - isotropic noise which has almost zero mean ( @xmath21 ) and a very small standard deviation ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "although some pixels around the poles have bigger error , the fraction of these pixels on the sky for @xmath12 is less than 0.5% .",
    "so for @xmath12 , the error and standard deviation are sufficiently small , which enables one to calculate the @xmath19 and to construct the cleaned map for ksp using tegmark et al",
    ".  method .",
    "any full sky map can be represented via a series of legendre spherical functions @xmath27 @xcite , where @xmath28 as easily shown , the coefficients @xmath29 of the legendre polynomials @xmath30 in the two point correlation function @xmath31 of the power spectrum are related to the @xmath19 by @xmath32 so called cross power spectra is a common technique described in @xcite .",
    "it can calculated via taking the cross - correlation power spectrum coefficients for different type of @xmath19 , as @xmath33 tegmark et al .",
    "@xcite cmb foreground reducing method uses cross - correlation power spectrum matrix to obtain weights for every band .",
    "this method is commonly used for obtaining a cmb foreground - reduced map from the original wmap and planck ( smica composite map ) cmb maps . in this method every map from different bands is weighted with weights @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the multipole number and @xmath36 the band index .",
    "it differs from the interlinear combination ( ilc ) method of weighting different bands suggested by the wmap team @xcite by dependence of weights on the multipole numbers .",
    "we use tegmark et al .",
    "method @xcite to develop a cleaned cmb k - map from three couples of planck lfi 70 ghz maps : nominal , nominal_ringhalf1 , nominal_ringhalf2 .",
    "each element in couple of maps contains both maps with resolution parameter @xmath37 .",
    "this method , based on the power spectrum comparison , assigns a weight @xmath34 for each map @xmath36 and multipole @xmath35 . in order not to distort the original map",
    ", @xmath34 should obey the relation @xmath38 but in our case it is mandatory to preserve original k - maps mean value because kolmogorov parameter varies from zero to unity . because first harmonic coefficient @xmath39 depends only on mean value of map , we take @xmath39 of cleaned map as a mean value over original maps @xmath39 values @xmath40    ) vs. kolmogorov parameter @xmath41 outside the galactic region @xmath42 .",
    "red and blue dots are ksp high value pixels whose distance smaller and larger than @xmath43 , one pixel angular diameter of healpix map with resolution parameter @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "black cross ( @xmath44 ) over a red dot indicate k - map pixel around which too few observations are available .",
    "this pixel located over the spot is mentioned in fig .",
    "[ maps].,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    in the kolmogorov method , if a sequence of random numbers @xmath45 obeys a theoretical distribution function @xmath5 then @xmath46 realizations of this sequence gives @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "the remarkable point of the method is that , @xmath47 has a uniform distribution and the mean value @xmath49 .",
    "therefore for a cmb k - map the value @xmath50 is a natural threshold for distinguishing non - gaussian areas from others , since gaussian temperature pixels can not have @xmath51 .",
    "further , the cleaned k - map mean value and sigma are respectively @xmath52 , @xmath53 , so pixels with @xmath18 mostly exceed the 3-@xmath22 region .",
    "it is well - known that planck satellite covered the sky inhomogeneously .",
    "it can be seen in fig .  5 of @xcite that certain regions on the sky observed about thousand times but there are also sky regions that were not covered ( observed ) at all .",
    "kolmogorov parameter is a statistical parameter therefore it is sensible to such inhomogeneous coverage , too .",
    "so if a compact region of 256 temperature neighboring pixels is located on the border where number of observations ( nobs ) decrease or increase sharply , then we have high value of ksp .",
    "these nobs affected regions are colored yellow to indicate them among other regions with high value of ksp ( @xmath18 ) in fig .",
    "[ cksp ] . in contrary with these yellow colored pixels where number of observations decreases form very high values to mean value",
    ", there is another pixel of k - map around which hardly any observation was done ( coordinates on the k - map @xmath54 , @xmath55 , colored red ) .",
    "so kolmogorov parameter detects inhomogeneous coverage of the sky , too .      in fig .",
    "[ cksp ] one can see the galactic disk , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and other possible point sources .",
    "there are in total 1321 non - gaussian pixels among 196608 ( about @xmath56 ) .",
    "only 153 among them are outside the galactic disk region ( @xmath42 ) , the large magellanic cloud ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) and regions of sky affected by inhomogeneous sky coverage ( so called `` nobs '' ) .",
    "so , these 153 regions are point source candidates . indeed , most of them are found in the catalog of @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ points ] for more details ) .",
    "note that even if one takes galactic region as @xmath59 , then it would just add more 3 point sources to these 153 .",
    "hence these 153 point source candidates depend very slightly on galactic disk mask choice . among that 153",
    "point source candidates only nine possible point sources remain unidentified in any of the known catalogs .",
    "we are comparing and confirming that our possible point source candidates have counterparts in planck compact source catalog in case when angular distance between a point source is equal or less than the average angular size of healpix pixel . for a map of resolution",
    "parameter @xmath12 the healpix pixels angular size is @xmath60 . but this restriction is very strict and some cases can be when point sources have large angular size .",
    "therefore five of these unidentified point sources being close neighbors ( @xmath61 ) might be also affected by planck point sources .",
    "remaining four unidentified point source candidates have counterparts in two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) galaxy catalog .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we use the kolmogorov stochasticity parameter to probe non - gaussianity of planck lfi 70 ghz cmb maps .",
    "it is shown that for about 72% of the cleaned map , the kolmogorov function has values within the interval @xmath62 , which implies that the cmb maps are indeed gaussian with high precision .",
    "non - gaussian pixels ( with @xmath18 ) are rather rare ( @xmath63 ) , i.e. , less than 1% .",
    "although this result is true for cleaned k - map , it shows that different sources add certain non - gaussian noise into cmb map and they can be removed by foreground reducing methods .",
    "another remarkable feature of both cleaned and original k - maps is that it shows some areas of inhomogeneous coverage of the sky by planck satellite .",
    "it is obvious that some pixels in k - maps have high value of ksp due to this effect .    for searching counterparts between these non - gaussian regions and any available catalogs ,",
    "we utilize the main feature of healpix map- equal area pixels .",
    "therefore 1-pixel angular size is about @xmath43 degrees in case of resolution parameter @xmath12 .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ points ] that this assumption works very well .",
    "k - map pixels outside galactic disk region ( @xmath64 ) with ksp value @xmath18 indicate possible point sources and other non - gaussian regions . indeed",
    "143 of them have counterparts in planck compact point sources catalog of lfi 70 ghz . but nine non - gaussian regions still have no known counterpart .",
    "note that , a non - gaussianity appears around the region of cmb sky with extremly low number of observations .",
    "we are grateful to v.  gurzadyan and colleagues in center for cosmology and astrophysics for numerous comments and discussions .",
    "hg would like to express his appreciation to g. meylan , d. pfenniger and g. nurbaeva for helpful comments and support during the early stages of this study and to o.  verkhodanov for information about glesp ."
