    "dynamical measurements of the behavior of gravity in the strong - field regime will constrain the geometry of the spacetime around bhs , telling us whether the kerr solution actually describes these objects and potentially even yielding smoking guns of new physics beyond general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "there is mounting observational evidence that supermassive bhs with masses between @xmath4 and @xmath5 reside at the heart of nearly every galaxy @xcite . though mbhs are an observational certainty , nearly every aspect of their evolution  from their birth , to their fuel source , to their basic dynamics ",
    "is a matter of lively debate .",
    "the existence of bright quasars at high redshift implies that billion solar mass bhs must be in place within their host galaxies less than a billion years after the big bang .",
    "this remarkable observational fact suggests that the seeds of these most massive mbhs are sown during , or even before , the formation of protogalaxies .",
    "however , the precise mbh seed formation mechanism is not known , nor is it clear that there is only one seed formation channel at play over the entire mbh mass spectrum .",
    "currently , the two most widely accepted mbh birth scenarios are a ) the remnants of the first generation of stars ( population iii : see e.g.  @xcite ) , and b ) the direct collapse of pristine gas within massive dark matter halos  @xcite . in both these models , overdensities within a gas cloud collapse as the gas radiates away energy ; if the gas can cool efficiently , then it gravitationally fragments into ever smaller clouds . the mass of the final collapsed object , be it a protostellar cloud or a seed black hole ,",
    "is determined by the jeans mass of the gas that can no longer cool efficiently enough to fragment further .    in the population iii seed scenario ,",
    "metal - free gas is cooled by h@xmath6 and hd , but since these molecules are much less effective than metals in radiating away energy , the jeans mass is likely to be larger than that of stars formed in the present era . however , one of the difficulties in this scenario is that the actual initial mass function of this first generation of stars is hotly debated , and the issue will not easily resolve itself with the current state - of - the - art simulations .",
    "early work placed the stellar mass at @xmath7  @xcite , but later work suggested that fragmentation is far more common  @xcite . a recent study examining",
    "the role of turbulence in population iii star formation suggested a flat initial mass function with a characteristic mass less than @xmath8 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the newest work tends to indicate that , even though the protostellar clouds do fragment , they tend to quickly merge within a dynamical time , essentially generating the very massive population iii stars once again  @xcite .",
    "while these theoretical advances are promising , a more thorough treatment involving radiative transfer and 3d magnetohydrodynamics is required before we will truly understand the nature of the first stars and whether they can spawn mbh seeds .    in the fiducial direct collapse model ,",
    "the only coolant is atomic hydrogen , and this requires that the gas sit in dark matter halos with virial temperatures higher than @xmath9 k. to inhibit fragmentation and to suppress h@xmath6 formation , there is an additional photon bath that heats the gas ; one of the most likely candidates for this radiation field , the lyman - werner background , is thought to be generated by nearby population iii stars  @xcite at redshifts z @xmath10 .",
    "preventing efficient cooling and fragmentation in this way results in a huge jeans mass , and the eventual seed bhs are of order @xmath11 .",
    "these direct collapse bhs are the most obvious candidates to grow into the mbhs powering high - redshift quasars , because they require no stringent assumptions on the accretion or merger history to grow to @xmath12 by @xmath13 .    as with the population iii scenario ,",
    "the main epoch of direct collapse seed formation is brief , ending as metals pollute the halo gas and the radiation field drops below a critical heating threshold as the universe expands @xcite .",
    "still , pockets of pristine and irradiated gas could remain at low redshift that could collapse into mbh seeds  @xcite .",
    "one potential issue with this direct collapse model is that the intensity of radiation needed to prevent fragmentation is under debate , and the actual lyman - warner background generated at redshift @xmath14 is not well - constrained , as it depends in part on the occupation fraction and initial mass function of population iii stars .",
    "therefore , direct collapse bh formation may arguably be too rare to account for the quasar population , much less the entire mbh mass spectrum ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "one of the great promises of a future space - based gw observatory like elisa is that it may be able to pin down the relative efficiency of light versus mbh seed formation channels  @xcite .",
    "these pathways affect the occupation fraction of mbhs in local dwarf galaxies , the existence of intermediate - mass bhs , and the scaling relations between mbhs and their host galaxies ( i.e. the @xmath15@xmath16 relation ) at low masses .",
    "studies have attempted to predict mbh - galaxy occupation fractions @xcite and the low - mass @xmath15@xmath16 relation @xcite for a range of seed models , but observations in this regime are very difficult , and thus constraints are difficult to obtain .",
    "direct gw detections will elucidate much regarding the hidden mbh population and their seeding mechanism .    turning now to mbh growth",
    ", it is tempting to think that a clearer picture emerges .",
    "the famous soltan argument has often been invoked to claim that mbhs are fueled nearly entirely by gas during the brief quasar epoch .",
    "the logic goes like this .",
    "if we assume that quasars are powered by gas accretion onto mbhs , then we can turn the observed energy and number density of optically - bright quasars into an estimate of the gas mass accreted by mbhs during the quasar era . happily , if we compare the mass density of accreted gas during the quasar phase ( assuming a radiative efficiency of 10% ) to the mass density locked up in the local mbh population , the numbers agree .",
    "this implies that 90% of mbh masses are built from gas that is accreted at the eddington limit before redshift 2 ; it also implies that mbhs do not seem to accrete in a low - efficiency , or `` quiet '' mode , nor are there many obscured or undetected quasars within the mbh mass budget .",
    "though this argument seems pat and iron - clad , there are many uncertainties involved . for example , converting the optically observed quasar luminosity function to a bolometric energy density is fraught with difficulty .",
    "furthermore , it is very clear that optical quasar surveys do miss a large fraction of the real quasar population , those that are radio - loud or x - ray bright ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , many theoretical efforts call into question the assumption of eddington - limited accretion , some advocating super - eddington accretion along filaments to feed ultramassive bhs @xcite , and others promoting a `` radio '' mode of quiescent gas accretion @xcite . along this line , simulations indicate that the high - redshift universe may be rife with hidden mbhs that are accreting at less than the eddington rate  @xcite .    despite these uncertainties , it is widely accepted that gas is the primary fuel for mbh growth .",
    "it is thought that galaxy mergers help to restock the gas reservoir around the bh as the gas is shocked and then falls toward the galactic center .",
    "indeed one of the best explanations of the m@xmath16 relation invokes galaxy mergers that drive gas toward the bh , which fuels it and subsequently generates a prodigious radiative `` feedback '' that pushes the remaining gas toward the galaxy outskirts and cuts off the mbh fuel source ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "once the gas is in the galaxy bulge potential , it slowly cools and forms new stars with high velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "though early simulations of equal - mass galaxy mergers were very promising in supporting this view , later unequal - mass mergers fail to grow the primary mbhs enough to fall on the m-@xmath16 relation @xcite .",
    "the problem is that most low - mass mbhs , like the one in our milky way , simply do nt undergo equal - mass mergers at the rate needed to build the mbh and to couple this growth to the bulge in this framework .",
    "fear not : mergers are not the only process which may trigger mbh growth .",
    "in fact , galaxies which lack a bulge ( often thought to have extremely quiescent merger histories ) may host mbhs as well , and even actively growing ones .",
    "one thought is that mbhs may grow efficiently through the accretion of cold , unshocked gas ( i.e. `` cold flows '' ) which enter the galaxy through filamentary accretion .",
    "some galaxies acquire most of their gas through this process @xcite , and mbhs may efficiently accrete this gas as well @xcite .",
    "another method which may be prevalent consists of mergers of mbhs with other mbhs @xcite . in the simulations presented in @xcite , the central mbhs in massive galaxies at @xmath17 have built up over half of their mass through mbhb mergers .",
    "this is a regime where gw observations can verify the accuracy of these predictions , which depend on many properties of mbh seed formation ( initial mass , formation redshift , and efficiency of formation ) . by directly collecting gw data from the growth of high - redshift mbhs",
    ", we can determine if this phenomenon is dominated by mbh mergers , or whether it is correlated with galaxy merger rates , or some combination of the two .",
    "overall , it is likely that there are several mechanisms to grow a mbh , depending on the assembly history of the host galaxy .",
    "the most massive mbhs are likely fueled via gas accretion from major mergers at high redshift @xcite , which explains the relative tightness of the m@xmath16 relation in this regime .",
    "lower - mass galaxies , which experience fewer major mergers , exhibit more scatter within the local scaling relations , likely because their mbhs grow through more stochastic processes such as cold flow accretion , or through secular processes like bar - driven gas inflow . the combination of these processes plus",
    "the unknown contribution of mbhb mergers leads to a myriad of possibilities for mbh growth , which will be possible to disentangle by means of low - frequency gw observations .",
    "according to the evolution picture emerging from section [ sec : kelly - jillian ] , mbhb coalescences must be common events at all redshifts .",
    "these systems do not live in isolation , but they are embedded in dense galactic nuclei , surrounded by gas and stars .",
    "therefore , the interaction of mbhbs with their environment may provide a unique opportunity to observe em signatures as well as gws , opening new avenues in multimessenger astronomy .",
    "information from a simultaneous detection of em and gws may be useful for studying fundamental aspects of gravitational physics .",
    "for example , in some modified gravity scenarios , the propagation velocity for gravitons may differ from that of photons @xcite . additionally , the measurement of the luminosity distance from the gw signal at an accuracy of @xmath18 , coupled with the redshift information from the em detection , could serve as a cosmological `` standard siren '' of unprecedented accuracy ( better than @xmath19 ) @xcite",
    ". such detections may also combine accurate measurements of mbh spins and masses obtained from gw signals with em observations to probe mbh accretion physics in great detail @xcite .",
    "since most elisa sources will be relatively low - mass systems at high redshift , where gas - rich environments are common , we focus here on the interaction between a mbh and a putative massive circumbinary disk .",
    "the standard picture of circumbinary accretion disks can be described as follows .",
    "tidal torques from the binary tend to drive gas outward , clearing an evacuated cavity in the innermost region of the disk .",
    "meanwhile , viscous torques transport angular momentum outward in the disk , allowing gas to flow inward and refill this cavity .",
    "the balance of tidal and viscous torques determines the location of the inner edge of the circumbinary disk at @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the binary separation .",
    "this balance can be maintained , provided the timescale @xmath22 for inspiral of the binary due to gw emission is much longer than the viscous timescale of the disk , @xmath23 .",
    "this is known as the `` pre - decoupling '' epoch .    to date , a number of `` dual '' systems in which two mbhs occupy the same galaxy but are too widely separated to be gravitationally bound have been observed @xcite , as well as several candidate binary systems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . proposed",
    "em signatures of such binaries include spatially resolving two agn - like point sources , identifying double - peaked broad emission lines , spatial structures in radio jets , characteristic time variability in quasar emission , and characteristic features in quasar spectra .",
    "theoretical aspects of this problem have been studied analytically @xcite , often using approximate angle - averaged tidal torque formulae .",
    "while these techniques have proven very useful in highlighting qualitative features of the accretion , they tend to overestimate the barrier to accretion imposed by binary torques by imposing symmetry in the accretion flow . as em counterparts to mbh mergers depend sensitively on the amount of gas available for accretion , it is important to understand non - axisymmetric effects which may provide a mechanism for delivering more gas to the mbhs .",
    "indeed , 2d and 3d simulations have demonstrated that gas streams may be stripped from the inner cavity , accreting directly onto the binary .",
    "prior numerical simulations have been performed in 2d @xcite and in 3d @xcite . while 3d codes have been useful in probing the gas dynamics during the final orbits prior to mbh merger , long viscous timescales",
    "render them prohibitively costly for simulating the quasi - steady - state flow during the `` pre - decoupling '' epoch . for this epoch ,",
    "2d simulations such as those performed using the _ disco _ code @xcite have proven quite useful .",
    "these simulations include the inner cavity in the computational domain , and use shock - capturing godunov - type methods to evolve thin ( @xmath24 ) disks over the viscous timescales necessary to accurately capture the steady - state accretion at high resolution .",
    "the _ disco _ code is a moving - mesh code which allows one the freedom to specify the motion of the computational cells @xcite . for binary accretion",
    ", the chosen rotation profile matches the nearly keplerian fluid motion outside the cavity , while transitioning to uniform rotation at the binary orbital frequency inside the cavity . because grid cells move azimuthally with the fluid , advection errors are minimized , allowing for the accurate capture of the dynamics of accretion streams which penetrate into the cavity .    the quasi - steady - state solutions which the simulations relax to after several viscous timescales can be interpreted as generalizations of the shakura - sunyaev disk solutions @xcite , with the central gravitating object replaced by a binary .",
    "the initial disk configurations consist of the `` middle region '' shakura - sunyaev solution for a steady - state , geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk , assuming a gas - pressure dominated fluid with electron scattering as the dominant opacity .",
    "the fluid evolves according the the 2d viscous navier - stokes equations , assuming an @xmath25-law viscosity prescription .",
    "a @xmath26-law equation of state of the form @xmath27 is chosen , where @xmath28 is the internal energy density , and the adiabatic index is set to @xmath29 .",
    "appropriate radiative cooling and viscous heating terms are added to the energy equation .",
    "the cooling rate for an optically thick , geometrically thin disk is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mid - plane temperature , and @xmath32 is the optical depth for electron scattering ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "it is assumed that the fluid is gas - pressure dominated everywhere , ignoring radiation pressure . in each simulation",
    "the binary is chosen to have zero eccentricity .",
    "the important findings of these simulations are the following :    1 .   as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : farris_density ] , gas enters the circumbinary cavity along accretion streams , and the interaction of these streams with the cavity wall causes the cavity to become lopsided ( in agreement with e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for a description of the mechanism driving the growth of this lopsidedness .",
    "+ snapshot of surface density @xmath34 during quasi - steady state after @xmath35 .",
    "surface density is normalized by the maximum value at @xmath36 and plotted on a logarithmic scale in the inner @xmath37 .",
    "orbital motion is in the counter - clockwise direction . ]",
    "these simulations support the growing consensus that the accretion rate onto the mbhs is not significantly reduced by the presence of a binary , when compared to the accretion rate onto a single mbh of the same mass @xcite .",
    "this is the case in spite of the fact that much of the inner cavity is cleared of gas by the action of the binary torques , and it is due to the effectiveness of the narrow accretion stream in delivering gas from the circumbinary disk inner edge to the individual black holes .",
    "3 .   for each mass ratio",
    "considered , `` mini - disks '' surrounding each mbh are formed . in each case , the mini - disks are persistent , as their accretion timescale greatly exceeds the binary orbital timescale . for the binary mass ratios @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the size of these mini - disks is in rough agreement with the semi - analytic predictions of @xcite .",
    "significant periodicity in the accretion rates emerges for @xmath40 . at these mass ratios ,",
    "the binary torques are strong enough to excite eccentricity in the inner cavity and create an overdense lump , whose interaction with the passing mbhs leads to periodicity in the accretion rate .",
    "the strongest peak in the periodograms for these cases corresponds to the orbital frequency of the lump , with many associated harmonics for the @xmath41 cases .",
    "this periodicity may constitute a unique observational signature of mbhbs .",
    "5 .   for each case",
    "considered , the accretion rate onto the secondary is sufficiently large relative to that of the primary , so that the mass ratio @xmath42 is increasing .",
    "similar results have been found previously in sph calculations @xcite .",
    "as mbhs are expected to gain a significant fraction of their mass through gas accretion @xcite , this suggests a mechanism which may bias the distribution of binaries near merger toward higher mass ratios . 6 .",
    "the emission associated with the shock heating in the accretion streams is sufficient to bring the emission from within the cavity above that of a disk around a single mbh .",
    "the peak in @xmath43 which appears at @xmath44 corresponds to the shock heating of gas in the stream which is not directly accreted , but rather impacts the cavity wall as seen along the lower - right edge of the cavity in fig .",
    "[ fig : farris_density ] , leading to the thin strip of bright emission . scaled to a @xmath45 binary with a separation near decoupling at @xmath46 , this enhancement is significant in soft and hard x - rays ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : farris_spectrum ] ) .",
    "this x - ray enhancement has been predicted by @xcite , who estimated the characteristic frequency of mini - disk `` hot spot '' emission by estimating the amount of energy released due to shock heating when accretion streams impact the minidisks .",
    "instruments sensitive to x - ray emission from agn such as xmm - newton , nustar , the upcoming erosita all - sky survey , and the proposed athena x - ray observatory may be sensitive to these signatures .",
    "thermal spectra computed from simulation snapshot at @xmath35 .",
    "red curves are calculated from disk data @xmath47 after that of black curves .",
    "the full spectrum is represented by solid lines , the component arising only from minidisk regions within distance @xmath48 of either mbh is represented by dashed lines , the `` cavity '' emission is represented by dotted lines , and the emission from the `` outer region '' is represented by dashed - dotted lines .",
    "we have introduced the scaling parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . ]",
    "while there remain no confirmed observations of em counterparts for mbhbs , simulations have already provided tantalizing evidence that significant gas can accrete onto such a binary , even at separations in the elisa band .",
    "a number of distinguishing observational signatures of such systems have been proposed , including directly resolving two agn - like point sources , searching for offset emission lines , spatial structures in radio jets , characteristic time variability in quasar emission , and characteristic features in quasar spectra .",
    "as we enter the age of gw astronomy the possibility of a simultaneous measurement of both gravitational and em radiation from a merging mbhb appears increasingly likely .",
    "in gr , mbhs are described by the kerr metric and are completely characterized by three `` charges '' ( or `` hairs '' ) , the mass @xmath15 , the spin @xmath52 and an electric charge @xmath53 , with the spin satisfying the kerr bound @xmath54 ( if the spin is larger than this bound , the kerr metric does not describe a bh but a naked singularity ) . also , the charge @xmath53 is usually expected to be negligible for astrophysical bhs , due to the presence of plasma that quickly neutralizes it , and also because of quantum effects such as schwinger pair production or vacuum breakdown mechanisms producing cascades of electron - positron pairs near the bh horizon .",
    "bhs in gravity theories different from gr are still characterized by the mass and spin , but may also present additional charges that might provide a way to test gravity in strong - field regimes ( cf .  section [ sec : emanuele ] for a related discussion ) .",
    "the effect of the mass in gr is qualitatively similar to newtonian gravity , i.e. it sources an attractive force decaying as @xmath55 for @xmath56 ( @xmath57 being the distance from the bh ) . because of the long - range character of the force it sources , the mass can be estimated rather easily with em observations , e.g. ( in the case of mbhs ) by observations of the nuclear dynamics of stars and gas , fitting of the spectral energy distribution of galaxies , spectroscopic single epoch measurements and reverberation mapping .",
    "em measurements of mbh masses are typically accurate only within @xmath58 ( e.g. even for our own sgra@xmath59 , the mass can only be estimated to within @xmath60% ) , but still allowed discovering correlations with galactic properties , hinting at a symbiotic co - evolution of mbhs with their galactic hosts  @xcite .",
    "measuring bh spins is more complicated , because they do not enter the dynamics at newtonian order , but only at 1.5 post - newtonian order , i.e.  they change the newtonian equations of motion only by corrections @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the characteristic velocity of the gas and/or stars surrounding the mbh .",
    "this results in significant effects only very close to the event horizon .",
    "the most promising em technique to estimate the spins of mbhs is through the spectra of relativistically broadened k@xmath25 iron lines ( cf .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews on this topic ) .",
    "indeed , x - ray observatories such as xmm - newton and suzaku have by now measured significant samples of spins , and more constraints are becoming available from nustar s hard x - ray data  @xcite . the masses and spins of mbhs in binary systems will be measured very accurately by elisa , with errors @xmath63 and @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "these gw measurements are very clean compared to em ones , because they are not affected by the systematics usually present in em data ( which are due to poor understanding of the dissipative gas physics ) .",
    "this is because gws are emitted in the latest stages of a binary system s evolution , when the effect of the gas on the orbital dynamics is typically negligible  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , elisa will detect gws from mbhbs both during the long post - newtonian inspiral , which radiates in the elisa band for separations less than about 200 gravitational radii for binaries with total mass @xmath65 ( i.e. those to which elisa is most sensitive ) , and during the final plunge , merger and ringdown of the system .",
    "this will allow testing a plethora of strong - field general - relativistic effects , namely :    1 .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling ( also known as `` frame dragging '' )  @xcite , which causes the bh spins to precess during the inspiral , thus producing amplitude modulations in the emitted gravitational waveforms  @xcite , which increase the signal - to - noise ratio and improve the estimation of the source parameters ( and in particular the sky localization ) .",
    "the precessional dynamics can be very rich : for example , to a first approximation ( and on short timescales ) the spins precess around the binary s total angular momentum , but in certain configurations they can undergo a more complicated `` transitional precession ''  @xcite ( whereby spins almost anti - aligned with the orbital angular momentum change their orientation on a very short timescale at some point during the inspiral ) , or get locked in secularly stable resonant configurations that tend to align or anti - align the spins  @xcite ; 2 .",
    "the spin - spin coupling  @xcite , which appears at higher post - newtonian order than the spin - orbit coupling and thus modifies the spin precession in the later inspiral , causing additional modulations in the gravitational waveforms and improving parameter estimation ; 3 .",
    "the non - linear relations between the final mass , spin and recoil velocity of the bh remnant forming from the merger , and the masses and spin vectors of the binary s components at large separations .",
    "these relations have been studied in detail with fully general - relativistic numerical simulations ( see e.g.  @xcite for reviews on this topic ) , whose results can be extrapolated to generic binary configurations by exploiting knowledge of the test - particle , self - force and post - newtonian dynamics  @xcite ; 4 .",
    "the quasi - normal mode ringing of the bh remnant ( see  @xcite for a review ) , whose frequencies and decay times are functions of the remnant s mass and spin alone if gr is correct . measuring these frequencies",
    "therefore constitutes a genuine strong - field test of the gravity theory ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : emanuele ] ) .    besides testing the strong - field general - relativistic dynamics through these effects , elisa measurements of the spins",
    "will also provide useful information on the cosmological evolution of mbhs .",
    "in fact , although the impact of gas on the dynamics of mbhbs is negligible once they enter the elisa band  @xcite , radiatively efficient accretion of gas is known to be the main driver of the evolution of the masses and spins on cosmological timescales  @xcite .",
    "also , because elisa will detect gws from mbhbs at redshift @xmath1 , mass and spin measurements will give precious information about the high - redshift formation of the first generation of bh seeds , from which present - day mbhs are believed to descend .",
    "early studies  @xcite in this direction highlighted for instance that elisa mass measurements will be able to discriminate with high confidence between a scenario in which mbhs evolve from `` heavy '' ( @xmath66 ) seeds forming at @xmath67 from the collapse of protogalactic disks , and a `` light - seed '' scenario in which the seeds form at @xmath14 from the collapse of population iii stars into bhs with masses @xmath68 , shedding light on the nature of the first seed bhs forming in the young universe ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : kelly - jillian ] ) . as for the spin evolution ,  @xcite",
    "( see also  @xcite ) showed that elisa should be able to tell a coherent accretion scenario ( where gas accretion always happens on prograde orbits on the equatorial plane ) from a chaotic scenario ( where the mbh captures clouds that are isotropically distributed around it with randomly oriented angular momenta ) .",
    "clearly , the first scenario predicts almost extremal spins ( because accretion is always prograde ) , while the second predicts small spins @xmath69 , because the angular momentum transferred by the clouds tends to cancel out on long timescales .",
    "two ingredients were missing from these early attempts , namely _ ( a ) _ the strong - field spin - orbit coupling reviewed above , and _ ( b ) _ a more realistic connection between the properties of the accretion flow and those of the host galaxy . regarding _ ( a ) _ ,  @xcite showed that the interaction between the spin - orbit coupling and the viscous stresses active inside an off - equatorial , geometrically thin accretion disk results in a quick alignment between the mbh spin @xmath70 and the disk s orbital angular momentum @xmath71 ( a phenomenon known as `` bardeen - petterson effect '' ) , provided that @xmath72 .",
    "because this alignment takes place on a timescale much shorter than the accretion timescale , accretion will be essentially coherent if a mbh is hosted in a gas - rich galactic nucleus ( where it is more likely that the condition @xmath72 will be satisfied ) , while in gas - poor nuclei accretion will be more likely to resemble the chaotic accretion scenario outlined above .",
    "the bardeen - petterson effect is also expected to be important for the orientation of the spins of the merging binaries detectable with elisa .",
    "indeed , binaries forming in gas - rich nuclei will likely have almost aligned spins , and thus produce lower recoil velocities for the merger remnant , which is therefore unlikely to escape from the host galaxy  @xcite .",

    "@xcite left @xmath73 as a free parameter , because a first - principle calculation would be extremely challenging : galaxy formation simulations are not yet capable of resolving the mbh s sphere of influence and the accretion disk , and in any case it is far from clear whether such simulations have full control of the subgrid / dissipative physics at small scales ( see however  @xcite for a recent attempt to extract the angular momentum of the clouds from a hydrodynamical simulation , with resolution up to @xmath75 pc . ) alternatively , a bold attempt can be made at trying to connect @xmath73 to measurements of the velocity dispersion @xmath76 of the gas and stars in galaxies ( e.g.  if @xmath76 were zero , it is clear that accretion would be perfectly isotropic , i.e. @xmath77 ) . ref .",
    "@xcite adopted this approach and used the semi - analytical galaxy formation model of  @xcite with the spin - evolution model of  @xcite , connecting @xmath73 to measurements of @xmath76 of the gas and stellar components in various galaxy morphologies . while still debatable because these measurements are currently only available at distances of @xmath78 pc from the mbh ( and thus far from the accretion disk and the mbh s sphere of influence ) , this approach allowed the authors of  @xcite to produce testable predictions for the spin distribution in competing models for the `` isotropy '' @xmath73 of the accretion flow . in particular , three models were considered : @xmath79 one connecting @xmath73 to the velocity dispersion of the gaseous component of galaxies ; @xmath80 one connecting @xmath73 to the velocity dispersion of the stellar component ; and @xmath81 a hybrid model .",
    "a comparison with existing iron - k@xmath25 measurements of mbh spins shows that model @xmath79 is ruled out quite convincingly , while both models @xmath80 and @xmath81 are in agreement with observations ( with marginally significant evidence in favor of the hybrid model @xmath81 ) .",

    "the geometry , large - scale structure and dynamics of the universe can be inferred with precision if we can accurately measure the distance and redshift to sources distributed throughout the universe .",
    "this is because the luminosity distance @xmath82 to a source as a function of its redshift @xmath83 depends on the geometry of the universe and a number of cosmological parameters , such as the hubble parameter , relative fractions of density in dark energy , dark matter , baryonic matter , etcetera  @xcite .",

    "we will briefly review the basic idea , challenges posed by observations and some solutions .",
    "the current perspective on the problem is that elisa s application for cosmography will be limited by weak gravitational lensing , and precision measurements of cosmological parameters are only possible if elisa observes several tens of sources during its lifetime . in this",
    "regard , ground - based detectors are likely to be more useful for cosmology as they are expected to observe a very large number of sources , which helps to mitigate problems posed by weak lensing @xcite .",
    "inspiralling compact binaries are often referred to as self - calibrating standard sirens @xcite . the word `` siren '' is used to indicate that gws are more akin to sound waves than em waves , and elisa is a detector that `` listens '' to its sources .",

    "it is necessary to disentangle all the other parameters .",
    "the shape of a signal that spends a sufficiently long time ( say several months ) in the elisa band depends quite sensitively on its intrinsic parameters ( masses , spins and eccentricity ) , and the motion of elisa with respect to the source induces amplitude and phase modulations in the signal that depend on the position of the source and the orientation of its orbital angular momentum . by fitting the data with precomputed templates that depend on the different parameters of the signal one can resolve all the source parameters .",
    "significant correlations between the luminosity distance and other parameters ( most notably the orbital inclination ) corrupt the accuracy with which we can estimate the distance .",
    "even so , due to the large signal - to - noise ratios expected from supermassive bh binaries , elisa should be able to measure distances at @xmath91 to better than 0.1%-1% accuracy @xcite .",
    "schutz also pointed out that although gw observations can measure distances , they are not able to measure the source redshift .",
    "recent work , however , has shown that at least in the case of binary neutron stars , and quite possibly also for neutron star - bh binaries , it should be possible to also measure the source s redshift from the effect of tides on the waveform phasing @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic mass @xmath92 of the neutron star will be imprinted in the tidal effects , and once the intrinsic mass is known the redshift can be inferred from the fact that the observed mass @xmath93 is given by @xmath94    for mbhbs , however , there is no way to infer the source s redshift from gw observations alone .",
    "since elisa will not be sensitive to merging neutron star binaries ( at least not at cosmological distances ) , we have to rely on em follow - up of gw events to infer the source s redshift .",

    "what constitutes a `` valid opponent '' is a matter of taste . for our purpose ( i.e. , tests of strong - field gravity with bh mergers )",

    "since we do nt have a full theory of quantum gravity , an effective field - theory approach is often invoked when constructing phenomenological alternatives to gr @xcite . for example , one can start with the most generic four - dimensional theories of gravity including quadratic curvature invariants generically coupled to a single scalar field @xmath109 : @xmath110\\nn\\\\ & + s_\\text{\\rm mat}\\left[\\gamma(\\phi)g_{\\mu\\nu},\\,\\psi_\\text{\\rm mat}\\right]\\,,\\label{action_quadratic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 collectively denotes matter fields , @xmath112 is the scalar self - potential , @xmath113 are generic coupling functions , the chern - simons term @xmath114 , @xmath115 is the levi - civita tensor , and in the matter action @xmath116 we allow for a nonminimal coupling that violates the ( weak ) equivalence principle .",

    "the action above may seem complicated , but it actually represents a very restricted class of theories , and calculations of gravitational radiation have been performed only in very specific subcases , such as scalar - tensor theories with specific choices of the potential and couplings @xcite and some forms of quadratic gravity @xcite .",

    "astronomers commonly believe that the compact objects that harbor galactic centers are the bhs of gr , but this `` bh paradigm '' rests on somewhat shaky foundations .",
    "evidence that these objects possess event horizons ( or more correctly , apparent horizons ) rather than solid surfaces usually rests on plausibility arguments based on accretion physics @xcite , that leave room for some skepticism .",
    "it is also important to stress that , strictly speaking , any tests that probe the kerr _",
    "alone ( such as tests based on matter accretion or ray - tracing of photon trajectories ) are of little value as internal tests of gr .",
    "the reason is that most alternative theories ( including generic scalar - tensor theories @xcite and a large class of higher - curvature theories @xcite ) admit the kerr metric as a solution , and the theories that do nt ( e.g. einstein - dilaton gauss - bonnet @xcite , dynamical chern - simons @xcite , and lorentz - violating gravity  @xcite ) predict bh solutions that differ from gr by amounts that should be astrophysically unmeasurable ( see , however , refs .",
    "@xcite for a family of bh solutions whose deviations from the kerr metric may be important ) .",
    "many `` quasi - kerr metrics '' that have been proposed in this context should be viewed as unnatural strawmen : they often have serious pathologies @xcite , and they are therefore unacceptable even for the limited scope of parametrizing deviations from the kerr metric @xcite .",
    "these considerations imply that the only way to unambiguously verify that the compact objects in galactic centers are actually kerr bhs is * via their gw dynamics * , especially in the strong - field merger / ringdown phase @xcite .",
    "this is why space - based gw observations hold great promise to constrain strong - field gravity @xcite . their qualitative advantage over earth - based detectors is simple to understand .",
    "the fundamental oscillation mode of a nonrotating bh has frequency @xmath117  hz .",
    "this frequency lies exactly in the `` bucket '' of elisa s noise power spectral density for `` light '' bhs of mass @xmath118 , that were presumably the building blocks of the large bhs we see at galactic centers today .",
    "advanced ligo , by contrast , has maximum sensitivity at @xmath119  hz , i.e. for intermediate - mass bhs of mass @xmath120 , whose very existence is still highly uncertain @xcite .",

    "the no - hair theorem stated in section [ sec : enrico ] implies that , in gr , the frequencies and damping times of all qnms depend only on the bh mass @xmath15 and spin @xmath21 .",
    "a measurement of the dominant mode s frequency and damping time yields both @xmath15 and @xmath21 ; the measurement of _ any _ other frequency and/or damping time can then be used to verify that the bh formed as a result of the merger is indeed a kerr bh , as predicted by gr .",
    "the feasibility of this ( internal ) test of gr depends on the measurability of qnm frequencies / damping times and on our ability to resolve modes . both measurability and resolvability scale like @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the signal - to - noise ratio of the merger event @xcite .",
    "the maximum sensitivity @xmath123 of earth - based and space - based detectors is comparable in order of magnitude , but ( as we saw above ) space - based detectors target sources that are @xmath124 times more massive .",
    "the gw amplitude @xmath125 , where @xmath126 @xcite is a `` ringdown efficiency '' and @xmath127 $ ] is the so - called symmetric mass ratio .",
    "the punchline of this argument is that @xmath128 , so _ no - hair theorem tests with space - based observations of bh binary mergers are typically @xmath129 stronger than earth - based gw tests_.    in summary , bh mergers are extraordinary ( local ) probes of the no - hair theorem that are potentially detectable by elisa throughout the entire universe .",
    "each merger event allows us to do much more than this : it can give us tests of consistency of the post - merger kerr remnant with the pre - merger binary dynamics @xcite , allow us to test the area theorem @xcite , and perhaps even allow us to peer into the nonlinear dynamics responsible for the coupling of different quasinormal modes @xcite .",
    "even more interestingly , each bh binary merger can be thought of as a local probe of whether _ strong - field _ gr is valid _ at the redshift @xmath83 at which the merger occurred_. this is an incredible opportunity for tests of gr , because it would verify that einstein s gravity accurately describes bhs at least out to redshift @xmath83 .",
    "this would place even more stringent constraints on the viable modifications of gr .",
    "this idea has one drawback :",
    "it requires ( ideally ) the determination of the merging binary s redshift @xmath83 , or at the very least the determination of a _ lower bound _ on the source redshift . as described in section [ sec : sathya ] , source localization and distance determination are intimately related in a lisa - like mission , and they get significantly better for a three - arm mission @xcite . in conclusion , a three - arm mission would make a big difference to test the no - hair theorem at cosmological redshift - and thus to place tight constraints on the strong - field behavior of the theory at distances where cosmological observations are relevant .",
    "another aspect worth emphasizing is that , unlike solar system tests ( that only probe the `` static '' , quasi - newtonian behavior of gravitational fields ) and binary pulsars ( that essentially measure the energy flux predicted by a given theory of gravity , and not much else in terms of the dynamics of the gravitational field ) the _ direct _ observation of gws can probe the number of polarization states as well as the propagation properties of gws , as encoded in their dispersion relation . tests of the dispersion relation place constraints on a putative nonzero graviton mass , and they get better , as expected , for sources at cosmological distance . in fact it has been shown that elisa can constrain the mass of the graviton to a level that is @xmath104 orders of magnitude better than current solar system constraints @xcite .",
    "quite naturally , constraints on any given alternative theory of gravity get better with multiple observations because of the improved statistics .",
    "calculations in the case of a hypothetical massive graviton show that the improvement is better than the naive poisson - statistic expectation of @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the number of events , because the louder events `` carry more weight '' in determining the combined bound @xcite .",
    "last but not least , the discovery space of elisa is potentially enormous .",
    "the potential of elisa for cosmology was discussed in section  [ sec : sathya ] ; here we will focus on the discovery space related to mbh observations .",
    "binary pulsars are already constraining phenomena like `` spontaneous scalarization '' to levels that are comparable to what elisa could do by observing neutron stars spiraling into mbhs @xcite .",
    "however , one can imagine scenarios where modified gravity would produce smoking - gun signatures of deviations from gr that would be observable by elisa , and completely invisible to binary - pulsar tests .",
    "the simplest case study are extreme mass - ratio inspirals in scalar - tensor theory .",
    "if the scalar has a mass , kerr bhs become vulnerable to the so - called `` black - hole bomb '' instability : superradiance can amplify incident waves , the mass of the scalar acts like a mirror that reflects amplified waves back onto the bh , and therefore the superresonant amplification of incident waves can grow without bound @xcite .",
    "this instability could have striking effects , such as the existence of `` floating orbits '' @xcite at which the inspiralling body could stall , emitting essentially monochromatic radiation  a `` gw laser '' !",
    "similar effects could occur if the energy conditions are violated @xcite , so elisa could hint at exotic physics responsible for possible violations of the energy conditions .",
    "finally , if the objects at galactic centers were not bhs but ( say ) gravastars or boson stars , the oscillation modes of these exotic objects would inevitably be excited by orbiting bodies , leaving characteristic signatures in the energy flux that are potentially detectable by elisa @xcite .    opening new observational windows on",
