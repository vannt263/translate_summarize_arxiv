    "the standard economics textbooks make the supply - demand law as one of the pillars of the modern economic theory",
    ". however , many people , especially economists ( see for example @xcite ) , gradually realize that the most important factor is missing in the traditional supply - demand law .",
    "the study of complex systems  @xcite has already led to novel approaches to market phenomena . in a previous work  @xcite",
    ", one of us introduced a simple framework to treat both quality and information capability , yielding a generalized supply demand law .",
    "however , in the previous paper , product is simply characterized by a single scalar variable : quality . in the modern economy",
    "we face a much more complex world , where products have many attributes and consumers have heterogeneous tastes  @xcite .",
    "these preferences can not be simply represented as price and quality alone .",
    "we therefore generalize the previous work to allow multiple variants of each product as well as many different tastes among consumers .",
    "thus the producers face a dilemma : whether to target the average taste by producing a single or a few variants to leverage the economy of scale , or to match precisely each consumer s taste  @xcite .",
    "we shall see that the answer depends on the information level that the producers may access : whether they know , and how well they know the consumers preferences .",
    "in addition , producers face also the nonlinear production costs .",
    "all these factors have to compromise to yield a combined result that gives various degrees of product diversity . with our approach ,",
    "the supply demand problem of producers with the capability of producing variations and consumers diverse tastes becomes a matching problem  @xcite , where many mathematical and statistical mechanic tools are available to handle the complexity of the combinatorial problem .",
    "in this paper we build a market model and investigate its behavior under various circumstances . in the first part of the paper we do not consider correlations between preferences of the parties included in the system . while unrealistic , this assumption allows us to discover basic properties of the model and outline the way of reasoning which can be used also in later , more realistic considerations . in the second part of the paper",
    "we discuss correlations and the ways how they can be introduced to the system .",
    "the last part of the paper deals with the consequences of the correlations for the model .",
    "let s start with a market where only one vendor and @xmath0 buyers are present .",
    "the vendor can produce @xmath1 different variants of a product ( e.g. many different shoes ) .",
    "with regard to the market , he has to decide which variants it is optimal to produce .",
    "we assume that all buyers satisfied with the offer buy one item , others stay out of the trading .",
    "buyers in the market we label with lowercase latin letters ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the different variants the vendor can produce we label with greek letters ( @xmath3 ) . the price of variant @xmath4 we label as @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that every variant can be produced in as many pieces as it is needed and as fast as it is needed .",
    "the simple structure sketched above offers us enough space to model basic features of real markets . to establish a  mathematical model for the market we have to introduce some assumptions about participants preferences and their consequences on the trading process . to keep complexity of the model at minimum we assume that buyer s opinion about a variant can by represented by one scalar quantity , which we call _ cost _ and label it with @xmath6 ; we assume @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "the smaller is the cost @xmath8 , the bigger is the probability that buyer @xmath9 is satisfied with variant @xmath4 when asked .",
    "preferences of the vendor are easier to introduce ; they are represented by costs which he suffers during production and sale of a particular variant .",
    "the cost for variant @xmath4 we label @xmath10 and after a proper rescaling of monetary units @xmath11 $ ] . to simplify our considerations",
    ", we arrange the variants in order of cost : @xmath12 .",
    "we stress a conceptual difference between vendor s and buyer s costs .",
    "the seller s cost @xmath10 is strictly monetary ",
    "it represents a real amount of money ( although in arbitrary units ) .",
    "in contrast , the buyer s cost @xmath8 has no tangible interpretation , it simply represents something as airy as happiness with the given variant .",
    "the vendor is able to produce @xmath1 different variants .",
    "however , when he is producing more variants , his expenses grows due to need of an additional investment .",
    "the vendor s tendency to produce only few different variants can be modeled e. g. by a nonlinearity of expenses ( doubled production of one single variant does not require doubled expenses ) .",
    "we adopt another approach ; we assume that to initiate the production of a variant , the vendor has to pay additional charge @xmath13 ( this represents initial costs ) .",
    "now let s assume that the vendor offered @xmath14 most favorable variants ( thus @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) to customers and the number of units sold of variant @xmath4 is @xmath17 .",
    "the total vendor s profit is @xmath18 here the last term @xmath19 comes for the initial costs of @xmath14 produced variants , @xmath20 is the profit for one sold unit of variant @xmath4 . due to the monetary rescaling used to confine @xmath10 to the range @xmath21 $ ] , units for profit , initial costs and prices are arbitrary .",
    "it is natural to assume that when buyer @xmath9 is asked about interest to buy variant @xmath4 , the decision is based on the cost @xmath8 .",
    "we formalize this by the assumption that the probability of acceptance is a function of the variant cost ; this function we call acceptance function .",
    "obviously , @xmath22 is a decreasing function of the cost @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , we assume @xmath23 .",
    "this means that if a buyer considers a variant to be the perfect one , she surely buys it .",
    "when we offer a random variant to one buyer , the acceptance probability is @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the probability distribution of cost @xmath6 ( i.e.  it defines what `` to offer a random variant '' really means ) .",
    "the probability @xmath26 of accepting a random proposal is an important parameter of the model . from our everyday life",
    "we know that largely we do not agree to such an offer .",
    "for this reason we assume @xmath27 in our calculations .",
    "one example of a reasonable choice for the acceptance function is ( see fig .  [ fig - fx ] ) @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "this choice is especially convenient due to its simplicity .",
    "if we now assume the uniform distribution of the buyer s costs , @xmath30 for @xmath31 , parameter @xmath26 of the acceptance function ( [ acceptance - function ] ) is just the probability @xmath26 of accepting a random offer introduced in the previous paragraph .    .",
    "]    in the rest of this paper we assume that the prices of all variants are the same and equal to @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "this relieves us from many technicalities , and helps to highlight important features of the model .",
    "nevertheless , generalization to various prices is straightforward .",
    "we begin our investigation with the simplest case of the presented model ",
    "the market without correlations , where all costs @xmath10 and @xmath8 are mutually independent .",
    "we model this by costs uniformly distributed in the range @xmath21 $ ] . to keep variants ordered ,",
    "we first draw their costs and then we renumber all variants achieve @xmath12 .",
    "it follows that after averaging over realizations , the formula @xmath34 holds .      if a vendor wants to discover which variants are most acceptable for buyers , in a market without correlations each buyer has to be asked for preferences",
    "this can not be done in big markets , thus it is natural to investigate the case with no information about buyers preferences on the vendor s side . in sec .",
    "[ sec - informed ] we show that even an expensive global opinion survey brings only a negligible contribution to the vendor s income .    without any information about preferences ,",
    "the vendor is not able to discover which variants are most favored by buyers . therefore the best strategy is to offer variants that are most favorable from his point of view .",
    "let s label the number of variants the vendor is willing to offer as @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that all these variants are available to buyers simultaneously , similarly to different types of shoes available in a shoe shop .",
    "every buyer goes through the offered variants and decides whether some of them are suitable or not .    from the buyer",
    "s point of view , the vendor makes random proposals ; the probability of accepting one particular offer is thus by definition equal to @xmath26 .",
    "the probability @xmath35 that one particular buyer accepts one of @xmath14 proposed variants is complementary to the probability @xmath36 of denying all offered variants .",
    "thus we have @xmath37 where the approximation used is valid for @xmath38 , i.e. for very choosy consumers ( than @xmath26 is a small quantity ) and a small number of offered variants . now",
    "the average number of items sold by the vendor to all @xmath0 buyers is @xmath39 . since no correlations are present , the average number of items sold of variant @xmath4 is @xmath40 , it is a decreasing function of @xmath14 .",
    "the quantity of vendor s interest is the total profit @xmath41 introduced in ( [ vendors - profit ] ) .",
    "its expected value can be found using @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath35 .",
    "we obtain @xmath44 here the subscript @xmath45 reminds that we are dealing with an `` uninformed '' vendor .",
    "this function is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig - profit ] for three different choices of initial cost @xmath46 .",
    "the optimal number of variants the vendor should offer maximizes his profit .",
    "one can easily show that when @xmath47 , @xmath48 for all @xmath49 .",
    "thus the condition @xmath47 , which can be rewritten as @xmath50 , characterizes a market where the optimal vendor s strategy is to stop the production and stay idle .",
    ", drawn against @xmath14 for small value of initial costs ( solid line ) , medium initial costs ( dashed line ) and high initial costs ( dotted line ) . in the last case the condition @xmath50 is fulfilled and the optimal vendor s strategy is to stop the production . ]    since for every product numerous numerous variations can be made , the total number of variants the vendor can offer , @xmath1 , is large .",
    "thus we are allowed to assume that the optimal number of offered variants satisfies the condition @xmath51 and solve the maximization condition @xmath52 approximately .",
    "we obtain @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the optimal expected profit , @xmath55 .",
    "the used approximations are valid when @xmath56 and @xmath27 .     for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",

    "[ fig - kopt ] , these results are shown to match a numerical treatment of the problem . in the figure",
    "we see how the initial cost @xmath46 influences diversity of the vendor s production : decreasing @xmath46 increases differentiation of the vendor s supply in full agreement with expectations .",
    "we can examine this feature in detail if we plot the optimal number of offered variants against @xmath46 for one particular realization of the model as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - differentiation ] ( thickness of the lines is proportional to the number of buyers of a variant ) .    :",

    "vertical axis has no significant meaning , it serves purely to distinguish different variants .",
    "]      so far we dealt with a very passive approach of the vendor . while offering @xmath14 variants to the market , he had no influence on the sale .",
    "in consequence , due to the absence of correlations in the system , every offered variant had the same average number of items sold . in a big market",
    "this is a natural approach . while the use of advertising can promote some variants , its treatment exceeds our scope .    in a small market",
    "a personal offering is possible .",
    "the vendor can promote favorable variants to increase the profit simply by offering the most favorable variant first .",
    "if a buyer is not interested , the second most favorable variant follows , etc .",
    "the average sale of the first variant is @xmath60 , for the second variant it is @xmath61 and in general we have @xmath62 .",
    "hence the expected total sale is @xmath63.\\ ] ] this is equal to the expected total sale @xmath39 of the uninformed vendor in the previous section .",
    "we can conclude that the vendor s profit improvement ( if any ) does not come from an increased total sale but rather from an increased sale of the variants that are more profitable for the vendor .",
    "now we investigate the optimal number of variants to offer in this case , @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath65 decreases with @xmath4 , at some moment it is not profitable to offer one more variant and the vendor s profit is maximized .",
    "the corresponding equation @xmath66 can be solved with respect to @xmath4 , leading to @xmath64 . when the total number of possible variants @xmath1 is big , @xmath67 and the term @xmath68 can be neglected .",
    "the approximate solution is then @xmath69 this optimal number of variants to offer is smaller than @xmath70 given by eq .",
    "( [ noinfo - opt ] ) . we can also notice that when @xmath26 is small , using approximation @xmath71 we are left with @xmath72 .",
    "this is an intriguing property  by the two different approaches we obtained the same result . to compare @xmath64 in markets with different sizes ,",

    "[ kopt - improved ] . ]",
    "one can examine also the increase of the vendor s profit caused by the change of the sale method .",
    "using previous results , the approximate formula @xmath75/(np^2)$ ] can be obtained .",
    "we see that when the total number of variants @xmath1 is big , sequential offering results in a small growth of the vendor s profit . nevertheless , in a system with a limited offer ( small @xmath1 ) or with very choosy buyers ( very small @xmath26 ) , the improvement can be substantial .    here",
    "we should notice , that the stopping condition `` income greater than expenses '' introduced above can be hard to use in practice .",
    "it is because @xmath76 is a random quantity and can drop to the disadvantageous region @xmath77 even when @xmath65 is big enough to cover the expenses .",
    "thus for the vendor it is not enough to simply check profitability of the sale of one particular variant @xmath76 .",
    "rather he has to take into account sales of all previously offered variants .",
    "this is especially important in systems with a small number of buyers @xmath0 where relative fluctuations are bigger .",
    "this effect is shown in figure [ fig - improved ] where numerical results for the vendor blindly using the stopping condition are shown for various market sizes . clearly as @xmath0 increases , numerical results approach the analytical result ( [ kopt - improved ] ) .",
    "in real markets we seldom find a monopolist vendor ; competition and partition of the market is a natural phenomenon . to investigate the model behavior in such a case",
    "we introduce the second vendor to the market .",
    "we assume that the vendors differ by initial costs , which are @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "again we do not consider the influence of advertisements and reputation , albeit they are vital in a market competition .",
    "the course of the solution is similar to the one leading to eq .",
    "( [ profit ] ) .",
    "we label the number of variants offered by vendor 1 as @xmath80 , the number of variants offered by vendor 2 as @xmath81 , and we assume that there is no overlap between offered variants .",

    "therefore both vendors gain the share proportional to the number of variants they offer .",
    "thus vendor 1 takes @xmath84 of the total sale and vice versa .",
    "when @xmath85 , we can simplify the expected profits to the form    [ twovendors ] @xmath86    both parties maximize their profits by adjusting @xmath80 and @xmath81 . the corresponding system @xmath87 can not be solved analytically but its numerical treatment is straightforward . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - twovendors ] where we have fixed the initial cost @xmath79 to investigate how @xmath70 and @xmath54 for both vendors vary with @xmath78 .    .",

    "we obtain the expression for the value @xmath93 when this price - out occurs @xmath94 it is in a good agreement with the values found by a numerical simulation of the model .",
    "important feature of this result is that it depends on the initial price @xmath79 of the competitive vendor  decreasing the production costs can expel others from the market .    one can notice that when vendor 1 tries to increase the profit by deliberately increasing @xmath80 ( with the intention to increase the sale ) , the term @xmath95 prevents the success of this strategy . as a result , the vendors have to adapt to each other . in mathematic terms , @xmath96 . at the same time",
    ", the sum of profits is not maximized at @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "it is more profitable to remove the less efficient producer ( the one with the higher value of initial costs ) .",
    "this is an analogy of a real market where ruining ( or taking over ) of a competitor can improve company profit .",
    "now we would like to investigate the artificial case of the market where the vendor knows costs @xmath8 of all buyers .",
    "this knowledge can be used to increase the optimal profit .",
    "we start with a simpler question : if the vendor offers only one variant , how much the sale can be increased by a good choice of the variant ?",
    "the probability that buyer @xmath9 is agreeable to buy variant @xmath4 is @xmath99 .",
    "since costs @xmath8 are random and independent , only the average acceptance probability @xmath26 plays a role and the number of users willing to buy this variant , @xmath17 , is thus binomially distributed with the mean @xmath100 and the variance @xmath101 .",

    "since we are interested in big values of @xmath1 , we expect that the difference @xmath108 is big in comparison with @xmath109 .",
    "therefore we use the approximation @xmath110/\\sqrt{\\pi x^2}$ ] , which is valid for @xmath111 .",

    "the assumption @xmath27 has been used .",
    "a comparison of this result with a numerical simulation of the model is shown in fig .",

    "solid lines represent the analytical result , outcomes from numerical simulations are shown as symbols . ]",
    "when @xmath120 , all vendor s information is indeed useless and the average sale improvement is negligible .",
    "the inequality @xmath120 leads to the condition @xmath121 thus when the number of variants is not large enough , buyers opinions in the uncorrelated market can not be used to increase the vendor s sale and profit .    from the previous results we can draw useful implications about the vendor with perfect information , offering more than only one variant . when the total number of variants @xmath1 is big , the number of variants offered by the vendor is small in comparison with @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the average sale of all offered variants is increased at most by @xmath122 given by eq .",
    "( [ informed - growth ] ) and the same applies to the total sale .",
    "however , the vendor is interested mainly in his profit .",
    "when we take into account different costs @xmath10 of variants , the resulting growth of the income due to the informations is even smaller than @xmath122 because the variant with the highest sale can have a high cost for the vendor .",
    "thus condition ( [ useless - info ] ) is has more general consequences .",
    "it specifies the circumstances when even the perfect information about buyers preferences do not help the vendor to achieve a significant improvement of his profit .",
    "now we would like to add one important flavor to the model  correlations .",
    "they arise from conformity of people s tastes ( buyer - buyer correlations ) and from the fact that high quality preferred by buyers results in high costs on the vendor s side ( buyer - vendor anticorrelations ) . to approach the behavior of a real market",
    ", we investigate how these correlations influence our results obtained so far . before doing so",
    ", we briefly discuss correlations from a general point of view .",
    "a correlation is the degree to which two or more quantities are associated .",

    "in addition , since it originates in the least - square fitting of the data by a straight line , it measures only a linear correlation . for this reasons",

    "this result scales with @xmath0 and @xmath232 in the same way as the previous outcome of the detailed derivation .    at the end",
    "we have to mention that this model of transactions between the vendor and buyers is not relevant for a high number of buyers because @xmath252 decreases very slowly in this case .",
    "in other words : when @xmath0 is high , the probability that there is a variant that is not worst in any buyer list approaches zero .      from the previous discussion we know that in a big market vendor can not insist on selling only one variant .",

    ", they exhibit many features of real markets . in particular , diversification of the vendor s production and market competition",
    "are used as examples .",
    "the diversification is presented as an interplay between the vendor s pursuit to follow the buyers tastes and the costs growing with the number of produced variants .",
    "we also show that in a market with many buyers without preferences correlations , the knowledge of these preferences does nt increase the vendor s profit .",
    "when correlations are introduced to the system , many technical complications arise .",
    "nevertheless , the results are consistent with the expectations : a positive correlation between the buyers and vendor s costs improves the vendor s profit . also , when interests of the two parties diverge ( the correlation are negative ) , the vendor is able to make only a small or even no profit .",
    "in addition , in sec .  [ sec - model2 ] a similarly aimed model based on the well - known matching problem is investigated .",
    "as many other directions can be explored further , we do not consider this topic exhausted .",
