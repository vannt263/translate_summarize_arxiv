    "they also found evidence of a weaker interaction of cholesterol with phosphatidylcholines than with sphingomyelin .",
    "+ nielsen and co - workers @xcite have proposed a set of simple models to study the phase equilibria in two - dimensional condensed systems of particles where both translational and internal degrees of freedom are present and are coupled through microscopic interactions .",

    "the concept of random lattice model @xcite has been used to account for the coupling between the two degrees of freedom of lipid molecules , since it has been found experimentally that the chain conformational and translational order appear / disappear simultaneously at the main transition temperature .",

    "the presence of cholesterol decouples the two ordering processes leading to a liquid ordered ( * lo * ) phase in which bilayers are liquid having translational disorder while lipid chains are conformationally ordered .",
    "+ cluster formation is mainly due to preferential packing of sphingolipid and cholesterol molecules .",
    "sphingolipid head groups occupy larger excluded areas in the plane of the exoplasmic leaflet than do their predominantly saturated hydrocarbon chains .",
    "cholesterol molecule being hydrophobic in nature tries to occupy the voids between associated sphingolipid chains .",

    "a cholesterol molecule , not assigned with any internal degrees of freedom , tries to secure ordered lipid - chain conformation in * ld * phase , while it has a tendency to break lipid translational order in * so * phase .",

    "the phase diagrams establish the coexistence of ( * so + lo * ) phases at low temperatures and ( * ld + lo * ) phases at high temperatures .",
    "the system has been studied for different cholesterol concentrations but for a single canonical domain formation simulation , the cholesterol number is kept fixed . + a thermodynamic model for condensed complexes of cholesterol and phospholipid in a monolayer mixture was studied by anderson and mcconnell @xcite , while the chemical activity of cholesterol in this context was explored by radhakrishnan and mcconnell @xcite .",
