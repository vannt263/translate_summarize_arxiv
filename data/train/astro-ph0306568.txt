    "understanding the formation of galactic discs is one of the most important , unsolved problems in astrophysics . in the currently favoured cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "cosmological framework , in which structure builds up hierarchically @xcite , discs are assumed to form in the potential wells of virialised dark matter halos through radiative cooling @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "baryons are required to retain most of the angular momentum imparted to them by tidal torques in order for the resulting centrifugally supported discs to have realistic sizes .",
    "the conservation of gas angular momentum is an important assumption made in semi - analytic modelling of disc formation @xcite .",
    "however , to date , numerical simulations of galaxy formation starting from appropriate cdm initial conditions , and allowing just radiative cooling of the gas and no star formation or feedback , find that the infalling gas loses too much angular momentum .",
    "this results in discs forming which are much too small ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this problem is commonly called `` the angular momentum problem '' .",
    "the angular momentum losses arise during the hierarchical clustering process . at early times in a cdm dominated universe , small dense dark matter halos form .",
    "radiative cooling is very efficient in these objects and a large fraction of the gas cools into them . as these gas rich halos merge to form larger halos their incoming orbital angular momentum is drained by dynamical friction and exported to the dark matter at the outskirts of the new halos .",
    "much of the original angular momentum of the gas is lost through these processes by the time it reaches the middle and forms a disc .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that if cooling is suppressed until the host halos are well established , then the numerical simulations yield much larger discs .",
    "two ideas have been suggested which might prevent the early collapse of small proto - galactic gas clouds .",
    "one is that cooling may be suppressed by feedback due to energy injected by stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "simulations invoking very energetic feedback have illustrated the possibility of resolving the angular momentum problem in this way . @xcite .",
    "the second idea that has been suggested to prevent the formation of small proto - galactic clouds is to invoke an alternative form of dark matter , `` warm dark matter , '' in which case the initial density field does not have small scale fluctuations @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that galaxies formed in this model have larger discs and smaller bulges than in simulations with cdm .",
    "the angular momentum problem is potentially a strong clue which can help unravel the processes of galaxy formation and the complicated star formation and feedback processes involved . for this to be possible , however",
    ", we must be careful to understand the role of any numerical effects which may be important in determining the outcome of galaxy formation simulations .    smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) has been widely used to study galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) both because its fully lagrangian nature is suited to problems that need a wide dynamic range like galaxy formation , and because of its simplicity and robustness which make it easy to incorporate into @xmath0-body codes . despite these attractive features , there are problems .",
    "first of all , most of the sph implementations utilise an artificial viscosity to capture shocks ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    ". this artificial viscosity can introduce numerical momentum and angular momentum transport , and spurious energy dissipation .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that the angular momentum of a simulated galaxy increased when they used higher resolution .",
    "another problem arises from sph s intrinsic smoothing properties .",
    "since sph represents a fluid element by smoothing over neighbouring particles , it is not well suited for treating large density and velocity gradients .",
    "this can be a serious problem when a cold gas disc forms through radiative cooling in an ambient hot gas at the virial temperature .",
    "in this situation , the cold gas disc is much denser than the hot gas and generally rotates faster than the ambient hot medium .",
    "in addition , because star formation can lead to a decrease in the number of particles in the disc ( @xmath1 90 % of baryonic matter becomes stars in a disc ) , the effective spatial resolution degrades with time , an effect which may play an important role at low redshift .    in this paper",
    "we investigate angular momentum transfer from a cold gas disc to the hot halo gas and its effect on the simulation outcomes .",
    "although alternative techniques based on eulerian approaches coupled with a grid refinement scheme  adaptive mesh refinement ( amr )  have been recently implemented in cosmology ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , we concentrate here on numerical effects in sph simulations of galaxy formation because sph is by far the most widely used method in this area .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "a brief description of our simulation code is given in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we carry out cosmological simulations of disc formation in a virialised halo , and then demonstrate there is angular momentum transfer from the cold gas disc to the ambient hot gas . a forensic study is performed in section 4 using simplified simulations to find the source of the problem and the dependence on the numerical resolution . in section 5",
    "we propose that decoupling of cold gas from ambient hot gas can avoid the problems found in earlier sections .",
    "the effect of the decoupling is shown using simplified simulations and cosmological simulations .",
    "the results are summarised and discussed in section 6 .",
    "we use a modified and extended version of the parallel treesph code gadget @xcite . unless otherwise specified",
    ", we will use the novel formulation of sph that manifestly conserves energy and entropy when appropriate @xcite throughout this paper .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this formulation greatly reduces numerical inaccuracies compared to the more commonly used formulations .",
    "gadget employs an artificial viscosity which is the shear - reduced version @xcite of the `` standard '' @xcite artificial viscosity .",
    "@xcite and @xcite endorsed this form of the artificial viscosity .",
    "we set the parameter @xmath2 that appears in eq .",
    "27 of @xcite to 0.75 .",
    "we have checked that the choice of the value of this parameter hardly affects our results .",
    "we also modify the gradient of the smoothing kernel from the public version of gadget according to @xcite to overcome the clumping instability @xcite .",
    "gadget adopts the kernel , @xmath3 , so - called @xmath4-spline @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the particle separation and smoothing length , respectively , and @xmath8 .",
    "note that the smoothing kernel is defined over the interval @xmath9 $ ] and not @xmath10 $ ] as is more common .",
    "the kernel gradient vanishes at @xmath11 , i.e. the pressure gradient forces between two close sph particles vanishes in the limit of small separation .",
    "we modify the gradient for @xmath12 so that even close pairs of sph particles continue to repel each other , but leave the kernel itself unchanged , @xmath13 except in cosmological simulations , where we solve for the ionisation , we assume a fixed mean molecular weight , @xmath14 , corresponding to a fully ionised gas of primordial composition .",
    "we use the adiabatic index , @xmath15 throughout this paper .",
    "in order to study disc formation and to concentrate on the investigation of numerical angular momentum transfer , we wish to avoid the physical angular momentum losses which occur during hierarchical clustering as much as possible while retaining a degree of realism . to meet these requirements , we choose a halo , from a pre - existing @xmath0-body simulation , that is known to have a quiet merger history  the redshift of the last major merger is larger than 1 .",
    "in addition the gas is not allowed to cool radiatively until after @xmath16 .",
    "after this both cooling and star formation are allowed .",
    "this procedure completely suppresses the early formation of proto - galactic clouds and leads to quiescent gas accretion for @xmath17 , with the result that a disc forms with a reasonable size @xcite .",
    "the details of the simulation are described in the following subsections .",
    "the background cosmology that we assume is a low - density flat cdm universe ( @xmath18cdm ) .",
    "this model is currently the favourite amongst hierarchical clustering models .",
    "we use the following choice of the cosmological parameters : @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 = 0.7 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . the baryon density ,",
    "@xmath23 is set to 0.04 @xcite .    to generate our initial conditions",
    ", we use the resimulation technique introduced by @xcite .",
    "we first perform a dark matter only simulation in a @xmath24 mpc periodic cube . on this scale ,",
    "the density fluctuations are still in the linear regime at @xmath25 .",
    "having completed this simulation , we then select a dark halo that has a quiet merger history .",
    "the halo s mass is about @xmath26 within the sphere having virial overdensity , @xmath27 at @xmath25 . to make the new initial conditions , the initial density field of the parent simulation",
    "is recreated and appropriate additional short wavelength perturbations are added to the region out of which the halo forms . in this region",
    "we also place sph particles in a ratio of 1:1 with dark matter particles .",
    "the region external to this was populated with high mass dark matter particles whose function is to reproduce the appropriate tidal fields .",
    "the initial redshift of the simulation is 50 .",
    "the masses of the sph and high resolution dark matter particles are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the gravitational softening length for the sph particles is kept fixed in comoving coordinates for @xmath30 and after this , it is frozen in physical units to a value of 0.5 kpc , in terms of the ` equivalent ' plummer softening given in @xcite .",
    "the gravitational force obeys the exact @xmath31 law at @xmath32 .",
    "the softening lengths for all particles are defined as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the particle mass of a particle ` p ' and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the softening and mass of the sph particles .",
    "we do not allow the smoothing length to become smaller than a minimum value of @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath17 the cooling / heating rate and ionisation state of each particle are calculated assuming collisional ionisation equilibrium and the presence of an evolving but uniform uv background @xcite by using the fitting formula provided by @xcite .",
    "a primordial composition for the gas is assumed .",
    "inverse compton cooling is also considered at @xmath17 although the effect is minor .",
    "since we do not include molecular cooling , the coolest gas typically has a temperature @xmath38  k. we define the gas in an overdense region that has a temperature @xmath39  k as `` cold gas . ''",
    "cold gas particles are eligible to form stars when the following criteria are satisfied : ( i ) the gas particle is in a converging flow ( @xmath40 ) and ( ii ) the density of the gas particle is above a threshold density ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "we use @xmath42 g @xmath43 .",
    "the value that we adopt is higher than the typical value used in other cosmological simulations , @xmath44 g @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this choice allows us to have sufficient cold gas to observe the numerical effect on the cold phase .",
    "note that @xcite found that the criterion on the velocity divergence has no sizeable effect on their results , and so criterion ( i ) may not be needed .",
    "we ignore the jeans condition , used by some other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for reasons detailed below .",
    "the jeans condition is usually denoted as @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the smoothing length , the sound speed , and the dynamical time of the gas particle ` @xmath49 ' , respectively .",
    "since the @xmath46 have no direct physical significance in the sph formalism , and depend for example on the particle mass , adopting such a jeans condition , as given above , would introduce an unphysical resolution dependence into the simulations .",
    "in fact this jeans condition should be regarded as determining the resolution limit rather than as a star formation criterion . @xcite",
    "have shown that if the minimum resolvable mass @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the number of neighbours used in the sph calculation , becomes larger than the local jeans mass , @xmath52 , artificial fragmentation may occur , and real fragmentation will definitely be suppressed . in our adopted sph implementation , the smoothing length , @xmath46 ,",
    "is defined as @xmath53 , and one finds combining these relations that the above resolution limit is equivalent to @xmath54 it is clear that the condition represented by eq .",
    "[ jeans1 ] is hardly satisfied if the condition represented by eq .",
    "[ jeans2 ] is satisfied .",
    "we adopt @xmath51 = 40 in this paper , and this gives , for a gas temperature , @xmath55 k , that for densities below @xmath56 g @xmath43 the sph treatment of the gas is reliable . note",
    "that this is well below our threshold density @xmath57 for star formation .",
    "therefore , our results may be affected by artificial effects because of insufficient mass resolution .    when a gas particle is eligible to form stars , the star formation rate ( sfr ) for a particle ` @xmath49 ' is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a dimensionless sfr parameter .",
    "this formula corresponds to the schmidt law that implies an sfr proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "the value of @xmath59 controls the star formation efficiency .",
    "the physics of star formation is not understood well enough to predict the value of this parameter .",
    "it is known for spiral galaxies that the star formation time - scale is long compared to the dynamical time - scale , so to mimic this , the value of @xmath59 must be significantly less than unity .",
    "we assume a value of @xmath61 throughout this paper .",
    "this is consistent with the relatively small values of @xmath59 used in simulations of disc formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for an sph particle , of mass @xmath62 , which is eligible to form a star , of mass @xmath63 , the probability of this event occurring during a time - step @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 .",
    "\\label{prob}\\ ] ] we use two star formation recipes to study the dependence of the results on the star formation scheme and also the number of particles left in a cold gas disc . in the first recipe , a gas particle is completely converted into a stellar particle during @xmath64 so that @xmath66 in eq .",
    "we call a simulation using this star formation scheme a `` conversion run '' .",
    "the other recipe allows an initial sph particle to spawn up to three stellar particles with mass of @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the original mass of the sph particle , so that the values possible for @xmath69 are 3 , 2 or 1 .",
    "this scheme reduces the rapid decrease in the number of cold gas particles in the disc due to star formation , and helps counter the large drop in the sph spatial resolution which otherwise occurs as the cold gas is used up .",
    "the simulation which employs this scheme is dubbed a `` spawning run . ''      .",
    "the upper 4 panels and the lower 4 panels are for the conversion run and the spawning run respectively .",
    "the left panels show the stellar distributions and the right panels show the cold gas distributions .",
    "the greyscale is coded by surface density and three dimensional density for stars and cold gas , respectively .",

    ", width=302 ]        in fig .",
    "[ z0 ] , we show the distributions of stars and cold gas in the conversion and spawning runs at @xmath25 . the galaxy in the spawning run has a smoother stellar distribution than in the conversion run as expected . although the galaxy in the conversion run has a stronger bar , we can not find any significant difference in the distribution of the stars when we compare the surface density profiles of these galaxies .",
    "however , the morphologies of the cold gas discs are quite different .",
    "the cold gas disc in the conversion run has a core and ring structure : the cold gas disc has large holes and most of the cold gas particles are found in dense filaments .",
    "the cold gas disc in the spawning run is perhaps more realistic with spiral arm - like features , though a large fraction of the cold gas lives in the arms .",
    "one might think that the fragmentation is caused by the toomre instability .",
    "however , we find that when we calculate the value of toomre s @xmath71-parameter for the azimuthally averaged surface gas density , that @xmath72 is satisfied everywhere and at all redshifts . because of efficient star formation , the gas surface density never reaches high values .",
    "having ruled out the toomre instability we need to examine the time evolution of the gas distributions to understand the physical or numerical mechanisms that cause the break up of the cold gas discs .",
    "the distributions of the cold gas particles are shown in fig .",
    "[ redshift ] for several redshifts in each simulation .",
    "we find that the core  ring structure is very common , regardless of the star formation scheme .",
    "the spawning galaxy has a larger - sized cold gas disc at lower redshift than the conversion galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that there is angular momentum transfer away from cold gas in a way which depends on the number of the cold gas particles .",
    "since star formation turns low angular momentum gas particles into collisionless stellar particles and the gas particles that accrete onto the disc later tend to have larger angular momenta , the specific angular momentum of the cold gas disc should monotonically increase with time .",
    "we plot the evolution of the specific angular momentum of the cold gas disc in fig .",
    "[ jcold1 ] . here",
    ", we consider the material in a sphere of radius 20 @xmath73 kpc , which is centred on the galaxy centre at each redshift .",
    "the specific angular momentum for the conversion run shows surprisingly little evolution , being nearly constant .",
    "in contrast , the angular momentum of the cold gas disc in the spawning run increases monotonically except for the last few gigayears .",
    "this indicates that more angular momentum is lost from the cold gas disc in the conversion run compared to the spawning run .",
    "the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ jcold1 ] shows the integrated cooling rates ( the mass in stars and cold gas at each redshift ) in the galaxies .",
    "the figure shows that the cooling in the conversion run is suppressed relative to the spawning run .",
    "this indicates that a significant amount of angular momentum from the cold gas disc in the conversion run has been transfered to the ambient hot gas , and that the cooling rate has decreased because the hot gas has been puffed up by this `` angular momentum feedback . ''",
    "since the difference in the amount of cold gas in the discs between the two simulations is small , the difference in the masses of the cooled baryon ( i.e. cold gas and stars ) is mainly due to the difference in the masses of stellar discs . by comparing the evolution of the angular momenta of the cold gas discs and the number of cold gas particles in the discs ( upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ jcold1 ] ) , one might draw a naive conclusion that at least 2000 cold gas particles are needed to suppress the angular momentum transfer .",
    "however , we have to understand the mechanism that causes the angular momentum transfer and the fragmentation of the cold gas disc before we can reach definite conclusions .    to this end , we next investigate the hydrodynamic torques acting on the cold gas particles . in fig .",
    "[ torque1 ] , we plot the azimuthally averaged specific hydrodynamic torques acting on the cold gas particles for the spawning simulation for 5 radial bins .",
    "the negative value indicates that the torque spins down the rotation of the disc . as expected from fig .",
    "[ jcold1 ] , the absolute magnitude of the torque is larger at lower redshift .",
    "surprisingly , the torque is dominated not by the artificial viscosity but by the contribution to the force due to pressure gradients .",
    "the total hydrodynamic torques normalised by the angular momenta of the cold gas discs ( @xmath74 ) at @xmath25 are -0.84 and -0.90 gyr@xmath20 for the conversion and spawning runs , respectively .",
    "this means that the hydrodynamic torque can stop the rotation completely in only @xmath75 gyr . while the number of the cold gas particles in the spawning run is more than twice as large as that in the conversion run , both discs receive comparable torques at @xmath25 .",
    "this implies that the strength of the hydrodynamic torque is defined by the distribution ( morphology ) of the cold gas as well as the number of the cold gas particles in the disc .    .",
    "the dotted line shows the torque when we ignore the interaction between the cold gas ( @xmath39 k ) and the hot gas ( @xmath76 k ) particles .",
    ", width=302 ]    to know whether there is significant angular momentum transfer between the cold gas particles at different radii , we calculate the instantaneous hydrodynamic torque acting on the cold gas disc ignoring the interaction between the cold ( @xmath39 k ) and hot ( @xmath77 k ) phases .",
    "[ torque2 ] shows the original torque that is identical to the solid line in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ torque1 ] and the torque ignoring the hot gas .",
    "we find that the hydrodynamic torque becomes almost 0 at all radii when we decouple instantaneously the cold and hot phases .",
    "there is no significant transport of angular momentum within the cold gas itself .",
    "this confirms results from previous studies , which insist that the angular momentum transfer in the galactic disc itself can not be a serious problem over a hubble time when the shear - reduced artificial viscosity is adopted ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , all test simulations have been performed in the absence of a surrounding ( hot ) medium .    since our results indicate that the artificial viscosity is not very important for the angular momentum transfer , the transfer may be caused by fragmentation or may cause the fragmentation .",
    "we will investigate this point using simplified simulations in the next section .",
    "we note that , the gravitational torque acting on the cold gas disc is also significant when the cold gas is fragmented .",
    "several authors have presented shear flow tests using sph , and their results are promising @xcite .",
    "however , these studies have focused primarily on the variation resulting from using different sph implementations . here , we consider the impact of varying numerical resolution upon the momentum transferred across sharp velocity gradients , with or without associated sharp density gradients .",
    "we use simulations of a periodic cube of side 10 kpc , containing @xmath78 of gas , to investigate the sph transfer of momentum across a discontinuity in the velocity field .",
    "the gas is all given a temperature of @xmath79 k. particles in the central slab with @xmath80 kpc are given a velocity of @xmath81 km s@xmath20 , and the remaining gas is set up with @xmath82 km s@xmath20 . at this relative velocity of 100 km s@xmath20 , it takes @xmath83 myr to cross the box .",
    "the self - gravity of the gas is ignored for simplicity , and replaced with an external potential of the form @xmath84   ( { \\rm km } \\ { \\rm s}^{-1})^2 ,   \\label{extpot}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the side length of the simulation box .",
    "the choice of external potential is not very important because the transfer of momentum is not greatly affected by the size of the instabilities that it suppresses . to generate relaxed initial conditions ,",
    "we first distribute particles using the rejection method assuming hydrostatic equilibrium to calculate the density .",
    "this system is evolved without any shear , while damping the particle temperature and velocity until a relaxed state is reached .",
    "then the shear is introduced and the tests are commenced .",
    "simulations have been run with @xmath86 and @xmath87",
    ". a single variant of sph has been used for the runs in this subsection , but we do consider some other popular flavours with different symmetrisations in subsection  [ sssec : othersph ] .",
    "we have also used the three - dimensional eulerian fixed - grid hydrodynamic code described by @xcite to provide a comparison . this finite difference ( fd )",
    "code employs a riemann solver to compute the numerical viscosity , thus removing the need for an artificial viscosity , and has already been used to simulate gas stripping from a galaxy by the ram pressure of the intracluster medium ( icm ) @xcite and the evolution of a bubble in the icm @xcite .",
    "we set up the same initial conditions for the shear test on @xmath88 cells .",
    "this number provides ample resolution and ensures that each cell hosts only one phase initially .",
    "random noise is added to the density in each cell ( @xmath89 ) , otherwise nothing will happen .    the evolution of the velocity profile for each simulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ singlev ] . for",
    "the sph runs employing only 40 neighbours , the velocity shear decays rapidly owing to momentum transfer across the shear boundary . using 320 neighbours , the transfer of momentum is significantly suppressed . in the fd simulation , the width of the distribution of @xmath90 values at a particular @xmath70 coordinate reflects large scale turbulence that is not apparent in the sph runs .",
    "the peak velocities are typically larger and the velocities of the layers distant from the contact surfaces remain intact even after 5 box crossings of evolution .    by its very nature , sph is not well - suited to solving problems involving large discontinuities . in the following subsection we will show more vividly how the sph and fd methods give qualitatively different results regarding turbulence .",
    "however , it is instructive to understand the difference between the sph runs considered above . as we have seen , the hydrodynamical force can be split into two components : pressure gradients and artificial viscosity .",
    "the latter depends upon the relative velocity of the fluids and the size of the interacting volume",
    ". this boundary layer should be the same for the @xmath91 and @xmath87 simulations , because @xmath92 is identical .",

    "[ killer ] shows at early times that these two simulations do lose momentum at a similar rate .",
    "the @xmath93 run , and its smaller boundary layer , initially slow down less rapidly . as the relative velocity of the gases decreases , the dominant force leading to deceleration becomes that coming from pressure gradients .",
    "this depends on @xmath51 , such that more neighbours yield smaller decelerations .",
    "thus , it seems to be noisiness in the sph smoothing of variables which gives rise to these pressure gradients and a significant proportion of the deceleration .",

    "[ killer ] shows the reduced deceleration of the @xmath87 run relative to the other two .",

    "@xcite pointed out that density errors in sph simulations of shear flows can be substantially suppressed by treating particle velocity and fluid velocity separately .",

    "this is due to ram pressure caused by the creation of holes once enough gas particles have been converted to stars . in the @xmath120 simulation ,",
    "this torque becomes stronger than that caused by the artificial viscosity .",
    "thus , even in this best - resolved simulation , the cold gas disc is depleted to an extent where resolution - dependent holes are formed and resolution - dependent fractions of the angular momentum are lost .",
    "in the previous sections we have seen that the angular momentum transfer from the cold gas to the hot halo gas is mainly caused by numerical problems which are intrinsic to the sph technique .",
    "the collapsing rotating sphere test in the previous section reveals that the problem becomes worse when star formation is included .",
    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "star formation decreases the number of particles in the cold gas disc causing the disc to becomes thinner .",
    "we had found in the preceding section that a disc is prone to develop holes when the number of particles in it is not sufficient .",
    "once these holes appear , ram pressure between the hot and cold gas phases becomes important and a rapid loss of angular momentum from the cold gas ensues .",
    "it is interesting therefore to see what happens when we inhibit the angular momentum transfer from cold gas to hot gas in simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "this can be achieved in a drastic way by decoupling the cold and hot phases .",
    "@xcite proposed a decoupling technique whereby the contribution to the hot gas particles density from the cold gas particles is explicitly ignored .",
    "this has the effect of suppressing the overcooling of the hot gas that otherwise results . in this scheme",
    "hot and cold particles nonetheless interact through mutual hydrodynamical forces .",
    "our approach is more radical : hot and cold particles do not interact at all except through gravity .",
    "the cold and hot phases are treated as independent fluids .",
    "our approach is quite similar to the multi - phase model proposed by @xcite in which they represents a warm phase by sph particles and the ism by sticky particles and do not allow the ism to interact with ambient gas hydrodynamically . while clearly we miss some real physics as a result of such decoupling , the physics that we miss can not be modelled properly using sph anyway as we have shown . in the following subsections",
    "we show simulations of disc formation adopting this decoupling technique .",
    "the technique of decoupling is appropriate in situations in which the pressure from the hot gas is unimportant in confining the cold gas component and when the pressure at the midplane of the cold gas disc is sufficiently greater than the external pressure on the contact surfaces .",
    "in such a situation , the self - gravitating gas disc can be a good approximation .",

    "apart from the lowest resolution simulation , the simulations no longer show a decrease in the specific angular momentum as a function of time .",
    "even the lowest resolution simulation shows a decline which starts much later and the disc ends up with much larger specific angular momentum than in the normal sph simulation .",
    "this proves that most of the angular momentum loss from the cold gas disc is due to the hydrodynamic interaction with the ambient hot gas , which can not be dealt with adequately by sph .",
    "a resolution dependence is still present , because the accreting gas can have large velocity shears before it reaches the temperature below which it becomes decoupled from the hot gas .",
    "we have also investigated the torque that causes the decline of the angular momentum of the cold gas disc in the lowest resolution simulation .",
    "we find that most of the negative torque is coming from the gravitational interaction with stellar and dark matter particles .",
    "we conjecture that this is because the density distributions of the cold gas disc and the stellar disc are not smooth enough to prevent angular momentum transfer due to tidal torques .    in fig .",
    "[ stardcpcoldgas ] , we show the face - on views of the cold gas discs in the simulations using @xmath121 and 130536 .",

    "the angular momentum evolution shows better convergence than in the normal sph simulations .",
    "the reason why the stellar disc in the @xmath123 simulation has larger specific angular momentum than that in the @xmath124 simulation is as follows .",
    "although the cold phase is decoupled from the hot phase , angular momentum transfer to the hot gas during accretion before the gas temperature has reached the decoupling threshold ( @xmath125  k ; see section  4.2.1 ) is still allowed .",
    "consequently , the lower resolution simulation produces a lower angular momentum cold gas disc .",
    "since the local star formation rate is a function of density and we impose a threshold density for star formation , the low angular momentum of the cold gas disc does not always result in a lower angular momentum for the stellar disc .",
    "higher angular momentum gas particles are often not dense enough to be eligible for star formation .",
    "thus , the angular momentum transfer that brings such gas particles to the inner disc where the gas particles can form stars sometimes produces a higher angular momentum stellar disc .",
    "the increasing resolution is also likely to increase the angular momentum of the stellar disc , because higher mass resolution allows fragmentation to be resolved in less dense environments . as a result",
    ", the high angular momentum gas particles that can not form stars in a low resolution simulation are allowed to form stars if they reside in the dense structures like spiral arms that are resolved with higher resolution ( see fig .",
    "[ stardcpcoldgas ] ) .",
    "the above complex picture also provides a reasonable explanation for the fact that , at the highest resolution , the stellar disc in the normal sph simulation ( fig  15 ) has a slightly higher angular momentum than in the simulation with decoupling ( fig  19 ) , despite the fact that the angular momentum of the cold gas disc in the normal sph simulation is lower than in the simulation with decoupling .",
    "the angular momentum transfer from the cold gas makes more cold gas particles eligible to form stars and the holes in the cold gas disc enhance the density of the cold gas disc at large radii .",
    "of course , the pressure from the hot gas also enhances the density and thus the star formation rate all over the disc , but , as we have seen , this process can not be modelled appropriately by sph .",
    "the age - angular momentum distribution exhibits the outside - in disc formation feature again , although this is weaker than in the standard sph simulation .",
    "this is not surprising because the star forming region shrinks when the surface density of the cold gas disc is reduced by star formation . however , as we mentioned above , higher resolution allows stars to form in the outskirts of the disc even when the surface gas density becomes quite low . hence the outside - in feature becomes weaker with increasing resolution .",
    "even though the resolution limits for the @xmath124 and 130536 simulations ( eq . [ jeans2 ] ) are far below the threshold density for star formation ( @xmath126 g @xmath43 ) , the age - angular momentum distributions do not converge .",

    "since the cold gas particles have a temperature @xmath128  k , that is one order of magnitude smaller than the lower limit in the idealised simulations of section  4 , the cold gas discs are much thiner .",
    "this makes the problems encountered in the shear tests more serious .",
    "consequently , the cold gas disc will have an unphysical morphology because of numerical effects _ unless _ we decouple the cold gas from the hot halo gas .",

    "this might be because the cold gas disc in the spawning case is less affected by the angular momentum transfer between the cold gas and the warm gas , although we can not find any significant difference in the hydrodynamic and tidal torques in these two simulations . to decide whether the high specific angular momentum of the cold gas disc in the spawning run is the result of the larger number of cold gas particles or a side effect of the multi - mass sph imposed by this star formation prescription , we would have to perform another conversion simulation with a larger number of the sph particles leaving all other conditions unchanged . in this paper",

    ". these may be just a coincidence .",
    "since we impose a relatively high density threshold as a star formation criterion , only cold gas particles that have small angular momenta can form stars and thus the threshold density determines the angular momenta of the stellar discs .",
    "it makes the specific angular momentum evolution of the stellar discs almost independent of those of the cold gas discs .    in the standard sph simulation with the conversion star formation prescription , the formation of holes in the cold gas disc results in the cold gas being swept out to form a dense ring at large radius at high redshifts ( see the top left panel of fig .  [ redshift ] ) .",

    ". since these holes are numerical artifacts as we showed in the shear tests , the large angular momentum of the stellar disc and the high angular momentum population in the standard sph simulations are numerical artifacts as well .",
    "if the gas disc is puffed up by some feedback processes and if we choose a lower threshold density for star formation , the simulations with and without decoupling would produce different results as in the case of the idealised simulations with the temperature floor at @xmath130 k. the idealised simulations and the cosmological simulations presented in this paper suggest that the angular momentum transfer from the cold gas disc sometimes results in too large and sometimes too small angular momentum of the stellar disc depending on the resolution and the modelling of the ism and star formation .",
    "it thus must depend on the modelling of feedback as well .",
    "we have found in a cosmological sph simulation that a disc of cold gas breaks up into filaments and there is a significant transfer of angular momentum from the cold gas disc to the ambient hot halo gas .",
    "the dominant contribution to the hydrodynamical torque between the cold and hot phases comes from the pressure gradient forces and not from the artificial viscosity .",
    "the hot gas is puffed up by this angular momentum ` feedback ' and this , in turn , can affect the cooling rate .    by using simple shear tests",
    ", we find that sph can not correctly solve problems where there are strong shear flows .",
    "when a dense cold gas sheet is moving in ambient diffuse hot gas , the gas sheet receives strong negative acceleration due to pressure gradients and artificial viscosity . by varying the number of neighbouring particles involved in the sph smoothing ,",
    "we find that the deceleration due to pressure gradients is related to the noisiness in sph variables . moreover , if the cold gas sheet does not contain a sufficient number of particles , it undergoes hole formation .",
    "ram pressure from the hot gas in these holes leads to further momentum transfer .",
    "the comparison of simulations using sph and a finite - difference eulerian code clearly exhibits a shortcoming of the sph method : sph does not generate the turbulent mixing of the fluid components in the shear flow tests that is present with the eulerian code . instead , with sph the fluid velocities change to damp out the shear flow but without any mixing of fluids .",
    "this feature of sph only becomes problematic when there are large velocity gradients .",
    "since previous test simulations did not consider such a large shear , sph has produced promising results . however , as we have shown in this paper , such a large shear can exist in galaxy formation problems where a rotationally supported cold gas disc forms within hot halo gas that is mainly supported by thermal pressure .",
    "the idealised simulations of disc formation in rotating hot gas reveal that this problem has a strong dependence on the resolution .",
    "having star formation in a simulation makes the situation worse by decreasing the number of cold gas particles .",
    "if not enough particles are used , the angular momentum of the cold gas disc steeply declines with time .",
    "consequently , the stellar disc forms from the outside to the inside .",
    "this process may explain the outside - in formation of disc galaxies found in the simulations by @xcite .",
    "one way to avoid these problems , is to decouple the cold and hot gas phases . in the simulations with decoupling , the specific angular momenta of the cold gas discs become monotonically increasing functions of time as expected on theoretical grounds .",
    "the main difference from the standard sph simulations is seen in the morphology of cold gas discs .",
    "the simulations with decoupling produce smooth extended cold gas discs that do not have any holes .",
    "these simulations also reveal that the numerical angular momentum transfer sometimes increases the specific angular momenta of stellar discs and sometimes decreases them , while it always decreases the specific angular momenta of cold gas discs .",
    "this strange feature is caused by the density dependence of star formation .",
    "hence , the way in which this problem affects stellar discs is highly dependent on resolution and on the modelling of subgrid physics in the interstellar medium .",
    "we do not believe that the angular momentum transfer that we have identified here is the main explanation for the angular momentum problem in galaxy formation simulations , because the difference in the specific angular momenta of stellar discs between simulations with and without decoupling is not that large , although it seems to depend strongly on the modelling of subgrid physics such as star formation . at higher resolution ,",
    "the numerical breaking up of cold gas discs is likely to increase the specific angular momentum of the stellar discs by enhancing the cold gas density and hence star formation rate in the outskirts of the discs .",
    "anyway , as long as the cold gas disc suffers spurious angular momentum transfer and has a strange morphology , the properties of the resulting stellar disc are quite unreliable .",
    "the angular momentum transfer rakes up all the cold gas into the star forming region and spurious fragmentation of the disc induces quite effective star formation in these dense filaments .",
    "consequently , the problem can be much more serious when one investigates the details of simulated galaxies like the cold gas distribution , the hot gas distribution , the distribution of stellar populations , and all observables related to them .",
    "the problem may also affect simulations of elliptical galaxies .",
    "after the galaxy has exhausted most of its cold gas in , for example , a starburst , newly accreting cold gas is quickly supplied to the centre regardless of its angular momentum ( newly accreting cold gas implies the existence of halo gas ) .",
    "the decoupling of the cold and hot gas phases that we have introduced offers the opportunity to investigate the detailed structure of galaxies by avoiding this spurious angular momentum transfer .",
    "however , it seems clear that complex physical processes taking place in the interstellar medium and in the hot halo gas must play a key role in galaxy formation .",
    "a code that can solve problems involving large shear motions , together with the ability to treat a wide dynamic range , is required to study these processes in detail .",
    "amr is an obvious candidate , although it has not yet been widely used in this subject , and thus still needs substantial testing . on the other hand , substantial refinements of sph",
    "have been introduced recently which could prove useful in this context , for example ( * ? ? ?",

    "* consistent particle velocity with fluid velocity ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* adaptive mass resolution ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conservation of both entropy and energy ) .",
    "we encourage colleagues who have developed and implemented these refinements to perform the shear tests presented in this paper .",
    "the implementation by @xcite is particularly interesting since it substantially suppresses spurious density errors in sph calculations of shear flows .",
    "the phase decoupling technique that we have introduced may be regarded as a crude way of modelling a multi - phase fluid in cosmological simulations and seems to produce much better results than standard sph .",
    "this decoupling seems a reasonable approximation when the disk is self - gravitating and consists of cold gas and stars .",
    "as the multi - phase structure of the interstellar medium begins to be resolved in a simulation , this approximation must break down since the external pressure from halo gas plays a role in confining the hot phase of the interstellar medium . modelling these processes",

    "<S> we investigate the evolution of angular momentum in smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations of galaxy formation , paying particular attention to artificial numerical effects . we find that a cold gas disc forming in an ambient hot gas halo receives a strong hydrodynamic torque from the hot gas . by splitting the hydrodynamic force into artificial viscosity and pressure gradients , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the angular momentum transport is caused not by the artificial viscosity but by the pressure gradients . using simple test simulations of shear flows , we conclude that the pressure gradient - based viscosity can be divided into two components : one due to the noisiness of sph and the other to ram pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the former is problematic even with very high resolution because increasing resolution does not reduce the noisiness . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the ram pressure effect appears only when a cold gas disc or sheet does not contain enough particles . in such a case , holes form in the disc or sheet , and then ram pressure from intra - hole hot gas , causes significant deceleration . in simulations of galactic disc formation , star formation usually decreases the number of cold gas particles , and hole formation leads to the fragmentation of the disc . </S>",
    "<S> this fragmentation not only induces further angular momentum transport , but also affects star formation in the disc . to circumvent these problem </S>",
    "<S> , we modify the sph algorithm , decoupling the cold from the hot gas phases , i.e. inhibiting the hydrodynamic interaction between cold and hot particles . </S>",
    "<S> this , a crude modelling of a multi - phase fluid in sph cosmological simulations , leads to the formation of smooth extended cold gas discs and to better numerical convergence . </S>",
    "<S> the decoupling is applicable in so far as the self - gravitating gas disc with negligible external pressure is a good approximation for a cold gas disc .    </S>",
