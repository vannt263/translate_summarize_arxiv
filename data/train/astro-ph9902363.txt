    "molecular species are useful diagnostics for understanding the physics and chemistry of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and have been studied in various ways for many years .",
    "most molecules are observed in dense molecular clouds via rotational emission lines in the radio band .",
    "these emission studies are indispensable to our understanding of galactic ecology and the ism : they yield maps of dense regions , have very high spectral ( velocity ) resolution , and allow us to study complex molecules not otherwise observable .",
    "there are some drawbacks to molecular emission studies , however .",
    "first , analysis of the line excitation is very model - dependent and can lead to significant systematic errors .",
    "second , since spatial resolution is typically low ( and varies from species to species ) , it is sometimes hard to discern whether emission from different species comes from the same location within a cloud .",
    "this makes comparisons among species difficult .",
    "molecular absorption line observations have some important advantages over emission line studies .",
    "first , absorption from different species observed in the same line of sight are more likely to coexist spatially , thus reducing geometrical ambiguities and allowing more reliable inter - species comparisons .",
    "second , because the unexcited molecules are observed directly , column density determinations are not as model - dependent as for emission studies , and hence more accurate .",
    "third , some molecular species ( notably h@xmath0 and c@xmath0 ) are essentially unobservable in the radio due to lack of a dipole moment .",
    "these species can sometimes be observed via electronic transitions in the ultraviolet ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or through rotational - vibrational transitions in the visible or infrared ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . and finally , molecular abundances derived from absorption measures can easily be compared to line - of - sight bulk properties ( e.g. , extinction , polarization , and atomic abundances ) which are also derived from absorption measures .",
    "co and c@xmath0  have transitions at 2.3 @xmath2 m and 8775  , respectively , which can be observed in absorption .",
    "the primary drawback to studying molecular absorption lines in the infrared ( ir ) is finding a suitable background star .",
    "the target must be bright in the ir yet fortuitously placed behind a substantial amount of absorbing material .    in our effort to find background sources for absorption line studies in regions also accessible to emission - line studies ,",
    "we have selected the target w40 irs 1a , an ob star embedded within the radio source w40 .",
    "this source appears well - suited for our purposes ; though dim in the visible ( @xmath11 ) it is bright in the ir ( @xmath12 ) , and lies behind about 9 magnitudes of extinction in @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "w40 itself is a blister - type region breaking out of a local molecular cloud , about 400 pc away towards the galactic center ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a group of hot stars ( most likely b - class ) is bathing the region with ionizing radiation ; w40 irs 2a ( os 2a ) seems to be producing most of the energy ( @xcite ) .",
    "irs 1a is brighter than 2a in the optical and near - ir indicating somewhat greater extinction toward irs 2a .",
    "crutcher and chu ( 1982 ) mapped @xmath1co and @xmath15co , hco@xmath16 , hcn and h@xmath17 emission toward w40 , generating a comprehensive kinematic interpretation of the region .",
    "valle et al .",
    "( 1987 , 1991 , 1992 , and 1994 ) have done extensive studies on the properties of the molecular cloud and its interaction with the region using recombination lines , radio continuum emission , and co emission . the existence of circumstellar dust shells around w40 irs 1a , 2a and 3a ( @xmath18 k and @xmath19 ) has been suggested based on broad - band ir imaging and continuum measurements in the millimeter and sub - millimeter ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "both co and c@xmath0  are important interstellar molecules .",
    "co is the most abundant molecule in the ism after molecular hydrogen , and has a number of important roles : the co emission lines at 2.6 mm and shorter are not only responsible for cooling molecular clouds but also serve as tracers for h@xmath0 and dense molecular gas ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . c@xmath0  is much less abundant than co and has been observed primarily in diffuse and translucent clouds ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . like h@xmath0 , c@xmath0 has no dipole moment and hence no pure rotational spectrum .",
    "it is a very useful diagnostic of cloud physical conditions such as kinetic temperature , density , and radiation field intensity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . both co and",
    "c@xmath0  are important to carbon chemistry everywhere in the ism .    co absorption at 2.3 @xmath2 m ( @xmath20 ) has not been observed as frequently as the v = 1 - 0 band at 4.7 @xmath2 m , most likely owing to the smaller transition probabilities .",
    "it is , however , easier to observe at 2.3 @xmath2 m since the thermal background from the earth s atmosphere is much lower than at 4.7 @xmath2 m .",
    "black and willner ( 1984 ) and black et al .",
    "( 1990 ) used the lines at 2.3 @xmath2 m to study the physical conditions and chemistry toward ngc 2024 , ngc 2264 and afgl 2591 . recently , lacy et al .",
    "( 1994 ) were able to observe both co and h@xmath0 absorption near 2.3 @xmath2 m toward ngc 2024 irs 2 yielding for the first time a direct measure of the h@xmath0/co ratio in a molecular cloud .",
    "absorption lines of c@xmath0  have been used to address a number of problems in the ism , including : diffuse interstellar cloud chemistry ( e.g. @xcite ) , carbon chemistry in translucent clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) , molecular cloud envelopes ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the line of sight structure toward @xmath21 oph ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "federman et al . ( 1994 ) provide a good compilation of c@xmath0  measurements up to 1992 .",
    "in this paper we report on absorption - line studies of co and c@xmath0  toward w40 irs 1a .",
    "the line of sight is discussed in the next section . in section 3",
    "we describe our observations and the results , and in section 4 we discuss their implication for the physical state of the material in this line of sight .",
    "the final section contains a brief summary of our conclusions .",
    "very little is known about the interstellar sightline to w40 irs 1a .",
    "both crutcher and chu ( 1982 ) and smith et al .",
    "( 1985 ) infer @xmath22 .",
    "the average extinction due to diffuse material over 400 pc is about 0.6 mag ( see @xcite , p. 155 ) .",
    "therefore the obscuring material is most likely local to the w40 region and more dense than the diffuse ism .",
    "in addition , crutcher and chu ( 1982 ) found a molecular @xmath15co  component in front of the w40 region with @xmath23 km s@xmath24 , @xmath25 @xmath5 , and @xmath26 , further suggesting that the sightline passes through cold material , most likely associated with the neighboring molecular cloud .    the line of sight intersects at least 3 distinct physical regimes .",
    "as noted above there appears to be some cold foreground material , perhaps associated with the nearby molecular cloud .",
    "closer to w40 irs 1a there must be a photon - dominated region ( pdr ) , and closer still , the w40 region itself . if w40 irs 1a  has a circumstellar dust shell , it is not clear what its effect on the co and c@xmath0  spectra might be . a warm dust shell",
    "might be associated with an elevated gas temperature , and hence the appearance of high-@xmath27 molecular rotational lines .",
    "the region is roughly 0.9 pc across and has an electron density of 200 @xmath9 ( based on results in crutcher and chu [ 1982 ] and a distance of 400 pc ) . the column density of ionized hydrogen associated with the region should be about @xmath28 @xmath5 , assuming spherical geometry and that all hydrogen is ionized . using the relation of total hydrogen column density to extinction found in bohlin , savage , & drake ( 1978 ) , the region should contribute @xmath29 mag to the line - of - sight extinction .",
    "this , of course , assumes a standard gas - to - dust ratio , which may not apply to regions in general .",
    "the contribution to @xmath14  could increase or decrease depending primarily on the nature of any grain - destroying shocks which may have passed through the region . in either case",
    ", the region probably does not strongly contribute to the total extinction on the line of sight to w40 irs 1a .",
    "in addition , molecules like co and c@xmath0  can not survive in the harsh environment , so the region should not contribute to the line - absorption for these molecules either .",
    "there is almost surely a photon - dominated region ( pdr ) on the line of sight to w40 irs 1a , which could account for as much as @xmath30 , nearly the entire measured visual extinction ( see @xcite for a good discussion ) .",
    "hydrogen is expected to be neutral or molecular throughout the pdr .",
    "co and perhaps c@xmath0  can not survive in the regions of the pdr closest to the region .",
    "the effect of dust in pdrs is poorly understood , and so a quantitative treatment of these regions in general is difficult .    in summary ,",
    "co and c@xmath0  absorption lines should sample the cold material in the foreground , at least part of the pdr , and none of the region . a circumstellar dust shell ,",
    "if it exists , would most likely only contribute to high-@xmath27 molecular absorption .",
    "the visual extinction ( @xmath31 ) should arise almost entirely in the foreground material ( which may be part of the local molecular cloud ) and the pdr , though we note that the pdr could in theory produce all of the observed extinction .",
    "the observations of w40 irs 1a  were obtained with the cassegrain echelle spectrograph and the rca ccd camera on the 4-m mayall telescope at kitt peak national observatory on the night of ut 16 june 1983 .",
    "two spectra , each of one hour s duration , were recorded in the region of the 2 - 0 band of the phillips system ( a@xmath32  x@xmath33 ) of c@xmath0 .",
    "the entire 2 - 0 band was contained in a single order with its center near 8775   and with a nominal reciprocal dispersion of 0.074   per pixel at the face of the ccd chip .",
    "quartz lamp and thorium - argon spectra were obtained for flat - fielding and wavelength calibration .",
    "an 84 @xmath2 m wide slit was employed , providing a nominal resolution of 0.15   which in turn corresponds to approximately 2 pixels on the chip .",
    "the two consecutive one - hour frames were co - added and averaged . similarly , two separate flat - field frames were co - added and averaged , and the result was divided into the averaged stellar frame to produce the final photometric spectrum . both flat - field and stellar frames were bias - corrected .",
    "the average of fifteen bias frames was first subtracted from the flat - field and stellar frames , after which a second - order bias correction was accomplished by subtracting from the average stellar and flat - field frames the mean row biases obtained from the masked bias columns of each .",
    "the final spectrum was extracted by collapsing the three columns along the slit direction which contained the maximum signal .",
    "this spectrum is shown in figure 1 .",
    "spikes are due to cosmic ray hits and possibly oh airglow lines .",
    "rotational lines in all three branches ( p , q and r ) were identified , with the rotational quantum number @xmath27 reaching as high as 12 for the q - branch . unfortunately , there were problems with the wavelength calibration at the telescope and we were not able to derive a precise measure for the radial velocities of the c@xmath0  lines .",
    "equivalent widths for these lines were determined using standard spectral reduction procedures in the noao / iraf package , and column densities for each of the rotational levels were calculated from the rotational lines using a simple gaussian curve - of - growth ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . initially , the @xmath34-value derived by erman et al . ( 1982 ) was used .",
    "recently , the phillips system transition probabilities have been refined ( see @xcite and references therein ) and the column densities have been adjusted to reflect the new @xmath34-value derived by lambert , sheffer , and federman ( 1995 ) , @xmath35 .",
    "the data for each line and the column densities for each @xmath27 are shown in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "several of the lines exhibited effects of saturation , and an estimate of the doppler constant ( @xmath36 ) was derived by requiring that rotational lines originating from the same rotational energy level yield the same rotational population for that level .",
    "this method is a simple extension of the doublet ratio method used in the analysis of saturated atomic species .",
    "the best value for the doppler constant was found to be 1.25 km s@xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath37 data are not included due to high uncertainty : only the q12 line was observed and it is very weak .      the @xmath38 rotational - vibrational lines for co fall near 2.3 @xmath2 m , within the k band . since the oscillator strengths are smaller , the @xmath38 lines are not as saturated as their @xmath39 cousins at 4.7 @xmath2 m .",
    "in addition , it is somewhat easier to observe at 2.3 @xmath2 m , as the sky emission at 4.7 @xmath2 m is much greater and more problematic .",
    "contamination from stellar co absorption should be negligible since w40 irs 1a  appears to be a hot o or b star , which would not allow stellar co to survive ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "circumstellar gas and dust , if it exists , could affect the high-@xmath27 molecular levels .",
    "ro - vib transitions at 2.3 @xmath2 m for @xmath1co  were observed ut 11 june 1994 and ut 21 july 1997 using the cshell ir spectrometer at nasas infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) on mauna kea .",
    "the irtf is a 3 meter primary , off - axis cassegrain yielding f/13.67 at the spectrometer slit .",
    "the cshell is a cryogenically cooled echelle spectrometer with a 256 x 256 sbrc insb detector array ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used the 0.5  slit which gives @xmath40 .",
    "only the r0 , 1 , and 2 transitions were detected ( figure 3 ) with upper limits placed on r3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "a summary of the observations is shown in table 3 .",
    "the data were obtained and reduced following typical ir observing procedures which we briefly summarize below .",
    "dark frames were coadded and subtracted from the flat - field image for each wavelength setting .",
    "w40 irs 1a  and the standard stars were observed in both the `` a '' and `` b '' beams ( each beam places the spectrum in a different spatial location on the detector ) .",
    "beam differences ( a - b and b - a ) were calculated to eliminate sky emission , then coadded and normalized using the flat field for the appropriate wavelength setting .",
    "wavelength calibration was achieved using ar , kr , and xe lamps with 3 lines per wavelength setting .",
    "one dimensional spectra for w40 irs 1a , the standard stars , and the calibration lamps were then extracted from the detector images using the apall task in iraf .",
    "once the wavelength solution was applied , telluric absorption features were identified in both the standard stars and w40 irs 1a  spectra .",
    "telluric lines were eliminated from the w40 irs 1a  spectra using the iraf task telluric , which shifts and scales the standard star spectrum before dividing into the object spectrum .",
    "it is important to note that merely dividing the standard star spectrum into the object spectrum does not produce the _ true _ object spectrum without telluric features . to properly remove telluric features",
    ", one must generate an _ expected _ object spectrum , convolve it with the standard star spectrum , and compare to the actual observed object spectrum .",
    "lacy et al .",
    "( 1994 ) give a good discussion of this technique .",
    "we opted to merely divide , however , as our data quality did not warrant more sophisticated techniques .",
    "the r0 , 1 , and 2 lines are shown in figure 3 .",
    "these lines imply @xmath41 km s@xmath24 , in contrast with the 8 km s@xmath24 foreground molecular material seen in emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "since emission line data sample a large , beam - averaged area , and absorption lines just a pencil beam , we do not necessarily expect velocities derived from both to agree .",
    "we merely note that they are not wildly different .",
    "@xmath42 corresponds to a resolution of @xmath43 km s@xmath24 .",
    "the r0 , 1 , and 2 lines all have fwhm @xmath44 km s@xmath24 and hence are not well - resolved . after continuum normalization ,",
    "each line was directly integrated for equivalent width .",
    "errors reflect continuum placement ambiguity and are of high confidence ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "all the widths ( along with transition information and errors ) are given in table 4 .",
    "widths for the r3 , r4 and r5 lines are 2@xmath46 upper limits based on the noise in the continuum at the expected line position .",
    "the equivalent width of any absorption line is dependent on the column density of the species and , if saturated , the velocity parameter _",
    "@xcite ) . we generated a model curve of growth ( cog ) using @xmath47 km s@xmath24 , as determined from the c@xmath0 lines .",
    "each @xmath1co  equivalent width was fit to the cog independently and the column density for each rotational level ( @xmath48 ) is given in table 5 .",
    "the r2 through r5 lines were clearly optically thin while the r0 and r1 lines were more optically thick , falling on the transition from the linear portion to the saturated part of the cog .",
    "if the @xmath36-value for co is greater than 1.25 km s@xmath24 , then the r0 and r1 lines become more optically thin and their abundances drop by 2 and 0.5 @xmath49 @xmath5 respectively . summing the abundances for each line",
    "gives a total column density of @xmath50 @xmath5 ( assuming @xmath1co to be the dominant isotope ) .",
    "depending on the excitation of the higher @xmath27 levels , this value could be slightly too small , and if @xmath51 km s@xmath24 , then it would be too high .",
    "our column density for co is nearly identical to that inferred by crutcher & chu ( 1982 ) for the foreground , @xmath52 @xmath5 .      in an effort to detect the co ice band at 4.7  we made observations with moderate spectral resolution at the united kingdom ir telescope ( ukirt ) using the cgs4 on 19 august 1998 .",
    "all observations were carried out while nodding along the slit to remove atmospheric emission .",
    "the total integration time on w40 irs 1a  was 11.2 minutes at an average airmass of 1.45 .",
    "the spectrum for w40 irs 1a  was ratioed by bs 7236 ( b9v ) to remove telluric absorption features .",
    "the s / n is @xmath53 at 4.67  and no co ice feature is apparent .",
    "an upper limit for the optical depth of the band is @xmath54 ( 2@xmath46 ) , implying @xmath55 @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the depletion of co into icy mantles for the w40 irs 1a  sightline must be less than 1 % .",
    "we have three basic diagnostics for the temperature and density toward w40 irs 1a .",
    "the @xmath15co emission data imply @xmath56 , much lower than the nearby molecular cloud , @xmath57 ( @xcite ) .",
    "excitation conditions can also be derived from the rotational populations of co and c@xmath0 .",
    "the rotational level populations of the c@xmath0  phillips system ( @xmath58 ) are attained via radiative pumping .",
    "lifetimes of these levels are so long that collisions and upward electronic transitions are the most important depopulation mechanisms . hence the rotational populations reflect the competition between pumping and collisions and are non - thermal in general ( @xcite ) . for densities greater than @xmath59 @xmath9 the @xmath60 and @xmath61 levels",
    "are very nearly thermal .",
    "otherwise , the populations depend on the thermal temperature , @xmath62 , and the radiation parameter , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the collision partner density ( usually @xmath65h@xmath66h@xmath67 ) , @xmath46 is the effective cross section for collisional de - excitation , and @xmath68 is the scaling factor for the radiation field in the far - red ( @xcite ) .    total molecular abundance and excitation temperatures were calculated from models which fit a maxwell - boltzmann population distribution to the observed rotational level abundances . as had been found for other relatively dense clouds ( @xcite ) , the rotational abundances could not be fit with a single temperature distribution , presumably as a result of radiative pumping ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , we fit these data with a two - temperature model used by lutz and crutcher ( 1983 ) : j - levels 4 through 10 were fit with an excitation temperature ( @xmath69 ) of 126 k , which we associate with the effects of radiative pumping . after correcting the populations in j = 0 and 2 for the contributions from the 126 k population distribution , we derived a j=2/j=0 excitation temperature of 39 k , which we associate with the thermal distribution of the gas .",
    "the resulting total column density of c@xmath0  towards w40 irs 1a  is @xmath70 @xmath5 , based on a boltzmann distribution for both temperatures .",
    "this is the highest column density of c@xmath0  yet seen in absorption .",
    "figure 2 shows the final fits .    in comparing the results for w40 irs 1a  to the radiative pumping models calculated by van dishoeck ( 1984 ) , we found that they are best characterized by her model with a kinetic temperature of 40 k and a radiation parameter , @xmath63 of @xmath71 .",
    "assuming @xmath72 , @xmath73 @xmath74 ( @xcite ) , and that hydrogen ( + h@xmath0 ) is the only important collision partner , we get @xmath75 @xmath9 for the w40 irs 1asightline .",
    "since the value of @xmath46 is not known to better than a factor of 2 ( @xcite ) , our value for @xmath76 is equally imprecise .",
    "in addition , for an enhanced ( or depleted ) radiation field , the estimated collision ( hydrogen ) density would scale accordingly .",
    "rotational transitions of co are primarily excited by collisions with hydrogen .",
    "de - excitation can occur via collisions with hydrogen or by spontaneous line emission .",
    "the critical density at which collisions begin to overtake spontaneous emission is around 3000 @xmath9 .",
    "more detailed studies of the excitation , photodissociation , and chemistry have been conducted by van dishoeck & black ( 1988 ) and warin , benayoun , & viala ( 1996 ) .",
    "in general it is found that the rotational populations of co are sub - thermal except for the first few levels in dense cases ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence the assumption of lte will almost always produce excitation temperatures which underestimate the actual thermal temperature ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "recent work by wannier , penprase , & andersson ( 1997 ) suggests that the dominant form of co excitation in diffuse and translucent clouds can be line emission from nearby molecular clouds , if the clouds have similar velocity vectors .    as a start",
    ", we constructed a boltzmann plot for the @xmath1co  data ( figure 4 ) .",
    "fitting the temperature to all lines gives @xmath78 k. this value is similar to that found by cruther & chu ( 1982 ) , but it is important to note that the excitation temperatures for @xmath15co  and @xmath1co  are different in general ( @xcite ) . since the thermal temperature is greater than the co rotational temperature in general , @xmath6 k , which is consistent with the c@xmath0  analysis .",
    "warin , benayoun , & viala ( 1996 ) have constructed models of co excitation for the dense , translucent , and diffuse cloud regimes , including uv photodissociation .",
    "these models show very clearly that the excitation temperature is much lower than the thermal temperature for diffuse and translucent clouds .",
    "the excitation of co in dense clouds is nearly thermal and @xmath79 .",
    "if we assume that the cloud(s ) toward w40 irs 1a  are dense , then @xmath80 k. for diffuse and translucent clouds , the level populations observed can be scaled ( see section 4.2 of warin , benayoun , & viala [ 1996 ] ) to derive `` pseudo - lte '' rotational populations , i.e. representative lte populations for the actual thermal temperature of the gas .",
    "a slope can be fitted to these populations and a thermal temperature inferred .",
    "if the cloud(s ) toward w40 irs 1a  are translucent , then the r0 population is reduced by @xmath81 ( changes in r1 and r2 happen to be negligible ) .",
    "the resulting populations imply @xmath82 k ( see figure 4 ) , which still does not agree with the c@xmath0  analysis .",
    "it is not clear , however , that the models constructed by warin , benayoun , & viala ( 1996 ) apply to our line of sight : the uv field is probably higher than normal near w40 , and it seems very likely that there are multiple clouds on the sightline .",
    "since the cloud(s ) on the w40 irs 1a  line of sight are very near the w40 molecular cloud , and the lsr velocities of both are similar ( 5 and 8 km s@xmath24 ) , the excitation for @xmath1co  may be at least partially radiative . comparing to models constructed by wannier , penprase , & andersson ( 1997 )",
    "it is apparent that our @xmath78 k is degenerate : it can be accounted for by many combinations of radiative excitation , collision partner density , and kinetic temperature . the c@xmath0  excitation conditions can help constrain those for @xmath1co . if we assume @xmath83 k , the density of the gas can range from 0 to 450 @xmath9 , depending on the efficiency of radiative excitation .",
    "collisional excitation becomes dominant as @xmath84 approaches 450 @xmath9 ( which we use as an upper limit ) .",
    "if we further assume @xmath8 @xmath9 ( as indicated by the c@xmath0  data ) , then the excitation of co can only be explained by collisional and radiative processes combined",
    ".    a summary of the w40 irs 1a  sightline cloud physical properties based on the co and c@xmath0  data in this paper as well as the co emission study by crutcher and chu ( 1982 ) is given in table 6 .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , we assume that nearly all of the absorption on this line of sight arises in one cloud complex ( single or multiple components ) local to the w40 region , since it is only 400 pc distant ( i.e. , the cloud(s ) can not be diffuse ) .",
    "the physical conditions are best determined by c@xmath0 : @xmath85 @xmath9 and @xmath86 k. the co emission and absorption values and limits agree very well .",
    "the cloud(s ) are clearly not dense enough to be considered molecular , but could be considered translucent .",
    "translucent lines of sight typically have @xmath87 and can be studied via both absorption lines ( uv , optical , and/or ir ) , and radio emission lines .",
    "in addition , translucent material is expected in the outer envelopes of molecular clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "we postulate that the w40 irs 1a  sightline is composed of multiple translucent components associated with the w40 molecular cloud .",
    "co and c@xmath0  abundances have been determined jointly for a number of sightlines , a sample of which is shown in table 7 .",
    "w40 irs 1a  is one of few sightlines allowing a direct comparison of co and c@xmath0  in _ absorption_. the abundance ratio we derive is co / c@xmath0  @xmath88 ( 2@xmath46 ) .",
    "the depletion of co onto dust is negligible ( @xmath89 ) , in view of our failure to detect co ice , but the c@xmath0depletion has not been assessed .",
    "note that the co / c@xmath0  ratio increases from diffuse to translucent and molecular regimes indicating ( to first order ) that the formation / destruction rates favor co over c@xmath0as cloud type changes . this may merely be due to self - shielding of co , but other processes may also be in action : the data are not yet precise enough to tell .    assuming all hydrogen is molecular ,",
    "we can estimate the amount of h@xmath0 on the w40 irs 1a  line of sight from @xmath3 .",
    "using an h@xmath0/co ratio of @xmath90 ( based on the direct comparison of h@xmath0 and co ir absorption lines toward ngc 2024 irs 2 ( @xmath91 ) , @xcite ) , we find @xmath92 @xmath5 .",

    "the ratio of visual to selective extinction , @xmath94 , is a grain size distribution indicator ( @xcite ) : @xmath95 implies an abundance of small grains compared to the typical size distribution , whereas @xmath96 implies that larger grains dominate the extinction .",
    "as interstellar clouds collapse the dust grains tend to agglomerate , eliminating the smaller particles ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the line of sight toward w40 irs 1a  does indeed sample the edge of a molecular cloud , then we would expect a population of larger grains and @xmath97 .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 1985 ) found @xmath98 = 2.2 for w40 irs 1a  and assuming it is an ob star , @xmath99 .",
    "for @xmath100 , we get a range in @xmath14  of 7.5 to 12.5 , which agrees with the previous work by crutcher and chu ( 1982 ) and smith et al .",
    "( 1985 ) .    our calculated value of @xmath14  can be used to predict the amount of co expected toward w40 irs 1a . as discussed in section 2 ,",
    "however , the extinction and co absorption may not be well - correlated in the pdr , leading us to slightly _ overestimate _",
    "@xmath3 based on @xmath14 .",
    "conversely , most studies of the co/@xmath14  ratio have not addressed the depletion of co into ice mantles ( which may be as high as 40 % , @xcite ) . since co is almost entirely in the gas - phase for the w40 irs 1a  line of sight",
    ", these studies will _ underestimate _ the predicted co column density . using radio maps , spectroscopic data , and star counts in the taurus and @xmath101 oph clouds , frerking , langer , and wilson ( 1982 ) found : @xmath102 for @xmath103 in @xmath5 and @xmath104 .",
    "this relation predicts @xmath105 @xmath5 ( with @xmath106co@xmath107c@xmath108o@xmath109 ) for our line of sight , very nearly the same as we have measured .",
    "interestingly , it may be that the pdr effect nearly balances the depletion effect .",
    "there is no strong correlation between c@xmath0  and @xmath110 ( @xcite ) though other dust indicators have not been investigated .",
    "the lack of correlation may be due to the fact that many of the stars included in c@xmath0  absorption studies to date have been distant supergiants where some of the sightline extinction is caused by diffuse clouds , which lack abundant c@xmath0 .    comparing the w40 irs 1a  sightline to others in table 7 , it is apparent that co and c@xmath0  generally increase with @xmath14 but the data are too scattered to draw any strong conclusions .    the measurement of co and c@xmath0  absorption toward cyg ob2",
    "12 , the classic diffuse cloud line of sight with @xmath111 , is quite interesting .",
    "lutz and crutcher ( 1983 ) found @xmath112 @xmath5 ( adjusted for new phillips system @xmath34-values in lambert , sheffer , and federman ( 1995 ) ) , about half of the abundance on the w40 irs 1a  sightline .",
    "recently , mccall et al . (",
    "1998 ) measured co ir absorption toward cyg ob2 no .",
    "12 yielding @xmath113 @xmath5 , a factor of 60 less than what we find for w40 irs 1a  over nearly the same total visual extinction .",
    "the 4.7 @xmath2 m co ice feature is not seen on this line of sight ; therefore , depletion of co onto ice mantles can not readily explain the discrepancy .",
    "this clearly shows that the gaseous co to dust ratio changes from diffuse to denser environments .    as an interesting side note ,",
    "we have compared the total hydrogen column density ( assuming all of it to be molecular ) for both w40 irs 1a  and ngc 2024 irs 2 to the hydrogen / reddening correlations found by bohlin , savage , and drake ( 1978 ) and dickman ( 1978 ) ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the @xmath110 for ngc 2024 irs 2 assumes @xmath114 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and @xmath94 ranging from 3 to 5 .",
    "the correlations ( `` intercloud '' and `` cloud '' ) from bohlin , savage , and drake ( 1978 ) are based on l@xmath17 absorption for lightly reddened sightlines with @xmath115 , while the relation from dickman ( 1978 ) , derived from co emission , is good to @xmath116 . in figure 5",
    "we have extrapolated out to @xmath117 .",
    "the data from w40 irs 1a  and ngc 2024 irs2 agree with the extrapolated relations surprisingly well , within factors of 2 or so .",
    "we have used @xmath1co  and c@xmath0  ir and visible absorption lines to investigate the line of sight toward w40 irs 1a .",
    "the c@xmath0  data were obtained at the 4 m mayall telescope at kpno and the @xmath1co  data from the cshell on the irtf .",
    "the co ice band at 4.7 was not detected .",
    "this sightline is clearly much more dense than diffuse , based on @xmath22 and a distance of only 400 pc ( we calculate a range in @xmath14  of 7.5 to 12.5 , assuming a population of large grains ) .",
    "our @xmath1co  and c@xmath0  data show :    \\1 . the c@xmath0  excitation conditions , @xmath86 k and @xmath8 @xmath9 , agree with limits determined from co emission and absorption .",
    "since the @xmath14  is large and both absorption and emission measures are available , we postulate that the w40 irs 1asightline has multiple translucent components .",
    "\\3 . comparing to other sightlines in table 7 , we find an overall increase in @xmath3 and @xmath118 with increasing @xmath14 . the data , however , are too scattered to draw any further conclusions at this point",
    ". the ratio of co to c@xmath0  appears to increase from diffuse to translucent and molecular sightlines probably due to the self - shielding of co.    \\4 .",
    "the column density of co toward w40 irs 1a  is @xmath119 times that found for cyg ob2 no .",
    "12 , the classic diffuse line of sight ( @xcite ) , despite very similar @xmath14  values .",
    "this is not a depletion effect , and suggests that the co - to - dust ratio changes from diffuse to dense environments .",
    "finally , the relationship of hydrogen column density to interstellar reddening ( @xcite ; @xcite ) was found to be roughly consistent with recent data out to @xmath120 ( figure 5 ) .",
    "contrary to the co - to - dust ratio , the hydrogen - to - dust ratio appears to be valid from diffuse to dense regimes .",
