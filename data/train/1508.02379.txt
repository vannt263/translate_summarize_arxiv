    "analyzing the quantum harmonic oscillator  or more generally any polynomial hamiltonian quadratic in @xmath15 and @xmath16 with time - dependent coefficients  is about as old as quantum mechanics itself . a recent broad approach @xcite summarizes and develops an analysis based on dynamical invariants @xcite to calculate the time evolution of wave functions .",

    ", the association of an operator , @xmath17 with a function on the phase plane can take many forms @xcite , but the commonest , and in many ways the simplest , is that of wigner and of weyl @xcite .",
    "this paper utilizes _ only _ the wigner - weyl correspondence . the density matrix @xmath2 and phase operator @xmath18 ( see reference @xcite ) are well - defined quantum mechanical objects with the correspondences @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the time - dependent wigner function and @xmath7 is effectively the polar angle in the phase plane @xmath22 . here",
    "i mostly consider the time dependence of operators related to the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator under the influence of a time - dependent force or when its frequency is time - dependent .",
    "the general hamiltonian for these cases is @xmath23 a great advantage of using the wigner - weyl phase space formulation for the oscillator is that when the quantum mechanics is ` unwrapped ' the dynamics is purely classical .",
    "a price to pay , however , is that to make the final result properly quantum mechanical one must perform one or more integrals over phase space .",
    "section [ wignerweyl ] reviews briefly the basic association @xmath1 .",
    "the time - dependence of @xmath24 and its application to the harmonic oscillator , equation ( [ ham1 ] ) , is discussed section [ time ] . the material in sections [ wignerweyl ] and [ time ] is not new . in section [ noiseforcing ]",

    "in particular we calculate explicitly the probability that the oscillator leaves the ground state after a time @xmath27 under the action of @xmath25 .",
    "section [ phase ] is devoted in the first instance to the time evolution of the phase angle operator @xmath18 and then , more generally , to operators @xmath28 under the influence of the stochastic force .",
    "an expression is derived for the expectation @xmath29 when the initial state is the oscillator s ground state @xmath30 .",
    "more generally it is also shown that , whatever the initial state may be , at long times , the distribution of @xmath31 is randomized with respect to the angle @xmath7 .",

    "although @xmath8 itself has a weyl transform depending on _ both _",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath10 , this expectation becomes randomized in time with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "section [ tdepfreq ] considers , approximately , two special cases of a time - dependent frequency @xmath37 , but with no other external influence . on the one hand when @xmath37 is slowly varying ( the adiabatic limit ) a simple time dependent phase shift results , generally of limited physical consequence .",
    "however , for a parametric oscillator , the frequency varies sinusoidally at about twice the oscillator s natural frequency . in that case",
    "it is shown that when the oscillator is initially in the ground state the probability of it staying there decreases , in the limit , exponentially in time .",

    "the weyl transform makes the fundamental association @xmath56 so that , sensibly , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . but",

    "the equations for classical motion are @xmath89 where @xmath90 and/or @xmath91 may depend on time .",

    "the ultimate randomizing effect of the stochastic force on the weyl quantization of the oscillator s angle @xmath324 in the phase plane , and indeed of all functions @xmath28 , is reasonable : over time , whatever its initial state @xmath32 , the distribution of angle is ` smeared ' to uniformity over the interval @xmath201 . by the same token",
    "one might expect that the same force would , in time , pump up the oscillator s energy .",
    "the quantum statement of this is given by ( [ beta ] ) , which shows , for any initial state , that large times @xmath325 or , expanding equation ( [ beta ] ) in powers of @xmath126 gives to first order , that @xmath326 where the strength of the random force is characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath327 , equation ( [ defs ] ) .",

    "but when , as for a parametric oscillator , this sinusoidal time - dependence has about twice the oscillator s natural frequency , though the perturbation may be weak , the effects are profound .",
