    "inequalities for polynomials and rational functions have rich history and numerous applications in different branches of mathematics , in particular in approximation theory ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . one of the best known inequalities is bernstein inequality for the derivative of polynomial on the interval @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "this inequality was generalized and improved in several directions , for instance , instead of one interval it was considered on compact subsets of the real line ( see @xcite , @xcite ) and on circles ( @xcite,@xcite ) , on lemniscates @xcite , on systems of jordan curves @xcite , and more recently , on analytic jordan arcs @xcite",
    ". for rational functions , bernstein type inequalities were shown for a circle @xcite , on compact subsets of the real line and circle ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . for improvements of some of such inequalities , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the mentioned above borwein - erdlyi inequality for rational functions from a circle to an arbitrary analytic jordan curve when poles are from a given compact set away from the curve .",
    "the obtained inequality is asymptotically sharp . as a consequence we get a similar estimate on an analytic arc as well .",
    "all the results are formulated in terms of normal derivatives of green functions of corresponding domains . for the necessary background on potential theory",
    ", we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the basic theme of this paper is similar to a recently developed method in @xcite , but most of the details are rather different .",
    "this approach is based on using the borwein - erdlyi inequality as a model case , estimates for green s functions , fast decreasing polynomials , gonchar - grigorjan estimate of the norm of holomorphic part of meromorphic functions , and an appropriate interpolation ; for the case of an analytic arc we apply `` open - up '' mapping ( a rational function ) .",
    "although bernstein inequality was developed to prove inverse theorems in approximation theory , we use direct approximation theorems to establish theorem [ thm : analrational ] .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section [ sec : statement ] we formulate the statements of new results , in section [ sec : proofone ] auxiliary facts are collected and the main theorem is proved , in section 4 we consider the case of one analytic arc , the last section is devoted to sharpness .",
