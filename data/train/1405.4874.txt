    "the eruptions of classical novae ( cne ) are only surpassed in luminosity by a handfull of other phenomena , such as gamma - ray bursts , supernovae ( sne ) , and some luminous blue variable stars , although in any given galaxy , nova eruptions are far more commonplace that these other transients .",
    "novae are a sub - class of the cataclysmic variables , their canonical model consisting of a white dwarf ( wd ; the primary ) which accretes material from a typically late - type , main - sequence star ( the secondary ) .",
    "mass is lost from the secondary usually via roche lobe overflow and is typically transferred to the wd by means of an accretion disk around the primary , although in a number of systems the magnetic field of the wd may significantly affect the accretion process .",
    "cn eruptions are powered by a thermonuclear runaway within the accreted material on the surface of the wd and are predicted to recur on time - scales @xmath4  years @xcite .",
    "cne are typically classified based on the properties of the eruptions ; either by the rate of decline of their optical light curve ( the speed class ; @xcite ) or via their spectroscopic behaviour ( into the sub - types of  and he / n novae ; @xcite ) .",
    "closely related to cne are the recurrent novae ( rne ) , which have been seen to have undergone more than one eruption , with observed recurrence time - scales of approximately @xmath5  years . observed rne have typically been divided into three sub - types , based not only on the properties of their eruption but also on the nature of the progenitor system .",
    "the three subclasses are rs  oph / t  crb , u  sco and t  pyx type , which harbor red giant , sub - giant and main - sequence secondaries respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "@xcite recently proposed a nova classification system that unifies cne and rne and is based only on the properties of each system at quiescence ; i.e.  the evolutionary state of the secondary star .",
    "the majority of cn systems harbor a main - sequence secondary star and define the ms - nova class ; this class also includes the t  pyx sub - class of rne .",
    "the u  sco class of rne and also cne such as gk  persei all have sub - giant secondaries and make up the sg - nova class .",
    "the third class , the rg - nova class ( also commonly referred to as symbiotic novae ) , contain nova systems with red giant secondaries , including the rs  oph / t  crb class of rne and systems such as eu  scuti .    amongst the hundreds of known galactic cne",
    ", there are only ten firmly established rne .",
    "traditionally , rne have only been confirmed by the observation of more than one eruption from the system .",
    "using multiple eruptions as the sole discriminator between rne and cne is subject to a number of significant selection effects , mainly the decreasing completeness and deepness of sky coverage as one goes back in time . as such",
    ", a galactic population of ten rne is a lower limit and clearly far from the true picture .",
    "hence , there is approximately only one confirmed galactic rn eruption each year , compared to an overall galactic nova rate of @xmath6  year@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , more indirect methods have recently been employed to introduce a small number of new candidate rn systems that have only one previous recorded eruption .",
    "these systems include v2491  cygni , kt  eridani and the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) nova m31n  2007 - 12b @xcite .",
    "these analyses include other parameters of the system , such as ejection velocity , accretion rate , wd mass , super - soft source ( sss ) behaviour , orbital period and secondary type .    from the sun s position within the milky way",
    ", our ability to study the entire nova population of the galaxy is hindered by the obscuring effect of dust in the galactic plane and large uncertainties when determining distances and extinction .",
    "as such , we have turned to the nearby galaxy m31 , which , whilst far from ideal , provides us with the best opportunity to observe the nova population of a whole galaxy .",
    "novae in m31 can all be assumed to be at the same distance , and whilst there are still dust extinction effects , these are generally much smaller than galactic extinction . with a nova rate of @xmath8 @xcite",
    ", m31 also presents us with a much larger sample size to study , compared to the @xmath9 galactic novae that are practically observable each year .    the ability to successfully detect rne in m31 using the traditional method  the observation of more than one eruption from the same system",
    " is severely hampered in a number of ways .",
    "these include ; our inability to observe m31 for several months each year ; large gaps in the observations of m31 , time between surveys , etc . ; the astrometric accuracy required to match two eruptions at the distance of m31 ; the nova distribution in m31  bulge - centric ; all of these selection effects are worse the older the data source .",
    "nonetheless , there have been a number of attempts to explore the recurrent nova population of m31 by searching for multiple eruptions at similar positions ( e.g. ; shafter et  al .  in preparation ) .",
    "however , these have all been severely limited by the large positional uncertainties of the old novae , and have only yielded a handful of rn candidates .",
    "additionally , astrometric errors can give rise to incorrect association between multiple eruptions , ( see figure  4 of * ? ? ? * for example ) .",
    "this technique is further hampered by the misidentification of long period mira variables as m31 novae ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    some of these problems can be overcome by using a spectroscopically confirmed sample of novae which all have well determined astrometric positions . but",
    "this essentially limits us only to m31 novae that have produced eruptions since around 2006 , when spectroscopy of large samples of m31 novae in eruption became viable ( see * ? ? ?",
    "based on the recurrence time - scales of their galactic counterparts , such a short baseline is not long enough to recover a good sample of rne using multiple eruptions alone .",
    "here we propose a technique that can be used to recover the progenitor systems of novae belonging to the rg - nova class ( which is dominated by confirmed and candidate rne of the rs  oph / t  crb sub - class ) from a spectroscopically confirmed sample of m31 novae . in some ( exceptional ) cases",
    "this technique may also be able to recover sg - novae in m31 ( a class dominated by rne of the u  sco sub - class ) as was recently achieved for the ( albeit much closer ) large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) rn lmcn  2009 - 02a ( bode et  al .  in preparation ) .",
    "the technique presented in this paper was also recently used to locate the progenitor system of a rn in m31 with a @xmath10  year recurrence time - scale ( , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the first optical eruption of this system , m31n  2008 - 12a , was recorded in 2008 ] , with coincident eruptions also being reported in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 @xcite . a spectrum taken after the 2012 eruption confirmed the transient to be a he /",
    "n nova in m31 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a coincident source , with only a 2.5% probability of being a chance alignment , making this system the first confirmed rn in m31 with a resolved progenitor .",
    "work by , and @xcite following the 2013 eruption has revealed that the nova system likely contains a high - mass wd and has a high accretion rate .",
    "their work also indicated the nova may have a @xmath10-year recurrence time , with further eruptions being found in 1992 , 1993 @xcite , 2001 @xcite and 2009 @xcite .",
    "m31n  2008 - 12a was not included in the survey presented here , as we did not have any eruption photometry taken prior to the end of the survey ( february 2013 ) , with the nova having faded beyond detection by the time observations were taken after the 2008 and 2012 eruptions and no observations being made after the 2011 eruption .    a number of space - based and the larger ground - based optical telescopes are capable of resolving red giant stars within m31 .",
    "as such , the progenitor systems of rg - novae can in principle be directly imaged .",
    "similar work has been used to directly image the lensed system for m31 microlensing events ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and indeed for the rn candidate m31n  2007 - 12b ( see * ? ? ? * on which this work is largely based ) , as well as the rn m31n  2008 - 12a .",
    "@xcite have also recently discussed such an approach , as have @xcite , who presented a summary of the initial results of this survey .",
    "novae are candidates for the progenitors of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "it is now widely believed that sne ia are the result of the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon - oxygen wd , but their progenitors are still uncertain .",
    "the two proposed pathways for sn ia progenitors are the single - degenerate and the double - degenerate models .",
    "the single - degenerate model involves a wd accreting matter from a less evolved secondary and increasing in mass ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "eventually the wd mass approaches the chandrasekhar mass and a sn explosion occurs when carbon ignites .",
    "one of the leading single - degenerate progenitor candidates are novae , particularly those classified as rne , due to their high wd masses and low ejecta masses . the main problem with the single - degenerate model concerns the occurrence rate of sne ia versus the population of likely progenitors ( e.g.  @xcite ) . as most wds in rn systems",
    "are generally thought to be increasing in mass with each eruption ( e.g.  @xcite ) they are prime candidates for the progenitors of sne ia .",
    "however as most cne are thought to be decreasing in mass as they undergo eruption , they are unlikely candidates for progenitors of sne ia .",
    "one of the reasons for this difference may be related to mixing between the wd material and the accreted envelope ( see e.g.@xcite for recent discussions ) .",
    "the double - degenerate model involves the merger of two wds , with their combined mass exceeding the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "there seems to be evidence supporting both of these channels and it may be the case that sne ia have more than one progenitor pathway .",
    "for example @xcite could find no resolvable companion star in the lmc sn ia remnant snr 0509@xmath1167.5 , implying this sn at least was produced by a double - degenerate system . on the other hand @xcite",
    "suggest that a single - degenerate system with a red giant companion was the progenitor of sn ptf  11kx .",
    "@xcite suggested that sn 2011fe was caused by a single - degenerate system with a main - sequence companion .",
    "@xcite showed that a system very similar to the rn rs  ophiuchi could not be the progenitor of the same sn ; however @xcite pointed out that this analysis did not exclude a less ( optically ) luminous rg - nova being the sn  ia progenitor system .",
    "the first nova progenitor system discovered in m31 was that of m31n  2007 - 12b @xcite .",
    "the current paper builds on this work , using liverpool telescope ( lt ) data to search archival _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) images for 38 quiescent m31 novae .",
    "the light curves for some m31 novae published by @xcite are also extended to include _ hst _ data taken whilst the nova was still fading .",
    "this allowed us to produce light curves that go deeper than is usually possible for extragalactic systems .",
    "additionally , from lt data , we produced a few light curves for novae that underwent eruptions in 2010 as well as updating the positions of all 38 systems .",
    "the technique employed in this paper to attempt to recover the progenitor system for each nova is that outlined in @xcite .",
    "this method relies upon accurate registration between images containing the nova in eruption and deeper ( typically archival ) high - resolution images where the system is likely to be in quiescence . for this paper",
    "we use a catalog of local group novae selected by virtue of their spectroscopic confirmation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and astrometric precision of the eruption .",
    "the input catalog of 38 novae is presented in table  [ inputcatalogue ] and their spatial distribution is shown in figure  [ spatialplot ] .",

    "although this is a small percentage of the overall galactic nova population of almost 400 @xcite , in many cases the systems have simply not been observed in quiescence .",
    "kt  eri is also believed to contain a red giant secondary , as are eu sct and v2487  ophiuchi @xcite .",
    "this suggests the rg - nova rate in the galaxy is probably higher than previously believed and there has been no study systematic enough to produce a reliable population estimate .",
    "eight of the eleven candidate progenitor systems identified by this survey have quiescent photometry in at least two bands . as such ,",
    "the positions of these systems are plotted in the color ",
    "magnitude diagrams shown in figure  [ colmag ] .",
    "inspection of this figure shows that the majority of progenitor candidates ( six of eight ) lie on or near the red giant branch .",
    "of course , it should be noted that if we had simply chosen a random sample of resolved stars in _ hst _ data of m31 then this would still be the case . the other two candidate progenitor systems ( m31n  2007 - 12a and 2010 - 09b ) both have @xmath411 .",
    "the color  magnitude diagram position of these two quiescent systems is consistent with high mass , luminous main - sequence stars .",
    "however , as is also indicated in figure  [ colmag ] , this position is similar to a pair of galactic rg - novae .",
    "these galactic novae are the suspected recurrent kt  eri , which is also likely to harbor a red giant secondary and the recurrent v2487  oph @xcite .",
    "the particularly blue color of kt  eri and v2487  oph is likely due to a bright accretion disk inclined towards the observer .",
    "this pair of m31 quiescent systems is also coincident with the color  magnitude position of a number of sg - novae or suspected sg - novae .",
    "so if we are indeed observing m31n  2007 - 12a and 2009 - 11d in quiescence they may be rg - novae with colors affected by a strong accretion disk or they may be luminous quiescent sg - novae similar to the recurrent sg - nova u  scorpii .         in figure  [ spatialcand ] , we show the spatial distribution of the novae in our survey as in figure  [ spatialplot ] , but also indicate the eleven systems with candidate progenitor systems .",
    "this shows that a much higher proportion of novae in the disk appear to have a recovered progenitor when compared to the systems in the central bulge .",
    "although increased crowding near the center of m31 ( rendering any detection less significant ) may have some influence on this , it does not seem to be the main factor .",
    "indeed , the relationship between the distance of the nearest source from the nova and the probability of a chance alignment is largely uniform for the regions of m31 studied in this work .",
    "this indicates that there may be a higher proportion of rg - novae in younger stellar populations .",
    "although of course the background light is brighter near the center of m31 and this may obscure some faint sources that would have been visible in the outer regions of the galaxy .    , the eleven novae with candidate progenitor systems are further circled .",
    "( a color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)[spatialcand ] ]    as is noted in section  [ sec : prog ] , there are problems with using the wfpc2 data . for example , as can be seen in section  [ sec : prog ] , m31n  2011 - 12a had a progenitor candidate detected that only had 3.6% probability of such an alignment occurring by chance . however , due to the relatively bright limiting magnitude of the wfpc2 data , the same detection in a typical acs / wfc image would be relatively insignificant .",
    "it could also be the case that , for a system where no candidate was detected in wfpc2 , if the same region was imaged with acs / wfc , it may reveal a coincident source .",
    "the most direct method to identify rne is to find coincident eruptions .",
    "however , due to the large population of m31 nova candidates found over the last 100 years ( over 900 ; see @xcite , and their online catalog ) many coincident sources will simply be chance alignments ( see @xcite ; shafter et  al .",
    ", in preparation )",
    ". therefore the positions we publish here may help eliminate some of the recurrent candidates that are different systems aligned by chance .",
    "there are three rn candidates in our catalog : m31n  2009 - 11b , 2010 - 10e and 2012 - 09a ( see also section  [ sec : prog ] ) .",
    "it might be expected that these novae would have a higher chance of harboring red giant secondaries , as in our galaxy half of the ten rne are rg - novae ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it can be seen in figure  [ progenitor - grid-4 ] ( top right ) that there is no resolvable source within @xmath1 of the position of m31n  2009 - 11b , although the limiting magnitude of the data is 23.8 , meaning that we can exclude a luminous red giant system ( such as one similar to rs oph ) as the progenitor , but it is possible that the system may contain a fainter red giant or sub - giant secondary .",
    "although m31n  2010 - 10e does not have a progenitor that we can locate with a high confidence , it can be seen from figure  [ progenitor - grid-6 ] ( top left ) that a red giant companion is not completely ruled out for this system .",
    "indeed there is a faint candidate within @xmath184 and a relatively bright source just outside @xmath184 .",
    "2012 - 09a does not have any sources within @xmath1 of the calculated position , although the limiting magnitudes indicate a lower - luminosity red giant or sub - giant companion may not be resolvable in the data .",
    "we can , however , all but rule out m31n  2006 - 11a , 2008 - 10b , 2009 - 08b , -11a , -11c , -11e and 2010 - 10b as rg - novae .",
    "these seven novae either had no resolved sources within @xmath1 of the eruption position or had post - eruption _ hst _ data yielding extremely precise positions . additionally , the entirety of the red giant branch was resolvable in the _ hst _ images associated with these novae .",
    "it is well worth looking in more detail at the possibility or effects of coincidental alignment .",
    "as we have already stated , the resolved stellar population in m31 that is available to _ hst _ is dominated by red giant stars , the same type of objects that we are looking for .",
    "so there is a huge potential background of `` false positives '' .",
    "however , we believe that the monte carlo technique employed to compute the probability of each alignment ( between eruption position and candidate progenitor ) occurring through chance is robust ( down to the magnitude limit stated for each nova ) .",
    "indeed the criterion of @xmath407 probability of chance alignment that we employ is fairly conservative .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the entire catalog of progenitor systems , whilst we intend to fully explore the statistics of this survey and the uncovered population in a follow - up paper ( williams et  al .  in preparation ) .",
    "however , it is worth exploring the coincidence probabilities of the population of eleven objects here in more detail .",
    "given our sample of eleven progenitor systems we can simply compute the probability that all eleven are just chance alignments .",
    "the probability that all eleven systems align as well as they do by pure chance is @xmath412 .",
    "extending this approach , the probability that exactly ten of these systems are chance alignments , but one is genuine , is @xmath413 . at the other end of the spectrum ,",
    "the probability that all eleven are genuine and there are no coincidental alignments is 0.76 .",
    "if we are concerned with @xmath414 results , then we can be confident at beyond the @xmath1 level that , at most , two of the eleven systems are chance alignments , with nine being genuine . at the @xmath415 level , we can still be confident that , at most , five are chance alignments , with the majority , six , being genuine .",
    "there is a vast array of selection effects that influenced the original input catalog , such as the luminosity of each nova , the speed class , the position in m31 , the time of year , the availability of ground - based telescopes , the availability of archival _ hst _ data , to name just a few .",
    "the full effect of these selection effects on this catalog and the significance of this result will be explored in a follow - up paper ( williams et  al .  in preparation ) .",
    "however , should these 38 nova turn out to be a fairly representative sample , then this result is extremely significant .",
    "just @xmath416 of galactic novae are known recurrent novae with red giant secondaries , another @xmath416 are rne with sub - giant secondaries .",
    "if we include all galactic novae with known evolved ( non - main - sequence ) secondaries then they account for only @xmath3 of galactic nova population . in m31",
    "we have found that 29% of our original catalog have evolved ( most likely red giant ) secondaries , or at least 24% and 16% at the 3 and @xmath415 levels respectively .",
    "such a large population of novae with evolved secondaries would have considerable impact , particularly with regards to their potential as a significant sn  ia progenitor channel .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of a survey for the progenitor system of each of a catalog of 38 spectroscopically confirmed novae in m31 .",
    "the eruption position of each nova was determined using lt data and archival _ hst _ data were used to search for the progenitors . here",
    "we summarise the main conclusions .",
    "* we have recovered a resolved , quiescent , progenitor system for eleven of the original 38 novae . for each of these systems the probability of a chance alignment",
    "is @xmath417 . *",
    "these systems are m31n  2007 - 02b , -10a , -11b , -11d , -11e , -12a , -12b , 2009 - 08a , -11d , 2010 - 01a and -09b .",
    "photometry of each of these progenitors is consistent with quiescent galactic rg - novae . *",
    "the archival data also allow us to all but rule out red giant secondaries for seven novae , m31n  2006 - 11a , 2008 - 10b , 2009 - 08b , -11a , -11c , -11e and 2010 - 10b . *",
    "although misidentification due to chance alignments is possible , we can be confident at the @xmath1 level that at least nine of the candidate progenitor systems are genuine . at the @xmath415 level this reduces to at least six .",
