    "<S> we evaluate the suppression of @xmath0 production in an equilibrating quark gluon plasma for two competing mechanisms : debye screening of colour interaction and dissociation due to energetic gluons . </S>",
    "<S> results are obtained for @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions at rhic and lhc energies . at rhic energies the gluonic dissociation of the charmonium is found to be equally important for both the systems while the screening of the interaction plays a significant role only for the larger systems . at lhc energies the debye mechanism is found to dominate for both the systems . while considering the suppression of directly produced @xmath3 at lhc energies , we find that only the gluonic dissociation mechanism comes into play for the initial conditions taken from the self screened parton cascade model in these studies . </S>",
    "<S> thus we find that a systematic study of quarkonium suppression for systems of varying dimensions can help identify the source and the extent of the suppression .    </S>",
    "<S> epsf = 0.2 in    relativistic heavy ion collision experiments at the cern sps are believed  @xcite to have led to a production of quark gluon plasma - which existed in the early universe and which may be present in the core of neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> the last two decades have seen a hectic activity towards identifying unique signatures of the quark - hadron phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of @xmath0 production in such collisions has been one of the most hotly debated signals in this connection .    </S>",
    "<S> the heavy quark pair leading to the @xmath0 mesons are produced in such collisions on a very short time - scale @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mass of the charm quark . </S>",
    "<S> the pair develops into the physical resonance over a formation time @xmath6 and traverses the plasma and ( later ) the hadronic matter before leaving the interacting system to decay ( into a dimuon ) to be detected . </S>",
    "<S> this long ` trek ' inside the interacting system is fairly ` hazardous ' for the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> even before the resonance is formed it may be absorbed by the nucleons streaming past it  @xcite . by the time the resonance is formed , </S>",
    "<S> the screening of the colour forces in the plasma may be sufficient to inhibit a binding of the @xmath7  @xcite . or an energetic gluon  @xcite or a comoving hadron  @xcite could dissociate the resonance(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> the extent of absorption will be decided by a competition between the momentum of the @xmath0 and the rate of expansion and cooling of the plasma , making it sensitive to such details as the speed of sound  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus a study of @xmath0 production is poised to provide a wealth of information about the evolution of the plasma and its properties .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown  @xcite that the nucleonic absorption ( the `` normal absorption '' ) , operating on the pre - resonance- which is yet to evolve into a physical particle- is identical for @xmath0 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this absorption is always present and is brought about by the nucleons ( or the lorentz - contracted partonic clouds ) streaming past the pre - resonances , as mentioned earlier . </S>",
    "<S> a reliable quantitative estimate within glauber model is available  @xcite for this .    in the present work we concentrate on the dissociation of the charmonium in quark gluon plasma due to colour screening and scattering with gluons and ask whether we can distinguish between the two mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that these mechanisms are in addition to nucleonic absorption mentioned earlier .    in principle </S>",
    "<S> the colour screening is a collective effect , where the presence of a large number of colour quanta modifies the force between @xmath10 and @xmath11 so that , above the critical temperature ( @xmath12 200 mev ) , we have : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( the string tension ) are phenomenological parameters and @xmath16 is the debye mass .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , e.g. , the direct production of the @xmath0 is inhibited once the debye mass is more than 0.7 gev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gluonic dissociation , on the other hand , is always possible as long as an energetic gluon can be found . </S>",
    "<S> they can always be present in the tail of the thermal distributions and thus given sufficient time , a @xmath0 can always be dissociated in a plasma of any temperature !    of - course in actual practice the qgp will expand and cool and undergo hadronization below the critical temperature @xmath17 , and thus the hot medium will have only a finite life - time . </S>",
    "<S> this enriches the competition between the mechanisms of the gluonic dissociation and the debye screening for the charmonium suppression . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> we show that this also provides us with a handle to decipher the extent to which each mechanism contributes to the suppression of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that a thermally equilibrated plasma is formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions at some time @xmath18 and that the elastic scattering among the partons is sufficiently rapid to maintain thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> a large number of studies  @xcite have indicated that the plasma thus produced may not be in a state of chemical equilibrium and that the quark and gluon fugacities are less than unity . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the chemical equilibration proceeds dominantly via @xmath19 assuming the evolution to proceed according to bjorken hydrodynamics , the evolution of the parton densities are given by@xcite : @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the expressions for the density and velocity weighted reaction rates , @xmath27 can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the results for the time evolution of the fugacities and the temperature for the initial conditions obtained from the self screened parton cascade model  @xcite for @xmath2 collisions at rhic and lhc energies are given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . for the @xmath1 collisions </S>",
    "<S> we assume that while the initial fugacities are same as those for the @xmath2 system , the initial temperatures are estimated by assuming that it scales as @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this is motivated by a recent study on the basis of parton saturation  @xcite which also suggests that the initial number density divided by @xmath29 is nearly independent of the mass - number of the nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> this , we believe , provides a useful initial guess , even though the conditions envisaged for self screening are not strictly met for @xmath1 at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> for the sake of completeness , we have given the initial conditions in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> it may be noted that these are different from those used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which were ` inspired ' by the hijing model and which had , for example , much smaller fugacities . </S>",
    "<S> ( we have verified that our computer program fully reproduced the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , with the initial conditions given there . )    </S>",
    "<S> we shall also introduce a energy density profile such that , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the transverse dimension of the system and @xmath33 is the transverse distance , and @xmath34 is the energy density obtained by taking the initial temperature as @xmath35 and fugacities as @xmath36  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the profile plays an important role in defining the boundary of the hot and dense deconfined matter .    </S>",
    "<S> having obtained the density of the partons we estimate the debye mass of the medium as @xmath37 where we have arbitrarily taken @xmath38 as 1.5 to account for the corrections  @xcite to the lowest order perturbative qcd which provides the above expression for @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> results for other values of @xmath38 are easily obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we shall assume that the @xmath0 can _ not _ be formed in the region where @xmath16 is more than 0.7 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we can then estimate the survival probability of the directly produced @xmath0 as a function of its transverse momentum @xmath40 by proceeding along the lines of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to estimate the gluonic dissociation we recall  @xcite that the short range properties of the qcd can be used to derive the gluon-@xmath0 cross - section as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the gluon energy in the rest - frame of @xmath0 and @xmath43 is the binding energy of the @xmath0 . the expression for the thermal average of this cross - section @xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> is given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( see , also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for an interesting alternative approach . )    </S>",
    "<S> we wish to have a quantitative comparison of these two processes and therefore it is imperative that we compare their results for similar conditions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , exactly as while dealing with debye screening , we assume that the @xmath7 produced intially takes a finite amount of time @xmath45 fm/@xmath10 in its rest frame to evolve into the physical resonance </S>",
    "<S> . this can get large due to time dilation , in the frame of the plasma , leading to the characteristic @xmath40 dependence of the survival probability for the @xmath0 discussed in the literature .    </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the gluon-@xmath0 cross - section also attains its full value only after the @xmath7 pair has evolved into the physical resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that this evolution of the cross - section can be parametrized as @xmath46 similarly to the case when the nuclear absorption is considered  @xcite , where @xmath47 is the cross - section estimated earlier ( eq.[sigma ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar assumption was invoked by farrar et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite when the @xmath48-system evolves as it moves away from the point of hard interaction . </S>",
    "<S> one may imagine that this amounts to assuming that the effective cross - section scales as the transverse area of the system relative to the size it attains when it is fully formed . in the present work we follow , blaizot and ollitrault  @xcite who have used @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> farrar et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have suggested that @xmath50 corresponds to a quantum diffusion of the quarks while @xmath49 would correspond to maximal rapid ( classical ) expansion . </S>",
    "<S> legrand et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have used @xmath50 in a recent study .    </S>",
    "<S> this aspect is in contrast to the work of xu et al  @xcite where a fully formed @xmath0 is assumed to exist right at the initial time in the plasma . </S>",
    "<S> we shall see that ignoring the formation time leads to an enhanced suppression of the charmonium .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now easily estimate the time spent by the @xmath0 in the deconfined medium for a given @xmath40 and get the survival probability following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in fig .  1 we show our results for rhic energies for @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the combination of a finite formation time and ( reasonably ) large @xmath16 required to inhibit the formation of the directly produced @xmath0 in the plasma ensures that the mechanism of debye screening is not effective in suppressing its production . </S>",
    "<S> however the gluonic dissociation leads to a suppression of the @xmath0 formation even after the moderating effect of the inclusion of formation time is included .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation for the larger ( and hotter ) volume of plasma produced in @xmath2 collisions is much richer in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we see that while the @xmath0s having lower transverse momenta are more strongly suppressed due to the debye mechanism , those having higher transverse momenta are more suppressed by the mechanism of gluonic dissociation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact we see that while the debye screening has become quite ineffective for @xmath516 gev , the gluonic dissociation continues to be operative . </S>",
    "<S> the different results obtained here compared to authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( when the formation time considerations are ignored ) are solely due to the sspc initial conditions ( table 1 ) used here .    </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding results at lhc energies are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> now we see that the debye screening is more effective in suppressing the production of the directly produced @xmath0 at all the momenta considered , provided we include the considerations of the formation time while evaluating the gluonic dissociation , for both the systems .    of - course in a model calculation </S>",
    "<S> one can arbitrarily enhance the impact of debye screening by taking a larger value for the coefficient @xmath38 ( eq.[mud ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this sensitivity would be useful for determining its precise value  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the treatment outlined here can be extended to the case of @xmath3 production studied in great detail by the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for example . </S>",
    "<S> we give the results only for the lhc energies , for the directly produced @xmath3 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both for the light as well as the heavy systems the debye mechanism is not at all able to inhibit the formation of the directly produced @xmath3s , though the gluonic dissociation leads to a considerable suppression , with the changes brought about by the inclusion of the formation time seen earlier for the @xmath0s . </S>",
    "<S> this is easily seen to be the consequence of the initial conditions used here , which have chemically non - equilibrated plasma leading to small debye mass , even though the temperature is rather high . by the time the @xmath3 is formed the debye mass drops below the value of @xmath52   1.6 gev , required to inhibit its formation , causing it to escape unscathed .    </S>",
    "<S> before summarizing , let us discuss some of the assumptions made in this work . </S>",
    "<S> we have , so far considered only the dissociation of the directly produced @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> of - course , it is well known that up to 30% of the @xmath0s seen in these studies may be produced from a decay of @xmath9 and up to 10% or so may come from the decay of @xmath8 , which however is also easily dissociated by a moderately hot ( confined ) hadronic matter and is unable to play a decisive role in distinguishing confined matter from a deconfined matter . in order to include the effect of these resonances </S>",
    "<S> , we should also have access to @xmath53 cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> this would involve extending the method of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to the case of charmonium in @xmath54 state . </S>",
    "<S> however this is not quite easy as the assumption @xmath55 used in the above reference are not strictly valid for this case , as the binding energy of @xmath9 is only about 240 mev .    still , from the considerations of binding energy alone </S>",
    "<S> , one may expect the @xmath53 cross - sections to be larger . </S>",
    "<S> however , the debye mass required to inhibit the formation of @xmath9 is also smaller and thus this competition between the two mechanisms will continue . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the transverse expansion and the possibility of a different speed of sound than the value of @xmath56 assumed here will also add to the richness of the information likely to be available from such studies . </S>",
    "<S> of - course a full study will additionally include the effect of the nuclear and the co - mover absorption , before these interesting details are investigated .    </S>",
    "<S> the incorporation of the formation time is interesting for one more reason . </S>",
    "<S> the pre - equilibrium stage ( before the time @xmath18 ) may be marked by presence of gluons of high transverse momenta , as a result of first hard collisions , and </S>",
    "<S> one may imagine that they play an important role in suppression of charmonium formation . </S>",
    "<S> this is unlikely for two reasons . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the gluon - charmonium cross - section drops rapidly as the gluon momentum increases  @xcite after reaching a peak around @xmath57 1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> secondly we expect these cross - sections to be further suppressed during the formation era due to the considerations of the formation time .    </S>",
    "<S> while considering the suppression of @xmath3 , we found that only the mechanism of gluonic dissociation is playing a role . </S>",
    "<S> this happens as the initial conditions used here involve a chemically non - equilibrated plasma . </S>",
    "<S> if the initial fugacities were to be larger , the debye screening would also play a role , which will definitely be a good check on these .    in brief , we have seen that while the gluonic dissociation of the @xmath0 is always possible , the debye screening is not effective in the case of small systems at rhic energies . for the larger systems , the debye screening is more effective for lower transverse momenta , while the gluonic dissociation dominates for larger transverse momenta . at lhc energies the debye screening is the dominant mechanism of @xmath0 suppression for all the cases and momenta studied . </S>",
    "<S> we have also seen that the inclusion of the formation time of the @xmath0 plays an interesting role in reducing the role of the gluonic dissociation . as an interesting result </S>",
    "<S> , we find the gluonic dissociation to be substantial but the debye screening to be ineffective for @xmath3 suppression at the lhc energy . </S>",
    "<S> this may of - course change if different initial conditions and screening criteria  @xcite are employed . </S>"
