    "blazars are variable , polarized , flat spectrum extragalactic radio sources with a non - thermal continuum extending to @xmath10-ray energies ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the radio emission from blazars is collimated into narrow beams composed of many individual knots and an optically thick core ( kellerman & pauliny - tth 1981 ) . in",
    "virtually all blazars , the radio knots appear to separate from the core at speeds greater than the speed of light ( urry & padovani 1995 ) and this superluminal motion is strong evidence that blazars are relativistic jets of magnetized plasma viewed along the jet axis ( blandford & knigl 1979 ) .",
    "although the jet model also accounts for such diverse blazar properties as the flat radio spectrum ( kellerman & pauliny - tth 1981 ) , the short variability time scales at all energies ( quirrenbach , 1991 , maraschi , 1992 ) , the small synchrotron self - compton x - ray fluxes ( marscher 1987 , ghisellini , 1992 ) and the large @xmath10-ray fluxes ( maraschi , 1992 ) , the radiative processes which produce the blazar continuum have not been identified . in this paper , we calculate the relative amplitudes of variations in the radio and x - ray fluxes for one of the most popular models of the blazar continuum , synchrotron self - compton scattering in a relativistic outflow ( jones , odell & stein 1974 , marscher 1977 , knigl 1981 , ghisellini , 1985 ) , and we compare the results to observations of correlated variations on the radio and x - ray flux from 3c279 ( grandi , etal 1995 : g95 ) .",
    "blazar spectra are nearly featureless and a large number of models , which make very different assumptions for the relevant radiation processes , agree qualitatively with snapshots of the radio to @xmath10-ray spectrum ( maraschi , 1992 , maraschi , 1994 , hartmann 1996 ) . at low energies , the flat radio spectrum of compact radio cores can be explained by inhomogeneous synchrotron emission ( marscher 1977 , knigl 1981 , ghisellini , 1985 ) or by a homogeneous core that is optically thick to induced compton scattering ( sincell & krolik 1994 : sk94 ) .",
    "the situation at high energies is even more complicated . the x- and",
    "@xmath10-ray emission may be synchrotron emission by high energy electrons ( knigl 1981 , ghisellini , 1985 ) , radiation from a pair cascade ( blandford & levinson 1995 ) or low frequency photons which are inverse compton scattered by relativistic electrons in the jet . in the last case , the source of the low energy photons could be synchrotron radiation from the jet ( the synchrotron self - compton model , maraschi 1992 , maraschi , 1994 , bloom & marscher 1996 ) , uv radiation from a disk ( dermer , schlickeiser & mastichiadis 1992 ) , or some diffuse source of radiation surrounding the jet ( sikora , begelman & rees 1994 , ghisellini & madau 1996 ) .",
    "we will consider only synchrotron self - compton scattering in this paper and ignore other sources for the high energy emission .",
    "the synchrotron self - compton model for the continuum emission assumes that a single population of relativistic electrons radiates synchrotron photons and subsequently scatters a fraction of these to higher energies ( jones , 1974 ) .",
    "fluctuations in either the electron density , the magnetic field strength or the doppler factor of the emission region will affect the synchrotron and self - compton fluxes instantaneously .",
    "therefore , variations in the low and high energy fluxes which are uncorrelated , or have significant time delays , can not be the result of synchrotron self - compton scattering .",
    "the relative amplitudes of the variations in the synchrotron and self - compton fluxes depends upon which physical parameters change .",
    "for example , the fractional change in the high energy flux is twice as large as the fractional change in the optically thin synchrotron flux when the electron density varies , whereas they are equal if the magnetic field or the doppler factor changes ( sk94 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the variations in the synchrotron and self - compton fluxes also depends upon the relativistic electron distribution .",
    "the electron spectrum will flatten with increasing radiation intensity because both the synchrotron and inverse compton cooling rates increase with increasing radiation energy density . however , these cooling processes are both too slow to have any effect upon the electron distribution in the parsec scale jet ( sk94 ) .",
    "therefore , we neglect the evolution of the electron spectrum in the calculations presented in this paper .    sk94 demonstrated that induced compton scattering can reduce the amplitudes of variations in the synchrotron radiation when the brightness temperature of the source @xmath11 .",
    "the amplitudes of variations in the self - compton x - ray flux are unaffected by induced compton scattering because the x - ray flux is dominated by photons scattered from the high - frequency , low @xmath12 , end of the synchrotron spectrum , where the stimulated scattering optical depth is small .",
    "thus , the relative amplitudes of the variations in the synchrotron flux at the self - absorption turnover frequency and the self - compton flux at 1 kev are reduced from @xmath13 to @xmath14 when the induced compton scattering optical depth is large ( sk94 ) .    the continuum emission from 3c279 , one of the most intensively monitored blazars , varies coherently over its entire spectrum ( maraschi , 1992 , maraschi 1994 , hartmann , 1996 ) .",
    "recently , g95 used historical light curves to show that the radio - mm and 1 kev x - ray fluxes from 3c279 are strongly correlated .",
    "the maximum time resolution of the 3c279 light curves was @xmath15 and the absence of any detectable time delay implies that the radio - mm and x - ray fluxes are from physically related regions separated by @xmath16 . while this is consistent with the assumptions of the synchrotron self - compton theory , the relative amplitudes of the radio and x - ray variations are smaller than predicted ( sincell 1996 ) .    in this paper , we extend previous calculations ( sk94 , sincell 1996 ) and compute the relative amplitudes of variations in the synchrotron self - compton flux as a function of the frequency of the synchrotron emission .",
    "we first define the flux variability ratio (  [ sec : flux variability ratio ] ) and describe how it is calculated .",
    "this ratio is computed for three simple types of variations in  [ sec : results ] and the implications for 3c279 are discussed in  [ sec : 3c279 ] .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the time variability of the source spectrum is approximated as a sequence of steady state spectra .",
    "we have used the code developed in sk94 to compute the steady - state synchrotron spectrum and self - compton x - ray flux from a homogeneous sphere containing an isotropic power - law distribution of relativistic electrons @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "we assume @xmath19 in all the simulations and the normalization ( @xmath20 ) is fixed by the assumed @xmath2 .",
    "this code incorporates synchrotron absorption and emission , inverse compton scattering and induced compton scattering by the relativistic electrons .",
    "stimulated scattering becomes the dominant source of radio opacity when @xmath21 ( sk94 ) and must be included when calculating the spectra of compact radio sources .",
    "self - absorption reemerges as the dominant opacity source at low frequencies and inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons by electrons with @xmath22 contributes to the radio flux above the self - absorption turnover .",
    "the flux variability ratio @xmath23 is the ratio of the fractional change in the synchrotron flux at @xmath0 ( @xmath24 ) and the self - compton x - ray flux ( @xmath25 ) at 1 kev caused by a fluctuation in the physical parameter @xmath26 . in this paper",
    "we investigate three different variations : the thomson depth ( @xmath2 ) of the source varies at fixed magnetic field strength ( @xmath27 ) , the magnetic field strength ( @xmath3 ) varies at fixed @xmath2 ( @xmath28 ) and equal fractional changes in @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath29 .",
    "the third case approximates the passage of a strong shock through the plasma , assuming that the field is tangled ( marscher & gear 1985 ) .",
    "we also assume that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are uniform throughout the source .",
    "simple analytic calculations of @xmath30 are possible for synchrotron self - compton scattering ( sk94 ) , but @xmath30 must be calculated numerically when the induced compton scattering opacity is large ( sk94 ) .",
    "we compute the variability ratio using the approximate formula @xmath31 and the radio spectra and x - ray fluxes from two models with closely spaced values of the parameter @xmath26 . in this paper",
    "we choose @xmath32 but the results are fairly insensitive to @xmath33 , even when @xmath34 ( see figures in sincell 1996 ) .",
    "we have calculated @xmath5 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 and a range of @xmath3 . in figs . [",
    "fig : tau variability ] , [ fig : b variability ] and [ fig : shock variability ] we plot @xmath30 as a function of @xmath38 , where @xmath6 is the synchrotron self - absorption turnover frequency .",
    "when the effects of induced and inverse compton scattering on the radio spectrum are neglected , @xmath39 is independent of the unperturbed values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . including compton scattering in the computation of the radio spectrum introduces a strong dependence upon @xmath2 but @xmath39 remains nearly independent of @xmath3 because the induced compton scattering optical depth at @xmath6 is @xmath40 ( sk94 ) .",
    "the code was used to verify that @xmath30 changed by less than a few percent when @xmath3 increased by two orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , we present @xmath30 for @xmath41 and use the relation ( sk94 ) @xmath42 to scale @xmath30 to any desired field strength , doppler boost ( @xmath43 ) or redshift ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "although @xmath39 is independent of the unperturbed values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 when the effects of compton scattering on the radio spectrum are neglected , it does depend on which parameters vary . at optically thin frequencies , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , independent of frequency ( figs .",
    "[ fig : tau variability ] , [ fig : b variability ] and [ fig : shock variability ] ) .",
    "these numerical values are in good agreement with the analytic results in sk94 .",
    "synchrotron self - absorption reduces @xmath30 at @xmath49 .",
    "this is because any change in the physical parameters which increases the synchrotron emissivity results in a compensating increase in the opacity and decrease in the photospheric depth .",
    "thus , the net flux at optically thick frequencies is less sensitive to changes in the source parameters .",
    "the ratio of the self - absorption opacity to the emissivity increases rapidly as @xmath50 decreases ( sk94 ) and @xmath5 approaches zero at @xmath51 .",
    "increasing @xmath3 also increases @xmath6 ( eq . [ eq : nuo scaling ] ) and the increase in the self - absorption opacity at fixed @xmath0 overwhelms the increase in the emissivity when @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting decrease in the synchrotron flux at @xmath0 appears as negative values of @xmath35 and @xmath53 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : b variability ] and [ fig : shock variability ] ) .",
    "negative values of @xmath30 correspond to an anti - correlation of the synchrotron and self - compton fluxes .",
    "compton scattering changes the frequency dependence of @xmath30 and introduces a dependence on @xmath2 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : tau variability ] , [ fig : b variability ] and [ fig : shock variability ] ) . induced compton scattering reduces @xmath5 over more than a decade in frequency when @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tau variability ] ) , relative to the synchrotron self - compton scattering model without stimulated scattering .",
    "@xmath5 at @xmath55 is reduced by almost an order of magnitude when @xmath4 .",
    "the stimulated scattering opacity at low frequencies and the contribution of inverse compton scattered photons at higher frequencies results in a monotonic increase in @xmath5 from @xmath56 at @xmath57 to @xmath7 at @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tau variability ] ) .",
    "even though synchrotron self - absorption is the dominant source of opacity , stimulated scattering increases the photon occupation numbers at low frequencies .",
    "this increases the synchrotron flux at @xmath52 and the anti - correlation of the synchrotron and self - compton fluxes caused by variations in @xmath3 disappears when @xmath4 .    variations in the magnetic field strength introduce local extrema into @xmath59 when the stimulated scattering optical depth is large .",
    "the largest contribution to the induced compton scattering opacity at @xmath49 is from electrons with @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the peak of the spectrum ( sk94 ) .",
    "the low energy cutoff @xmath62 reduces the stimulated scattering opacity at frequencies @xmath63 because @xmath64 and there are no electrons which couple @xmath0 to @xmath65 .",
    "when synchrotron self - absorption is the dominant source of opacity , the optical depth of the plasma decreases with frequency and @xmath9 increases with frequency .",
    "a local maximum in @xmath9 appears at the frequency where the stimulated scattering opacity is approximately equal to the synchrotron opacity . at higher frequencies ,",
    "induced compton scattering limits the variations in the synchrotron flux and reduces @xmath9 . the local minimum in @xmath9 occurs at @xmath66 where the stimulated scattering opacity reaches a maximum .",
    "these local extrema are not as prominent in @xmath5 because variations in @xmath2 increase the optical depth at all frequencies . however , the kink in the @xmath67 curve of @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tau variability ] ) is also due to this effect .",
    "g95 used historical light curves of 3c279 to show that variations in the radio - mm and x - ray fluxes are strongly correlated with a time delay of @xmath68  days .",
    "they also calculated the logarhithmic dispersion , or variability amplitude ( @xmath69 ) , of the available measurements and found that @xmath69 increases systematically with frequency .",
    "however , these estimates of @xmath69 are uncertain because many emission components contribute to the observed flux at a given frequency ( unwin , 1989 )",
    ". these components may vary independently and the g95 data lacks the spatial resolution necessary to reliably subtract the non - variable background .",
    "long - term monitoring at higher resolution ( vlba ) is necessary to remove this source of uncertainty . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we will assume that the variable component dominates the observed flux , but it should be remembered that a significant amount of non - variable flux at @xmath0 will reduce @xmath69 below the value expected for the variable component alone .",
    "both the strong correlation of the radio and x - ray fluxes and the absence of a detectable time delay between variations in the two bands are consistent with the assumptions of the synchrotron self - compton model for the continuum emission .",
    "we used the variability amplitudes calculated by g95 to estimate @xmath70 at four frequencies in the range @xmath71 .",
    "the estimated @xmath9 for the epochs 1988 - 1991.4 and 1991.4 - 1993.2 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : observed variability ] .",
    "the model @xmath5 for @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 is displayed on the same figure .",
    "the relative amplitudes of the variations in the radio and x - ray fluxes from 3c279 are consistent with the synchrotron self - compton model if @xmath2 varies in a fixed magnetic field and induced compton scattering is the dominant source of radio opacity .",
    "it is immediately apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : observed variability ] that the magnitudes of both @xmath35 and @xmath53 are too large to fit the observed values of @xmath9 for 3c279 . in addition , neither the local extrema in @xmath9 or the anti - correlation of the synchrotron and self - compton fluxes are observed .",
    "we also find that the increase in @xmath9 with frequency is much slower than expected for the synchrotron self - compton model without induced compton scattering ( fig .",
    "[ fig : observed variability ] ) .",
    "however , both the magnitude and the frequency dependence of @xmath9 are consistent with @xmath5 when @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that @xmath75 in the synchrotron self - compton emission region .",
    "the magnetic field strength and doppler factor can not be calculated independently ( eq . [ eq : nuo scaling ] ) , but the values we have assumed ( @xmath76 and @xmath74 ) are consistent with other estimates of the physical parameters for 3c279 ( ghisellini , etal 1985 , maraschi , 1992 , sk94 ) .",

    "a strong shock passing through the synchrotron emission region amplifies both the electron density and the magnetic field strength if the magnetic field is either tangled or aligned parallel to the shock front ( marscher & gear 1985 ) .",
    "our results for 3c279 indicate that the variations in the flux are due to fluctuations in the electron density alone .",
    "thus , we conclude that if the variations are caused by a shock the magnetic field must be aligned perpendicular to the shock front .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the observed variations are due to fluctuations in the local electron density caused by a change in the particle injection rate .",
    "we have calculated @xmath83 , the relative amplitude of variations in the synchrotron flux at @xmath0 and the self - compton x - ray flux at 1 kev , for a homogeneous sphere of relativistic electrons orbiting in a tangled magnetic field .",

    "we find that @xmath5 increases monotonically from low to high frequencies , but a slight change in the stimulated scattering opacity at @xmath87 causes local extrema in @xmath59 .",
    "variations in the thomson depth of a homogeneous source of synchrotron self - compton radiation reproduces the relative amplitudes of the correlated radio and x - ray flux variations in 3c279 ( g95 ) if @xmath77 and the emission region is optically thick to induced compton scattering . although @xmath3 and @xmath43 can not be independently constrained ( eq .",
    "[ eq : nuo scaling ] ) , the observed @xmath9 is consistent with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "if we assume that the maximum linear dimension of the emission region is @xmath90 pc , as implied by the variability time scale , @xmath77 requires that the electron density be @xmath91  @xmath92 . in this case , the particle energy density is much larger than the magnetic field energy density .",

    "if the observed fluctuations are due to the passage of a shock , the magnetic field must be oriented perpendicular to the shock front .",
    "variations in the local particle injection rate could change the electron density without necessarily changing the field strength .",
    "finally , it has been argued that stimulated scattering can not be important in blazars with optically thick spectral indices of @xmath93 ( litchfield , 1995 ) .",
    "this argument is erroneous because synchrotron self - absorption _ always _ becomes the dominant source of opacity , and @xmath93 , at low enough frequencies ( sk94 ) .",
