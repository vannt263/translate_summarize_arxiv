    "decays of @xmath14 mesons to two - body final states including a charmonium meson have played a crucial role in the observation of @xmath15-violation in the @xmath14 meson system  @xcite .",

    "this mechanism also predicts a branching fraction for @xmath22 comparable to that for @xmath23 .",
