    "this paper on iterated function systems concerns related concepts : the fast basin , fractal continuation , an extended code space , and the branched fractal manifold .",
    "the fast basin of an attractor of an iterated function system ( ifs ) is the set of points , each of which possesses a chaos game orbit @xcite that reaches the attractor in finitely many steps .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath0 be an attractor of an ifs , @xmath1 , here defined to be a finite set of homeomorphisms @xmath2 mapping a complete metric space @xmath3 onto itself .",
    "the fast basin of @xmath0 is the set of points @xmath4 such that there exists a finite sequence of digits @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "equivalently , the fast basin is the complement of the set of points , all of whose orbits do not intersect the attractor",
    ". some examples of fast basins , corresponding to geometrically simple ifss , are presented in section 3 , illustrating that they can have interesting geometrical structure and that they are not easy to understand .",
    "fast basins of affine ifss may have non - integer hausdorff dimension and thus comprise a class of deterministic fractals which may be suitable for geometrical modelling of real - world objects .",
    "but our interest here is in their mathematical structure , which is relevant to fractal transformations @xcite , tiling theory @xcite , and non - commutative geometry @xcite .",
    "a branched fractal manifold is a certain metric space built from the code space of a point - fibred attractor of an ifs .",
    "its projection onto @xmath3 is the fast basin of the attractor .",
    "the initial motivation for defining and analyzing branched fractal manifolds was a desire to understand the topological structures of fast basins , at least in the case of simple ifss consisting of a few affine maps .",
    "another motivation for interest in fast basins and branched fractal manifolds is a new view of analytic continuation , introduced in @xcite . according to this view",
    ", fractal continuation provides an extension of the notion of analytic continuation . as a simple example , consider the ifs defined by the pair of mbius transformations , @xmath7 acting on the riemann sphere .",
    "this ifs has a unique attractor , an arc of a circle ( of radius one half , centered at @xmath8 ) .",
    "the fast basin is the whole circle , i.e. the analytic continuation of the arc .",
    "this illustrates a more general situation . in @xcite",
    "it is proved , under conditions that are not stated here , that the graph of a real analytic function over an interval , say @xmath9 $ ] , is the attractor of an ifs whose maps are analytic on a neighborhood of the graph , and generalized blowups of the graph , generated using the ifs , coincide with the graph of any analytic continuation of the original function , where both are defined . in @xcite and here , we refer to generalized fractal blowups of the graphs of fractal interpolation functions as ( fractal ) continuations . in @xcite",
    "it is further established that all except two fractal continuations of the graphs of any affine fractal interpolation function @xmath10\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}$ ] are defined for all real @xmath11 .",
    "although a fractal continuation coincides with the real analytic continuation of @xmath12 when @xmath12 is real analytic on a neighborhood of @xmath9 $ ] , in general the graphs of different continuations of an affine fractal interpolation function do not coincide , except over @xmath9 $ ] . instead",
    ", their union , which is an example of a fast basin , may be interpreted as an analog or generalization of analytic continuation applied to a fractal function @xmath12 . in this interpretation ,",
    "different continuations of @xmath12 belong to different branches , thus the need to understand how these branches fit together and the motivation for the fast basin and branched fractal manifold .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : ifs ]",
    "we define point - fibred ifss , their attractors , duals , basins , fast basins and fractal continuations .",
    "a fractal continuation is a generalization of a fractal blowup as defined by strichartz @xcite .",
    "proposition  [ prop : fb ] states that the fast basin of an attractor is the union of its fractal continuations .",
    "section  [ examplesec ] provides examples of fast basins .",
    "the relationship between the basin and the fast basin of an attractor is the subject of section  [ sec : bfb ] .",
    "theorem  [ reversethm ] shows that the image of a disjunctive point in code space under the coding map ( see below ) belongs to the boundary of an attractor if and only if the interior of the attractor is empty .",
    "theorem  [ interiorthm ] relates addresses of points in attractors to whether or not associated continuations contain the basin , using the concept of full or reversible addresses , defined here and in @xcite . as a consequence , corollary  [ cor : basins ]",
    "states that the fast basin contains the basin if and only if the attractor has nonempty interior . in section 5 , two",
    "symbolic ifss @xmath13 and @xmath14 are introduced .",
    "the first , @xmath15 involves shift maps on @xmath16 and is well known , when @xmath1 is contractive , to be related to the attractor @xmath0 by the following commutative diagram . @xmath17{ccccc } &   & \\sigma_{n } &   & \\\\ & \\mathbb{i}_{+ } & \\rightarrow & \\mathbb{i}_{+ } & \\\\ \\pi & \\downarrow &   & \\downarrow & \\pi\\\\ & a & \\rightarrow & a & \\\\ &   & f_{n } &   & \\end{array}\\ ]",

    "( theorem  [ hktheorem ] extends ( 1.1 ) to the case @xmath1 is point - fibred . )",
    "however , @xmath13 is not an ifs , as defined in this paper , as the maps of @xmath13 are not invertible and its fast basin is undefined .",
    "this is remedied by the introduction of @xmath19 whose maps are invertible . here",
    "@xmath20 is a certain shift invariant subspace of @xmath21 .",
    "the attractor of @xmath14 is @xmath22 and its fast basin , @xmath23 , provides a symbolic representation for any attractor of @xmath1 and its fast basin .",
    "it is shown that the coding map @xmath18 can be extended to various subspaces of @xmath20 , including @xmath24 , and that the action of shift maps on these subspaces is ( semi- ) conjugate to the action of the @xmath25s ( and/or their inverses ) on corresponding subspaces of @xmath3 , including the fast basin of @xmath0 .",
    "dual relationships also hold in certain cases .",
    "these results are summarized by the commutative diagrams in theorem  [ extenthm ] and corollaries  [ theorem1 ] and [ dualcasethm ] .",
    "the branched fractal manifold @xmath26 associated with a point - fibred attractor of an invertible ifs is defined in section  [ leafsec ] .",
    "it is a metric space constructed from the symbolic fast basin @xmath27 by identifying some addresses .",
    "it is a disjoint union of certain leaves , each leaf being homeomorphic to one of at most @xmath28 subsets of @xmath0 , but @xmath26 itself may not be locally compact . also , @xmath26 contains isometric copies , called sheets , of all the fractal continuations of the original attractor .",

    "examples are provided .",
    "notions related to but distinct from fast basins and branched fractal manifolds occur in the literature , mainly in the context of ifss of similitudes with the open set condition ( osc ) . in particular",
    ", some fast basins are fractafolds as defined by stritchartz ( * ? ? ? * section 5.4 ) , and some are examples of fractafold bundles as defined by ionescu and kumjian @xcite .",
    "we discuss these related notions in more detail in the following paragraphs . in @xcite strichartz",
    "defines and establishes some properties of fractal blowups ( called fractal continuations here ) for a similitude ifs that obeys the osc .",
    "fractal blowups ( continuations ) for the classical cantor set , the sierpinski triangle , and the koch curve are investigated , and it is noted that various different ifss , with the koch curve as the attractor , yield different blowups .",
    "it is pointed out that in general a given ifs may yield a nondenumerable set of non - homeomorphic blowups , where the relative topology is assumed .",
    "strichartz is focused on post critically finite ( pcf ) fractals because energy forms and laplacians can be defined on their blowups . in (",
    "* section 5.4 ) strichartz defines a fractafold to be a countable union of pcf fractals , glued together on their boundaries in such a way that every point in the fractafold has a neighborhood that is conjugate to a neighborhood of a point on the attractor ; this notion subsumes fractal blowups . in his context",
    ", strichartz considers a fractafold to be a generalization of the notion of a manifold , with the role of euclidean space ( or half - space ) being played by the attractor . in various works ,",
    "see for example @xcite , he has shown how energy forms and laplacians on p.c.f .",
    "fractals can be extended to fractafolds .",
    "some branched fractal manifolds are related to fractafold bundles , defined by ionescu and kumjian @xcite .",

    "they define the associated fractafold bundle @xmath33 to be @xmath34 but with a certain inductive limit topology in place of the relative topology .",
