    "the data used in this work comes from the ongoing manga survey@xcite using the sdss 2.5-m telescope@xcite .",
    "one of three programs comprising sdss - iv , manga is obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopy for 10,000 nearby galaxies with @xmath77 and a median redshift of @xmath78 . the @xmath79-band signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the galaxy outskirts is 4 - 8 @xmath80 , and the wavelength coverage is 3600 - 10,300 @xmath81 .",
    "the effective spatial resolution is 2.4@xmath35 ( full width at half max ; fwhm ) with an instrumental spectral resolution of @xmath82 km s@xmath38 .",
    "the sample and data products used here were drawn from the internal manga product launch-3 ( mpl-3 ) , which includes @xmath83 galaxies observed before april 2015 and will be publicly available in the thirteenth sdss data release .",
    "ancillary data are from the nasa - sloan atlas ( nsa@xcite ) , mpa - jhu dr7 data release@xcite , and other recent works@xcite .",
    "we assume a flat cosmological model with @xmath84 km s@xmath38 mpc@xmath38 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , and all magnitudes are given in the ab magnitude system@xcite .",
    "the data analysis pipeline ( dap ) , which uses ppxf@xcite and the miuscat stellar library@xcite , fits the stellar continuum in each spaxel and produces estimates of the stellar kinematics . flux and ew measurements were measured through simple flux - summing@xcite after we subtract the stellar continuum .",
    "we only show flux and ew measurements with s / n@xmath87 in the wavelength range around a given line .",
    "ionized gas kinematics , i.e. , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , were estimated by fitting a single gaussian to the h@xmath6 emission line .          using a spectral fitting code@xcite , we present the dust extinction map of akira in extended data figure 1 .",
    "the superimposed na d contours ( from fig .",
    "1d ) overlap with enhanced extinction ( darker spaxels ) , supporting the association of the offset na d absorption with cool foreground material .",
    "to measure the line - of - sight ( los ) velocity of this na d - absorbing material , which we defined as spaxels with na d ew > 3.5 @xmath81 , we first subtract the stellar continuum fit determined for akira by the dap .",
    "extended data figure 2a - c shows the stellar continuum fits ( red ) around the na d doublet ( the two black vertical lines mark the expected locations of the na d doublet ) for three spectra .",
    "extended data figure 2a shows data from a recent work@xcite , extended data figure 2b shows the central spaxel of akira , marked by the `` x '' in the fig .",
    "1d - e and extended data figure  1 , and extended data figure 2c shows a spaxel to the northwest of akira , marked by the single box in the upper right of fig .",
    "1d - e and extended data figure  1 .",
    "we then examine the residual absorption as a function of wavelength , as shown in extended data figure 2d - f . focusing on extended data figure 2d - f",
    ", we determine the line centroids in akira by first defining a reference na d profile for typical , cold interstellar medium gas at rest .",
    "we use the stacked , continuum - subtracted spectrum of na d from a large set of highly inclined disk galaxies for this reference@xcite , which is shown in the left panel .",
    "we define an at - rest line centroid for cool na d gas by averaging the wavelengths in this profile , each weighted by the amplitude of the residual absorption at that wavelength ( weighting is performed within the green region ) .",
    "the resulting centroid is marked by the dotted grey vertical line , which is repeated in the two right panels for reference . in the same way",
    ", we determine line centroids for the observed residual profiles across the na d - absorbing material in akira , which is marked by the blue vertical lines in the two right panels .",
    "we then calculate the velocity difference between the reference na d centroid and the observed na d centroid in these spaxels of akira ; this velocity difference is shown in the upper left in extended data figure 2e - f .",
    "we modeled the interaction between akira and tetsuo using the gadget-2@xcite code and the methodology described in a recent work@xcite .",
    "these simulations are constrained by the available data and contain more than 4 million particles that account for stars , dark matter , and gas ( we only consider gas in tetsuo ) .",
    "these simulations also include cooling , star formation , and supernova feedback , but not agn feedback nor the proposed wind .",
    "the initial total mass merger ratio is @xmath81:10 , but because tetsuo loses mass during the interaction , this ratio falls to @xmath81:20 at the time most closely matching the observations ( the observed stellar mass merger ratio is 1:40 ) . according to the best - matching viewing angle for this prograde encounter ,",
    "tetsuo starts in the foreground to the lower - right of akira and begins arcing over the top and away from the observer ( see extended data figure 3a - d ) .",
    "after a glancing blow with akira , a tidal bridge is generated that loops back and passes through akira to form the shell structure seen to the lower - right ( extended data figure 3d ) .",
    "this snapshot at t=0.56 gyr best matches the sdss @xmath79 image ( extended data figure 3f ) , and it indicates that tetsuo is behind akira .",
    "extended data figure 3e shows a composite stars+gas representation at this snapshot ; it indicates that a stream of cool gas from tetsuo has followed the stellar bridge that is behind akira , penetrated close to akira s center , emerged in front of akira on its lower - right side , and approaches the observer .",
    "the shape of the tidal bridge and shell to the south - west in the sdss image ( extended data figure 3f ) provides the most significant constraints on the simulation and its viewing angle .",
    "an important cross - check is that the orientation of tetsuo s stellar and ionized gas velocity fields ( also observed by manga ) are reproduced as well .",
    "the geometry and velocity scale of the cool gas is similar to the observed na d component ( fig .",
    "1d - e ) , but there are differences with the observations .",
    "portions of the observed na d gas appear to be falling back into akira ( redshift ; fig .",
    "1e ) , but these are not seen in the simulation until a later time step .",
    "the observed cool gas orientation is also more horizontal while the simulation predicts the gas stream stretches further ( extended data figure 3e ) .",
    "but we emphasize that we only detect cool gas in absorption where there are background stars from host galaxy , whereas the simulation allows us to see the full extent of the cool gas .",
    "differences between the simulations and observations may also arise from inaccuracies in the initialization of the merger simulation ( mass ratios , gas mass fractions , angular momentum alignment , etc . ) , limitations in the hydrodynamic gas treatment , or missing components in the simulation such as akira s gas supply and the proposed agn - driven wind .",
    "jeans anisotropic modeling ( jam@xcite ) , which uses the multi - gaussian expansion ( mge@xcite ) parametrization for mass and light distributions , was performed on akira and other red geysers to model their stellar kinematics and gravitational potential .",
    "the jam model derives a 3d stellar density by de - projecting the observed sdss @xmath79-band photometry using an mge fit .",
    "the modeled potential includes an nfw@xcite dark matter halo .",
    "the jam model has four free parameters : the inclination @xmath92 , anisotropy @xmath93 , stellar @xmath94 , and halo mass .",
    "these are optimized by fitting the model prediction for the second velocity moments , @xmath95 , to the observed manga stellar kinematics . through a number of systematics tests",
    ", we find that the best - fit stellar inclination is @xmath96 , with an upper limit of @xmath97 .",
    "although there is some covariance between the model parameters , the resulting _ total _ mass profile , is extremely robust@xcite .    with the total gravitational potential defined from the stellar jam modeling above",
    ", we can predict projected second velocity moment ( @xmath98 ) maps of gas under the assumption of axisymmetric orbital distributions . we treat the @xmath49-emitting gas clouds as a `` tracer '' population of the underlying potential .",
    "its flux distribution is modeled by a separate mge ( distinct from the stellar component ) enabling de - projection of the observed @xmath49 surface brightness .",
    "the jeans equations are then solved for this tracer , within the fixed potential , to predict the @xmath98 allowed by the given mass distribution .",
    "we emphasize that the second moments are independent of the degree of circular motion versus `` random '' motion in the hypothesized disk .",
    "the analysis does not account for non - gravitational drivers of turbulent pressure , such as from the agn - driven wind we propose . in extended data figure 4",
    "( see also fig .",
    "1j ) we show results for gaseous inclinations of @xmath99 ( the minimum allowed by the @xmath100 from galfit fits of the @xmath49 flux , corresponding to an intrinsic axis ratio @xmath101 ; see below ) and the most extreme case of @xmath102 ( an edge - on axisymmetric density ) . in either case , the allowed @xmath98 is far below the observed @xmath98 .    with discrepancies as high as @xmath47 km s@xmath38 , torques of the same order as the gravitational potential itself would be required to explain the data , making a `` disturbed '' disk a highly unlikely explanation .",
    "it is possible to imagine a very chaotic accretion scenario where the jam assumptions of axisymmetry and stability completely break down , although in this case an ordered velocity gradient of the kind observed seems unlikely . such a scenario would also struggle to explain how the high dispersions are generated and why enhanced @xmath49 flux is observed along the gradient in the gradient field .",
    "similarly , because line widths of @xmath41500 km s@xmath38 could not be sustained by accreting tidal streams or caused by tidal torques , multiple overlapping gas streams would have to conspire to produce the widespread high velocity dispersion observed ( fig .",
    "1i ) while maintaining an ordered velocity gradient pattern .",
    "a similar set of coincidences would be required for each galaxy in the rest of the red geyser sample .",
    "not surprisingly , tilted - disk models@xcite that fit the ionized velocity field alone do a poor job for the red geyser sample . characterizing the goodness - of - fit by an error - weighted average residual",
    ", the majority of red geysers exhibit residuals that place them among the worst 5% of fitted manga galaxies with `` disk - like '' kinematics .",
    "here , disk - like refers to galaxies with reasonable agreement between stellar and gaseous systemic velocities , dynamical centers , position angles , and inclinations .",
    "finally , we use the dynamically - constrained potential to estimate a local escape velocity and compare this to the inferred velocity distribution of a putative disk .",
    "several assumptions are required , but the results are informative .",
    "we obtain a rough estimate of escape velocity , @xmath103 km s@xmath38 , by integrating the potential from a projected radius of @xmath104 ( 3.4 kpc or just under 1 @xmath105 ) to 4 @xmath105 ( 16 kpc ) and assuming a gentle decline in the circular velocity at large radius .",
    "we then use galfit@xcite to model the observed @xmath49 flux surface brightness , finding a consistent projected axis ratio of @xmath106 , regardless of the assumed model profile ( exponential , de vaucouleurs , or free srsic ) and despite significant structure in the residuals ( of order @xmath107 ) . hypothesizing a disk with an intrinsic axis ratio , @xmath108 , roughly twice as `` fat '' as typical disks@xcite",
    ", we estimate an inclination of @xmath48 .",
    "this is also the upper limit of inclinations allowed for the stellar kinematics , and precession should align accreted material with the stellar distribution in roughly a few dynamical times@xcite ( unless there is a source of incoming misaligned gas@xcite ) .",
    "we de - project the observed mean velocities using this inclination and consider the distribution of velocities about this mean .",
    "roughly 15 - 20% of the gas , i.e. , with velocities greater than 1@xmath109 from the mean , would exceed the escape velocity under these assumptions .",
    "we construct a simple wind model that reproduces many qualitative features of the manga observations . in this model",
    ", the wind assumes a wide - angle biconical form centered on the galaxy nucleus . within the bicone ,",
    "the wind has a constant amplitude , radially - outward velocity@xcite .",
    "we assume that warm gas clouds entrained by the wind trace this velocity structure and emit flux in strong emission lines primarily in response to the local ionization field supplied by the stars@xcite . the projected wind velocity field to first order is therefore a convolution of the wind geometry with the galaxy s 3d luminosity profile .    to realize the model , we populate a randomized 3d cartesian grid of points with the galaxy at the center and assign each point a weight equal the value of an axisymmetric hernquist density profile sampled at that point@xcite .",
    "this density profile is fixed to reproduce the imaging and jam constrains on the stellar component , namely an intrinsic ( 3d ) axis ratio of 0.4 , an inclination of 41@xmath110 , a projected major - axis effective radius of @xmath111 , and an on - sky pa of 53@xmath110 . for a given wind opening angle and inclination , we weight the projected line - of - sight component of the wind velocity at each point inside the bicone by its hernquist profile value .",
    "projected quantities are smoothed to the spatial resolution of the manga data ( 2.4@xmath35 , fwhm ) . to model a potential enhancement of gas densities or shocks along the central axis of the bicone",
    ", we implement a second set of weights defined with respect to the bicone that decrease exponentially ( with a variable characteristic angle ) as a function of the angular distance from the bicone s axis .    by experimenting with different choices for the wind s opening angle , inclination , length , intrinsic velocity , ( and central weighting , if desired ) , we explored possible wind model solutions .",
    "most have opening angles of @xmath112 and steep inclinations ( @xmath870@xmath110 ) toward the line - of - sight .",
    "one example is shown in fig .",
    "this wind model has an opening angle of @xmath50 , an inclination of 75@xmath110 , pa = 55@xmath110 , and a length of @xmath113 .",
    "we have assumed a constant radially outward velocity within the wind of @xmath114 km s@xmath38 .",
    "we associate the observed , bisymmetric regions of enhanced h@xmath6 ( white contours on the observed velocity field ; fig .",
    "2b ) with the wind s central axis .",
    "the projection of this @xmath11510@xmath110 region is overplotted with white contours on the modeled velocity field ( fig .",
    "the wind density is assumed to decline as an exponential function of the angular distance with a characteristic angle of @xmath116 .",
    "the presence of a central radio source and the absence of star formation in akira imply the presence of an agn .",
    "quantitatively , we can confirm the presence of an agn by comparing the expected @xmath69 inferred from the radio luminosity of akira to the estimated @xmath69 from sed fitting of sdss and wise photometry@xcite .",
    "we first calculate the radio luminosity density of akira using @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the integrated flux density ( of 1.2 mjy ) from first@xcite , and @xmath120 is the luminosity distance .",
    "this calculation yields @xmath121 . using the radio star formation rate calibration@xcite",
    ", we infer @xmath122 .",

    "<S> 1e ) before plunging back towards akira s center ( redshifted ; fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1e ) .    </S>",
    "<S> previous work has noted similar objects@xcite but has typically attributed their gaseous dynamics and unusual emission line features to accreted , rotating disks@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , using a tight constraint on the total gravitational potential derived from the stellar kinematics , we find that the observed second velocity moments ( @xmath46 ) of the ionized gas in akira are far too high to be consistent with motions under the influence of gravity alone ( fig . 1j ; see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of gas inclination or the degree of pressure support , we can rule out any kind of axisymmetric orbital distribution . </S>",
    "<S> perturbations or torques from disk `` settling '' are also very unlikely to drive discrepancies that reach as high as @xmath47 km s@xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we can express the dynamical inconsistency of the disk hypothesis another way . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume such a disk were inclined at @xmath48 ( see methods ) , we estimate that 15 - 20% of the disk would be moving at velocities sufficient to escape the galaxy . with similar velocity properties observed for the rest of theses galaxies </S>",
    "<S> , the disk interpretation also fails to explain why the bisymmetric @xmath49 features are always in rough alignment with the major kinematic axis . </S>",
    "<S> if arising from internal structure in a moderately face - on disk , this structure should be randomly oriented compared to the kinematic axis , which is instead determined by the observer s viewing angle .    </S>",
    "<S> a relatively simple wind model with a constant radially - outward velocity of 310 km s@xmath38 confined to a wide - angle cone ( @xmath50 ) reproduces several qualitative features in the data ( fig .  2 ; see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model captures the overall shape of the ionized gas velocity field and associates the extended ( horizontal ) zones of high ionized gas velocity dispersion along the kinematic minor axis with the overlapping projection of approaching and receding surfaces of the inclined wind cone . by assigning somewhat greater wind densities to the cone center </S>",
    "<S> , we can explain the offsets between the projected kinematic major axis of the ionized gas and both the stellar position angle and the h@xmath6 flux orientation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the bisymmetric h@xmath6 ew features can be explained by enhanced gas over - densities or shock ionization along the central wind axis . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3d - e demonstrates that line ratios in the @xmath49 ew feature ( black points and boxes throughout fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) tend to cluster and are consistent with those predicted by `` fast '' shock models@xcite with velocities of 200400 km s@xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> the wind s driving mechanism likely originates in akira s radio active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , which is detected in first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ) data with a luminosity density of @xmath51 , and is most consistent with being a point source according to higher - resolution ( @xmath52 ) follow - up jansky vla ( very large array ) radio observations ( w.r . </S>",
    "<S> , in prep ) . </S>",
    "<S> since this agn lacks obvious extended radio jets , its feedback is most likely manifest in small - scale jets ( @xmath53 kpc ) or uncollimated winds@xcite . despite an eddington ratio of @xmath54 , energetics arguments show that the agn s mechanical output ( @xmath55 ) is sufficient to supply the wind s kinetic power ( @xmath56 erg s@xmath38 ; see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the wind can inject sufficient energy , coupled to the ambient gas through the turbulent dynamics observed ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1i and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a - c ) , to balance cooling in both the ionized and cool gas ( @xmath57 erg s@xmath38 ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the amount of cool na d gas ( @xmath58 ) implies a star formation rate of @xmath59 , which is much higher than the estimated@xcite @xmath60 that leverages well - detected wise photometry . </S>",
    "<S> the picture that emerges is one in which cool gas inflow in akira , triggered by the minor merger , has initiated a relatively low - power agn - driven wind that is nonetheless able to heat the surrounding gas through turbulence and shocks and thereby prevent any substantial star formation .    </S>",
    "<S> as with akira , the other galaxies in this class show little or no ongoing star formation , and the majority harbor similarly weak radio point sources ( according to followup jansky vla observations ) that would be classified as `` jet mode , '' `` kinetic mode , '' or `` radio mode '' agn@xcite . with similar levels of fast - moving ionized gas oriented along enhanced ionized emission , we conclude that agn - driven winds are present in these systems as well and represent an important heating source . </S>",
    "<S> because the full spatial extent of these winds may exceed the field - of - view of our observations , a lower limit of @xmath810@xmath61 yr for the timescale of this phenomenon is given by the radial extent divided by the typical wind velocity . </S>",
    "<S> assuming all quiescent galaxies experience these agn - driven winds , the @xmath85% occurrence rate ( averaged over the full mass range ) implies an episodic behavior that leads us to name these objects `` red geysers . '' </S>",
    "<S> present primarily below @xmath62 , these galaxies lie in isolated halos with moderate masses@xcite ( @xmath63 ) and exhibit no signs of major interactions . their implied trigger rate ( at most , a few episodes per gyr ) may be related to minor mergers ( approximately one per gyr@xcite ) as well as central accretion of ambient hot gas from stellar mass loss@xcite . </S>",
