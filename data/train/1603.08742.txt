    "nonequilibrium phase transitions are considered a key feature of a countless number of phenomena , such as magnetic systems , biological and ecological models , water - like anomalies , and many others @xcite .",
    "recently , a considerable interest has been devoted to the inclusion of more realistic ingredients in order to describe ( or mimick ) the effects of impurities or external fluctuations , as well as their effects in the phase transition @xcite .",
    "commonly , these ingredients are introduced by allowing the control parameter to assume distinct values in space and/or time .",
    "the former case , regarded as quenched disorder , affects drastically the phase transitions , leading to the existence of a new universality classes and local regions in the absorbing phases , characterized by large activities with slow decays towards extinction .",
    "these rare regions typically arise when the activation rate @xmath6 lies between the clean value @xmath7 ( without disorder ) and the dirty ( disordered ) critical point @xmath8 ; ie , @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , in these regions the system may exhibit non - universal exponents toward full extinction @xcite .",
    "heuristically , the harris criterion @xcite establishes that quenched disorder is a relevant perturbation if @xmath10 , where @xmath11 the system dimensionality and @xmath12 is the spatial correlation length exponent . for models belonging to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class @xmath13 and @xmath14 in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "consequently , the harris criterion indicates that spatial disorder is a relevant perturbation for continuous absorbing phase transitions in all dimensions .",
    "conversely , the imry - ma @xcite and aizenman - wehl @xcite criteria establish that quenched disorder suppresses the phase coexistence in equilibrium systems for @xmath17 . afterwards",
    ", it was shown @xcite that the discontinuous transition in the ziff - gulari - barshad ( zgb ) model becomes continuous when the disorder strength is large enough .",
    "more recently , villa - martn et al .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the imry - ma - aizenman - wehl conjecture should be extended for discontinuous absorbing phase transitions for @xmath17 , irrespective of the disorder magnitude .",
    "although less studied than spatial disorder , the influence the temporal disorder has also been considered in some cases @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the quenched disorder , here the control parameter becomes time - dependent , resulting in a temporarily active ( ordered ) as well as absorbing ( disordered ) phases , whose effect of variability becomes pronounced at the emergence of the phase transition .",
    "in particular , the available results have shown that temporal disorder is a highly relevant perturbation @xcite , suppressing the dp phase transitions in all dimension . for systems with up - down symmetry",
    "they are relevant only for @xmath18 .",
    "_ temporal griffiths phases _",
    "( tgps ) , a region in the active phase characterized by power - law spatial scaling and generic divergences of the susceptibility , have also been reported for absorbing phase transitions @xcite , but not found in low dimensional systems with up - down symmetry @xcite . on the other hand , the effect of temporal disorder for _ discontinuous _ absorbing phase transitions is still unknown .    in order to shed some light in this direction , here we investigate the effects of temporal disorder in discontinuous absorbing phase transition .",
    "our study aims to answer three fundamental questions : ( i ) is the occurrence of phase coexistence forbidden under the presence of temporal disorder ?",
    "( ii ) if no , which changes does it provoke with respect to the pure ( without disorder ) version ? ( iii ) does the temporal disorder induce temporal griffiths phases around these phase transitions ? these ideas will be tested in three models which are known to yield discontinuous absorbing phase transitions in two- and infinite - dimensional systems , namely the zgb model for co oxidation @xcite and two lattice versions of the second schlgl model ( ssm ) @xcite .",
    "as we will show , in all cases the phase transition is characterized by a behavior similar to their pure ( without disorder ) counterparts , including bistability around the coexistence point and common finite size scaling behavior with the inverse of the system volume , as recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we review the models studied and the simulation methods employed . results and discussion are shown in sec .",
    "iii and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the ssm is single - species autocatalytic reaction model defined by the reactions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which occurs with transition rates @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "such system displays a discontinuous phase transition that can be qualitatively reproduced under a mean - field treatment .",
    "the first reaction predicts a particle growth following a quadratic dependence on the density , which makes low - density ( active ) state unstable and thus , a jump to a nonzero ( large ) density arises as the creation probability @xmath23 increases to a threshold value @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , distinct works have claimed that these reaction rules are not sufficient to exhibit a discontinuity in a regular lattice @xcite .",
    "in particular , the system dimensionality and the geometrical constraint of requiring the presence of a pair of adjacent particles surrounding an empty site ( in order to fill the reaction @xmath19 ) are essential ingredients for the emergence of a phase coexistence @xcite .    here , we consider two square lattice versions of the ssm . the first one ( ssm1 ) , proposed by windus and jensen @xcite and afterwards reconsidered in ref .",
    "@xcite , is defined as follows : a given particle @xmath25 is chosen ( with equal probability ) from a list of currently occupied sites and is annihilated with probability @xmath26 . or , with probability @xmath27 , a nearest neighbor site of @xmath25 , called site @xmath28 , is also chosen at random . if the site @xmath28 is empty , the particle @xmath25 will diffuse for it . if @xmath28 is filled by a particle , an offspring",
    "will be created at one of the neighboring sites of @xmath25 and @xmath28 ( chosen with equal possibility ) with probability @xmath29 provided it is empty ; otherwise nothing happens . the value @xmath30 has been considered to directly compare our results with previous studies @xcite .",
    "after above dynamics , the time is incremented by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the number of occupied sites .    for the second version , ssm2 ,",
    "the selection of particle @xmath25 , its annihilation probability and the choice of the nearest neighbor site @xmath28 are identical to ss1 . however , in the ssm2 when a neighboring site @xmath28 is chosen , its number of nearest neighbor occupied sites @xmath33 will be evaluated",
    ". a new offspring will be created at @xmath28 with rate @xmath34 provided @xmath35 and it is empty . more specifically , if @xmath36 no particle will be created in the vacant site . on the contrary , if @xmath37 , @xmath16 or @xmath38 , the creation will occur with probability @xmath34 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the ssm1 , the discontinuous transition is caused by both the diffusion and the creation of offsprings in the presence of two particles .",
    "conversely , in the ssm2 model it is caused by the creation of offsprings in the presence of at least two species .",
    "the third system we investigate is the zgb model @xcite , which qualitatively reproduces some features of the oxidation of carbon monoxide on a catalytic surface .",
    "the surface is modeled as a square lattice , in which each site can be empty ( @xmath39 ) , or occupied by an oxygen ( o@xmath40 ) or a carbon monoxide ( co@xmath40 ) .",
    "it is summarized by the following reactions : @xmath41 in practice , molecules of co@xmath42 and o@xmath43 hit the surface with complementary probabilities @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively ,",
    "at any time the chosen site is empty . at the surface ,",
    "o@xmath46 molecule dissociates into two independent o atoms , each one occupying two adjacent empty sites .",
    "if a co@xmath40o@xmath40 pair is placed at neighboring sites on the surface , a co@xmath47 molecule will be formed , desorbing instantaneously and leaving both sites empty . as in the ssm models , after the above dynamics is implemented , time is incremented by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total number of empty sites .    by changing the parameter @xmath44 , the model exhibits two phase transitions between an active steady state and one of two absorbing ( `` poisoned '' ) states , in which the surface is saturated either by o or by co. the o - poisoned transition is found to be continuous . on the other hand , the co - poisoned transition is discontinuous , and in this work we will focus on this specific case .    for the ssms ,",
    "the order parameter @xmath48 is the system density @xmath49 and the transitions take place at @xmath50 ( ssm1 ) @xcite and @xmath51 ( ssm2 ) @xcite . for the zgb , @xmath48 is the density of co and the transition occurs at @xmath52@xcite .",
    "the temporal disorder is introduced so that at each time interval @xmath53 , a generic control parameter @xmath3 assumes a value extracted from a uniform distribution with mean @xmath1 and width @xmath2 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath3 is evaluated using the formula @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a random number drawn at each time interval @xmath56 from the standard uniform distribution in    @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "for the ssms , @xmath1 corresponds to the creation probability @xmath58 , with a similar formula holding for the zgb model with @xmath59 replaced by @xmath44 . in order to locate the transition point and the nature of the phase transition",
    ", we consider three alternative procedures .",
    "first , we follow the time behavior of the order - parameter @xmath60 , starting from a fully active initial configuration . in the active phase , it converges to a constant value , signaling the permanent creation and annihilation of particles . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath60 decays exponentially toward extinction ( full poisoned state for the zgb ) in the absorbing phase . in the case of a typical ( without disorder )",
    "continuous phase transitions , the above regimes are separated by a power - law decay @xmath61 , with @xmath62 being the associated critical exponent . for the dp universality class , @xmath63 in two dimensions @xcite . in the presence of temporal disorder , the above critical behavior",
    "is replaced by @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "additionally , one does not expect similar behaviors at the emergence of a discontinuous transition .",
    "the coexistence point can be estimated through a threshold value @xmath65 , which separates the saturation toward a definite value from an exponential decay @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a more reliable procedure is achieved by performing a finite - size analysis , as recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to it ,",
    "the difference between the pseudo - transition point @xmath66 and the transition point @xmath67 scales with @xmath68 , where @xmath69 denotes the system volume ( in two dimensions ) the estimation of @xmath66 can be done in a variety of ways .",
    "for instance , as corresponding to the the peak of the system s order - parameter variance @xmath70 , or even through the value in which the bimodal order parameter distribution presents two equal areas @xcite .",
    "however , such scaling behavior is verified only by considering some kind of quasi - stationary ( qs ) ensemble , i.e. an ensemble of states accessed by the original dynamics at long times _ conditioned on survival _ ( and restricted to those which are not trapped into an absorbing state ) . here",
    "we employ an efficient numerical scheme given in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which configurations are stored and gradually updated during the evolution of the stochastic process .",
    "whenever the transition to the absorbing state is imminent , the system is `` relocated '' to a saved configuration .",
    "this accurately reproduces the results from the much longer procedure of performing averages only on samples that have not been trapped in the absorbing state at the end of their respective runs .",
    "the intensive quantities in a qs ensemble must converge to the stationary ones when @xmath71 .    finally , in the third procedure , the mean survival time @xmath72 is considered for different system sizes . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the coexistence point is the separatrix of an exponential growth of @xmath72 and an exponential increase until @xmath73 followed by a decreasing behavior for @xmath74 . here",
    ", we shall also quantify it , in order to compare with the pure ( not disordered ) cases .",
