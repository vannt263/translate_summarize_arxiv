    "in recent times major efforts have been devoted to the study and understanding of the dynamics of open systems @xcite , both in order to give a realistic , quantitative description of the time evolution of a quantum system coupled to a generally larger system considered as environment , as well as with the aim to engineer suitable environments driving the dynamics of the quantum system according to the will of the experimenter .",
    "when considering an open system one can either use a phenomenological description for the system - environment interaction , as well as for the environment itself , or rely on a strictly microscopic description of the physical system considered . while the first approach can be more viable and flexible , the second is clearly of more fundamental nature . in the present paper",
    "we will focus on the second approach , performing a numerical study of a recently observed @xcite quantum master equation for the description of the motion of a quantum test particle in a gas .",
    "such a master equation is the quantum version of the classical linear boltzmann equation and gives a microscopic description of the dynamics of the test particle , only relying on the gas properties and on the detailed expression of the interaction between test particle and gas particles .",
    "the quantum linear boltzmann equation is characterized by its covariance under translations @xcite , and has been used in a simplified form for the quantitative description of experiments on collisional decoherence @xcite .",
    "quantitative experiments , testing the transition from the quantum to the classical world , are in fact typical situations in which a truly microscopic description of the physical system of interest is mandatory .    the translation - covariant quantum linear boltzmann equation that will be studied here may be written in the form of a quantum master equation for the time - dependent density matrix @xmath0 of the test particle , @xmath1 the infinitesimal generator @xmath2 represents a superoperator in lindblad form @xcite .",
    "it is well known that such a quantum master equation with lindblad structure allows an unravelling through a stochastic process for the state vector in the particle s hilbert space . here",
    ", we will concentrate on the so - called quantum jump method in which the state vector follows a piecewise deterministic process , consisting of smooth , deterministic evolution periods and discontinuous , random quantum jumps @xcite .",
    "it will be demonstrated that the application of this method to the quantum boltzmann equation ( [ boltzmann ] ) is indeed feasible and leads to a simple and numerically efficient three - dimensional monte carlo simulation technique for the dynamical behavior of the particle .",
    "by means of this technique we will study in particular relaxation properties of this master equation for various microscopic scattering cross sections , as well as deviations from gaussian statistics .",
    "given the quantum nature of the equation we will also investigate the time evolution of quantum superposition states .",

    "the lindblad structure of such a quantum linear boltzmann equation apart from preservation of trace and positivity is of great importance in that it implies the possibility to consider suitable stochastic unravellings leading to efficient monte carlo simulations of the time evolution of different quantities of physical interest , despite the high complexity of the problem .",

    "considering a wide separation in momentum of the initial superposition on the scale set by the momentum of the gas particles , so that @xmath191 , one can consider the corresponding limiting value @xmath192 of eq .  , and",
    "the ratio of the decoherence rate to the relaxation rate is given by @xmath193 this shows that the decoherence time @xmath194 for the loss of coherence in momentum space can be much smaller than the relaxation time @xmath195 , i.  e. than the time it takes for the relaxation of the energy of the test particle .",
    "it is also of interest to compare the relaxation timescale with the decoherence rate @xmath196 of a superposition of position eigenstates , widely separated on the scale set by the thermal wavelength of the gas particles , which corresponds to @xmath197 divided by the typical momentum transfer , so that @xmath198 .",
    "in such a case for @xmath190 the decoherence rate is set by the total transition rate @xcite , so that for a test particle much slower than the gas particles one has @xmath199 .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath200 shows again that the decoherence time @xmath201 for the loss of coherence in position space can be much smaller than the relaxation time @xmath195 , but still longer than the decoherence time in momentum space @xmath194 .",
    "we have developed a stochastic unravelling of the quantum linear boltzmann equation which leads to an efficient monte carlo simulation technique , despite the appearance in the equation itself of quite complicated operator - valued expressions .",
    "the latter are responsible for deviations from gaussian statistics , at variance with typical master equations used for the description of quantum brownian motion .",
    "a crucial feature of the method is that the developed algorithms fully exploit the translation covariance and thus allow full three - dimensional stochastic simulations of the quantum boltzmann equation . in particular",
    ", the method does not require the introduction of a discretization in momentum space , so that the continuous sum over the lindblad operators in eq .",
    "can be exactly accounted for .",
    "the method proposed here suggests many further physically relevant applications .",
    "for example , one can extend the algorithm to the regime where effects from the bose or fermi statistics of the quantum gas come into play .",
    "in fact , starting from eqs .   and one can analytically work out the corresponding expressions of the dynamic structure factor for a free gas of particles obeying bose or fermi statistics , coming to @xcite @xmath202 }   { 1 \\mp z\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\beta}{8m}\\frac{(2me - q^2)^2}{q^2}\\right ] }   \\right ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the upper signs refer to the bose case and the lower signs to the fermi case , and @xmath203 denotes the fugacity of the gas . by use of this expression",
    "the algorithm thus enables monte carlo simulations of the behavior of test particles in a bose or fermi gas to identify genuine effects of the quantum statistics .",
    "more generally , the method may also be applied to an interacting quantum gas provided an ( at least approximate ) expression for the dynamic structure factor @xmath204 is known .",
    "a further example is the investigation of the important problem of decoherence in position space .",
    "this can be done by use of initial states representing superpositions of localized wave packets , with the aim of determining the corresponding position space decoherence time scales .",
    "localized wave packets may of course be represented by introducing a discretization of position space .",
    "however , it seems that it is much more efficient to invoke the translation covariance and to describe spatially localized states by appropriate superpositions of momentum eigenstates as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : decoherence ] , or , more generally , by superpositions of wave packets localized in momentum space .",
    "further examples of application include the extension of the method to the determination of multitime correlation functions , to the treatment of particles with internal degrees of freedom , and to the case of an operator - valued scattering amplitude , i.  e. to the case that the scattering cross section depends on the momentum of the incoming test particle ."
