    "geometry approaches have been applied to analyze rf energy harvesting performance in cellular network  @xcite , relay network  @xcite and cognitive radio network  @xcite .",

    "@xcite studies the impact of cooperative density and relay selection in a large - scale network with transmitter - receiver pairs distributed as ppp . the authors in  @xcite study a cognitive radio network where the primary and secondary networks are distributed as independent homogeneous ppps .",

    "the ambient rf sources are modeled with a ginibre @xmath0-dpp .",
    "the sensor transmits to the data sink using instant harvested rf energy .",

    "we consider a sensor node @xmath14 harvesting rf energy from ambient rf energy sources .",
    "we assume that the ambient rf energy sources are distributed as a ginibre @xmath0-dpp , which will be specified in detail in section  iii .",
    "we assume that the sensor node is solely powered by the harvested rf energy to supply its operations for data transmission .",
    "the sensor contains an energy harvester and an information transmitter , which are equipped with separated antennas , so that they can function independently and concurrently . in other words ,",
    "the sensor is able to perform data transmission and rf energy harvesting simultaneously .",
    "the instantaneous harvested energy is first used to operate the sensor circuit and then the surplus energy is provided for information transmission .    the rf energy harvesting rate by the sensor node @xmath14 from the rf energy source @xmath15 in a free - space channel @xmath16 can be obtained based on the friis equation  @xcite as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the rf - to - dc power conversion efficiency of the sensor node @xmath14 .",

    "are negatively correlated and the associated @xmath0-dpp is known to be locally gibbsian , see e.g.  @xcite , therefore it is a kind of repulsive point process .",
    "in particular , the ginibre @xmath0-dpp exhibits more repulsion when @xmath0 is close to @xmath63 . as @xmath64 , @xmath51 and @xmath62",
    "tend to not be correlated , and the corresponding point process converges to the ppp , c.f .",
    "@xcite .    we will write @xmath65 when @xmath30 is an @xmath0-dpp with kernel @xmath49 defined in and density with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath66 .",
    "the spectral theorem for hermitian and compact operators yields the following decomposition for the kernel of @xmath49 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a basis of @xmath69 , and @xmath70 the corresponding eigenvalues . in e.g.",
    "@xcite it is shown that the eigenvalues of the ginibre point process on @xmath71 are given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the lower incomplete gamma function .",
    "on the other hand , the eigenvectors of @xmath49 are given by @xmath74 we refer to  @xcite for further mathematical details on the ginibre point process .",
    "lastly , we emphasize that the ginibre @xmath0-dpp is stationary , in the sense that its distribution is invariant with respect to translations , c.f .  @xcite .",
