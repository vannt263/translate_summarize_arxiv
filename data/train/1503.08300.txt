    "the analysis of the chemical enrichment of galaxies is a powerful tool to constrain galaxy evolutionary processes .",
    "the content of metals in galaxies , both in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and in stars , depends critically on the past star formation history and on the net effect of outflows and inflows , which are some of the key mechanisms in shaping galaxy evolution . in order to extract valuable information from the observed metallicities ,",
    "it is crucial to compare them with the amount of metals expected to be produced by the integrated star formation .",
    "to achieve this is necessary to have accurate information on the amount of each chemical element injected into the ism by each type of star , i.e. the so - called stellar yields .",
    "generally , most observations provide information only on the global content of metals , or on a single chemical element which is taken as representative of the global metallicity ( by assuming that , for instance , the abundance of the various elements scales proportionally to the solar relative abundances ) .",
    "moreover , many studies do not deal with the relative delayed enrichment of different chemical species .",
    "therefore , the quantity that is often used is the so - called average _ yield per stellar generation _ , or _ net yield _",
    "( generally indicated as @xmath0 , or simply @xmath5 ) , which is the total mass of metals that a stellar population releases into the ism , normalized to the mass locked up into low - mass ( long - lived ) stars and stellar remnants .    ; the dashed line in red to @xmath6 ; the black dotted line to @xmath7 ; the dashed - dotted line in blue to @xmath8 , and the green squares to the stellar yields at @xmath9 . , width=351 ]",
    "historically , this approach was first used in the early work of @xcite , who derived the relation between gas phase metallicity z and gas fraction @xmath10 for a closed box model ( see @xcite , or @xcite for a detailed analysis ) : @xmath11 this simple model is based upon the assumptions that the galaxy is one - zone and closed ; the initial gas mass is of primordial chemical composition ; the initial mass function ( imf ) is invariant , and the mixing of the gas in the galaxy is always instantaneous and complete , and that metals are instantaneously recycled for the formation of the new generation of stars .",
    "the latter is dubbed `` instantaneous recycling approximation '' ( ira , @xcite ) . within this",
    "simplified ( but widely used ) approach the further approximation is that all stars with @xmath12 die instantaneously , while all stars with @xmath13 have infinite lifetime ; this way , the effect of stellar lifetimes in the equations can be neglected and the effect subsumed into a net _ return fraction _ ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "although the ira assumption is strong , it still represents a good approximation for those chemical elements produced and restored into the ism by stars with short lifetimes .",
    "the best example of such a chemical element is oxygen , which is also representative of the global metallicity z , since it is the most abundant heavy element by mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the ism evolution of chemical elements produced by long - lifetime sources can not be followed by analytical models working with the ira assumption .",
    "examples of such chemical elements are nitrogen and carbon , which are mainly synthesized by low- and intermediate - mass stars ( lims ) , and iron , mainly produced by type ia sne .",
    "to take into account the stellar lifetimes with a high level of detail , numerical models of chemical evolution should be used ( see @xcite ) .    ; the dotted line in black to @xmath7 ; the dashed - dotted line in blue to @xmath14 ; the solid line in magenta to @xmath15 ; the solid line in green to @xmath9 , and the solid line in cyan to the stellar yields at @xmath16 .",
    ", width=351 ]    the yield per stellar generation is a key in the context of analytical models of chemical evolution , even in the most complex ones , which include the effect of outflows and inflows , as well as variations of the star formation efficiency , i.e. normalization and slope of the relation between gas mass and star formation rate , ( see , for example , @xcite ) , as well as in numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the comparison of these models with the extensive observations that are providing metallicity measurements for large samples of galaxies locally and at high redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) enable us to provide important constraints on these various processes , _ modulo an accurate knowledge of the yield per stellar generation_.    in most of the studies , the yield per stellar generation is taken as a fixed value ( typically about @xmath17-@xmath18 ) , with this value changing from work to work .",
    "for example , a net yield of oxygen @xmath19 is assumed in @xcite , whereas @xmath20 in @xcite and @xmath21 in @xcite ; particularly high are the values @xmath22-@xmath18 assumed in @xcite , @xmath23 in @xcite , and @xmath24 in @xcite . however , since the net yield is a combination of yields from different stellar masses , it is clear that it must depend on the imf .",
    "this has sometimes been acknowledged ( e.g. @xcite ) , but never really taken into consideration when using the net yield in the various models . in particular ,",
    "several works derive the stellar mass and sfr by assuming a given imf and then adopt a fiducial net yield that is derived from a completely different imf .",
    "moreover , there is some evidence that the imf may vary in different classes of galaxies .",
    "this implies that different yields per stellar generation should be used .",
    "finally , since the stellar nucleosynthetic yield have a metallicity dependence , it is important to check the effect of metallicity on the imf - integrated net yield .    to tackle the issues presented above , in this article we calculate yields per stellar generation for the most commonly adopted imfs and investigate their metallicity dependence ( although the latter effect is shown to be minor ) , by comparing the results for two modern compilations of nucleosynthetic yields @xcite , which have been throughly tested in the past against the best available data for galaxies , although we remark on the fact that each of them is still affected by specific limitations ( as discussed in the following sections ) .",
    "we mostly focus on the yield of oxygen , which is the element which is most commonly used as a tracer of the global metallicity , and for which the ira approximation is appropriate .",
    "however , we will also provide the yield per stellar generation for the total mass of metals , although this should be used with caution , given the enrichment delay of various elements ( e.g. iron , nitrogen , carbon , etc ... ) , for which the ira approximation is arguable .    in section [ definitions ]",

    "this fact could add an extra systematic to studies attempting to model the observed abundances , which should be taken into account by properly using our compilation of yield for the different classes of galaxies . more specifically ,",
    "if the imf is not universal , we can expect a difference in net yield up to a factor larger than three for classical , widely - used imfs , and even much larger for top - heavy imfs .",
    "the blooming of extensive spectroscopic surveys of local and distant galaxies have fostered the use of metallicities to constrain the star formation history , feedback processes ( outflows ) and gas inflows across the cosmic epoch , by comparing the observations with the expectations of analytical and numerical models .",
    "one key element in such a comparison is the yield per stellar generation , which is often assumed as a fixed value . in this article , we have used a numerical code of chemical evolution , which includes modern stellar nucleosynthetic yields , to explore the effect of the metallicity and imf on the net yield of oxygen per stellar generation and on the return mass fraction ; our results have shown that the yield can change by large factors . therefore ,",
    "if the yield associated with the appropriate imf is not used , this can produce inconsistent results and large systematic errors .",
    "we have provided results for two different sets of stellar yields , which are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the former is an inhomogeneous set , since it combines results of hydrostatic burning in rotating massive stars ( he , c , n , and o from geneva stellar models ) with results of explosive burning without stellar rotation ( heavier elements from @xcite ) , which is  in principle  an incorrect treatment . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite is a homogeneous set of stellar yields , with the only limitation of not including the effect of stellar rotation , expected to have a strong impact at the very low metallicities .",
    "we have found that the uncertainty introduced by assuming different sets of stellar yields can be quantified by @xmath181 .",
    "the effect of assuming different imfs can cause large differences in the net oxygen yield .",
    "we have found that the @xcite and @xcite predict the highest oxygen yield , roughly a factor of two higher than for a @xcite imf . on the other hand , by assuming a @xcite imf , we obtain the smallest net yield , roughly a factor of two lower than for a @xcite imf .",
    "the yield per stellar generation also depends significantly on the upper mass cutoff of the imf .",
    "the differences between the case with @xmath34 and @xmath172 are of the order of a factor of two with the @xcite . since the imf of @xcite predicts a larger number of massive stars , that difference is doubled with this imf , whereas it is halved with the @xcite imf , which predicts the lowest number of massive stars .",
    "if one takes into account both the variation with imf shape and upper stellar mass cutoff , _ the variation of the yield per stellar generation can span more than a factor of ten .",
    "_    we note that populations of highly enriched galaxies  whose metallicities were deemed uncomfortably high  can be easily explained by means of a large yield per stellar generation , as the one associated with commonly used imfs , such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similarly , our results should warn about a proper use of the so - called _ effective yield _ , @xmath182 , which is observationally derived by inverting equation ( [ eq : simple ] ) .",
    "in particular , the finding of @xmath183 is generally modelled in terms of enriched outflows , inflow of pristine gas , or both ( e.g. @xcite ) , whereas the finding of @xmath184 is sometimes used as an indicator of inaccurate metallicity measurements or inappropriate metallicity calibrations .",
    "we conclude that the deviation of @xmath185 from a `` fiducial '' , `` true '' yield also may be partly associated with imf being different than assumed . for the same reason , high values of the the effective yield ( and in particular @xmath186 ) may be indicative of an imf favouring massive stars @xcite and/or of an high mass cutoff of the imf itself . by assuming single - slope top - heavy imfs , such as the ones proposed by @xcite or @xcite",
    ", we find very high values for the yields of oxygen per stellar generation , which are also slightly influenced by the metallicity - dependence of the stellar yields .",
    "the dependence on metallicity of the yield is reassuringly small . a significant variation is only found at extremely low metallicities ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "although the latter result may be an important aspect to take into account for models of primordial galaxies , it strongly relies on the assumed set of stellar yields , which are particularly affected by uncertainties at extremely low metallicities .",
    "we remind the reader that ira provides correct results only for chemical elements restored into the ism on short typical time - scales ; oxygen represents the best example of such a chemical element , since it is also the most abundant metal by mass in the universe . on the other hand , analytical models working under ira assumption",
    "fail in following the evolution of chemical elements produced by long - lifetime sources ; examples of such chemical elements are carbon , nitrogen and iron .",
    "hence we warn the reader against a blind application of ira for the total mass of metals . in order to take into account the lifetimes of the various stellar producers in detail , numerical models of chemical evolution",
    "should be used .    our compilation of numerical values of the yield per stellar generation , for different imfs , different upper mass cutoffs and different metallicities",
    ", will hopefully be useful to properly investigate the metallicity in galaxies across cosmic epochs , by tackling one of the ( generally not acknowledged ) major sources of uncertainty .",
