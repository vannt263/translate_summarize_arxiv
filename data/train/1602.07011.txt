    "low - amplitude radial velocity ( rv ) variations are common among evolved k and m giant stars and these have both long ( hundreds of days ) and short ( hours to days ) time scales .",
    "short - term variations are most likely caused by sun - like oscillations excited by turbulent convection and by convective motions in the outer convective zone .",

    "if @xmath0  uma b were an evolved star with high luminosity , then we should see its spectral features in our data .",

    "after removing the rv signals of 230 and 471 days , the dispersion of the rv residuals is 192.3 m s@xmath7 , which is significantly higher than the rv precision for the rv standard star @xmath16  ceti ( @xmath27  m  s@xmath7 ) or the typical internal error of individual rv accuracy of @xmath28  m  s@xmath7 of @xmath0  uma .",

    ", we will test different assumptions about the nature of the second 471-day periodicity and the reasons for large scatter in the residuals from the two - period solution .",
    "we analyzed the _",
    "photometry @xcite for @xmath0  uma . for three years , between jd2447879 and jd2448978 , the _ hipparcos _ satellite obtained 92 photometric measurements for @xmath0  uma with an rms scatter of 0.0168 mag , corresponding to 0.53% variations .",

    "there are a few significant peaks near the periods of 102 , 116 , and 1506 days with faps of @xmath17 5 @xmath30 .",
    "after removing nominally the most significant period of 1506 days , we found a period of 116 days , irrelevant to the rv signals .",
    "the _ hipparcos _",
    "photometry is unable to provide information on the possible origin of the rv variations .",
    "almost simultaneously , between jd2447875 and jd2449149 , @xmath0 uma was observed in the near - infrared ( nir ) 1.25 , 2.2 , 3.5 , and 4.9@xmath0 bands by nasa s _ cobe _ ( cosmic background explorer ) satellite with the _ dirbe _ ( diffuse infrared background experiment ) instrument .",
    "the total number of 76 weekly averaged fluxes in each band were extracted for @xmath0  uma from the _ cobe / dirbe _ archives @xcite .",
    "the l - s periodogram analysis of the 1.25 , 2.2 , 3.5 , and 4.9@xmath0 fluxes does not reveal any significant signals in the domain of interest ( fig .",
    "[ dirbe ] ) .",
    "periodic rv variations can be produced by the rotational modulation of surface features or by pulsations .",
    "surface features such as spots or non - radial pulsations cause an asymmetric , periodic distortion in the line profile , which can be detected by line bisector analysis .",
    "the difference in the bisectors of line widths between the top and bottom of the line profile is defined as the bisector velocity span ( bvs ) .",
    "the changes in the spectral line bisector can also be quantified using the bisector velocity curvature ( bvc ) .    in choosing the points defining the bisector span , it is important to avoid the wings and cores of the profile where the errors of the bisector measurements are large and noisy .",
    "to search for variations in the spectral line shapes for @xmath0  uma , line bisector variations were computed for a strong and unblended spectral line with a high flux level , namely ni i 6643.6  as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the selected line shows a high flux level and is located beyond the i@xmath15 absorption region so that contamination should not affect our bisector measurements .",
    "we estimated the bisector variations of the profile between two different flux levels at 0.8 and 0.4 of the central depth as the span points .",
    "the l - s periodograms of the line bisector variations for @xmath0  uma are shown in fig .",
    "even though the bvs does not show any obvious peak , the bvc indicates a peak near the period of 463.6 days with a fap of @xmath2@xmath31 .",
    "this suggests that rv variations are accompanied by line - shape changes .",
    "magnetic fields , which are generated by turbulence in the outer convection zone , cause a very broad range of surface phenomena , such as sunspots , plages , and flares .",
    "stellar activity refers to similar features that occur in late - type stars that have an outer convection zone .",
    "thus , the nature of stellar activity is related to the existence and depth of an outer convection zone .",
    "the depth depends on the spectral type : f type stars have shallow convection zones while middle m type stars are totally convective .",
    "substitution of basic stellar parameters for @xmath0 uma a ( see table[tab1 ] ) into @xcite s calibration of @xmath32/@xmath33 @xmath28 0.0025 @xmath34 ( @xmath33/@xmath35 )  ( @xmath36/@xmath37 )  ( @xmath1/@xmath38 ) yields an expected sizes for the surface granulation of @xmath280.378 @xmath33 , approximately corresponding to eight large convection cells across the visible equator of the star .    frequently used optical chromospheric activity indicators are the ew variations of ca ii h & k , h@xmath4 , mg  i  b triplet , he  i  d@xmath39 , na  i  d@xmath40 & d@xmath15 , h@xmath3 , and ca ii infrared triplet ( irt ) lines .",
    "the behaviours of the different optical chromospheric activity indicators reflect the atmospheric condition at different atmospheric heights : na i d@xmath40 & d@xmath15 and mg  i  b triplet for the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere , ca  ii  irt lines for the lower chromosphere , h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , ca  ii  h & k for the middle chromosphere and he i d@xmath39 for the upper chromosphere .    of these , the most common indicator of chromospheric activity is the well - known s - index of the ca ii h & k lines @xcite , which is well studied for f to k type stars .",
    "the ca  ii  h & k line region for @xmath0 uma obtained by the boes does not have a sufficient s / n ratio to estimate ew variations .",
    "another ca  ii  indicator , the ca  ii  irt lines , has also been measured @xcite .",
    "changes in the core profile of the ca ii irt reflect variations in stellar chromospheric activity and qualitatively related to the variations in the ca ii h & k flux @xcite .",
    "however , it also is not suitable because saturation of our ccd spectra is seen at wavelengths longer than around 6800   .",
    "the na i d@xmath40 & d@xmath15 and mg  i  b triplet lines are excluded from the study because they are located inside i@xmath15 molecular region .    in this work , we thus selected the h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 lines as chromospheric indicators .",
    "the h@xmath3 is believed to have a strong correlation with the ca ii index @xcite and is sensitive to the atmospheric stellar activity @xcite .",
    "it is often used as a chromospheric indicator @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath4 absorption line was also measured , which originates in the middle layers of stellar atmosphere and is sensitive to the stellar activity . in figure  [ h_a ] and [ h_b ] ,",
    "the shapes of the h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 ew variations are superimposed on each other .",
    "we measured the ews using a band pass of @xmath11 1.0 @xmath13 for h@xmath3 and @xmath11 0.8 @xmath13 for h@xmath4 centered on the core of the lines to avoid nearby blending lines and atm h@xmath15o absorption lines .",
    "the l - s periodograms of the h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 ew variations for @xmath0  uma are shown in fig .",
    "[ h_power ] .",
    "both periodograms show a large power at @xmath2473 days , close to the rv period of 471.2 days .",
    "we found long - term rv variations in the spectroscopic binary m giant @xmath0  uma .",
    "two periodic signals are present in the data , one at 471.2 days and another at 230.0 days .",
    "the 230-d period is due to a known stellar companion .",
    "the nature of the longer period variations was assessed using ancillary data .",
    "line bisector variations may arise from variations of the instrumental profile ( ip ) as well as stellar variations .",
    "generally , the line bisector variations of ip can be significant , but they are typically much lower than the errors in the line bisectors determined from the stellar spectra .",
    "while our bisector analysis showed that the amplitude variations are smaller than those of the rv , it revealed variations of @xmath245.8 m s@xmath7 ( bvs ) and of @xmath265.0 m s@xmath7 ( bvc ) .",
    "the boes exhibits a slightly unstable ip variation due to the possible mechanical , thermal and ambient air pressure instabilities from season to season .",
    "we examined the stability of the instrumental precision by measuring the bisectors on the reference star @xmath16 ceti .",
    "bisector measurements taken on the same , or consecutive nights ( 14 spectra during jd 2456552.2059 and 24556555.3222 ) show bvs variations of @xmath239 m s@xmath7 and bvc variations of @xmath235  m  s@xmath7 . considering that the long - term precision is probably worse , the bisector variations due to instrumental effects are comparable to the variations measured for @xmath0  uma .",
    "normally this would indicate no significant bisector variations in @xmath0  uma ; however , bvc variations are seen with a period of 463 days , very close to the secondary period of 471 days seen in rv variations .",
    "we note that the instrumental bvc variations are about a factor of two smaller than the bvc variations in @xmath0  uma , so the bvc variations seen in @xmath0  uma are probably real .",
    "stellar activity , such as spots , plage , and filaments , can induce rv variations that can mask or even mimic the rv signature of orbiting companions . since we were unable to use the ca ii h & k lines as indicators due to the poor s / n ratio of our spectra in this wavelength region , we selected hydrogen lines for the activity indicators .",
    "we found that @xmath0  uma shows a prominent power in the ew variations of the h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 lines , possibly indicating a high level of stellar activity .",
    "two hydrogen lines show period ( @xmath2473 days ) consistent to the 471-d period seen in the rvs of @xmath0  uma .",
    "hydrogen lines can be signatures of stellar chromospheric activity and h@xmath3 surveys have shown that the velocity structure of the chromosphere is reflected in the h@xmath3 profile .",
    "in particular , the h@xmath3 line is sensitive to chromospheric structure and conditions in cool giant and supergiant stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , the secondary rv period of 471 days may very well be due to chromospheric activity .",
    "the stellar rotational period can be important in identifying the origins of rv variations @xcite . from the measured projected rotational velocities , the stellar radius , and the stellar inclination , we can derive the range for the stellar rotational period .",
    "assuming that the stellar inclination is the same as the orbital inclination ( i.e. aligned angular momentum vectors ) , the stellar rotational period is    @xmath41@xmath33/[@xmath42 sin(@xmath25 ) ] = 118  @xmath43 days .",
    "+ -15pt interestingly , the _ hipparcos _ photometry shows a significant period at 116 days , consistent with the estimated rotational period .    there seems to be a discrepancy between the estimated stellar rotational period and the 471-d rv period .",
    "the latter is found in activity indicators which nominally indicates rotational modulation at the stellar rotational period .",
    "there are several ways to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "first , the stellar spin axis of the star may not be aligned with the orbital axis .",
    "rossiter - mclaughlin measurements of eclipsing binaries have found such mis - aligned systems @xcite .",
    "if the stellar spin axis actually has an inclination of @xmath2870@xmath44 , then the rotational and rv period are consistent .",
    "second , the 116-d period found in the _ hipparcos _ photometry may actually be a harmonic of the true rotational period .",
    "one - fourth of the 471-d rv period is 118 d. possibly the spot distribution at the time of the _ hipparcos _ measurements consisted of four spots equally spaced in longitude .",
    "this would result in one - fourth of the true rotational period .",
    "finally , it may be that the 471-d period is actually not the rotation period of the star .",
    "using @xmath6 = 1148 and @xmath45 = 3899  k for @xmath0  uma a @xcite , we can locate it in the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram at the domain of an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star .",
    "substitution of masses of @xmath0  uma a and @xmath0  uma b to the eggleton s approximate formulae @xcite yields the roche lobe radius @xmath46 = 0.40 in units of orbital separation or equal to 0.39 au . the radius of @xmath0  uma a is @xmath47 = 74.7@xmath35 or 0.347 au .",
    "this turns out that @xmath0  uma a is an agb star which is close to filling its roche lobe .",
    "pulsations in agb stars are quit common phenomenon and there is still a mysterious `` sequence d '' group among them , showing a long secondary period ( lsp ; @xmath48  400 days ) that follow a period - luminosity relation @xcite .",
    "a `` sequence d '' star show evidence of warm chromosphere through strong and variable h@xmath3 line absorption that varies in phase with lsp @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the nature of the long secondary period of @xmath28471 days and variations in the hydrogen lines may relate @xmath0  uma a closely to the `` sequence d '' variable agb stars , although it does not show short - period pulsations .",
    "the origin of existence of `` sequence d '' agb stars is yet to be explained . according to @xcite ,",
    "the most likely explanation is that the lsps result from a low degree @xmath49 modes confined to the outer layer of the red giant , combined with a large - scale stellar spot activity that gives rise to an observed chromosphere and the irregularity of the light curve .",
    "@xcite found from the theoretical models that `` sequence d '' period - luminosity relation is roughly consistent with the predictions for dipole oscillatory convective modes in agb models .",
    "figure  [ h_ew+rv1 ] shows schematics of the secondary rv of @xmath0  uma and the h@xmath3 ew and h@xmath4 ew variation cycle of the host star as a function of the time .",
    "the ew variations show a time delay of @xmath290 days ( 0.19 phase ) relative to the rv variations . for completeness",
    ", we would like to mention that pulsations of extended atmospheres of an agb star can also explain the 0.19 phase lag between the rv and the ew variations of hydrogen lines and the metallic line bisector variations in @xmath0  uma .",
    "rvs are the mirror image of the optical flux variations in the pulsating stars .",
    "thus , in the case of pulsations in @xmath0  uma , the ew maximum ( see figure10 ) should precede the optical flux variations by about 0.25 phase .",
    "earlier , @xcite detected a phase lag between the 706-day secondary variations in the h@xmath3 ew and the 1.25@xmath0 flux in the exoplanet host k giant hd  66141 .",
    "the h@xmath3 line ew variations in hd  66141 precede the 1.25@xmath0 flux maximum by 0.18 phase , very close to the observed value found in @xmath0  uma .",
    "observations of other m giants and mira variables at different wavelengths show phase lags with the ew maximum appearing about 0.18 phase before the maximum at 1.25@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such phase lags in oxygen - rich miras are likely due to titanium oxide ( tio ) variability @xcite .",
    "considering all these lead us to conclude that the rv and the ew variations in the spectroscopic binary m giant @xmath0  uma a originate from complex pulsations and the chromospheric activity .",
    "additional rv measurements with contemporaneous photometric measurements will confirm the nature of secondary long - period variations for this star .",
