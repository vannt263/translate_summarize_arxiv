    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems are among the most widely studied problems in physics , especially due to their invaluable pedagogical properties and their more friendly manipulation of mathematical expressions both analytically and numerically , which often guide us through the understanding of interesting physical systems @xcite . furthermore",

    "another example is the application of dmrg methods in the limit of strong interactions @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in how well dmrg performs in dealing with continuous systems in the strongly interacting limit .",
    "interest in this setup goes beyond its experimental realization @xcite , and arises also from the fact that an exact solution for such systems is available @xcite .",

    "this would allow one to address many observables and use the fact that dmrg is accurate and can be scaled to larger system sizes for spin models than typical exact diagonalization routines which are exponentially slow for longer spin chains .",
    "more generally , one may also consider an approach where one expands the hamiltonian in a basis set @xcite . in an occupation number basis one may then by appropriate truncation produce lattice models that can be solved using a dmrg routine .",
    "it would be very interesting to compare the latter method to the results of the lattice spin model for very strong interactions in order to test how well it performs as one approaches the strongly interacting regime .",

    "<S> we investigate one - dimensional harmonically trapped two - component systems for repulsive interaction strengths ranging from the non - interacting to the strongly interacting regime for fermi - fermi mixtures . </S>",
    "<S> a new and powerful mapping between the interaction strength parameters from a continuous hamiltonian and a discrete lattice hamiltonian is derived . as an example , we show that this mapping does not depend neither on the state of the system nor on the number of particles . energies , density profiles and correlation functions are obtained both numerically ( dmrg and exact diagonalization ) and analytically . since dmrg results do not converge as the interaction strength is increased , analytical solutions are used as a benchmark to identify the point where these calculations become unstable . </S>",
    "<S> we use the proposed mapping to set a quantitative limit on the interaction parameter of a discrete lattice hamiltonian above which dmrg gives unrealistic results . </S>"
