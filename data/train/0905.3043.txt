    "the major atmospheric gamma imaging cherenkov ( magic ) telescope is a last - generation instrument for very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray observation exploiting the imaging air cherenkov ( iac ) technique .",
    "this kind of instrument images the cherenkov light produced in the particle cascade initiated by a @xmath0-ray in the atmosphere .",
    "located on the roque de los muchachos observatory , in la palma ( spain ) , magic incorporates a number of technological improvements in its design and achieves the lowest energy threshold ( 55  gev with the nominal trigger , 25  gev with the pulsar trigger  @xcite ) among instruments of its kind .",
    "magic signal digitization utilizes 2gsample / s flash analog - to - digital converters , and timing parameters are used during the data analysis  @xcite , yielding a sensitivity ( at a flux peak energy of 280gev ) of 1.6@xmath1 of the crab nebula flux in 50 hours of observations.the relative energy resolution above 200  gev is better than 30@xmath1 .",
    "the angular resolution is @xmath2 , while source localization in the sky is provided with a precision of @xmath3 .",
    "magic is also unique among iac telescopes by its capability to operate under moderate illumination  @xcite ( i.e.  moon or twilight ) .",
    "this allows to increase the duty cycle by a factor 1.5 and a better sampling of variable sources is possible .",
    "the construction of a second telescope is now in its final stage and magic will start stereoscopic observations in the following weeks .",
    "magic has been operating since fall 2004 , developing a physics program which includes both , topics of fundamental physics and astrophysics . in this paper",
    "we highlight magic latest contributions to extragalactic @xcite and galactic @xcite astrophysics .",

    "their two - bumped spectral energy distributions ( sed ) are characterized by a second peak at very high @xmath0-ray energies . in synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc )",
    "models this peak is assumed to be due to the inverse - compton ( ic ) of electrons , by upscattering previously produced synchrotron photons to high energies . in hadronic models , instead , interactions of a highly relativistic jet outflow with ambient matter , proton - induced cascades , or synchrotron radiation off protons , are the origin of the high - energy photons .",
    "another defining property of blazars is the high variability of their emission ranging from radio to @xmath0-rays . for vhe @xmath0-ray blazars , correlations between x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission",
    "have been found on time scales ranging from @xmath4 minutes to days and months ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , although the correlations have proven to be rather complicated @xcite .",
    "here we present selected results from multi - wavelength ( mwl ) campaigns with magic participation and for observations of the agn mkn  501 , m87 ( february 2008 ) , 1es1011 + 496 , s50716 + 71 , and 3c279 .      for an advanced understanding of blazars , coordinated simultaneous mwl observations are essential , as they allow the determination of seds spanning over 15 orders of magnitude in energy . in the 2006/7 season ,",
    "magic participated in multiwavelength - campaigns carried out on the blazars mkn 421 , mkn 501 , pg 1553 + 113 , 1es 1218 + 304 , 1h 1426 + 428 , and the radio galaxy m87 .",

    "we discuss some of the campaigns in more detail here .",
    "the observations of mkn501 in july 2006 revealed the lowest x - ray and vhe state ever observed .",
    "no variability in vhe @xmath0-rays was found , while an overall increase of about 50% during one day was seen in x - rays .",
    "a one - zone ssc model describes this quiescent state of mkn501 well @xcite .",
    "campaigns on 1es1218 + 304 and 1h1426 + 428 have been carried out , during both of which significant x - ray variability has been observed .",
    "mkn 421 was observed together with _ integral _ , _ suzaku _ and _ swift _ and showed interesting intra - day variability during some of the observation nights .",
    "the vhe data of these observations are currently being analyzed .",
    "a more recent observation of a flare of mkn 421 in summer 2008 could be followed accurately from optical to vhe @xmath0 rays , with the participation of agile , gasp - webt , veritas and magic @xcite . during the first multi - wavelength campaign ever on pg 1553 + 113 in july 2006",
    ", its vhe emission showed no variability @xcite .",
    "1es1959 + 650 showed vhe data among the lowest flux state observed from this object , while at the same time a relatively high optical and x - ray flux ( both _ suzaku _ and _ swift _ ) was found @xcite .",
    "the sed could be modeled using similar parameters as needed for the sed measured in 2002 , with a slightly more compact source and a slightly lower magnetic field .",

    "_ observations . for the first time , magic determined the energy spectrum below 250 gev @xcite , which can be described by a power law with a spectral index of @xmath7 .",
    "we did not measure a high - energy cut - off , but found a marginal spectral hardening , which may be interpreted as a similarity to other blazars detected at vhe , where such hardening has often been observed @xcite .",
    "our analysis revealed a variable ( 5.6@xmath6 ) night - to - night @xmath0-ray flux above 350 gev , while no variability was found for 150350 gev ( fig .",

    "whereas at the same time the core luminosity reached a historical maximum ( d. harris , priv .",
    "this strongly supports the core as the vhe @xmath0-ray emission region .",
    "magic observed the bright and variable vhe @xmath0-ray emitter mkn  501 during six weeks in summer 2005 @xcite . in two of the observation nights , the recorded flux ( @xmath12 that of the crab nebula ) revealed rapid changes with doubling times as short as 3 minutes or less .",
    "for the first time , short ( @xmath13  20 min ) vhe @xmath0-ray flares with a resolved time structure could be used for detailed studies of particle acceleration and cooling timescales .",
    "interestingly the flares in the two nights behave differently : while the 2005 june 30 flare is only visible in 250gev1.2tev , the 2005 july 9 flare is apparent in all energy bands ( 120  gev to @xmath141.2  tev )",
    ". additionally , a photon - by - photon analysis of the july 9 flare @xcite revealed a time delay between the flare peak at different energies : at a zero - delay probability of @xmath15 , a marginal time delay of @xmath16 towards higher energies was found using two independent analyses , both exploiting the full statistical power of the dataset .",
    "several explanations for this delay have been considered up to now : ( 1 ) particles inside the emission region moving with constant doppler factor need some time to be accelerated to energies that enable them to produce the highest energy @xmath0 rays @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the @xmath0-ray emission has been captured in the initial acceleration phase of the relativistic blob in the jet , which at any point in time radiates up to highest @xmath0-ray energies possible @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) a one - zone ssc model , which invokes a brief episode of increased particle injection at low energies @xcite . ( 4 )",
    "an energy - dependent speed of photons in vacuum @xcite , as predicted in some models of quantum gravity @xcite . when assuming a simultaneous emission of the @xmath0-rays ( of different energies ) at the source , a lower limit of @xmath17  gev ( 95% c.l .",
    ") can be established @xcite .",
    "magic has been performing target of opportunity observations upon high optical states of known or potential vhe blazars . up to now",
    ", this strategy has proven very successful with the discovery of mkn 180 @xcite , 1es 1011 + 496 @xcite , and recently s50716 + 71 @xcite .",
    "the 18.7-h observation of 1es 1011 + 496 was triggered by an optical outburst in march 2007 , resulting in a 6.2@xmath6 detection at @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "an indication for an optical  vhe correlation is given , in that in spring 2007 the vhe @xmath0-ray flux is > 40% higher than in spring 2006 , where magic observed the blazar as part of a systematic search for vhe emission from a sample of x - ray bright ( @xmath19@xmath14@xmath20 ) hbls @xcite . in april 2008 ,",
    "a high optical state of the blazar s5  0716 + 71 , triggered magic observations , which resulted in a the detection of a strong 6.8@xmath6 signal in 2.6h , corresponding to a flux of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the source was also in a high x - ray state @xcite .",
    "the determination of the before - unknown redshifts of 1es1011 + 496 ( @xmath22 , @xcite ) and s50716 + 71 ( @xmath23 , @xcite ) makes these objects the third - most and second - most distant tev blazars after 3c279 , respectively .",
    "observations of 3c  279 , the brightest egret agn @xcite , revealed a 5.77@xmath6 post - trial detection on 2006 february 23 supported by a marginal signal on the preceding night @xcite . the overall probability for a zero - flux lightcurve can be rejected on the 5.04@xmath6 level .",
    "simultaneous optical @xmath24-band observations found 3c  279 in a high optical state , a factor of 2 above its long - term baseline flux , but with no indication of short time - scale variability .",
    "the observed vhe spectrum can be described by a power law with a differential photon spectral index of @xmath25 between 75 and 500 gev ( fig .",
    "[ fig:279 ] ) .",
    "the measured integrated flux above 100  gev on 23  february is @xmath26 photons @xmath27 s@xmath28 .",
    "vhe observations of sources as distant as 3c  279 ( @xmath29 ) were until recently deemed impossible due to the expected strong attenuation of the @xmath0-ray flux by the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , resulting in an exponential decrease with energy and a cutoff in the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "the observed vhe spectrum is sensitive to the ebl between @xmath30 .",
    "the reconstructed intrinsic spectrum of 3c  279 is difficult to reconcile with models predicting high ebl densities ( e.g. , the fast - evolution model of @xcite ) , while low - level models , e.g. @xcite , are still viable . assuming a maximum intrinsic photon index of @xmath31 , an upper ebl limit is inferred , leaving a small allowed region for the ebl .    the results support , at higher redshift , the conclusion drawn from earlier measurements @xcite that the observations of the _ hubble space telescope _ and _ spitzer _ correctly estimate most of the light sources in the universe .",
