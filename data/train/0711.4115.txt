    "path integrals have illuminated many aspects of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory @xcite , but there remain some challenges to path integral formulations of quantum theories @xcite . in this proceedings contribution",
    "i describe a problem arising for quantum mechanical potentials that are ` half - binding ' ( the definition of this term will be given below ) .",
    "i shall demonstrate that the naive semi - classical approximation to the path integral breaks down for two reasons : the leading contribution to the partition function is singular and the first variation of the action does not vanish for all variations preserving the boundary conditions .",
    "i discuss how both issues can be resolved by adding an appropriate ( hamilton - jacobi ) counterterm as boundary term to the action .",
    "moreover , i shall point out formal similarities to black hole ( bh ) partition functions , so in that sense these quantum mechanical systems may serve as toy models to elucidate certain aspects of bh physics . for sake of clarity",
    "i focus on a specific hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is restricted to positive values . if @xmath1 is small the hamiltonian rises without bound , like for a binding potential .",
    "if @xmath1 is large the potential is negligible , and the asymptotic dynamics is dominated by free propagation .",
    "i refer to a potential with these properties as ` half - binding ' .",
    "[ the conformal properties @xcite of will not play any role in this discussion . ]",
    "consistency of the variational principle based on the lagrangian action , @xmath2=\\int\\limits_{t_i}^{t_f}\\!dt \\,\\big(\\frac{\\dot{q}^2}{2}-\\frac{1}{q^2}\\big ) \\,,\\ ] ] requires to fix the initial and final value of @xmath1 at @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "i am interested here mostly in the limit @xmath5 , which implies that @xmath6 is the appropriate asymptotic boundary condition .",
    "the initial time is set to zero , @xmath7 , without loss of generality .",
    "the lagrangian path integral , @xmath8 \\big)\\,,\\ ] ] consists of a coherent sum over all field configurations consistent with the boundary data .",
    "even though is exactly soluble , it is illustrative to consider the semi - classical expansion of the action , @xmath9 = i[q_{\\rm cl } ] + \\delta i\\big|_{\\rm eom }   + { \\cal o}(\\delta q^2 ) \\,,\\ ] ] and of the partition function @xmath10\\big ) \\ , \\int { \\mathcal{d}}\\delta q \\ ,",
    "\\exp\\big(-\\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\,{\\cal o}(\\delta q^2 ) \\big ) \\,.\\ ] ] the semi - classical approximation is well - defined only if the on - shell action is bounded , @xmath11|<\\infty$ ] , and only if the first variation of the action vanishes on - shell , @xmath12 , for all field configurations preserving the boundary conditions .",
    "i demonstrate now that neither is the case for the example .",
    "the on - shell action diverges because asymptotically the propagation is essentially free , and because of the assumption @xmath5 .",
    "this is an idealization of situations where boundary conditions are imposed at late times , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 . in that case",
    "also @xmath15 classically .",
    "however , the path integral does not only take into account classical contributions , but also samples nearby field configurations whose asymptotic behavior is @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 is finite .",
    "therefore , the first variation of the action , evaluated on - shell , is given by the boundary term @xmath18\\big|^{t_f}\\neq 0\\,.\\ ] ] the inequality emerges , because arbitrary finite variations @xmath19 certainly preserve the boundary condition @xmath6 . and @xmath20 the correct asymptotic boundary condition is @xmath21 and therefore also @xmath22 .",
    "but now the momentum @xmath23 ( and thus @xmath24 ) diverges at the boundary , so that the expression @xmath25 becomes undefined and does not necessarily vanish for all variations preserving the boundary conditions . ] the two problems described here spoil the semi - classical approximation to the partition function .",
    "both problems can be solved by considering an improved action @xmath26 = \\int\\limits_{0}^{t_f}\\ !",
    "dt \\,\\big(\\frac{\\dot{q}^2}{2}-\\frac{1}{q^2}\\big ) - { s}(q , t)\\big|^{t_f}_{0}\\,,\\ ] ] which differs from by a boundary counterterm depending solely on quantities that are kept fixed at the boundary .",
    "the variation of , @xmath27 does not necessarily suffer from the second problem if @xmath28 asymptotically behaves like @xmath29 , i.e. , like the momentum @xmath30 .",
    "the method @xcite that i am going to review does not involve the subtraction of the action evaluated on a specific field configuration , but rather is intrinsic .",
    "moreover , the amount of guesswork is minimal : hamilton s principal function is a well - known function of the boundary data with the property @xmath31 .",
    "therefore it is natural to postulate that @xmath32 in solves the hamilton - jacobi equation , @xmath33    the complete integral @xcite @xmath34 allows to construct the enveloping solution one is forced to take the enveloping solution , since @xmath32 is part of the definition of the improved action and therefore can not depend on constants of motion .",
    "the energy @xmath35 is eliminated from by solving @xmath36 for @xmath35 .",
    "the other constant , @xmath37 , is set to zero by hand , but other choices are possible .",
    "such an ambiguity always remains in this ( and any other ) approach .",
    "it reflects the freedom to shift the free energy of the ground state . ]",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "the asymptotic expansion @xmath40 is consistent with the intuitive idea that the asymptotically free propagation is the source of all subtleties .",
    "but the expression contains a great deal of additional ( non - asymptotic ) information , which can be physically relevant , as mentioned in the next section .",
    "let me now come back to the two problems .",
    "since asymptotically @xmath41 , the on - shell action @xmath42 evidently is finite .",
    "the terms of order of unity entail the information about the potential @xmath43 .",
    "the first variation @xmath44 vanishes for all variations preserving the boundary conditions .",
    "the two problems mentioned in the previous section indeed are resolved by the improved action with .",
    "the considerations above apply in the same way to the hamiltonian with a more general class of half - binding potentials @xmath43 . in particular ,",
    "the ( manifestly positive ) potential @xmath43 is required to be monotonically decreasing , and to vanish faster than @xmath45 for large @xmath1 .",
    "going through the same steps as above is straightforward .",
    "other generalizations , e.g.  to non - monotonic potentials or potentials with coulomb - like behavior , may involve technical refinements , but the general procedure is always the same : one has to solve the hamilton - jacobi equation to obtain the correct counterterm @xmath32 in .",
    "the same issues as in the previous section arise when evaluating bh partition functions .",
    "probably the simplest non - trivial model is 2-dimensional dilaton gravity ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite for recent reviews ) , @xmath46 = - \\frac{1}{16\\pi g_2}\\,\\int_{{\\mathcal{m } } } \\!\\ !",
    "d^{\\,2}x \\,\\sqrt{g}\\ , \\left ( x\\,r - u(x)\\ ,          \\left(\\nabla x\\right)^2 - 2 \\ , v(x ) \\raisebox{12pt}{~}\\right ) \\\\           -   \\frac{1}{8\\pi g_2}\\ , \\int_{{\\partial { \\mathcal{m } } } } { \\!\\!\\!}dx \\ , \\sqrt{\\gamma}\\,x\\,k ~.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] an explanation of the notation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the boundary term in is the dilaton gravity analog of the gibbons - hawking - york boundary term .",
    "the latter arises in quantum mechanics if one converts the action @xmath47 $ ] into standard form , but it is _ not _ related to the hamilton - jacobi counterterm .",
    "it was shown first ( second ) in the second ( first ) order formulation @xcite ( @xcite ) that the improved action is given by @xmath48 = i[g , x ] + \\frac{1}{8\\pi g_2}\\ , \\int_{{\\partial { \\mathcal{m } } } } { \\!\\!\\!}dx \\,\\sqrt{\\gamma }   \\ ,   { s}(x ) \\,,\\ ] ] with the solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50 the lower integration constant in the integrals over the function @xmath51 is always the same and therefore cancels ; the lower integration constant in the remaining integral represents the ambiguity mentioned in footnote [ fn:1 ] .",
    "yields @xmath52 $ ] , which reveals that the hamilton - jacobi counterterm @xmath53 is the supergravity pre - potential ( up to a numerical factor ) @xcite",
    ". a similar ( pseudo-)supersymmetric story exists in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "cf .  also @xcite . ]    the bh partition function based upon the improved action , @xmath54\\big ) \\approx",
    "\\exp\\big(- \\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\,\\gamma[\\,g_{\\rm cl},x_{\\rm cl}]\\big)\\,,\\ ] ] by standard methods establishes the bh free energy . the asymptotic part of the counterterm leads to the correct asymptotic charges for bhs with ( essentially ) arbitrary asymptotic behavior , and to consistency with the first law of thermodynamics ( which is non - trivial @xcite ) .",
    "the finite part of the counterterm allows a quasi - local description of bh thermodynamics @xcite .    perhaps one might exploit the formal analogy between bh partition functions and quantum mechanical partition functions described in this work to construct interesting condensed matter analogs @xcite mimicking thermodynamical aspects of bhs",
