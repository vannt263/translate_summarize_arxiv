    "quadrupole collectivity is one of the most relevant features of nuclear structure @xcite . in this context , the theoretical understanding of the evolution of the nuclear shapes , and the structural changes associated with it , represent an active research field @xcite . from the experimental side ,",
    "low - lying spectroscopy is one of the most powerful sources of information about nuclear shapes and/or shape transitions since one can establish signatures correlating the excitation energies with the deformation properties @xcite .",
    "nowhere , however , the evolution of nuclear shapes is more documented and challenging than around the proton shell closure @xmath1 .",
    "for example , the neutron deficient lead isotopes with neutron number @xmath2 display three @xmath3 states within 1 mev excitation energy @xcite .",
    "the very rich and challenging variety of nuclear shapes also extends to the neighboring hg and po isotopes @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated @xcite that in the case of the lead isotopes the decreasing trend observed in the binding energy difference @xmath4 for decreasing mass number @xmath5 , can already be described quantitatively by mean field models in terms of deformed ground states of hg and po nuclei while the inclusion of the quadrupole correlation energy @xcite brings the calculations even closer to experiment . from the experimental point of view @xcite ,",
    "the neutron deficient mercury isotopes exhibit deformed ground states while the situation is more involved in the case of po nuclei ( see , for example @xcite , and references therein ) .    a considerable effort , has also been devoted to characterize pt nuclei @xcite . in this case , several deformation regimes have been suggested .",
    "previous theoretical investigations @xcite have found triaxial and oblate ground state shapes for the heaviest pt isotopes while for the light ones a prolate deformed regime is predicted . from the experimental point of view @xcite the energy ratio @xmath6 is almost 2.5 for pt nuclei with neutron number @xmath7 already pointing to @xmath8 soft shapes .",
    "the role played by the @xmath8 degree of freedom in pt isotopes has also been stressed by the comparison of experimental and theoretical results performed in ref .",
    "@xcite which shows , that good agreement can be obtained if triaxiality is taken into account .",
    "further down , a transition to a vibrational regime is suggested for @xmath9pt by both the experimental data and their theoretical interpretation @xcite .    the shape evolution provided by the mean field framework @xcite , based on the most recent incarnations of the gogny interaction @xcite , in the isotopic chain @xmath10pt is considered in the present study as a representative sample of nuclei close to the @xmath1 proton shell closure for which prolate , triaxial , oblate and spherical ground state shapes are found .",

    "deformed ground states were predicted in the case of pb isotopes as well as superdeformed ground states in hg isotopes at variance with experiment . in order to cure this problem , a new parametrization of the relativistic mean field lagrangian , called nlsc ,",

    "transitions from prolate to oblate shapes , as the number of neutrons increases , have been predicted in this mass region , using collective models @xcite , phenomenological woods - saxon or nilsson potentials @xcite , relativistic mean field @xcite as well as non - relativistic deformed hartree - fock ( hf ) @xcite and hfb calculations @xcite .",
    "signatures for a transition from prolate to oblate ground states , as the number of neutrons increases from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , have been found in hf , w and os isotopes .",
    "in particular , such a transition was found @xcite to happen at @xmath17 .",
    "subsequently , the evolution of the ground state shapes along the triaxial landscape of several isotopes of yb , hf , w , os and pt has been studied in ref . @xcite within the framework of the mean field approximation based on both skyrme and gogny interactions .",
    "this region is also an active research field within the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite .",
    "taking into account that around the neutron mid - shell n=104 examples of coexisting configurations have been found @xcite , it is very interesting to study the propagation of the nuclear shapes in the pt isotopic chain and the way it can be correlated with the details in the underlying single - particle levels as functions of the deformation parameters .",
    "for such a task , the mean field approximation appears as a first tool incorporating , important correlations within the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking and allowing a description of the evolution of shell structure and deformation all over the nuclear chart ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .        in the present work",
    ", our study will be performed within the selfconsistent hfb framework based on the gogny interaction @xcite .",

    "to the best of our knowledge , the results to be discussed later on in this paper , are the first systematic mean field study reported in the literature , using both d1n and d1 m parametrizations , to describe ( mean field ) ground state properties of pt nuclei .",
    "the selected isotopes @xmath10pt cover almost the whole shell ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) and display a range of ground state shapes wide enough so as to be considered a very challenging testing ground for a comparison of the ( mean field ) ground state properties predicted with the new parametrizations d1n and d1 m against the standard d1s gogny functional .",

    "we discuss our study of the triaxial landscape , providing potential energy surfaces ( pess ) , by constraining on both @xmath20 and @xmath8 quadrupole deformations . in our axial and triaxial hfb calculations we considered at the same time , the three parameter sets d1s , d1n and d1 m .",
    "the interaction gogny - d1s , taken as a reference in the present study , is already considered as a global force able to describe reasonably well low energy experimental data all over the nuclear chart ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is also likely to be the situation with the new gogny interactions d1n @xcite and d1 m @xcite but still further explorations are required .",
    "therefore , we consider all these interactions / functionals in the present study to asses to which extent the fine details of our mean field predictions for the nuclei @xmath10pt are independent of the particular version of the gogny force employed . after discussing the mean field systematics of deformation for the considered nuclei",
    ", we turn our attention , in sec .",
    "[ results - spe ] , to the underlying single - particle properties as functions of both deformation ( axial and triaxial ) and mass number .",
    "this is relevant if one keeps in mind that , from a mean field perspective , shape changes arise when the deformed single - particle levels are energetically favored to a different degree in open shell nuclei ( jahn - teller effect @xcite ) .",
    "we also consider the behaviour with neutron number of the spherical shell occupancies corresponding to the ground state of the different pt isotopes in order to shed some light into the phenomena involved in the different deformation regimes .",

    "[ conclusions ] contains the concluding remarks and work perspectives .",
    "in order to compute both pecs and pess we have used the ( constrained ) hfb method together with the parametrizations d1s , d1n and d1 m of the gogny interaction .",
    "the solution of the hfb equations , leading to the vacuum @xmath21 , was based on the so called gradient method @xcite to locate the minima .",
    "the kinetic energy of the center of mass motion has been subtracted from the routhian to be minimized in order to ensure that the center of mass is kept at rest .",
    "the exchange coulomb energy was considered in the slater approximation and we neglected the contribution of the coulomb interaction to the pairing field .",
    "the hfb quasiparticle operators have been expanded in an harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis containing enough number of shells ( i.e. , n= 13 major shells ) to grant convergence for all values of the mass quadrupole operator and for all the nuclei studied .",
    "energy contour plots will be shown in the @xmath22 plane @xcite ( instead of @xmath23 ) with    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27        other interesting pieces of information coming from the mean field are the single particle energies ( spes ) for protons and neutrons . in our calculations , with the gogny interaction , we are solving the hfb equations and therefore the only quantities that can be properly defined are the quasiparticle energies . however , in order to have the more usual , nilsson - like , diagrams we have chosen to plot the eigenvalues of the routhian @xcite @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the kinetic energy operator , @xmath30 the hartree - fock field .",
    "the term @xmath31 contains the lagrange multipliers used to enforce the corresponding constraints .",
    "we have first performed calculations restricted to axially symmetric shapes and in a second step triaxiality is included in our mean field analysis . in the first case ,",
    "obviously , the term @xmath32 is missing .",
    "in addition , the usual mean field constraints on both neutron and proton average numbers are taken into account .",
    "parity and time - reversal are selfconsistent symmetries in our axial calculations whereas parity and simplex are the ones imposed in the triaxial case @xcite .",
    "in this section , we discuss the results of the present study .",
    "the systematics of deformation obtained for the isotopes @xmath10pt is described in sec .",

    "the pecs obtained for the isotopes @xmath10pt with our constrained gogny - hfb calculations preserving axial symmetry , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_axial ] as functions of the quadrupole moment @xmath33 .",
    "both prolate ( @xmath34 ) and oblate ( @xmath35 ) sides are displayed .",
    "the prolate side is equivalent to the triaxial results , to be discussed later on , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 whereas the oblate side is equivalent to @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    as we can see , the interactions d1n and d1 m provide pecs which are extremely similar to the ones obtained with gogny - d1s .",
    "the deformations of the oblate and prolate minima are practically independent of the force . the axial quadrupole moment @xmath33 corresponding to the absolute minima of the pecs increases until @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) when it reaches the value @xmath42 b. a sudden prolate to oblate shape change occurs around @xmath43 for all the gogny interactions considered in the present study . beyond @xmath44 ,",
    "absolute oblate minima are obtained with quadrupole moments decreasing until the spherical shape is reached for @xmath45pt ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the opposite situation occurs with the secondary minima . on the other hand ,",
    "the depth of both prolate and oblate wells ( as compared to the spherical maximum ) increases with increasing @xmath47 up to @xmath48 ( roughly mid - shell ) and it decreases from there on being the decrease more pronounced for the prolate wells .",
    "this , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite can be understood first as a consequence of the filling of down slopping levels coming from the high @xmath49 , unique parity @xmath50 neutron orbital that would explain the increase of the depth and then , at mid shell , the filling of the up slopping levels that would lead to the decrease of the height of the wells .",
    "slightly lower spherical barrier heights ( i.e. , the difference between the energy of the absolute minimum of the pec and the energy of the spherical configuration ) are predicted by the new gogny forces d1n and d1 m .",
    "such a sensitivity of the spherical barriers with respect to details of the effective interactions used has already been found in previous studies @xcite . in our calculations , the largest and smallest values of the total pairing energies corresponding to the spherical configurations",
    "are obtained with the sets d1 m and d1s , respectively .",
    "the set d1n provides pairing energies in between .",
    "this already reflects the different pairing content of the considered gogny functionals but we postpone a discussion on this point for later on .        the absolute values @xmath51 of the energy differences between the prolate and oblate minima of the pecs exhibit two bumps , the first with a maximum at @xmath52 ( 2.19 , 1.97 and 2.11 mev for d1s , d1n and d1 m ) corresponds to isotopes with a prolate ground state and the second one at @xmath53 ( 1.16 , 0.95 and 0.99 mev for d1s , d1n and d1 m ) corresponds to isotopes with an oblate ground state .",
    "the nucleus @xmath54pt , separating the two regions , has almost degenerate prolate and oblate minima with @xmath51 values of 45 , 111 and 71 kev for d1s , d1n and d1 m , respectively .",
    "the previous axially symmetric results , agree well with the ones in ref .",
    "@xcite using the parametrization sly4 @xcite of the skyrme interaction in the particle - hole channel plus a zero range and density dependent pairing interaction @xcite ( with strength @xmath55 mev @xmath56 for both protons and neutrons ) and with previous skyrme - hf+bcs calculations with the parameter set siii @xcite",
    ". they also agree well with the results of the axial calculations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite using the parametrizations nl1 and nl2 of the relativistic mean field lagrangian and with axial macroscopic - microscopic calculations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , in our axial calculations , prolate and oblate minima lie quite close in energy ( @xmath57 mev ) .",
    "thus , a @xmath8-path connecting them would be possible and triaxiality could play a role , as will be discussed below , converting some of the axially symmetric minima into saddle points . therefore , in a second step , we have also explored the triaxial landscape and construct pess for all the considered nuclei .",
    "the pess obtained with the gogny sets d1s , d1n and d1 m are shown in figs .",

    "in order to simplify the presentation , the range of q values plotted is reduced to 0 b @xmath59 b and the contour lines are also severely reduced by considering contours every 250 kev up to 2 mev higher than the energy of the minimum .",
    "we can see , the spherical structure in @xmath45pt while @xmath60pt exhibit oblate ( @xmath61 ) ground states with @xmath62 3 - 4.5 b. an _ island of triaxiality _ , centered around the nucleus @xmath54pt , is clearly visible from these figures .",

    "the striking similarity of the ground state deformations obtained with the gogny interactions d1s , d1n and d1 m becomes evident from this plot .",
    "we observe the emergence of weakly oblate ground states for the isotopes @xmath60pt . on the other hand",
    ", the sudden shape transition observed in the framework of the axially symmetric hfb calculations is now replaced by a smooth shape change through the _ island of triaxiality _ represented , in our case , by the isotopes @xmath86pt .",
    "a prolate deformed regime is predicted for the isotopes @xmath87pt .",
    "we find that , the trend of shape changes predicted by our calculations in the considered pt isotopes agrees well with the ones obtained in refs . @xcite and the conclusions extracted from the combination of total routhian surface calculations plus quasiparticle random phase approximation ( trs+qrpa ) and ibm models in ref .",
    "the general trend in our calculations is also consistent with results obtained in the framework of the strutinsky approach @xcite .",
    "further down in neutron number , the trs results @xcite predict a rapid change to a triaxial shape also found in our calculations around @xmath74pt .",
    "finally , our pess for @xmath76pt exhibit features that could be interpreted as the onset of a more pronounced vibrational character for these nuclei @xcite .        the rather involved behavior of the neutron and proton pairing energies @xmath88 ( with opposite sign ) versus mass number for the pt isotopes",
    "is shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ figevolq ] .",
    "as expected for a pure @xmath46 shell closure , neutron pairing collapses for the nucleus @xmath45pt .",
    "we observe that proton pairing shows a non constant behavior in spite of having constant proton number ( @xmath89 ) that comes from selfconsistency effects . on the other hand ,",
    "neutron pairing energies are lower inside the region between @xmath90 and @xmath91 that is precisely where the strong prolate deformation develops .",
    "the lowering of pairing energies is a consequence of the lowering of the level density that is needed ( jahn - teller effect ) to induce the deformed minima .",
    "for other values of @xmath5 , the neutron level density around the fermi level is higher and , as a consequence , pairing correlations are stronger . concerning different values of the neutron and proton pairing , for the three gogny functionals the pairing energies follow the same isotopic trend and the only relevant change is in the absolute value that tends to be slightly lower for d1s .",
    "at this point it is worth to remember that the value of the pairing energy shown is related to the amount of pairing correlations present in the system but it is by far not certain that the correlation is linear , in other words , the different values of @xmath88 for different interactions do not necessarily imply the same quantitative behavior for pairing correlations .",
    "finally , the thouless - valatin moments of inertia @xmath92 of the first 2@xmath93 states in @xmath10pt are plotted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figevolq ] as functions of the mass number @xmath5 .",
    "they are compared with the experimental values extracted from the available systematics for the excitation energies of the first 2@xmath93 states in @xmath10pt ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the energies needed for the computation of @xmath94 have been obtained using the selfconsistent cranking approximation introducing the usual time reversal breaking term @xmath95 and the subsidiary condition @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "the thouless - valatin moments of inertia strongly depend on pairing and therefore a comparison of the results obtained with the three gogny functionals considered in this work , which exhibit different pairing contents , can also give a hint on the quality of their predictions . as can be seen ,",
    "the results follow the same isotopic trend irrespective of the gogny force with the tendency to be the largest for gogny - d1s and the smallest in the case of gogny - d1 m .",
    "nevertheless , the differences in the predicted values can still be attached to the uncertainties in the effective interactions and we observe how the selfconsistent cranking results tend to overestimate the experimental values .",
    "this defect , well known already , is a direct consequence of too low pairing at the mean field level and its solution would require an improved treatment of pairing correlations .",
    "there are many mechanisms beyond mean field that modify the amount of pairing correlations in a given nuclear system , but there are two particularly important that tend to increse correlations .",
    "one is the restoration of the particle number symmetry broken by the hfb method and the other is shape fluctuations around the hfb minimum .",
    "the latter is connected with the fact that the hfb minimum corresponds to a low level density region of the single particle spectrum ( see next subsection ) and therefore its amount of pairing correlations is far lower than the one of the neighbouring configurations . taking into account",
    "the first mechanism would involve particle number projection , whereas the second can only be treated in the scope of the gcm with the quadrupole moment as generating coordinate or in the bohr hamiltonian method @xcite .",
    "clearly , both methods are out of the scope of the present study .",
    "on the other hand , we observe certain correlation between the evolution with the number of neutrons of the quadrupole moments @xmath97 and the moments of inertia @xmath94 , as it is apparent by looking at the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ figevolq ] .",
    "this correlation is not so evident for the @xmath8 degree of freedom .",
    "the results discussed in this section indicate , that the new interactions / functionals d1n and d1 m provide the same quality of mean field ground state predictions for the considered pt isotopes as compared with the gogny - d1s force taken as a reference in our calculations .",
    "this coincidence give us confidence on the robustness of our mean field predictions with respect to a change in the particular parametrization of the gogny interaction used .",
    "the agreement is also rather good with the mean field picture obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite within the hf+bcs framework based on the skyrme parametrization sly4 in the particle hole channel plus a zero range and density dependent pairing ( with strength @xmath55 mev @xmath56 for both protons and neutrons ) .",
    "both gogny - d1s and skyrme - sly4 represent well reputed interactions whose reasonable predictive power has already been thoroughly tested all over the nuclear chart and it is very satisfying to observe how the new parametrizations d1n and d1 m , in spite of the relaxation of some of the original constraints in their fitting protocols and more oriented to reproducing nuclear masses @xcite , still follow very closely the fine details predicted with gogny - d1s , skyrme - sly4 and other theoretical models @xcite for an isotopic chain with such a challenging shape evolution .",
    "let us remark that we are perfectly aware of the fact that the ( static ) mean field picture described above , should also be extended to a dynamical treatment of the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "this becomes clear from the topology of the pess indicating that , in order to access a quantitative comparison of the energy spectra and reduced transition probabilities with the considered gogny interactions , the dynamical interplay between the zero point motion associated with the restoration of broken symmetries ( mainly , angular momentum and particle number ) and fluctuations in the collective parameters @xmath23 should be taken into account .",
    "for such a cumbersome and computer power demanding extension the gaussian overlap approximation ( goa ) appears as a first suitable choice @xcite . for a very recent and excellent pedagogical review ,",
    "the reader is also referred to @xcite .",
    "work along these lines is in progress and will be reported elsewhere .          in this section ,",

    "the proton @xmath102 and neutron @xmath103 fermi levels are also shown with a thick ( red ) dotted line .",
    "as it is well known , atomic nuclei `` avoid '' regions with high single particle level densities ( jahn - teller effect ) and therefore the plots of spes versus deformation help us to identify regions where energy gaps favor the appearance of deformed minima @xcite .",
    "we also look at the onset of deformation in the considered pt nuclei using the federman - pittel ( fp ) criteria @xcite .",
    "the origin of nuclear deformation is certainly a much more complicated phenomenon involving different mechanisms ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein for detailed discussions on this issue ) .",
    "even though the fp argument may be incomplete , it is certainly playing a role in the onset of nuclear deformation and we resort to it in the present mean field study as a way to establish a very qualitative and simplified overall picture of shape changes in terms of the evolution of the underlying spes . for recent studies using similar ideas ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in order to incorporate the terminology of spherical orbitals to discuss deformed configurations , we assign to a given deformed single particle orbital the label of the spherical orbit from which it originates at @xmath104 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ speq20 ] , we can see at zero deformation the spherical proton shells @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 below the fermi level @xmath102 and the @xmath109 level above it .",
    "the relative position of @xmath102 , with respect to the spes , is quite stable .",
    "the main effect of the different neutron numbers appears in the scale of fermi energies @xmath102 ranging from around -9 mev in the case of @xmath45pt to values close to zero in the case of the neutron deficient isotope @xmath110pt .",
    "therefore , in fig . [ speq20 ] we have only plotted the proton spes for the isotope @xmath98pt .",
    "the closeness to the proton magic number @xmath1 makes pt isotopes ( @xmath89 ) to display a tendency to be spherical or slightly oblate as it can be seen in fig .",

    "[ speq20 ] , the @xmath114 gets more and more occupied for increasing neutron number @xmath47 and at a certain point ( i.e. , beyond @xmath119pt ) its role is transferred to the @xmath115 and @xmath116 orbitals . according to fp only the neutron",
    "@xmath115 can interact with the proton @xmath107 ( i.e. , @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) but since the @xmath122 values are in this case low we should not expect a very strong interaction among them .",
    "this , qualitatively explains the appearance of the , very soft and close to spherical , oblate minima displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_axial ] within the mass range @xmath123 .",
    "a similar mechanism leads to very shallow and weakly prolate secondary minima in @xmath124pt .    between @xmath119pt and @xmath69pt",
    "the neutron fermi level on the prolate sector crosses a region with energy gaps of @xmath111 3 mev and between @xmath125 b and 10 b. from the neutron spe plot of @xmath54pt , we observe how within this mass range , the most prominent role is played by the @xmath114 which , according to the fp criteria , interacts optimally with the proton @xmath106 to favor a prolate shape . on the oblate side , the interaction between the relevant orbitals ,",
    "leading to the corresponding minima , takes place around @xmath126 b. the final net effect of these driving forces is the appearance of prolate and oblate minima that become saddle points inside the _ island of triaxiality _",
    "( see also the discussion below ) .",
    "below @xmath127pt , our axially symmetric calculations predict strong prolate deformations . in this case",
    "there is a strong gap on the neutron sector centered at @xmath33= 10 b , as it can be seen from the neutron spe plot of @xmath98pt .",
    "the most active deformed orbitals are the ones coming from the neutron @xmath114 and @xmath113 .",
    "they interact with the deformed proton orbitals coming from the @xmath106 and @xmath108 to produce strongly prolate deformed shapes .",
    "the secondary oblate minima predicted for these nuclei , can be associated with the proton and neutron energy gaps observed around @xmath33= -5 b. further down in neutron number , the neutron fermi level @xmath103 explores regions lower in energy resulting in less pronounced prolate minima located around @xmath33= 4 b in the neutron deficient isotopes @xmath128pt .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the origin of triaxiality and for this , proton and neutron spe plots are shown in figs .",
    "[ speaxtri - proton ] and [ speaxtri - neutron ] , respectively , as functions of the triaxial deformation parameter @xmath8 @xcite for the nucleus @xmath54pt .",
    "we consider @xmath1297.8 b which corresponds to a rather large region in the @xmath58 plane near the triaxial minimum ( located at @xmath1296.2 b , see left panel of fig.[figevolq ] ) where the pes is very flat in the two coordinates ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_d1s ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath1297.8 b also corresponds to the position of the axial prolate minimum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_axial ] ) .",
    "these plots allow us to identify the @xmath101 values of the triaxial spes at the prolate ( @xmath37 ) and oblate ( @xmath130 limits and the change of the @xmath101 contents observed in most of the levels as @xmath8 evolves .",
    "typical examples in this context , are the negative parity k=1/2 proton level with spe @xmath131 -3 mev at @xmath97=7.8 b and @xmath37 which transforms into a @xmath132 level at @xmath39 and the positive parity @xmath133 neutron level with spe @xmath131 -4.2 mev at @xmath97=7.8 b and @xmath37 which transforms into a @xmath134 level at @xmath39 .",
    "the rather low level density below the proton fermi level for @xmath8 between @xmath135 and @xmath136 favors the flateness of the energy curve as a function of @xmath8 helping thereby the development of the triaxial minimum in @xmath54pt around @xmath137 . from this plot",
    "we also conclude that the isotopes with two protons less ( os isotopes ) will be more prone to triaxiallity as discussed in ref @xcite . concerning the behaviour of the neutron",
    "spes with @xmath8 depicted on fig .",
    "[ speaxtri - neutron ] we observe a region of low level density in the interval of @xmath8 between @xmath135 and @xmath138 that would favor the development of triaxiallity . from there on the level density increases and therefore , in order to develop a triaxial minimum , the system is forced to change its @xmath97 deformation to lower values ( see fig . [ fig_d1s ] for the nucleus under consideration , @xmath54pt ) .",
    "the removal of two or four neutrons makes the level density in the range of @xmath8 between @xmath135 and @xmath138 even lower than in the case of @xmath54pt explaining the @xmath8 deformed minima observed in fig .",
    "[ evol - min - gamma ] for the nuclei @xmath139pt . on the other hand",

    "[ evol - min - gamma ] .    in the spirit of the shell model ,",
    "it is also interesting to compute the spherical occupancies @xmath144 of the different @xmath145 orbitals in the ( usually ) deformed ground states @xmath146 of the pt isotopes studied in this paper .",
    "they are given by    @xmath147    where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the creation and annihilation operators of spherical harmonic oscillator orbits characterized by the quantum numbers @xmath150 , @xmath122 , @xmath49 , @xmath151 .",
    "the sum in @xmath151 is introduced to make the quantity ( [ eq - occup ] ) invariant under changes in orientation ( and therefore to represent a genuine `` spherical '' quantity ) .",
    "the sum in the radial quantum number @xmath150 does not allow to pin down which specific ho orbital is occupied but , on the other hand , allows us to get rid of the uncertainties associated to the fact that the radial wave function of the nuclear orbitals is close but not exactly the one of the ho .",
    "the proton spherical occupancies in the ground state wave functions of all the pt isotopes considered are shown on the left panel of fig . [ occupations ] .",
    "as the number of protons remains constant along the isotopic chain one could expect a flat behavior of all the occupancies .",
    "however , we observe in that figure how the occupancies of the different orbitals can be classified in two different regimes , namely the weak deformation regime including @xmath152pt and @xmath153pt and the strong deformation regime including the nuclei @xmath154pt .",
    "it is noteworthy that in each of the regimes the proton occupancies remain rather constant irrespective of the @xmath8 deformation and even the specific value of the @xmath97 deformation parameter .",
    "the strong deformation regime differs from the weak deformation one in that the @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 orbitals loose occupancy in favor of the @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "this rearrangement of the occupancies is mainly due to the smearing out of the fermi surface as a consequence of the increasing proton pairing correlations ( see fig .",
    "[ figevolq ] ) and to a lesser extent to the quadrupole interaction among orbits that can transfer particles from one orbit to another .",
    "given the shift of occupancies from the @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 to the @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 orbitals we can interpret the well deformed ground state of @xmath154pt as a multiparticle - multihole excitation out of a reference spherical ground state .",
    "the number of particles exchanged in this kind of spherical shell model language is in between two to four according to the results shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ occupations ] .    in the case of neutrons , shown on the right panel of fig . [ occupations ] , as neutron number increases we are occupying orbitals belonging to the @xmath161 negative parity major shell and the positive parity intruder @xmath50 . as a consequence of deformation ,",
    "the spherical orbitals are mixed up and therefore placing two particles in a given deformed orbital by no means implies placing two particles in an spherical orbit .",
    "the two particles will be distributed among all the components of the deformed orbital when expressed in the spherical basis . as a consequence ,",
    "the behavior of the spherical occupancies with neutron number is more or less linear in the whole interval and for all the orbitals involved .",
    "the only noticeable deviation from this trend takes place when entering the strong deformation regime where the @xmath158 , @xmath160 and @xmath157 orbitals loose particles in favor of the high @xmath49 orbitals @xmath50 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "also the @xmath165 orbital gets more particles ( through the coupling to the @xmath166 orbital ) .",
    "this change in occupancies can be mostly attributed to the quenching of neutron pairing correlations in the ground state of the strongly deformed isotopes @xmath154pt . when the weak deformation regime is entered at @xmath43 a much smoother behavior of the spherical occupancies",
    "is recovered .",
    "this , together with the smooth behavior of proton occupancies is quite unexpected as in the weak deformation regime the different isotopes have a variety of ground state deformations ranging from prolate to triaxial to oblate .",
    "the conclusion is that the occupancies are more sensitive to the magnitude of the deformation @xmath97 than to the @xmath8 degree of freedom .",
    "the proton levels closest to the fermi level are the @xmath167 , @xmath157 , @xmath156 and @xmath155 and therefore are the ones expected to strongly interact with the neutron spin orbit partner according to the fp mechanism .",
    "the more effective orbitals are those with high @xmath49 and therefore the proton @xmath157 is expected to strongly interact with neutrons @xmath160 which is empty at the beginning of the chain and gets steadily occupied as more neutrons are added .",
    "also a strong interaction is expected with the neutron @xmath50 orbital that shares with the @xmath160 one the occupation pattern as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "it is also noteworthy to point out how proton @xmath160 , that should be empty according to the spherical shell model , gets some occupancy for the well deformed nuclei @xmath154pt as a consequence of the smearing out of the fermi surface , that allows those orbitals to interact via fp with the neutrons @xmath157 and @xmath165 .",
    "it could be argued that the proton @xmath157 orbital is loosing two particles in the strong deformation regime and this could imply a strong impact in its interaction with its neutron spin - orbit partner .",
    "this would be true if the @xmath157 orbital were occupied by a small amount of neutrons ( of the order of two ) as this would imply completely emptying out the orbtial , but it has to be bear in mind that there are ten neutrons at the begining of the region under consideration .",
    "in this paper we have studied the evolution of the ground state nuclear shapes in a series of pt isotopes ranging from @xmath168 up to @xmath169 , covering practically one complete major shell .",
    "the study has been performed within the selfconsistent hfb approach based on the d1s @xcite and the recent d1n @xcite and d1 m @xcite parametrizations of the gogny interaction and we have included , in addition to the axially symmetric limit , the triaxial degrees of freedom @xmath20 and @xmath8 .    from the analysis of the axially symmetric limit , we conclude that a sudden prolate to oblate shape change occurs around @xmath170 for all the gogny parametrizations considered .",
    "this result is also in agreement with those obtained either with skyrme forces or from relativistic mean field calculations @xcite . on the other hand , when triaxiality is taken into account ,",
    "the picture that finally emerges is that of smooth transitions between the different shape regimes .",
    "we find that the absolute minimum of the pess for the pt isotopes evolves from prolate shapes with increasing values of their quadrupole moments @xmath97 in the lighter isotopes @xmath171 ( with the exception of @xmath172 , which exhibit a tendency to triaxiality ) , to triaxial @xmath8-soft in the intermediate isotopes with @xmath173 , and to oblate shapes in the most neutron - rich isotopes @xmath174 .",
    "finally , the isotope @xmath45pt becomes spherical . by analyzing pecs and the @xmath58 landscapes",
    ", we observe that the ( axial ) prolate and oblate minima , well separated by high energy barriers in the @xmath20 degree of freedom , are softly linked along the @xmath8 direction . indeed , most of the secondary axial minima become saddle points when the @xmath8 degree of freedom is included in the analysis .",
    "pairing energies and thouless - valatin moments of inertia have also been analyzed as functions of the number of neutrons , finding some correlation with the evolution of the quadrupole deformation @xmath97 .",
    "such a correlation , on the other hand , is not so evident in the case of the @xmath8 angle .",
    "we consider the similarity between the mean field ground state properties predicted for the considered pt chain with the most recent versions of the gogny interaction ( i.e. , d1s , d1n and d1 m ) employed in the present study as very positive . on one hand ,",
    "the results give us confidence concerning the robustness of the predictions against the details of the particular effective gogny interaction used .",
    "the robustness is reinforced when the trend of our calculations is compared with the ones obtained with skyrme forces @xcite and other theoretical approaches @xcite , which are again very similar .",
    "on the other hand , our results also point to the fact that the new incarnations d1n and d1 m of the gogny interaction , based on fitting protocols more in the direction of astrophysical applications @xcite , essentially keep the predictive power of the gogny - d1s force @xcite already considered as a ( standard ) global force .",
    "we have analyzed the proton and neutron spes as functions of both axial and triaxial deformation parameters in some illustrative examples .",
    "the analysis has been done in terms of the density of levels around the fermi surface ( jahn - teller effect @xcite ) and the federman - pittel mechanism @xcite .",
    "our discussion has also been illustrated with the calculation of the spherical occupancies in the ground state wave functions of the considered pt nuclei . as a result",
    ", we obtain a qualitative understanding of the emergence of deformed configurations with two main ingredients which are , the energy gaps that appear at different deformations in the spes of neutrons when the fermi level @xmath103 crosses different regions , and the special role of the overlap between the proton @xmath175 and the neutron @xmath176 orbitals .",
    "the study of the low - lying excitation spectra and transition rates in conjunction with shape transitions , would require to extend the present mean field approach to take into account correlations related to restoration of broken symmetries and fluctuations of collective variables .",
    "the restoration of broken symmetries would imply , among others , triaxial projections to restore rotational symmetry and this is a very difficult and delicated issue with realistic forces @xcite .",
    "these difficulties lead to consider instead of the exact projection some kind of approximation to it that could eventually end up in a kind of collective bohr hamiltonian @xcite with deformation dependent parameters . upon completion of this work",
    ", a preprint has appeared @xcite dealing with the calculation of @xmath177 excitation energies in the framework of the 5-d bohr hamiltonian method with parameters extracted from a microscopic mean field calculation with the gogny d1s force . as a consequence of the number of nuclei considered ( around two thousand ) in that calculation ,",
    "their analysis of the mean field results is not as exahustive as ours .",

    "<S> the evolution of the nuclear shapes along the triaxial landscape is studied in the pt isotopic chain using the selfconsistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation based on the gogny interaction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the parametrization d1s , the new incarnations d1n and d1 m of this force are also included in our analysis to asses to which extent the predictions are independent of details of the effective interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the considered range of neutron numbers @xmath0 includes prolate , triaxial , oblate and spherical ground state shapes and serves for a detailed comparison of the predictions obtained with the new sets d1n and d1 m against the ones provided by the standard parametrization gogny - d1s in a region of the nuclear landscape for which experimental and theoretical fingerprints of shape transitions have been found . </S>",
    "<S> structural evolution along the pt chain is discussed in terms of the deformation dependence of single particle energies . </S>"
