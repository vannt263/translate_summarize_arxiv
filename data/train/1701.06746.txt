    "polymer electrolyte membrane ( pem ) fuel cell has shown promising potential in the ongoing quest for reliable alternate energy sources",
    ". the main component of such a fuel cell is a polymer membrane separating the anode and cathode , which allows only protons to pass through it , while blocking the fuel from crossing over .",
    "sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone ) , speek , is an emerging alternative to the widely used nafion @xcite as a material for pem .",
    "speek - based pem has been reported to possess high thermal stability @xcite and proton conductivity comparable to that based on nafion @xcite , along with narrower and less connected hydrophilic channels that can be useful in reducing fuel cross - over @xcite . at sufficiently hydrated state ,",
    "these sulfonated polymer membranes attain a phase separated morphology , which gives rise to connected network of water channels for proton conduction @xcite .",
    "while the origin and morphology of the water channels in the sulfonated polymer membranes still remain under investigation , scattering experiments have predicted them to be of the order of few nano - meters ( nm ) in diameter @xcite .",
    "simulations aiming to probe the membrane at such large length scales usually rely on mesoscale particle - based methods such as dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) or mean - field theory - based dynamic density functional theory ( ddft ) .",
    "such studies have been extensively used to understand the morphology of nafion @xcite and speek @xcite membranes .",
    "these simulations were quite successful in providing the mesoscale morphology of the sulfonated membrane , in terms of the phase separation and its evolution with increasing water content .",
    "however , the structural changes happening at the molecular scale , which is the key reason for the phase separated morphology , can not be captured by these simulations , owing to their intrinsic length scales that are relatively larger .",
    "on the other hand , atomistic simulations are helpful in the study of the dynamics of water and counter - ion and in understanding the membrane morphology at the level of individual sulfonate groups , counter - ions , and water molecules @xcite .",
    "such studies can also be used to understand the effect of hydration , temperature , and degree of sulfonation on the static and dynamical properties of the hydrated membranes . however , computational cost limits these simulations to small system sizes . in an atomistic simulation on nafion and hyflon using a simulation box size of @xmath1 7.5 nm , karo et al .",
    "@xcite reported the dependency of water channel topology and connectivity on the simulated system size , by comparing them against those obtained in their earlier work with a smaller system size ( nearly half of the larger box size ) @xcite .",
    "though achieving larger length scales in atomistic simulation is nonetheless possible , it is computationally expensive and calls for sophisticated modeling approach and computing resource @xcite . in the work presented here",
    ", we use a systematic coarse - graining method developed by us @xcite to access the atomistic configurations with large system sizes .    in accordance with the scattering experiments",
    "@xcite , simulations on sulfonated membranes have reported the presence of small water domains at low hydration level @xmath0 , the number of water molecules per sulfonate group .",
    "these domains are believed to grow with increasing @xmath0 and eventually get connected to form a percolating network of water channels at @xmath2 .",
    "devanathan et al .",
    "have used atomistic simulation to characterize water percolation in nafion and phenylated speekk membranes . for fully sulfonated nafion",
    ", they have reported a @xmath2 value between @xmath0 = 5 and 6 @xcite for 100% sulfonated chains with total 40 so@xmath3 units at 300 k. for fully sulfonated phenylated speekk in presence of 1.33 m methanol with 180 so@xmath3 units at 360 k , they reported a @xmath2 value of 7.92 @xcite .",
    "system size , degree of sulfonation and dissociation , temperature , and presence of co - solvent such as methanol , are all factors which can affect the percolation transition in the membrane . using density functional theory , komarov et al .",
    "@xcite have reported a @xmath2 value close to 9 for speek membrane with 50% sulfonation at 300 k. though there exist several atomistic simulation studies on the effect of hydration , to the best of our knowledge , there has been no such systematic studies on water percolation in speek .",
    "brunello et al .",
    "@xcite used atomistic simulations , on a 40% sulfnated speek system with 80 so@xmath3 units at 353.15 k , to study the hydration effect in terms of radial distribution functions ( rdfs ) , coordination numbers , and hydronium diffusivity .",
    "mahajan and ganesan @xcite also studied the effect of methanol , using a 50% sulfonated speek system with 92 so@xmath3 units in presence of 1 m methanol at 338 k. a comparison between the different studies is very important for a better characterization and understanding of the effect of hydration on the membrane morphology .",
    "the present study intends to systematically characterize the extent of phase separation and percolation in speek membrane , with increasing water content . at the level of individual sulfonate group , water molecule , and hydronium ion , the evolution in their local arrangement",
    "is studied in terms of various rdfs and the minimum pair distances .",
    "the transport properties of water molecule and hydronium ion are studied in terms of their mean - squared displacements ( msds ) and diffusion coefficients .",
    "detailed cluster analysis is performed to characterize the collective water phase in the membrane .",
    "the variations in these properties with increasing hydration is analyzed to characterize the morphological evolution .",
    "our main results are the following .",
    "the water molecules are found to strongly interact with the sulfonate groups in the speek membrane , in agreement with experimental prediction .",
    "the hydronium ions exhibit a comparatively weaker interaction with the sulfonate groups , as opposed to that in nafion .",
    "the water phase , though grows with increasing hydration , remains distinct from bulk phase , as indicated by the diffusion coefficient .",
    "a percolation transition is identified in the speek membrane between @xmath0 = 8 and 10 , which leads to enhanced mobility of hydronium ion .",
    "however , small water domains remain isolated in speek membrane even at a large water content , as opposed to that in nafion , demonstrating the extent of phase separation to be lesser in the former than nafion .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the details of the atomistic simulation . in section 3 , we discuss the results obtained from analyses on speek membrane at various water contents .",
    "we conclude in section 4 with a short summary and probable future directions .",
    "in our earlier work on systematic coarse - graining of speek @xcite , we developed a model , with the highest possible coarse - grained ( cg ) mapping , for a 50% sulfonated speek with alternate sulfonated units ( figure  [ fgr : structure ] ) .",
    "our cg model coarse - grains the atomistic repeat unit shown in figure  [ fgr : structure ] , consisting of 71 atoms , into 3 cg beads , a , b , and c , as shown in the inset of figure  [ fgr : cg_map_pot_nb](a ) .",
    "the corresponding cg potentials were optimized using iterative boltzmann inversion @xcite method .",
    "the optimized non - bonded ( nb ) potentials between various cg bead pairs are shown in figure  [ fgr : cg_map_pot_nb ] .",
    "these potentials along with bond , angle , and dihedral potentials , constitute the full set of numerical potential for the speek system under consideration . though obtained from base atomistic simulation of short single chain ,",
    "the cg potentials were shown to be scalable to larger systems , both for single chains of longer length as well as for multiple chains , at the same environmental conditions .",
    "along with accelerated equilibration of comparatively larger cg systems , cg simulation can reproduce the target distributions collected from the atomistic simulation . the corresponding equilibrated atomistic trajectory",
    "was easily obtained upon back - mapping , wherein a pre - equilibrated atomistic chain is mapped onto an equilibrated cg configuration of a comparatively larger system size , followed by short molecular dynamics ( md ) run .",
    "further details on the coarse - graining methodology , cg potentials , and back - mapping can be obtained in the original reference @xcite .    using the above mentioned protocol , we back - mapped equilibrated cg structure consisting of 8 speek chains , each with 30 peek - speek repeat units ( 50% degree of sulfonation ) .",
    "240 hydronium ions were randomly introduced in the identified voids for charge neutrality , along with 2400 water molecules , at hydration level @xmath0 = 10 ( the number of water molecules per sulfonate group ) , resulting in the initial configuration for further atomistic simulation .",
    "this method can thus be useful in generating near - equilibrium atomistic configuration of larger system size , without the need of amorphous builder tools , which are generally used in such simulation studies @xcite .",
    "the interaction parameters for the polymer were taken from dreiding force field @xcite . for water molecules ,",
    "the modified tip3p model @xcite was used , while the force field from jang et al .",
    "@xcite was adopted for hydronium ions .",
    "md simulation was performed using lammps ( large - scale atomic / molecular massively parallel simulator ) package @xcite and a verlet type integrator with integration time step of 1 femto - second ( fs ) .",
    "the state point was fixed at 400 k temperature and 1 atm pressure using nos - hoover thermostat and barostat , with time constants of 0.1 pico - second ( ps ) and 1 ps , respectively . to relax the stretched / compressed bonds and overlapping polymer segments , and to accelerate equilibration , repeated thermal annealing cycles were performed .",
    "the simulation run lasted for 11.2 nano - seconds ( ns ) with snapshots of trajectory collected at every 10 ps .",
    "stable energy and volume trajectories were recorded after 5 ns run , and the equilibrium density was calculated to be 1.203 gm @xmath4 .",
    "the cg potentials for speek system were originally extracted using a single chain atomistic system at @xmath0 = 4.067 @xcite .",
    "however , we show that the back - mapped structure can be used as the starting configuration for ( larger ) atomistic simulations at other hydration levels as well . as a test case , we performed 20 statistically independent atomistic simulations on single chain speek systems , with 30 hydronium ions at @xmath0 = 10 .",
    "the average equilibrium density and rdfs , between the sulfur atoms , water molecules , and hydronium ions , were computed for both the multi - chain and single chain systems for comparison .",
    "the density was found to be 1.168 @xmath5 0.006",
    "gm @xmath4 , close to that from the multi - chain counter - part . the overall agreement , between the multi - chain rdfs and the averaged ( over 20 systems ) single chain ones , was found to be quite good ( data not shown ) , even though the comparison was against a set of averaged distributions calculated from statistically independent systems .",
    "this suggests a general scheme for simulating comparatively larger atomistic systems possessing well - mixed polymer configuration , starting from an equilibrated cg structure .",
    "also , such a scheme does not call for much complicated equilibration techniques or long simulation runs .    to understand the morphological changes happening in the speek membrane due to variation in water content , we simulated multi - chain atomistic systems of speek at hydration levels @xmath0 = 4.067(@xmath14 ) , 7 , 8 , 9 , 12 , and 15 , at 400 k temperature and 1 atm pressure , using the above mentioned methodology .",
    "the above temperature was chosen as speek has been considered as an alternative to nafion , especially for high temperature performance @xcite .",
    "while excellent ionic conductivity for speek membranes at 393 k has been reported in experiment @xcite , the previous simulation studies on speek have investigated the membrane properties only up to 353 k @xcite .",
    "we chose to simulate hydrated speek membranes at an elevated temperature , of 400 k , as such an elevated temperature also quickens the equilibration in atomistic simulation .",
    "the equilibrium box sizes , density values , and other important details of the simulation are summarized in table  [ tbl : multi_chain_speek_aa ] .",
    "the equilibrium volume of the simulation box was found to monotonously increase with increasing hydration .",
    "the density , however , showed an initial increase followed by steady decrease , possibly due to a combination of molecular re - organization and swelling in the membrane @xcite .",
    "experiments suggest the density of dry peek to be in the range of 1.26 - 1.32 gm @xmath4 @xcite and the density is known to decrease upon sulfonation @xcite and hydration @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium density values , reported here , are therefore well within the expected range for hydrated speek .",
    "brunello et al .",
    "@xcite have reported speek membrane densities at 353.15 k , ranging from 1.07 gm @xmath4 at @xmath0 = 4.9 to 1.18 gm @xmath4 for @xmath0 = 11.1 .",
    "speek membrane densities , in presence of 1 m methanol at 338 k , has been reported by mahajan and ganesan @xcite to range between 1.1318 gm @xmath4 at @xmath0 = 1.94 to 0.8587 gm @xmath4 at @xmath0 = 25.05 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     snapshots of the simulation boxes containing the largest clusters for hydration levels 4.067 , 10 , and 15 ( as given in table  [ tbl : max_cluster_size ] ) are shown in figure  [ fgr : max_cluster_snapshot ] .",
    "the largest cluster at @xmath0 @xmath1 4 is found to occupy a small fraction of the simulation box volume and forms a narrow connected path of water molecules and hydronium ions .",
    "a well connected network , spanning the entire simulation box , is observed at @xmath0 = 10 , with the appearance of larger water domains .",
    "these domains further grow in size , leading to the formation of the nano - meter - size water domains ( or channels ) , that have been observed in scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "such a large water domain is observed to span more than half of the simulation box length ( @xmath6 3 nm ) at @xmath0 = 15 .      to get further insight into the water phase in speek membrane , we calculated the cluster size distribution for all the hydration levels under study",
    ". figure  [ fgr : cluster_distribution](a ) , shows the variation in n@xmath7 , the occurrence probability ( number of clusters with size s ) , with hydration .",
    "isolated water molecules or hydronium ions were considered as clusters of size s = 1 .",
    "the distribution was found to span over two orders of magnitude in s at @xmath0 @xmath1 4 to more than three orders at @xmath0 = 15 .",
    "the two separate regimes in n@xmath7 , comprising of continuously varying cluster sizes at lower s and isolated large clusters at higher s , became more distinct as @xmath0 increased beyond 7 , suggesting the onset of spanning clusters at @xmath0 = 7 . in three dimensions , at the onset of random percolation , n@xmath7 is known to obey a power law @xcite : n@xmath7 @xmath1 s@xmath8 .",
    "this behavior over the lower range of s is shown in figure  [ fgr : cluster_distribution](b ) , where the expected power law is shown with a line as guide to the eye .",
    "the occurrence probability , n@xmath7 is multiplied by the corresponding @xmath0 for better comparison .",
    "it should be noted that the threshold to percolation is known to be system size dependent @xcite .",
    "additionally , the uncertainty in the onset of percolation is larger when the system size is smaller @xcite . in our simulations , the largest extent of power law",
    "was obtained at @xmath0 = 8 , with the entire small s range represented by a power law exponent of 2.25 , as shown in the inset of figure  [ fgr : cluster_distribution](b ) .",
    "based on the agreement with the power law and the similarity of the exponent with that for random percolation , we consider @xmath0 = 8 to be closest to percolation threshold in speek membranes for the system sizes considered here . in a similar analysis for nafion @xcite , the authors reported @xmath0 = 5 to be closest to percolation threshold as the widest range of distribution data ( s = 2 to 199 ) could be fit to a power law with an exponent of 1.6 .",
    "we also calculated the mean cluster size s@xmath9 where the sum is over all clusters excluding second mode in the distribution ( plotted in figure  [ fgr : mean_cluster_size ] ) .",
    "s@xmath10 is known to exhibit a maximum just below percolation in finite size systems @xcite .",
    "the maximum at @xmath0 = 7 suggests percolation to occur after this hydration , which is in agreement with the analysis of the cluster size distribution .",
    "figure  [ fgr : system_snapshot ] shows the atomistic snapshots of the speek membrane at @xmath0 : 4.067 , 10 , and 15 .",
    "small isolated water clusters present at @xmath0 @xmath1 4 can be seen to grow and get eventually connected at @xmath0 = 10 . beyond this hydration ,",
    "the water cluster grow to form larger domains .",
    "large water domains connected by narrower networks of water are clearly visible at @xmath0 = 15 .",
    "the sulfur atoms scattered in the polymer matrix at low @xmath0 , lie at the boundary of the water phase at higher @xmath0 , while the hydronium ions are observed to be in the continuous water phase . in line with our analysis",
    ", @xmath0 = 10 seems to be beyond percolation with a well connected water phase .",
    "@xmath0 = 15 clearly has well - developed water network and well - defined water domains .",
    "however , the presence of isolated clusters can be observed even at @xmath0 = 15 .",
    "our simulation results indicate random percolation transition , in the speek membrane under study , to occur between @xmath0 = 8 and 10 .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier investigation on speek using density functional theory by komarov et al .",
    "@xcite , who reported a percolation threshold hydration level of @xmath1 9 .",
    "a value of 7.92 was reported as percolation threshold in phenylated speekk by devanathan et al .",
    "this work has focused on the effect of hydration on the structural and dynamical properties of speek membranes .",
    "we systematically investigate the effect of increasing water content : from the level of individual molecules , in terms of their local structuring and transport , to collective properties , in terms of the growing water phase in the membrane .",
    "a combination of coarse - graining and back - mapping methodology is used to access the relevant length scales in atomistic simulation .    at low hydration ,",
    "small isolated water clusters are present in the membrane and hydronium ions stay bound to the nearby sulfonate groups . as hydration increases ,",
    "water molecules solvate the sulfonate group , thereby detaching the hydronium ions from the sulfonate groups and pushing them into the growing water phase .",
    "water molecules are found to be more strongly bound to the sulfonate groups in speek than in nafion , as previously suggested by experiments @xcite . with increasing hydration ,",
    "the isolated clusters merge to form larger connected network .",
    "however , unlike nafion , where all available water molecules and hydronium ions in the system form a spanning cluster at @xmath0 as low as 5 @xcite , small clusters can remain isolated in speek even at @xmath0 = 15 .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier experimental observations suggesting the extent of phase separation in speek to be lesser than that in nafion @xcite .",
    "the mobility of water molecules remains much less than that of bulk water , even at the highest water content , demonstrating the bound nature of water in speek membranes , in agreement with earlier experimental findings @xcite .",
    "further analyses suggest a percolation transition occurring in the speek membrane between @xmath0 = 8 and 10 , where the mobility of hydronium ion suddenly increases .",
    "this sudden jump in the diffusion coefficient can be attributed to the well connected water network forming beyond percolation , which promotes the hydronium diffusion through the membrane .    on the methodology front",
    ", we show that equilibrated structure from multi - chain cg simulation , with well - mixed near - equilibrium polymer configuration , can be used as a starting point for further atomistic simulations on hydrated speek .",
    "this method leads to faster equilibration of the atomistic system , without compromising the equilibrium structural properties .",
    "environmental condition such as hydration and temperature can be varied at this point to study their effect on the static and dynamic properties of the system .",
    "such a protocol can accelerate the equilibration of large - scale atomistic polymer system without the need of sophisticated computational technique or resource .",
