    "the hamiltonian describing the optomechanical coupling @xcite can be written and linearized in the form : @xmath108 where @xmath109 denotes the mechanical oscillator s position fluctuation around its mean distance to the toroid @xmath26 , @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) are creation ( annihilation ) operators of the optical mode with position dependent resonance frequency @xmath112 , and the optomechanical coupling rate @xmath113 is given by : @xmath114 the linearization is justified when considering the typical amplitudes of the nanomechanical oscillators brownian noise of tens of pm at room temperature which is much smaller than the decay length of the evanescent field of typically 200 nm . the optical force exerted on the mechanical oscillator by the intracavity field ( power @xmath115 ) can be written as @xmath116}{i\\hbar}=-\\hbar g\\hat { a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}=-\\hbar g\\frac{p}{\\hbar\\omega_\\mathrm{0}}\\tau_{\\mathrm{rt}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath117 denotes the cavity roundtrip time . for a toroid of radius @xmath118 and with effective refractive index @xmath119 averaged over the mode profile that entails an evanescent part @xmath120 sampling the refractive index of the surrounding medium , @xmath121 , and the refractive index of silica , @xmath122 , it is given by @xmath123 ( @xmath124 : speed of light ) .",
    "note that the force per photon ( @xmath125 ) is determined solely by the coupling rate @xmath51 . for comparison , if one studies the coupling to the intrinsic radial breathing mode of the toroid @xcite , then @xmath126 and the force takes the usual form : @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the intracavity effective wave vector .",

    "when the nanomechanical oscillator in form of a doubly clamped sin string is placed horizontally ( i.e. parallel to the propagation of the wgm)as in the experiments presented in the main manuscript , one needs to take into account the finite sampling length due to the toroid s curvature . when the nanostring is positioned tangentially to the toroid at a distance @xmath26 from the rim , the field at a volume element at position @xmath148 from the center of the nanostring can be expressed as @xmath149 .",
    "this expression yields a mean transverse sampling length of @xmath150 ( with correction terms @xmath151 ) .",
    "the effective area of the nanomechanical oscillator seen by the light field is then approximately given by @xmath152 ( @xmath153 : nanomechanical oscillator s width ) .",

    "this yields the following expression for the coupling rate : @xmath167 the ratio between the optomechanical coupling rates obtained in the horizontal and vertical configurations is @xmath168 for the typical values specified above and a minor radius of @xmath169 , this expression evaluates to @xmath170 which is in agreement with the experimental observation , that slightly higher coupling rates can be achieved in the horizontal configuration .      for a nanomechanical sheet , the effective area sampled by the cavity",
    "is given by @xmath171 which for the parameters mentioned above and a sheet thickness of @xmath172 yields a coupling rate of @xmath173 which is only a factor of two from the values obtained experimentally .",

    "the fundamental mode pattern of the strings extending from @xmath180 to @xmath181 can be described as @xmath182 and fulfills the equipartition theorem in the following sense : @xmath183 where @xmath184 denotes the oscillator s physical mass and @xmath185 is the mean squared displacement amplitude averaged along the string s length ( note that for the time and space averaged root mean square amplitude @xmath186 one would obtain @xmath187 ) . in general , however , the measured effective coordinate deviates from @xmath188 since it is weighted by the geometry of the measurement apparatus which in our case is given by the spatial distribution of the normalized optical mode profile @xmath189 sampling the nanomechanical string ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "this yields an effective measured squared displacement of @xmath191 .",
    "thus , the oscillator s mass correspondingly has to be adjusted in order to maintain equipartition for the actually measured coordinate , leading to an individual effective mass @xmath192 for each mechanical mode .",
    "the effective mass of the @xmath122-th mode ( with mode pattern @xmath193 ) can then generally be written as @xmath194 assuming for example a point like measurement , i.e. @xmath195 , the effective mass of the eigenmodes which are symmetric around @xmath196 evaluates to @xmath197 .",
    "note that the effective mass of all antisymmetric modes in contrast diverges for any symmetric probing around @xmath196 .",
    "this is in fact used in practice for optimizing the centering of the nanomechanical strings . + inserting the approximate expression of the toroid field obtained in the previous section @xmath198 ( for the horizontral configuration as used in the experiments presented in the main manuscript ) as well as the fundamental mode pattern of the strings into eqn .",

    "the dynamically determined optomechanical coupling rates ( @xmath205 ) , however , are not , since the transduction of the individual mechanical modes motion to cavity frequency noise involves the mode pattern of the particular mechanical modes .",
    "thus , the overlap between optical and mechanical modes has to be accounted for in order to recover correct displacement amplitudes . for a point like measurement of e.g. the fundamental mode at the center of the string",
    ", the measured coordinate is given by the the peak displacement @xmath206 which is @xmath207 larger than the root mean squared displacement @xmath208 averaged along the full length of the string .",
    "thus , the measured mechanical oscillator mode effectively can be described by a @xmath209 smaller mass , i.e. its effective mass @xmath210 as mentioned above .",
    "+ all our measurements are in fact close to such a point like measurement , i.e. @xmath211 is sufficiently small such that the second fraction in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : meff2 ] ) evaluates to values close to unity yielding effective masses @xmath212 .",
    "the deviations from the point - like value @xmath210 ( largest for the shortest strings of @xmath213 where a deviation of 30% is found ) are , however , accounted for . thus employing the correct efffective mass for the single - sided brownian noise",
