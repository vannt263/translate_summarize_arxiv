    "in a heavy fermion ( hf ) kondo lattice system , the ground state is a fermi - liquid ( fl ) state constituting the landau quasi - particles . in ce- , yb- , and u - based intermetallic systems the conduction electrons compensate or screen the localized moments of the @xmath8-electrons where localized electrons together with their screening cloud form quasi - particles .",
