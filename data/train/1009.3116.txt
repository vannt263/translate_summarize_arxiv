    "everyone knows the gaussian distribution function . whenever we are dealing with a system containing _ independent _ random parameters , its macroscopic characteristics ( according to the central limit theorem )",
    "are described by the gaussian distribution .",
    "this kind of universal behavior is trivial , and not so much interesting . on the other hand ,",
    "every non - trivial system usually requires individual consideration , and although there are lot of universal macroscopic properties among microscopically different systems ( e.g. scaling and critical phenomena at the phase transitions ) until very recently no one would expect to have a _ universal function _ ( different from the gaussian one ) which would describe macroscopic statistical properties of a whole class of non - trivial random systems .",
    "originally the solution of tracy and widom @xcite were devoted to rather specific mathematical problem , namely the distribution function of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath0 hermitian matrices ( gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) ) in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "nowadays we have got rather comprehensive list of various systems ( both purely mathematical and physical ) whose macroscopic statistical properties are described by the same universal tracy - widom ( tw ) distribution function .",
    "these systems are : the longest increasing subsequences ( lis ) model @xcite ( section i.a ) zero - temperature lattice directed polymers with geometric disorder @xcite the polynuclear growth ( png ) system @xcite , ( section i.b ) the oriented digital boiling model @xcite , the ballistic decomposition model @xcite , the longest common subsequences ( lcs ) @xcite , the one - point distribution of the solutions of the kpz equation @xcite ( which describes the motion of an interface separating two homogeneous bulk phases ) in the long time limit @xcite , and finally finite temperature directed polymers in random potentials with short - range correlations @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that directed polymers in a quenched random potential have been the subject of intense investigations during the past three decades ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "diverse physical systems such as domain walls in magnetic films @xcite , vortices in superconductors @xcite , wetting fronts on planar systems @xcite , or burgers turbulence @xcite can be mapped to this model , which exhibits numerous non - trivial features deriving from the interplay between elasticity and disorder .    the rest of this introduction is devoted to the discussion of several random statistical systems with explanations in very simple terms of what the tw distribution describes in them .",
    "namely , we will consider the combinatorial model of the longest increasing subsequences ( section i.a ) , the polynuclear crystal growth model ( section i.b ) , and one - dimensional directed polymers in random potential ( section i.c ) .",
    "besides in section i.d the main ides of the replica method ( used in the present approach ) will be described , and finally in section i.e the definition and the main properties of the tw distribution function will be given .",
    "sections ii and iii are devoted to the exact solution of the one - dimensional directed polymers problem .",
    "in particular , in section ii the main ideas of this solution as well as its methodological tools are described .",
    "section iii contains the main lines of the derivation of the tw distribution function for the free energy fluctuations in one - dimensional directed polymers with @xmath2-correlated random potential .",
    "the second part of this review contains several technical appendices containing all necessary mathematical tools ( used in the previous sections ) which hopefully makes the whole paper to be self - contained .",
    "we start with purely mathematical `` toy '' model which , as we will see later , is closely related with physical problems of polynuclear crystal growth ( section i.b ) and one - dimensional directed polymers ( section i.c ) .",
    "this combinatorial problem of statistical properties of the longest increasing subsequences ( lis ) was formulated long time ago by ulam @xcite , and hence it is often called the ulam s problem .",
    "let us consider a sequence of @xmath3 integers @xmath4 .",
    "then , for an arbitrary permutation of these integers we have to find all possible _ increasing _ subsequences , and among them the length @xmath5 of the longest ones should be defined . as an example",
    "let us consider the case @xmath6 and take a particular permutation @xmath7 this permutation exhibits many different increasing subsequences ( such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 etc . ) , and among them the longest ones are @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in other words , for this particular permutation @xmath12 .",
    "simple graphical representation of this permutation problem is shown in figure 1 . here",
    "the set of @xmath13 bold dots inside the @xmath14 square represents the permutation , eq.([1.1 ] ) : for every integer in the @xmath15 direction one associates one and only one _ permuted _ integer in the @xmath16 direction ( for @xmath17 one gets @xmath18 , for @xmath19 one gets @xmath20 , etc . ) .",
    "all possible increasing subsequences of this particular permutation are obtained by drawing all possible _ directed paths _ connecting the origin @xmath21 with the right up corner @xmath22 of this square , which are passing over the internal bold dots . directed path means that only  right - and - up ",
    "movements are allowed when going from one dot to another .",
    "for example ,",
    "from the point @xmath23 one can jump only to the points @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in other words , when going from the origin to the right up corner @xmath22 both @xmath15 and @xmath16 coordinates can only increase at every step . in terms of these rule ,",
    "the longest increasing subsequence is described by the directed path which goes over the maximum possible number of dots .",
    "note that for a given permutation the longest increasing subsequence is not necessary unique . in the considered example in addition to the subsequence",
    "@xmath10 shown in figure 1 by the dotted line , there exist another one namely @xmath11 .    ) , for @xmath6 .",
    "the dotted line corresponds the longest increasing subsequence @xmath10 , width=302 ]    [ figure1 ]    considering all @xmath27 possible permutations with equal probability one find that the length @xmath5 varies from permutation to permutation being the random variable .",
    "the question is what are the statistical properties of the random quantity @xmath5 .",
    "first it has been shown that in the limit of large @xmath3 , the average value of the longest increasing subsequence , @xmath28 , is proportional to @xmath29 , namely @xmath30 , where the constant @xmath31 @xcite . moreover , in the limit @xmath32 , the quantity @xmath5 in order @xmath29 is _ selfaveraging _",
    ": @xmath33 ( in other words , the distribution function of the ratio @xmath34 in the limit @xmath32 shrinks to the @xmath2-function ) .",
    "note that at the qualitative level one can easily understand why the typical value of @xmath5 must be proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , for large @xmath3 a generic permutation of the numbers @xmath4 in terms of the permutation matrix of figure 1 will be represented by a _",
    "uniform _ distribution of @xmath3 dots inside the @xmath0 square .",
    "thus the density of the dots will be proportional to @xmath35 while the typical distance between neighboring dots must be proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "it means that the typical number of dots on a diagonal - like path of the length @xmath36 must be proportional to @xmath37 .    however , the main interest in this system is not the typical value of the longest increasing subsequences , but their _",
    "fluctuations_. recently it has been shown @xcite that in the limit of large @xmath3 the fluctuations of @xmath5 scale as @xmath38 , namely , @xmath39 where the random quantity @xmath40 is described by the universal @xmath3-independent distribution function @xmath41 , which is the tracy - widom distribution ( see section i.e ) : @xmath42    it turns out that the above purely mathematical `` toy '' model is equivalent to the physical model of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional polynuclear crystal growth , where the tw distribution describes the fluctuations of the number of the crystal mono - layers ( see next subsection ) .",
    "it turns out that the mathematical `` toy '' model considered above is equivalent to the physical model of the crystal growth with randomly located nucleation centers .",
    "this is the model of _ polynuclear crystal growth _ ( png ) which describes the growth of the two - dimensional crystal monolayers in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "let us consider again figure 1 where the bold dots will be assumed to represent the nucleation centers .",
    "the crystal layers growth takes place in the vertical direction ( toward the reader ) according to the following rules . from each nucleation center",
    "we draw the monolayer level step straight line in the horizontal direction to the right and in the vertical direction up , until these lines meet with the other lines starting from the other centers . in this way we are getting the monolayer `` terraces '' which mount from the left - down to the right - up corner of the square .",
    "( see figure 2 ) .",
    "[ figure2 ]    one can easily see that for a given random positions of the nucleation centers ( for a given permutation in the previous lis problem ) the number of terraces @xmath43 is just equal to the longest increasing permutation @xmath5 in the combinatorial problem considered in the previous subsection . for a given value of @xmath3 , depending on the actual configurations of the nucleation centers inside the @xmath0 square ,",
    "the number of the monolayer terraces is the random quantity , and in the limit @xmath32 its statistics is described by the tw distribution , eq.([1.3 ] ) @xcite . at present",
    "the study of various modifications of png model formulated above is the vast field of research ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that quite recently the existence of tw distribution in the png - like systems has been confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is clear that when the size of the square @xmath3 is large the presence of the background lattice is not essential . in this case instead of considering the problem in terms of permutations one can introduce a homogeneous distribution of dots inside continuous square ( figure 3 ) .",
    "[ figure3 ]    let us introduce here the diagonal `` time '' axes which goes from the origin ( left down corner ) to the right up corner of the square .",
    "the directed polymer here is the line which starts at the origin and arrives to the right up corner `` jumping '' over the dots in such a way that its time coordinates increases at every jump . for a given ( random ) configuration of dots among many possible directed polymer trajectories we have to choose the ones which contains the maximum number of dots . in this formulation",
    "the problem of statistics of the length of such directed polymers looks somewhat different from the lis problem considered above .",
    "it can be shown however , that in the limit of large times @xmath44 and large @xmath3 these two problems become equivalent @xcite . for a given ( fixed )",
    "density @xmath45 of dots instead of the total number of dots @xmath3 one can measure the length @xmath46 of the polymer in terms of the size of the square @xmath44 . since @xmath47 , assuming that @xmath45 is a parameter which is of the order of one , we note that @xmath48 .",
    "in this case we find that the fluctuations of the length of the polymers scales as @xmath49 , and instead of eq.([1.3 ] ) we get @xmath50 in other words in the _ thermodynamic limit _ ,",
    "@xmath51 all the systems considered above appear to be equivalent to each other which does nt look so much surprising if we compare figures 1 - 3 .",
    "in statistical physics one defines random directed polymers in somewhat different way .",
    "let us introduce a square lattice in which discrete `` time '' @xmath52 is now horizontal ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the vertical direction is described by the discrete parameter @xmath53 . at every lattice site",
    "@xmath54 we place random quantities ( random potential ) @xmath55 and assume that they are described by _",
    "independent _ gaussian distributions : @xmath56 \\ ; = \\ ; \\prod_{\\phi , t }   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\pi u } } \\exp\\bigl(-\\frac{1}{2u } v^{2}(\\phi , t)\\bigr)\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath57 defines the typical strength of the random potentials @xmath55 , which according to eq.([1.5 ] ) are uncorrelated @xmath58 and have zero mean value , @xmath59 ( the horizontal line denotes the averaging with the distribution , eq.([1.5 ] ) ) .        [ figure4 ]",
    "the directed polymer here is the path which starts at the origin and goes over the lattice sites to the right end of the system . at every time step ,",
    "@xmath60 the polymer trajectory @xmath61 , can deviate up or down by one step or may not deviate at all : @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",
    "assuming that the polymer is a kind of elastic string we can introduce `` elastic '' ( positive ) energy @xmath64^{2}$ ] for every polymer s deviation . in this way for a given trajectory @xmath61 we can associate the following _ energy _ : @xmath65\\ ; = \\ ; \\sum_{t=1}^{l-1 } \\bigl[\\frac{1}{2 } \\bigl[\\phi(t+1 ) - \\phi(t)\\bigr]^{2 } + v(\\phi(t ) , t ) \\bigr]\\ ] ] this expression contains two competing contributions : the first ( elastic ) terms are trying to make the trajectory as horizontal as possible , while the second ones are forcing the trajectory to deviate in the search for the most negative values of the random potentials .",
    "for a given ( random ) configuration of the potentials @xmath55 the optimal trajectory @xmath66 is defined by the minimum of the total energy , eq.([1.7 ] ) , @xmath67^{2 } + v(\\phi(t ) , t ) \\bigr ] \\biggr\\}\\ ] ] being the function of the random potential @xmath55 this quantity is also random , and it could be considered as the distant analog of the ( random ) length of the directed polymers in the previous example shown in figure 3 .",
    "an essential difference is that in this latter case the elastic terms are absent , while the ( negative ) contribution of the potential energy is associated with a fixed energy @xmath68 carried by the dots which ( unlike the gaussian random potentials @xmath55 ) are _ geometrically _ random .",
    "one more important difference is that unlike the directed polymer in figure 4 , which is defined by the _",
    "local _ in space one - step wandering , the trajectory in figure 3 can jump _ any distance _ from dot to dot ( not necessary between neighboring dots ) .",
    "thus , _ a priori _ there are no reasons to expect that these two quantities , @xmath69 , eq.([1.8 ] ) , and @xmath46 in the example of figure 3 would have the same statistical properties .",
    "if , nevertheless , we would _ suppose _ that at least in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath70 , these two types of systems become equivalent we would have to expect that @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the _ bulk _ ( selfaveraging ) energy density and the random parameter @xmath40 is described by @xmath73-independent tw distribution function .",
    "the system defined by the hamiltonian ( [ 1.7 ] ) is the usual one - dimensional statistical system containing quenched disorder .",
    "the fact that the leading contribution to its ground state energy @xmath69 is proportional to the system size @xmath73 can be explained in very simple way .",
    "indeed , in the first approximation , to minimize the energy at every time step among three possible options ( `` up'',``horizontal '' and `` down '' ) the trajectory of figure 4 can choose the site where the value of the random potential @xmath55 is lower ( in this approximation we neglect the presence of non - local phenomena when the optimal trajectory chooses locally unfavorable option to gain globally more favorable energy ) .",
    "in this way the second term in eq.([1.7 ] ) provides the contribution which is proportional to @xmath74 ( and not @xmath75 , as it would be for an _ arbitrary _ trajectory @xmath61 ) . since the contribution of the first ( elastic ) term in eq.([1.7 ] ) is also proportional to @xmath73 , we find that in the leading order in @xmath73 , the energy of the optimal trajectory @xmath76 , and moreover , we can be sure that this contribution is negative since the energy of the optimal trajectory in the absence on the random potentials is zero ( it is just the straight horizontal line ) , while the presence of the random potential can only lower the energy . on the other hand",
    "the fact that _ finite - size corrections _ in this system are of order @xmath77 ( and _ not _ of order @xmath78 , as one could naively expect ) is highly non - trivial phenomenon which is very difficult to explain in simple terms .    the lattice model as it is introduced above , eqs.([1.7])-([1.8 ] )",
    ", is essentially the zero - temperature system , as we are dealing here with the optimal ( global minimum ) trajectories only .",
    "it is clear that the search for the global minimum configurations in eq.([1.8 ] ) is highly non - trivial task , as it can not be done via the local in time algorithms . on the other hand , as it often happens",
    ", one can make life much easier if one consider more general ( i.e. more complicated ) problem .",
    "namely , let us introduce finite _ temperature _ @xmath79 in the system so that in addition to the quenched disorder fluctuations we would have the contributions of the thermal fluctuations produced by the trajectories away from the global minima ones . in terms of this generalization instead of the global minimum energy @xmath69 , eq.([1.8 ] ) , we would get the _ free energy _ : @xmath80\\bigr ) \\bigr]\\ ] ] where the expression under the logarithm is the partition function in which the summation goes over _ all _ trajectories starting at the origin . in the case",
    "the global minimum trajectory is unique ( which is usually the case in the large system ) the energy defined in eq.([1.8 ] ) is obtained by taking the zero temperature limit : @xmath81 . the finite temperature lattice model defined by eqs.([1.7]),([1.9 ] ) is sufficiently simple for numerical investigations ( see e.g. @xcite ) which in particular allows to demonstrate the existence of the free energy fluctuations scaling @xmath82 . on the other hand ,",
    "the problem defined on a lattice is very hard for analytical studies . since the phenomena of interest are taking place at large system sizes",
    ", one may hope that it would be sufficient to consider the system in the continuous limit where the presence of a lattice become irrelevant .",
    "continuous limit generalization of the hamiltonian , eq.([1.7 ] ) is straightforward . assuming that the lattice spacing goes to zero and changing the finite differences in its first term by the gradients we get @xmath83\\ ;",

    "indeed , the probability that at time @xmath89 the trajectory arrives to the point @xmath90 is given by the partition function @xmath91   \\ ;   \\exp\\biggl\\{-\\frac{1}{2 t } \\int_{0}^{l } d\\tau \\biggl[\\frac{d\\phi(\\tau)}{d\\tau}\\biggr]^{2 } \\biggr\\}\\ ] ] simple gaussian integration ( with the proper choice of the _ integration measure _ of the functional integral ) yields @xmath92 in other words the typical deviation @xmath93 of the trajectory due to the _ thermal fluctuations _ growth as @xmath94 ( and it shrinks to zero at @xmath95 ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the presence of the random potential the two terms of the hamiltonian ( [ 1.10 ] ) must balance each other . for a given value of the typical deviation @xmath96 the contribution of the elastic term",
    "can be estimated as @xmath97 .",
    "thus , if in the presence of disorder the free energy fluctuations of this system are scaling as @xmath77 ( see e.g. @xcite ) we can conclude that the typical value of the trajectory deviations due to the action of the random potentials must grow as @xmath98 which is much faster than the pure thermal diffusion scaling @xmath78 .    in what follows we are going to study the system defined by eqs.([1.10]),([1.11 ] ) in all detail .",
    "it turns out that regardless of essential differences in the definition of this system and the previous models discussed above in sections 1.a-1.c , in the thermodynamic limit all these models becomes _ equivalent_. the central result which will be proved in the next sections is in the following . in the limit @xmath99 the free energy of the considered system can be represented as @xmath100 where @xmath72 is the linear free energy density , the constant @xmath101 , and the random quantity @xmath102 ( just like the quantity @xmath40 in eqs.([1.2])-([1.4 ] ) ) is described by the universal tw distribution function ( see section i.e )      the replica method is widely used in the studies of systems containing quenched disorder ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for simplicity",
