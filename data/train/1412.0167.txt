    "hundreds of planetary systems have been discovered through radial velocity @xcite and transit measurements @xcite . however , this breakthrough is currently biased toward planetary architectures that may have experienced much more dynamical evolution and reflect conditions that are different from our own solar system .",
    "probing planets similar to our own solar system ( giant planets located outside 5 au with orbital periods longer than 10 years ) requires either long - term monitoring or advanced instruments that can significantly reduce the light from the host stars , which are both technically challenging .",
    "debris disks offer an indirect way to study outer planetary systems .",
    "debris disks are tenuous dusty structures sustained through collisions of leftover planetesimals and minor bodies such as asteroids , kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) and comets ( often referred as parent bodies ) , that failed to form planets .",
    "the loss timescale for dust in a typical debris system is generally less than 10@xmath3 years ; therefore , the presence of dust around a main - sequence star requires a replenishing reservoir and one or more large bodies providing dynamical stirring to maintain a high rate of collisions among the debris parent - body reservoir .",
    "the large surface area of debris makes these disks detectable through infrared and millimeter thermal emission or optical scattered light , providing insights into the nature of unseen parent - body populations and massive planetary perturbers .",
    "because debris disks are detected from just after the protoplanetary stage to nearly the end of the star s life billions of years later , they are excellent observational tools to study the growth of planets and subsequent dramatic steps that determine the architecture of planetary systems .    in our solar system , the stable locations of the leftover planetesimals ( i.e. , the asteroid and kuiper belts )",
    "are tightly coupled with the architecture of the planets . in an analogous fashion ,",
    "the observed debris structures around other stars such as the tilted inner disk in @xmath4 pic @xcite and the eccentric ring in fomalhaut @xcite have long been used to predict the presence of unseen planets .",
    "this connection became even more persuasive when the first few directly imaged planets were discovered around debris - host stars ( hr 8799 : @xcite , fomalhaut : @xcite , and @xmath4 pic : @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , some debris systems are known to possess dust emission at two different temperatures , suggesting a cold outer belt accompanied by a fainter , warm inner one ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although there might be many mechanisms to explain such a large gap , a probable way to maintain this structure is shown by the four super - jupiter - like planets around hr 8799 @xcite , which are packed between inner and outer debris disk components as revealed by resolved imaging and detailed analysis of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) @xcite .",
    "the similar large gaps between the inner and outer debris components around other stars may be maintained by lower - mass planets ; for example , in the debris disk twins ( vega and fomalhaut ) , we have strong evidence that the large gap between the warm asteroid - like and the cold kbo - like dust belts is an excellent signpost for multiple ice - giant - mass planets beyond the ice line @xcite .",
    "a large gap of this type between the inner warm and outer cold belts is an example of a global disk feature that points toward general aspects of planetary system formation and evolution .",
    "the seds of debris disks can be understood , to first order , by assuming that there are various zones that are maintained by common factors , e.g. , fossil ice lines and ice giant planets .",
    "the diversity of disk structures and seds then reflect variations in the amount of material in these zones , that are closely related to different paths by which a system forms and evolves , rather than radical differences in structure @xcite .",
    "hence , systems that harbor directly - imaged planets and debris disks are valuable tools to better understand planetary system formation and evolution .    in this study",
    ", we focus on the planetary system around hd 95086 . the star is an early - type member of the lower centaurus crux association ( lcc ; @xcite ) , and located 90.4@xmath53.4 pc away @xcite .",
    "the age of the star has been reviewed by @xcite with an estimate of 17 myr ( @xmath52 myr statistical and @xmath54 myr systematic ) .",
    "hd 95086 has drawn a lot of attention lately because it hosts a directly imaged planet hd 95086b at a projected distance of 56 au @xcite .",
    "the planet has very red infrared colors , similar to young massive planets hr 8799 bcde and 2 m 1207b , with a mass estimate of 5@xmath52 @xmath0 based on evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "hd 95086 also has a prominent infrared excess with a dust fractional luminosity ( @xmath6 ) of 1.6@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the debris around hd 95086 was marginally resolved at far - infrared wavelengths with _ herschel _ , suggesting a slightly inclined orientation from face - on @xcite .",
    "there are some inconsistencies in the disk properties of hd 95086 in the literature .",
    "we , therefore , review existing infrared photometric and spectroscopic data , and present an unpublished _ spitzer _ mips - sed low - resolution spectrum covering 5595 @xmath1  for a comprehensive disk sed analysis ( section 2 ) . to thoroughly exploit the opportunity that the hd 95086 system provides , we also re - analyze the _ herschel _ resolved images in comparison with the sed modeling results , and",
    "conclude that the resolved debris structure is mostly in the form of a disk halo composed of small grains ( section 3 ) . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the similarity between hd 95086 and hr 8799 in their debris distribution , and provide dynamical constraints on possible planetary configurations in hd 95086 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "we present unpublished _ spitzer _ mips - sed data and review all published infrared / submillimeter observations for the hd 95086 system .",
    "our goal is to construct a detailed disk sed that can be used to estimate the location of debris within the system .      _",
    "spitzer _ mips photometry was first published by @xcite where fluxes were extracted using point spread function ( psf ) fitting designed for point sources .",
    "we examined the 24 @xmath1  image , and found the source is slightly extended ( full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 598@xmath8587 , compared to a typical point source s fwhm 549@xmath5003@xmath8545@xmath5003 ) . therefore , we adopted measurements with photometry through a large aperture ( aperture radius of 149 and sky annulus of 299423 ) , resulting in 52.95@xmath50.55 mjy as the total 24 @xmath1  flux for the system ( @xmath216% higher than the psf extracted flux ) . at 70 @xmath1 ,",
    "the source is point - like with a total flux of 655@xmath533 mjy .",
    "the quoted flux uncertainties include instrumental repeatability , which is 1% and 5% at 24 and 70 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "_ herschel _ pacs and spire observations were first published by @xcite , and showed that the disk was resolved at 70 and 100 @xmath1  with an estimated inclination angle of 25 . because the _ herschel _ observations were reduced with an older pipeline ( hipe v9.2 ) , we re - reduced the data with an updated pipeline ( hipe v13.0 ) that incorporated many new calibration improvements detailed in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we included the experimental tool for pointing reconstruction based on the gyroscope information that considerably reduces the pointing jitter and increases the stability of the psf ( termed as gyro correction ) .",
    "finally , we mosaicked the final maps with a default `` pixfrac '' parameter 1.0 , equivalent to drizzle parameter of 0.8 , in the instrumental orientation so the psf structures were always in the same location .",
    "no rotation / interpolation is then needed in further psf subtraction analyses .",
    "detailed analysis of the pacs images is presented in section 3.1 .",
    "we used an aperture size of 22  at all three bands to measure the source flux , at which radius the encircled flux reached the maximum and flattened afterward ( after proper aperture correction ) .",
    "we did not apply color correction for the pacs fluxes .",
    "the final pacs fluxes are : 688@xmath548 , 688@xmath548 , and 489@xmath535 mjy at 70 , 100 , and 160 @xmath1 , respectively , in good agreement with the @xcite published results .    inspecting the spire maps ,",
    "the source is clearly detected at all three wavelengths as a point source , and the surrounding field has no bright source or large - scale extended structure .",
    "therefore , we used the level 2 point - source product ( jy / beam ) provided by the herschel science center ( hipe ver .",
    "11 ) to measure fluxes .",
    "we used the peak value of the source to estimate the point - source flux . after correcting the pixelisation effect ( 0.951 , 0.931 , 0.902 at 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath1 , respectively ; spire handbook , version 2.5 , 2014 ) ,",
    "the source submillimeter fluxes are : 186@xmath516 mjy , 112@xmath516 mjy , and 67@xmath517 mjy at 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath1 , respectively . at 500 @xmath1",
    ", there are a couple of faint peaks within 40  of the target , which might contaminate the submillimeter fluxes .",
    "no color correction was applied for the spire fluxes either .",
    "our spire fluxes are lower than the values published by @xcite who extracted source fluxes using aperture photometry , but consistent within uncertainties .",
    "finally , hd 95086 was detected at 870 @xmath1  with the submillimeter telescope apex by @xcite .",
    "its nominal beam size is 192 ( fwhm ) , but the effective resolution is 27after filtering and smoothing in the data reduction @xcite .",
    "the source at 870 @xmath1  appears to be elongated ( figure 2 in @xcite ) and surrounded by faint peaks .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the measured 870 @xmath1  flux ( 41.3@xmath518.4 mjy ) is over - estimated and contaminated by background galaxies .",

    "irs spectrum of the system was first published by @xcite where the excess spectrum was characterized by blackbody emission of 80@xmath530 k. the same spectrum was reduced and analyzed by @xcite , who found the spectral shape of the excess along with long - wavelength photometry is better fitted with two blackbody temperatures : 187@xmath526 k and 57@xmath51.5 k. finally , @xcite characterized the excess to be consistent with two temperatures : 225@xmath9 k and 57@xmath55 k. the warm temperature discrepancy might be due to how the two irs modules were joined and scaled relative to the photosphere .",
    "for this reason , we also performed the irs data reduction , similar to what was done in @xcite but with the smart software ( ver .",

    "the two low resolution modules ( short - low ( sl ) : 5.214.5 @xmath1  and long - low ( ll ) : 14.038.0 @xmath1 ) were extracted and combined independently using smart s optimal 2 nod extraction @xcite .",
    "the sl spectrum agrees very well ( @xmath101% ) with the expected kurucz model flux for wavelengths shorter than 6.5 @xmath1 , while the ll spectrum was scaled down ( by 0.963 ) to match the mips 24 @xmath1  large aperture photometry .",
    "the two modules then joined smoothly without further scaling .",
    "the photospheric contribution was subtracted using the best - fit kurucz model ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , and 2% of the photospheric emission was included in computing the excess flux uncertainty .",

    "our best - fit ( weighted by the uncertainty ) two blackbody temperatures are 55@xmath55 k ( cold component ) and 175@xmath525 k ( warm component ) .",
    "the large error in the warm temperature is driven by the large uncertainty in the 710 @xmath1  excess flux after photospheric subtraction .",
    "the 175 k blackbody emission slightly ( within 1@xmath13 ) under predicts the excess flux shortward of 10 @xmath1 , suggesting either the system has another faint , hotter component or the emission from the warm component has a weak silicate feature from @xmath2@xmath1-size grains . we have used the fitting technique developed by @xcite , including various normalizations of the photosphere , to evaluate this emission .",
    "we find no evidence for silicate emission features , thus differing from * those * excesses identified by @xcite ; instead , within the errors , a @xmath2300 k blackbody is an adequate fit . adding this component has negligible effect on the fitted temperature of the 175 k component ( reducing its temperature by about 10 k ) . given its large uncertainty , we do not include this tentative , faint and hotter component in our following discussion .",

    "we investigated the discrepancy and were not able to find an obvious reason outside the possible transient systematic errors in the array around 80 @xmath1 .",
    "however , the feature at @xmath270 @xmath1  appears to be real since it consists of two high points that are @xmath153@xmath13 above the overall continuum , and several adjacent points that are consistent with the instrumental resolution , unlike the single low point at 80 @xmath1 .",
    "we have also checked other mips - sed spectra for sources that have similar 70 @xmath1  fluxes as hd 95086 , and none were found to have such an emission feature , suggesting that it is not due to instrumental artifacts .",
    "the shape of the mips - sed spectrum is consistent with the broad - band photometry measured by pacs and mips at 70 @xmath1 . since the bandwidth of the mips 70 @xmath1  filter is wider than that of the pacs 70 @xmath1  filter , the slightly lower value of the mips 70 @xmath1  measurement is consistent with the presence of the expected feature .",
    "a lorentzian profile fit to the mips - sed spectrum suggests that the feature peaks at 69.5@xmath50.5 @xmath1  with a linewidth ( fwhm ) of 4.2 @xmath1 , consistent with an emission - line feature that is not spectrally resolved in the mips - sed mode .",

    "the model images were constructed for a given model description , projected to the inclination angle of 25 , then convolved with the appropriate psf .",
    "we then computed the azimuthally averaged radial profiles for both the observed and model data for comparison . since pacs 70 @xmath1  and 100 @xmath1  channels have the better resolutions , we derived the best - fit parameters only for the 70/100 @xmath1  data , and verified them with the 160 @xmath1  data .",

    "as we discuss in section 3.2 , the resolved structure in the hd 95086 system most likely arises from the disk halo component composed of only small grains that can be warm enough to emit efficiently at far - infrared wavelengths to account for the extended structure seen in the pacs images .",

    "unlike the hr 8799 sb profiles where two power - laws were required to fit the data , one single power - law model provides satisfactory fits to the hd 95086 data .      to guide the sed modeling , we first computed the thermal equilibrium dust temperature distribution around hd 95086 ( figure [ radius_td ] ) with assumed grain properties in an optically thin environment .",
    "we adopted two grain compositions : astronomical silicates and ice - coated silicates .",
    "we used the optical constants from @xcite and mie theory code to compute the grain absorption and scattering efficiency for compact , spherical astronomical silicates .",
    "for the absorption and scattering efficiency of icy grains , we used both multi - layer mie calculations as well as standard effective medium theory rules ( garnett and bruggeman equation ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the inner warm belt ,",
    "we adopt compact astronomical silicates as the composition for the sed fitting since the majority of the ice should be sublimated at the warm belt temperature . for the outer cold disk ,",
    "we use the icy grains composed of compact silicate cores with icy mantles that occupy 30% of the grain volume .",
    "the thickness of the icy mantles is chosen so that the resultant model emission produces a good overall fit in the 6070 @xmath1  region .",
    "figure [ radius_td ] shows that in terms of these two grain compositions ( non - icy vs.  icy ) the resultant temperatures for grains larger than @xmath210 @xmath1  are not very different , but they could have @xmath1510 k difference for @xmath1-size grains closer in . the observed two characteristic temperatures ( @xmath2175 k and @xmath255",
    "k ) suggest two distinct dust locations ( @xmath27 au and @xmath260 au ) for blackbody - like grains .",
    "since fine debris is generated through collisional cascades by breaking up large parent bodies , we expect a full spectrum of particle sizes in a debris disk , generally in a power - law form , @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the number density , @xmath33 for the grain radius and @xmath34 3.53.7 @xcite .",
    "thus , the majority of particles in a collisional dominated disk are grains just slightly larger than the minimum grain size in the distribution ( i.e. , the average grain size is @xmath10@xmath33@xmath35 where @xmath36 is the minimum size of grains existing in a steady - state collisional disk ) . in a debris disk ( no /",
    "very little gas ) , in addition to the gravitational force of the star , dust grains are subject to radiation pressure .",
    "therefore , grains that are smaller than the blowout size ( @xmath37 ) are removed from the system , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "the blowout size is a function of stellar mass ( @xmath39 ) , luminosity ( @xmath40 ) and grain density ( @xmath41 ) given by @xmath42 in units of @xmath1 .",
    "given the stellar parameters for hd 95086 ( @xmath40@xmath27 @xmath43 and @xmath39@xmath21.6",

    "therefore , the average grain sizes in such a collisionally dominated disk are @xmath23 @xmath1 .",
    "we also set the maximum grain radius ( @xmath47 ) to be 1000 @xmath1 ; grains larger than this size have negligible contribution to the model emission .",

    "the extension of the cold disk derived from the observed sed ( radius @xmath22200 au ) implies that the cold disk should not have been resolved with _",
    "s resolution ( fwhm of 56 at best )",
    ". we can obtain reasonable sed fits to the cold disk by extending it up to @xmath2800 au ; however , the surface density distribution has to have a steeper drop - off ( @xmath65 compared to a flat disk of @xmath66 ) .",
    "this very wide planetesimal disk , perhaps analogous to the solar system s scattered disk of kbos , could generate dust grains in - situ from collisions . using a uniform particle size distribution ( @xmath67 ) at all astro - centric distances up to @xmath2800 au ,",
    "the resultant model images from such a wide disk with a steep radial gradient of surface density ( @xmath2@xmath65 ) are similar to the ones using much smaller outer disk radii , i.e. , not resolved . in order to account for the detected far - infrared emission at large astro - centric distances up to @xmath2800 au ,",
    "an extended component composed of only small dust grains on unbound or barely bound orbits ( i.e. , a disk halo ) is our best alternative .",
    "these small grains are most likely generated in the cold belt which may include a very wide scattered disk structure .",
    "however , given that the source is only resolved at @xmath221.4 beams , no meaningful constraint can be placed based on the images .    without some information on the brightness of the planetesimal belt , there is a wide range of parameters in this three - component sed model that can produce satisfactory fits .",
    "for example , if we assume the contribution of the planetesimal belt in the sed is roughly equal to the point source fluxes that are scaled to match the peak fluxes of the pacs images for subtraction , we are able to construct a three - component model that fits the overall sed ( figure [ modelsed]b ) and the far - infrared images . in this three - component model , the warm component is assumed to be the same as the two - component model ( it has negligible contribution at far - infrared ) , and the emission at far - infrared is partitioned into the planetesimal belt ( blue line in figure [ modelsed]b ) and disk halo ( red line in figure [ modelsed]b ) .",
    "the planetesimal - belt component has a dust fractional luminosity of @xmath28@xmath63 and a total dust mass of @xmath20.2@xmath68 while the disk halo component has one third ( @xmath23@xmath63 ) of the fractional luminosity in the planetesimal - belt component , but only @xmath210% of the dust mass as a result of the disk halo being composed of @xmath2@xmath1  size grains .",
    "figure [ resim]b shows a detailed comparison between the observed and three - component model images at 70 @xmath1 .",
    "overall , the residual suggests the three - component model agrees with the observation within @xmath52@xmath13 .",
    "due to the large distance of hd 95086 , the warm excess is inferred from the sed only , unlike for other nearby debris systems ( vega and fomalhaut @xcite , and @xmath69 eri @xcite ) where the warm and cold components are spatially separated .",
    "recently , @xcite presented an informative way to examine the properties of two - temperature disks , and tested the hypothesis that emission from a single narrow belt can account for the two observed temperatures by varying the particle size distribution .",
    "they conclude that the one - narrow - belt scenario is unlikely to produce two observed dust temperatures around early - type stars if the blowout size is preserved .",
    "furthermore , the derived temperature and fractional luminosity ratios between the hd 95086 warm and cold components ( @xmath70 and @xmath710.10.2 ) are located right at the center of the @xmath72 vs. @xmath73 plot ( figure 5 in @xcite ) , indicating that varying the particle size distribution in a narrow belt is unlikely to explain the observed sed .",
    "another possibility is that the warm excess emission could result from the small amount of particles being dragged in due to p - r drag .",
    "the effect of p - r drag in collisional dominated debris disks has been studied analytically by @xcite . in the case of the hd 95086 disk ( a planetesimal belt at @xmath2100 au with @xmath74 producing excess emission at @xmath210 au ) ,",
    "the maximum amount of material available due to p - r drag in terms of optical depth is @xmath100.05@xmath75 .",

    "thus , the observed value @xmath761.5@xmath63 for the warm component , is a factor of 20 higher than the maximum value that the cold belt can supply due to p - r drag , making this hypothesis unlikely .",
    "we , therefore , consider the warm component as an independent belt in the following discussion .",

    "the feature detected in the hd 95086 mips - sed data is not spectrally resolved , we can not put constraints on the fraction of iron composition as has been done for @xmath4 pic @xcite ; however the iron fraction has to be less than a few % to have the feature peaked at 69 @xmath1  at @xmath250 k.    to further validate the detection of the forsterite 69 @xmath1  feature and derive a rough estimate of the crystalline abundance , we took the mass absorption coefficients of synthetic forsterite ( fo100 in @xcite ) , and constructed simple model fits to the mips - sed data .",
    "the model has two components : ( 1 ) emission from the crystalline forsterite and ( 2 ) a blackbody emission representing the underlying dust continuum , with both at the temperature of 55 k derived for the cold component .",
    "the model spectrum was smoothed to match the mips - sed resolution , and the ratio between the two components was adjusted to fit the overall shape of the mips - sed data . since we do not have information about the location where the 69 @xmath1  feature originates",
    ", the temperature of this component is not necessarily the same as that of the cold disk ( underlying continuum ) .",
    "however , we can easily rule out the possibility that these crystalline grains originate from the warm belt with a dust temperature of @xmath2175 k since the blue part ( 5060 @xmath1 ) of the model spectrum would have a much bluer slope .",
    "given that the continuum in both blue and red sides of the feature is relatively flat , we assume the crystalline grains are located in the cold disk with the same dust temperature as the underlying continuum .",
    "[ fo100 ]    the upper panel of figure [ fo100 ] shows the best - fit model where the total mass of the forsterite component is @xmath26.2@xmath77 g ( 0.01 @xmath68 ) .",
    "using the total dust mass we derived from the cold disk ( 0.2 @xmath68 , section 3.2 ) , the abundance of the crystalline grains is @xmath25% .",
    "this abundance is likely to be a lower limit because the laboratory measured absorption coefficients are based on finely ground powder ( sizes of 0.10.5 @xmath1 ) , and the 69 @xmath1  feature is not sensitive to grain size ( the band profiles are similar for grains less than @xmath210 @xmath1 , @xcite )  band profiles at different grain sizes are all much smaller than the spectral resolution of the mips - sed mode data . ] . since no prominent crystalline features are seen in the observed 2040 @xmath1  range ( while our best - fit model predicts strong features )",
    ", the crystalline grains must have sizes @xmath15 a few @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the derived abundance should be taken as a lower limit .",
    "the presence of crystalline silicates at a low temperature and far from the star is surprising , given that relatively high temperatures are required to convert circumstellar amorphous silicates to the crystalline form @xcite .",
    "the detection of the forsterite emission feature implies that there is a substantial transport of material from the inner zone of the system , or that material has been released from the disruption of a large body where high temperatures were reached during formation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the 69 @xmath1  feature was not detected in the mips - sed data of @xmath4 pic ( the bottom panel of figure [ fo100 ] ) , while the crystalline abundance is estimated to be 3.6@xmath51.0% using the pacs spectroscopic data @xcite .",
    "with the published pacs spectrum smoothed to match the mips - sed resolution , we found that the low equivalent width of the detected feature is completely washed out in the mips - sed mode ( the inset of the bottom panel of figure [ fo100 ] ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the derived mass values for the crystalline grains ( 2.8@xmath78 g for the @xmath4 pic disk , while the mass we estimate for hd 95086 is @xmath15200 times more ) .",
    "the estimated crystalline abundances implied by the observed feature strengths in these two systems appear discrepant .",

    ", the total non - crystalline , derived dust mass by @xcite is a factor of @xmath23 lower than the value ( 4.7@xmath80 g ) derived from recent alma observation for @xmath4 pic @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the reported 3.6% crystalline abundance is only based on one of the temperature components ( @xmath290 k with a total mass of 8@xmath81 g ) .",
    "using the alma derived dust mass , the crystalline abundance in the @xmath4 pic disk should be @xmath221 % . as we compare the disk properties between hd 95086 and hr 8799 in the following subsection , it is also noteworthy that no feature was detected in the mips - sed data around hr 8799 ( figure [ fo100 ] ) @xcite , suggesting the crystalline abundance is @xmath101 % .",
    "the eccentricity , @xmath82 , of debris disks usually can be measured in two ways : ( 1 ) the offset between the ring center and star position , and ( 2 ) the degree of asymmetry seen in thermal images ( i.e. , pericenter glow ) .",
    "both methods have been applied to the fomalhaut debris disk @xcite and result in a consistent value ( @xmath83 ) . since the star contributes negligibly in the pacs wavelengths , the centroid we measured from the pacs images is the center of the disk .",
    "based on the calibration observations of the psf star , @xmath21 dra , a typical centroiding uncertainty is 001 .",
    "the position of the star is well measured by 2mass with a known proper motion from hipparcos ; therefore , the uncertainty in its position relative to the _ herschel _ detection is dominated by the absolute accuracy of the world coordinate systems ( wcs ) in _ herschel_/pacs maps .",
    "we used a bright galaxy ( leda 3079352 , 2mass j10571665 - 6838171 ) present in the field of our pacs images to estimate the absolute pointing uncertainty .",
    "there appears to be an offset of @xmath222 between the 2mass and _ herschel _ coordinate systems .",
    "the typical pointing uncertainty in _ herschel _ observations ( @xmath22 ) makes it difficult to pin point the star position with high accuracy ( i.e. , the first method is inapplicable ) .",
    "we then turned to the second method to assess the degree of asymmetry we could have detected with _",
    "herschel _ observations .",
    "since the resolved structure is mostly dominated by the disk halo ( the planetsimal belt is not resolved at _ herschel _ s resolution ) , the presumption is that the disk halo shape follows closely with that of the planetesimal belt .",
    "this assumption is reasonable if the disk halo results from small grains generated in the parent - body belt that are ejected and/or placed in highly eccentric orbits due to radiation pressure .",
    "there appears to be some asymmetry seen in the psf - subtracted images ( bottom row of figure [ pacs_im ] ) ; however , it is not significant ( less than 3@xmath13 ) .",
    "the resolved component is consistent with the circular case with @xmath84 ( our baseline model shown in figure [ modelsed]b and figure [ resim]b ) .",
    "we then constructed model images by placing the disk halo components at various eccentricities and compared them with our baseline model .",
    "we found that the difference is noticeable ( more than 5@xmath13 ) when @xmath85 . from this exercise ,",
    "we conclude that the resolved structure ( disk halo ) around hd 95086 has @xmath86 .",
    "given that both hr 8799 and hd 95086 have bright debris disks and wide - orbit planets revealed via direct imaging , it is instructive to compare their properties in regard to different aspects of the planetary configuration .",
    "table [ tbl : comp ] lists the properties of the hr 8799 and hd 95086 systems .",
    "the debris structures revealed from excess seds and resolved images show that both systems have a warm ( @xmath2170 k ) excess near the water - ice line and a cold excess at @xmath250 k , surrounded by an extended disk halo .",
    "the hd 95086 system is @xmath210 times dustier than the hr 8799 in terms of fractional dust luminosity , but the ratio of fractional luminosities of the warm and cold components is similar ( @xmath20.1 ) . the extended disk halo in hr 8799 can be traced up to @xmath22000 au with a sensitivity of 10@xmath87 mjy arcsec@xmath88 @xcite ; interestingly , a similar size is seen in the hd 95086 system with the same detection limit , implying its disk halo is @xmath895 times brighter given that it is @xmath22.3 times more distant .",
    "based on the resolved images , @xcite estimated the hr 8799 disk halo accounts for 40% , 46% and 52% of the total flux at 70 , 100 and 160 @xmath1 , respectively . in the case of hd 95086 , the marginally resolved images can only give a lower limit for the contribution from the disk halo , which is @xmath1542% , @xmath1539% and @xmath1527% at 70 , 100 and 160 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "in other words , the debris structures in these two systems are very similar except that the debris in the hd 95086 system is @xmath210 times more in dust luminosities and 25 times more in observed dust masses ( derived from sed fitting ) compared to those values in the hr 8799 system .    ccccc stellar parameter & & & & + @xmath39 [ @xmath44 ] & & + @xmath40 [ @xmath43 ] & & + @xmath92 [ k ] & & + @xmath93 [ @xmath94 & & + age [ myr ] & & + distance [ pc ] & & +   + sed parameter & & & & + & _ warm _ & _ cold _ & _ warm _ & _ cold",

    "the age estimate of hd 95086 ( @xmath220 myr ) is quite robust given its association with the lcc moving group ; but the age of hr 8799 has been widely debated .",
    "most of the dating methods applicable for early - type stars favor an age younger than @xmath2150 myr @xcite , while asteroseismic analysis based on the ground - based data favors an older age of @xmath21 gyr @xcite .",
    "recent optical monitoring using the microvariability and oscillations in stars ( most ) space data found significant frequency and amplitude changes in hr 8799 s pulsation , making precise asteroseismic analysis difficult @xcite .",
    "the age of hr 8799 was revisited by @xcite with the directly measured stellar diameter from interferometric chara data and evolutionary models , who derived two age estimates : 33@xmath103 myr if the star is still contracting toward the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) , and 90@xmath104 myr if the star is evolving from zams .",
    "therefore , it is possible that hr 8799 could be as young as hd 95086 ( 20 myr ) , but it is more likely older , by up to @xmath15 10 times .    if both hr 8799 and hd 95086 are at the same age , the difference in the observed dust level must reflect different initial conditions .",
    "based on the evolution models of debris disks developed by @xcite , the relative disk luminosity ( @xmath6 ) around a 2 @xmath44 star at age of 20 myr can be up to 10 times higher if one disk started with 10 times more mass than the other ( figure 17 in that paper ) .",
    "this suggests that hr 8799 was born with a less massive protoplanetary disk than that of hd 95086 if both have the same age .",
    "however , all four directly imaged planets in the hr 8799 system are @xmath22 times more massive than the hd 95086 planet , implying the opposite trend in initial conditions . alternatively , if both systems formed with similar initial conditions ( mass and angular momentum ) , the difference in the dust level must be related to debris evolution .",
    "the models by @xcite predict the decline in disk luminosity is roughly a power law , @xmath105 with @xmath1060.61.0 . with possible ages of 40200 myr for hr 8799 ,",
    "the differences in @xmath6 between hd 95086 and hr 8799 suggest @xmath1071.03.3 , a steeper decline than the model prediction .",
    "perhaps the biggest difference between these two systems is that hr 8799 hosts four massive ( 79 @xmath0 ) planets between the warm and cold belts , while there is only one @xmath25 @xmath0 planet currently known that is just interior to the hd 95086 cold belt .",
    "because hd 95086 is more than two times more distant than hr 8799 , the current direct imaging observations are only sensitive to @xmath155 @xmath0 as close as @xmath230 au to the star @xcite .",
    "similar to the well - resolved two - belt systems ( hr 8799 , vega , fomalhaut and @xmath69 eri ) , the large gap between the warm and cold excesses might host multiple planets .",
    "we can constrain possible planet configurations of the hd 95086 system based on two dynamical considerations : ( 1 ) multiple planets must be dynamically stable for a time span of the age of the hd 95086 system , @xmath220 myr , and ( 2 ) the planets gravitational perturbations must clear and maintain the gap between the warm and cold belts . for the former , we make use of the numerical results of @xcite on the stability of multiple planet systems in coplanar configurations of roughly geometrically spaced orbits . for the latter we make use of numerical estimates of a planet s chaotic zone in which debris can be cleared and a gap can be maintained by each planet .",
    "the chaotic zone is owed to the overlap of first order mean motion resonances , as shown by @xcite , who estimated the chaotic zone width as @xmath108 , where @xmath109 , and @xmath110 are the planet s mass and orbital semi - major axis . in this zone , initially circular test particle orbits exhibit strongly chaotic motion .",

    "the eccentricity of the debris belts are undetermined from the current observations ; therefore , it can not be ruled out that hd 95086b on an eccentric orbit may be the cause of the large gap between the warm and cold belts .",

    "we then ask if this three - planet configuration is dynamically stable for a time span of @xmath220 myr , which is about @xmath151 orbital periods of the innermost planet . referring to the pertinent numerical study of @xcite who investigated dynamical stability of multiple planets in coplanar low eccentricity orbits of equal fractional separations , we find that @xmath152 exceeds by a comfortable margin the minimum value , @xmath153 for @xmath154 , required for dynamical stability for a time span of @xmath151 orbital periods of the innermost planet .",

    "thus , within the observational uncertainties , we consider that this configuration of three equal - mass planets , each of mass @xmath155 , in low eccentricity orbits of semi major axes @xmath212 au , 26 au and 56 au , is stable for the age of the system and can also ( marginally ) account for the entire gap between the warm and cold belts .",
    "this three - planet configuration is illustrated in figure 9 as `` system c '' .",
    "we note that three planets of much smaller mass ( or of vanishingly small orbital eccentricities ) would be less likely to meet the observational constraint of maintaining the large gap .",

    "we designate the four planets with index 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 in order of increasing astro - centric distance .",

    "thus , our putative four planet configuration is likely just marginally stable for the age of the system .",
    "we then ask if this orbital configuration may account for the entire 880 au gap . by construction , planet 1 and",
    "planet b shepherd the edges of the warm and cold belts , respectively . we calculate that , for circular planetary orbits , the exterior chaotic zone of planet 1 extends to @xmath213 au , the interior chaotic zone of planet 2 extends to @xmath214 au , the exterior chaotic zone of planet 2 extends to @xmath224 au , the interior chaotic zone of planet 3 extends to @xmath226 au , the exterior chaotic zone of planet 3 extends to @xmath244 au .",
    "thus , within the observational and theoretical uncertainties , we consider that this configuration of four equal - mass planets , each of mass 5 @xmath0 , in nearly circular orbits of semi - major axes 11 au , 19 au , 34 au and 62 au , can account for the entire gap between the warm and cold belts , and is also just marginally stable for the age of the system .",
    "this four - planet configuration is illustrated in figure 9 as `` system d '' .",
    "we note that a four - planet system is unlikely to be stable if the planet masses exceed @xmath25 @xmath0 .",

    "higher mass , coplanar planetary configurations of four planets in hd 95086 could be stable if the orbital parameters were fine - tuned to involve mean motion resonances .    for the directly - imaged four - planet system of hr 8799 , a massive cold debris disk exceeding 10% of the outermost planet s mass has been suggested to stabilize otherwise unstable configurations for several myr @xcite . in the case of hd 95086 ,",
    "the mass of the cold debris belt in particles up to 1 mm size is @xmath20.2 @xmath167 ; extrapolating to km - size bodies using a @xmath1683.5 size power - law yields a total cold disk mass of @xmath2200 @xmath167 .",
    "if this debris disk mass estimate is robust , the cold disk might play a role in stabilizing a dynamically packed planetary system with multiple massive planets similar to that of hr 8799 .",
    "we present a detailed study of the debris disk around hd 95086 , a young star that also harbors a directly imaged planet .",
    "we find :    1 . )",
    "the observed disk sed of hd 95086 is best described with two dust temperatures : a warm component at @xmath2175 k and a cold component at @xmath255 k. there is a possible hotter , but much fainter component at @xmath2300 k , suggesting the presence of debris in the terrestrial planet zone that needs future confirmation .    2 .",
    ") we detect an emission feature in the low - resolution mips - sed data .",
    "the feature peaks at 69.5@xmath50.5 @xmath1 , and is not spectrally resolved .",
    "its integrated luminosity and peak wavelength are consistent with a mineralogical feature originating from iron - poor , crystalline olivine that has been detected in many protoplanetary disks and in the @xmath4 pic debris disk .",
    "hd 95086 is the second debris disk , after @xmath4 pic , to show a feature .",
    "we estimate the mass of crystalline grains to be @xmath26.2@xmath810@xmath169 g , accounting for @xmath25% abundance in the observed dust debris .",
    "because of the high temperature of crystallization , the substantial mass required to produce this feature must have been transported from regions close to the star , or heated in the core of a planetary body that have been disrupted .",
    "the latter is consistent with the fact that this feature only detected in dustiest systems in young debris disks where collisional rates are high .    3 .",
    ") detailed analysis of the far - infrared resolved images suggests the debris emission can be traced up to radii of @xmath29  ( 800 au ) where @xmath2half of the emission is within the beam size ( radii @xmath22250 au ) and not resolved .",
    "our sed models suggest that the cold component has an outer boundary ( radius ) less than 200 au , contradicting our imaging analysis . to reconcile the sed models and the extended emission , a third component in the sed models",
    "is needed .",
    "the extended third component is likely to be a disk halo , similar to the ones that have been found in vega and hr 8799 @xcite , made of grains closer to or smaller than the blowout size that stellar radiation pressure places them in highly eccentric or hyperbolic orbits .",
    "we confirm previous determinations that the resolved structure is at an inclination of 25@xmath55  and a position angle of 115@xmath510 , and find that the eccentricity of the disk halo is small , @xmath1380.3 .    4 .",
    ") we compare the derived properties of the three components in hd 95086 to those of hr 8799 @xcite , and find a striking similarity in debris structures .",
    "both systems possess warm and cold excesses with an orbital ratio of @xmath210 , similar to the ratios between asteroid and kuiper belts in our solar system and some extrasolar debris disks @xcite .",
    "most importantly , both hd 95086 and hr 8799 systems also possess a bright disk halo , suggesting an elevated level of activities in the leftover planetesimals .",
    "it is interesting to note that the difference in dust level ( fractional luminosity ) is @xmath210 times in both warm and cold excesses between hd 95086 and hr 8799 where hd 95086 is dustier .",
    "we explore the possible planetary configurations present in the hd 95086 system using dynamical constraints from the debris distribution and currently known 5 @xmath0 planet at a astro - centric distance of 61.5 au in coplanar cases . for the case of a single planet system , the eccentricity of hd 95086b",
    "is required to be @xmath1700.7 to maintain the large gap .",
    "although we can not rule out the single planet case , the origin of its high eccentricity requires an additional explanation . for the case of a two - planet system , the current mass limit ( 21@xmath0 at a astro - centric distance of @xmath216 au ) rules out two planets on low eccentricity ( @xmath1380.1 ) orbits",
    "; however , two 5 @xmath0 planets on modest ( @xmath1250.3 ) eccentricity orbits are marginally stable for @xmath220 myr and can maintain the large gap .",
    "we further estimate the stability of packed configurations for three and four equal - mass planets on low eccentricity ( @xmath1380.1 ) orbits . in the case of three planets ,",
    "the planets need to be as massive as 7 @xmath0 ( the maximum mass for hd 95086b ) and at semi - major axes of @xmath212 au , 26 au , and 56 au to be dynamically stable and to maintain the gap .",
    "three planets of much smaller mass would be less likely to maintain the large gap .",
    "we also show that the hd 95086 system could host four low - eccentricity , massive planets between its warm and cold belts , similar to the iconic hr 8799 system ; however , barring fine - tuning with mean motion resonances , these four planets would have masses @xmath225 @xmath0 in order to be stable over the system s age ( @xmath220 myr ) .",
    "finally , our results also illustrate resolved imaging ( even marginally resolved in this case ) can provide much more insight if accompanied by proper sed modeling .",
    "since both hd 95086 and hr 8799 systems are in the epoch when active dynamical processes like final settling of giant planet migration and terrestrial planet formation are in play , the observed difference in the dust level probably reflects the age difference , i.e. , hd 95086 is a younger analog of hr 8799 , rather than initial conditions .",
    "future higher sensitivity data in the properties of the debris components will provide a better time resolution in this active planet formation epoch . among the currently known 9",
    "directly imaged extrasolar planets pic : @xcite , hd 95086 b : @xcite , gj 504 b : @xcite , hd 106906 b : @xcite . ]",
    "( masses less than 13 @xmath0 ) , the host stars also possess bright debris disks except for gj 504 , implying a strong connection between bright debris disks and directly imaged planets .",
    "the demography of planetary systems revealed by indirect methods ( radial velocity , transit , micro - lensing and presence of debris ) suggests the formation and evolution of planetary systems have multiple paths .",
    "therefore , finding common features among planetary systems is the first step to better understand their formation and evolution .",
