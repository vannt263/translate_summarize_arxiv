    "molecular electronic devices have been increasingly attracting attention from researchers working on both top down and bottom up approaches .",
    "@xcite among various molecular candidates , dna has the attractive features of recognition and self - assembly .",
    "@xcite many efforts @xcite have been devoted to understanding the mechanism of charge transfer and transport in dna . from an electrical device perspective , double barrier resonant tunneling structures , @xcite spin specific electron conductor , @xcite field effect transistor , @xcite trinary logic , @xcite optomechanical molecular motor , @xcite negative differential resistance , @xcite detection of lesions by repair proteins @xcite and doping @xcite are in principle possible with dna .",
    "furthermore , recent work has also shown that it is possible to detect diseases by measuring the electrical conductivity of dna .",
    "@xcite researchers have also found that dna can either be an insulator , @xcite a semiconductor , @xcite an ohmic conductor , @xcite or a superconductor , @xcite depending on a variety of conditions .",
    "it is broadly agreed upon that while the understanding of the electrical conductance of dna has matured over the last two decades , explaining experiments or making predictions remains a challenge , compared to nanoengineered materials such as nanotubes and nanowires that have comparable dimensions .",
    "modeling of the conductivity of a dna molecule in solution is complex because many factors contribute to the charge transport process . in wet dna ,",
    "water molecules are critical in influencing the molecular structure and hence the electronic properties .",
    "a - dna usually has five to ten water molecules per base , while for b - dna more than thirteen water molecules per base are preferred .",
    "@xcite at different hydration levels , different local densities of states ( dos ) are obtained .",
    "@xcite besides , because the backbone of a dna molecule is negatively charged in its phosphate groups , it is believed that the molecule is surrounded by cations such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "previous studies have shown that variations in cation position @xcite and type @xcite can modulate the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) levels .",
    "configuration changes ( lattice vibrations / deformation ) can also modify the conductivity of dna molecules .",
    "theoretical calculations have confirmed that changes in the distance and the angle between consecutive bases can cause variability in conduction channels by influencing the hybridization between the @xmath8 orbitals of adjacent bases .",
    "@xcite additionally , the length and sequence play an important role in determining the conductivity of dna .",
    "the sequence is important @xcite because of the different ionization potential of the four bases , adenine ( @xmath9 ) , thymine ( @xmath10 ) , guanine ( @xmath11 ) and cytosine ( @xmath12 ) and sequence dependent conduction .",
    "@xcite    the conductivity of dna molecules lying between two metal contacts has been studied by a few different groups .",
    "references have examined the conductance of dna molecules whose coordinates are frozen based on the landauer - b@xmath13ttiker formalism .",
    "their approaches can be classified into two categories , the first of which uses density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "@xcite because dft calculation for long dna strands is very time - consuming , researchers alternatively first carry dft calculations on short strands ( typically two to five base pairs ) , and extract the hamiltonian and overlap matrices for the bases and their interactions with neighbors .",
    "one can then construct a larger matrix corresponding to the hamiltonian for a longer strand from the sub - hamiltonians obtained from the mentioned calculations on shorter strands .",
    "another category is to use more simplified hamiltonians that account for only one or two energy levels on each base and their interactions with energy levels in neighboring bases.@xcite    the modeling of conductance in wet - dna lying between metal contacts is a more difficult problem because the surrounding environment ( water molecules , ions and conformation ) fluctuates with time . in this case",
    "recent work by ref . uses a combination of qm / mm to evaluate the role of fluctuating environment on dna transport .",
    "these calculations freeze the location of the atoms at each sampling point in the md simulation and calculate the phase - coherent conductance using the landauer - buttiker approach .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned work that uses the landauer - buttiker approach , there has also been work that model dna using a rate equation involving hopping and tunneling depending on the sequence involved .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we study the conductance of dry dna by carefully investigating the role of decoherence .",
    "decoherence in dry dna molecule mainly arises from time - dependent fluctuations where the electrons will lose phase information to the environment .",
    "electrons in dry dna can lose phase information by interacting with lattice vibrations and ambient electromagnetic fields .",
    "in this paper , we model the decoherence using the phenomenological b@xmath13ttiker probes .",
    "@xcite we do this in the context of four different dry dna strands considered in the experiments of ref . and shown in fig .",
    "[ sequences ] .",
    "the four strands , which will be further discussed in section ii , contain zero , one , three and five @xmath3 base pairs in the middle part of a strand that otherwise consists of only @xmath2 base pairs .",
    "we note that the method of including decoherence is not unique .",
    "four perceptive recent papers include the effect of decoherence in wet - dna using completely different approaches .",
    "@xcite reference represents the influence of atomic charges from the dna backbone , water molecules and counterions with an empirical force field using a hybrid quantum mechanics - molecular mechanics ( qm / mm ) framework .",
    "reference uses a new statistical decoherence model developed by their group .",
    "references and use the harmonic phonon bath to describe the dissipative environment .",
    "reference includes the effect of energetic vibronic coupling via a full - fledged nonequilibrium green s function approach . in our approach",
    "the dna strands are fixed and charge transport in dna is a decoherent process . a self - energy is used to represent the decoherence .",
    "a similar approach has been adopted by ref . with a simplified model hamiltonian . in our calculation",

    "we first study the phase - coherent conductance of the four strands both with and without the backbone and find that the phase - coherent conductance is many orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental values of the conductance .",
    "we then include decoherence in these strands to understand how decoherence changes the conductance .",
    "we show that by using two different decoherence rates one can provide reasonable agreement with experiments . finally , we make a brief conclusion in sec .",
    "we consider four different dna strands , in which the five base pairs in the center part are changed from @xmath2 to @xmath3 [ fig . [ sequences ] ] .",
    "the choice of our model system is motivated by the experiment in ref . , which provides data for the room temperature conductance of these four different strands under similar conditions , where the strands are connected to electrical contacts via thiol groups .",
    "the four strands we study consist of the following 15-base pair double - stranded dna molecules : @xmath14 [ fig .",
    "[ sequences ] ] .",
    "conductances of these strands were measured in ref . under dry condition .",
    "the polycation spermidine was used to stabilize the double - stranded dna molecules . in these systems , both the base pairing and base stacking of b - dna is expected to remain unaffected .",
    "@xcite    our method involves the following five steps .",
    "first , we obtain the atomic coordinates for the double - stranded b - dna using the nucleic acid builder ( nab ) software package .",
    "@xcite to study the effect of the backbone , we consider two types of strands - the native ones with the backbones and the ones whose backbones are replaced with the hydrogen atoms .",
    "the sketch of the latter case is shown in fig .",

    "second , we use gaussian 09 @xcite to obtain the hamiltonian and overlap matrices , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where the b3lyp functional and the 6 - 31 g basis set @xcite are adopted .",
    "we then transform the system to an orthogonal basis using l@xmath17ewdin transformation , @xcite @xmath18 @xmath19 in eq .",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 is a block diagonal matrix . to obtain @xmath21 ,",
    "we first diagonalize every diagonal sub - block of @xmath22 and then arrange the eigenvectors in the order of dna bases .",
    "while the diagonal blocks of @xmath15 are full matrices , the diagonal blocks of @xmath23 are diagonal matrices and the dimension of the diagonal block matrices is equal to the number of orbitals used to represent that base .",
    "physically , the diagonal blocks of @xmath23 correspond to the localized energy levels of each dna base and off - diagonal blocks correspond to interactions between different bases .",
    "if we look at the values of the off - diagonal elements , we find that the interaction corresponding to energy levels at the two nearby bases is large while that corresponding to two far away bases is relatively small .",
    "the transmission through the molecule is computed using the green s function approach , @xcite with the b@xmath13ttiker probes to account for the decoherence .",
    "we calculate the retarded green s function , which is defined by , @xmath24 g^{r}=i\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the hamiltonian shown in eq . @xmath20 .",
    "the self - energy of the left ( right ) contact @xmath25 represents the coupling of the dna to left ( right ) contact through which charge enters and leaves the dna .",
    "the self - energy due to the phase - breaking b@xmath13ttiker probes is @xmath26 .",
    "the self - energy due to the contacts is the third step of our calculations .",

    "are required though some progress has been made recently in this area .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we neglect the real part of the self - energy and further set @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is treated as an energy independent parameter",

    "this approximation has been adopted by other researchers in dna transport , @xcite especially at small biases as long as the value of @xmath36 is close to experiments .",

    "we attach the b@xmath13ttiker probes to the energy levels of the bases that correspond to the diagonal elements of @xmath23 .",

    "here we have considered a variety of values to lend some insight into the ones which may be experimentally feasible . in the process of modeling decoherence , we have also found that it is possible to explain the experiments only if we assume that there is also decoherence in the @xmath3 barriers .",

    "that is , the qualitative trend of the conductance variation for the four sequences matches well with the experiments ( conductance decreases from seq . 1 to seq .",
    "4 ) . more importantly , in contrast to the phase coherent results in fig .",
    "[ nodecoherence ] , where the conductance values are orders of magnitude smaller than the experiments , the conductance values in fig .",
    "[ decoherencegcat ] are now comparable to the experiments .",
    "this qualitative match holds well irrespective of the fermi energy as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ decoherencegcat ] .",
    "although for seq .",
    "4 , the computed conductance is about 2 times larger than the experimental result around the homo level , we still think that the fitting is good because of the uncertain factors in the experiments .",
    "decoherence on @xmath2 and @xmath94 decoherence on @xmath3 .",
    "the conductance has been increased effectively .",
    "the conductance values for the 4 strands around their homo levels are quantatively comparable to the experimental results , demonstrating the importance of adding decoherence on both @xmath2 base pairs and @xmath3 barrier.,width=288 ]    these results indicate that the decoherence is important in experiments involving dry dna , and this might be one of the reasons why the theory has difficulty in explaining experiments .    recently , there have been proposals to calculate the conductance of dna by calculating the phase coherent conductance for many points ( each of which provides a static set of distinct coordinates ) along the trajectory of and md simulation and averaging the coherently calculated conductance .",
    "@xcite these coordinates include the effect of time varying ions and water molecules , apart from thermally induced lattice vibrations",
    ". it would be interesting to compare results from the two methods for the case of dry dna to see if one can match experiments on the linear response conductance and current - voltage characteristics . to start with one",
    "could compare the average dos obtained by the two methods . also , work in ref . calculates the phase coherent conductance of dna for many realizations of coordinates obtained from md calculations of dna in water .",
    "such a process may give rise to an effective broadening of energy levels .",
    "in summary , we have modeled the zero - bias conductance of dry dna using a combination of density functional theory and the phenomenological b@xmath13ttiker probes to account for decoherence .",
    "we first explore the effect of the backbone in charge transport by comparing the coherent transmission for strands with backbones and strands whose backbones have been deleted .",
    "we find that the dna backbone can affect the coherent transmission significantly at some energy points .",
    "however , the overall shapes of the transmission are similar for the strands with backbones and strands without backbones .",
    "more interestingly , we find that the calculated conductance using phase coherent transport is orders of magnitude smaller than experiments , and that including the effect of decoherence on @xmath2 is crucial because it broadens the energy levels of dna and significantly enhances the conductance . by comparing with experiments , we find that quite a large decoherence is required even on the @xmath3 base pairs , even though they behave as barriers in the energy ranges of importance .",
    "it is also worth noting that for the @xmath2 rich strands ( strands which contain one @xmath3 base pair ) , the decoherence on @xmath2 base pairs is more important than that on @xmath3 base pairs , while for the strands contain three or five @xmath3 base pairs , the decoherence on @xmath3 plays a more significant role . by analyzing the four different dna strands",
    ", it has been determined that the decoherence strength due to b@xmath13ttiker probes is approximately 6 mev for @xmath2 base pairs and 1.5 mev for @xmath3 base pairs .",
    "while the phenomenological b@xmath13ttiker probes is able to explain the experiments qualitatively at low biases , a more accurate description of vibronic coupling would be necessary to explain experiments at large biases .",
    "this is a significantly more difficult problem requiring knowledge of both the vibronic modes and the coupling strength in dna , which is well beyond the extent of this work .",
    "we acknowledge extensive discussions with professor david janes on experimental measurements of conductivtiy in dry dna .",
