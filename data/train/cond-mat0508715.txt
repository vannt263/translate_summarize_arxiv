    "the recent growing interest in terahertz ( thz ) science and technology is due to its many important applications in physics , astronomy , chemistry , biology , and medicine , including thz imaging , spectroscopy , tomography , medical diagnosis , health monitoring , environmental control , as well as chemical and biological identification  @xcite .",
    "this range of the electromagnetic spectrum sits between 0.3 and 30 thz , which corresponds to 1000 - 10 @xmath1 m ( wavelength ) , 1.25 - 125mev ( energy ) or 14 - 1400 k ( temperature ) .",
    "the thz gap , that is still hardly reachable for both electronic and optical devices , covers temperatures of biological processes and a substantial fraction of the luminosity remanent from the big bang  @xcite .",
    "high - temperature @xmath2 superconductors have a layered structure that allows the propagation of electromagnetic waves ( called josephson plasma oscillations  @xcite ) with josephson plasma frequency @xmath3 .",
    "this is drastically different from the strong damping of electromagnetic waves in low temperature superconductors .",
    "the josephson plasma frequency lies in the thz range ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , tunable filters of thz radiation have been proposed using the josephson vortex lattice as a tunable photonic crystal @xcite .",
    "moreover , detectors of thz radiation have been very recently proposed using surface josephson plasma waves @xcite . a possible way to generate",
    "thz radiation in @xmath4 and related compounds is to apply an in - plane magnetic field @xmath5 and an external current @xmath6 perpendicular to the superconducting layers ( i.e. , along the @xmath7-axis ) .",
    "josephson vortices ( jvs ) induced by @xmath5 and driven fast by the * c*-axis current emit thz radiation ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , it was shown  @xcite that the radiation propagates _ only _ along the plane of motion of the jvs and decays in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "this thz radiation is characterized by a huge impedance mismatch resulting in a very small fraction of thz wave intensity emitted from the sample  @xcite .",
    "this impedance mismatch is a very important problem restricting possible applications  @xcite .    to avoid this problem",
    ", we propose a new class of thz emitters based on jvs moving through in - plane modulated layered superconductors , including both the strongly anisotropic high-@xmath8 @xmath2 single crystals and artificial stacks of josephson junctions ( sjj ) , e.g. , nb - al - alo@xmath9-nb . in - plane spatial variations of the josephson maximum * c*-axis current @xmath10 can be obtained by using either irradiation of a standard @xmath2 sample covered by a modulated mask ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) or pancake vortices controlled by an out - of - plane magnetic field  @xcite .    in order to pass through the superconductor - vacuum interface without a significant decrease of the amplitude ,",
    "the electric and magnetic components of the propagating wave have to be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this feature is inherent for the out - of - plane josephson plasma waves ( jpw ) , propagating both along and perpendicular to the layers with short wavelength along the @xmath7-axis . for such waves ,",
    "the transmission coefficient is about unity @xcite .",
    "the out - of - plane jpw can be emitted , for instance , by a fast moving josephson vortex if its velocity @xmath11 exceeds a certain threshold value @xmath12 .",
    "however , this out - of - plane cherenkov - type radiation always completely reflects from the sample boundary and thus can not be emitted into the vacuum .",
    "indeed , the longitudinal wave vector @xmath13 for the cherenkov radiation is related to the wave frequency @xmath14 by @xmath15 and is much larger than the maximum possible value @xmath16 for waves in vacuum .",
    "this problem can be solved if the out - of - plane cherenkov radiation propagates through a modulated layered superconductor .",
    "the out - of - plane cherenkov wave interacting with periodic inhomogeneities generates new modes with wave vectors @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the spatial period of the modulations and @xmath19 is an integer .",
    "thus , the wave vector @xmath20 can meet the condition @xmath21 for vacuum waves and is emitted from a sample without an impedance mismatch .",
    "it is important to stress that the cherenkov radiation generated by any relativistic particle in any medium undergoes a complete internal reflection ( since @xmath22 ) and , thus , we propose this general way of emitting any cherenkov - type radiation to vacuum . here",
    ", we predict this out - of - plane cherenkov radiation , and derive the modes propagating in a modulated superconductor and emitted into the vacuum .",
    "our proposal mainly concerns bulk layered superconductors , where it is important to have radiation propagating not only along the @xmath23-planes , but also along the @xmath7-axis . for the case of thin films having a thickness much smaller than the in - plane london penetration depth ( about 200 nm ) ,",
    "the radiation damped along the @xmath7-axis can also give some contribution to the waves emitted from the wide sample side , which is parallel to the @xmath23-plane .",
    "this can even increase the fraction of the out - of - plane radiation discussed in this paper .",
    "in other words , we show that there are two contributions to the out - of - plane radiation along the @xmath7-axis : damped waves and propagating waves .",
    "the latter one is the real out - of - plane radiation .",
    "the former one ( damped waves ) can contribute to the out - of - plane radiation only if the sample is sufficiently thin .",
    "however , we will not consider this case in detail because the power of the emitted radiation decreases for decreasing thickness .      for electromagnetic waves in any conducting media , the electric field",
    "@xmath24 is very weak with respect to the magnetic field @xmath25 : @xmath26 . also , for in - plane radiation : @xmath26 .",
    "thus , only a small fraction ( @xmath27 ) of the radiation can leave the sample .",
    "this is the so - called `` impedance mismatch '' problem that has severely limited progress in this field for years .",
    "now , we are also considering @xmath7-axis short - wavelength out - of - plane radiation .",
    "this radiation has a strong enough in - plane electric field @xmath28 to overcome the superconducting  vacuum interface .",
    "indeed , @xmath28 and the magnetic field both are of the same order of magnitude , similar to the one for waves propagating in the vacuum .",
    "this solves the impedance mismatch problem .",
    "thus , we propose to use @xmath7-axis short - wavelength out - of - plane radiation , propagating in a _ periodically modulated _",
    "bi@xmath29sr@xmath29cacu@xmath29o@xmath30 sample , to _ overcome _ the severe _ impedance mismatch problem _ which limits the application of layered superconductors for thz emitters .",
    "the spatial modulations of the maximum josephson current allows the emitted waves to shift their wavenumbers ( within a wide range @xmath31 ) towards the narrow spectral window @xmath32 for waves propagating in the vacuum .",
    "thus , the emitted waves can pass the superconductor - vacuum interface within a narrow frequency window @xmath33 .",
    "this offers the possibility to select a narrow frequency window from the initially - broad thz radiation produced by the jvs .",
    "also , this should allow to achieve superradiance via the stabilization of the square josephson lattice moving in a periodically modulated @xmath4 samples@xcite .",
    "other recent novel ways to control vortex motion are also attracting considerable attention @xcite .",
    "we consider an infinite layered superconductor as in fig .",
    "1b . following @xcite , we assume that the superconducting layers are extremely thin , so that the spatial variations of the phase of the superconducting order parameter and the electromagnetic field inside the layers in the direction perpendicular to the layers can be neglected .",
    "we choose the @xmath34-plane to be parallel to the crystallographic @xmath23-plane and the @xmath7-axis along the @xmath35-axis .",
    "superconducting layers are numbered by the subscript @xmath36 .",
    "the electric @xmath37 and magnetic @xmath38 fields have components , @xmath39 .",
    "the gauge - invariant phase difference @xmath40 between @xmath41th and @xmath36th superconducting layers is described by coupled sine - gordon equations  @xcite , @xmath42 @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the spatial period of the layered structure , @xmath45 is the london penetration depth along the @xmath7-axis , the operator @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the josephson frequency , @xmath49 is the interlayer dielectric constant , and the modulation factor @xmath50 is a periodic function with spatial period @xmath18 . for simplicity , we neglect the relaxation term related to the quasiparticle current , which is very small at low temperatures .",
    "the coupled sine - gordon equations ( [ e12 ] ) describe both the josephson vortices in layered superconductors and the emitted josephson plasma waves . in the last case eq .",

    "( [ e12 ] ) , @xmath52 , represents the jv moving with a constant velocity .",
    "the main phase difference @xmath53 occurs at the central junction , where nonlinearity plays a crucial role , while equations for junctions with @xmath54 can be linearized .",
    "however , the magnetic flux of a jv spreads over a large number of these junctions , @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the equation for the central junction can not be decoupled from others .",
    "this determines a complicated non - local structure of the jv in layered superconductors .    following the approach by gurevich  @xcite ,",
    "the closed - form non - local sine - gordon equation for @xmath56 can be derived ( see appendix ) , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the modified bessel function , @xmath59 is the josephson length , @xmath60 is the penetration depth of the magnetic field along layers , and @xmath61 is the flux quantum . strictly speaking , equation  ( [ 17 ] )",
    "is derived for a jv moving in a weaker junction with a critical current @xmath62 but describes qualitatively even the stack of identical junctions ( see appendix ) .",
    "equation  ( [ 17 ] ) is reduced to the usual local sine - gordon equation only for @xmath63 , i.e. , if the kernel @xmath64 in the integral in eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) is a sharper function of @xmath65 than @xmath66 . for @xmath4 as well as for artificial layered superconductors , the opposite strongly non - local limit , @xmath67 , is realized . in this case , a soliton - like solution , @xmath68 of eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for a fixed jv , @xmath69 , with the soliton size @xmath70 it is important to stress that the soliton size @xmath71 ( rather than @xmath72 ) coincides with the well - known estimate of the jv core ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) in a layered superconductor .",
    "analytical and numerical analysis proves that the size @xmath75 of the moving jv remains of the same order at any allowed vortex velocities @xmath76 note that , due to non - locality , the maximum vortex velocity @xmath77 in a layered superconductor is much smaller than the maximum vortex velocity @xmath78 ( so - called swihart velocity ) in a single junction @xcite .",

    "<S> we show that a moving josephson vortex in spatially modulated layered superconductors generates out - of - plane thz radiation . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the magnetic and in - plane electric fields radiated are of the same order , which is very unusual for any good - conducting medium . therefore , the out - of - plane radiation can be emitted to the vacuum without the standard impedance mismatch problem . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the proposed design can be more efficient for tunable thz emitters than previous proposals , for radiation only propagating along the @xmath0-plane . </S>"
