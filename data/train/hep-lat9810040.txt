    "high statistics experimental studies of @xmath1 mesons , such as e831 ( focus ) and e791 , are expected to yield @xmath2 fully reconstructed @xmath1 decays with better momentum resolution than preceding experiments@xcite . anticipating high precision experimental results ,",
    "we consider how well the ckm ratio @xmath0 can be determined from a ratio of @xmath3 to @xmath4 decay rates and lattice qcd .",
    "for the cabibbo allowed @xmath4 decay , lower statistics and poorer resolutions in earlier experiments meant hadronic matrix elements could be described by functions of only two parameters : the ckm matrix element times a form factor at zero momentum transfer and the pole mass in a pole dominance _ ansatz_. the pdg quotes a @xmath5 error for @xmath6 based upon such techniques@xcite .",
    "the uncertainty due to this _ ansatz _ is difficult to quantify .",
    "they quote a @xmath7 uncertainty in the theoretical determination of @xmath8 resulting in a @xmath9 uncertainty for @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is determined with an error of @xmath12 from @xmath13-@xmath14 production of charm off of valence @xmath15 quarks@xcite . combining this uncertainty and that for @xmath10 we deduce an error of about @xmath16 in the current best value of @xmath0 .",
    "we examine uncertainties in determining @xmath0 directly from a ratio of semileptonic decay rates .",
    "we expect that both experimental and theoretical systematic errors common to @xmath4 and @xmath3 will be reduced in ratios .",
    "we suggest the ratio of ckm matrix elements can be determined by a double ratio @xmath17 the maximum recoil momentum cut , @xmath18 , will be adjusted to minimize combined experimental and theoretical errors@xcite .",
    "the ratio of partial widths @xmath19 is to be determined experimentally .",
    "@xmath20 is provided by theory calculation . in the @xmath1-meson rest frame ,",
    "@xmath21 where hadronic matrix elements are expressed conveniently by form factors @xmath22 .",

    "we obtain @xmath27-improved matrix elements using the fermilab interpretation for heavy quarks and tree - level @xmath28-improved currents@xcite .",
    "note that the vector current renormalization factor cancels in ratio @xmath29 .",
    "we have computed three - point correlators at @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we determine the lattice spacing , @xmath33 , using the charmonium @xmath34-@xmath35 splitting and the bare charm mass using the spin - averaged @xmath35 charmonium kinetic mass .",
    "the same gauge - field ensembles and procedures were used to study @xmath36 and @xmath1 meson decay constants@xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite describes our @xmath37 results on these lattices and provides more details on our three - point function calculations .    for illustration , and to reduce some known systematic errors , we take @xmath38 . for this preliminary study",
    "we take our best estimate for matrix elements from @xmath30 .",
    "we approximate the @xmath4 decay by @xmath39 where a pseudoscalar `` @xmath40 '' meson consists of @xmath41 and @xmath42 valence quarks .",
    "we denote the ratio in for the @xmath43 decay by @xmath44 .",
    "the analysis for @xmath4 is underway .    in",
    "we show differential decay rates for @xmath30 .",
    "the ratio of areas for @xmath38 gives @xmath45 where the error is statistical .",
    "systematic errors are the subject of the rest of the paper .",
    "we use all three lattices to study the cutoff dependence of @xmath39 matrix elements .",
    "we compare partial widths at @xmath30 to partial widths computed from @xmath46 extrapolated to the continuum linearly with the lattice spacing .",
    "matrix elements @xmath47 for a given @xmath48 on each lattice were found by interpolating among @xmath46 values calculated for discrete values of @xmath48 .",
    "discretization errors in the width increase with @xmath48 , as expected , reaching @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "momentum dependent errors of this magnitude were anticipated by errors estimates for free - field tree - level quark matrix elements@xcite .",
    "errors for the pion width are expected to be similar to those for the @xmath51 width .",
    "these errors , however , will tend to cancel in ratios . hence we estimate residual cutoff errors are below @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "our bare charm masses were determined in quarkonia .",
    "charm masses determined using heavy - light mesons differ due to discretization errors and the quenched approximation .",
    "we find at most a @xmath52 difference in bare @xmath54 comparing the two methods .",
    "figure  [ fig : mqscaling ] , which compares @xmath55 calculated for @xmath43 and @xmath56 mesons , shows that @xmath57 corrections are small in this case@xcite .",
    "numerical results and pole dominance arguments indicate that @xmath58 has somewhat more @xmath57 dependence than @xmath46 .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in adjusting @xmath54 leads to a @xmath59 error in @xmath44 .",
    "the quenched approximation leads to systematic differences in lattice spacing determinations .",

    "this almost certainly underestimates the error due to quenching .",
    "correlators are computed for light quark masses between about @xmath61 to @xmath62 times @xmath63 . for lighter masses ,",
    "correlators begin to show increasing fluctuations caused by nearby unphysical dirac operator zero - modes found on a small subset of our gauge configurations .",
    "hence we must obtain matrix elements for up and down quarks by `` chiral '' extrapolations of matrix elements computed for masses close to the strange quark .",
    "near zero recoil momentum these extrapolations are more difficult because matrix elements are sensitive to the light quark mass",
    ". this can be understood as the effect of nearby poles in a pole dominance picture .",
    "the effect upon @xmath44 is small , however , since the decay rate is kinematically suppressed by @xmath64 ( see ) .",
    "matrix elements show less dependence upon quark mass at larger recoil momenta .",
    "statistical noise increases with recoil momenta , however , making extrapolations there noisier .",
    "hence we find a `` window '' at moderate recoil momentum where chiral extrapolations are most dependable . by varying our extrapolation procedures we estimate chiral extrapolations contribute a @xmath52 error to @xmath53 .",
    "if correlators could be reliably computed for masses significantly below @xmath63 our chiral extrapolation uncertainties would decrease .",
    "the modified quenched approximation shows promise in this respect@xcite .",

    "smaller @xmath33 will result in smaller cutoff effects than our @xmath30 results but with similar statistical errors .",
    "the error due to the quenched approximation has yet to be fully investigated . a quenching error of @xmath70-@xmath71 would not be unexpected , however , in the deviation of @xmath29 from unity .",
    "theoretical uncertainties in @xmath0 have been estimated for our procedure with @xmath66 .",
