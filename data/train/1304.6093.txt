    "in the last few years we have begun to investigate the cosmic reionization of hydrogen by using a variety of techniques .",
    "reionization was completed between @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite , bracketed by the detection of gunn - peterson troughs in the spectra of @xmath9 quasars @xcite and by the compton optical depth measured by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ; @xcite ) . however , the nature of the sources responsible for cosmic reionization is still an open question .",
    "the uv photons expected to contribute to the reionization process come from mainly two sources , star forming galaxies and quasars .",
    "the former probably were fundamental for the hydrogen reionization , whereas the latter likely dominated the helium reionization @xcite .",
    "accreting black holes in the redshift range between @xmath10 and @xmath11 are rare and possibly obscured by significant amounts of gas and dust , so their uv emission probably does not contribute significantly to the reionization process @xcite . according to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , @xmath12",
    "quasars are not able to provide enough ionizing photons to contribute significantly to reionization .",
    "population iii stars are also unlikely to dominate the ionizing uv production . in the standard scenario , in which only a single metal free star per dark halo is formed",
    ", the contribution to reionization given by population iii stars is only indirect .",
    "in fact , while the cumulative number of ionizing photons produced by them is not enough , they enrich the intergalactic medium of metals and allow the more efficient formation of following generations of population ii stars @xcite .",
    "these stars are likely located in faint galaxies @xcite .",
    "a large optical depth to electron scattering , consistent with the universe being reionized at @xmath13 , was found by wmap @xcite .",
    "since there are still strong uncertainties on several key parameters concerning reionization , @xcite stated that it is not clear if galaxies could have completed the reionization by @xmath0 and account for the large optical depth to electron scattering found by wmap-7 . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the studies carried out in the last decade are focused on the critical star formation rate density ( sfrd ) .",
    "the lyman break galaxies detected at @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite in the hubble ultra deep field ( hereafter hudf ) are not bright enough to account for the required ionizing budget .",
    "however , more recently @xcite have found that the detected galaxies at @xmath12 are sufficient to fully reionize the igm if @xmath15 . according to @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the observed @xmath16 galaxies could have completed the reionization process if @xmath17 .",
    "the observed faint - end slopes imply large numbers of undetected faint galaxies which likely provide the bulk of ionizing photons and played an important role in cosmic reionization @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , direct probing of the faint galaxy population is outside present capabilities and will need to wait for the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) .",
    "thus , in order to make further progress in this field before the launch of jwst , one needs to find ways to study the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function at @xmath18 using the integrated light contribution of individually undetected galaxies .",
    "this idea is not new and it was tried in the context of high-@xmath19 studies using the spitzer infrared array camera ( irac ) and advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) data @xcite and is , in fact , also analogous to the study of surface brightness fluctuations of nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe a new technique to analyze the contribution of faint , individually undetected , galaxies where we indicate as undetected galaxies those galaxies characterized by being fainter than the typical signal - to - noise ( @xmath20 ) ratio of 4.5 @xcite .",
    "we focus mostly on galaxies just below the detection threshold as such galaxies are likely to exist , given that the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies should not know the hudf magnitude limit , and they might be sufficient for reionization @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are too faint to be measured individually , but their signal can be quantified using a fourier transform based technique .",
    "the main difference here over the previous attempts at high redshift is our special attention to systematic effects .",
    "the lyman break technique permits to identify star - forming galaxies at high redshift using color criteria derived from a multi - band photometry in the region across the lyman - continuum discontinuity @xcite . comparing the flux of a galaxy within a set of two or three ad - hoc filters depending on the redshift",
    ", it can be noticed that no flux is collected by the bluer filter due to the lyman @xmath21 absorption , while the object is detected in the redder bands .    in this paper",
    "we focus on @xmath4-dropout galaxies at @xmath22 that can be studied using images obtained with the same camera and characterized by , essentially , the same systematic effects .",
    "galaxies at @xmath0 are expected to be undetected in the acs f775w band ( hereafter @xmath2 ) image and detected in the acs f850lp ( hereafter @xmath3 ) one , so they are named @xmath2-dropout galaxies .",
    "the faint galaxy population we seek is detected by an excess in the power spectrum in the @xmath3 image with respect to that of the @xmath2 one , i.e. , it is a lyman break population .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the data used . in section 3",
    ", we explain the data analysis and we present the main steps of the power spectrum technique adopted to obtain the signal coming from the undetected galaxies , which are bona fide @xmath8 candidates . in section 4 , we describe how to estimate the contribution to cosmic reionization using monte carlo simulations , we discuss our results and their implications for the reionization epoch .",
    ".properties of the nicp12 data . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ chi_squared ]     and @xmath2 power spectra ( black line ) with the median derived from the simulations with a different percentage of spirals and ellipticals represented by different colors , 50% ellipticals and 50% spirals in green , 33% ellipticals and 67% spirals in red , and 15% ellipticals and 85% spirals in blue . ]     and @xmath2 power spectra ( black ) and those obtained by simulating unresolved galaxies in different magnitude ranges , i.e. , @xmath23 ( blue dashed line ) , @xmath24 ( orange dotted line ) , @xmath25 ( red dashed line ) , and @xmath26 ( green dotted line ) . ]    this mix was adopted to test the sensitivity of the method to the assumed value of the faint end limit .",
    "to this aim we performed a few simulations changing the fainter magnitude limit of the mock galaxies ( figure [ multiplot_comparison_magnitudes ] ) .",
    "we used the chi - square statistics to select the best simulation concerning the magnitude cut - off ( see columns 5 and 6 in table [ chi_squared ] ) .",
    "moreover , we computed the difference between the simulations and the data , and we plotted the residuals ( figure [ histograms_residuals ] , ( c ) panel ) . on the basis of above , we decided to create galaxies with magnitudes up to 30.5 mag .    _",
    "the mask : _ consistent results can be achieved only by analyzing the same area in data and simulations . for this reason we used , for the simulated images , the same mask created from the acs data .",
    "moreover , we considered what percentage of the frame is masked and calculated the number of mock galaxies that had to be outside the masked area .",
    "we , therefore , placed them randomly on the frame checking that they were positioned outside the mask .",
    "the sum of the simulated galaxies , the frame reproducing the large scale effects , and the random noise frames was multiplied by the mask and analyzed with the power spectrum technique .",
    "the results obtained by iterating the simulations 100 times considering the 5 bins of magnitudes given in table [ tab_num_mag ] and assuming one third of the galaxies to be ellipticals and the others spirals are shown in figure [ ratio_100sim ] .",
    "the trend of the data with the associated errors is well fitted by the mean ratio between the simulated power spectra , and all the values are in agreement with the @xmath27 confidence range .    .",
    "the filled histograms refer to the selected realization , i. e. the one with the lowest @xmath28 . ]     and @xmath3 simulated power spectra ( blue line ) and @xmath27 confidence range ( light blue region ) derived from 100 simulations compared to the results coming from the acs data ( black line ) . ]      in order to evaluate the implications for reionization of our findings , we considered the total surface brightness contribution of the undetected galaxies following the approach of @xcite .",
    "when this contribution is added to that of detected galaxies , we find a surface brightness of 24.8 mag arcmin@xmath30 when extrapolating to a magnitude @xmath31 mag and 23.6 mag arcmin@xmath30 when extrapolating to @xmath32 mag .",
    "we compared these values to the minimum surface brightness of 27.2 mag arcmin@xmath30 needed for reionization by population ii stars @xcite .",
    "our results give comfortable margins of a factor 9 and 27 , respectively , to accommodate the escape fraction @xmath33 and the clumping factor @xmath34 .",
    "for instance , assuming @xmath35 and the population ii spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of @xcite , the lf extrapolated down to @xmath32 produces enough ionizing photons to reionize the universe if @xmath36% .",
    "so far the implications for reionization of what we found seem to be very promising , but we are waiting for a more thorough analysis of all available fields before pushing this interpretation any further .",
    "in this paper we presented a new technique to quantify the light contribution coming from the faint high redshift galaxies below the detection threshold of imaging data .",
    "specifically , we illustrated the technique with an application to acs data obtained in the f775w and f850lp filters for the hudf parallel field nicp12 looking for faint @xmath0 galaxies on the basis of the lyman break technique , which is based on a comparison between the flux of a galaxy within the set of two filters .",
    "in particular , our aim was to extend by a few magnitudes the faint end of the luminosity function at that redshift .",
    "after masking all the detected sources in the field we applied a fast fourier transform to obtain the spatial power spectrum of the background signal and we examined the ratio between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 power spectra . in this way we were able to distinguish the sources of noise from the fluctuations due to the unresolved galaxies .",
    "we tested the effect of several parameters on the power spectrum to test its reliability and how contamination can affect the results .",
    "we showed that the power spectrum technique is a powerful tool in analyzing the light contribution produced by galaxies which are below the detection limit in deep and ultra deep surveys .",
    "we used this technique to estimate the contribution to cosmic reionization from faint galaxies ( @xmath37 mag ) , which are bona fide @xmath38 candidates , in the nicp12 acs field of the udf05 .",
    "monte carlo simulations were used to determine the number of faint undetected @xmath4-dropouts responsible for the peak observed in the ratio between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 power spectra ( figure [ ps_ratio ] ) .",
    "the data are consistent with a faint end slope of the luminosity function of @xmath5 if not introducing any clustering / grouping in the @xmath2-dropouts distribution , and @xmath39 when considering pairs of galaxies with distances drawn accordingly to the angular correlation function by @xcite .",
    "both the @xmath21 values we obtained are consistent with previous findings by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "considering @xmath5 , adding the total surface brightness contribution of faint galaxies to that from the detected galaxies and comparing it to the minimum value required to reionize the universe , we obtained a margin to model the escape fraction and the clumping factor . adopting the clumping factor of 6 and population ii sed of @xcite , the @xmath0 undetected galaxies down to @xmath32 mag produce enough ionizing photons to reionize the universe assuming the escape fraction to be larger than @xmath40% the solution with all galaxies in pairs and a slope @xmath39 changes the cumulative surface brightness by less than 0.1 mag and implies an escape fraction larger by @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the main conclusion of the paper that reionization is indeed consistent with being completed due to the contribution of faint galaxies is not affected by the presence of multiple halo occupation .    we expect to apply our technique to the ultra deep data obtained with nicmos and the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) .",
    "the comparison of the results for different fields and instruments will permit us to better constrain the role that faint galaxies at @xmath8 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 had in the cosmic reionization .",
