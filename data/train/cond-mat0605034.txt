    "the valence bond ( vb ) basis for singlet states of quantum spin systems was first discussed by rumer @xcite and pauling @xcite in the 1930s and was shortly thereafter applied in heisenberg spin chain calculations by hulthn.@xcite for a systems of @xmath9 @xmath0 spins the overcomplete and non - orthogonal vb basis consists of states that are products of @xmath10 spin pairs forming singlets . in the most general case",
    "the members of a singlet can be separated by an arbitrary distance , but it is often convenient to consider a restricted set of configurations with only bonds connecting two different groups of sites , e.g. , the two sublattices of a bipartite lattice . such a restricted vb basis is still overcomplete and any singlet state can be expanded in it .",
    "any restriction on the maximum length of the bonds will render the basis incomplete , however .",
    "after anderson s proposal in 1987 of a resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) state @xcite as a natural starting point for understanding high - temperature superconductivity in the cuprates,@xcite variational vb states were investigated for both doped and undoped antiferromagnets.@xcite the rvb spin liquid mechanism is based on states dominated by short valence bonds , which in the extreme case have been argued to correspond closely to the quantum dimer model.@xcite it was early on established , however , that the ground state of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) heisenberg model with nearest - neighbor interactions , which has a nel ordered ground state and describes very well the undoped cuprates,@xcite actually requires an algebraic , not exponential , decay of the bond - length probability.@xcite    some attempts were made to use the vb basis as a framework for numerical calculations , @xcite but , with very few exceptions,@xcite these efforts were not pursued further in large scale quantum monte carlo calculations ( qmc ) .",
    "however , it was recently pointed out that there are previously unnoticed advantages of carrying out ground state projector qmc calculations in the vb basis , including a natural way to access excitations in the triplet sector.@xcite such a scheme has already been applied to 2d and 3d models with valence bond solid ground states.@xcite    it may also be worthwhile to pursue further variational schemes in the vb basis , especially exploring possibilities to study frustrated systems this way . in this paper",
    "we report a bench - mark variational calculation going beyond previous vb variational studies @xcite of the 2d heisenberg model .",
    "instead of assuming a functional form for the bond - length amplitudes and optimizing a few parameters , we optimize all individual amplitudes in order to definitely establish the properties of this kind of wave function and its ability to reproduce the ground state of the 2d heisenberg model . we also report some preliminary studies of a frustrated system .    for the standard 2d heisenberg model with nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath11 ,",
    "the energy of our best optimized wave function deviates by only @xmath12 from the exact ground state energy for system with up to @xmath3 spins .",
    "the size dependence of @xmath13 shows that this accuracy should persist in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the error is only half that of the best wave functions found in the previous variational qmc study.@xcite the spin - spin correlations are also remarkably well reproduced ; they are approximately @xmath14 smaller than the exact values at long distances , corresponding to an @xmath15 underestimation of the sublattice magnetization .",
    "we find that the asymptotic form of the amplitudes for bonds of length @xmath7 is @xmath16 , which has also been found recently in a mean - field calculation .",
    "@xcite we also compare the variational wave function with the exact ground state in the case of a @xmath17 lattice , and find that the overlap is @xmath18 . extending the @xmath17 calculation to a frustrated system , the j@xmath19j@xmath20 model , we find that the quality of the amplitude - product wave function deteriorates as the frustration is increased but the overlap remains above @xmath21 even for @xmath22 as high as @xmath23 .    in sec .  ii we define the variational vb wave function .",
    "technical details of the qmc based optimization methods that we have used to minimize the energy are presented in sec .",
    "we discuss both a standard newton method and a stochastic scheme , which requires only the first derivatives of the energy .",
    "the latter method performs significantly better for large lattices .",

    "vi we conclude with a brief summary and discussion of the methods and results .",
    "we study the standard @xmath0 heisenberg model ; @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes nearest - neighbor sites on a 2d square lattice and @xmath26 .",
    "the basic properties of this model have been known for a long time,@xcite and ground state parameters such as the sublattice magnetization , the energy , and the spin stiffness have been extracted to high precision in many qmc studies.@xcite here our aim is to investigate how well a simple variational wave function can reproduce the true ground state .",
    "the general form of a vb wave function for @xmath9 @xmath0 spins is @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents a singlet formed by the spins at sites @xmath29 and @xmath30 in vb configuration @xmath31 ; @xmath32 the notation @xmath33 has been introduced in ( [ psigeneral ] ) for convenience . in the most general case",
    ", the vb configurations @xmath34 include all the possible pairings of the @xmath9 spins into @xmath10 valence bonds .",
    "a more restricted , but still massively overcomplete basis is obtained by first dividing the sites into two groups , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which in the case of a bipartite lattice naturally correspond to the two sublattices . here",
    "we will use such a restricted vb basis and always ( also when considering the frustrated case later on ) take @xmath35 and @xmath36 to refer to the sublattices of the square lattice .",
    "we fix the  direction \" of the singlet in ( [ singlet ] ) by always taking the first index in @xmath37 from @xmath35 and the second one from @xmath36 . with this convention",

    "only a few short - length amplitudes were optimized and beyond these an asymptotic form depending only on the length @xmath7 of the bond was assumed.@xcite with a power - law form , @xmath49 , it was found that long - range neel order requires @xmath50 .",
    "the best variational energy was obtained with @xmath51 , giving a deviation @xmath52 ( or @xmath53 ) from the exact ground state energy ( the thermodynamic - limit value of which is @xcite @xmath54 per site ) .",
    "we here optimize all @xmath55 using two different methods : a standard newton method ( combined with a conjugate gradient method  the fletcher reeves method@xcite ) , and a stochastic method that we have developed which requires only the signs of the first derivatives .",
    "we now discuss the technical details of these calculations . to optimize the energy using a monte carlo based scheme , we write its expectation value as @xmath56 where on the right - hand side we have taken into account the fact that we do not normalize the wave - function coefficients , i.e. , the amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ hproduct ] ) are only determined up to an over - all factor .",
    "the overlap @xmath57 between two vb states is related to the loops forming when the two bond configurations are superimposed ; @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the number of loops.@xcite matrix elements of @xmath60 are also easy to evaluate in terms of the loop structure .",
    "if @xmath47 and @xmath61 belong to the same loop , then @xmath62 @xmath63 ( @xmath64 for @xmath65 on the same sublattice and @xmath66 else ) , and else the matrix element vanishes.@xcite recently more complicated matrix elements have also been related to the loop structure.@xcite    for a given set of amplitudes @xmath1 , we evaluate the energy using the metropolis monte carlo algorithm described in ref .  .",
    "an elementary update of the bond configuration amounts to choosing two next - nearest - neighbor sites @xmath67 ( or in principle any @xmath67 in the same sublattice , but the acceptance rate decreases with increasing distance between the sites ) , and reconfiguring the bonds @xmath68 to which they are connected , according to @xmath69 ( where the order of the labels here correspond to both sites @xmath29 and @xmath70 being in sublattice a ) .",
    "the metropolis acceptance probability @xmath71 for such an update is very easy to calculate in terms of amplitude ratios and the change in the number of loops , @xmath72 , in the overlap graph ; @xmath73.\\ ] ]      for the optimization we also need derivatives of the energy with respect to the amplitudes .",
    "the newton method requires first and second derivatives . moving in a certain direction @xmath74 in amplitude space ,",
    "the amplitude vector @xmath75 is updated from iteration @xmath76 to @xmath77 according to @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the first and second derivatives of the energy along the @xmath74 direction .",
    "they are calculated from the derivatives with respect to the amplitudes @xmath1 , which are evaluated during the sampling of vb configurations .",
    "writing the energy expectation value as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the total number of vbs of size @xmath2 in the vb configurations @xmath34 and @xmath83 , the monte carlo estimator for the first derivative is @xmath84 here , to simplify the notation , we use @xmath29 as a collective index for @xmath2 . the second derivatives ",
    "the elements of the hessian matrix  are : @xmath85 since we have many amplitudes @xmath1 to optimize , we choose our optimization direction by the conjugate gradient method .",
    "the first direction is the gradient direction . in subsequent steps",
    "we choose the direction conjugate to the former one , satisfying the relation @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the hessian matrix . in practice",
    ", we have found that the number of line optimizations required for energy convergence is of the same order as total number of different amplitudes .",
    "since the optimization is based on quantities obtained using a stochastic scheme , the final results of course have statistical errors .",
    "we have @xmath88 different second derivatives and hence computing all of them requires a significant computational effort .",
    "their statistical fluctuations are also relatively large for large lattices .",
    "we have also used a minimization method requiring only the first derivatives , where the amplitudes are iterated according to @xmath89 this amplitude update , which gives the exact minimum in the quadratic regime , works well when @xmath1 are getting close to their optimum values .",
    "however , we still need the second derivatives until we get very close to the optimum and in practice the advantage of using ( [ iter1 ] ) instead of ( [ iter2 ] ) at the final stages does not appear to be significant .",
    "we here note that a method recently proposed to reduce the statistical fluctuations of the hessian in variational qmc optimizations of electronic wave functions @xcite is not applicable here .",
    "the proposal was to symmetrize the hessian and write it solely in terms of covariances , by adding terms which are zero on average but reduce the statistical fluctuations of a finite sample .",
    "however , in our case the hessian ( [ hessian1],[hessian2 ] ) is already of this form and there is nothing more to do in this regard .",
    "we have developed a completely different optimization method which turns out to work much better than the newton method .",
    "it is a stochastic scheme which only requires the signs of the first derivatives .",
    "we update each amplitude @xmath90 according to @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a random number in the range @xmath93 and @xmath94 if @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath97 . the parameter @xmath98 is gradually reduced , so that the amplitude changes become gradually smaller . if this  annealing \" is performed slowly enough the scheme converges the system to the lowest energy .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the random factor @xmath92 is not even needed ; the scheme converges even if @xmath99 . with @xmath99 ,",
    "this kind of updating scheme has in fact been introduced previously in the context of neutral networks and is known as _",
    "manhattan learning_.@xcite note that even in this case there is still in principle some randomness in the method , because when the derivatives become small the signs of their qmc estimates can be wrong due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "thus , there are occasional adjustments of amplitudes in the wrong direction .",
    "we have found that the random factor @xmath92 speeds up the convergence , especially in the initial stages of optimization , and so we normally include it .",
    "our method is also related to what is known as _",
    "stochastic optimization_,@xcite where the parameter vector is updated in a steepest - decent fashion according to the stochastically evaluated gradient ; @xmath100 this method has been used by harju _ et al._@xcite to optimize electrinic wave functions .",
    "we have tested it on the present problem but find that it performs significantly worse than our own variant of stochastic optimization .",
    "the reason appears to be that the fluctuations in the gradient can be very large , which can cause large detremental jumps in the configuration space . in our scheme",
    "the step size is bounded and we avoid such problems .    as in simulated annealing methods ,",
    "a slow enough reduction of @xmath98 should give the optimum solution .",
    "in the present case , unlike in simulated annealing , the optimum reached should only be expected to be a local optimum , although the stochastic nature of the scheme does allow for some more extensive exploration of the parameter space than with deterministic schemes . in stochastic optimization using the gradient , it has been argued that an annealing scheme of the form @xmath101 should be used in order for the method to converge .",
    "we have found this scheme with @xmath102 to work well .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether this very simple scheme could also be applied to optimize wave functions in electronic structure calculations ",
    "the time savings from not having to calculate second derivatives are potentially very significant in problems with a large number of parameters .",
    "of the variational ground state energy from the exact energy as a function of lattice size .",
    "results obtained with both the newton method and the stochastic opitimization scheme are shown .",
    "the error bars were obtained by carrying out several independent optimization runs for each @xmath103.,width=317 ]    we now discuss our results . in fig .",
    "[ ed ] we compare the ground state energy as calculated with the stochastic and newton methods .",
    "we show the deviations from the correct ground state energies ( obtained using unbiased qmc calculations @xcite ) as a function of the lattice size @xmath103 up to @xmath104 .",
    "both optimization methods give very small energy deviations for the @xmath17 system  about @xmath105but the error grows as the lattice size increases .",
    "we have calculated error bars by repeating the optimizations ( from scratch ) several times .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the fluctuations in this kind of nonlinear problem do not necessary have expectation value zero .",
    "hence error bars calculated in the standard way in general only reflect partially the actual errors .    for @xmath106",
    "the stochastic method delivers significantly lower energies , indicating that the newton method has difficulties in locating the optimum exactly .",
    "we believe that this problem is due to the statistical errors of the second derivatives ( which are much larger than those of the first derivatives ) .",
    "convergence issues related to statistical fluctuations of the hessian are well known in variational calculations for electronic systems.@xcite any systematic shifts in the newton method would of course be reduced by increasing the length of the simulation segments used to calculate the energy and its derivatives in each iteration .",
    "simulations sufficiently long to reach the same level of optimization as with the stochastic method do not appear to be practically feasible , however . in the stochastic scheme",
    "all statistical errors should decrease to zero as the cooling rate is reduced .",
    "we can not , of course , guarantee that the results shown in fig .",
    "[ ed ] are completely optimal , but we have carried out the simulations at different cooling rates in order to check the convergence . based on these tests we do believe that the results are converged to their optimum values to within the error bars shown .    for the larger lattices , the energy deviation in fig .",
    "[ ed ] is only @xmath107 , or @xmath4 , and is size independent within statistical errors for @xmath108 .",

    "power - law or exponential  was used for the long - range behavior .",
    "the best power - law wave functions had energy deviations of @xmath52 ; twice as large as we have obtained here with the fully optimized amplitudes .     versus lattice size , compared with unbiased qmc results .",
    "the inset shows the long - distance spin - spin correlation .",

    "the long - distance correlations show deviations that increase slightly with @xmath103 , going to @xmath5 below the true values for @xmath114 [ which then should also be the asymptotic @xmath115 error of @xmath116 .",
    "the sublattice magnetization is the square - root of the long - distance correlation function ; it is thus only @xmath117 smaller than the exact value .     versus the system size .",

    "did not conclusively settle the question of the asymptotic behavior of the amplitudes @xmath1 for bonds of long length @xmath119.@xcite the best variational energy was obtained with an algebraic decay ; @xmath120 .",
    "however , the energy is not very sensitive to the long - distance behavior and the values obtained for @xmath121 and @xmath122 were not substantially different at the level of statistical accuracy achieved .",
    "even with an exponential decay of the bond - length distribution the energy was not appreciably higher , but then no long - range order is possible and hence this form can be excluded . in a recent unbiased projector qmc calculation ,",
    "the probability distribution @xmath123 of the bonds was calculated.@xcite the form @xmath124 was found ( with no discernible angular dependence ) . without a hard - core constraint for the vb dimers ,",
    "the probabilities would clearly be proportional to the amplitudes ; @xmath125 , and even with the hard - core constraint one would expect the two to be strongly related to each other .",
    "in fact , as was pointed out in ref .  , a wave function with @xmath126 does result in @xmath127 .",

    "@xcite there is thus reason to believe that @xmath121 indeed is the correct form for @xmath135 .    for the @xmath17 lattice we can compare the variational wave function with the exact ground state obtained by exact diagonalization .",
    "this comparison is most easily done by transforming the vb state to the @xmath136 basis .",
    "taking into account the lattice symmetries , there are @xmath137 @xmath138 states with momentum @xmath139 , and the matrix can easily be diagonalized .",
    "we generate the @xmath140 vb states @xmath141 using a permutation scheme and convert each of them into @xmath142 @xmath136-basis states with weights @xmath143 , and use these to calculate the overlap with the exact ground state . with the amplitudes normalized by @xmath144 ,",

    "it has also been noted previously that wave functions including only the shortest bonds give the best description of the ground state in a narrow region of high frustration in a model containing also a third - nearest neighbor interaction @xmath157.@xcite    we also show in fig .",

    "_ @xcite recently carried out a variational study of an rvb function written in terms of fermion operators @xcite and found that it gave the best description of the ground state of the j@xmath19j@xmath20 model at large frustration ; @xmath159 .",
    "however , the overlap is significantly smaller than what we have found here for the @xmath17 system at the same level of frustration .",
    "although the fermionic @xcite and bosonic descriptions of the vb states are formally equivalent , the fermionic wave function , as it is normally written , does not span the full space possible with the bosonic product state . as a consequence ,",

    "our results for the @xmath17 lattice , along with the results of ref .  , suggest that the qmc sign problem @xcite should be small up to @xmath154",

    "another interesting question is how bond correlations , which are not included in the wave function considered here , develop as the phase transition at @xmath154 is approached .",
    "we are currently exploring the inclusion of bond - pair correlations to further improve the variational wave function for the heisenberg model as well as more complicated spin models .",
    "the stochastic energy minimization scheme that we have introduced here , which requires only the signs of the first energy derivatives , may also find applications in variational qmc simulations of electronic systems .",
    "recently proposed efficient optimization schemes @xcite need the second energy derivatives , and so our scheme requiring only first derivatives has the potential of significant time savings when the number of variational parameters is large . very recently ,",
    "other powerful schemes also requiring only the first energy derivatives have been developed and have been shown to be applicable to wave functions with a large number of parameters.@xcite we have not yet compared the efficiencies of these different optimization approaches with the stochastic scheme presented here .",

    "<S> we use two different schemes for optimizing the amplitudes ; a newton / conjugate - gradient method and a stochastic method which requires only the signs of the first derivatives of the energy . </S>",
    "<S> the latter method performs significantly better . </S>",
    "<S> the energy for large systems deviates by only @xmath4 from its exact value ( calculated using unbiased quantum monte carlo simulations ) . </S>",
