    "metal hydrides have attracted a lot of attention in the last decades due to a variety of exciting applications especially with regard to the environmentally friendly storage and use of energy . in this context , they have proven as very promising candidates for hydrogen storage , fuel cells applications @xcite , and heat storage for the solar - energy industry @xcite .",
    "these auspicious perspectives are complemented by strong interest from the point of view of fundamental research inter alia because of their role as possible candidates for high - temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "since hydrogen insertion can act as negative pressure it may also cause a switching between different electronic or magnetic states , as has been found , e.g. , in intermetallic cerium compounds @xcite .    especially the palladium - hydrogen system has been investigated since long @xcite due to the fact that palladium allows to absorb comparatively large amounts of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "for this reason , much interest has centered about the maximum amount of hydrogen to be absorbed in the metal as well as the possible hydrogen positions in the parent structure .",
    "this has initiated several structural characterizations as well as theoretical studies .",
    "many investigations focused on the question , which open voids in the underlying face - centered cubic lattice of palladium metal are most likely to be occupied by hydrogen .",
    "especially , for the monohydride the exact position of the hydrogen atoms was a matter of long dispute . according to neutron diffraction data ,",
    "hydrogen atoms occupy the octahedral interstices of the face - centered cubic lattice of pd leading to the rocksalt structure @xcite . however , depending on temperature a transfer of substantial amounts of hydrogen to the tetrahedral interstices , leading to the zincblende structure , has been inferred from neutron diffraction data @xcite . for the palladium - deuterium system a partial occupation of the tetrahedral site was also reported and attributed to the lower zero - point energy of the d interstitial as compared to h @xcite .    due to their increased hydrogen content",
    "as compared to the monohydrides , transition metal dihydrides have also come into focus quite early , see , _",
    "e.g. _  the work by switendick and references therein @xcite . in this case , there was agreement on the fluorite structure .",
    "more recently , the formation of superabundant vacancy structures was observed at high temperatures and high hydrogen pressures , possibly the most prominent example being @xmath3 , which arises from the monohydride on removing pd and forms an ordered structure @xcite .",
    "this vacancy formation is accompanied by a compression of the lattice .    due to the high interest in the palladium - hydrogen system ,",
    "a number of theoretical studies have been performed ranging from simplified non - self - consistent calculations using atomic potentials @xcite to fully self - consistent relativistic state - of - the - art electronic structure calculations as based on density functional theory and ( semi-)local approximations to the exchange - correlation functional @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even the early work by switendick revealed considerable distortions of the pd band structure on hydrogenation and allowed to rule out previous rigid - band considerations @xcite . in particular , based on his finding of only a partial charge transfer from hydrogen to the metal , switendick was the first to abandon the then popular anion and proton models , which were based on an ionic picture .",
    "these findings were lateron confirmed by more refined calculations @xcite .",
    "more recent theoretical work centered about the issue of the hydrogen site in pdh , which was motivated by the afore mentioned disputes @xcite .",
    "as is well known from a number of studies , hydrogen insertion in metals may induce long - range magnetic order via strong magnetovolume effects .",
    "this is especially relevant for paramagnetic palladium , which is at the verge of a ferromagnetic instability . yet ,",
    "in general there is a strong competition between the magnetovolume effects enhancing magnetization and the effects of hydrogen bonding to the underlying metal substructure leading to the suppression of the magnetic order @xcite .    the present work employed electronic structure calculations as based on density functional theory and focusses on the structure - property relationships of several palladium hydrides .",
    "we thus follow two main goals : first , emphasis is on the thermodynamic stability of a variety of palladium hydrides with perfect stoichiometry and different crystal structures .",
    "this includes three possible structures of the monohydride pdh : the observed rocksalt structure , the zincblende structure , and the hexagonal wurtzite structure .",
    "in addition , the hydrogen over - stoichiometric palladium dihydride @xmath4 is considered in both the fluorite and the related pyrite structure .",
    "finally , the above mentioned recent experiments suggested to investigate the new ordered pd - defect phase @xmath3 .",
    "the second goal of this work centers about the calculation of the electronic and magnetic properties as well as chemical bonding indicators , which lead to a deeper understanding of the various phases .",
    "the first principles calculations were based on density functional theory @xcite with exchange - correlation effects accounted for by both the local and semilocal approximation .",
    "two complementary tools were employed :    in a first step , the vienna ab - initio simulation program ( vasp ) as implemented in the medea@xmath5 computational environment of materials design was used to perform total - energy and force calculations aiming at an optimization of the structures @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation functional was considered at three different levels , namely , within the local density approximation @xcite , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite , and the pbesol scheme recently devised especially for the improved treatment of solids @xcite .",
    "the single - particle equations were solved using the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite with a plane - wave basis with a cutoff of 326.203 ev .",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled using a monkhorst - pack mesh with a spacing below 0.1 @xmath6 leading to @xmath7 * k*-points for the rocksalt and zincblende structures as well as @xmath8 * k*-points for the wurtzite structure @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath9 and @xmath10 * k*-points were used for the dihydride and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "phonon spectra were calculated using the phonon software @xcite , which is likewise part of the medea@xmath5 computational environment and used the forces evaluated with the vasp code .",
    "once the optimized structures were known , calculations of the electronic structure and the chemical bonding properties were carried out using the full - potential augmented spherical wave ( asw ) method in its scalar - relativistic implementation @xcite .",
    "exchange and correlation effects were considered using the gga parametrization of wu and cohen @xcite . in the asw method , the wave function is expanded in atom - centered augmented spherical waves , which are hankel functions and numerical solutions of schrdinger s equation , respectively , outside and inside the so - called augmentation spheres . in order to optimize the basis set and enhance the variational freedom , additional augmented spherical waves were placed at carefully selected interstitial sites . the choice of these sites as well as the augmentation radii were automatically determined using the sphere - geometry optimization algorithm @xcite .",
    "self - consistency was achieved by a highly efficient algorithm for convergence acceleration @xcite until the variation of the atomic charges was smaller than @xmath11 electrons and the variation of the total energy was smaller than @xmath11 ryd .",
    "brillouin zone integrations were performed using the linear tetrahedron method @xcite with @xmath7 * k*-points for face - centered cubic pd , @xmath12 * k*-points for the rocksalt structure , @xmath9 * k*-points for the zincblende structure , and @xmath13 * k*-points for the wurtzite structure .",
    "in addition , @xmath14 and @xmath15 * k*-points were used for the dihydride and @xmath3 , respectively .    in the present work , a new full - potential version of the asw method",
    "was employed @xcite . in this version ,",
    "the electron density and related quantities are given by spherical harmonics expansions inside the muffin - tin spheres while , in the remaining interstitial region , a representation in terms of atom - centered hankel functions is used @xcite . however ,",
    "in contrast to previous related implementations , no so - called multiple-@xmath16 basis set is needed , rendering the method computationally nearly as efficient as the original asw scheme .",
    "as mentioned above , three different structures were considered for the monohydride , namely , the rocksalt structure with hydrogen placed at the octahedral sites of the face - centered cubic lattice formed by elemental pd , the zincblende structure with hydrogen being at the tetrahedral sites , and the hexagonal wurtzite structure , which also has the hydrogen atoms at the center of the tetrahedral voids of the pd sublattice .",
    "all structures were fully optimized , i.e.  the lattice vectors as well as the internal coordinates were relaxed using vasp .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab : table1 ] ,    .[tab : table1 ] calculated equilibrium properties of pdh in the rocksalt ( rs ) , zincblende ( zb ) , and wurtzite ( wz ) structures : total energies @xmath17 per formula unit , lattice constants @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as well as hydrogen parameters @xmath20 within lda / pbesol / pbe . calculated properties of palladium metal and experimental data ( from refs .   , , and ) as well as previous calculational results are added for comparison . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as before , we find an increase of the lattice constant on going from lda to pbesol and pbe .",
    "our results are in reasonable agreement with those of isaeva _ et al . _  but deviate from the larger experimental value .",
    "however , they do reproduce the volume reduction on going from pdh to the vacancy phase . finally , we find the zincblende - derived structure at much higher energies than the rocksalt - derived structure , again in agreement with experimental data .",
    "the results of the subsequent calculations of the electronic structure using the asw code are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dospd3h4 ] .     in the rocksalt",
    "( h in octahedral site , top ) and zincblende ( h in tetrahedral site , bottom ) structure.,title=\"fig : \" ]   in the rocksalt ( h in octahedral site , top ) and zincblende ( h in tetrahedral site , bottom ) structure.,title=\"fig : \" ]    here , from the distinction of the @xmath21- and @xmath22-bonding manifolds of the pd @xmath0 states , the strong @xmath21-type overlap of the h @xmath1 orbitals with the @xmath23 and @xmath24 orbitals , respectively , in the rocksalt and zincblende structures becomes obvious .",
    "in addition , we point out that removal of the pd atoms at the corners of the cube leads to two different types of hydrogen atoms in the rocksalt structure , namely , h1 atoms located in the middle of the edges and h2 at the center of the cube . in contrast , in the zincblende - derived vacancy structure , still all hydrogen atoms are equivalent by symmetry .",
    "this has interesting consequences for the electronic states .",
    "while for the zincblende - derived structure only one split - off band in the energy range from @xmath25ev to @xmath26ev is observed , the split - off band in the rocksalt structure falls into two parts : the rather weak low - energy part between @xmath27ev to @xmath28ev arises from overlap of the pd @xmath0 states with the @xmath1 states of the single central h2-type atoms , whereas the strong high - energy part between @xmath28ev to @xmath29ev is due to the overlap with the orbitals of the three h1-type atoms .",
    "this difference in @xmath2-@xmath30 splitting is easily explained from the fact that the h2-type atoms at the center of the cubic cell have six pd neighbors , whereas the h1-type atoms at the edges have only four such neighboring pd atoms . as a consequence ,",
    "these latter atoms experience less overlap with the @xmath0 orbitals . finally , we mention the dip of all partial densities of states just above the fermi energy , which for the dihydride was observed at the fermi energy and attributed to the complete occupation of the @xmath2 shell and the onset of mainly @xmath1-derived bands .    finally , partial covalence energies were calculated and could be well understood from those obtained for the monohydrides and dihydride as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : cooppdpdh ] and [ fig : cooppdh2 ] taking into account the increased h : pd ratio as compared to pdh and the resulting appearance of the additional group of bands as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : pdh2 ] .",
    "in particular , while strong pd @xmath0-h @xmath1 bonding stabilizes the structure , antibonding @xmath2-@xmath2 interactions tend to undermine the overall stability .",
    "in conclusion , three different types of palladium hydrides with varying hydrogen concentration have been investigated by first principles electronic structure calculations using two complementary tools , namely , the vasp and the asw code . for the monohydride pdh",
    "the rocksalt structure has been identified as the ground state in agreement with previous experimental and theoretical work . however , were it not for the zero - point energy , the zincblende structure would be more stable .",
    "in particular , the strong difference in zero - point energy results from the larger voids available for the hydrogen atoms and consequently much softer pd - h bonds in the rocksalt structure as compared to the zincblende and wurtzite structure . as compared to pd metal , insertion of hydrogen into the face - centered cubic lattice leads to the formation of bonding and antibonding @xmath0-@xmath1 states , which are found below and above the remaining pd @xmath0 bands , respectively .",
    "especially , the bonding split - off bands are easily identified and underpinned by recent xps and ups data .",
    "in addition , hydrogenation leads to the upshift of the fermi level to an energy range , where the density of states is low . as a consequence ,",
    "the pd - h bonding prevails over magnetovolume effects , leading to the suppression of magnetic order . for the dihydride @xmath4 ,",
    "the fluorite structure is found to be more stable than the pyrite structure albeit with a very small difference in heat of formation .",
    "the higher hydrogen content leads to an increased complexity of the band structure as compared to the metal and the monohydride due to the formation of a second split - off band below the central @xmath0 bands and of an additional @xmath1-derived band above this group .",
    "finally , for supervacant @xmath3 , our calculations have established the rocksalt - type ground state . a detailed analysis of the electronic structures established the critical importance of strong covalent bonds of directional orbitals for the thermodynamic stability of all these hydrides .",
