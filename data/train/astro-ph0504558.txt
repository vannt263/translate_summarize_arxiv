    "in such a scenario , the absorption could arise at the interface between infalling cooler gas clouds and very hot ( @xmath17k ) gas in an extended galactic corona .",

    "unfortunately , existing x - ray data have not been of sufficiently high quality to resolve this ambiguity : even at large column densities ( @xmath18@xmath19 ) , x - ray lines are quite weak , and several thousand counts per resolution element in a typical  grating spectrum are required to accurately measure these lines .    through our program of observing nearby blazars in outburst phases , we have obtained high  quality and  spectra of mkn  421 , sufficient to study in detail the local whim ( and galactic halo / thick disk ) absorption . here",

    "an asymmetric wing on the red side of this line is evident , possibly a kinematically distinct hvc .",
    "we fitted the  1032  line in  using a constant local continuum ( in a @xmath49  window ) and two gaussian absorption components : one for the @xmath50  line , and one at @xmath51 for the hvc .",

    "fit model for the hvc is fairly robust and not sensitive to variations in the initial parameters ; however , the derived equivalent width of @xmath54m  is lower than the @xmath55m  ( errors are statistical and systematic , respectively ) measured by @xcite in the initial 21.8ks observation .",
    "they employed a direct integration method which may not have taken into account the substantial blending of the galactic  with the hvc .",
    "our total  equivalent width ( lv@xmath56hvc @xmath57m ) is in good agreement with their value of @xmath58m .",
    "deblending the  1037  line is less certain due to the presence of adjacent galactic and h@xmath45 absorption .",
    "a flat continuum was again employed from @xmath59  and single gaussian components were used to fit the , , and h@xmath45 absorption lines .",
    "the hvc on the 1032  line should also appear at @xmath60  with @xmath61(1032 ) .",
    "although this component is too weak to be detected directly , it could cause the measurement of the galactic lv  1037  line to be systematically high .",
    "another absorption gaussian with one  half of the 1032  hvc equivalent width ( and with the same fwhm and velocity offset ) was included in the 1037  line fit to account for this .",
    "table  [ tab_lines ] lists the measured properties of the  and hvc absorption lines .",
    "to convert the measured equivalent widths to ionic column densities , we calculated curves of growth for each absorption line over a grid of doppler parameters ( @xmath62 ) and column densities ( @xmath63 ) , assuming a voigt line profile . since the x - ray lines are unresolved , @xmath64 can not be measured directly .",
    "it can , however , be inferred from the relative strengths of the three measured  k  series lines .",
    "these lines are produced by the same ionic species , so in an unsaturated medium @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the oscillator strength .",
    "the expected equivalent width ratio of  k@xmath67 to k@xmath2 is then @xmath68 , so the measured value of @xmath69 indicates that the k@xmath2 line is saturated . on the other hand ,",
    "the measured   @xmath70 ratio is @xmath71 , in agreement with the predicted ( unsaturated ) value of @xmath72 .",
    "these line ratios by themselves are insufficient to determine the physical state of the absorbing medium since @xmath64 and @xmath73 are degenerate : the k@xmath2 line saturation could be due to high column density , low @xmath64 , or a combination of both .",
    "however , given an absorption line with a measured equivalent width and known @xmath74 value , the inferred column density as a function of the doppler parameter can be calculated . the measured equivalent width ( and errors ) for each transition thus defines a region in the @xmath75 plane .",
    "since the actual value of @xmath73 is fixed , @xmath64 and @xmath73 can be determined by the region over which the contours `` overlap ; '' i.e. the range of doppler parameters for which the different transitions provide consistent @xmath73 measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig_nbovii ] shows such @xmath76 contours for the three measured  transitions .",
    "as expected , the inferred @xmath73 is nearly constant in the unsaturated regime ( large @xmath64 ) , and rises sharply at low @xmath64 as the lines begin to saturate . at each value of @xmath64 , the differences @xmath77 and @xmath78 were calculated , along with the errors on each @xmath79 .",
    "the quantity @xmath80 is consistent with zero at the @xmath76 and @xmath3 levels for @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively , while @xmath83 provides limits of @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "since @xmath83 provides a more stringent lower limit on @xmath64 while @xmath80 better constrains the upper limit , we thus assume a @xmath76 range of @xmath86 , and a @xmath3 range of @xmath4 .",
    "it should be noted that figure  [ fig_nbovii ] also shows some overlap between the @xmath87 and @xmath88 at @xmath89 ; however , this solution is unlikely given the lower limit provided by the @xmath90 line .",
    "moreover , @xmath91 implies a maximum temperature ( assuming purely thermal motion ) of @xmath92k ; such a low temperature is unlikely to produce the observed strong high  ionization lines .",
    "a similar analysis is not as effective when applied to the strong   uv doublet ( from the thick disk ) , since these lines are only slightly saturated : the measured @xmath93 ratio is @xmath94 , compared to the expected unsaturated value of 0.50 . when the inferred @xmath95 is calculated as a function of @xmath64 for both lines of the  doublet , the predicted @xmath95 values are consistent over @xmath96 ( at the @xmath3 level ; see figure  [ fig_nbovi ] ) .",
    "since the  1032  line is fully resolved by  ( @xmath97 resolution elements across the line profile ) and relatively unblended , its doppler parameter can be estimated much more accurately using the measured line width and strength . in an unsaturated absorption line , @xmath98 ; however , the measured fwhm increases if the line is saturated . we compensated for this by calculating voigt profile fwhms on a grid of @xmath95 and @xmath64 , and determining the region consistent with the  1032  fwhm measurement of @xmath99 ( or @xmath100 assuming no saturation ) .    when the fwhm ",
    "derived contour is overlaid on the @xmath101 contour inferred from the equivalent width measurement of the lv  1032  line , the two regions overlap nearly orthogonally ( figure  [ fig_nbovi ] ) leading to a constraint of @xmath64()@xmath102 .",
    "this is @xmath103 lower than the unsaturated fwhm , once again confirming that the  is only weakly saturated . at this @xmath64",
    "the inferred column densities from the two lines of the  doublet differ by @xmath104 but this is only a minor discrepancy and likely due to errors introduced by the blending of the 1037  line ; thus , we will only consider results from the more reliable 1032  line measurement .",
    "however , at no value of the doppler parameter do the 1032 , 1037 , and @xmath7 lines all produce a consistent @xmath95 measurement ; in fact , the @xmath7 column density is a factor of @xmath8 higher than that inferred from the uv data .",
    "this discrepancy is discussed further in  [ sec_ovi ] .",
    "the doppler parameters measured for the  ( @xmath105 ) and  ( @xmath106 ) absorption are inconsistent at the @xmath5 level , indicating the presence of at least two distinct components : the galactic thick ",
    "disk gas traced by broad @xmath50  absorption , and another lower@xmath64 phase , possibly of extragalactic origin , traced by the  absorption lines .",
    "it can not be assumed _ a priori _ that any given line ( other than those used to determine @xmath64 ) originates in one phase or another ; moreover , the uncertainty in the calculated column density depends not only on the equivalent width error but also the error in @xmath64 . to take this into account , for each ion the derived column density @xmath107 and its @xmath108 limits",
    "were averaged over the @xmath108 ranges of both measured doppler parameters .",
    "as it turns out , the choice of @xmath64 does not make a significant difference since all other lines ( besides the  and  absorption ) are essentially unsaturated ; i.e. , the difference in @xmath109 calculated with the  and  doppler parameters is small compared to the @xmath76 error on the equivalent width measurements .",
    "even so , to avoid possible systematic errors , we assumed @xmath110 for those lines _",
    "likely _ to originate in the galactic thick disk ( , , and ) , and @xmath111 for all other species .",
    "the derived ionic column densities are listed in table  [ tab_lines ]      at densities such as those found in the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ; @xmath112@xmath12 ) , photoionization is unimportant because thermal collisions are by far the dominant ionization source .",
    "this is also the case for very high temperatures ( @xmath113k ) even at low densities , since the collisional rate is greater than the photoionization rate .",
    "however , at the low densities typically found in the intergalactic medium ( @xmath114@xmath12 ) , photoionization from the diffuse uv / x - ray background begins to play a greater role by enriching the abundances of highly ",
    "ionized elements at typical whim temperatures ( @xmath115 ) relative to those expected from pure collisional ionization @xcite .",
    "it is thus imperative that the ionizing background be taken into account in order to accurately predict ionic abundances in the whim .",

    "@xcite was used to compute collisional plus photoionization hybrid models for the absorbing medium .",
    "relative ionic abundances were computed over a grid of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , with a step size of 0.1  dex in both @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",

    "is then given by @xmath124photonss@xmath21@xmath19 , and the ionization parameter is @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the electron density in @xmath12 .    using the ionic abundances calculated with",
    "_ cloudy _ , we derived expected abundance ratios for all observed ions at each point in the @xmath127 plane . since any given density and temperature uniquely determines a set of abundance ratios ( @xmath128 for all ions @xmath129 and @xmath64 ) , the problem can be inverted : any value of @xmath128 defines a curve in the @xmath127 plane , i.e. a set of temperatures and densities which can produce the measured ratio .",
    "when the errors on @xmath128 are taken into account , the curves become contours , and the overlap between two or more contours defines the temperatures and densities for which the measured ratios are consistent .",

    "* ) ; however , in these cases it is typically attributed to saturation or a velocity  dependent covering factor , neither of which is relevant to this @xmath0 absorption .    on the other hand ,",
    "our @xmath7 measurement provides a test for these attributions ; the local absorption , after all , is likely a dramatically different physical system than an agn outflow , yet the same conflict arises .",
    "a macroscopic explanation does not adequately describe how this discrepancy is seen in both physical systems , so the actual reason may lie in the atomic physics of highly ionized plasmas .",
    "for example , some fraction of the   may be excited through collisions or recombination from , and thus unable to produce 1032  absorption while still absorbing @xmath7 photons .",
    "while a scenario that produces significant depopulation of the  ground state is difficult to envisage in such a low density plasma , we are investigating further the statistical equilibrium of  including photoexcitation and recombination in order to study such effects in more detail .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that this is not an isolated case so there must be a physical explanation for the   discrepancy , and the resolution of this paradox is crucial to our understanding of  uv and x - ray absorption and how it relates to the .",
    "there is also the possibility that the line was misidentified as @xmath7 , and is actually another intervening   absorption line at @xmath142 .",
    "this latter explanation is unlikely since no other absorption lines at this redshift are seen in the  or  spectra ; additionally , this would require the line to fall exactly on the  rest wavelength , which seems like an improbable coincidence .",
    "another possibility is that the theoretical oscillator strength of the @xmath7 transition is incorrect , but the value given in @xcite would need to be low by a factor of @xmath143 , in sharp contrast to the successful calculations of @xmath144 for inner shell transitions in other ions in the same paper . nevertheless , due to the discrepancy between the uv and x - ray  column density measurements , we present both possibilities : either ( a ) the @xmath7 line measures @xmath95 , or ( b ) it does not and is thus ignored .",
    "the doppler parameter measurements indicate the existence of two distinct components along the mkn  421 line of sight : one seen in the thick  disk  1032  absorption with @xmath145 , and the   absorber with @xmath146 ( @xmath76 limits ) .",
    "the  hvc may represent a third phase ( if case ( b ) above is correct ) with @xmath147 ( from the fwhm measurement ) .",
    "this agrees surprisingly well with the @xmath64 measurement , and is consistent with numerical simulations of the nearby igm @xcite .",
    "however , the extremely low @xmath6/  ratio requires a temperature much higher than the upper limit provided by @xmath148 . in order for the hvc to trace the same gas as  ( case a ) , then",
    ", the aforementioned atomic physics effects would need to be suppressing  hvc absorption and not the  line .",
    "@xcite list mean doppler parameters for a variety of hvcs , both galactic and probable local group ; unfortunately , the dispersion in these values and the errors on @xmath148 and @xmath149 measured here are both too large to associate the components presented here to one of their classifications .",
    "it is also important to note that our analysis assumes a single phase origin for the included x - ray lines .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the data , given the good agreement between the three  lines in the calculated ranges of @xmath64 and @xmath95  ( figure  [ fig_nbovii ] ) .",
    "even so , if any of the ionic species arises in more than one phase along the line of sight , our results could be affected .",
    "for example , a galactic , purely collisionally ionized medium can in principle reproduce the observed relative abundances of , , @xmath7 , and  if several unresolved components are invoked to explain this absorption .",
    "however , the simplest explanation ( a single  phase , low  density , partially photoionized extragalactic absorber ) is fully consistent with all of these line measurements , and the similarity of the derived absorber properties to expectations for the local whim lend further support to this model ( see  [ sec_origin ] ) .      due to the uncertainty associated with the @xmath7 absorption , metal abundances relative to oxygen",
    "play a particularly important role in this analysis . by adjusting the metal abundances of the absorbing gas ,",
    "the consistency of the solutions can in principle be improved with and without the @xmath7 measurement .",
    "although the @xmath127 contour plots are useful for finding solutions , they can not easily be used to determine the effects of changes in elemental abundances ; thus , figure  [ fig_ewtplots ] shows @xmath150 as a function of @xmath119 for both the @xmath151 and @xmath152 cases . in this figure ,",
    "the @xmath153ranges given by the measured ratios ( thick lines ) shift up and down as a result of decreases and increases in the abundances relative to oxygen , respectively ; thus different parts of the theoretical curves would be in bold , moving the allowed temperature ranges ( shown in the lower panel ) to the left or right .",
    "solar abundances here are taken to be the _ cloudy _",
    "90 defaults @xcite .    in case ( a ) ,",
    "i.e.  if the @xmath7 measurement of @xmath95 is correct , then the temperature and density of the absorber are tightly constrained in a metallicity  independent manner , and relative abundances for other elements can be estimated . under this assumption ,",
    "the oxygen ion ratios are consistent within a range of @xmath132@xmath12 ; however at solar abundances the /  ratio demands higher temperatures than allowed by the @xmath7/  ratio . over this range of densities , the permitted abundances of neon , carbon , and nitrogen abundances",
    "relative to oxygen ( that is , the range of abundances which produce line ratios consistent with both @xmath7/  _ and _ / ) are then @xmath154[ne / o]@xmath155 , @xmath156 [ c / o]@xmath157 , and [ n / o]@xmath158 .",
    "note that supersolar [ ne / o ] has also been observed in the @xmath15 absorber toward pks2155304 @xcite .",
    "the improvement in the fit from supersolar [ ne / o ] is shown in the right panel of fig  [ fig_allplot ] .",
    "note , however , that in this case the discrepancy between the @xmath7 and 1032  measurements becomes even more severe . since the bulk of the  can not be associated with the  due to the different doppler parameters , the uv  component associated with the whim ( hence the @xmath7 ) must be substantially weaker than the galactic  absorption ; thus the discrepancy is correspondingly larger .    on the other hand ,",
    "if ( b ) the @xmath7 line is ignored then the relative abundances in the absorber can be adjusted such that the measured line ratios are consistent with either a low or high  density absorber . as shown in figure  [ fig_allplot ] , a high  density , collisionally ",
    "ionized medium fits the data with solar abundances . assuming this is the case , the temperature is then completely constrained by the /  ratio at @xmath159k , and the relative abundances consistent with the /  ratio in this temperature range are @xmath160[ne / o]@xmath161 , @xmath160[c / o]@xmath157 , and [ n / o]@xmath162 .",
    "the requirement that [ ne / o ] be supersolar does not affect the viability of the partially ",
    "photoionized model : in both the ism and low@xmath13 igm , [ ne / o ] is observed to be significantly larger than the solar value ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may be an intrinsic property of the enriched gas ejected into the igm and ism , or instead could be due to depletion of c , n , and o onto dust grains in supernova ejecta or quasar winds @xcite .",
    "if the dust destruction timescale is long and the igm is continuously enriched by this latter mechanism , then the observed supersolar [ ne / o ] would be expected .",
    "all of these enrichment scenarios are quite uncertain , but few ( if any ) are able to produce [ ne / o]@xmath163 . indeed , the solar neon abundance itself is quite uncertain since it is inferred from solar wind measurements .",
    "the increase in the solar neon abundance proposed by @xcite is supported by these observations , and may provide another physical argument for the lack of subsolar [ ne / o ] .      assuming the  absorption system is homogeneous , its radial extent can be estimated by calculating @xmath164 , where @xmath165 , @xmath166 ( solar abundance ) , and @xmath167}.\\ ] ] the second term in the equation is approximately unity , since over the range of temperatures and densities implied from the /   ratio ,  is the dominant ionization state by at least an order of magnitude ; thus , @xmath168=\\{20.37-([{\\rm o / h}]+1)\\}\\pm 0.11 $ ] . the measurement error on @xmath73 is small compared to the uncertainty range in @xmath126 , so it can be disregarded . assuming that ( a ) the @xmath7 line does measure @xmath95 , the @xmath3 range of densities is @xmath169 , resulting in a radial extent of @xmath170 + 1)}$]mpc .",
    "these radial extents are consistent with those expected from a local group medium or local filament interpretation for this absorption @xcite and too large to be confined within a galactic halo",
    ". the absorber extent could be marginally consistent with a galactic corona if the metallicity is high ( @xmath171kpc , @xmath3 limits at solar metallicity ) ; however , such a scenario seems implausible , particularly if this corona primarily consists of gas accreted from the metal  poor igm .",
    "it is unlikely that this absorption system , if extragalactic , is spherically symmetric ( particularly in a `` local filament '' interpretation ) .",
    "the total mass in the  system can be written as @xmath172 , where @xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) parameterizes the departure from spherical symmetry and @xmath175 .",

    "baryonic matter should only contribute @xmath180 of this mass ( if the baryon  to  dark matter ratio is equal to the cosmological value ) , so our estimate appears high .",
    "this discrepancy can be easily resolved with different values of [ o / h ] and @xmath173 .",
    "for instance , if we assume an oxygen abundance of @xmath181 times solar rather than 0.1 , then the range of possible masses becomes @xmath182 .",
    "thus , unless [ o / h ] is very high or @xmath183 , the  absorber almost certainly accounts for a major fraction of the baryonic matter in the local group .",
    "this sightline may also be probing gas that is not gravitationally bound to the local group ( i.e. , the local filament ) , which may explain why our range of @xmath184 extends to such high values . although @xcite argue that a local group origin requires that the  absorbers contain too much mass , we see here that the total mass is in fact consistent with expectations .",
    "if this absorption does only trace the local group medium , then constraints on the extent of the absorber can be derived by assuming @xmath185 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath186 . taking the @xmath3 upper limit of @xmath187 , the @xmath3 lower limit on @xmath188 , and assuming @xmath189",
    ", we obtain a lower limit of @xmath190mpc for the  absorption .",
    "similarly , the upper limit on the radius is @xmath191mpc .",
    "this seems somewhat small compared to the actual size of the local group , but once again is dependent on the geometry of the absorber .",
    "a value of @xmath192 brings this upper limit more in line with the mpc scales expected in the local group ; this may indicate that the mkn  421 line of sight probes an extended , filamentary whim distribution .",
    "this calculation also assumes that the density of the local group medium is constant with radius , when the actual density profile is more likely centrally concentrated .",
    "these measurements are also affected by the  discrepancy : in case ( b ) , only the lower density limit of @xmath193 ( from the @xmath3  k@xmath2 upper limit ) applies , so the upper radius and mass limits are still valid . nevertheless , the consistency with the expected local group parameters is intriguing .",
    "@xcite used constrained simulations to study the properties of the local supercluster region ; sky maps produced from this simulation ( their figure  5 ) show filamentary structures near the mkn  421 direction , possibly corresponding to the observed absorption . additionally , they note that a local group medium would exhibit a low doppler parameter ( @xmath194kms@xmath21 ) out to distances of @xmath195mpc , consistent with our  measurement .",
    "the inferred properties of the x - ray absorption along this line of sight also appear similar to other observations : toward 3c  273 , for example , @xcite find @xmath196 and comparable   column density ; however , their inferred  doppler parameter is significantly higher than that toward mkn  421 : @xmath197 . on the other hand , the @xmath15 absorber toward pks  @xmath198 @xcite exhibits a temperature consistent with the mkn  421 absorber , yet inferred density about an order of magnitude lower .",
    "compared to the two intervening filaments seen toward mkn  421 @xcite , the density of the @xmath15 absorption agrees with the derived lower limits ( @xmath199 for both filaments ) , but the filaments appear to exhibit higher temperatures than that derived for the local absorption .",
    "these variations along different lines of sight simply demonstrate the complex nature of the absorption , and the diversity of temperature and density environments produced in the structure formation process ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the detection of x - ray absorption lines toward the large magellanic cloud binary lmc x-3 by @xcite presents an important consideration for these results as well .",
    "the measured  and  equivalent widths and upper limits on  and @xmath200 are all consistent with the same lines measured toward mkn  421 ( albeit with much larger statistical errors ) .",
    "although this detection provides evidence of a hot intervening absorber between the galaxy and lmc , it certainly does not rule out a primarily extragalactic origin for the mkn  421 absorber .",
    "any absorption , either galactic or extragalactic , is likely to be inhomogeneous ; thus , it s entirely plausible that the lmc x-3 sightline probes hot galactic gas ( perhaps enhanced by winds or outflows from both the galaxy and lmc ) , while the absorption toward mkn  421 is primarily due to low  density nearby whim gas .",
    "through long  duration  and  observations of mkn  421 in outburst , we have obtained unprecedented measurements of a variety of @xmath0 absorption lines , many of which likely arise in extragalactic , partially photoionized gas .",
    "a brief summary of our results follows .    1 .",
    "the relative strengths of the three  k - series lines imply @xmath3 doppler parameter constraints of @xmath201kms@xmath21 .",
    "this is inconsistent with the value of @xmath202kms@xmath21 derived for the galactic low ",
    "velocity , indicating that the   and  likely arise in different phases .",
    "the  @xmath64 value is , however , consistent with the local igm simulations of @xcite out to distances of several mpc .",
    "2 .   a weak high ",
    "velocity  1032  component also appears in the  spectrum .",
    "although its width is consistent with the  @xmath64 measurement , the @xmath6 column density is too low to be associated with the  absorption unless @xmath113k ( which itself is ruled out by the upper limit on @xmath64 ) .",
    "the @xmath6 may thus represent a distinct third component along this line of sight .",
    "3 .   the column density inferred from the k@xmath203 line is a factor of @xmath8 higher than that measured from the  1032transition .",
    "this may be due to unaccounted  for atomic physics effects , in which case the k@xmath2 line may provide a more accurate measurement of @xmath95 than the 1032  line .",
    "we consider both cases : 1 .",
    "if the  k@xmath2 line measures @xmath95 , then strong constraints on the temperature , density , and relative abundances of the x - ray absorber can be derived : @xmath133k and @xmath132@xmath12 , with allowed abundances of @xmath154[ne / o]@xmath155 , @xmath156[c / o]@xmath157 , and [ n / o]@xmath158 ( all @xmath3 ranges ) .",
    "this range of densities , combined with @xmath73 , implies a total mass and extent consistent with those expected in the local group and/or local filament if the gas metallicity is low . however , in this case the  uv  x - ray discrepancy becomes worse since ( due to the doppler parameter constraints ) only a small portion of the  line can be associated with the extragalactic x - ray lines . 2 .",
    "if , instead , the  k@xmath2 line does not correctly measure @xmath95 , then the  associated with the  absorption must be fully blended with the galactic 1032  , and thus not measurable . in this case a lower density limit of @xmath204 is found , which is consistent with either a galactic or extragalactic medium .",
    "much work remains to be done  both in order to better understand the data presented here , and to determine the true nature of the @xmath0 x - ray absorption .",
    "higher signal to noise data along the mkn  421 sightline would be useful to obtain better column density constraints , particularly on , @xmath7 , and , and thus better constrain the effects of photoionization on the absorber .",
    "data of comparable quality along other sightlines would be invaluable as well , both to probe other regions surrounding the galaxy and to reconfirm the tantalizing  results presented herein .",
    "higher  resolution simulations of the local group may allow us to determine the ionic column densities expected in the whim , and thus whether or not the observed absorption can possibly arise in the whim .",
    "finally , more detailed modeling of  inner  shell transitions would shed a great deal of light on whether or not the  x - ray / uv discrepancy is real , and thus provide an invaluable framework for studying new ( and existing ) x - ray data .",
