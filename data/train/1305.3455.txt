    "@xmath14    a braid is said to be _ strongly quasipositive _ if it can be written as a positive word in band generators .",
    "( see  2 for the definition of band generators . ) a knot which is the closure of such a braid is called a _ strongly quasipositive knot_. it is known by rudolph  ( * ? ? ? * corollary ) that @xmath15 holds for strongly quasipositive knots @xmath2 with arbitrary braid index .",

    "it is obvious that @xmath4 holds for the knots of types ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "( in fact , the equality @xmath17 holds for these knots .",

    "gives a complete classification of the knots with @xmath46 .",
    "we close this section by explaining briefly the ideas of the proofs of theorems  [ thm : main ] and  [ thm : equal ] .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] is based on the following : any nontrivial 3-braid knot is represented by a word @xmath48 ( in band generators ) that is a shortest word in its conjugacy class .",

    "this is the key idea of the proof of theorem  [ thm : equal ] .",
