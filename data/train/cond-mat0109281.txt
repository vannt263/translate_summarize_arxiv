    "the qualitative features of simple atomic fluids are often modelled using the hard sphere pair potential : zero for @xmath2 and infinite for @xmath3 .",
    "it is well - known that the thermodynamic and structural features of the hard sphere fluid are represented continuously by the soft sphere @xmath4 potential in the limit @xmath5 . in contrast , the dynamical properties for hard and soft sphere fluids are different  since the collision time ( time required for finite momentum transfer ) is strictly zero in the former case and of order @xmath6 in the latter case .",
    "as shown below , this has a significant effect on the short time behavior of time correlation functions .",
    "recently , powles and co - workers heyes , powles1,powles2 have investigated the time correlation functions determining the shear and bulk viscosity for the @xmath0 fluid at large values of @xmath1 ( up to @xmath7 ) .",
    "the initial values of these functions diverges @xmath8 , and the simulation results for the normalized correlation functions appear to scale with the single characteristic time @xmath9 .",
    "these results are puzzling when considered as an approach to the hard sphere limit .",
    "the initial values , i.e. the equal time stress tensor fluctuations , are related to elastic constants which should be finite for the hard sphere fluid . also , the only time scale in the problem @xmath10 vanishes for large @xmath1 leaving no finite time dynamics for the hard spheres fluid . in this picture , the finite green - kubo shear viscosity results from the product of the diverging initial condition and a vanishing correlation time .",
    "clearly , the relationship of properties at large @xmath1 to those at @xmath11 must be more complex .",
    "the objective here is to resolve these paradoxes by calculating the corresponding properties for the hard sphere  fluid directly to allow comparison with those at large @xmath1 .",
    "attention is restricted to the response function for shear viscosity , but similar results apply for the bulk viscosity response function as well .",
    "standard methods of linear response lead to green - kubo expressions for the shear viscosity as the time integral of a shear response function . for soft spheres this response function is proportional to the autocorrelation function for the microscopic stress tensor . the form of the stress tensor is identified from the micrscopic local conservation law for the momentum density . since it explicitly involves the interparticle force ,",
    "a divergence for large @xmath1 can be anticipated .",
    "application of the same linear response methods for the hard sphere fluid lead to several differences :    * the response function is not simply the stress tensor autocorrelation function , as for soft spheres , but has an additional singular contribution proportional to @xmath12 . * the coefficient of the singular contribution can be calculated exactly and is simply related to the limiting form of the stress fluctuations for the soft sphere fluid . * the form of the microscopic stress tensor for hard spheres is quite different from that for soft spheres , and the initial value of the stress tensor autocorrelation function is finite . *",
    "the hard sphere stress tensor autocorrelation function has a characteristic time scale of the mean free time , which is the same as that for the soft sphere fluid at large @xmath1 .",
    "the singular part of the hard sphere correlation function evolves continuously from the soft sphere correlation function as @xmath13 , and is closely related to the divergent initial value .",
    "the results of powles et al . are shown to be an accurate measurement of this singular part",
    ". however , the resolution of this component in the simulation tends to mask the finite remainder that persists on the  mean free path time scale , whose existence is clear from the hard sphere calculations and which is essential for the correct density dependence of transport properties .",
    "an alternative representation of the simulation results is proposed to more closely demonstrate the approach to the hard sphere limit .",
    "the relevant features of the dynamics and statistical mechanics of hard spheres are introduced in the next section to provide the necessary definitions and to contrast with the corresponding features for soft spheres . in section",
    "iii the results for linear response to a transverse velocity field perturbation are quoted , and the green - kubo expression is identified .",
    "the singular contribution is evaluated exactly and given a representation appropriate for comparison with the md simulation results .",
    "the remainder , determined from the stress tensor autocorrelation function for hard spheres is evaluated in an enskog approximation . the limiting form for soft spheres approaching the hard sphere limit",
    "is discussed on the basis of these results .",
    "some final comments are offered in section iv .",
    "it is a pleasure to dedicate this brief contribution to keith gubbins - friend , mentor , and colleague - who has played such an important role in unfolding the mysteries of transport in simple and complex fluids .",
    "any interatomic potential with discontinuities ( e.g. , hard sphere , square well ) implies an infinite force at the point of discontinuity . consequently , the usual formulation of newtonian dynamics in terms of forces alone is no longer appropriate . in this section",
    "the dynamics and statistical mechanics for a system of @xmath14 smooth hard spheres with diameter @xmath15 is reviewed briefly @xcite .",
    "the dynamics consists of free streaming until a given pair @xmath16 is in contact , at which  point the relative velocity of that pair changes instantaneously according to the elastic collision rule @xmath17here @xmath18 is the relative velocity for particles @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the state of the system at time @xmath21 is completely characterized by the positions and velocities of all spheres at that time and is represented by a point in the associated @xmath22 dimensional phase space , @xmath23 .",
    "the sequence of free streaming and binary collisions determines uniquely these positions and velocities of the spheres at time @xmath21 for given initial conditions .",
    "a more complete notation expressing this dependence on initial conditions is @xmath24 .",
    "observables of interest are represented by the phase functions @xmath25 , and their average for given statistical initial data at @xmath26 is defined by    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the probability density or ensemble for the initial state , normalized to unity .",
    "an equivalent representation of this average is obtained by changing variables to integrate over @xmath29 rather than over @xmath30 expressed as a function of @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath31 .",
    "this change of variables in ( [ 2.2 ] ) allows the time dependence to be expressed in terms of the probability density @xmath32where the probability density at time @xmath21 is defined by @xmath33 .",
    "the jacobian of the transformation is unity .",
    "all of the above is the same for both hard and soft spheres .",
    "the equilibrium time correlation functions for observables @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined by @xmath36where @xmath37 . the gibbs distribution given by @xmath38is a stationary state for the hard sphere dynamics .",
    "the  overlap ",
    "function @xmath39 is defined to vanish if any pair overlap , @xmath40 , and is normalized to unity when integrated over all configuration space .",
    "the equilibrium correlation function is stationary @xmath41where @xmath42 has the time reversed dynamics .    for practical purposes",
    "it is useful to identify the generators @xmath43 and @xmath44  for the two representations , defined for @xmath45 by @xmath46these are not the usual generators of hamilton s equations for continuous forces and are somewhat more complex due to the singular nature of hard spheres .",
    "they are given by @xmath47the first terms on the right sides generate free streaming while the second terms describe velocity changes .",
    "the three binary collision operators , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , for particles @xmath19 and @xmath20 are given by @xmath50@xmath51 ,   \\label{2.12}\\]]where @xmath52 denotes the solid angle integration for the unit vector @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the relative position vector of the two particles , and the operator @xmath55 is a substitution operator , @xmath56 , which changes the relative velocity @xmath18 into its scattered velocity according to ( [ 2.3 ] ) @xmath57 . for continuous potentials all generators are the same @xmath58 but for hard spheres all three generators clearly are different .    the local microscopic conservation laws follow from the above dynamics by differentiating the local conserved densities of mass , energy , and momentum with respect to time .",
    "the relevant conservation law for the discussion here is that for momentum density @xmath59 @xmath60 the subscript @xmath61 distinguishes the forms of the momentum flux for the case @xmath45 and @xmath62 .",
    "the detailed expression for @xmath63 is not required below , only its volume integral @xmath64 this form for the hard sphere momentum flux(es ) can be contrasted with that for the soft sphere potential @xmath65@xmath66 which can be written for large @xmath1 as @xmath67 while ( [ 2.15 ] ) and ( [ 2.17 ] ) are similar , both involving a surface integral for pairs of particles at contact , there are two significant differences .",
    "the hard sphere stress tensor is momentum dependent and the soft sphere stress tensor is proportional to @xmath1 , diverging in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "the results of the last section now allow a discussion of the response functions for the hard sphere fluid .",
    "attention here is restricted to the response to an initial transverse perturbation of the velocity field , @xmath68 .",
    "the velocity field for @xmath69 much larger than the mean free path and for times long compared to the mean free time then obeys the diffusion equation @xmath70where @xmath71 is the shear viscosity and @xmath72 is the equilibrium density .",
    "the derivation of this result is straightforward using the standard methods of linear response and the liouville dynamics defined in the last section .",
    "the details will be given elsewhere @xcite and only  the results discussed here .",
    "the shear viscosity is given by the green - kubo expression @xmath73    \\label{3.3}\\]]where @xmath74for soft spheres @xmath75 @xmath76and @xmath77 since @xmath78 is independent of the particle velocities while @xmath79 is an odd function of the  velocities .",
    "thus , the usual green - kubo form for the shear viscosity in terms of the time integral of the stress tensor autocorrelation function is regained @xmath80 in contrast , @xmath81 does not vanish for hard spheres .",
    "the equivalence of ( [ 3.3 ] ) and ( 3.4 ) in the limit of @xmath5 requires @xmath82this is the primary observation of this work regarding the relationship of shear response for soft and hard spheres .",
    "the hard and soft sphere stress autocorrelation functions differ by a singular term .    to explore this relationship ,",
    "two results are noted .",
    "first , for hard spheres the coefficient of the singular term can be calculated exactly to get dufty @xmath83also , for soft spheres the exact initial condition is @xcite @xmath84 .",
    "\\label{3.7}\\]]here @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 is the pressure @xmath88and @xmath89 is the equilibrium pair correlation function evaluated at @xmath90 . equation ( [ 3.7 ] ) shows the divergence of the high frequency shear modulus , @xmath91 , an @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the dominant short time behavior of @xmath92 for soft spheres with large @xmath1 is @xmath93    \\label{3.9}\\]]with the characteristic short time scale @xmath94comparison of ( [ 3.6 ] ) and ( [ 3.7 ] ) shows the relationship @xmath95note that the left side is finite in this limit due to the factor of @xmath96 .",
    "these results provide an appropriate means to discuss and interpret the simulation results of reference @xcite .",
    "the stress tensor autocorrelation function is written as @xmath97and the simulation data is reported for the normalized correlation function @xmath98 ( a subscript @xmath1 has been included since the simulations are performed for @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) .",
    "it is found that the results are globally well - fit by @xmath101 _ { sim}\\approx \\text{sech}\\left ( a\\frac{t}{\\tau _ { n}}% \\right ) .",

    "this is the puzzling result mentioned in the introduction above .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath104 in ( [ 3.12 ] ) diverges for large @xmath1 while @xmath105 _ { sim}$ ] is a  universal ",
    "function of time with a vanishing time scale .",
    "to understand this paradoxical behavior combine ( 3.11 ) - ( [ 3.13 ] ) to get , for large @xmath1@xmath106 _ { sim } & = & \\left ( -\\frac{2}{v}\\left\\langle   { \\cal t}_{+xy}\\lambda _ { xy}\\right\\rangle _ { e}\\right ) \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi } } { % 4\\tau _ { n}}\\text{sech}\\left ( a\\frac{t}{\\tau _ { n}}\\right )    \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left ( -\\frac{2}{v}\\left\\langle { \\cal t}_{+xy}\\lambda _ { xy}\\right\\rangle _ { e}\\right ) \\delta _ { n}\\left ( t\\right )    \\label{3.14}\\end{aligned}\\]]in the second line @xmath107 is a representation of the delta function as @xmath5 defined by @xmath108it is now clear that the md simulation has measured the singular contribution on the right side of ( [ 3.5a ] ) .",
    "this reinterpretation of the md results shows a remarkable confirmation of the hard sphere singular contribution evolving continuously from the soft sphere stress autocorrelation function .",
    "it also demonstrates the role of the diverging shear modulus in constructing the amplitude of @xmath109 . finally , the paradox of the vanishing time scale is now understood as well . the second term on the right side of ( [ 3.5a ] ) is expected to have a time scale of the order of the mean free time ( see below ) , but has not been well - resolved by the simulations .",
    "the normalization to define @xmath110 , appropriate to identify this singular term , makes observation of the second term difficult since it then vanishes as @xmath111 .",
    "still , such deviations from the fit ( [ 3.13 ] ) are observed in the simulations , as noted below .",
    "the second term in ( [ 3.5a ] ) is the hard sphere stress autocorrelation function .",
    "it can be evaluated approximately from enskog kinetic theory .",
    "the details will be given elsewhere , and only the result quoted here @xmath112where @xmath113 is the mean free time @xmath114the pressures for the  hard and soft sphere fluids are continuously related for large @xmath1 so both the non - singular part in ( [ 3.17 ] ) and the mean free path should be similar in both cases .",
    "it is easily verified that use of ( [ 3.17 ] ) and ( [ 3.6 ] ) in the green - kubo expression ( [ 3.3 ] ) yields the exact enskog shear viscosity .",
    "both the singular term and the stress auto correlation function contribute at intermediate velocities . in the low density limit the singular contribution to the viscosity vanishes and only the stress autocorrelation function contributes .",
    "also , note that the value at @xmath26 for the hard sphere stress autocorrelation function is finite , in contrast to that for the soft sphere correlation function .",
    "the implications of this for elastic constants will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the hard sphere results suggest how to write an approximate stress autocorrelation function for the soft sphere potential at large @xmath1 .",
    "there should be two contributions with two different time scales .",
    "the first is that which has been determined from the simulations and which yields the singular contribution  in the hard sphere limit .",
    "it also gives entirely the exact short time behavior .",
    "the second term should vanish at short times , but tend toward the form ( [ 3.17 ] ) for @xmath115 .",
    "a simple approximation consistent with the above exact properties and which has the proper hard sphere limit is @xmath116equivalently , the normalized correlation function is@xmath117where @xmath118 is the contribution from the non - singular part @xmath119the function @xmath120 controls the crossover from the time scale @xmath121 to the mean free time scale . for consistency it must be even in time , vanish up through order @xmath122 , and approach unity for large times .",
    "one simple form with these properties is @xmath123    .",
    "[ fig1 ]    .",
    "[ fig2 ]    for illustration , figure 1 shows @xmath124 as a function of @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath100 at the packing fraction @xmath127 .",
    "this is quite similar to the simulation results in figure 5 of reference @xcite .",
    "the small variations with @xmath1 for @xmath128 are due to @xmath118 .",
    "the latter is shown in figure 2 .",

    "becomes@xmath132 \\frac{p^{k}}{g_{\\infty } } \\left ( 1+\\frac{2}{5}\\frac{p - p^{k}}{% p_{k}}\\right ) ^{2}e^{-t/\\tau } .   \\label{3.23}\\]]where the new time scale of the second term is @xmath133the calculation of @xmath134 for all times is still a difficult problem , but one that has been reduced to two particle dynamics .",
    "the remaining terms are all expressed in terms of the pressure .",
    "it should be interesting to see how well ( [ 3.23 ] ) predicts the density dependence of the viscosity for the soft sphere fluid .",
    "on purely physical grounds it is clear that the physical properties of the soft sphere fluid for large @xmath1 should approach those of the hard sphere fluid , in general .",
    "this requires that the continuous newtonian dynamics of the soft sphere fluid must generate the singularities that are inherent in the dynamics of the hard sphere fluid .",
    "the molecular dynamics simulation results of references @xcite provide the first direct demonstration of how such singular properties can be extracted from competition between diverging fluctuations ( the high frequency shear modulus ) and a vanishing collision time .",
    "more generally , the autocorrelation functions for the soft sphere fluid have contributions on two time scales , @xmath10 and @xmath113 . for asymptotically short times",
    "only the former contributes .",
    "there is then a crossover to longer times when the latter dominates . as the density increases",
    ", @xmath113 decreases and if @xmath1 is not large the two times can become comparable and the dynamics is a composition of both . this is the case in figure 2 for @xmath135 .",
    "a reevaluation of the simulation data to extract the non - singular dynamics on the time scale @xmath113 is of some interest and could be compared directly to hard sphere simulations at @xmath45 .",
    "it appears that a recently proposed approximation @xcite to interpolate correlation functions between their exact short time dynamics and long time exponential decay does not work in this case due to the divergent initial value .",
    "similar questions regarding the relationship of hard and soft sphere systems can be raised for the solid state .",
    "the elastic constants are usually related to the stress tensor fluctuations which diverge for the soft sphere fluid but are finite for the hard sphere fluid . to clarify this ,",
    "the exact relations ( [ 3.5a ] ) and ( [ 3.11 ] ) can be combined to give @xmath136 = \\frac{1}{v}\\left\\langle   { \\cal t}_{+xy}\\left ( t\\right ) { \\cal t}_{-xy}\\right\\rangle _ { e }   \\label{4.1}\\]]the right side is finite for @xmath137([3.23 ] ) , which suggests that the proper elastic properties of the soft sphere fluid require subtraction of the short time dynamics with the diverging amplitude .",
    "this can be viewed as an annealing process on the time scale @xmath121 .",
    "the analysis of simulation data for thermal conductivity and bulk viscosity for the soft sphere fluid leads to similar results .",
