    "in this paper we study homoclinic bifurcations in the unfolding of a diffeomorphism near a fixed point of bogdanov - takens type . to begin with , we consider a planar diffeomorphism @xmath0 with the origin as a fixed point and where @xmath1 where @xmath2 is nilpotent .",
    "the origin is said to be a fixed point of _ bogdanov - takens _ type .",
    "this latter terminology is more known for a singularity of a vector field @xmath3 with linear part having double zero eigenvalues and a non vanishing nilpotent part . since this singularity is of codimension 2 , .",
    "i.e. , is twice degenerate , a generic unfolding will depend on two parameters say @xmath4 . in the case of a vector field ,",
    "such unfolding has been studied in @xcite and for maps in @xcite . for completeness , the corresponding bifurcation diagram is revisited in figure 1 on the left : a curve of homoclinic bifurcation emanates from the origin , below a curve of hopf bifurcation , see @xcite for the terminology and more details . for parameters located between these two curves , the corresponding dynamics possesses a stable limit cycle .",
    "finally , for parameter on the ordinate @xmath5 , a saddle node occurs , see also @xcite for more details .",
    "the bogdanov - takens bifurcation plays an important role in dynamical systems , for instance from the bifurcation theoretical point of view .",
    "given any dynamical systems depending on a parameter , the structure of the bifurcation set can be often understood by the presence of several high codimension points which act as organising centres .",
    "knowing the presence of ( degenerate or not degenerate ) bogdanov takens points initiate the searches for subordinate bifurcation sets such as hopf bifurcation sets or homoclinic bifurcation sets . in this paper",
    ", we consider a nondegenerate bogdanov takens point .    for the map @xmath6",
    ", an unfolding theory is developed in @xcite .",
    "it is very similar to the case of a flow . to be more precise , any unfolding @xmath7 of the map @xmath6 ( where @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) can be embedded into a nonautonomous and periodic family of vector fields @xmath10 .",
    "the diffeomorphism coincides with the time 1 map of that vector field , see also @xcite . using an averaging theorem @xcite the dependence on time",
    "is removed to exponentially small terms .",
    "moreover , one can show that @xmath11 is formally interpolated by an autonomous vector field @xmath12 , see @xcite .",
    "this latter can be used to study the bifurcations of fixed points of @xmath11 .",
    "both approaches move the difference between these two types of bifurcations beyond all algebraic order .",
    "although all the taylor coefficients of @xmath13 can be written , there is no reason to expect convergence of the corresponding series , since the dynamics for a planar diffeomorphism can be much richer than the dynamics of a planar vector field . in the real analytic theory , this difference is exponentially small @xcite .",
    "[ fig : bt ]    as we said above , for diffeomorphisms , the bifurcation diagram ( figure 1 , on the right ) is essentially the same .",
    "however , there is no reason to expect a single homoclinic curve , since a homoclinic orbit may be transverse and therefore persists .",
    "we observe a separatrices splitting and instead of a single homoclinic curve , one observes two curves @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively corresponding to the first and the last homoclinic tangency . if a parameter @xmath16 is ( strictly )",
    "located in region between those two curves , then the map @xmath11 possesses transverse homoclinic trajectories . on the lower and upper boundary",
    "the homoclinic connexion becomes non - transverse .",
    "understanding the width of this region is the main goal of this paper .    before going any further , we set the following preliminaries . without lost of generality and up to an analytic change of coordinates one has : @xmath17 where @xmath18 we shall assume that @xmath19 by the implicit function theorem , there exists @xmath20 such that @xmath21 applying a conjugacy of the form @xmath22 ( and after removing the bars ) amounts to writing @xmath23 @xmath24 stands for the higher order terms in @xmath25 and @xmath26 . from ( [ q2 ] ) @xmath27 . by a linear rescaling in the variables @xmath28 , we can fix @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , we put @xmath30 and assume that the map @xmath31 is a local diffeomorphism near @xmath32 . from now on",
    ", we shall consider @xmath33 as our parameters and rename them ( again ) by @xmath4 i.e. , write @xmath34 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that @xmath35 in @xcite the following formula is proposed : @xmath36 where @xmath37{\\mu } } e^{-6\\pi^2{\\tilde \\gamma}/7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is referred to as the ` leading part ' of the width and @xmath38 is an analytic invariant of the map @xmath39 called a ` splitting constant ' , see @xcite .    the goal of this paper is to establish , numerically , a more accurate formula for the width of the homoclinic zone @xmath40 .",
    "the existence of asymptotic expansions for the width of the homoclinic zone is unknown so far .",
    "furthermore , if it does exist , it is very hard to compute analytically .",
    "the difficulty here comes from the fact that the normal form of the map coincides with that of the time 1-map of a vector field .",
    "therefore the difference between the flow and the map is pushed beyond any algebraic order . in the nearly integrable context , a polynomial asymptotic expansion for the splitting of the separatrices is proposed in @xcite : the author considers the perturbation of a hamiltonian ( elliptic ) billiard .",
    "the system depends on a perturbation parameter @xmath41 , a hyperbolicity parameter @xmath42 and admits four separatrices , which break up when @xmath43 . in this special case ,",
    "the author proposed an asymptotic expansion for the area of the main lobes of the resulting turnstile that takes the form of a power series ( with even terms ) in @xmath44 .",
    "see @xcite for more references on the computation of separatrices splitting .    in this paper",
    "our approach is somehow experimental .",
    "we study examples and present strong numerical evidence for the following expansion of the width of the homoclinic zone @xmath45}{\\tilde c}_{k , j}\\mu^{k/4}\\log^{j } \\mu\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 $ ] stands for the integer part of @xmath47 and @xmath48 is given by ( [ kmugamma ] ) .",
    "* remarks * :    \\(a ) observe that ( [ teo ] ) is a double series with logarithmic terms and numerically , for such an expansion , we do not know any efficient techniques to compute the corresponding coefficients with a large precision .",
    "however , our numerical experiments showed that @xmath49 has a simpler asymptotics expansion .",
    "than @xmath50 itself .",
    "more precisely we have @xmath51 one easily checks that formula ( [ teo ] ) follows from ( [ teo - log ] ) and that the @xmath52 s depend on the @xmath53 s and the @xmath54 s .",
    "note that the asymptotic series ( [ teo - log ] ) does not involve a double summation and therefore the corresponding coefficients can be computed with a much higher precision .",
    "\\(b ) logarithmic terms may vanish , this occurs for instance in the case of the hnon map , see next section for more details .",
    "\\(c ) from the numerical data , we are able to guess a simple analytic expression for the first logarithmic term in ( [ teo - log ] ) .",
    "more precisely we have @xmath55 which is valid for all families studied in this article .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we shall consider three different families that satisfy , ( up to appropriate smooth changes of coordinates ) the setting above with different non linear terms . as a result of our experiments , for each family we shall state the asymptotics for the width of the homoclinic zone , confirming formula ( [ teo - log ] ) .",
    "looking for the width of the homoclinic zone amounts to fixing one parameter , say @xmath56 in the unfolding ( [ unfold ] ) , and find the values of the second parameter , say @xmath57 , for which the system admits a first and a last homoclinic tangency .",
    "we say that @xmath56 is the main ` parameter ' and @xmath57 is the ` slave ' parameter . in section 3",
    "we briefly present the strategy to follow .",
    "the rest of the section is devoted to the computation of the invariant ( stable and unstable ) manifolds at the saddle point .",
    "the _ splitting function _ which is a key ingredient of the techniques is presented . indeed , primary homoclinic orbits are in one to one correspondence with zeroes of the splitting function .",
    "therefore , the first and the last homoclinic tangencies will correspond to double zeroes of the splitting functions .",
    "moreover , the splitting function is periodic , with exponentially decreasing harmonics and is well approximated by the _ splitting determinant_. with a good precision , computing the width of the zone amounts to the computation of the first two harmonics of the splitting function and their dependence with respect to the slave parameter ( the main parameter being fixed ) . for each family , we compute the width of the homoclinic zone for several hundreds values of the main parameter @xmath56 and collect the results in a set of renormalised data . in the next step , the coefficients in ( [ teo - log ] ) ( considered as an ansatz ) are extracted by interpolation techniques .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is devoted to the verification of the validity of our results .",
    "more precisely , we test the ansatz ( [ teo - log ] ) and we find how precise our data for the width of the homoclinic zone should be in order to produce reliable results for the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion",
    ". finally , the constant coefficient of the expansion should coincide with the splitting constant @xcite : following the procedure developed in @xcite , we compare these constants with the constant coefficients of the expansions .",
    "before presenting our main results , we first introduce the following notions .",
    "let @xmath58 be given and let @xmath59 where @xmath60 and for each integer @xmath61 , @xmath62 is a smooth positive function such that @xmath63 or in other words @xmath64 .",
    "such a family @xmath65 is called an _ asymptotic sequence_. in this paper we shall consider the following asymptotic sequences @xmath66 that is @xmath67 and the dulac asymptotic sequence @xcite : @xmath68 that is for all integer @xmath69",
    "@xmath70    let @xmath71 be a smooth function .",
    "we say that @xmath72 is an asymptotic expansion of @xmath73 at @xmath74 ( where the @xmath75 is an asymptotic sequence and all @xmath76 s are real ) if for all integer @xmath77 ,          our first example is the quadratic map @xmath81 observe that @xmath82 mimics the unfolding ( [ unf ] ) i.e. , that takes the form of @xmath83 and ignores the higher order terms .",
    "we normalise the width of the homoclinic zone associated to the quadratic family by defining @xmath84 within precision of our computations we observe @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are real coefficients which depend on the parameter @xmath88 . comparing with ( [ gelf ] )",
    ", we see that @xmath89 is the splitting constant associated with @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , as we announced in the previous section , we have @xmath91 for each value of @xmath88 , the @xmath92 s and @xmath93 s can be computed with a very high precision , see table 1 for illustration .",
    "formula ( [ s - r - diverge ] ) is verified for the 76 first coeficients : @xmath92 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "although the precision decreases almost linearly as @xmath97 and @xmath98 increase , the 76 first coefficients can be computed with 60 correct digits . to compute these first coeficients , we need to compute the width of the homoclinic zone with at least 200 correct digits , see section 4.2 for more details",
    "our second example is the bogdanov map @xcite .",
    "@xmath100 the bogdanov map , see for example @xcite , is the euler map of a two - dimensional system of ordinary differential equations . in @xcite",
    "arrowsmith studied the bifurcations and basins of attraction and showed the existence of mode locking , arnold tongues , and chaos , see also @xcite for more details .    for this map the saddle point is located at the origin .",
    "this map can be transformed to the form ( [ unfold ] ) .",
    "indeed , let @xmath101 we retrieve the map ( 2 ) and higher order terms ( [ unfold ] ) by putting @xmath102 and @xmath103 the parameter @xmath104 is chosen to be the main parameter and @xmath105 the slave parameter . from ( [ homo - line ] ) ,",
    "the bogdanov map admits a homoclinic zone near the line @xmath106 the normalised width takes the form @xmath107 similarly to the quadratic family , our experiments showed that @xmath108 satisfies the following asymptotics : @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are real coefficients which depend on the parameter @xmath88 . comparing with ( [ gelf ] ) , we see that @xmath112 is the splitting constant associated with @xmath113 .",
    "moreover , we observe numerically that @xmath114 .    in table 1",
    ", we provide typical results for our computation for the quadratic and bogdanov maps .",
    "although the first 20 coefficients do not show a tendency to grow rapidly , we conjecture the series ( [ s - r - diverge ] ) and ( [ bog - diverge - henon ] ) diverge and belong to the gevrey-1 class ( [ gevrey ] ) , compare with @xcite .",
    ".the 20 first coefficients of the asymptotic expansion for the bogdanov map ( left , @xmath115 ) and the quadratic map ( right , @xmath116 ) .",
