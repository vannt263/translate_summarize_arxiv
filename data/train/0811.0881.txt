    "adiabatic quantum annealing ( aqa ) @xcite-@xcite is a method of finding the ground state ( minimum energy state ) of a given classical hamiltonian by employing external quantum fluctuations and subsequent adiabatic reduction of them .",
    "one is given with a classical hamiltonian @xmath0 , which may be a physical hamiltonian with many degrees of freedom , or a suitable mathematical function depending on many variables , and the task is to determine its global minimum . in order to introduce the quantum fluctuations necessary for the aqa of such a hamiltonian ,",
    "one adds a quantum kinetic part @xmath1 to it , such that @xmath1 and @xmath0 do not commute .",
    "initially , one keeps @xmath2 so that the total hamiltonian @xmath3 is well approximated by the kinetic part only ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "if the system is initially prepared to be in the ground state of @xmath5 ( one chooses @xmath5 to have a easily realizable ground state ) and @xmath1 is reduced slowly enough , then according to the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics , the overlap @xmath6 , between the instantaneous lowest - eigenvalue state @xmath7 and the instantaneous state of @xmath8 of the evolving system , will always stay near its initial value ( which is close to unity , since @xmath4 ) .",
    "hence at the end of such an evolution , when @xmath1 is reduced to zero at @xmath9 ( the annealing time ) , the system will be found in a state @xmath10 with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the ground state of @xmath13 , which is nothing but the surviving classical part @xmath0 .",
    "thus at the end of an adiabatic annealing the system is found in the ground state of the classical hamiltonian with a high probability .",
    "based on this principle , algorithms can be framed to anneal complex physical systems like spin glasses as well as the objective functions of hard combinatorial optimization problems ( like the traveling salesman problem ) , towards their ground ( optimal ) states @xcite .    in order to ensure adiabaticity",
    ", the evolution should be such that @xmath14 where @xmath15 \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta^2_{min } & = & \\min_{0 \\le s \\le 1}\\left [ \\delta^2(s)\\right];\\quad s = t/\\tau ; \\quad 0\\le s \\le 1 , \\label{adia - factors}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath16 being the instantaneous first excited state of the total hamiltonian @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the instantaneous gap between the ground state and the first excited state energies and @xmath19 being the adiabatic factor ( for a simple proof see @xcite )",
    ".    one key feature , believed to be behind the success of aqa over the classical ones @xcite in glass - like rugged pel , is the ability of the quantum systems to tunnel easily through potential energy barriers even if they are very high , provided they are narrow enough , in contrast to the the classical ones , which always has to scale the barrier height with its kinetic energy ( temperature ) irrespective of the width @xcite . here",
    "we show that there is another aspect which makes a quantum mechanical searcher more advantagous over the classical ones- it can utilize the depth of the potential energy minimum in locating it in absence of any potential gradient which a classical searcher can not .",
    "we consider a lattice with @xmath20 sites , @xmath21 denoting the state of a particle localized at the @xmath22-th site . at each site",
    ", there is a potential , which is zero at all the sites @xmath23 , and is @xmath24 at @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is chosen randomly .",
    "thus the pel is essentially a flat one without any gradient , with a single hole ( minimum ) at @xmath27 with a depth @xmath28 .",
    "this is precisely some kind of analog version of grover s algorithm for searching a particular entry in an unstructured database @xcite - @xcite .",
    "but in those studies , the possibility of utilizing the depth of the hole in favor of faster search was not considered , and the gain over the classical ones is limited by the optimal grover s bound of @xmath29 speed - up @xcite .",
    "let us consider that the lattice points are connected to each other by an infinite range hopping term @xmath30 between any two sites .",
    "the question is how fast a particle can locate the hole starting from a state which does not assume any knowledge of the position of the hole , by reducing its kinetic energy @xmath30 , and tuning the hole depth @xmath28 .",
    "the hamiltonian for a particle on such a lattice will be given by- @xmath31 in order to anneal the particle to the hole , one has to reduce @xmath30 from a very high value to a very low final value and tune @xmath28 in the opposite manner , so that @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the annealing time .",
    "the evolution should satisfy the adiabatic condition ( [ adia - cond ] ) .",
    "the eigen - spectrum of @xmath17 consists of a ground state @xmath7 and first excited state @xmath16 ( in the order of increasing eigen values ) with energies @xmath35   \\label{eigenvalues}\\ ] ] respectively , all the time dependencies being implicit , through the time dependence of @xmath30 and @xmath28 .",
    "the instantaneous gap is thus given by @xmath36 the instantaneous first and second excited states @xmath37 are given by - @xmath38 ,   \\label{eigenstts}\\ ] ] where @xmath39   % s_{\\pm}(t ) & = & \\sqrt{c_{\\pm}^{2}(t ) + n - 1 } \\label{coeffs}\\ ] ] the second excited state is @xmath40-fold degenerate , with eigenvalue @xmath41 , and the time evolving hamiltonian never mixes the first two eigenstate with any of the second excited states .",
    "this can be easily argued noting that a state of the form @xmath42 @xmath43 is an eigenstate of @xmath17 with eigenvalue @xmath41 , and @xmath44 for all @xmath45 .",
    "for all allowed combinations of @xmath22 and @xmath46 we get @xmath40 such linearly - independent eigenstates .",
    "form these @xmath40 linearly - independent eigenstates we can construct @xmath40 mutually orthogonal eigenstates , each of which will obviously satisfy the above non - mixing condition .",
    "thus we have to take care of only two lowest lying states and the gap between them .",
    "henceforth we will consider only the large @xmath20 limits , and replace @xmath47 by @xmath48 when the correction will vanish in the said limit .    in investigating the condition of adiabatic evolution we consider two separate cases .",
    "in general , in a quantum annealing program , one might not have the facility of tuning both the potential energy part and the kinetic part in practice , since , say , one might depend on the strength of interactions between the elementary constituents ( hard to tune ) , while the other might be introduced through an applied external field ( easily tunable ) . hence in our analysis",
    "we have considered two separate cases - in the first case we tune @xmath28 keeping @xmath30 constant , while in the second case we do the reverse .",
    "we start with the initial state @xmath49 ( which is of course the ground state of @xmath50 ) and adopt a linear annealing schedule : @xmath51 here @xmath52 is an arbitrary factor which might also depend on @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath30 is kept constant , we have to keep it sufficiently low ( or , in other words , @xmath53 sufficiently high ) , so that the ground state of @xmath54 has a substantial ( non - vanishing in the @xmath55 limit ) overlap with @xmath56 . at @xmath9 , we get from eq .",
    "( [ coeffs ] ) , the amplitude of @xmath56 in the final ground state to be @xmath57 , where @xmath58 clearly , if @xmath59 , then the amplitude @xmath60 , and thus the overlap amplitude @xmath61 , whereas if @xmath62 , then @xmath63 , and the amplitude vanishes as @xmath55 .",
    "thus to be able to locate the hole at the end , we have to take @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , the adiabatic factor in that case ( @xmath59 ) is given by @xmath64 this has its maximum at @xmath65 , and the maximum value is given by @xmath66 this clearly shows that if the hole - depth @xmath53 scales linearly with the size @xmath20 of the search space ( i.e. , @xmath52 is independent of @xmath20 ) , the search can be completed in a time independent of @xmath20 .",
    "we calculated numerically the minimum time @xmath67 required for obtaining a targeted succes probability @xmath68 for different @xmath20 , through many decades .",
    "the evolution is computed solving time - dependent schrdinger equation numerically and @xmath67 is figured out up to an accuracy of @xmath69 employing the following bisection scheme .",
    "we first figure out arbitrarily a high value of @xmath34 ( call it @xmath70 ) for which @xmath71 .",
    "next we find a low @xmath34 ( @xmath72 ) , for which @xmath73",
    ". then we evaluate @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "if the result is greater than @xmath76 , then we replace @xmath70 by @xmath77 ( and retain old @xmath72 ) , else we replace @xmath72 by @xmath77 ( and retain old @xmath70 ) and repeat the same process .",
    "we go on iterating until the the value of @xmath78 for both @xmath70 and @xmath72 lies within some desired accuracy limit .",
    "the results ( fig .",
    "[ qan]a ) clearly show that @xmath74 becomes independent of @xmath20 for large @xmath20 , as expected .",
    "the relaxation behavior for large @xmath20 for a given annealing time @xmath34 of course depends on the value of @xmath79 ( see fig . [",
    "if @xmath79 is too small , the system takes a longer time to feel the changes in the landscape , and hence the adiabatic relaxation requires longer time ( the adiabatic factor becomes bigger ; see eq .",
    "[ constg - af - max ] ) . on the other hand , if @xmath79 is too large , the ground state itself is pretty delocalized , and hence the final state , though more closer to the ground state , has again a small overlap with the target state @xmath56 . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the schedule is found to be optimal ( fig . [ qan](b ) ) .",
    "the relaxation behavior is seen to be linear with the annealing time @xmath34 for large @xmath34 .",
    "next , we consider the case where @xmath28 is kept fixed and @xmath30 is reduced linearly , i.e. , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in this case , we start with the same democratic initial state @xmath83 as in the previous case , which is not of course the ground state in presence of the hole ( we can not construct the actual initial ground state without the explicit knowledge of the location of the hole ) .",
    "all we need to show in this case , is that it has a non - vanishing ( i.e. , non - zero in the @xmath55 limit ) overlap @xmath84 between our initial state and the true ground state at @xmath85 . if we can assure adiabaticity for the subsequent evolution , this overlap will be conserved and would emerge as the final overlap between @xmath10 and @xmath56 .",
    "calculation similar to that of the previous section shows that , for @xmath62 , @xmath86 as @xmath55 , implying that the overlap actually tends to unity in that limit , while it vanishes for @xmath59 .",
    "the adiabatic factor in the former case @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 which is again a constant independent of @xmath20 , if @xmath52 is @xmath20-independent ( i.e. , @xmath53 is linear in @xmath20 ) .",
    "we present a similar numerical calculation , as in the previous section , for the variation of @xmath67 with @xmath20 in fig .",
    "( [ constchi ] ) .",
    "it shows that the value of @xmath67 becomes independent of @xmath20 in the large-@xmath20 limit ( its asymptotic value , however depends on @xmath79 ) .",
    "let us concentrate on the rather interesting case of @xmath20-independent @xmath52 .",
    "the expression for the gap @xmath89 ( eq . [ gap ] ) shows that the gap scales linearly with @xmath20 everywhere except at the point @xmath90 where it scales as @xmath91 . in our notation",
    ", this happens at the instant @xmath92 in the case of constant-@xmath30 annealing , and at @xmath93 in the constant-@xmath28 case . for successful",
    "annealing one can not avoid this point during the evolution in both cases . to see what happens at that point , let us focus on the amplitude @xmath94 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "let us consider , say , the @xmath30-constant annealing case .",
    "we have from eq .",
    "( [ coeffs ] ) , @xmath97 . taking the modulus into account",
    ", one finds @xmath98 for @xmath99 ( which means the amplitude vanishes ) , while @xmath100 for @xmath101 ( the amplitude tends to unity ) .",
    "this means the ground state of @xmath102 undergoes a global change in character from a completely delocalized one to a completely localized one at this special point .",
    "thus , to follow the ground state , a lot of tunneling from all the sites to the hole is required at the point . here the depth of the hole plays a crucial role in making this tunneling possible preventing the gap @xmath89 from closing at the transition point .",
    "if however , the system passes this point very fast , this massive tunneling might remain incomplete and a resultant loss in the adiabaticity may occur .",
    "similar argument holds for the @xmath28-constant annealing .",
    "if instead of the hamiltonian we considered , one takes a bounded version of it ( energy not growing with @xmath20 ) , say , by keeping @xmath28 independent of @xmath20 and scaling @xmath79 by @xmath20 , then one can easily see that this special transition point would behave like a true quantum critical point with the gap vanishing as @xmath103 @xcite . the two states- the one localized at the hole and the other delocalized over the entire lattice , have exactly equal energies at this ",
    "critical \" point as the gap closes .",
    "but before reaching that point ( i.e. , in the kinetic energy dominated region ) , the ground state is non - degenerate and delocalized , while after the point ( i.e. , in the potential energy dominated region ) the ground state is degenerate and localized at the hole .",
    "since there is no energy difference between the two states ( the localized and the delocalized ones ) at the critical point , the evolving system can not sense the global exchange of character between the ground state and the first excited state at this point and thus fails to adopt ( tunnel ) accordingly to follow the ground state .",
    "letting the hole scale linearly with @xmath20 and taking infinite range hopping , one prevents the gap from closing , and thus favors the localized state energetically over the delocalized one at the transition point .",
    "this acts as a drive for the necessary tunneling and thus provides a guidance for the system to follow the ground state as it changes its global character .",
    "however , it is also worth noting that increasing the hole - depth @xmath53 indiscriminately does not pay . in the case of constant-@xmath30 annealing ,",
    "the adiabatic factor increases with @xmath52 ( eq.[constg - af - max ] ) , which means we have to keep @xmath52 as small as possible , i.e. , @xmath104 gives the best result .",
    "this can be explained by noting that a larger @xmath53 would demand a slower rate of evolution if adiabaticity is to be ensured . in the constant-@xmath28 case ,",
    "adiabatic factor decreases with @xmath52 , but one has to keep @xmath62 , which means @xmath28 can be increased only linearly with @xmath20 , up to the upper limit @xmath105 in order to accelerate the annealing effectively .",
    "this is because , too big @xmath53 implies too much error in the initial state and the overlap is negligible right from the onset . hence even with a perfectly adiabatic evolution we end up with the negligible overlap .    to summarize , we studied the adiabatic searching of a gradient - free potential energy landscape on a lattice with a randomly placed single isolated minimum ( hole ) by a quantum searcher .",
    "we have found that the depth of the hole plays a non - classical role in accelerating the search .",
    "this is because the delocalized wave - function of the quantum adiabatic searcher can detect the hole from the very onset of the search and keep track of it , in contrast to a classical searcher , who of course can not sense the hole depth non - locally and utilize it .",
    "we found that the condition for adiabatic search requires an infinite - range hopping between the points in the pel and the depth of the hole to scale linearly with the lattice - size @xmath20 .",
    "we have discussed how the hole - depth plays a role in preventing the closure of the gap and the consequent divergence of the searching time .    * * + the author is thankful to b. k. chakrabarti , g. e. santoro and e. tosatti for useful discussions .",
