    "one can see nonmonotonic dependence @xmath230 , that first increases rapidly , reaches a maximum and then decreases slowly .",
    "another remarkable feature is proportionality of @xmath231 to @xmath200 up to @xmath232 oe ( 0.5@xmath202 tilt ) , which is seen from an almost ideal collapse of the @xmath228 curves at different tilt angles .",
    "figure [ fig : mesa1hz40_5oe ] shows the i - v dependences of the mesa # 1 for two values of the in - plane field , @xmath216 t and @xmath210 t , and for very close values of c - axis field , @xmath233oe .",
    "we can see that for @xmath215 t the amplitude of the excess current is more than four times smaller than for @xmath216 t , which is consistent with the theoretical estimates .",
    "figure [ fig : ivstempcompare ] illustrates the temperature dependence of the excess current for the mesa # 2 .",
    "we can see that at lower temperatures maximum in the excess current increases and moves to the lower voltages .",
    "we also note that for the overdoped mesa the excess pv current density is 4 - 5 times larger than for the underdoped one .",
    "figure [ fig : dicomp03degtemp ] shows comparison of the pv - induced damping for the mesa # 2 before and after irradiation for three temperatures , 40k , 50k , and 60k .",
    "it is interesting to note that _ the columnar defects induced by heavy - ion irradiation have negligible direct influence on dynamics of jv lattice _",
    "( ivs at @xmath218 tilt angles are not noticeably influenced by the irradiation ) . on the other hand",
    ", they strongly influence the pv - induced damping at low temperatures .",
    "we can see that at 40k and 50k pinning of the pv stacks by the columnar defects almost completely eliminates the pv extra damping . at 60 k this damping",
    "is restored most probably due to the thermal depinning of the pv stacks from the columns .",
    "this behavior is consistent with location of the thermal depinning temperature @xmath176 evaluated in sec.[sec : coldef ] ( for underdoped bscco we estimated @xmath234k ) .",
    "strong dynamic interaction of the jvs with the pv stacks leads to a very high sensitivity of the jv transport to a very small concentration of the pv stacks which we observed experimentally . at a given driving force ( or dc current )",
    "that interaction slows down the jv lattice and thus reduces the jff voltage leading to the pronounced negative jff magnetoresistance with respect to the _",
    "c_-axis component of the magnetic field . on the other hand , at a given voltage",
    "the extra damping due to the pv stacks results in increase of the current . theoretical description of these effects is based on calculation of the oscillating zigzag deformations of the pv stacks induced by the moving jv lattice and the average friction force due to these deformations .",
    "several features of the experimental pv excess current , such as its nonmonotonic dependence on voltage , its decrease with increasing temperature and the in - plane field , are in a good _ qualitative _ agreement with the theory .",
    "a strong suppression of the pv damping by columnar defects also provides confirmation for suggested mechanism .",
    "a detailed _ quantitative _ comparison between the experiment and theory requires an accurate knowledge of the microscopic parameters of superconductor , london penetration depth , @xmath235 , anisotropy @xmath3 , and pancake flux - flow resistivity @xmath236 , as well as geometrical parameters of the mesas .    to estimate the key theoretical parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 we need values of the magnetic spring constant @xmath237 and the pv viscosity coefficient , @xmath58 .",
    "the magnetic spring constant is mainly determined by the london penetration depth .",
    "for example , taking a value @xmath238 nm typical for overdoped bscco at @xmath239k , we obtain @xmath240n / m@xmath241 and @xmath242 g .",
    "the value of the viscosity coefficient is more uncertain . to our knowledge",
    "no direct transport measurement of the pv flux - flow resistivity in bscco has been published .",
    "microwave measurements of the flux - flow resistivity in single crystals ( at 40.8 ghz ) @xcite and films ( at 48 ghz ) @xcite show that @xmath243 has strong temperature dependence and suggest a typical value for @xmath244k , @xmath245@xmath246@xmath247-@xmath248n s / m@xmath241 corresponding to the slope @xmath249-@xmath250 @xmath251 cm / tesla .",
    "this gives the following estimate for the flux flow - conductivity at @xmath252 , @xmath253@xmath7@xmath254-@xmath255[@xmath256cm]@xmath257 .",
    "these data suggest that the maximum pv effect is expected at very small voltage , @xmath258-@xmath259v .",
    "experimentally , the maximum excess current is observed at significantly higher voltages , @xmath260-@xmath261v corresponding to relaxation frequencies 7 - 15 ghz . also , the simple theory does not quite describe shapes of the experimental @xmath262 dependences , at @xmath263 the excess current decreases slower than expected @xmath264 decay . on the other hand",
    ", we found that shapes of @xmath230 dependences also somewhat differ for underdoped and overdoped mesas .",
    "these discrepancies can be explained if we ( i)assume small - velocity value for the viscosity constant , @xmath265n s / m@xmath266 , which is significantly larger than the microwave measurements suggest , and ( ii)assume that it decreases with increasing pv velocity . in the temperature and in - plane field region probed in experiment influence of thermal fluctuation pv s considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : pvfluct ] is significant .",
    "for example , for the overdoped mesa at 65 k , we estimate @xmath267-@xmath268 and the reduced temperature given by eq .",
    "( [ redt ] ) as @xmath269 for @xmath270 t and @xmath271 for @xmath272 t .",
    "shape deviations , at least partly , can be due to the pv thermal fluctuations .",
    "our calculations show that the pv fluctuations mainly reduce the amplitude of @xmath231 and somewhat weaken the dependence @xmath230 at large @xmath229 but they do not shift much the maximum of the @xmath230 dependence .",
    "another possible reason for disagreement with the simple theoretical picture is that at small velocities the jv lattice may move inhomogeneously , via thermally - activated jumps .",
    "this regime of motion is not considered by the theory at all and it may lead to an increase of apparent @xmath273 . we expect that this inhomogeneous regime is more pronounced for smaller sample sizes in which averaging over pv locations is incomplete .",
    "therefore , a systematic size dependence of the effect would help to understand mechanism of the low - voltage regime .",
    "note that , due to a very small value of @xmath78 , without scrutinizing i - v shape , the low - voltage enhancement of damping can be easily misinterpreted as an enhancement of the critical current . in our experiments ,",
    "a detailed study of the small - voltage region shows that the jv lattice slowly moves below the maximum current meaning that this maximum is due to the enhancement of damping .",
    "this , of course , does not exclude possibility that in other experimental conditions ( e.g. , at low temperatures ) the main pv effect would be enhancement of the critical current .",
    "an extreme sensitivity of the jv flux - flow voltage to a very small concentration of the pvs suggests a very attractive possibility to use small - size mesas for detection of penetration of individual pv stacks which will be seen as current or voltage jumps .",
    "the change of the total current due to the penetration event of a single pv stack , @xmath274 , is expected to be independent on the mesa size and is given by @xmath275 its maximum value , @xmath276 , is realized at @xmath277 and at low temperatures , where thermal - fluctuation suppression is small , can be estimated as @xmath278 taking @xmath279a / cm@xmath241 , @xmath281 nm , and @xmath282 , we estimate @xmath283a . on the other hand , for the underdoped mesa # 2 at 50k from fig .",
    "[ fig : djhzscaling ] we obtain @xmath284a consistent with the above theoretical estimate . for the overdoped mesa @xmath276",
    "is 4 - 5 times larger .",
    "such currents are detectable experimentally .",
    "we conclude that this technique can be practically used for detection of the individual pv stacks penetration .",
