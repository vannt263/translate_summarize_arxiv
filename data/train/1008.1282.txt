    "essential to this monopole search is a reliable simulation of in - ice showers caused by monopoles traversing the ice sheet .",
    "our model of monopole energy loss is based on the muon / tau energy loss model of dutta _ _ et al.__@xcite . in this model ,",
    "energy loss by a muon traversing a medium is expressed as @xmath23 the @xmath24 term is the energy loss per distance due to ionization of the medium .",
    "the @xmath25 term@xcite is the sum of three terms reflecting bremsstrahlung , pair production , and photonuclear effect energy losses .",
    "the values of @xmath24 and of the various contributions to @xmath25 are only weakly @xmath1 dependent .",
    "although energy loss due to ionization can be treated as smooth and continuous with little loss of accuracy , the stochastic fluctuations in pair production and photonuclear energy losses must be explicitly modeled ; such discrete processes , in fact , provide the catastrophic showers to which anita - ii is most sensitive .",
    "the dutta _",
    "_ model expresses these energy losses in terms of partial interaction cross sections with respect to interaction energy , making it possible to isolate the expectation number of particle / medium interactions at a given energy and replace it with a random number of interactions drawn from the appropriate poisson distribution . to convert the stochastic model of muon energy loss to a model of magnetic monopole energy loss , the muon mass",
    "must first be replaced by the magnetic monopole mass . for monopoles ,",
    "bremsstrahlung is negligible and is disregarded@xcite .",
    "next , due to dirac s quantization condition , a magnetic monopole of 1 dirac charge will lose energy equivalent to an electric charge of @xmath26 times the proton charge@xcite . accounting for this large effective charge only requires multiplying the expectation number of interactions by @xmath27 .",
    "figure [ monobyparts ] shows various contributions to the energy loss of a @xmath17 gev monopole .",
    "( the monopole rest mass is constrained to vary inversely with gamma such that total energy is fixed at the reference energy of @xmath17 gev . )",
    "the curves indicate average energy loss due to the three principal mechanisms , while the points show actual stochastic energy loss ( as averaged over a 50 m interval in our simulation ) .",
    "the photonuclear effect is the dominant energy loss mechanism at @xmath28 , while ionization energy losses dominate below this value .",
    "because the photonuclear mechanism results in hadronic showers generated by nuclear recoils , we may ignore landau - migdal - pomeranchuk ( lpm)@xcite effects .     for @xmath17 gev monopoles , showing stochastic variation averaged over 50 m intervals .",
    "lines show average contributions from different processes.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the monopole energy loss model described above has been incorporated into a monte carlo simulation of a magnetic monopole traveling within the ice volume visible to anita .",
    "the monte carlo simulation randomly generates a monopole trajectory ( uniform over @xmath29 ) and energy loss according to the previously described model , then determines the voltage response of each of the anita antennas which participate in the event trigger , as summarized below and elsewhere .",
    "earth curvature effects , which are considerable at the largest radii ( @xmath19600 km ) , are incorporated into the model by a suitable adjustment of the refracted ray geometry , relative to the balloon , for a given source location .",
    "as can be inferred from figure [ monobyparts ] , a down - coming monopole having @xmath30 will easily traverse the entirety of the antarctic ice sheet without substantial degradation of energy , whereas a normally - incident up - coming monopole at those @xmath1 values will typically range out in the earth before reaching the south pole .",
    "upcoming monopoles with larger @xmath1 values will generally reach the detector , although their energy loss in - transit through the earth can be substantial . for calculating this energy loss , the terrestrial density integrated over the length of the monopole s path [ g/@xmath31 , as a function of approach angle ,",
    "is taken from the preliminary reference earth model@xcite .",
    "after calculating the energy lost by a monopole en route to the ice target ( zero if the monopole arrives from above ) , the monopole s interaction with the ice itself is simulated , over discrete step sizes of 15 cm .",
    "this selection of step size is motivated by several considerations : a ) the time delay between signals received at the ends of the step should be smaller than the time scale of the trigger logic , which is determined by the 7 ns duration of the front - end tunnel - diode signal integration , b ) the time delay between successive steps should not be larger than the anita digitization time of 0.4 ns , c ) the steps should not be so fine that the simulation processing time ( and array sizes ) become prohibitive .",
    "for the most unfavorable geometry ( a shower receding from anita along the line - of - sight ) , the time delay between successive steps is the sum of the time for the monopole to move 15 cm in ice plus the additional signal transit time in - air , or approximately 1 ns .",
    "however , this geometry results in a cherenkov pattern undetectable at the payload  similarly , monopoles entering the ice at normal incidence from above ( @xmath32 ) do not illuminate the balloon . signals typically result when an up - coming monopole transits from rock to ice or a down - coming monopole approaching the balloon is incident on the air - ice interface from above at a near - glancing angle , as illustrated in figure [ fig : mono.xfig.eps ] . at the cherenkov angle of approximately 1 radian , the latter results in zero time delay between successive steps , growing as the azimuthal angle relative to the balloon increases from zero .",
    "the former results in a maximum time delay of approximately one time bin between successive steps .",
    "the geometric aperture of anita to monopoles traversing the ice can be crudely estimated as follows . for a cherenkov cone developing in the ice , the solid angle illuminating",
    "the balloon is approximately the product of the vertical width in @xmath22 ( @xmath330.2 rads at the lowest frequencies accessible to anita ) times the horizontal width in @xmath21 ( @xmath340.5 rads ) , giving a maximum geometric acceptance of @xmath35 , or approximately 1% .",
    "this provides the greatest limitation on anita s sensitivity to monopole signals .",
    "ice ) or below ( rock@xmath36ice ) illuminating anita .",
    "red / pink arrows indicate monopole trajectories which can result in a significant signal measured at the balloon . for isotropic monopole flux , the fraction of monopoles satisfying this geometry is of order @xmath191% .",
    "( for the sake of illustration , ray curvature through the firn has been neglected , although this feature is incorporated into our simulation.),scaledwidth=50.0% ]      a monte carlo simulation of the radio frequency signals caused by cascades ( discussed in ref.@xcite ) previously developed in the context of rice s high - energy neutrino flux studies has been adapted for application to anita .",
    "in addition to the stochastic energy loss processes enumerated previously , we also simulate ray - tracing through the firn , as well as signal loss in transmission across the snow surface into the air , as a function of incident angle on the ice - air interface .",
    "a typical example of a simulated monopole time - domain voltage profile , for a monopole simulated at @xmath37 , is shown in figure [ voltgraph ] .",
    "in contrast to temporally compact showers from neutrinos , monopoles deposit energy over a timescale considerably longer than the minimum @xmath19400 ns time required to fill four available data acquisition event buffers .",
    "schematically , the monopole signal can be treated as a sequence of ` subshowers ' , each having a characteristic energy deposition geometry and time delay relative to anita . as demonstrated by laboratory measurements@xcite ,",
    "the frequency - domain radio wave signal due to a shower in a dense medium is typically broad and , in contrast to typical narrow - band anthropogenic backgrounds , extends over hundreds of mhz .",
    "the complete simulated voltage profile @xmath38 at each antenna is determined by coherently summing the voltage contributions of various subshowers in each time bin .",
    "the signal phase at the emission point will vary slowly with viewing angle@xcite ; however , in most cases the dominant emission arises from a coherent region along the track centered around the cherenkov point and subtending a small viewing angle . accordingly",
    ", we ignore all signal phases other than those from travel time in our analysis .",
    "similar to showers from neutrinos , the signal strength is typically at least an order of magnitude stronger along the vertical polarization ( vpol ) axis compared to the horizontal polarization axis , given the excellent cross - polarization isolation ( @xmath1920 db ) of the seavey antennas .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      the heirarchical anita - ii trigger allows a relatively low neutrino detection trigger threshold , while maintaining a tolerable ( @xmath19hz ) thermal noise data rate written to disk .",
    "in contrast to anita - i , only signals from the vpol channel of the dual - polarization horn antennas contribute to the anita - ii trigger .",
    "following the antenna , signals routed through the ` trigger ' ( vs. ` digitization ' ) path are tested for their spectral power in four frequency bands , approximately covering the intervals ( in mhz ) 200@xmath36350 , 330@xmath36600 , 630@xmath361100 and 150@xmath361240 , respectively .",
    "this partitioning is performed in order to provide rejection power against narrow - bandwidth anthropogenic backgrounds , while retaining high efficiency for sharp duration ( temporally ) , large - bandwidth neutrino signals .",
    "the frequency - banded signals are then passed through a tunnel - diode , which integrates roughly 7-ns units of data and provides a unipolar ( negative ) output pulse .",
    "the lowest - level trigger ( l0 ) requires signal in one of the four frequency bands at a level exceeding approximately 2.3@xmath39 , with @xmath39 the rms of the typical tunnel - diode output voltage at this point .",
    "the l1 trigger required two of the three frequency bands plus a full - band trigger within a 10 ns window .",
    "( in an improvement over anita-1 , the different group delays of the bandpass filters from the single - band stage were compensated digitally to ensure synchronization . )",
    "the l1 triggers were then combined for the l2 trigger stage . for the upper and lower antennas ,",
    "an l2 was issued in one of the 16 phi sectors when two of the three antennas either on or adjacent to that phi sector triggered within approximately 10 ns of each other . for phi sectors containing a nadir antenna , an l2",
    "was issued for each l1 , and for those without , an l2 was issued when either adjacent nadir antenna received an l1 .",
    "finally , the fourth ( l3 ) stage required two of the three antenna rings ( upper , lower , and nadir ) to have an l2 trigger within approximately 10 ns .",
    "satisfaction of all trigger tiers initiates digitization of all antenna channels and occurs at a rate of approximately 10 hz .",
    "by contrast , the l1 and l2 rates are approximately 23 mhz , and 2.5 khz per antenna pair , respectively .",
    "laboratory studies have demonstrated that trigger efficiency differences between anita-1 and anita - ii result primarily from the removal of the hpol antenna channels from the trigger logic , and the modified frequency banding .",
    "as a monopole interacts with the ice , it sheds energy stochastically , so the monopole signal will be comprised of a string of impulsive subshower events .",
    "when anita triggers , the signal is temporarily stored in one of four buffers and is then read to hard disk .",
    "as soon as one buffer is filled , it is read out and then reset for the next event . since this process requires some minimum time ,",
    "if a series of triggers occur in rapid succession ( e.g. , within 1 @xmath40s ) , there is insufficient time to maintain at least one free buffer .",
    "once all four buffers fill , read , clear , and reset commands are sequentially issued , requiring a minimum time of tens of milliseconds , much longer than the monopole signal would be visible to the balloon .",
    "the experimental monopole signature registered in anita is therefore expected to consist of the first four threshold - crossings ( @xmath19500 nanoseconds total ) once the monopole comes into view ; the remaining signal produced by the monopole ionization trail is not registered during the dead - time required after the four buffers initially fill .",
    "the 500 nanosecond estimate also includes a small delay between successive triggers , as they fill the available buffers .",
    "the experimental in - flight data show a minimum time between triggers @xmath41=112 ns ( fig .",
    "[ mintimefigure.eps ] ) , to be compared with the 100 ns of data recorded in a standard waveform capture .",
    "this value is commensurate with laboratory measurements prior to the flight .",
    "our monopole event selection criterion therefore consists of four ` fast ' triggers over a time interval @xmath42 ; it remains only to define how quickly the triggers must be registered ( @xmath43 ) in order to be considered a monopole candidate . to minimize bias ,",
    "@xmath43 was determined using a ` dedicated background ' ( db ) subset of the total anita dataset , defined as all data taken when the balloon was within 300 km of mcmurdo base .",
    "this subset comprised approximately 15% of the total data .",
    "for this dataset , figure [ fig : mcanitapretty ] shows the @xmath42 distribution , with the monopole mc simulated distribution overlaid , as well as a polynomial fit to the db distribution .",

    "this is the main monopole selection criteria then applied to our ` search ' sample .",
    "monte carlo simulations of monopoles isotropically illuminating the antarctic ice sheet are used to determine the @xmath44500 ns efficiency . although the bulk of high - energy monopoles which produce four triggers also satisfy the @xmath44500 ns criterion , the limited geometric acceptance for producing four triggers ( @xmath461% , designated as `` @xmath47 '' ) provides the main limitation on the total efficiency ( designated as `` @xmath48 '' ) .",
    "the ratio of events satisfying both the simulated trigger ( which includes aperture ) , as well as the @xmath44500 ns requirement relative to the total events generated in simulation for each @xmath1 value ( typically 20,000 ) , are as follows :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     also shown in the last row are the errors on the total efficiency ; our eventual limits will later be degraded by one statistical error bar in each energy bin .      after establishing the requirement that @xmath44500 ns based on the db sample , the trigger time distribution of the remainder of the data set ( the monopole ` search ' sample ) was considered .",
    "it is desirable that the number of events passing this requirement in the search sample be small enough that they can be individually hand - scanned and their candidacy assessed against monte carlo simulated monopole templates . extrapolating the db @xmath42 distribution into the ` signal ' region below 500 ns ( fig .",

    "only four events contain four rapid triggers which satisfy the 500 ns maximum total trigger time criterion .",
    "all four of these events were already classified as background , using the rejection criteria developed for the primary anita - ii neutrino search@xcite .",
    "specifically , the first two events were rejected on the basis of their temporal near - coincidence ( occurring within 15 seconds of each other ) as well as having source locations ( after filtering for strong continuous wave [ cw ] components ) consistent , to within @xmath191 degree , with the south pole .",
    "the third event was recognized as payload noise , on the basis of an anomalous dc offset , and saturated waveforms in all phi sectors .",
    "the final event was rejected on the basis of its power spectrum , which is observed to be dominated by one narrow cw frequency without which the event would be sub - threshold for analysis . removing that one line from the frequency spectrum results in a time - domain waveform which also reconstructs to a known background source location in west antarctica and further affirms this as a background event .",

    "determine the frequency bin with the highest fractional power .",
    "for a uniform population , and based on 256 time - domain samples , this quantity would be 1/(256/2 ) , or 1/128 . assuming that , for man - made backgrounds , that bin will also have the highest spectral power for the next 3 events in a candidate quartet , we now calculate the product of the fractional power ( `` pfp '' ) , for that same bin determined from the first captured event , for all four events in a quartet . for thermal noise ,",

    "we have compared our simulation with the monopole energy loss calculated independently by the mmc code@xcite , which was originally designed for muons and subsequently adapted to model monopoles for the icecube collaboration .",
    "unlike our simulation , the mmc energy loss parametrization is based on several different theoretical calculations , and also calculates energy losses independently of our simulations . since the kinematic regime targeted by the icecube analysis is approximately 5 - 10 orders of magnitude lower than for this analysis , the overlap between the simulations is limited to gamma values of order @xmath64 . for @xmath65 , we find agreement between the results of the two simulations to within 13.5% .",
    "our overall result is relatively insensitive to the parametrization of thermal noise in our simulation .",
    "the addition of such noise is included in our simulation and will , on average , lead to a noticeable efficiency improvement for very large simulation samples . for our limited simulation samples , however , this effect is mitigated by the stochastic nature of the monopole energy deposition , which leads to a large number of in - ice showers with widely varying energies , and distributed over viewing angles varying by up to several degrees relative to the balloon .    to account for our limited monte carlo statistics",
    ", we have included an error equal to the fractional statistical precision on our monte carlo - derived detection efficiency . to account for the uncertainty in our choice of @xmath44500 ns as the optimal monopole event selection requirement",
    ", we have also folded in a systematic error equal to the inefficiency of our @xmath44500 ns event selection requirement ( 10% ) .",
    "added in quadrature with both the energy loss uncertainty ( 13.5% ) , as well as the 23% systematic error determined above yields a net systematic error of 28% .",
    "our final upper limit is accordingly degraded by this fraction .",
    "uncertainties in our livetime calculation are believed to be smaller than 5% and can therefore be neglected in our total systematic error .",
    "we note that the two dominant systematic errors above are independent of each other  the energy loss uncertainty is assessed without fully propagating the signal to the balloon , while the latter uncertainty measures the error in our modeling subsequent to energy deposition .",
    "note that the final result is somewhat robust to changes in the overall scale of @xmath66  increasing @xmath66 leads to brighter in - ice showers , but reduces the flux of monopoles that can penetrate to the ice sheet from below the horizon .",
    "conversely , reducing @xmath66 increases the flux arriving at the ice sheet , but decreases the magnitude of signal strength on a monopole - by - monopole basis . in general , anita s sensitivity to relativistic monopoles is primarily determined by the detector / ice geometry . for monopole trajectories that do illuminate the balloon , we expect there to be tens , if not hundreds of potential showers which can cause event triggers . in practice ,",
    "only the first four of these are recorded by the data acquisition system .",
    "overall , we have tried to take a conservative approach in calculating our sensitivity , including : a ) tracking the monopole over the only the upper half of the ice sheet and neglecting any signal from the lower half which results in a conservative estimate of effective area , b ) calculating sensitivity under the assumption that systematic errors are uncorrelated , and therefore forfeiting any numerical advantage that would be gained by taking such correlations into account , c ) using an estimated trigger efficiency which is approximately 25% less efficient than that employed for the primary neutrino search .",
    "particle flux is reported in units of @xmath67 . to calculate an upper bound on the diffuse monopole flux ,",
    "the upper limit on the number of observed particles ( @xmath68 ) , live time ( @xmath69 ) , detection area ( @xmath70 ) , and the solid angle from which incident particles are approaching ( @xmath71 ) must be known . in this experiment",
    ", none of the candidate events met the acceptance criteria , so the number of observed particles is zero , corresponding to a poisson 90% confidence level upper limit on the number of observed particles of 2.3 ( we neglect possible background contributions which , if included , would tend to strengthen our derived upper limit ) . the bd=4 live time given by the simulation is @xmath69=975,000 s. the detection area is the surface area of a spherical cap of radius r=680 km and is therefore slightly greater than the planar projection area of @xmath72 ( by approximately 5% ) .",
    "finally , we must include the efficiency for events to both trigger , as well as to pass our @xmath44500 ns ( @xmath48 ) requirement , and also the efficiency for events to pass our base rejection requirements ( @xmath56 ) in the expression for particle flux @xmath73 ( eqn .",
    "[ pf ] ) ; we take @xmath56 to be the value used for the neutrino - search analysis ( 63% ) , as those search criteria are invoked during the final phase of the analysis in our elimination of the four events passing the @xmath44500 ns requirement from monopole candidacy . @xmath74",
    "our final results are shown in figure [ fig : results ] .",
    "we obtain a flux limit of order @xmath75 at @xmath76 , improving slowly over the next few decades in monopole @xmath1 . for large gamma values ,",
    "the results for anita are considerably lower than that of any experiment to date",
    ".     have been weakened by a factor of two , to account for increasing earth opacity.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    although the bandpasses of the rice and anita experiments are comparable , the anita analysis strategy is directed at monopole detection @xmath77 , affording a factor of three improvement in efficiency relative to the rice analysis , which was driven by a neutrino search strategy .",
    "the additional enhancement in effective collection area ( @xmath19500 , including losses in collection area due to rejecting bases ) more than compensates anita s factor of @xmath1950 smaller livetime relative to rice .",
    "from the non - observation of highly ionizing showers we have derived the monopole flux upper limits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] , which are on the order of @xmath78 .",
    "previously , amanda@xcite , baikal@xcite , and macro@xcite determined monopole flux limits on the order of @xmath79 for @xmath25 greater than @xmath80 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "although the results of this study cover a much narrower range of @xmath25 values than previous works , it is the range that is of the greatest interest for imm searches . within much of this kinematic range ( @xmath82 gev ; @xmath83 ) , monopole flux limits from anita are stronger than the limits from any previous astrophysical monopole search .",
