    "stars have a profound effect upon the interstellar medium ( ism ) that surrounds them .",
    "stellar radiation heats  and sometimes photoionizes and photodissociates  the interstellar gas , while supersonic outflows associated with stellar birth ( in protostellar outflows ) and death ( in supernova remnants ) send shock waves propagating through the ism . in regions of high mass star - formation  such as the orion molecular cloud , for example  many of these processes operate simultaneously , making their separate effects hard to disentangle and elucidate . in herbig - haro objects and supernova remnants , by contrast , the effects of shock waves can be studied in relative isolation in an environment where the stellar radiation field is not greatly enhanced .    over more than three decades , the physics and chemistry of interstellar shock waves",
    "have been the subject of intensive study , both theoretical and observational , the results of which have been summarized in several review articles ( e.g. walmsley & pineau des forts 2005 ; draine & mckee 1993 ) .",
    "when shock waves propagate within molecular clouds , the shock velocity and magnetic field determine the fate of the gas .",
    "fast shocks ( with propagation velocities @xmath12 given interstellar magnetic fields of typical strength ) are dissociative : they destroy molecules and may ionize the resultant atoms .",
    "slow shocks ( @xmath13 ) , by contrast , are non - dissociative : they heat and compress the molecular gas through which they pass , and may modify its chemical composition , but molecules survive their passage .",
    "the chemical changes wrought by non - dissociative shocks typically result from elevated gas temperatures or the phenomenon of ion - neutral drift ( crucially important in non - dissociative shocks ) , which can drive chemical processes that are negligibly slow in cold clouds because they are endothermic or possess activation energy barriers .",
    "the result of these processes depends critically upon the timescale for key chemical reactions relative to the period of time for which shock elevates the temperature and ion - neutral drift velocities . in a previous study of hh54 carried out with the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ , neufeld et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter nmh98 ) argued that the h@xmath2 ortho - to - para ratio , observed to lie significantly below its equilibrium value ( @xmath14 ) in the warm ( @xmath15k ) shocked gas in hh54 , provided a valuable probe of the relevant timescales .",
    "the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on board the _ spitzer space telescope _ is a powerful tool for the study of shocked interstellar gas . with a wavelength coverage of 5.2  37 @xmath16 m , _",
    "spitzer_/irs provides access to the s(0 ) through s(7 ) pure rotational lines of h@xmath2 , as well as fine structure emissions of several atoms and ions produced in fast , dissociative shocks : ne@xmath1 , si@xmath1 , s , and fe@xmath1 .",
    "the great sensitivity of _",
    "spitzer_/irs , together with the multiplex advantage inherent in long slit spectroscopy , allows large regions to be mapped rapidly .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of spectral line mapping in hh54 and hh@xmath17 , two well - studied herbig - haro objects known to contain warm molecular gas .",
    "hh 711 is a chain of herbig - haro objects in the perseus molecular cloud , associated with ngc 1333 ( snell & edwards 1981 ) .",
    "these objects lie in the blue - shifted part of a co outflow that originates near the protostar svs 13 .",
    "hh 711 has been studied extensively through observations of optical emission lines ( hartigan , curiel , & raymond 1989 ) , near - ir emission lines of [ fe  ii ] ( stapelfeldt et al 1991 ; gredel 1996 ) , h@xmath2 vibrational emissions ( noriega - crespo et al .",

    "one key result to emerge from previous studies is that the hot h@xmath2 emission exhibits a classic bow shaped morphology in hh  7 , with an emission peak offset from the peak emission of atomic fine structure lines .",
    "observations of the hh711 flow have proven valuable in constraining detailed models for shock excited gas ( e.g. hartigan , raymond , & hartmann 1987 ; smith , khanzadyan , & davis 2003 ) .",

    "well studied than hh7 - 11 , hh54 is notable because of an unusually large abundance of water vapor ( liseau et al .",

    "the observational details are provided in table 1 .",
    "the data were processed at the spitzer science center ( ssc ) , using version 12 of the processing pipeline , and then reduced further using the smart software package ( higdon et al .",
    "2004 ) , supplemented by additional routines that we have developed .",
    "the key capabilities provided by these additional routines were the removal of bad pixels in the lh and sh data , the calibration of fluxes obtained for extended sources , the extraction of individual spectra at each position sampled by the irs slit , and the creation of spectral line maps from the set of extracted spectra .",
    "details of our data reduction method , as well as the various tests we performed to validate the additional routines that we developed , are discussed in appendix a.",
    "widespread rotational emissions from molecular hydrogen , along with fine structure emissions from atomic sulfur and several singly - ionized species , were detected in each of the two sources we mapped . in figures 1 and 2",
    "we present maps of the h@xmath2 line emissions detected in hh54 .",
    "the straight lines demark the regions within which each transition was mapped .",
    "the s(1 ) through s(7 ) lines all show morphological similarities , with most maps showing local maxima close to clumps e and k and to clump c ( in the designation of sandell et al .",
    "1987 ) . however , real differences in the spatial distribution of the various transitions are apparent and provide key information about the spatial variation of the h@xmath2 excitation and ortho - to - para ratio ; these variations are discussed in detail in  4.2 and  4.4 below .",
    "emissions in several fine structure transitions have also been detected toward hh54 .",

    "offsets between the fine structure emissions and the h@xmath2 emissions are clearly evident in figure 7 ( left panel ) , which shows contour plots that compare the distributions of the [ neii ] and h@xmath2 s(3 ) emissions , suggesting a different origin for the h@xmath2 and fine structure emissions , discussed further in  4.1    figures 4 and 5 show maps of the h@xmath2 line emissions detected in hh711 .",

    "is again deferred to  4.2 and  4.4 .    as in hh54 ,",
    "emissions in several fine structure transitions have also been detected in hh711 .",
    "figure 6 shows maps of the [ feii ]  26@xmath16 m , [ si ] 25@xmath16 m , and [ siii ] 35@xmath16 m line emissions detected with the lh module toward hh7 . unlike in hh54 , the [ neii ] 12.8  @xmath16 m line is not detected .",
    "figure 7 ( right panel ) shows that the fine structure emissions , as traced by [ siii ] in this case , are again offset from the h@xmath2 emissions , peaking several arcseconds closer to svs13 .",

    "we denote the three circular beams hh54fs ( the peak of the [ neii ] emission ) , hh54c ( the northern of the two h@xmath2 peaks , being roughly coincident with clump c identified by sandell et al .",

    "a total of eight h@xmath2 rotational lines and eight fine structure lines of ne@xmath1 , si@xmath1 , s , and fe@xmath1 ( 5 transitions ) have been detected at one or more such region .",
    "table 2 lists the detected lines together with the mean frequency - integrated intensities for each circular region . as discussed in  4.1 below",
    ", the h@xmath2 line ratios and intensities are typical of slow nondissociative shocks , while the fine structure line intensities are in good agreement with those expected from fast dissociative shocks .",
    "no fewer than five [ feii ] fine structure lines are clearly detected toward position hh54fs .",
    "the observed spectra are shown in figure 9 , and the transitions detected are marked on the grotrian diagram in figure 10 .",
    "the strength of the higher excitation transitions originating in the @xmath25 term , relative to the lower transitions within the @xmath26 term , is expected to be an increasing function of both temperature and density . as discussed in  4.1 ,",
    "the [ feii ] line ratios provide a valuable probe of the physical conditions in the emitting region .",
    "upper limits are also obtained for two rotational transitions of water vapor that lie within the lh band and are discussed in  4.3 below .",
    "in addition , the r(3 ) and r(4 ) rotational lines of hd have been tentatively detected and discussed elsewhere ( neufeld et al .  2006 ) .",
    "in both sources that we observed , clear offsets between the fine - structure emissions and the molecular hydrogen emissions are evident .",
    "similar offsets have also been observed toward herbig - haro objects in the ggd37 ( cepheus a west ) region ( raines , 2000 ) .",
    "the fine structure emissions in hh7 are offset by @xmath27 from the bow shock , corresponding to a projected distance of @xmath28 for an assumed distance to the source of 250  pc .",
    "such an offset has been observed previously in hh7 ( staplefeldt et al .",
    "1991 ) , where near - infrared emissions from [ feii ] and h@xmath2 have been mapped at subarcsecond resolution by noriega - crespo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) using the _ hubble space telescope_. noriega - crespo et al .  interpreted the [ feii ] emissions as emerging from a `` mach disk '' , in which the collimated supersonic outflow is decelerated and heated in a fast shock . in this picture , the fast shock is offset from a slower non - dissociative bow shock that is driven into the ambient molecular medium , the latter giving rise to the molecular hydrogen emissions observed from hh7 .",
    "our mid - infrared observations indicate that the [ siii ] and [ si ] fine structure emissions  like the [ feii ] emissions  also emerge from a region offset from the bow shock .",
    "the morphology of the [ siii ] map is most similar to the [ feii ] map .",
    "these observations support the two - shock picture in which the [ feii ] , [ si ] and [ siii ] fine structure emissions emerge from fast shock .",
    "our observations of hh54 indicate a similar offset ( @xmath29 , corresponding to a projected distance of @xmath30 for a source distance of 200  pc ) between the fine structure and molecular hydrogen emissions . as in hh7 ,",
    "the centroid of the fine structure emissions lies closer to the presumed source of the outflow than the h@xmath2 emissions , consistent with the two - shock picture in which the fine structure emissions trace a fast shock that decelerates the collimated outflow .",
    "we have compared the observed fine structure line intensities listed in table 2 with predictions of the fast shock model of hollenbach & mckee ( 1989 , hereafter hm89 ) . because the beam filling factor of shocked material is not known ,",
    "line ratios provide a more valuable diagnostic than absolute intensities . although the predictions of the hm89 shock models are undoubtedly somewhat uncertain  given substantial uncertainties in the collisional excitation rates for the various transitions and in the gas - phase abundances of the various elements  the predicted [ neii ]",
    "12.8@xmath31m/[feii ]  26.0  @xmath31 m line ratio is a strongly increasing function of the shock velocity , values @xmath32 being needed to ionize ne significantly .",
    "the [ neii ]  12.8@xmath31m/[feii ]  26.0@xmath31 m line ratio of @xmath33 observed in hh54 requires a shock velocity @xmath34 . in hh7 , by contrast , the absence of detectable [ neii ]  12.8@xmath31 m emission places an upper limit @xmath35 , whilst our measurement of the [ feii ]  17.9@xmath31 m transition requires a shock velocity of at least @xmath36 .",
    "the hm89 shock models predict that the [ feii ] and [ siii ] line intensities show a very similar dependence upon the shock velocity , whilst the [ si]/[feii ] and [ si]/[siii ] line ratios are a decreasing function of shock velocity .",
    "this prediction provides a natural explanation for the fact that the [ siii ] map is most similar to the [ feii ] map : insofar as the fine structure emissions may arise from a superposition of shocks at varying velocities , the [ si ] emissions would be expected to show a spatial distribution that is somewhat different from [ siii ] and [ feii ] .",
    "an independent check of the two - shock picture is provided by our detection of multiple [ feii ] lines . the mimimum temperature derived from the [ feii ] line ratios ( @xmath37  k ) is larger than the maximum temperature at which h@xmath2 can survive for any appreciable time period  and is a factor @xmath38 larger than that inferred from the h@xmath2 line ratios ( see  4.2 below )  lending strong support to the theory that both dissociative and nondissociative shocks are present in the source .",
    "the h@xmath2 s(0 ) ",
    "s(7 ) emissions provide a valuable probe of the temperature distribution in the shocked gas in which h@xmath2 is the dominant constituent .",
    "the observed line intensities for these h@xmath2 quadrupole transitions provide a direct measurement of the column density , @xmath39 in each upper state , @xmath40 , because all the lines involved are optically - thin . as in nmh98",
    ", we applied extinction corrections based upon the interstellar extinction curves of weingartner & draine ( 2001 ;  milky way , @xmath41 \" ) . for hh54 , we adopted gredel s ( 1994 ) estimate of 0.3 for @xmath42 , obtained from observations of the [ feii ] 1.257 and 1.644 @xmath16 m transitions toward hh54e+k , whilst for hh7 we adopted the estimate @xmath43 obtained by gredel ( 1996 ) for the nearby source hh8 .    in figure 11 , based upon the line intensities tabulated in table 2 , we present rotational diagrams for each of the four circular regions for which we computed an average spectrum (  3.2 ) .",
    "two features are common to all observed positions .",
    "first , as discussed further in  4.4 below , the rotational diagrams all show the  zigzag \" patterns characteristic of non - equilibrium ortho - to - para ratios , in which a fit to the para- ( even-@xmath44 ) states lies above that for the ortho- ( odd-@xmath44 states ) .",
    "second , the rotational diagrams all exhibit a degree of curvature , with the slope of the rotational diagram decreasing with increasing @xmath44 .",
    "this curvature indicates that each beam is sampling material at a range of temperatures .",
    "furthermore , the absence of any turnover in the curvature at high @xmath44 suggests that the rotational level populations are close to local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) even for @xmath44 as high as 9 .    for each circular region in table 2 , we determined an excitation temperature , @xmath45 , from the ratio of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 column densities and defined according to @xmath48}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the energy and degeneracy of state @xmath44 . because the ortho - para ratio shows departures from equilibrium , the quantity @xmath45 is most useful when @xmath51 and @xmath52 are either both odd or both even . the excitation temperatures",
    "@xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are given in table 3 ; the inequalities @xmath59 and @xmath60 observed in every case are a simple manifestation of the curvature apparent in the rotational diagrams .    we have obtained two - component fits to the rotational diagrams , in which a least squares fit was obtained for a combination of warm and hot gas components , assumed to be in lte except with non - lte ortho - to - para ratios , with temperatures @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( typically found to be @xmath63  k and @xmath64  k , respectively ) .",
    "the solid lines in figure 11 show the two - component fits to the rotational diagrams , while the points indicate the measured values .",
    "the two - component fits provide an excellent fit to the data , although the solution is clearly non - unique .",
    "indeed , there is no specific evidence for a bimodal temperature distribution , and the data could be fit equally well by models that invoke a continuous range of gas temperatures .",
    "the assumption of lte is clearly valid for the lower rotational states , but the data would allow modest departures from lte for the highest states that we have observed . indeed , calculations by le bourlot et al .",
    "( 1999 ) indicate that the critical density for @xmath65 ( at which the probabilities of collisional and radiative de - excitation are equal ) is @xmath66 , a factor of several larger than the densities inferred from observations of co in some of these sources ( see discussion below ) .",
    "departures from lte , if present , would be an increasing function of the rotational quantum number , @xmath44 , and would therefore require higher gas temperatures than the values inferred under the assumption of lte .",
    "the best - fit temperatures , computed under the assumption of lte , together with the beam - averaged column densities ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) and the h@xmath2 ortho - to - para ratios ( opr@xmath69 and opr@xmath70 ) , are listed in table 3 . table 3 also shows the sum of the @xmath71 though @xmath72 column densities , @xmath73 , all of which are derived directly from observations with the short - low module ; not surprising , @xmath73 falls a factor of several below @xmath74 because it only includes states with @xmath75 .",
    "the estimated gas temperatures , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , are characteristic of low - velocity nondissociative shocks ( which are of  c \"- type in the designation of draine ( 1980 ) ; see also appendix b ) . by means of a simple analytic treatment of energy conservation in such shocks ( appendix b ) , constrained by the results of the detailed shock models of kaufman & neufeld ( 1996 ; hereafter kn96 ) , we find the characteristic gas temperature within such shocks to be given by @xmath76 ( eqn .",
    "b8 ) , where @xmath77 is the shock velocity and @xmath78 is the assumed preshock magnetic field for a shock propagating in material of preshock h@xmath2 density @xmath79 . given our standard assumption about the magnetic field , @xmath80 , the warm and hot gas components typically correspond to shock velocities of @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xmath83 respectively .",
    "the h@xmath2 rotational diagrams predicted by kn96 and other theoretical shock models ( e.g. wilgenbus et al .",
    "2000 ) all exhibit less curvature than our observed rotational diagrams , implying the presence of a range of shock velocities within each of the circular apertures demarked in figure 7 .    the preshock h@xmath2 density , @xmath79 , is less well constrained by the h@xmath2 line fluxes .",
    "the best estimates for the density of the warm shocked gas have been obtained by observations of high - lying rotational lines of co , for which non - lte line ratios provide a valuable probe .",

    "b6 ) : @xmath86 .",
    "similar values were obtained for hh711 , based upon measurements of co line ratios ( molinari et al .",
    "2000 ) , although measurements of the co / h@xmath2 line ratios argued for smaller values ( @xmath87 ) toward hh7 .",
    "the observed column density of shocked h@xmath2 is predicted to be @xmath88 ( appendix b , eqn .",

    ", the observed value of @xmath89 is @xmath91 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath89 can be smaller than unity when the beam is incompletely covered by shocked material .",
    "for our two component fits to the circular apertures presented in table 3 , the values of @xmath89 required for the warm and hot components are typically @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively , implying that the shocked material has a covering factor considerably smaller than unity and possesses substructure that is not resolved by these observations . in hh7 , the subarcsecond resolution maps of near - ir h@xmath2 vibrational emissions presented by noreiga - crespo et al .",

    "the spectral line maps obtained for hh54 and hh7 also permit us to obtain a rotational diagram at each spatial position , and thereby to derive detailed maps of the gas temperature , ortho - to - para ratio , and column density of the shocked gas .",
    "while the average spectra presented in figure 8 are of sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) to permit the two - component fits described above , the lower snr obtained in a single spectrum does not warrant a two - component fit to the rotational diagram .",
    "accordingly , in constructing maps of the gas temperature , we obtained a least - squares fit to the @xmath71 through @xmath95 column densities ( all measured with the sl module ) for a _ single _ gas component with a temperature and h@xmath2 ortho - to - para ratio , maps of which are presented in figure 12 ( middle and lower panels respectively ) . here , the white contours show the h@xmath2 s(3 ) line intensity , and regions of low snr have been masked and appear in black .",
    "the upper panel in figure 12 shows the sum of the @xmath71 though @xmath72 column densities , @xmath73 .",
    "figure 12 shows that the fitted gas temperature is remarkably constant over the mapped region , lying generally within the range @xmath96  k , and indicating that a similar admixture of shock velocities is present along each line - of - sight .",

    "thus nmh98 argued that the opr of @xmath142 observed toward hh54 indicated ( 1 ) that the warm ( @xmath143  k ) shocked h@xmath2 that they observed in hh54 must have previously acquired an opr characteristic of equilibrium at a temperature @xmath144  k and ( 2 ) that the observed gas has not been warm long enough for a high - temperature opr to have been established .",
