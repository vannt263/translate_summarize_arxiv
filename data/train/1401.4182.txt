    "dwarf galaxies are some of the most dark - matter dominated objects in the universe , with inferred mass - to - light ratios of @xmath8 1000 ( mcconnachie 2012 ) . as test - beds for theories of low - luminosity galaxy formation , dwarf galaxies are crucial elements of near - field cosmology .",
    "they are also sensitive probes of galaxy interactions . the tidal debris structure of the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy ( majewski et al . 03 ; niederste - ostholt et al .",
    "2010 ; henceforth m03,n10 ) speaks of a past violent encounter with our galaxy ( purcell et al .",
    "2011 ; law & majewski 2010 ; johnston et al .",
    "1999 , henceforth p11 ; lm10 ; j99 ) . here , we investigate if the measured proper motions of the sgr dwarf ( pryor et al .",
    "2010 ) and its tidal debris can be used to relate fundamental properties of sgr s orbit to the mass of the milky way and the progenitor sgr mass .    interpreting the evidence of past interactions of the milky way ( mw ) dwarf galaxies depends critically on accurate estimates of their current positions and velocities , and on reliable mass estimates .",
    "recently , there has been considerable progress in obtaining accurate proper motions of mw satellites .",
    "hst proper - motion measurements ( kallivayallil et al .",
    "2006 , kallivayallil et al .",
    "2013 , henceforth k13 ) of the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc , smc ) have been used to derive past orbits of these two satellites ( besla et al .",
    "2007 , henceforth b07 ) , and of leo i ( sohn et al .",
    "2013 ; boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "masses of dwarf galaxies remain however highly uncertain .",
    "this is particularly true of the most massive ones ( sgr , lmc , smc ) that are significantly out of equilibrium ( walker et al . 2009 ; mcconnachie 2012 ) .",
    "estimates of the mass of the sgr dwarf progenitor have varied from @xmath9 ( j99 ; lm10 ) , to @xmath10 ( n10 ) , to @xmath11 ( p11 ) .",
    "estimates of the virial mass of the mw also vary  from @xmath12 ( watkins et al .",
    "2010 ) , to @xmath13 ( deason et al . 2012 ; rashkov et al .",
    "these uncertainties impede progress on the analysis of tidal interactions from galactic satellites , and prompt us to ask if one can relate the the mass of the mw and the sgr dwarf to the measured proper motions and tidal debris .",
    "this is a necessary first step in developing a secure framework for studying the effects of satellites on the galactic disk .",
    "moreover , methods to constrain galactic masses have wide - ranging ramifications , from galaxy formation to implications for dark matter models .",
    "the mw displays many signs of tidal interactions  from large - scale planar disturbances and a prominent warp in hi ( levine , blitz & heiles 2006a , b ) , to stellar streams ( m03 ; belokurov et al .",
    "attempts to explain these features range from an inverse method designed to infer the satellite mass and location from analysis of observed disturbances ( chakrabarti & blitz 2009 ; chakrabarti & blitz 2011 ) , to the more commonly employed forward morphological analysis ( p11 ) .",
    "these earlier studies adopted ad - hoc initial conditions for the positions and velocities of the satellites .",
    "for example , p11 adopted initial conditions at early times from the work of keselman et al . ( 2009 ) that are inconsistent with backward integration of the equations of motion , to within the uncertainties of the measured proper motions .",
    "chakrabarti et al.s ( 2011 ) analysis of the hi maps of galaxies with tidally dominant , optically visible companions provides the basic proof of principle of the inverse method , but those authors did not use all the observational constraints we have at our disposal , especially for mw satellites where proper motions can be obtained .",
    "while there has been a great deal of work on modeling properties of sgr s tidal stream , much of that work has not included dynamical friction from the galactic halo ( j99 ; law et al .",
    "2005 ; lm10 ; price - whelan & johnston 2013 ) ; p11 s simulations are self - consistent , but employed ad - hoc initial conditions . our procedure here ( orbit integrations including the effect of dynamical friction ) can sample the large parameter space of measured proper motions of multiple satellites ( and uncertainties thereof ) efficiently , and as such can easily incorporate improved proper motion and distance measurements from gaia ( perryman et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : method ] , we summarize our methodology , which for the orbital calculation is similar to b07 and k13 , and includes a treatment of dynamical friction , which is particularly relevant for the sgr dwarf . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present the distribution of eccentricities of sgr s orbit as a function of the mass of the milky way , when including dynamical friction and without .",
    "we explain the physical basis of the variation of the mean of the distribution , as well as the spread in eccentricities , and present a qualitative comparison to various observational inferences of sgr s apocenter .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "given the measured 3d position and velocity , @xmath14 , derived from hst proper motions of the the sgr dwarf ( pryor et al .",
    "2010 ) and the lmc and smc ( k13 ) , we integrate the equations of motion backwards in time as in prior work ( b07 ) .",
    "we randomly sample the distribution of velocities and positions and calculate 1000 orbit realizations for each model , using a fourth - order runge - kutta integration scheme in our test particle orbit integrator code ( chang & chakrabarti 2011 ) .",
    "we show in a forthcoming paper that the sgr dwarf , lmc , and smc are the main known tidal players of our galaxy , and while we include all three in our calculations , our analysis in this paper is focused on sgr s orbit .",
    "we consider the interaction of the satellites with the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo of our galaxy , which we take to be static , spherical , and having a mass distribution specified by the hernquist ( 1990 ) potential , i.e. :    @xmath15    one may associate a hernquist profile with an equivalent nfw profile that emerges in cosmological simulations , as in springel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we adopt the hernquist profile for the dark matter halo here ; the values for the mass ( @xmath1 ) and scale length ( @xmath16 ) that we use are listed in table 1 .",
    "we also model the dynamical friction experienced by the satellites as they travel through the dark matter halo of the mw , by using the chandrasekhar formula .",
    "thus , the equation of motion for a particular satellite is :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the dynamical friction term , @xmath19 is the satellite mass , and @xmath20 is the potential corresponding to equation [ eq : hern ] .",

    "motivated by recent studies ( hashimoto et al .",
    "2003 ; b07 ) , we take the coulomb logarithm @xmath27 , where @xmath23 is the distance of the satellite from the galactic center and @xmath28 is the softening length if the satellite is modeled with a plummer profile .",
    "we integrate equation [ eq : motion ] backwards to @xmath29 .",
    "we choose @xmath30 to compare our results to p11 s simulation , and because satellites like sgr are expected to disrupt in a time of order a few gyr ( j99 ) .",
    "our model parameters ( sgr masses and milky way mass and scale length ) are listed in table 1 . for the lmc , we employ the mass most directly motivated by imaging surveys ( saha et al .",
    "2010 ) , which gives @xmath31 for the lmc , and we adopt @xmath32 for the smc .",
    "without the inclusion of dynamical friction in the equations of motion , the satellite moves conservatively in the fixed , spherical potential assumed for the mw halo .",
    "although orbits are not closed in such potentials , the energy and angular momenta are strictly conserved . in analogy with keplerian motion",
    ", we define a generalized eccentricity in terms of the apocenter ( @xmath33 ) and pericenter ( @xmath34 ) as @xmath35    we consider the case of a satellite for which we have measured its @xmath14 . for simplicity , we assume the satellite is at known pericenter @xmath36 ( but our derivation can be easily generalized ) .",
    "we assume that the functional form for the potential , @xmath37 , is known , aside from the normalization , @xmath38 , the total mass . to relate this normalization @xmath38 to the eccentricity , it is sufficient to express the unknown apocenter distance in terms of @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 . at any point in its orbit ,",
    "the energy of the satellite is given by : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the radial and tangential velocities respectively , and @xmath43 is known ( with @xmath44 ) . at the pericenter and apocenter distances , @xmath45 . hence , the orbital energy at these locations is : @xmath46 where equation [ eq : hern ] for the potential has been adopted , and it is understood that @xmath47 $ ] .",

    "hence , for satellites orbiting in the potential of a galaxy where the total mass may not be known , but the proper motions have been measured , the relevant description is : @xmath54 .",

    "the horizontal lines are based on various observational measures of sgr s apocenter from m03 , b14 , lm10 , along with p11 s light sgr model .",
    "[ f : eccmsgrm ] ]    the essential effects of dynamical friction on this problem can be summarized as follows .",
    "more massive satellites have larger apocenters when integrating backwards , as the dynamical friction term causes satellites to accelerate in proportion to their mass on the backwards trajectory .",
    "figure [ f : rsgrvr ] ( a ) shows sgr s orbit in a @xmath61 milky way , when including dynamical friction and without , for models h and n ( described in table 1 ) . the eccentricity of the orbit evolves as a function of time when dynamical friction is included .",
    "the apocenters of model h agree with belokurov et al.s ( 2014 ) ( henceforth b14 ) observations , i.e. , the leading and trailing apocenters differ by @xmath8 50 kpc .",
    "earlier models did not produce this behavior because they did not include dynamical friction .",
    "p11 s ad - hoc choice of sgr s initial position of 80 kpc at @xmath30 means that they also do not agree with b14 observations .",
    "the apocenters determined by b14 and m03 are marked in figure [ f : rsgrvr ] ( a ) with yellow and black dotted lines respectively .",
    "secondly , dynamical friction causes a contraction of phase space , leading to a `` crowding '' of orbits in plots like that of figure [ f : rsgrvr ] ( b ) .",
    "this leads to a smaller spread in eccentricities at a given @xmath1 .",
    "third , the velocity dependence of the dynamical friction force is such that it is primarily due to dark matter particles that are moving more slowly than the satellite . for satellites close to pericenter , it acts preferentially on the tangential component of the velocity , leading to a larger increase in the tangential component than in the radial velocity , on the backwards trajectory .",
    "observers stand to gain the most precise inference of satellite apocenters ( and equivalently the milky way and sgr mass ) for massive satellites like sgr that are close to pericenter by more precise measurements of the tangential velocity .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ f : eccmsgrm ] shows the distribution of inferred eccentricities for three models of the mw potential , where we vary the sgr mass from @xmath62 .",
    "we consider the maximum excursion of sgr s orbit over 2.65 gyr to be the `` apocenter '' and the minimum over this time period to be the `` pericenter '' in equation [ eq : ecc ] . for a comparison with observations of sgr s tidal debris ,",
    "we take the farthest galactocentric distance at which tidal debris from sgr has been determined to be the apocenter , and its current galactocentric distance ( 20.8 kpc , e.g. pryor et al . 2010 ) to be the pericenter .",
    "the horizontal lines demarcate various observational measures of the eccentricity  from 2mass data ( m03 ; lm10 ) , to recent analysis using sdss data ( b14 ) , as well as the eccentricity of the sgr dwarf from p11 s n - body simulation of the light sgr model ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the @xmath64 case ( not shown ) , resembles the no dynamical friction model , with the mean eccentricity agreeing to within @xmath8 a few percent ( noted in table 1 ) .",
    "the m03 estimate is likely a lower - bound for the eccentricity given 2mass limiting magnitudes .",
    "the relative uncertainties in the determination of the maximum extent of tidal debris have not yet been enunciated , i.e. , the relative viability of blue horizontal branch stars ( b14 ) vs m - giants ( m03 ) vs red - clump stars ( correnti et al .",
    "2010 ) as tracers of tidal debris as a function of galactocentric distance given their intrinsic magnitudes and galactic distribution , as well as the likelihood of observed stars being truly associated with the sgr stream .",
    "while the vivas et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , m03 , lm10 , and correnti et al .",
    "( 2010 ) results for maximum tidal debris extent are roughly in agreement , they are all substantially below the b14 results .",
    "b14 s results are comparable to newberg et al.s ( 2003 ) observations . given the present uncertainty in observationally estimating the maximum extent of sgr s tidal debris , we defer a detailed comparison to observations to a future paper .",
    "however , it is clear from figure [ f : eccmsgrm ] that if b14 s observations have identified the farthest point in sgr s tidal stream , then sgr masses greater than @xmath65 are ruled out for mw masses @xmath5 .",
    "sgr masses less than @xmath66 are also precluded over this range of mw masses .",
    "we summarize our results for the orbit properties of the models in table 1 , which cover a total of 15,000 orbit realizations of sgr .",
    "the first column lists the @xmath1 and @xmath16 values for the milky way and the sgr mass , the second column the relative probability of realizing an eccentricity less than 0.6 , the third column the standard deviation of the eccentricity distribution , the fourth column the average number of pericenters ( not counting the current one ) , and the fifth column gives the average value of sgr s apocenter over 2.65 gyr .",
    "the final three rows refer to the cases where dynamical friction is not included in the equation of motion ( here the mass of the sgr dwarf does not enter into the calculation ) .",
    "note that all the models extend into the @xmath67 lower - bound region when dynamical friction is not included .",
    "the evolution of the satellite s orbit can be affected by the assumed form of the dark matter density profile .",
    "orbital decay in a constant - density core implies no change in the shape of the orbit ( merritt 1985 ) . at the other extreme of a very centrally concentrated halo ,",
    "the strong frictional force near pericenter implies circularization . in terms of the eccentricity - mass relation , if the `` orbital mass '' , i.e. , the mass distribution between sgr s pericenter and apocenters , for two different density profilles is comparable , then the density dependence on the eccentricity will not be significant . for nfw profiles with @xmath68 ( motivated by the range of models presented in klypin et al .",
    "2002 and maccio et al .",
    "2008 that agree approximately with measured rotation curves ) , the mean of the eccentricity distribution varies by less than 20 % relative to the hernquist profile .",
    "the mean values of the distribution will agree exactly for @xmath69 ( for @xmath70 ) that gives roughly the same mass interior to 100 kpc , and the same mass interior to sgr s first pericenter .",
    "an eccentricity - mass relation of the form @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) holds for satellites close to pericenter ( we show that it holds for lmc and fornax as well in a forthcoming paper ) . in principle",
    ", one could use a relation of this form to constrain masses of external galaxies given deep obervations of tidal debris .",
    "alternate theories of dark matter , such as mond ( milgrom 1983 ) do have the virtue of obtaining simple scaling relations ( mcgaugh 2004 ; walker & loeb 2014 ) . while a detailed discussion of the implications of this work for mond is beyond the scope of this paper , it is worth noting that the simplicity of the @xmath3 relation , and the masses it implies do favor the existence of dark matter halos . specifically ,",
    "the masses we infer for the sgr dwarf indicate substantial amounts of non - baryonic matter , rendering it distinct from the population of tidal dwarf galaxies , as discussed by dabringhausen & kroupa ( 2013 ) , which brings into question their assertion that _ all _ dwarf galaxies are tidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xmath73 given the measured hst proper motions of the sgr dwarf , and an assumed form of the milky way potential , there is a unique relation between the total mass ( or normalization to the potential ) and the eccentricity of sgr s orbit , in the absence of dynamical friction .",
    "the eccentricity - mass relation can be fit by a power - law of the form @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath73 dynamical friction increases the mean eccentricity of the distribution , i.e. , produces larger apocenters , and lowers the spread in the eccentricity distribution . at a fixed mw mass , sgr s average apocenters vary by @xmath75 over the range of sgr masses we consider ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "sgr s orbit is sensitive to the mass distribution of the mw between its pericenters and apocenters .",
    "the effects of different density profiles are minimal if this `` orbital mass '' is comparable between models .",
    "@xmath73 observations by b14 of the leading and trailing apocenters differing by 50 kpc can be explained by a @xmath77 sgr evolving in a @xmath78 mw halo .",
    "the lack of agreement with previous studies is due to the negelect of dynamical friction .",
    "earlier observational inferences of sgr s apocenter ( m03 ; lm10 ; correnti et al .",
    "2010 ) favor lower mass sgr models , specifically a @xmath60 sgr evolving in a @xmath79 mw halo .",
    "@xmath73 if the observations of b14 have identified the farthest point in sgr s tidal stream , sgr masses exceeding @xmath65 are definitely excluded .",
    "considering 2mass measures of sgr s apocenter as a lower - bound implies that sgr masses lower than @xmath66 are also excluded , for milky way masses in the range of @xmath80 .",
    "a precise determination of the uncertainties associated with these various measures of sgr s apocenters ( that currently ranges over a factor of @xmath81 ) , along with deeper measures of sgr s tidal debris , will allow for the mass of the milky way and the projenitor mass of the sgr dwarf to be better constrained .",
