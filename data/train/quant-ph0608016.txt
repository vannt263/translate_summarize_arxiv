    "alice and bob want to convince a referee with probability @xmath6 that they have a @xmath7-colouring of a graph @xmath8 in the interrogation model : they each get asked a vertex @xmath9 , @xmath10 of the graph , respectively and have to report back a colour @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( resp . ) to the referee ( _ i.e. _ , a number in @xmath13=\\{0,1,\\ldots , c-1\\}$ ] ; if @xmath14 , then to pass they have to reply the same : @xmath15 ; if @xmath16 , then to pass they have to reply differently : @xmath17 . in this paper , a graph will always be undirected and without loops , i.e.  @xmath18 .    if they are not allowed to talk to each other during the interrogation but may agree on a strategy beforehand , then it is straightforward to see that they can pass with probability @xmath6 if and only if @xmath19 , the chromatic number of @xmath20  that is , in a classical world where alice and bob may share randomness and an otherwise deterministic strategy",
    "however , if alice and bob share an entangled state ( possibly depending on the graph ) , there are graphs for which alice and bob can win this game with probability @xmath6 for @xmath21 . based on a suggestion of one of the authors",
    "( also , independently of patrick hayden , see  @xcite ) we call the smallest @xmath7 such that alice and bob can win the graph colouring game the _ quantum chromatic number_.    such a problem was first considered in  @xcite , and generalised in  @xcite , theorems 8.5.1 - 3 , and  @xcite , for hadamard graphs : the vertices are @xmath22-bit strings , and two of them are joined by an edge if and only if their hamming distance is @xmath23 . in these references",
    "it is shown that the game can be won with @xmath24 colours .",
    "this line of investigation was carried further under the heading `` pseudotelepathy '' in  @xcite .",
    "earlier work of frankl and rdl  @xcite in extremal combinatorics established that the chromatic number of the hadamard graphs grows exponentially in @xmath22 . in",
    "@xcite it is shown that the chromatic number is equal to @xmath22 if and only if @xmath25 .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : models ] we present the model , or actually an infinite hierarchy of models for the quantum chromatic number .",
    "then we go on to general properties of the quantum chromatic number in section  [ sec : general ] , bounds via orthogonal representations ( section  [ sec : orth ] ) , small number of colours ( section  [ sec : few ] ) , and finally random graphs ( section  [ sec : random ] ) , after which we conclude with a number of open questions and conjectures .",
    "the most general strategy for alice and bob to win the graph colouring game with probability @xmath6 with @xmath7 colours for a graph @xmath8 consists of an entangled state @xmath26 shared between them , and two families of povms @xmath27 and @xmath28 , indexed by the vertices @xmath29 of the graph .",
    "the fact that they win with probability @xmath6 is expressed by the consistency condition @xmath30 note that the dimension @xmath31 bears no relationship to @xmath7 , that the entangled state @xmath32 can be anything ( it may even be mixed but it is immediate that w.l.o.g .",
    "we may assume it to be pure ) , and the povms may have operators of arbitrary rank .",
    "the smallest possible @xmath7 for which alice and bob can convince the referee , i.e.  such that eq .",
    "( [ eq : consistency ] ) holds , is called the _ quantum chromatic number _ of @xmath20 and it will be denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "[ prop : normalform ] to win the graph colouring game in the above setting , w.l.o.g .",
    "the state is maximally entangled , and the povm elements are all projectors , all w.l.o.g .  of the same rank .    without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that @xmath34 has full schmidt rank @xmath31 since otherwise we restrict all povms to the supports of the respective reduced states .",
    "from eq .",
    "( [ eq : consistency ] ) we get , for any @xmath29 , any @xmath35 and @xmath36 , that @xmath37 , hence @xmath38 from this , and because alice needs to get outcome @xmath35 with certainty if bob gets @xmath35 , we must have @xmath39 by the same argument all @xmath40 are projectors .    now we argue that the consistency requirement for the state @xmath32 implies that it is also true when we substitute the maximally entangled state @xmath41 : in its schmidt basis , @xmath42 , and denoting @xmath43 , the finding of the previous paragraph can be cast as @xmath44 this implies however @xmath45 for all @xmath9 and @xmath46 ( where we cancelled @xmath47 s left and right ) , and likewise for @xmath48 . but with the fact that each @xmath49 is a projector and that summed over @xmath35 they yield the identity , this gives ( for arbitrary @xmath9 ) @xmath50 from which it follows that @xmath51 commutes with all the ( kraus ) operators @xmath49 , and likewise @xmath52  @xcite . hence we find @xmath53 and that is the claim we set out to prove : we may as well assume that @xmath34 is maximally entangled .    finally , how to make the operators all the same rank : let @xmath54 , and @xmath55 where the colours are w.l.o.g .",
    "@xmath56 and the additions above are modulo @xmath7",
    ". these states and operators evidently still make for a valid quantum colouring , and also clearly all operators have now the same rank .",
    "this proposition motivates us to introduce rank-@xmath57 versions of the quantum chromatic number : @xmath58 is the minimum @xmath7 such that alice and bob can win the graph colouring game for @xmath20 with a maximally entangled state of rank @xmath59 , and povms with operators of rank @xmath57 ( exactly ) .",
    "then it is clear that @xmath60 whenever @xmath61 , and that @xmath62 .    the special case of rank-@xmath6 model is the following : alice and bob share a @xmath7-dimensional maximally entangled state @xmath63 to make their choices , they both use rank-@xmath6 von neumann measurements , which are ordered bases @xmath64 and @xmath65 for all vertices @xmath9 , for alice and bob , respectively .    * observation 1 . *",
    "bob s bases are tied to alice s by the demand of consistency : we need , for all @xmath9 and @xmath11 , @xmath66 which enforces @xmath67    * observation 2 . * this means that we can translate the colouring condition into something that only concerns alice s bases : we need , for all @xmath16 and all @xmath35 , @xmath68 because of @xmath69 and observation 1 this can be rewritten as @xmath70    * observation 3 . *",
    "it is convenient to introduce unitary matrices @xmath71 for each vertex @xmath9 , whose columns are just the vectors @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",

    "i.e.  @xmath49 and @xmath81 are orthogonal .",
    "we look at some basic properties of the quantum chromatic number as a graph parameter .",

    ", it would make sense to ask about the complexity of computing @xmath99 , in particular whether it is np - hard , as is computing the chromatic number @xmath167 .",
    "similarly , we found an exponential upper bound on @xmath167 in terms of @xmath168 , but not in terms of @xmath99 . in particular , it is still open whether there exists an ( infinite ) graph @xmath20 with @xmath250 and finite @xmath99 .",

    "finally , an easier but still fascinating problem would be to find the smallest graph ( and the smallest number of colours ) exhibiting a separation between classical and quantum chromatic number . the graph @xmath20 shown in figure [ fig : smallgraph ] has @xmath255 and @xmath233 . by proposition  [ prop : small ] , this is the minimum value of @xmath256 that can achieve such a separation .",

    "<S> we investigate the notion of quantum chromatic number of a graph , which is the minimal number of colours necessary in a protocol in which two separated provers can convince an interrogator with certainty that they have a colouring of the graph .    after discussing this notion from first principles , we go on to establish relations with the clique number and orthogonal representations of the graph . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove several general facts about this graph parameter and find large separations between the clique number and the quantum chromatic number by looking at random graphs . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that there can be no separation between classical and quantum chromatic number if the latter is @xmath0 , nor if it is @xmath1 in a restricted quantum model ; on the other hand , we exhibit a graph on @xmath2 vertices and @xmath3 edges with chromatic number @xmath4 and quantum chromatic number @xmath5 . </S>"
