    "<S> by the method of coupling and girsanov transformation , harnack inequalities [ f .- y . wang , 1997 ] and strong feller property are proved for the transition semigroup associated with the multivalued stochastic evolution equation on a gelfand triple . </S>",
    "<S> the concentration property of the invariant measure for the semigroup is investigated . as applications of harnack inequalities , </S>",
    "<S> explicit upper bounds of the @xmath0-norm of the density , contractivity , compactness and entropy - cost inequality for the semigroup are also presented .    * </S>",
