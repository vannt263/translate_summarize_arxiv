    "it is by now well - established by radial velocity ( rv ) surveys that the mass function of low - mass companions to normal ( gkm ) stars in the solar neighborhood exhibits a `` brown - dwarf ( bd ) desert , '' a paucity of @xmath6 companions .",
    "specifically , @xmath7 of solar - type stars have bd companions with semi - major axes @xmath8 ( marcy & butler 2000 ) .",
    "although rv surveys will eventually be able to detect more distant companions , the duration of their observations are currently only sufficient to detect long - term trends from companions with @xmath9 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "young bd companions with separations greater than a few tens of aus and less than a few hundreds of aus can be detected via direct imaging surveys ( oppenheimer et  al .",
    "2001 , lowrance 2001 , mccarthy 2001 ) ; even more distant companions are detectable serendipitously in wide - field surveys ( gizis et  al .",
    "these studies seem to suggest that the frequency of wide bd companions to gkm stars is @xmath10 ( see mccarthy 2001 ) .",
    "neither rv nor direct imaging can currently assess the frequency of companions with @xmath11 .",
    "the exquisite precision ( @xmath12 ) of rv surveys also makes them sensitive to planetary companions with mass @xmath13 ; currently nearly 100 such companions are now known .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath15 of these companions are shown in figure 1 .",
    "there also appears to be a statistically significant dearth of high - mass ( @xmath16 ) , close - in ( @xmath17 ) planetary companions ( zucker & mazeh 2002 ; see also figure 1 ) .",
    "whether this is related to the bd desert is not clear .",
    "microlensing is sensitive to binary , bd , and planetary companions separated by @xmath18 from the objects in the galactic bulge which serve as the lenses of microlensing events detected toward the galactic bulge ( mao & paczyski 1991 ) .",
    "the majority of the primaries are likely to be m - dwarfs in the bulge , with some contamination from stellar remnants and disk stars .",
    "microlensing is sensitive to the mass ratio @xmath19 and projected separation @xmath20 of binary systems , where @xmath20 is in units of the combined einstein ring radius @xmath21 of the system .",
    "i will assume that the primaries are m - dwarfs with @xmath22 in the bulge , so that @xmath23 , and use these to transform to the mass @xmath24 and semi - major axis @xmath15 of the secondaries .",
    "the collaborations that survey the galactic bulge generally have insufficient sampling ( @xmath3 ) to detect the deviations caused by planetary companions to the primary lenses , which last for a fraction @xmath25 of the total event duration , or @xmath26 for typical parameters . however , these surveys reduce their data real - time , allowing them to issue alerts of ongoing events .",
    "follow - up collaborations can then monitor only promising events and optimize exposure times and sampling on an event - by - event basis .",
    "several such collaborations have demonstrated that the precision and sampling needed to detect jupiter - mass companions is readily achievable ( rhie et  al .",
    "2000 ; albrow et  al .",
    "2001 ; tsapras et  al .",
    "2001 , bond et  al.2002 ) .    analyzing events for the presence of planetary signals",
    "is made considerably easier by the perturbative nature of the planetary signal for @xmath27 : such events are well - described by short - duration deviations atop otherwise normal ( single - lens ) lightcurves . therefore , selecting the sample of events suitable for analysis is straightforward , and searching for planetary signals and determining detection efficiencies is also considerably less complicated and time - consuming .",
    "a detailed analysis of 43 events monitored by the planet collaboration uncovered no candidate planetary signals .",
    "this null result was used to place an upper limit to the fraction of lenses that hosted companions .",
    "figure 1 shows the region of parameter space in which @xmath28 of m - dwarfs in the bulge can have companions at 95% confidence ( albrow et  al .",
    "2001 , gaudi et  al.2002 ) .",
    "for @xmath29 , the perturbative nature of the companion begins to break down , and the resulting lightcurves begin to exhibit considerably more complexity .",
    "this introduces several complications to the analysis .",
    "first , the relation between the lightcurve parameters and the observable features is no longer straightforward .",
    "this means that it is difficult to estimate parameters without detailed fitting ; however detailed fitting is generally quite difficult because of the highly pathological nature of the @xmath30 surface .",
    "these difficulties are exacerbated in densely - sampled , high - quality lightcurves , which tend to sample high - magnification portions of the lightcurve , whose precise shape depend sensitively on minute variations in the underlying parameters . furthermore , since a large portion of such lightcurves will appear anomalous , they will generally be recognized early on , and thus preferentially followed by the follow - up collaborations .",
    "this introduces hard - to - quantify selection biases .",
    "therefore , it is likely to be considerably easier to study @xmath29 companions with survey photometry , since it will be more amenable to global brute - force analysis methods and less - prone to selection biases ( jaroszyski 2002 ) .",
    "the number of events that must be analyzed to give interesting constraints on bd companions depends on the sensitivity of survey - quality photometry .",
    "i estimate this by determining the detection efficiency as a function of ( @xmath31 ) , assuming uniform daily sampling from 60 days before until 60 days after the peak , an event timescale of 20 days , a photometric accuracy of @xmath32 , and a uniform distribution of impact parameters up to @xmath33 .",
    "the resulting contours of constant detection efficiency are shown in figure 1 .",
    "i find that @xmath1 of bd @xmath34 ) companions with separations @xmath35 are detectable with survey photometry .",
    "therefore , in @xmath36 microlensing events , the number of bd detections is approximately @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the frequency of bds with @xmath39 .",
    "ogle - iii ( http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/@xmath40ftp/ogle/ ) should detect @xmath41 events per year ( udalski et  al .",
    "2002 ) ; therefore fractions of @xmath42 can be probed in the next few years .",
