    "at very high energies @xmath3 in the small-@xmath4-region the multi - regge - kinematics ( mrk ) respectively the quasi - mrk ( qmrk ) is an especially suited approximation for the calculation of lepto- and hadroproduction cross sections .",
    "we consider the central heavy quark - antiquark - hadroproduction process in figs .",
    "[ fig1],[fig2 ] and choose the frame where the proton momenta are given by @xmath5 in the qmrk we have then an almost transverse momentum transfer @xmath6 and for the t - channel momenta the relations @xmath7 but in general no strong ordering of the momenta of the produced heavy quark and antiquark @xmath8 .",
    "this kinematics corresponds to the production of a @xmath9-cluster with finite invariant mass and therefore makes the production of a @xmath10-bound state possible .",
    "the associated factorization scheme is the @xmath11-factorization and the particles in the t - channel are allowed to have finite transverse momenta .",
    "the cross section for the inclusive hadroproduction of a @xmath9-pair at very high energies where gluon exchange dominates is then given by @xmath12    the most important parts of this equation are the hard scattering amplitude @xmath13 and the unintegrated gluon distribution function @xmath14 , where the longitudinal momentum fractions are defined as usual , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . due to the qmrk the gluons are off - shell and longitudinal , which corresponds to the replacement @xmath17 e.g. for the numerator of the upper gluon propagator .",
    "the use of the qmrk and off - shell gluons together with the requirement of gauge invariance determines the @xmath9-production amplitude @xmath13 in terms of the nlla bfkl production vertex @xmath18 , which is explicitely given by fadin and lipatov in @xcite @xmath19 where the function @xmath20 is defined through @xmath21 and a very similar equation holds for the crossed contribution @xmath22 .",
    "equation ( [ b ] ) includes in the second part on the right hand side the effective gluon - production - vertex @xmath23 the first term of the right hand side of this equation is the standard three - gluon - coupling , while the second term in curly brackets is an additional part which is essential for gauge invariance . the function @xmath24 satisfies the ward - slavnov - indentity @xmath25 , and gauge invariance leads to the vanishing of the amplitude @xmath26 in the limit of vanishing transverse momentum .    in order to be able to perform a reasonable comparison to experimental data we use the unintegrated gluon distribution function @xmath27 which has been calculated in @xcite .",
    "the authors extracted @xmath28 from a fit to @xmath29 data and obtained an excellent @xmath30ndof with the use of the following integrated gluon distribution at an input scale of @xmath31gev@xmath32@xmath33 which enters the calculation through the relation @xmath34 for a correct treatment of the region of small transverse gluon momenta @xmath35 we have to modify the cross section formular ( [ crosssection2 ] ) in a way which is compatible with equation ( [ integrated ] ) and the vanishing of the amplitude in the limit @xmath36 , for details see @xcite .",
    "our result for the production of a single bottom quark is shown in fig .",
    "[ singleb ] in comparison to data from the tevatron collider @xcite and nlo calculations in the collinear approach .",
    "the error band is due to a simultaneous variation of the bottom quark mass @xmath37 gev @xmath38 gev and the fundamental scale @xmath39 mev@xmath40 mev , while the scale dependence of the coupling constant @xmath41 is chosen to be @xmath42 .",
    "we find in contrast to the nlo collinear calculation a good agreement between the @xmath43-factorization prediction and the experimental values over the whole range of @xmath44 .",
    "likewise important is the comparison to measurements of @xmath45-correlations @xcite in fig .",
    "[ bbbar65 ] .",
    "allthough the cross section ( [ crosssection2 ] ) is only of lo in @xmath46 , the @xmath11-factorization together with the effective production vertex and off - shell gluons gives a very good despription of the data which lie about a factor of 3 above the nlo collinear result .",
    "motivated by the results for heavy quark production we now pass over to the hadroproduction of charmonia which is a far more controversial subject @xcite .",
    "we consider the production of the @xmath47 , which is a @xmath48-state and the @xmath49 which is a @xmath50 state in the framework of the non - relativistic - qcd ( nrqcd ) approach and have therefore to include the color singlet and color octet contributions to the final color singlet bound states .",
    "the calculation is again based on the cross section formula ( [ crosssection2 ] ) and the unintegrated gluon distribution from @xcite .",
    "the details of the calculations and the binding mechanisms @xmath51 are explained in .",
    "because the color octet contributions depend linearly on the so called color octet matrix elements ( come ) which at the moment can not be calculated but have to be fitted to the data @xcite , the following results should not to be seen as predictions of the corresponding differential cross sections but are required in order to extract the sizes of the come .",
    "the results for the production of the @xmath52 from radiative @xmath47-decay in the @xmath11-factorization are shown on the left side of fig .",
    "[ chi ] together with experimental data from the tevatron and a nlo collinear calculation .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the @xmath53-contribution to @xmath47 is generally suppressed due to the flat slope of the curve in comparison to the data .",
    "the flat curve originates from the additional part of the effective vertex in equation ( [ vertex ] ) which contains factors @xmath6 and leads to a strong suppression of the corresponding come with respect to the results from collinear calculations .",
    "furthermore the landau - yang - theorem , forbidding the production of the @xmath54-state in lo collinear factorization , is not valid in our approach because the gluons are off - shell .",
    "this becomes obvious in a rather impressive way on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ chi ] where the individual @xmath54- and @xmath55-contributions are plotted .",
    "[ jpsi ] shows our results for direct @xmath56-production in the @xmath11-factorization framework in comparison to data and the nlo color singlet collinear prediction @xcite .",
    "although in this case the color octet contributions @xmath57 , @xmath58 play an important role , the @xmath53-part is suppressed following the same reasons as in the @xmath47-production .",
    "this leads again to a strong reduction of the corresponding come @xmath59 with respect to the collinear result .",
    "this in turn has a definite influence on the production of polarized @xmath56 @xcite and could clarify the so far unsolved puzzle concerning the disagreement between recent experimental results and the nlo collinear predictions of transversally polarized charmonia @xcite .",
