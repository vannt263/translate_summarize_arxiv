    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are short , intense , and non - repeating flashes of @xmath0 @xmath1-rays with a wide range of spectral and temporal properties .",
    "grbs were discovered serendipitously by the _ vela _",
    "satellites starting in 1967 @xcite , leading to an intense investigation of their origin , energy source , and progenitor systems that is still on - going at the present . despite the broad diversity in their @xmath1-ray emission properties ( peak energy , spectral shape , variability timescale , duration ) ,",
    "it was recognized primarily based on data from the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on - board the compton gamma - ray observatory that grbs can be generally divided into two groups based on their duration and spectral hardness : the short - hard and long - soft bursts , with a separation at about 2 sec @xcite .    for both grb classes ,",
    "the uniform projected distribution of the bursts on the sky and the fluence distribution ( the so - called @xmath2 or @xmath3 distributions ) pointed to a cosmological origin ( e.g. , @xcite ) . despite these statistical tests ,",
    "the distance scale of grbs continued to be debated at least into the mid-1990s @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - repeating nature of grbs , their harder non - thermal spectra , and non - euclidean space distribution separated them from the soft @xmath1-ray repeaters ( sgrs ; e.g. , @xcite ) , which originate from magnetars in the milky way and nearby galaxies @xcite ; it is important to note , however , that some events classified as short grbs may represent extragalactic giant sgr flares with a long recurrence timescale @xcite .    in the framework of a cosmological origin , the large energy release ( up to an isotropic - equivalent value of @xmath4 erg ) , short variability timescale ( down to milliseconds ) , and observed non - thermal @xmath1-ray spectra led to the `` compactness problem '' ; namely , the observed properties result in an enormous optical depth to pair - production , and hence an expected thermal emission @xcite .",
    "a key result in grb research was the realization that this problem can be resolved by invoking relativistic expansion with a large bulk lorentz factor of @xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the large lorentz factor in turn requires exceedingly clean explosions with ejecta masses of @xmath6 m@xmath7 , the so - called baryon loading problem @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was recognized that the interaction of the relativistic outflow with the surrounding medium will generate synchrotron emission ranging from radio to x - rays , with a longer duration than the prompt @xmath1-ray emission ",
    "the `` afterglow '' @xcite .",
    "the detection of such afterglow emission became an intense pursuit since it held the key to precise positions and hence a distance scale to the bursts .",
    "motivated in part by the @xmath8 gyr merger timescale of the hulse - taylor binary @xcite , seminal studies by @xcite and @xcite pointed out that neutron star binary mergers may lead to @xmath1-ray emission with an energy scale of @xmath9 erg , typical of a cosmological grb .",
    "such mergers are also expected to result in an outflow with a low baryon load due to the absence of a dense surrounding environment , and can therefore drive relativistic outflows",
    ". a more detailed investigation of the neutron star binary merger model was carried out by @xcite , who pointed out that testable predictions include significant offsets from the host galaxies due to natal kicks imparted to the binaries at birth , and gravitational wave emission in the frequency range of the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) . @xcite and @xcite also proposed these mergers as a potential site for @xmath10-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "subsequent to these initial studies , a wide range of investigations of neutron star binary ( ns - ns ) and neutron star black hole binary ( ns - bh ) mergers were carried out with the aim of exploring their gravitational wave emission , the production of @xmath10-process enriched ejecta , and the possible production of grbs . in parallel , an alternative model of grbs from core - collapse supernovae ( the collapsar model )",
    "was developed @xcite , with clear predictions about the resulting population that included an exclusive origin in star - forming galaxies and association with core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the major breakthrough in the study of grbs , their distance and energy scale , environments , and progenitors came from the eventual discovery of afterglows from long grbs starting in 1997 @xcite .",
    "the localization of the bursts to arcminute scale ( in x - rays ) and to sub - arcsecond scale ( in optical and radio ) , led to redshift measurements from optical spectroscopy of the afterglows and host galaxies , which directly demonstrated a cosmological origin @xcite .",
    "the afterglow emission also provided observational evidence for relativistic expansion @xcite , jet collimation with typical opening angles of @xmath11 @xcite , a beaming - corrected energy scale of @xmath12 erg @xcite , and a typical circumburst density of @xmath13 @xmath14 with evidence for mass loss from the massive progenitor stars in some cases @xcite .",
    "in addition , follow - up studies of the hosts demonstrated an exclusive location in star - forming galaxies @xcite , while high resolution imaging with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) showed that long grbs follow the radial distribution expected for star formation in disk galaxies @xcite , and are spatially correlated with bright star - forming regions in their hosts @xcite . moreover , long grbs were shown to be associated with type ic supernovae , based on both photometric and spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "taken together , the environments and supernova associations indicated that long grbs arise from the death of massive stars , and not from compact object binary mergers .    despite the impressive pace of discovery for long grbs , the study of short grbs proved much more challenging , although compact object binary mergers remained an attractive progenitor model .",
    "@xcite carried out rapid but shallow optical follow - up of three short grbs , with non - detections to a limit of @xmath15 mag .",
    "@xcite presented deeper optical follow - up ( to limits of @xmath16 mag with a delay of @xmath17 d ) and the first radio follow - up ( to limits of about @xmath18 mjy with a similar delay ) for four short grbs , but none were detected . in light of the existing afterglow detections summarized in this review , these early searches were woefully inadequate .",
    "at the same time , @xcite argued that a lower energy scale , and potentially lower circumburst densities , will result in dimmer afterglows than for long grbs , by at least an order of magnitude ( e.g. , typical optical brightness of @xmath19 mag at 10 hours post - burst ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite argued based on compact object binary population synthesis models that due to kicks such mergers will tend to occur in lower density environments than long grbs ( @xmath8 @xmath14 ) , and hence lead to fainter afterglows , if they indeed produced short grbs .",
    "as in the case of long grbs , the watershed moment in the study of short grbs came with the discovery of the first afterglows in may ",
    "july 2005 , following bursts from the _ swift _ @xcite and hete-2 @xcite satellites .",
    "rapid  x - ray telescope follow - up of grb050509b led to the discovery of the first x - ray counterpart , with a localization of about @xmath20 radius @xcite .",
    "deep follow - up optical observations revealed no afterglow emission , but instead uncovered a massive elliptical galaxy at @xmath21 near the x - ray error circle , with a chance coincidence probability of @xmath22 @xcite . assuming that the association with the galaxy ( and hence the redshift ) was correct , it was also shown that the burst lacked a supernova @xcite .",
    "shortly thereafter , hete-2 discovered the short grb050709 @xcite , and follow - up observations with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ precisely localized the x - ray afterglow @xcite , with subsequent observations revealing the first short grb optical afterglow @xcite .",
    "the resulting sub - arcsecond position pinpointed the origin of the burst to the outer regions of a star - forming galaxy at @xmath23 @xcite , while optical follow - up ruled out the presence of an associated supernova @xcite .",
    "finally , the detection of the short grb050724 by  @xcite led to the discovery of x - ray , optical / near - ir , and the first radio afterglow , and a definitive localization in an elliptical galaxy at @xmath24 ( figure  [ fig:050724 ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of radio to x - ray afterglow emission also demonstrated that both the energy and density scale were lower than for long grbs @xcite .",
    "taken together , these three early events demonstrated that short grbs are cosmological in origin , that they produce afterglow emission similar to that of long grbs but with a lower energy and density scale , and that their progenitors are not massive stars .    in the decade following the initial discovery of short grb afterglows",
    ", over 70 short grbs have been discovered by  and other @xmath1-ray satellites , with a substantial detection fraction of x - ray and optical afterglows , and a few radio afterglow detections .",
    "the resulting localizations have also led to the identification of nearly 40 host galaxies , and have enabled studies of the sub - galactic locations of short grbs .",
    "this is the first substantial sample of short grbs with extensive afterglow and host galaxy data .",
    "the primary goal of this review is to utilize and synthesize the information from short grb afterglows and environments for the first time in order to : ( i ) delineate the basic observational properties of short grbs and their environments ( from parsec to galactic scales ) ; ( ii ) use this information to confront theoretical progenitor models ; ( iii ) determine some of the basic properties of the progenitors and the resulting explosions ; and ( iv ) explore the expected electromagnetic counterparts of advanced ligo / virgo gravitational wave sources in the context of compact object binary progenitors .    in this vein ,",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : prompt ] i summarize the basic properties of the prompt @xmath1-ray emission , compare these with the @xmath1-ray properties of long grbs , and discuss the issue of short versus long grb classification . in  [ sec : prog ] i describe current short grb progenitor models . in  [ sec : sample ] i define the existing sample of short grbs , including the completeness for afterglow and host galaxy detections . in  [ sec : nonmassive ] i summarize basic observational arguments for a distinct origin from the massive star explosion that produce long grbs . in  [ sec : hosts ] i provide a detailed analysis of short grb host galaxy properties , and use this information to shed light on the age distribution of the progenitors . in  [ sec : subgal ] i zoom in on the sub - galactic locations of short grbs in terms of their radial offset distribution and their spatial relation to the underlying ultraviolet and optical light distribution of their hosts , and compare these results with the location of long grbs and supernovae , and with predictions from compact object binary population synthesis models . in ",
    "[ sec : afterglow ] i turn to the afterglow properties in x - rays , optical , and radio , and use a comparison to both long grb afterglows and afterglow theory to provide insight on the energy scale of short grbs , their collimation , and their circumburst environments . in ",
    "[ sec : kilonova ] i discuss the expected production and optical / near - ir emission from @xmath10-process ejecta in compact object binary mergers , and compare these predictions to observations of the short grb130603b , the first burst to show evidence for such emission . in  [ sec : gwem ] i use the inferred properties of short grbs and their afterglows to explore on- and off - axis electromagnetic emission from gravitational wave sources detected by the upcoming advanced ligo / virgo detectors .",
    "i conclude with the key results and a discussion of future directions in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in addition to the comprehensive review of short grbs presented here , i also refer the reader to several previous reviews that provide additional insight on grb theory and observations .",
    "these include a review of grbs in the batse era @xcite ; an early review of long grb afterglow discoveries , the emerging grb - supernova connection , and afterglow theory @xcite ; comprehensive reviews of the prompt emission and afterglow theory @xcite ; a detailed review of the long grb - supernova connection @xcite ; a preliminary review of short grbs , focused primarily on theoretical issues , and including data from the first few well - localized events in 2005 @xcite ; a comprehensive review of short grb progenitor models , primarily compact object mergers and collisions @xcite ; a review of the primary early results from the  satellite , including in part the detections of short grbs @xcite ; and finally , an initial review of short grb galactic and sub - galactic environments @xcite .",
    "the defining feature of grbs among the wide variety of known astrophysical transients is their dominant , non - repeating , and non - periodic prompt @xmath1-ray emission , which displays a rich phenomenology in terms of duration , variability , spectral parameters , fluence , peak flux , temporal and spectral evolution , and various correlations between these parameters . within this broad range of properties ,",
    "the clearest sub - classes are the short - hard and long - soft bursts .",
    "it is important to note that generally the short end of the short grb duration distribution is affected by detector trigger times ( tens of ms ) , while at the long end there is some overlap with the duration distribution of long grbs , such that some events belonging to the short burst progenitor population will have durations of @xmath25 s , while some events with duration of @xmath26 s will have long grb progenitors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , since various instruments measure durations in different energy bands , it is possible that the value of @xmath27 separating short and long grbs varies for each sample ; for example , @xcite suggest that for _ swift _ the division is at @xmath28 s. the effect of cosmological time dilation adds another potential complication , as indicated for example by the high - redshift grbs 080913 ( @xmath29 ) and 090423 ( @xmath30 ) whose observed durations place them in the long grb category , while their rest - frame durations of @xmath31 s are nominally in the short grb range @xcite .",
    "such effects can be potentially mitigated by the use of auxiliary information , motivated in part by our knowledge of long grbs ( e.g. , their association with type ic sne , their exclusive location in star - forming galaxies ) , and partly by expectations for short grb progenitors . in this vein",
    ", @xcite and @xcite advocate a new classification scheme into type i grbs ( compact object mergers ) and type ii grbs ( massive star progenitors ) , motivated by the nomenclature for supernovae . to determine the type of each burst , they argue for the use of information such as redshift , supernova association , host galaxy type and star formation rate , burst offset relative to the host galaxy , the density profile of the circumburst medium , the @xmath1-ray and afterglow energy scale , and a combination of prompt emission properties ( see figure 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite instead advocate the use of a new prompt emission empirical parameter , @xmath32 , with a value of @xmath33 coupled with a rest - frame @xmath34 s separating type i and ii events ; here @xmath35 is the isotropic - equivalent @xmath1-ray energy and @xmath36 is the spectral peak of the prompt emission . @xcite propose a classification scheme based on physical properties of the progenitor systems , for example destructive ( type i ) versus non - destructive ( type ii ) events , with further separation into sub - classes based on the presence or absence of a degenerate object ( and whether it is a neutron star or black hole ) , and membership in a binary system",
    ".    while such classification schemes are potentially more powerful than relying on duration and hardness alone , and in the long run may be essential for a complete mapping of grb progenitors , they also carry the risk of biasing the results .",
    "for example , the requirement of elliptical hosts for type i grbs will obscure the fact that their presumed compact object binary progenitors occur in both star - forming and elliptical galaxies , and may therefore impede the ability to determine properties such as the delay time distribution from the host galaxy demographics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the requirement of a lower energy scale or larger physical offsets for type i grbs will restrict our understanding of the full range of properties spanned by the progenitors and explosions . in the case of a progenitor - based classification scheme ,",
    "it is currently unclear either from observations or from theory how different systems manifest in terms of unique observables , particularly in the context of the prompt @xmath1-ray emission for which even the radiation mechanism has not been conclusively identified . finally , since complete knowledge of the prompt emission , distance scale , afterglow parameters , and host galaxy properties is only available for a small subset of events , it is currently more profitable to begin the investigation of short grbs with a broad sample that may guide future classification schemes and observational follow - up efforts",
    ". ultimately , it is important to recognize that while the analogy with the supernova classification scheme is tempting , that classification is based on spectroscopic signatures that already provide critical ( though not always definitive ) physical insight into the nature of the explosions ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for grbs , on the other hand , the starting point for any classification scheme is the prompt emission , which exhibits many similarities between long and short grbs ( as i discuss below ) , and even after four decades of investigation is not fully understood .",
    "thus , in this review i pursue the simplest approach of studying a sample of short grbs based on a duration cut of @xmath37 s. it is possible that some events in the sample are produced by long grb progenitors , and that some events with @xmath38 s that belong to the short grb progenitor population are not included in the sample .",
    "however , as i discuss in detail in subsequent sections , the overall differences in the resulting short and long grb populations in terms of afterglow and host galaxy properties are sufficiently clear that they both shed light on the nature of short grb progenitors ( despite any marginal contamination ) , and can serve as the basis for future classification schemes by revealing the most relevant and critical differences .      within the context of a duration - based classification scheme , there have been multiple comparative studies of the prompt emission properties of short and long grbs , based on the samples from various instruments , primarily batse , _ swift _ , and most recently _ fermi_. these studies have uncovered both differences and commonalities in the prompt emission of short and long grbs .",
    "below i provide a short overview of these results , and i refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for a more detailed discussion .    in the framework of the phenomenological band function which was constructed to fit the spectrum of the prompt emission @xcite , a key",
    "finding is that short grbs generally have harder spectra than long grbs due to a combination of a shallower low - energy spectral slope , @xmath39 versus @xmath40 , and a higher spectral peak , @xmath41 versus @xmath42 kev ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , these differences are less evident when the sample is restricted to short grbs with the highest peak fluxes @xcite , or when considering only the first @xmath17 s of long grb light curves @xcite .",
    "similarly , the variability timescales of short grbs are comparable to those in the first @xmath17 s of long grbs @xcite .",
    "another difference between short and long grbs is evident in the distribution of spectral lags , which are generally @xmath43 s for long grbs ( i.e. , they exhibit a hard to soft evolution ) , while they are @xmath44 s ( @xmath45 ms ) for short grbs @xcite .",
    "some long grbs also exhibit negligible lags , but those are events with the highest peak luminosities , which are distinct from the zero lag , low peak luminosity short grbs @xcite .",
    "the difference in spectral lags between short and long grbs may ultimately provide another useful prompt emission discriminator in the context of classification schemes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , it has been noted that short grbs occupy a distinct region in the @xmath46 phase - space than long grbs , namely they have lower @xmath35 values for a given @xmath36 than long grbs @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen , however , whether both sub - classes follow a similar relation if only the first @xmath17 s of long grbs are considered when determining their @xmath36 and @xmath35 values .",
    "on the other hand , an overall similarity between short and long grbs has been found in terms of a common inverse correlation between the duration and intensity for individual pulses @xcite .",
    "in addition , short and long grbs appear to follow the same relation between @xmath36 and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "to date only two short grbs have been detected at @xmath48 energies with the _ fermi _ large area telescope .",
    "grb081024b was detected at @xmath49 gev with a slight delay and a duration of about 3 s , compared to @xmath28 s at mev energies @xcite .",
    "even more extreme gev emission ( up to @xmath50 gev ) was observed in grb090510 , with a delay of about 0.6 s and extending to @xmath51 s @xcite . the delayed onset and longer duration of the gev emission in both long and short grbs",
    "have been interpreted as evidence for a hadronic origin @xcite , a synchrotron self - compton origin @xcite , or an afterglow origin @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of some short grbs is the presence of extended @xmath1-ray emission that is softer than the prompt spike , lasts @xmath52 s , and sometimes exhibits a delayed onset .",
    "the presence of such an emission component was first noted in a stacking analysis of batse short grbs by @xcite who demonstrated that the emission was softer than both the prompt spike and long grbs of similar durations .",
    "these authors interpreted the soft extended component as the onset of the x - ray afterglow .",
    "subsequent studies confirmed the presence of extended emission in at least some batse and konus short bursts @xcite .",
    "the presence of soft extended emission in individual bursts garnered attention with the discovery of the first short grb afterglows .",
    "grb050709 exhibited an initial spike with @xmath53 s in the @xmath54 kev band , followed by a pronounced bump in the @xmath55 kev range with a duration of about 130 s , and a larger fluence by about a factor of 2.5 compared to the initial spike @xcite .",
    "a similar component was observed in the grb050724 , with emission in the @xmath56 kev band lasting about 100 s , but accounting for only 10% of the fluence of the initial spike @xcite .",
    "a particularly extreme example is grb080503 , in which the extended emission dominated over the fluence of the prompt spike by a factor of 32 @xcite .",
    "a study by @xcite identified eight batse short bursts with individual detections of extended emission , with a counts ratio relative to the initial spike ranging up to @xmath57 , and an estimated overall dynamic range of this ratio of @xmath58 .",
    "these authors also noted that short grbs with and without extended emission share a negligible spectral lag in the initial spike .",
    "a follow - up study of extended emission in _ swift _ short bursts by @xcite indicated that about one - quarter of the events clearly exhibit extended emission , while the bulk of the remaining events lack such a component .",
    "however , i note that not all of the bursts in their sample have a genuine initial short spike , and the incidence rate of extended emission may be closer to @xmath59 . building on this sample , @xcite argued that bursts with extended emission have durations and pulse profiles in the prompt spike that are @xmath60 times longer than events lacking extended emission , potentially indicative of differences in the central engine .",
    "two other note - worthy events in the context of extended emission and the @xmath27 divide between long and short bursts are grbs 060505 and 060614 , with durations of 4 and 102 s , respectively , low redshifts of 0.089 and 0.125 , and yet no supernova associations to limits of about @xmath61 mag fainter than typical long grb - sne @xcite .",
    "the prompt emission of grb060505 exhibited a significant spectral lag , typical of long grbs , and the burst coincided with a low metallicity and young star - forming region of its late - type host galaxy @xcite , matching the properties of long grb environments .",
    "the @xmath1-ray emission of grb060614 exhibited an initial 5-sec spike with negligible spectral lag , typical of short grbs , followed by extended emission with significant variability , somewhat softer spectrum , and a larger fluence than the prompt spike by about a factor of 5 @xcite .",
    "the host galaxy of grb060614 has a low luminosity typical of long grb hosts , but a lower than average specific star formation rate @xcite .",
    "moreover , the burst itself was located at a significant offset from the host in a region with little evidence for underlying ultraviolet emission @xcite .",
    "thus , grbs 060505 and 060614 present a challenge to any grb classification scheme , with their prompt emission sharing properties typical of both long and short grbs , their host environments similarly spanning locations typical of long and short grbs , and the lack of supernova association suggesting a non - massive star progenitor",
    ".    there have been attempts to discern other differences between the population of short grbs with and without extended emission .",
    "@xcite claim that short bursts with extended emission have larger x - ray fluxes at @xmath62 s post - burst and longer lasting x - ray afterglows .",
    "however , it is not obvious that the x - ray emission at such early times is not directly related to the soft extended emission itself . @xcite used a sample of short grbs up to mid-2007 to argue that events with extended emission have systematically smaller spatial offsets from their hosts , and hence distinct progenitors .",
    "however , subsequent studies of the offset distribution indicate that short grbs with extended emission span as wide an offset range as events with no extended emission @xcite ; a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test comparing the two offset distributions leads to a @xmath63-value of 0.9 , indicating that there is no evidence for two distinct populations @xcite . in addition , @xcite find that the distributions of host galaxy types for short grbs with and without extended emission are currently indistinguishable .",
    "motivated by the discovery of extended emission , several attempts have been made to provide a theoretical explanation .",
    "@xcite propose that short grbs with extended emission are produced by the formation of a rapidly rotating proto - magnetar through accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf , the merger of a white dwarf binary , or the merger of a neutron star binary . in this framework , the prompt spike is due to the standard picture of accretion onto the central object , while the extended emission is powered by a relativistic wind that extracts the proto - magnetar s rotational energy . @xcite",
    "discuss a slight variation of the magnetar model , in which the delay in the onset of extended emission is due to a breakout of the relativistic outflow through a baryon - loaded wind from the proto - magnetar .",
    "@xcite suggest instead that the gap between the prompt spike and extended emission may be due to heating from @xmath10-process nucleosynthesis , which momentarily halts fall - back accretion onto the central object . in this scenario ,",
    "events lacking extended emission are due to a timescale for the @xmath10-process heating of @xmath64 s , which leads to a complete cut - off in fallback accretion , while those with extended emission resume fall - back accretion after a delay . @xcite propose a model in which the short grbs with extended emission are due to the accretion - induced collapse of a neutron star ( generating the prompt spike ) followed by interaction of the relativistic outflow with the non - degenerate stellar companion ( leading to a delay followed by soft extended emission ) .",
    "the discovery of early x - ray flares following the prompt @xmath1-ray emission was enabled by the rapid follow - up capabilities of _ swift _ @xcite .",
    "the x - ray flares generally follow a fast rise exponential decay profile with @xmath65 , and share spectral and temporal properties with the prompt emission , pointing to a common origin in activity from the central engine @xcite ; here , @xmath66 is the flare duration and @xmath67 is the time since the onset of the burst . in the case of short grbs ,",
    "@xcite carried out a systematic search for flares , and found eight _ swift _ events that exhibit flaring activity .",
    "the sample includes bursts with and without extended emission , and in both early- and late - type host galaxies .",
    "the resulting flares follow some of the relations of long grb flares , for example a positive correlation between the flare width and time since the burst . on the other hand ,",
    "the short grb flares are generally weaker in terms of flux contrast relative to the underlying x - ray emission ( with @xmath68 ) , have about 1% of the peak luminosity and isotropic - equivalent energy of long grb flares , and like the prompt emission , do not follow the lag - luminosity relation of long grb flares . the lower peak luminosity compared to long grb flares remains true even when scaled by the peak luminosity of the prompt emission , but short and long grb flares track the same negative correlation between the ratio of peak flare to prompt luminosity as a function of the ratio of flare peak time to burst duration .",
    "potentially related to this point , the ratio of flare to prompt isotropic - equivalent energy is similar for both short and long grbs . given these results , @xcite",
    "conclude that flares in both short and long grbs are related to the prompt emission .",
    "flares and re - brightenings at late time ( @xmath69 ) have also been detected in some short grbs , with distinct properties from the early flares described above .",
    "grb050724 exhibited a significant x - ray flare centered at @xmath70 hr with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , with apparent associated emission in the optical / near - ir @xcite .",
    "the fact that the flare is superposed on an underlying single power law decline suggests a distinct , though currently not understood origin from the afterglow .",
    "a delayed peak was found in the optical ( and potentially x - ray ) emission from grb080503 at @xmath73 day , although the subsequent evolution matched typical afterglow emission rather than a distinct flare @xcite .",
    "finally , excess x - ray emission at @xmath64 d was found in grb130603b , with no corresponding emission in the optical or radio bands , and an apparent single power law behavior compared to the early x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "thus , the late flares and re - brightenings are likely to have a distinct origin from the early rapid x - ray flares .",
    "several ideas have been proposed to explain flares in short ( and long ) grbs .",
    "@xcite suggest that fragmentation in the outer accretion disk , caused by gravitational instabilities , could lead to large amplitude variations of the central engine .",
    "@xcite propose that the flares can be caused by fall - back accretion of material launched into eccentric orbits during a compact object merger ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that the accretion can be episodically stopped and re - started through variations in the accumulated magnetic flux around the accreting central engine .",
    "finally , @xcite propose that the flares can be produced by delayed magnetic reconnection as a strongly magnetized outflow decelerates through interaction with the circumburst medium ; unlike the other proposed models , this scenario does not require a re - activation of the central engine",
    ".      precursor @xmath1-ray emission , preceding the main event by tens of seconds , has been found in @xmath74 of long grbs @xcite , and has been attributed to either the transition of the expanding fireball to the optically thin regime , or to the breakout of the relativistic jet from the surface of the progenitor star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the former scenario is correct , precursors should also be present in short grbs .",
    "in addition , precursors in short grbs may be produced by other mechanisms , for example magnetospheric interaction between the compact objects @xcite or resonant shattering of the neutron star crusts @xcite prior to the merger .",
    "@xcite conducted a search for precursors in 49 _ swift _ short grbs with and without extended emission , and uncovered 5 potential candidates ( with @xmath75 significance ) , of which 3 candidates ( grbs 081024a , 090510 , and 091117 ) had likely independent detections in other satellite data . in those 3 cases ,",
    "the precursor candidates occurred @xmath76 s prior to the main spike , and it is therefore not clear if these emission episodes are indeed distinct precursors , or a part of the prompt emission complex .",
    "the bimodality of grb durations is highly suggestive of two dominant progenitor populations .",
    "the short durations of short grbs , down to tens of milliseconds , point to compact progenitor systems with a dynamical timescale of milliseconds . in this context , the most popular progenitor model is the merger of compact object binaries comprised of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole ( ns - ns / ns - bh ; @xcite ) .",
    "the merger occurs due to angular momentum and energy losses by gravitational wave radiation . in the binary neutron star case ,",
    "the expected remnant is a black hole surrounded by a hyper - accreting disk of debris , while a ns - bh merger can lead to the same configuration if the neutron star is tidally disrupted outside of the black hole s horizon .",
    "the resulting interplay of high accretion rate and rapid rotation can lead to energy extraction via neutrino - antineutrino annihilation or magnetohydrodynamic processes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which in turn drive a collimated relativistic outflow . as discussed in  [ sec : intro ] , ns - ns / ns - bh mergers were proposed as grb progenitors prior to the discovery of the duration bimodality since they provided a known source population with roughly the correct event rate , the requisite rapid release of a large energy reservoir , and a clean environment to avoid significant baryon loading .",
    "the compact object merger model leads to several testable observational predictions .",
    "first , the delay time between the binary formation and eventual merger is expected to span a wide range that depends on the initial separation and consituent masses , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the initial binary separation , @xmath79 is the total binary mass and @xmath80 is the reduced mass . as a result of the wide delay time distribution , the resulting short bursts will occur in both early- and late - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is indeed the case for the small observed population of galactic ns - ns binaries , which have coalescence timescales of tens of myr to much longer than a hubble time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , natal kicks imparted to the binary system during the supernova explosions that gave rise to the neutron stars and/or black hole , coupled with the broad range of merger timescales , should lead to some mergers at large offsets from their birth sites and host galaxies ( tens to hundreds of kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "a broad spatial distribution is also expected if some short grbs result from dynamically - formed binaries in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "third , the mergers will be accompanied by strong gravitational wave emission , detectable with the advanced ligo / virgo detectors to about 200 mpc for ns - ns mergers @xcite .",
    "fourth , the mergers will produce neutron - rich ejecta , which will in turn lead to @xmath10-process nucleosynthesis ; the decay of the resulting radioactive elements may be detectable at optical / near - ir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "finally , the mergers will not be accompanied by supernova explosions .",
    "most of these predictions can now be tested with existing observations of short grbs , as delineated in subsequent sections of this review .    in principle",
    ", some of these properties may differ between ns - ns and ns - bh mergers .",
    "for example , numerical simulations suggest that mergers with a larger mass ratio ( i.e. , ns - bh ) may produce larger ejecta masses , with more pronounced asymmetry that may lead to brighter optical / near - ir counterparts @xcite . similarly ,",
    "since neutron star disruption outside the horizon of a typical black hole with @xmath81 m@xmath7 requires significant black hole spin , the resulting accretion disk will undergo significant lense - thirring precession that may imprint detectable variability on the prompt emission light curve @xcite .",
    "finally , it is possible that the larger masses of ns - bh systems may lead to systematically smaller effective kicks , and hence smaller offsets than for ns - ns mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that to date no ns - bh binaries have been identified in nature , and it is therefore not clear if they contribute to the short grb population at all , whether any of the predicted differences match the actual properties of ns - bh binaries , and if the differences relative to ns - ns binaries are significant enough to be discernible in the existing short grb sample .",
    "these questions may be resolved with joint gravitational wave and short grb detections (  [ sec : gwem ] ) .    in the ns - ns merger model",
    "it is generally assumed that a black hole is rapidly formed , with the resulting accretion powering the short grb and its afterglow .",
    "however , the recent discovery of neutron stars with masses of about 2 m@xmath7 @xcite , suggest that some mergers may lead instead to a transitory or stable rapidly - spinning and highly - magnetized neutron star ( a magnetar ; @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetar can in turn power a short grb through its spin - down energy . in the transitory case ,",
    "as the magnetar spins down it will eventually collapse to a black hole when differential rotation can no longer support its large mass .",
    "this transition could in principle lead to an observable signature ; for example , it has been recently claimed that short - lived x - ray plateaus in some short grbs are due to magnetar spin - down energy injection and the subsequent collapse to a black hole @xcite .",
    "however , fall - back accretion may also explain the plateaus @xcite .",
    "similarly , it is not clear if a stable magnetar can be distinguished from an accreting black hole engine in terms of the resulting prompt and afterglow emission .    given the potential ability of magnetars to provide the required energy source , it has also been proposed that such objects can form , and power short grbs or soft @xmath1-ray repeaters , following the accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf or white dwarf binary mergers @xcite . unlike formation through core - collapse",
    ", such delayed magnetar formation will lead to events in both early- and late - type galaxies , similar to the prediction for ns - ns / ns - bh mergers . however , such systems are not expected to experience significant natal kicks , to be accompanied by gravitational wave emission in the advanced ligo / virgo band , or to produce @xmath10-process radioactive elements .",
    "another proposed progenitor model is accretion - induced collapse of a neutron star to a black hole @xcite , although this model has not been explored in detail .",
    "finally , @xcite suggested that short grbs with extended emission may be produced from the same massive star progenitors as long grbs , but with a wide off - axis viewing angle that leads to predominant emission from the cocoon surrounding the jet . in this model ,",
    "short grbs with extended emission will occur only in star - forming galaxies and will be accompanied by type ic supernovae .",
    "these requirements are violated in several events ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this review i address the properties of short grbs , their afterglows , and environments , by focusing on a sample of @xmath82 events discovered primarily by the  satellite @xcite in the eight - year period spanning january 2005 to january 2013 , supplemented by the recent well - studied benchmark event grb130603b @xcite .",
    "the sample includes three short bursts discovered by hete-2 ( grbs 050709 and 060121 ; @xcite ) and integral ( grb070707 ; @xcite ) for which afterglows and host galaxies have been identified .",
    "this is the first sample of short grbs with a substantial fraction of afterglow detections , enabling studies of both the burst properties and the host galaxies .",
    "a basic summary of the prompt and afterglow emission of these grbs is provided in table  [ tab : afterglows ] .    the most detailed information , both in terms of explosion properties and host galaxy and sub - galactic environments , comes from events localized to sub - arcsecond precision through an optical afterglow detections or a  detection of the x - ray afterglow ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; radio detections are also a route to sub - arcsecond positions @xcite , but to date all short grbs detected in the radio have also been detected in the optical . /xrt positions alone , generally with a precision of @xmath83 ,",
    "are also useful for host identifications @xcite .",
    "however , for these bursts the availability of only x - ray data limits the extraction of afterglow properties , and the positions are not precise enough to locate the bursts within their hosts .    in this vein , of the @xmath84  short grbs considered here ,",
    "53 events were rapidly followed up with the on - board x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on a timescale of @xmath85 s , leading to 47 detections ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "this is only slightly lower than the detection rate for long grbs .",
    "it is important to note that the 6 undetected events had a lower than average @xmath1-ray fluence of @xmath87 erg @xmath88 and may therefore simply be fainter events .",
    "two of the three non-  events ( grbs 060121 and 070707 ) were also followed up with the xrt and both were detected , enabling the subsequent identification of optical afterglows .",
    "the third non-  event ( grb050709 ) was detected in the x - rays with  @xcite .",
    "of the 50 total x - ray detections , @xmath89 events ( @xmath90 ) exhibit long - term x - ray emission beyond @xmath91 s , while the remaining 22 events rapidly fade below the /xrt detection threshold at @xmath92 s. the /xrt positions span a range of @xmath93 radius , with a median value of @xmath94 ( @xmath95 confidence ) .",
    "these positions are generally sufficient for a robust identification of host galaxies with a probability of chance coincidence of @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "finally , the 14 bursts lacking rapid xrt follow - up include 8 events with  observing constraints , and 6 events with delayed follow - up ( @xmath64 hr post - burst ) . thus , the lack of x - ray detections for these events is not expected to bias the sample considered here .",
    "deep optical follow - up observations were obtained for @xmath97 of the @xmath98  bursts with xrt positions , leading to @xmath99 detections ( @xmath100 ) with a range of about @xmath101 mag at @xmath102 hr .",
    "it is remarkable that the optical afterglow detection fraction is comparable to that for long grbs despite the relative faintness of short grb afterglows .",
    "this is a testament to the concerted follow - up effort undertaken by the community over the past decade , utilizing the largest ground - based telescopes .",
    "the three non-  events were also detected in the optical .",
    "of the 10 events lacking deep optical follow - up , 6 events were located along constrained galactic sight - lines with large extinction and/or contaminating bright stars , while the other 4 events lack deep afterglow and host galaxy searches at the present .",
    "thus , as in the case of missing x - ray follow - up , these events are not expected to bias the sample considered here .",
    "the 16 bursts with deep follow - up and no detected optical afterglows typically have limits of @xmath19 mag at @xmath103 hr , comparable to the median brightness of the detected afterglows ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as i demonstrate in  [ sec : afterglow ] these events do not appear to be distinct from those with detected afterglows , suggesting that the searches were likely too shallow .",
    "in addition , 2 of the 16 events with optical non - detections ( grbs 111020a and 111117a ) were subsequently detected with leading to sub - arcsecond positions @xcite .",
    "finally , radio observations have been obtained for @xmath89 short grbs ( including some non-  bursts and  bursts with only @xmath1-ray positions ) leading to only three detections to date ( @xmath104 ; grbs 050724a , 051221a , and 130603b : @xcite ) .",
    "this is a low detection fraction compared to long grbs ( with @xmath105 ; @xcite ) , but it is not surprising considering that radio follow - up is generally sensitivity - limited even for long grbs . as i discuss in  [ sec : afterglow ] , despite the low detection fraction , the radio limits are generally useful for placing constraints on the circumburst densities of short grbs .    in addition to afterglow follow - up observations , there has been an intensive effort to characterize the environments of short grbs from sub - galactic to galaxy cluster scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sample presented in this paper includes nearly 40 identified host galaxies , with about 30 redshift measurements .",
    "a subset of these galaxies have detailed measurements that include morphologies , stellar masses , stellar population ages , star formation rates , and metallicities ( see table  [ tab : hosts ] ) .",
    "in addition , for about 20 events ( those with sub - arcsecond afterglow localizations ) there are precise measurements of the sub - galactic environments based on _ hst _ observations , including projected offsets and the brightness at the grb location relative to the underlying light distribution of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "two key observations helped to establish the connection between long grbs and the deaths of massive stars ( the collapsar model ; @xcite ) : ( i ) the association of long grbs with type ic core - collapse supernovae @xcite ; and ( ii ) the exclusive locations of long grbs in star - forming galaxies @xcite , as well as their spatial offsets relative to their hosts overall light distribution and their coincidence with bright star - forming regions within their hosts @xcite .",
    "the sn associations are based on spectroscopic observations , mainly at @xmath106 where the spectroscopic signatures can be discerned with sufficient significance ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and on photometric re - brightenings on a timescale of @xmath107 d post - burst that match type ic sn light curves in both brightness and color ( to @xmath108 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed distribution of long grb - sn peak magnitudes is relatively narrow , spanning only about @xmath109 mag for the bulk of the sample @xcite .",
    "moreover , long grb - sne are generally more luminous than normal type ib / c sne @xcite , although there is some overlap in the distributions .",
    "these results are summarized in figure  [ fig : sne ] in which i plot the peak absolute magnitudes of grb - sne and type ib / c sne relative to the canonical sn1998bw associated with grb980425 . in terms of spatial locations within their hosts , long grbs radially track an exponential light distribution , typical of star formation in disk galaxies , with a median offset of about one half - light radius @xcite . moreover , long grbs are spatially correlated with bright star - forming regions , even in comparison to normal core - collapse sne @xcite .      in the short grb sample defined in  [ sec : sample ] there are several events at sufficiently low redshifts to allow clear detections of associated sne , yet none have been found to date @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : sne ] i plot all existing upper limits for associated sne ( for 7 short bursts ) , measured relative to the peak absolute magnitude of the canonical long grb - sn1998bw .",
    "i also plot the limits for the peculiar events grbs 060505 and 060614 . as can be seen from the figure , sne associated with long grbs span a narrow peak brightness range , with a median and standard deviation relative to sn1998bw of @xmath110 mag . on the other hand , the upper limits on sn associations for short grbs range from 0.6 to 7.4 mag fainter than sn1998bw ; grbs 060505 and 060614 have limits of 6.9 and 6.4 mag fainter than sn1998bw , respectively .",
    "thus , in all cases an associations with sne that are drawn from the same distribution as long grb - sne can be ruled out .",
    "this demonstrates that short and long grbs do not share a common progenitor system , and that at least the short grbs with deep sn limits are not produced by massive star explosions .",
    "it is also important to note that of the 7 short bursts with limits on associated sne , 6 events are located in star - forming galaxies , indicating that while the hosts exhibit on - going star formation activity , the short grb progenitors themselves do not belong to a young population of massive stars .",
    "i return to this point in  [ sec : subgal ] when discussing the locations of short grb within and around their host galaxies .",
    "the dominance of star - forming hosts in the sample of short grbs lacking sn associations indicates that the use of galaxy type as an indicator of progenitor type ( as advocated for example by @xcite ) can severely bias the resulting grb classification .",
    "in particular , a star - forming host does not indicate a young massive star progenitor . in a similar vein",
    ", i note that two of the short bursts with sn non - detections ( grbs 051221a and 070724a ) are claimed to be likely collapsars according to the duration - hardness analysis of @xcite , and a third event ( grb080905a ) has a duration that is longer than their nominal divide between short and long grbs ( see inset of figure  [ fig : sne ] ) .",
    "the fact that these events lack associated sne casts doubt on the claimed statistical significance of a collapsar origin assigned to individual events in their analysis .",
    "the second clear distinction between the short and long grb populations is the occurrence of some short grbs in elliptical galaxies ( figure  [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "the current short grb sample includes two secure cases of elliptical host galaxies based on sub - arcsecond afterglow positions and spatially coincident hosts ( grbs 050724a and 100117a ; @xcite ) , two additional cases with sub - arcsecond afterglow positions and likely elliptical hosts with large projected offsets ( grbs 070809 and 090515 ; @xcite ) , and four additional likely cases ( probabilities of about @xmath111 ) based on /xrt positions alone ( grbs 050509b , 060502b , 070729 , 100625a ; @xcite ) .",
    "overall , about 20% of short grbs are associated with early - type host galaxies @xcite . in nearly all cases ,",
    "the identification of the hosts as early - type galaxies is based on spectroscopic observations that reveal no star formation activity ( to @xmath112 m@xmath7 yr@xmath113 ) , optical / near - ir spectral energy distributions that are matched by a single stellar population with an age of @xmath114 gyr , and/or morphological information based on _ hst _ observations .",
    "i explore the host galaxy demographics distribution , and its implications for the progenitor population , in the next section , but it is clear from the occurrence of at least some short grbs in elliptical galaxies that he progenitors belong to an old stellar population .",
    "having established that the progenitors of short grbs are generally distinct from those of long grbs based on the lack of sn associations and their occurrence in elliptical galaxies , i now turn to the question of what the progenitors are , and what we can infer about their nature from the properties of the host galaxies . in general , the galaxy - scale and local environments of astrophysical transients provide critical insight into the nature of their progenitors , and this has been used to establish the progenitor properties of various supernova types and long grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this section i contrast the environments of short and long grbs to further demonstrate their distinct origins , and compare the short grb environments to field galaxy populations to establish some of the basic properties of their progenitors .",
    "i also provide a comparison with the hosts of type ia supernovae since these white dwarf thermonuclear explosions are known to arise from an evolved stellar population , with a broad range of delay times @xcite , potentially similar to compact object binary mergers .",
    "a summary of the key properties of short grb host galaxies is provided in table  [ tab : hosts ] .",
    "the data are primarily drawn from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .      at the most basic level ,",
    "host galaxy associations are critical since essentially all short grb redshifts to date ( spectroscopic or photometric ) have been obtained from the associated hosts ( figure  [ fig : spec ] ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sole exceptions are grb090426 at @xmath115 @xcite and grb130603b at @xmath116 @xcite for which redshifts have been determined from afterglow absorption spectra .",
    "the bulk of the measured redshifts span @xmath117 , but it is likely that at least some of the faintest host galaxies ( with optical magnitudes of @xmath118 ) , which lack redshift measurements are located at @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "the redshift distributions of short and long grbs are shown in figure  [ fig : z ] .",
    "the median redshift of the short grb population with established redshifts is @xmath120 , while the addition of faint hosts that are presumably located at @xmath119 increases the median to @xmath121 ; the use of redshift upper limits from afterglow and/or host galaxy detections in optical bands ( i.e. , the lack of a lyman break ) leads to an upper bound on the median redshift of @xmath122 . since only 6 short bursts lack xrt positions despite rapid follow - up (  [ sec : sample ] ) , and hence the ability to identify hosts , the observed redshift distribution robustly represents the redshifts of  short grbs . assuming that the median redshift is @xmath123 , and that it is not affected by the sensitivity threshold of the resulting median progenitor age relative to the peak of the cosmic star formation history ( @xmath124 ) is @xmath125 gyr .",
    "since the observed sample is almost certainly limited by the detector sensitivity , this inferred age can be used as an upper bound .",
    "there is no clear trend between redshift and host galaxy type , with both early- and late - type hosts spanning the same redshift range with similar median values ( figure  [ fig : z ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the progenitors are expected to be systematically older in early - type galaxies and hence to occur at lower redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the similar redshift distributions for early- and late - type galaxies suggest that the  sensitivity threshold indeed plays a role in the redshift distribution .",
    "the short grb population is substantially more local than  long grbs , which extend to @xmath126 @xcite with a median value of @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "this is partly a reflection of the lower energy scale of short grbs , but also a result of longer delay times between star formation activity and the occurrence of short grbs .",
    "an additional constraint on the progenitors and their age distribution is provided by the demographics of the host galaxy sample .",
    "while long grbs only occur in star - forming galaxies @xcite , as expected for young massive star progenitors , short grbs occur in a mixed population of early - type and star - forming galaxies @xcite indicating that their progenitors span a wide range of ages .",
    "more broadly , since at @xmath128 , the redshift range relevant for the existing short grb population , a roughly equal fraction of the cosmic stellar mass density is in early - type and star - forming galaxies @xcite , an exclusively old progenitor population ( i.e. , tracking stellar mass alone ) will also exhibit an equal fraction of early- and late - type hosts . on the other hand",
    ", a progenitor population skewed to relatively short delay times relative to star formation activity ( tens to hundreds of myr ) will exhibit an over - abundance of late - type hosts due to their recent star formation @xcite .",
    "studies of the first few short grb host galaxies from 2005 , led several groups to conclude that early - type galaxies dominate the sample at a ratio of about 2:1 , and that the progenitors are therefore exceedingly old , with a characterstic age of @xmath129 gyr @xcite .",
    "a different conclusion is reached by @xcite in a study of the short grb host galaxy demographics using a much larger sample of 36 events .",
    "these authors find that regardless of various cuts on the sample , only @xmath74 of the hosts are early - type galaxies ( figure  [ fig : demographics ] ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this result is robust when considering only events with sub - arcsecond positions , when including those with xrt positions , or when restricting the sample according to the duration - hardness analysis of @xcite .",
    "the dominance of late - type galaxies indicates that the short grb rate does not depend on stellar mass alone , and is instead influenced by recent star formation activity . comparing the observed relative fraction of early- and late - type hosts to the theoretical predictions of @xcite leads to a power law delay time distribution of @xmath130 .",
    "an additional clue to the role of star formation in the short grb rate is the identification of two short grb hosts as luminous and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( u / lirg ) .",
    "grb100206a is associated with a dusty lirg at @xmath131 @xcite , while grb120804a is associated with a dusty ulirg at a photometric redshift of @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "the expected u / lirg fraction for a progenitor population that tracks stellar mass alone is @xmath133 @xcite , while for progenitors that track only star formation it is @xmath134 @xcite . since the observed fraction in the short grb sample is @xmath135 percent , it suggests that the progenitor population is influenced by both stellar mass and star formation activity , indicative of a broad age distribution .",
    "the distribution of host galaxy stellar masses and stellar population ages can also shed light on the progenitor age distribution .",
    "the stellar masses inferred from modeling of the host optical / near - ir spectral energy distributions with single stellar population models span @xmath136 m@xmath7 .",
    "the median for the full sample is @xmath137 m@xmath7 , while for the star - forming hosts alone it is @xmath138 m@xmath7 ( figure  [ fig : mass ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar masses of long grb hosts are substantially lower , with a median value of about @xmath139 m@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that even the star - forming hosts of short grbs are typically more massive than the hosts of long grbs , pointing to a more dominant role of stellar mass in determining the rate of short grbs .",
    "a comparison to the mass function of field galaxies is even more illuminating . in figure",
    "[ fig : mass ] i compare the cumulative distributions of stellar masses for the early- and late - type hosts of short grbs with the expected distributions for mass - selection from the field galaxy mass function @xcite . for a progenitor population that tracks stellar mass alone",
    ", we expect that the observed stellar mass distribution of short grb hosts will closely track the mass - weighted mass distribution of field galaxies .",
    "while this is indeed the case for the early - type mass function , the late - type hosts of short grbs have systematically lower stellar masses than expected from mass - selection alone @xcite .",
    "this indicates that in late - type galaxies the short grb rate per unit stellar mass is higher than in early - type galaxies , due to the presence of star formation activity .",
    "this agrees with the observed over - abundance of late - type galaxies in the short grb host population .",
    "quantitatively , for a range of host stellar mass determinations , the short grb rate per unit stellar mass in late - type galaxies is about @xmath140 times higher than in early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "the difference between short and long grb hosts is also evident in the distribution of stellar population ages .",
    "the distribution for short grb hosts spans a wide range , from a few tens of myr to about 4 gyr , with a median value of @xmath141 gyr , while the long grb hosts have a median stellar population age of @xmath142 myr ( figure  [ fig : age ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "coupled with the stellar mass distribution discussed above , this indicates that the short grb rate per @xmath143 m@xmath7 in late - type hosts ( with @xmath144 gyr ) and early - type hosts ( with @xmath145 gyr ) is @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively , leading to a power law delay time distribution of @xmath148 , in good agreement with the distribution inferred from the early- to late - type fraction .",
    "similarly , separating the sample into galaxies with stellar population ages younger and older than @xmath149 gyr i find that the typical ages are about 0.1 and 1 gyr , respectively , with a resulting rate per @xmath143 m@xmath7 of 0.8 and 0.12 , respectively , leading to a delay time distribution of @xmath150 .",
    "the inferred delay time distribution is in good agreement with that of galactic neutron star binaries with a power law index of @xmath151 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the interplay of stellar mass and star formation activity in short grb hosts is also evident in the distribution of specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) , relative to both long grb hosts and field star - forming galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr ] i plot the star formation rates ( sfr ) as a function of rest - frame optical @xmath152-band luminosity ( @xmath153 ) for short and long grb hosts . for the short grb",
    "hosts the luminosities span @xmath154 @xmath155 , and the star formation rates span @xmath112 to @xmath156 m@xmath7 yr@xmath113 , with the upper limits corresponding to the early - type hosts ; here @xmath155 is the characteristic luminosity in the schechter function .",
    "however , while both short and long grb hosts exhibit a clear trend between sfr and @xmath153 ( at least for the star - forming short grb hosts ) , the overall normalization ( i.e. , the ssfr ) is lower for the short grb hosts by about a factor of 5 , with @xmath157 m@xmath7 yr@xmath113 @xmath155 .",
    "the k - s test gives a @xmath63-value of 0.003 for the null hypothesis that the short and long grb hosts are drawn from a galaxy population with the same underlying distribution of ssfr .    since the specific star formation rate is the inverse of the characteristic timescale to build up a galaxy s stellar mass , the lower values for short grb hosts indicates that while the majority are star - forming galaxies , their star formation activity is more moderate , and has a longer characteristic timescale than in long grb hosts .",
    "thus , the massive star progenitors of long grbs track recent star formation ( tens of myr ) , while the progenitors of short grbs track star formation with a delay of hundreds of myr to several gyr . moreover , the short grb hosts clearly track the distribution of specific star formation rates in field galaxies of similar luminosities @xcite , with a k - s @xmath63-value of 0.8 , indicating that short grbs select galaxies from the general field sample .",

    "as demonstrated in the previous section , the properties of short grb hosts help to reveal the short grb redshift distribution , to shed light on the progenitor age distribution , and to establish the differences between long and short grb progenitors .",
    "studies of short grb sub - galactic environments can further this insight by providing information on their spatial association ( or lack thereof ) with star formation or stellar mass .",

    "moreover , studies of the rest - frame uv brightness at the locations of long grbs relative to the overall uv light distribution of the hosts have shown that long grbs tend to occur in unusually bright star - forming regions , significantly more so than core - collapse sne @xcite .    what is the expectation for the locations of short grbs ?",
    "as i already demonstrated from the lack of sn associations , the occurrence of some short grbs in elliptical galaxies , and the systematically older stellar population of short grb hosts compared to long grb hosts , short grbs are not expected to coincide with young star - forming environments . on the other hand , based on the distribution of host galaxy stellar masses , and the host galaxy demographics",

    "requires the high angular resolution and superior depth of the _ hst_. a comprehensive study based on _ hst _ observations of 32 short grb host galaxies was carried out by @xcite and @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "data , combined with ground - based optical afterglow observations ( and in two cases , observations ) , provide accurate offsets at the sub - pixel level , and reveal the broad distribution shown in figure  [ fig : offset1 ] .",
    "the projected offsets span @xmath180 kpc with a median of about 5 kpc .",
    "this is about 4 times larger than the median offset for long grbs @xcite , and about 1.5 times larger than the median offsets of core - collapse and type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "in addition , while no long grbs , and only @xmath179 of sne have offsets of @xmath181 kpc , the fraction of short grbs with such offsets is about @xmath182 . for offsets of @xmath178 kpc ,",
    "the fraction of short grbs is about @xmath183 , but essentially no sne exhibit such large offsets .    equally important , the observed offset distribution is in remarkable agreement with the population synthesis predictions for compact object mergers , particularly the fraction of events with large offsets .",
    "i note that the observed distribution is mainly based on short grbs with optical afterglows , which may be skewed on average to higher circumburst densities , and hence to smaller offsets .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that events with only xrt or bat positions ( 14 and 6  short grbs , respectively ;  [ sec : sample ] ) , whose precise offsets can not be ascertained , in reality have systematically larger offsets than a few kpc .",
    "the subset of short grbs with offsets of @xmath178 kpc require specific mention since these offsets are larger than the typical visible extent of galaxies .",
    "these bursts lack coincident host galaxies at angular separations of @xmath184 in deep optical and near - ir _ hst _ observations , and have been termed `` host - less '' .",
    "systematic studies of the host - less bursts , their afterglows , and environments was carried out by @xcite and @xcite , although individual cases were noted previously @xcite .",
    "a few examples based on deep _ hst _ near - ir observations are shown in figure  [ fig : hst ] . in all cases there is a clear absence of coincident galaxies to optical limits of @xmath185 mag and near - ir limits of @xmath186 mag @xcite .",
    "any undetected coincident host galaxies with properties similar to the known host galaxy sample ( figure  [ fig : sfr ] ) will have to reside at @xmath187 to evade detection , leading to an unexpected bimodal redshift distribution ( figure  [ fig : z ] ; @xcite ) . similarly ,",
    "if we impose a similar redshift range for any undetected hosts , then the resulting host luminosities will be @xmath188 l@xmath189 , at least an order of magnitude below the known host population ( figure  [ fig : sfr ] ) , making this explanation equally unlikely .",
    "a more likely alternative is that these bursts are associated with nearby galaxies in their field , with resulting projected offsets of tens of kpc , as expected for a subset of compact object mergers .",
    "this possibility can be assessed by analyzing the probabilities of chance coincidence for field galaxies in the _ hst _ images .",
    "the probability for a given galaxy of brightness @xmath190 to be located at a separation @xmath191 from a short grb position is given by @xcite : @xmath192 where the galaxy number counts are given by @xmath193 arcsec@xmath194 @xcite .",
    "applying this approach , @xcite and @xcite find that the host - less short grbs exhibit nearby field galaxies with low chance - coincidence probabilities of @xmath195 percent , indicating a likely association with resulting projected separations of @xmath196 .",
    "a similar analysis for short grbs with coincident host galaxies does not reveal a similar effect @xcite , demonstrating that the offset galaxies with a low probability of chance coincidence in the fields of host - less short grbs are indeed the hosts .",
    "while a definitive association will benefit from independent redshift measurements for the afterglow and galaxy , the observed excess of galaxies at moderate separations is highly indicative of a progenitor population capable of occurring at large offsets .",
    "the redshifts and properties of these likely host galaxies reveal that they are similar to the known population of short grb hosts , and the resulting projected physical offsets are tens of kpc @xcite .    while the projected physical offsets are already indicative of compact object mergers , it is important to account for the range of host galaxy sizes , and any systematic trends in these sizes between the various grb and sn populations .",
    "this can be accomplished by normalizing the projected offsets in units of host galaxy effective radii .",
    "short grb hosts tend to be larger than long grb hosts , commensurate with their larger luminosities and stellar masses @xcite .",
    "the cumulative distributions of host - normalized offsets for short grbs , long grbs , core - collapse sne , and type ia sne is shown in figure  [ fig : offset2 ] .",
    "the median host - normalized offsets for long grbs and for both type ia and core - collapse sne is @xmath197 @xcite , as expected from the definition of the half - light radius and the fact that long grb and sn progenitors do not migrate from their birth - sites .",
    "short grbs , on the other hand , have a median offset of @xmath198 , with @xmath199 of the population occurring at @xmath200 ( compared to only a few percent of stellar light ) , and only @xmath199 of the bursts located at @xmath201 . a k - s test relative to the type ia sn population yields a @xmath63-value of about @xmath202 for the null hypothesis that both populations are drawn from the same underlying distribution of host - normalized offset @xcite .",
    "thus , the offset distribution of short grbs indicates that they are located at larger distances than expected for a progenitor population that radially tracks stellar light , particularly when accounting for their host galaxy sizes .",
    "the offsets are larger than even those of type ia sne , but are in good agreement with compact object population synthesis predictions that include kicks .",
    "independent of the offset distribution , an additional test of the progenitor population is the spatial correlation ( or lack thereof ) between short grbs and the underlying light distribution of their hosts .",
    "in particular , for progenitors that track star formation activity with a short delay ( i.e. , massive stars ) we expect direct spatial correlation with the underlying rest - frame uv light ( as found for long grbs and core - collapse sne ; @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , an old progenitor population without a kick mechanism will spatially track rest - frame optical light ( as is the case for type ia sne ; @xcite ) . finally ,",
    "compact object mergers with significant kicks will result in a distribution that is only weakly correlated with the underlying rest - frame optical light .",
    "@xcite and @xcite determined the light fraction at the sub - pixel locations of 20 short grbs relative to the overall light distribution of each host galaxy ( following the methodology of @xcite ) .",
    "these measurements are available only for bursts with sub - arcsecond positions and _ hst _ follow - up , but as i discussed above , the requirement of an optical afterglow detection might only bias the resulting distribution to locations with higher ambient densities , and hence to brighter regions within the hosts .",
    "the cumulative distributions of the light fraction at short grb locations relative to the underlying rest - frame uv and optical light are shown in figure  [ fig : lightdist ] .",
    "the results are striking ; namely , about half of the short grbs are located in regions of their hosts that are fainter in both the uv and optical than any other location within these galaxies ( i.e. , they have a fractional flux value of zero ) .",
    "this essentially means that even with the superior depth of _ hst _ , no stellar light is detected at the short grb locations .",
    "this result remains true even if the short grbs at projected offsets of tens of kpc ( the host - less events ) are ignored @xcite .",
    "a k - s test relative to the null hypothesis that the progenitors track the underlying uv or optical light results in @xmath63-values of 0.01 and 0.04 , respectively @xcite .",
    "similarly , a comparison to long grbs in terms of uv light leads to @xmath203 , while a comparison to type ia sne in terms of optical light indicates @xmath204 .",
    "this indicates that short grbs occur in distinct environments from other explosive transients whose progenitors are not expected to experience kicks ( massive stars , single- or double - degenerate white dwarf systems ) , and are overall weakly correlated with the underlying distribution of star formation and even stellar mass in their hosts @xcite .",
    "given this clear discrepancy , the implication is that short grb explosion sites are not representative of the progenitor birth - sites , and therefore require significant migration ( kicks ) .",
    "this is a strong line of argument in favor of compact object mergers .      the offset distribution , and the locations of short grbs relative to the stellar light of their hosts , are indicative of systemic kicks .",
    "the required kick velocities can be inferred from a comparison of the projected physical offsets and the host galaxy stellar population ages , taking into account the host masses . while projection effects and uncertainty about the age of any specific short grb progenitor relative to the host mean stellar population age prevent the extraction of a detailed distribution , it is still possible to determine characteristic kick velocities . making the assumption @xcite that the required kick velocities are roughly the geometric mean between the minimum required velocity ( @xmath205 ) and the host velocity dispersion ( @xmath206 km s@xmath113 for late - type hosts and @xmath207 km s@xmath113 for the more massive early - type hosts ; @xcite ) , the resulting projected kick velocities span @xmath208 km s@xmath113 with a median value of about 60 km s@xmath113 @xcite .",
    "this range is consistent with the kick velocities derived for galactic ns - ns binaries based on population synthesis models , @xmath209 km s@xmath113 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the inferred distribution of kicks for short grbs is consistent with some progenitors having negligible kicks , and it does not strictly require velocities that will unbind the progenitors from their hosts .",
    "an alternative explanation for the broad offset distribution and weak correlation with stellar light is that some short grb progenitors originate in globular clusters , due to dynamically - formed compact object binaries , or to the tidal capture and collisions of compact objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "estimates of the event rate for these processes compared to primordial binaries is @xmath210 @xcite .",
    "this is roughly similar to the @xmath179 of short grbs with inferred offsets of @xmath178 kpc , but it is not sufficient to explain the weak correlation with stellar light , i.e. , @xmath211 of short grbs with fractional flux values of zero .",
    "a substantial fraction of short grbs originating in globular clusters will also lead to the prediction of a dominant population of early - type hosts since the globular cluster specific frequency is several times higher in early - type than in late - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the observed low fraction of early - type hosts in the short grb sample , which is already deficient relative to the cosmic stellar mass budget (  [ sec : hosts ] ) .",
    "in addition , formation of binaries in globular clusters generally requires core - collapsed clusters , thereby leading to a significant time delay relative to the cluster formation epoch @xcite . as a result",
    ", a dominant globular cluster population will lead to systematically lower redshifts ; for example , @xcite predict a median redshift of @xmath212 , and essentially no short grbs at @xmath213 .",
    "this result is not in strong conflict with the current redshift distribution , although the median redshift of short grbs is probably somewhat higher than @xmath214 (  [ sec : hosts ] ) .",
    "thus , while it is unlikely that most short grbs originate in globular clusters , it is possible that @xmath179 of the events originate in these environments .",
    "having explored the galactic and sub - galactic environments of short grbs , and the implications for the nature of their progenitors , i now turn to an investigation of the short grb explosion properties and their parsec - scale circumburst environments .",
    "the key parameters of interest that can be extracted from the prompt and afterglow emission are the energy scale in @xmath1-rays ( @xmath215 ) and in the blastwave powering the afterglow ( @xmath216 ) , the geometry of the outflow ( characterized by a jet half opening angle , @xmath217 ) , and the density of the ambient medium ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "the standard formulation of the afterglow synchrotron emission includes additional free parameters related to the relativistic shock microphysics : the fraction of post - shock energy in the magnetic fields ( @xmath219 ) and in the radiating relativistic electrons ( @xmath220 ) , which are assumed to follow a power law distribution , @xmath221 , above a minimum lorentz factor , @xmath222 @xcite .",
    "to determine the values of the various parameters requires multi - wavelength , multi - epoch afterglow observations spanning radio to x - rays .",
    "the synchrotron emission spectrum resulting from the interaction of the relativistic outflow with the circumburst medium is characterized by three break frequencies , corresponding to self - absorption ( @xmath223 ) , the minimum lorentz factor ( @xmath224 ) , and synchrotron cooling ( @xmath225 ) , as well as an overall flux normalization @xcite .",

    ", the time evolution of the spectrum can be used to extract @xmath217 and @xmath63 .",
    "this simple formulation has been confirmed with observations of multiple long grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although some deviations from the standard model are apparent at @xmath92 s , particularly in the x - ray band ( e.g. , initial steep decline , flares , plateaus ; @xcite ) . using the formulation of the afterglow model in @xcite i employ the following relations to determine the locations of the break frequencies ( relevant for the dominant slow - cooling regime , with @xmath228 ) : @xmath229 where @xmath230",

    "i plot the isotropic - equivalent optical luminosity in the rest - frame @xmath10-band at a fiducial rest - frame time of 7 hours ( @xmath273 ) as a function of @xmath252 . as in the case of the isotropic x - ray luminosity",
    ", there is a clear correlation between the optical luminosity and @xmath1-ray energy . for short grbs ,",
    "the best - fit power law relation is @xmath274 erg s@xmath113 , while for long grbs the relation is systematically higher , @xmath275 erg s@xmath113 .",
    "thus , in the range of @xmath252 in which the short and long grb populations overlap , the optical afterglow luminosity of short grbs is on average about 7 times fainter than for long grbs , just as in the case of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the expected trend based on the afterglow synchrotron model ( for the case of @xmath276 ) is @xmath277 . for a typical value of @xmath267",
    ", this indicates a steeper slope than inferred from the data , with @xmath278 .",
    "this trend is shown in figure  [ fig : loeg ] with a dotted line , and indeed seems to be a reasonable representation of the full range of @xmath252 spanned by short and long grbs .",
    "this is also borne out in the nearly identical cumulative distributions of the ratio @xmath279 for both short and long grbs ( figure  [ fig : loeg ] ) .",
    "however , despite the overall similarity , the short grbs have systematically lower values of this ratio in the overlap range of @xmath280 erg .",
    "a k - s test yields a @xmath63-value of about 0.016 , indicating that the two samples are not likely to be drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "thus , despite the larger scatter in the optical band compared to the x - ray band , it appears that short grbs have systematically weaker optical afterglow emission compared to long grbs , relative to both the observed correlation between @xmath281 and @xmath35 , and to the relation expected from afterglow theory .",
    "the x - ray and optical luminosities of short grb afterglows appear to be fainter relative to @xmath252 than for long grbs , by a similar factor of about 7 .",
    "this indicates that the ratio @xmath282 should have a similar distribution for both grb samples . in figure",
    "[ fig : lolx ] i plot @xmath273 versus @xmath251 for short and long grbs , and indeed find that both populations follow a similar trend , consistent with a linear correlation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the median value for both the short and long grb samples is @xmath283 , and nearly all events have @xmath284 . in the context of the synchrotron model ,",
    "the expected ratio for the case in which both the optical and x - ray bands are located below @xmath225 is @xmath285 ( for @xmath267 ) . on the other hand , for the case when @xmath225 is intermediate between the optical and x - ray bands ( e.g. , @xmath286 hz ) the expected ratio is @xmath287 , higher than most observed values .",
    "thus , the comparison of optical and x - ray luminosities suggests that generally @xmath225 is located near or above the x - ray band .",
    "since the ratio of optical to x - ray luminosity for @xmath288 and for @xmath289 is essentially the same , and since in the latter case both the x - ray and optical luminosity depend on density ( with @xmath290 ) , the lower values of @xmath291 and @xmath292 for short grbs can be interpreted as being due to a lower density scale ; this will also naturally lead to @xmath289 since @xmath293 . on the other hand ,",
    "long grbs generally have higher densities and hence @xmath288 .",
    "to match the observed weaker optical and x - ray afterglows of short grbs , requires a density scale that is about 50 times lower than for long grbs , corresponding to @xmath294 @xmath14 .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the systematic offset in the trends of @xmath273 and @xmath251 versus @xmath252 for short and long grbs is due to systematic differences between the @xmath1-ray and blastwave kinetic energies .",
    "in particular , if @xmath254 for short grbs is systematically higher than for long grbs , this would lead to values of @xmath252 that over - predict @xmath249 and hence to lower ratios of @xmath295 and @xmath296 compared to those for long grbs .",
    "given the overall shift of the best - fit relations shown in figures  [ fig : lxeg ] and [ fig : loeg ] , this scenario would require an efficiency that is about an order of magnitude larger in short grbs . with a fiducial value of @xmath297 for long grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , this requires @xmath298 for short grbs , an unlikely scenario .",
    "a possible variation of this scenario is that the blastwave kinetic energies of long grbs are systematically larger relative to @xmath299 due to significant energy injection into the forward shock following the prompt emission phase , which is absent in short grbs .",
    "indeed , the x - ray plateaus in long grbs , spanning @xmath300 s , have been interpreted as evidence for significant energy injection @xcite , but a smaller fraction of short grbs exhibit such plateaus @xcite .",
    "effectively , larger energy injection in long grbs will translate to a lower value of @xmath254 than for short grbs .",
    "an energy injection factor in long grbs of about an order of magnitude will bring the relations for short and long grbs into alignment .",
    "independent of the relative behavior of short and long grb afterglows , each optical detection or upper limit can be converted to an allowed range in the phase - space of @xmath249 and @xmath218 . for this purpose",
    "i use fixed fiducial values of the microphysical parameters , @xmath301 , @xmath302 , and @xmath267 .",
    "in addition , i restrict the range of @xmath249 for each burst to @xmath303 for a reasonable expected range of @xmath254 .",
    "the resulting distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : ekn ] .",
    "for the bulk of the short grb population , the inferred density range is @xmath304 @xmath14 , with a median for the full distribution of @xmath305 @xmath14 ; this is an upper limit due to the substantial fraction of optical non - detections .",
    "this result confirms our inference of a lower density scale compared to long grbs based on the ratios of optical and x - ray luminosity to @xmath35 .",
    "there are three bursts that may stand out from this distribution , with inferred densities of @xmath306 @xmath307 ( if @xmath308 and if their microphysical parameters are as listed above ) .",
    "two of these events ( grbs 070724a and 110112a ) have low @xmath1-ray fluences of @xmath309 erg @xmath88 , which may indicate that the /bat energy band severely underestimates the value of @xmath35 , and hence their likely @xmath249 values . with larger energies , the required densities will be lower than the values inferred above . on the other hand ,",
    "the third event ( grb050709 ) does not fall in this category .",
    "clearly , the inferred distribution of circumburst densities is affected by dispersions in the microphysical parameters and in the ratio of @xmath35 to @xmath249 , and may therefore be somewhat wider or narrower than inferred here . however , the median of the distribution is fairly robust .",
    "the relatively low density is not unexpected considering that most short grb offsets are larger than 1 @xmath175 and that nearly half of all short grbs reside in regions with no detectable stellar light (  [ sec : subgal ] ) .",
    "radio afterglow observations have been undertaken for @xmath89 short grbs , and have so far led to only 3 detections ( grbs 050724 , 051221a , and 130603b ; @xcite ) ; see table  [ tab : afterglows ] . with the exception of a few short grbs observed with the improved sensitivity of the jvla starting in 2011 , most upper limits are in the range of @xmath310 @xmath246jy ( @xmath311 ) .",
    "it is clear from a comparison to the fiducial synchrotron model listed above ( with @xmath312 @xmath246jy at @xmath313 ghz ; equation  [ eqn : ag ] ) that most of the existing limits are too shallow compared to the expected flux density scale for @xmath314 @xmath14 . on the other hand , since in the relevant regime ( @xmath315 ) the flux density scales as @xmath290 , the non - detections generally indicate @xmath316 @xmath14 .",
    "this result is supported by the three events with detected radio afterglows @xcite , and agrees with the more constraining results from the optical afterglow data .",
    "i also note that of the three bursts with potential high density based on optical observations , i find that radio observations of grb050709 instead indicate @xmath317 @xmath14 ( see also @xcite ) ; the radio limits for grbs 070724a and 110112a are not constraining beyond the information available from the optical detections .",
    "the collimation of grb outflows has direct implications for the true energy scale and event rate , as well as for our understanding of the energy extraction mechanism .",
    "the signature of collimation in grb afterglows is the so - called jet break that occurs at the time ( @xmath318 ) when the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow declines to @xmath319 @xcite .",
    "the break is due to a combination of an edge effect , when the entire emitting surface of the jet becomes visible , and sideways expansion of the outflow .",
    "together , these effects lead to a change in the evolution of the synchrotron spectrum . in particular , at frequencies above the spectral peak ( @xmath320 ) the jet break is manifested as a steepening in the decline rate from roughly @xmath321 to @xmath322 .",
    "this is relevant for the optical and x - ray bands . in the radio band , which is located below @xmath224 for typical jet break timescales , the evolution transitions from a mild rise to a shallow decline , subsequently followed by @xmath322 when @xmath224 declines below the radio band .",
    "since the jet break is due to relativistic and hydrodynamic effects , it is expected to be achromatic from radio to x - rays .",
    "the relation between the jet break time and opening angle is given by @xcite : @xmath323    in the case of long grbs , there is ample evidence for jet collimation based on the detection of jet breaks in the x - rays , optical , and/or radio on a wide range of timescales @xcite .",
    "the resulting jet opening angles are mainly in the range @xmath324 , with some events extending to about @xmath325 @xcite .",
    "the typical beaming correction factor is therefore @xmath326 \\approx 6\\times 10^{-3}$ ] .",
    "this leads to a two orders of magnitude downward correction in the energy scale , with a resulting typical value of @xmath327 erg @xcite , albeit with a spread of about an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "similarly , the upward correction to the long grb rate is @xmath328 .",
    "the information on jet breaks in short grbs is more sparse , and with the exception of grb130603b @xcite , the claimed breaks have not been detected in multiple wave - bands that can confirm the expected achromatic behavior . the key challenge for jet break detections is the faintness of short grb afterglows , which typically fade below detectable levels on a day timescale , translating to a weak constraint of @xmath329 if no break is observed @xcite .    despite this observational challenge , there are a few credible detections of jet breaks so far .",
    "grb051221a was the first short grb with evidence for collimation based on a break in its x - ray light curve at about 5 d , with the expected steepening to a power law index of @xmath330 @xcite .",
    "the inferred opening angle is @xmath331 @xcite , similar to the opening angles of long grbs . grb111020a",
    "similarly exhibited a break in its x - ray light curve , at about 2 d , leading to an inferred opening angle of @xmath332 @xcite ; the larger uncertainty compared to grb051221a is due to the unknown redshift of this burst .",
    "most recently , grb130603b exhibited a significant break in its optical light curve at about 0.45 d , accompanied by a decline in the radio band that matches the expectations of a post - jet break behavior @xcite .",
    "the inferred opening angle is @xmath333 @xcite .",
    "a potential break was also noted in the optical light curve of grb090426 at about @xmath334 d , with a steep decline typical of post jet break evolution @xcite , and an inferred opening angle of @xmath335 .",
    "in addition to these likely breaks , there are also several meaningful lower limits on jet opening angles .",
    "x - ray observations of grb050724 with /xrt and _ chandra _ revealed no break to about @xmath336 d , leading to an inferred lower limit of @xmath337 @xcite .",
    "the optical afterglow of grb050709 exhibited potential steepening at about 10 d based on a single data point @xcite , which if attributed to a jet break leads to @xmath338 ; however , this interpretation has been disputed @xcite , and here i conservatively use @xmath339 as a lower limit .",
    "x - ray observations of grb111117a with /xrt and _ chandra _ revealed no break to about @xmath340 d , leading to an inferred lower limit of @xmath341 @xcite . finally , the lack of a break in the x - ray afterglow of grb120804a to about 46 d , indicates an opening angle of @xmath342 @xcite .",
    "there are also several claimed breaks at much earlier times , @xmath343 hr , with a post - break steep decline rate that is reminiscent of jet break behavior ( grbs 061201 , 090305 , 090510 ) . if these are indeed jet breaks , then the resulting opening angles are even narrower than for most long grbs , @xmath344 .",
    "however , in the case of grb090305 the claimed break is based on a single optical data point @xcite , while for grb090510 there is no corresponding break in the optical band despite simultaneous coverage @xcite .",
    "in addition to these putative breaks , several short grbs exhibit no break in their x - ray light curves to @xmath345 , leading to typical limits of @xmath346 ( grbs 070714b , 070724a , 071227 , 081226 , 101219a ; @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of jet opening angles for short grbs , along with a comparison to long grb jets is shown in figure  [ fig : jets ] .    using the most robust detections and constraints described above ( 3 detections and 4 lower limits )",
    ", i find that the mean opening angle is @xmath347 .",
    "the resulting mean beaming factor is @xmath348 , indicating that the correction to the observed short grb rate is a factor of @xmath349 , or a rate of up to @xmath91 gpc@xmath350 yr@xmath113 @xcite . in the context of compact object mergers ,",
    "this value coincides with the middle of the range based on estimates from the galactic ns - ns binary population and from population synthesis models @xcite .",
    "when converted to the rate within the expected sensitivity volume of advanced ligo ( @xmath51 mpc ) , the resulting value is @xmath351 yr@xmath113 .",
    "i note that if claimed values of @xmath344 are indeed correct , then it is possible that the correction to the short grb rate is up to @xmath352 , leading to an advanced ligo detection rate of @xmath91 yr@xmath113 .",
    "thus , in the framework of compact object binary progenitors , the discovery rate of ns - ns binaries with advanced ligo will provide insight on short grb beaming .",
    "the inferred opening angles also determine the true energy scale of short grbs .",
    "for the 3 events with likely jet breaks , the inferred beaming - corrected @xmath1-ray energies are @xmath353 erg .",
    "the 4 events with lower limits on the opening angles lead to a similar range for their minimum beaming - corrected @xmath1-ray energies ( with the upper bounds determined by the isotropic - equivalent values ) . since the short grb sample spans @xmath354 erg ( figures  [ fig : lxeg ] and [ fig : loeg ] ) , it is likely that the beaming - corrected energies are generally @xmath355 erg ( using the typical beaming correction of @xmath356 ) .",
    "it remains to be seen , when a larger sample of opening angles becomes available , whether the true energies span a narrow range , centered on @xmath357 erg , about two orders of magnitude lower than the energy scale of long grbs .",
    "the comparison of short and long grb afterglows , and the comparison of short grb afterglow data to the standard synchrotron model , reveal several important trends .",
    "first , the ratios @xmath358 and @xmath359 are systematically lower for short grbs , by about a factor of 7 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio @xmath360 is similar for both grb samples .",
    "one implication of these results is that the afterglows of short and long grbs are overall similar in their properties , and are generated by the same mechanism , namely an external shock with the circumburst environment that amplifies magnetic fields and accelerates electrons to relativistic velocities .",
    "however , short grbs appear to explode in lower density environments . using the optical afterglows ,",
    "i find a typical density scale of @xmath361 @xmath14 .",
    "this is supported by radio afterglow limits , which indicate @xmath362 @xmath14 , and by the few events with radio to x - ray detections @xcite .",
    "the relatively low circumburst densities are consistent with the larger offsets of short grbs compared to long grbs , and with their weak spatial correlation with the underlying distribution of stellar light in their hosts .",
    "although it is less likely , the difference in the ratios of @xmath251 and @xmath273 to @xmath35 for short and long grbs may also reflect a systematic difference in the @xmath1-ray efficiency , either due to a higher radiative efficiency in the prompt emission of short grbs , or due to substantial energy injection in the early afterglow phase of long grbs .",
    "in either case , a difference by about an order of magnitude is required to reconcile the two samples .    beyond the relative trends , it is clear from figures  [ fig : lxeg ] and [ fig : loeg ] that the distribution of @xmath35 for short grbs is just as broad as for long grbs , but with systematically lower values of @xmath363 erg .",
    "the beaming - corrected energies in the several cases with likely jet opening angle measurements or meaningful lower limits are @xmath364 , about two orders of magnitude lower than for long grbs .",
    "the opening angles are generally broader than for long grbs , with a range of @xmath365 to @xmath366 and a median of @xmath347 .",
    "it is instructive to compare these inferences to the results of hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of compact object mergers as they pertain to estimates of the geometry , energy extraction mechanism , and the energy scale of relativistic outflows .",
    "several researchers carried out hydrodynamic simulations of jets launched by the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation mechanism and found jets with typical opening angles of @xmath367 , and total isotropic - equivalent energies of @xmath12 erg ( or typical beaming - corrected energies of up to @xmath368 erg ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , only @xmath179 of this energy is available to produce the prompt emission , leading a typical true energy of @xmath369 erg .",
    "this value , and the estimated upper bound on @xmath370 , are about an order of magnitude lower than observed in short grbs , although the jet opening angle estimates agree with the observed values .",
    "this suggests that for at least some short grbs , the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation mechanism is not likely to provide sufficient energy to power the observed emission .    instead , recent general relativistic mhd simulations by @xcite suggest the formation of a @xmath371 g magnetic field in both the torus ( toroidal ) and along the rotation axis ( poloidal ) following a compact object merger and the formation of a black hole .",
    "the typical opening angle of the poloidal component is @xmath372 .",
    "if an outflow is then powered by the blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite , the typical isotropic - equivalent energy scale is @xmath373 erg ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; this assumes that @xmath183 of the available energy is channeled into the relativistic outflow , and that the typical opening angle is @xmath374 based on the existing observations .",
    "thus , these simulations suggest that compact object mergers can lead to conditions that give rise to opening angles and an energy scale ( via the blandford - znajek mechanism ) that are well - matched to the observations of short grbs .",
    "one of the key predictions of the compact object merger model is the ejection of neutron - rich matter , either dynamically during the merger , or by winds from an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the typical ejecta masses and velocities inferred from merger simulations are in the range of @xmath375 m@xmath7 and @xmath376 @xcite ; the ejecta masses generally increase with larger asymmetry in the mass ratio ( i.e. , they are larger for ns - bh mergers than for ns - ns mergers ; @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting kinetic energy of the outflow is therefore in the range @xmath377 erg .",
    "the ejecta will generate radio emission through interaction with the ambient medium , with the ejecta velocity and kinetic energy , as well as the ambient density , determining the peak brightness and timescale of the radio emission ( see  [ sec : gwem ] ) .",
    "the rapid decompression of the neutron - rich matter from nuclear densities will lead to the formation of heavy radioactive elements via the @xmath10-process @xcite .",
    "the radioactive decay of these elements spans a wide range of half - lives as the elements settle on the region of @xmath378 stability , and provide a source of heating @xcite .",
    "given the low ejecta mass and rapid expansion velocity , the ejecta will become optically thin on a shorter timescale and with a lower peak luminosity than supernova explosions .",
    "this has led to the terminology of `` mini - sn '' , `` macronova '' , or `` kilonova '' to describe these counterparts @xcite ; i use the latter term here .",
    "in addition to the dynamical properties of the ejecta , the timescale , luminosity , and characteristic spectral energy distribution of a kilonova also depend on the opacity of the @xmath10-process material , since the peak of the light curve is expected when the opacity becomes sufficiently low that photons can diffuse on the expansion timescale ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the diffusion timescale is given by ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath379 where @xmath380 is a geometric factor , @xmath381 is the opacity , and @xmath382 is the radius of the expanding ejecta . in addition , the peak luminosity is given by the radioactive heating rate ( @xmath383 ) at the diffusion timescale : @xmath384 where @xmath385 is the radius of the ejecta at the diffusion timescale .",
    "finally , the characteristic blackbody temperature of the resulting emission is given by : @xmath386 for an opacity of @xmath387 @xmath388 g@xmath113 at @xmath389 @xmath246 m , typical of the fe - peak elements synthesized in sne , the resulting peak timescale is @xmath390 d , with a luminosity of @xmath391 erg s@xmath113 ( where @xmath392 is the fraction of ejecta rest - mass energy that goes into radioactive heating ; @xcite ) , and the photospheric temperature is @xmath393 k , leading to a peak in the uv / optical .",
    "however , recent investigations of the opacities due to @xmath10-process elements lead to a different conclusion . in a pioneering effort , @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that the opacities of @xmath10-process matter , particularly the lanthanides , are about two orders of magnitude higher than for fe - peak elements , with @xmath394 @xmath388 g@xmath113 at @xmath395 @xmath246 m . with these opacity values ,",
    "the expected peak timescale becomes longer by about an order of magnitude , @xmath396 days , the peak luminosity becomes correspondingly lower , @xmath397 erg s@xmath113 , and the characteristic temperatures shifts to @xmath398 k , or a peak in the near - ir .",
    "initial calculations of the @xmath10-process opacities and the resulting light curves and spectral energy distributions are provided in several recent papers @xcite .    from an observational point of view",
    ", the effect of the larger opacities is dramatic . instead of a transient that peaks in the blue part of the optical spectrum on a timescale of @xmath345 and with an absolute magnitude of about @xmath399",
    ", the kilonova is expected to peak with a similar absolute magnitude in the near - ir ( @xmath400 @xmath246 m ) on a timescale of @xmath401 . in the optical bands , on the other hand ,",
    "the peak absolute magnitude and timescale are about @xmath402 mag and @xmath345 .",
    "this has significant implications for the detectability of kilonovae in blind surveys or in optical follow - up of gravitational wave sources (  [ sec : gwem ] ) .",
    "optical searches for kilonova emission have been carried out in association with the short grbs 050509b @xcite , 070724a @xcite , 080503a @xcite , 080905a @xcite , and 100206a @xcite , but none have yielded detections .",

    "the near - ir luminosity of the likely kilonova in grb130603b provides a rough estimate of the mass of @xmath10-process ejecta produced in this event . utilizing the @xmath10-process opacity models , @xcite estimate @xmath409 m@xmath7 for ejecta velocities of @xmath410",
    "clearly , the theoretical models are preliminary , and there are variations between the calculations carried out by different groups @xcite , but the results for grb130603b suggest that at least some short grb progenitors may eject as much as @xmath411 m@xmath7 of @xmath10-process material . coupled with current estimates for the rate of ns - ns mergers , this indicates that compact object binary mergers may be the dominant site of @xmath10-process nucleosynthesis .",

    "the expected em counterparts of advanced ligo / virgo sources , and their detectability with existing and upcoming facilities , are a topic of growing interest , which has been explored in several recent papers ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to assess the importance and detectability of various em counterparts it is important to note that the advanced ligo / virgo volume - averaged distance for neutron star binary mergers is about 200 mpc , while ideally - placed and oriented binaries ( overhead relative to the detector network and with a face - on binary orientation ) can be detected to about 450 mpc @xcite .",
    "the face - on orientation may also be ideal for the detection of an on - axis short grb since the jet axis is expected to be oriented perpendicular to the plane of the binary s orbit .",
    "the typical localization region for the advanced ligo / virgo network ( 3 detectors ) is @xmath62 deg@xmath415 , although this may improve with future detectors in japan and india @xcite .",
    "the poor localization capability presents a unique challenge for em follow - up , and for counterpart discrimination and identification , compared for example to studies of short grbs from , which are localized to better than a few arcminutes radius .    despite the obvious observational challenges , the information that can be gleaned from em counterparts is invaluable @xcite .",
    "in particular , the joint detection of gravitational waves and a short grb will definitively establish the compact object merger model , and may also shed light on any differences in the short grb population that are due to mergers of ns - ns versus ns - bh binaries . even more broadly , em counterparts are essential for pinpointing the exact locations of the mergers , thereby providing an association with host galaxies , measurements of a distance scale , and a relation to specific stellar populations that will shed light on the kick and merger timescale distributions .",
    "similarly , the properties of the em counterparts will shed light on the behavior of matter following the merger , namely accretion disks , jets , and dynamical or wind - driven outflows .",
    "a summary of potential counterparts is provided in figure  [ fig : gwem ] .",
    "@xcite examined a wide range of putative on- and off - axis counterparts , and examined their potential impact for joint gw / em studies in relation to four critical virtues : ( i ) detectability with present or upcoming telescope facilities using a reasonable allocation of resources ; ( ii ) the potential to accompany a high fraction of gw detections ; ( iii ) distinguishability from other astrophysical transients that may contaminate the large search areas ; and ( iv ) allowing for a localization to arcsecond precision .",
    "other studies of em counterparts have also explored the issue of detectability and background contamination , generally reaching similar conclusions , although some studies employ different criteria for `` detectability '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "at least some advanced ligo / virgo sources are expected to be accompanied by on - axis short grbs with detectable @xmath1-ray emission and a bright multi - wavelength afterglow .",
    "since existing @xmath1-ray satellites and large ground - based telescopes are capable of detecting short grbs and their afterglows to @xmath108 , such an event at @xmath416 mpc ( @xmath417 ) will be exceedingly bright .",
    "in particular , using the measured x - ray and optical luminosities of even the least energetic short grbs ( with @xmath418 erg ; figures  [ fig : lxeg ] and [ fig : loeg ] ) , i predict an x - ray flux at @xmath419 d of @xmath420 erg s@xmath113 @xmath88 and an optical brightness of @xmath421 mag .",
    "these are detectable levels assuming that the @xmath1-ray emission can be pinpointed to an area typical of /bat localizations . for a short grb with a median energy scale ,",
    "the expected x - ray flux is @xmath422 erg s@xmath113 @xmath88 and the optical brightness is @xmath423 mag . such a bright optical counterpart may be detectable even if the @xmath1-ray position is as poor as the gw localization , for example typical of _ fermi_/gbm positions .",
    "however , such a large area can not be effectively searched with /xrt , which has a small field - of - view of only 0.25 deg@xmath415 .",
    "the temporally coincident detection of a short grb and a gw source will serve as the clearest smoking gun for the compact object merger model .",
    "it may also help to improve the positional accuracy of the gw source ( if detected by an instrument such as /bat ) , but even a poor @xmath1-ray localization will provide a convincing association based on the temporal coincidence . however , since the current estimate of the beaming fraction is @xmath424 (  [ sec : jets ] ) , such joint detections will be rare",
    ". the occurrence rate can be estimated using the observed short grb redshift distribution @xcite .",
    "in particular , there are currently no known short grbs within the advanced ligo / virgo maximum detection distance for ns - ns binaries of @xmath425 . extrapolating the observed redshift distribution to @xmath417 , and correcting from the /bat field - of - view to roughly all - sky coverage ( e.g. , ipn , _",
    "fermi_/gbm ) the expected coincidence rate is @xmath149 yr@xmath113 @xcite .",
    "thus , while joint gw and short grb detections will play a critical role in establishing the identity of the progenitors , and will provide particularly bright counterparts , such detections are expected to be rare .    another profitable approach in the context of joint @xmath1-ray and gw detections is to carry out a systematic search for gw emission in temporal coincidence with short grbs @xcite .",
    "the key advantage is that a search around a narrow time window , and with a position reconstruction that is consistent with the short grb location , will allow for a reduced significance threshold .",
    "such a search was carried out during ligo science run 6 and virgo science runs 2 and 3 @xcite , but unsurprisingly it did not yield any detections since the short grb sample extends much beyond the reach of these initial detectors ( figure  [ fig : z ] ) . on the other hand , the improved sensitivity of advanced ligo / virgo may reach the nearest short grbs .",
    "a coincident optical afterglow is more likely to be detected than a @xmath1-ray counterpart since even with an initial off - axis viewing angle the jet will eventually decelerate and spread into the observer s line of sight .",
    "however , larger off - axis viewing angles result in reduced peak brightness , due to the longer timescale for the jet to spread into the line of sight . using the existing sample of short grb optical",
    "afterglows it is possible to predict their appearance for off - axis observers .",
    "@xcite utilized the off - axis afterglow models of @xcite with the parameters appropriate for on - axis short grb afterglows (  [ sec : afterglow ] ) and found that for an off - axis angle that is twice the jet opening angle ( @xmath426 ) the peak brightness of the afterglows at a typical distance of 200 mpc is expected to be @xmath427 mag with a peak time of @xmath13 d , barely within the reach of the largest wide - field optical telescopes . at even larger off - axis",
    "angles the optical afterglow is essentially undetectable ( @xmath428 mag for @xmath429 ) .",
    "the fraction of gw events that will be oriented within an angle of @xmath430 is @xmath431 @xcite , where the pre - factor of 6.8 takes into account the nearly face - on orientation of the binary , which leads to a larger detection volume than for random orientations .",
    "thus , a few gw sources per year may be accompanied by off - axis optical afterglow emission with a peak brightness of @xmath427 mag and a peak timescale of @xmath13 days .",
    "finding such counterparts will require deep and rapid searches with wide - field optical telescopes , but this is within the reach of existing and upcoming facilities .",
    "the underlying reason for the faintness of optical afterglows at large off - axis viewing angles is that by the time the jet spreads into the observer s line of sight ( weeks to months to years after the event ) the outflow becomes only mildly relativistic and the peak of the synchrotron spectrum is shifted to the radio ghz band . in principle",
    ", this means that radio afterglow emission can serve as an ideal counterpart for all gw sources due to its detectability from any off - axis angle @xcite . in reality , the detectability of such radio emission depends on the kinetic energy of the blastwave and the ambient density .",
    "in addition to the initially collimated and relativistic outflow , radio emission will also be produced by any non - relativistic isotropic outflow as it interacts with the ambient medium and decelerates @xcite . in the latter scenario",
    "the initial velocity of the outflow is another critical parameter that determines the detectability of the radio emission .",
    "such outflows are expected in compact object mergers from tidally unbound debris or from accretion disk winds @xcite .    for the case of an initially collimated and relativistic outflow",
    "it is again useful to consider the observed properties of short grb afterglows to investigate the expected brightness and detectability of an off - axis radio afterglow .",
    "the timescale for the blastwave to decelerate , isotropize , and reach peak brightness is @xmath432 , where @xmath433 is the kinetic energy in units of @xmath434 erg and @xmath435 is the blastwave velocity in units of the speed of light ; for an initially collimated and relativistic jet @xmath436 @xcite .",
    "thus , for the typical energy and density scales inferred for short grbs ( @xmath437 and @xmath294 @xmath14 ;  [ sec : afterglow ] ) , the resulting peak time is @xmath438 d. the expected peak brightness ( occurring at @xmath439 ) is @xmath440 @xcite , where i have scaled to a distance of 200 mpc and to the fiducial values of @xmath301 and @xmath302 used in ",
    "[ sec : afterglow ] to infer the short grb afterglow properties .",
    "for the typical energy and density of short grbs , this leads to @xmath441 mjy .    for dynamical or wind - driven ejecta",
    "the typical mass scale is @xmath442 m@xmath7 with a velocity of @xmath443 , corresponding to @xmath444 @xcite .",
    "since the density of @xmath8 @xmath14 inferred from short grb observations is still relevant for this case , this indicates @xmath445 years and @xmath446 mjy . for the most extreme outflow parameters indicated by numerical simulations ( @xmath8 m@xmath7 and @xmath447 ) ,",
    "the peak brightness is @xmath448 mjy , but it will only occur on a timescale of @xmath449 years .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath450 represents not only the timescale to reach peak brightness , but also the typical timescale for the source to display significant brightness variability . from the point of view of a counterpart search , a source that does not vary significantly on a decade timescale , about a decade following",
    "a gw trigger is unlikely to be identified as an associated transient with any level of confidence .    the key question ,",
    "therefore , is whether a radio transient with a typical peak brightness of @xmath451 mjy and a peak / variability timescale of @xmath452 can be detected and identified in a @xmath62 deg@xmath415 region with existing and upcoming facilities . to assess this question ,",
    "i note that for the jvla , with a 0.45 deg@xmath415 field - of - view at 1 ghz , full coverage of such an area requires at least 200 individual pointings . with a synthesized beam of about @xmath453",
    "diameter , there are about @xmath454 independent beams within this region , indicating that the minimum required significance level for a detection is @xmath455 ( making the unrealistically optimistic assumption that the noise in a 100 deg@xmath415 region is purely gaussian , with no systematic effects ) .",
    "to detect such a source as a transient requires at least a factor of two change in brightness , which means that the observations need to reach a typical @xmath456 noise level of @xmath457 @xmath246jy . with the jvla this requires a few hours of integration per pointing , or about a month of continuous observing per epoch",
    "this unrealistic follow - up scenario is further exacerbated by the fact that at 1 ghz source confusion leads to a sensitivity floor of @xmath451 mjy ( depending on the jvla configuration ) , which is comparable to the level of the expected signal .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that radio emission will be detectable with jvla follow - up of a typical advanced ligo / virgo error region .",
    "the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap ) wide - field interferometer is expected to image @xmath458 deg@xmath415 in only a few pointings , and is therefore better matched to typical gw error regions .",
    "however , askap s limited angular resolution of about @xmath459 will lead to source confusion at the level of the anticipated signal , @xmath460 mjy @xcite",
    ". finally , lower frequency instruments such as the low - frequency array ( lofar ) and the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) have sufficiently wide fields to instantaneously cover a full gw error region , but they are even more severely hampered by source confusion due to their lower angular resolution and the increased background at lower radio frequencies ( @xmath170 ghz ) .",
    "moreover , at the these frequencies the typical timescale for the outflow to reach peak brightness will be years to decades , instead of months at ghz frequencies .",
    "i therefore conclude that while radio counterparts are in principle detectable from all viewing angles , existing facilities are not well - matched to the faintness of the anticipated signals .",
    "it is possible that in the long term multi - detector gw networks will localize some events to @xmath461 deg@xmath415 @xcite , making radio searches more feasible .",
    "in addition , since the radio signal is delayed compared to counterparts at other wave - bands , a more profitable approach may be to use radio observations to follow up candidate counterparts from @xmath1-ray , x - ray , or optical / near - ir searches , potentially as a way of distinguishing a true counterpart from unrelated sources ( e.g. , supernovae , agn ) .",
    "as i discussed in  [ sec : kilonova ] , ns - ns and ns - bh mergers are also expected to be accompanied by isotropic optical / near - ir emission produced by the radioactive decay of @xmath10-process elements in a dynamical or accretion disk wind driven outflow @xcite . to date",
    ", the primary insight on the expected properties of such counterparts comes from numerical simulations coupled with @xmath10-process opacity calculations @xcite , and from the near - ir counterpart associated with the short grb130603b (  [ sec : kilonova ] ; @xcite ) . in this context",

    "for example ,",
    "eso s visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) has an instantaneous field - of - view of about 0.6 deg@xmath415 , requiring about 170 pointings to cover a typical gw error region .",
    "this limits the exposure time per pointing to @xmath62 s for a single - night visit .",
    "the @xmath469 point - source sensitivity in such an exposure time is @xmath470 ab mag , about a magnitude too shallow even for a bright kilonova .",
    "a better chance to detect the near - ir emission from a kilonova counterpart may be presented by a future space - based observatory , for example wfirst .",
    "the current design reference document @xcite indicates an instantaneous field - of - view of about 0.3 deg@xmath415 , requiring several hundred pointings to cover a typical gw error region .",
    "however , the point - source sensitivity in a 1 min exposure is expected to be @xmath471 ab mag ( @xmath469 ) , allowing for the detection of a wide range of kilonovae .",
    "a more profitable approach , especially prior to the launch of a facility such as wfirst , is to use wide - field optical telescopes in the reddest bands accessible to ccd detectors ( @xmath465 ) . in this context",
    ", there are several existing and upcoming facilities capable of mounting sensitive follow - up campaigns ( pan - starrs , blanco / decam , subaru / hsc , lsst ) . to detect the faint and fast kilonova signal with sufficient significance requires at least nightly coverage of the full gw error region . for example",
    ", pan - starrs has a field - of - view of 7 deg@xmath415 and can therefore cover a typical error region with about 15 min per pointing , achieving a @xmath469 point source sensitivity of @xmath472 ab mag .",
    "similarly , with the decam field - of - view of 3 deg@xmath415 a typical gw error region can be covered to a depth of @xmath473 ab mag ( @xmath469 ) in a single night .",
    "a similar depth can be reached with subaru / hsc which has a larger aperture , but a smaller field of view .",
    "finally , lsst will be able to provide rapid and efficient coverage to @xmath473 ab mag ( @xmath469 ) in @xmath474 hr , or alternatively to @xmath475 ab mag in a single night .",
    "these sensitivities are sufficient to detect kilonovae over a broad range of expected ejecta masses , provided that a systematic campaign lasting several days is undertaken . equally important , non - detections with such searches will yield meaningful upper bounds on the ejecta properties .    unlike in @xmath1-rays , and to some extent even in the radio band , optical searches with the required area and depth to robustly detect a kilonova will undoubtedly yield a wide range of unrelated variable and transient sources . to robustly identify or rule out",
    "a kilonova will therefore require the ability to reject background and foreground contaminants .",
    "one possibility is to restrict the search area to regions around galaxies within the expected advanced ligo / virgo range of 200 mpc @xcite . to achieve this goal requires all - sky spectroscopic information for galaxies down to at least @xmath476 l@xmath189 , which represent the hosts of short grbs ( figure  [ fig : sfr ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "such spectroscopic information can be obtained from a narrow - band h@xmath477 imaging survey , or using an hi emission line radio survey .",
    "the potential of such surveys was investigated by @xcite using information from existing galaxy surveys , as well as guidance from the distribution of short grb host galaxy properties ( e.g. , stellar masses , star formation rates ) .",
    "the basic finding is that realistic h@xmath477 and hi surveys can uncover about @xmath478 of the star formation within 200 mpc , but only @xmath479 of the stellar mass .",
    "the high incompleteness for stellar mass is due to the fact that about half of the stellar mass in the local universe is contained in elliptical galaxies which produce weak or no h@xmath477 emission and contain little neutral hydrogen gas .",
    "the level of completeness with respect to the population of short grb hosts is about 50% for both methods",
    "thus , using galaxy catalogs to reduce the search area to locations around galaxies within 200 mpc may result in a factor of @xmath480 loss in the counterpart identification rate . on the other hand",
    ", this approach may reduce the background and foreground contamination dramatically @xcite . for ns - bh mergers , which can be detected to much larger distances ,",
    "this method is likely to be inefficient .",
    "the mitigation of contaminating sources may also benefit from color information . in the existing kilonova models ,",
    "the spectral energy distribution is unusually red compared to most known transients .",
    "therefore , the combined use of @xmath481 band photometry could substantially reduce the contamination from agn flares , supernovae , supernova shock breakouts , or galactic stellar flares which generally peak in the optical / uv @xcite . finally , the shorter duration of kilonova events , though still @xmath468 days , can help to distinguish these sources from foreground stellar flares ( generally @xmath482 durations ) and background supernovae ( generally @xmath483 durations ) .",
    "clearly , the challenge of background / foreground rejection should be investigated using observations that match the anticipated signal in depth , timescale , and color .",
    "these parameters are not currently covered by on - going time - domain surveys such as pan - starrs , ptf , or des .",
    "in addition to potential em counterparts that are motivated by existing short grb observations , other speculative counterparts have been theorized in recent years .",
    "the validity of these theoretical models , and the nature of any resulting em radiation are difficult to assess without observational evidence , while the proposed energy scale for some counterparts is likely too low to be detectable with existing facilities .",
    "@xcite argue that compact object mergers lead to the amplification of @xmath484 g magnetic fields on the merger timescale , and speculate that if even @xmath485 of the available energy is channeled into @xmath1-rays , the resulting isotropic signal will be detectable with /bat .",

    "the host galaxy population have led to several key findings that i summarized and explored in this review :    * short grbs span a wide range of redshifts , at least @xmath489 .",

    "nearly all of these limits are for short grbs in star - forming galaxies , indicating that such environments are not indicative of an association with massive stars . *",
    "short grbs occur in both early- and late - type galaxies , with the former accounting for about @xmath199 of the sample .",
    "the sub - dominant fraction of early - type hosts indicates that the short grb rate is influenced by both stellar mass and star formation activity .",

    "the distribution of host galaxy stellar masses follows the expectation from the field galaxy mass function for early - type hosts , but is lower than expected for late - type hosts .",
    "this indicates that star formation activity results in an elevated short grb rate per unit stellar mass .",
    "combined with the broad distribution of host galaxy stellar population ages , the inferred delay time distribution roughly follows @xmath130 . * the host galaxies of short grbs follow the general properties and trends of the field galaxy population ( in terms of stellar masses , star formation rates , specific star formation rates , metallicities ) , but have systematically higher luminosities , larger stellar masses , older stellar population ages , higher metallicities , and lower star formation rates and specific star formation rates than the hosts of long grbs . *",

    "the afterglows of short grbs are systematically less luminous than those of long grbs .",

    "a dominant channel of delayed magnetars , formed through white dwarf accretion - induced collapse or white dwarf binary mergers , can explain the host demographics , but does not naturally lead to the observed offset distribution or to the weak spatial correlation with optical light .",
    "finally , models in which short grbs are produced by massive stars in a similar fashion to long grbs are ruled out by the lack of sn associations , the occurrence of short grbs in early - type galaxies , the clear differences in the host galaxy population , the lack of spatial association with uv light , and the large differences in energy and circumburst density scales .",
    "it is indeed quite remarkable that the underlying theoretical motivations that led to the compact object binary merger model prior to the identification of short grbs as a distinct class ( e.g. , @xcite ) have been borne out by the extensive observational effort over the past decade .    at the same time , there are clear challenges for the compact object binary merger model , which may require a more careful assessment of the physical conditions during the merger , or perhaps a minor contribution from a distinct progenitor channel . for example , the @xmath62-sec extended emission observed in about 15% of short grbs does not naturally fit in the basic merger framework , although several theoretical explanations exist for this emission component @xcite .",
    "similarly , there are potential clues in the commonalities and differences between the prompt emission properties of long and short grbs ( with and without extended emission ) that may shed light on the nature of the progenitors and/or the engine .",

    "the existing sample already provides deep insight into the nature of the progenitors and the explosion properties , but larger samples , combined with individual high - quality events ( e.g. , grb130603b ) are essential for addressing some of the open questions listed above . an operational @xmath1-ray satellite ( preferably with all - sky coverage ) in the advanced ligo / virgo era is also critical for establishing a direct connection between compact object mergers and short grbs .",
