    "elliptical galaxies lack the dynamical simplicity of spiral galaxies , posing well - known challenges for determining their intrinsic properties ( _ e.g. _ , mass distribution , shape , orbit structure ) . the projected stellar velocity dispersion radial profile , @xmath2 , is easily measured , but is subject to a degeneracy between the mass distribution and the orbital anisotropy , where radial variations in the stellar orbit types mask or mimic changes in the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath3 ) ( binney & mamon 1982 ; tonry 1983 ) .",
    "crucial for resolving this degeneracy is the measurement of higher - order moments of the stellar line - of - sight velocity distributions ( losvds ) .",
    "such losvd information has been used to constrain the masses of central supermassive black holes ( van der marel _",

    "other techniques are necessary to probe this outer mass distribution .    in nearby galaxies , the two main candidates for such probes are x - ray emission from extended hot gas ( see fabbiano 1989  4.4 for a review ) , and the discrete velocities of either planetary nebulae ( _ e.g. _ , ciardullo , jacoby , & dejonghe 1993 ; tremblay , merritt , & williams 1995 ; hui _ et al .",

    "however , the analysis of discrete kinematical measurements calls for more refined dynamical models than either simple virial estimators ( _ e.g. _ , heisler , tremaine , & bahcall 1985 ; kent 1990 ; haller & melia 1996 ) or binning the data and using the jeans equations ( _ e.g. _ , federici _ et al .",

    "these procedures do not guarantee a physical solution , make unwarranted assumptions about the orbital anisotropy , and do not make full use of the constraints provided by the data .",
    "the first two deficiencies are alleviated by techniques employing distribution function ( df ) basis sets that permit the full freedom of orbit types ( _ e.g. _ , merritt , meylan , & mayor 1997 ; mathieu & dejonghe 1999 ; saglia _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) . but these techniques typically bin the data in radius and velocity , destroying potentially useful information , such as the maximum observed velocity as a direct constraint on the escape velocity .",
    "more general methods are needed to make better use of the information contained in the discrete velocity data ; merritt & saha ( 1993 ) and merritt ( 1993 ) have demonstrated one such approach using df basis sets and maximum likelihood methods .",
    "we develop a general dynamical method based on orbit modeling , and apply it to a real galaxy , m87 .",
    "the giant central virgo cluster galaxy m87 (= ngc 4486 ) , although not a typical elliptical , is nevertheless a prime candidate for modeling because of the abundance of data available on it .",
    "in addition to high - precision measurements of its higher - order stellar velocity moments and of the radially - extended velocity dispersion , it has the largest available sample of globular cluster ( gc ) velocity measurements .",
    "the stellar velocity measurements extend out to @xmath6 , and the gc measurements to @xmath7 , probing well into the area where the dynamics are presumably dominated by the dark halo of the galaxy or of the virgo cluster .",
    "the combination of these kinematical constraints should provide robust limits on the dark matter distribution , and on the orbital structures of both the stars and the gcs .    while a variety of modeling techniques have been used to study the stellar dynamics of m87 ( sargent _ et al . _",

    "the stellar dynamics of its _ halo _ have not been modeled in detail , nor have the higher - order velocity moments been used as strict constraints . but",
    "the best available tracers of the halo mass distribution are ultimately the gcs and the hot gas , which can be easily observed at large radii .",
    "some simple dynamical methods have been used to estimate the halo mass using the gcs ( merritt & tremblay 1993 ; cr ) .",
    "they claim that the radially - rising velocity dispersion profile rules out a constant @xmath3 model , and that it suggests that the gcs are in fact tracing the virgo cluster potential rather than m87 s own potential ( as suggested also by analyses of the x - ray emission and the kinematics of the cluster galaxies ; _ e.g. _ , see nulsen & bhringer 1995 ; mclaughlin 1999 ) . but a more rigorous dynamical model , allowing for the systematic orbital uncertainties , is necessary to confirm these findings",

    "the final velocity dispersion profile is nearly constant for @xmath42 , outside of which it falls off slowly with radius ( @xmath43 ) . comparing @xmath44 and @xmath45 from positive and negative radii , we find differences larger than are consistent with the stated uncertainties .",

    "there is a paucity of low velocity measurements at large radii , which may be related to the rotation of the gcs along the galaxy s major axis in the outer parts , as demonstrated by kissler - patig & gebhardt ( 1998 ) . for the gcs with @xmath68 , there were only 4 measurements taken on the `` approaching '' side and 23 on the `` receding '' side .",
    "thus , the large - radius velocity asymmetry is probably due to incomplete spatial coverage , which may make our mean velocity for the system systematically high ( it is decreased from 1352 to 1293 km s@xmath41 if the clusters with @xmath69 are omitted ) .",

    "for both the stellar models and the gc models , we use 2500 particle orbits .",
    "for the stars , @xmath88 spans the range @xmath94@xmath95 , resulting in a radial coverage of @xmath96@xmath97 ( sis model ) or @xmath96@xmath98 ( constant @xmath3 model ) . for the gcs , @xmath99100@xmath100 , corresponding to @xmath96@xmath101 ( sis model ) or @xmath96@xmath102 ( constant @xmath3 model ) .",
    "we next compute the orbit projection `` kernels '' , which correspond to the contribution of each orbit to each observable .",
    "the predictions of the model can then be expressed as follows : @xmath103 where the @xmath104 are the orbit weights , and the kernels @xmath105 have been averaged over time and over all spherical - polar viewing angles @xmath106 .",
    "for example , the kernel for the angle - averaged surface density in an annulus between @xmath107 and @xmath108 of an orbit at an instantaneous radius @xmath109 is given by the integral @xmath110 where the orbit s instantaneous density is @xmath111 , the variable @xmath112 represents the line of sight s position in the tangential plane @xmath106 , and the integration is carried out along the line of sight @xmath113 .",
    "the viewing - angle integral ( along @xmath114 ) is nontrivial for kernels that involve velocity measurements .",
    "placed at the initial radius @xmath88 , the orbit is run forward in time for one radial period @xmath115 , and the final kernel is found by averaging over time : @xmath116 where the integration is handled by a bulirsch - stoer type integrator .",

    "both our nfw models and the x - ray model have density profiles that decline more gradually than isothermal in the galaxy s outer parts ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath212 at @xmath213 15 kpc ) , giving a circular velocity curve @xmath214 that continues rising at large radii ( fig .",
    "most elliptical galaxies have a constant or declining @xmath214 at these radii ( gerhard _ et al .",

    "a caveat about these new models is that the mass normalization from the stellar and gc data separately is again inconsistent ( at the 12  @xmath171 level ) .",
    "this may indicate that a still more accurate mass model @xmath199 could be found to fit all the existing constraints ( possibly one with a larger , less - concentrated cluster halo as in mclaughlin 1995 ) , and/or that one or both of the dynamical subsystems ( stars and gcs ) would be better modeled without the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "further exploration of more detailed models would be useful , but outside the scope of this project .",
    "we have not implemented any method of rigorously exploring the range of df functional forms permitted by the data , so the following results are meant to be suggestive rather than conclusive .",

    "the downwards dive in @xmath218 near @xmath219 is due to the sharp turnover in @xmath2 inside that radius .",

    "_ 1997 ) , and thus has not been accurately treated by our models . in summary , our best models indicate mild radial orbit anisotropy ( @xmath223 0.20.5 ) for the well - constrained stellar region of the galaxy ( @xmath224@xmath225 0.12 kpc )  a characteristic which has turned out to be quite typical for bright elliptical galaxies ( see gerhard _",
    "_ 2001 and references therein ) .",

    "the vertical dashed lines indicate the radial regions constrained by the stellar kinematical data .",
    "0.55 cm    fig .",
    "12 shows the orbital characteristics of the globular cluster system for the overall best - fit solutions .",
    "there is considerable variation between the best nfw solutions , so we can not yet strongly constrain the gc anisotropy , except to note that it seems roughly isotropic at large radii ( @xmath204@xmath226 1040 kpc ) .",
    "this seems to contradict the tangential anisotropy one would expect given the flat and double - peaked losvds seen in the data and in the models that fit only the gc data ( see  2.4 and figs . 7 and 8) ;  illustrating further the need for a mass model that better fits both the stellar and gc constraints .",

    "we have developed a very general spherical orbit modeling method that makes full use of all the information in a set of discrete velocity data , and have applied it to the giant elliptical galaxy m87 using all the available dynamical constraints ( measurements of the spatial distribution and the kinematics of the stars and of the globular clusters ) . by comparing two simple mass models  a constant mass - to - light ratio galaxy and a singular isothermal sphere  we find that a constant @xmath3 is ruled out to a high level of significance .",
    "we further implement some more generalized mass models in order to more accurately represent the galaxy as consisting of a constant @xmath3 stellar system plus a dark halo .",
    "we find improved solutions which have a dark halo density profile decreasing more slowly than @xmath228 at large radii ( 1040 kpc ) .",
    "this very extended halo seems best interpreted as belonging to the virgo cluster itself , rather than to m87 .",
    "there is substantial room for improvement of our m87 models .",
    "first , measurements of higher - order velocity moments for the stars are available to only @xmath229",
    ". such measurements at larger radii would be quite helpful in better constraining the models , and can be most efficiently obtained by measuring discrete velocities of the galaxy s planetary nebulae .",
    "second , a larger range of mass models could be explored to find solutions that fit the stellar and gc data together more consistently . and",
    "third , future models could relax our assumption of spherical symmetry , providing a more accurate model of the system in its outer parts , where flattening is seen in both the stellar and gc systems .",
    "the same techniques should also be applied to other , non - cd giant elliptical galaxies in clusters ( such as ngc 4472 ) , as well as to galaxies in the field .",
    "the different formational histories of these galaxies ( via mergers , accretion , etc . ) may result in significantly different mass distributions and dynamics .",
    "furthermore , the colors , abundances , and spatial distributions of the gcs in m87 and other galaxies indicate that they comprise two or more distinct populations ( _ e.g. _ , neilsen & tsvetanov 1999 ; gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 )",
    ". it would be interesting to use our orbit modeling methods to look for any dynamical differences between these populations , which may shed light on their formation histories , for which several different scenarios have been proposed ( _ e.g. _ , ashman & zepf 1992 ; forbes , brodie , & grillmair 1997 ; harris , harris , & mclaughlin 1998 ; ct , marzke , & west 1998 ) .",
