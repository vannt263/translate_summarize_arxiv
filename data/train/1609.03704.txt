    "in this paper we consider two classical geometric control problems  @xcite : the problem of euler s elasticae and the problem of sub - riemannian ( sr ) geodesics on @xmath0 .",
    "solution curves to both problems have many applications in mechanics  @xcite , robotics  @xcite , image processing  @xcite and modelling of human visual system  @xcite .",
    "although solutions are well known in geometric control community , the authors have noticed a common confusion in applied societies where people sometimes mix these two curves .",
    "the reason is that the formulation of the problems is very similar , and at first sight one can wrongly deduce that euler s elasticae are obtained via reparametrization of sr - geodesics by arclength . to prevent this possible confusion we clarify that these two curves coincide only in the case of straight line .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following .",
    "first we briefly expose the history of the problems in introduction .",
    "afterwards , in section  [ sec : statement ] , we formulate both problems as optimal control problems on the lie group @xmath0 and discuss two natural parameterizations for the solution curves . in section  [ sec : pmp ] we apply pontryagin maximum principle for both problems and prove the main result in theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : comparison ] , we present several simulations with comparison of elasticae and sr - geodesics , which support our theoretical result .      in 1744",
    "leonhard euler considered the problem on stationary configurations of an elastic rod with fixed endpoints and tangents at the endpoints  @xcite .",
    "euler obtained differential equations for stationary configurations of the rod and described their possible qualitative types .",
    "these configurations are called euler s elasticae .",
    "euler s elasticae are critical points of the elastic energy functional .",
    "the question as to which of the critical points are minima ( local or global ) was answered in  @xcite .",
    "afterwards the software to the boundary value problem ( bvp ) was proposed in  @xcite , and thus a numerical realization of the optimal synthesis was obtained .",
    "the sub - riemannian problem on @xmath0 is formulated as follows . by",
    "given two unit vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 attached respectively at two given points @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the plane , to find an optimal motion in the plane that transfers @xmath5 to @xmath6 such that the vector @xmath7 is transferred to the vector @xmath8 .",
    "the vector can move forward or backward and rotate simultaneously .",
    "the required motion should be optimal in the sense of minimal length in the space @xmath9 , so called sr - length , where @xmath10 is the slope of the moving vector .",
    "the problem can be seen as an optimal motion planning problem for the reeds - shepp car , which can move forward and backward and rotate on a place  @xcite .",
    "it has important relations to vision  @xcite and image processing  @xcite .",
    "sr - geodesics are critical points of the sr - length functional .",
    "explicit parametrization of the geodesics by jacobi elliptic functions and elliptic integrals was obtained in  @xcite .",
    "a study of optimality of the geodesics was done in  @xcite , where the optimal synthesis was obtained . here and below in the text by ",
    "geodesic  we mean a sub - riemannian geodesic on @xmath0 .",
    "both curves ( elasticae and geodesics ) are determined by optimal control problems on the lie group @xmath0 , the group of euclidean motions of a plane .",
    "the group @xmath0 is represented by @xmath11 matrices  @xcite @xmath12 the group can be naturally identified with the coupled space of positions and orientations @xmath13 by identifying @xmath14 .",
    "then for each @xmath15 one has the left multiplication @xmath16 via the push - forward @xmath17 of the left - multiplication one gets the left - invariant frame @xmath18 from the lie - algebra basis @xmath19 at the unity @xmath20 : @xmath21 for a curve @xmath22 on @xmath0 its projection @xmath23 on @xmath24 is called the _ spatial projection_. in this note we consider only so - called horizontal curves , that satisfy the horizontality condition @xmath25 .",
    "there exist two natural parameterizations of horizontal curves on @xmath0 suitable for different needs ( see  @xcite ) :    * sub - riemannian ( sr ) arclength parameter @xmath26 is defined by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 for a given constant @xmath29 . here and",
    "further in the text by dot we denote the derivative @xmath30 . *",
    "spatial arclength parameter @xmath31 is defined by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 . here and further in the text",
    "we denote by prime the derivative @xmath34 .",
    "the spatial projection @xmath35 of a horizontal curve @xmath36 can have singularities  cusp points , which appear when the velocity vector @xmath37 has nonzero component only in @xmath10 direction .",
