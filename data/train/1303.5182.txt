    "the spontaneous emission spectrum of a two - level atom in the absence of any driving field exhibits a lorentzian line shape whose width according to the weisskopf - wigner theory is proportional to einstein s decay rate , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum modifies in the presence of a driving field .",
    "a two - level atom leads to a three - peak resonance fluorescence spectrum when it decays from an upper level to a lower one @xcite .",
    "however , a three - level atom , when the driving field couples the upper two levels and decay takes place from an intermediate level to the ground , exhibits an autler - townes doublet in the spectrum @xcite . these modifications in the spectrum arise due to stark splitting of the driven atomic energy levels where the decaying atom from the two dressed states interfere destructively to create a fano type dark line in the single lorentzian peak @xcite . a large number of studies exist to understand different aspects of spontaneous emission of this type of atom - field interaction .",
    "for example in ref .",
    "agarwal if the upper two levels are degenerate then the spectrum can be modified because of the mechanisms of population trapping and the quantum interference while in ref .",
    "@xcite if the upper two levels are closely placed comparable to @xmath0 then the single dark line always exists even in the absence of the driving field",
    ". however this condition was avoided by zhu _",
    "@xcite as the interference mechanism is always there even in the presence of the field at any strength .",
    "the autler - townes doublet and its spontaneous emission version are based on the simple probability loss .",
    "however , the spectroscopy both in absorption and emission context is studied extensively in the context of naturally existing complications .",
    "furthermore , paspalakis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite utilized this scheme for spontaneous emission from a coherently prepared and microwave - driven doublet of potentially closely excited states to a common ground .",
    "they showed that the effect of the relative phase between the pump and the coupling field allows us to control efficiently the spontaneous emission spectrum and the population dynamics .",
    "following the work of toschek and coworkers physik , keil , keil00 there have been a number of studies of autler - townes splitting in probe absorption , when a strong laser pump field drives a coupled transition in a vapor cell or atomic beam pic , ph , bjor , gray , delsart , fisk .",
    "the autler - townes doublet scheme has been utilized to study other areas of quantum optics .",
    "these include , for example , the direct measurement of the state of electromagnetic fields autler - zubairy , reconstruction of the wigner function of non - classical fields such as a schdinger - cat state @xcite , the measurement of the wigner function for a generalized entangled state @xcite and the measurements of atomic position in a standing wave field @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of the autler - townes doublet can further be generalized to a triplet when a four - level atom interacts appropriately with three coherent fields @xcite .",
    "the interaction splits the upper excited bare energy state into a triplet .",
    "the atom now finds itself in three decaying dressed states resulting in the quantum interference effect .",
    "two dark lines appear which split the single lorentzian peak into the three components ( bright lines ) .",
    "these results achieved were analytical for a simplified version of the atom - field system @xcite and were numerical for an experimental feasible scheme @xcite .",
    "further , this scheme has been utilized for precision measurement of atomic position in the standing wave - field from the emission @xcite and absorption spectrum sehrai .",
    "furthermore , the efficient control of the widths of the three spectral components can be used for the measurement of the state of the radiation field under relaxed experimental condition as compared to the one reported in ref .",
    "this type of atom - field interaction also leads to subluminal and superluminal behavior of the probe absorbed field under the condition of eit @xcite .    owing to the potential use of the autler - townes doublet and triplet spectroscopy in the spontaneous emission study and to their applications in other areas of quantum optics ,",
    "the question arises , is it an end to the autler - townes spectroscopy regarding its multiplicity ?",
    "we answer this question . we propose schemes for its generalization from the doublet and the triplet to quartuplet , quintuplet , and consequently to the higher - ordered multiplet spectroscopy . for the conceptual development of the mechanisms involved in these multiplet",
    "autler - townes spectroscopies we need to extend the concept to the schemes of five - level , six - level , seven - level and so on to multi - level atomic systems interacting appropriately with the required fields .",
    "to understand the fundamentals of these processes ideally we examined the laplace transform for the state - vector of these multi - state systems subjected to steady coherent illumination in the rotating wave approximation and weisskopf - wigner treatment of spontaneous emission as a simple probability loss .",
    "the results obtained under this way are very simple , readable and analytically interpretable .",
    "the lorentzian line - shaped spectrum then splits into five , six and larger numbered spectral components associated with five , six and large - numbered decaying dressed states of the bare energy state created by the atom - field interactions , respectively .",
    "initially we propose atomic schemes avoiding parity violation which can be found in the hyperfine structured sodium atom @xcite .",
    "however , for higher - ordered multiplet spectroscopy , the system becomes complicated and some of the decay processes may not be avoided .",
    "these may alter the ideal behavior of the system but the underlying physics we expect to be unaffected .",
    "for example , in autler - townes doublet and triplet schemes the complete dark lines feature gradually becomes insignificant with the increase in the other decay rates of the system @xcite .",
    "however , the general behavior of the system agrees with its ideal behavior .",
    "further , we also discuss various aspects of experimental feasibility of our models based on the fine structure sodium d1 line adjustable with a current experiment @xcite . here",
    "the only disadvantage is the complex atomic systems .",
    "however , these complexities are naturally inherited and the thing is to explore them for understanding the fundamental of the quantum interference processes responsible for these multiplicity in the spectra .",

    "ii we discuss sodium atom as a suitable experimental candidate for the realization of the different results of autler - townes multiplet spectroscopy . in section iii ,",
    "we extend the idea of the autler - townes doublet and triplet spectrum to the autler - townes quartuplet spectrum and calculate the analytical expression for it to discuss the basic mechanism involved in the interference processes in the atomic system . its experimental feasibility and also its adjustability with the current technology",

    "iv we propose another scheme to go a step beyond to demonstrate the autler - townes quintuplet spectrum .",
    "its experimental feasibility is also discussed in this section . in section",
    "v , we present the ways how to generalized the spectroscopy to the sextuplet and consequently to the higher - ordered ones . following the generalization we underline some expected complications .",
    "we also provide the details of how to handle these higher - ordered multiplet spectra mathematically and numerically .",
    "the section vi is devoted to the detail discussion of our main results .",
    "finally , the conclusion is presented at the end of this paper .",
    "the atomic sodium na@xmath1 is a alkali metal and is hydrogenoid having no complications like the atoms of multiple valence electrons . due to its versatility properties ,",
    "the sodium atom is famous in laboratories .",
    "sodium atom is very sensitive to strong fields and is useful in nonlinear studied .",
    "it is therefore considered a well suited candidate for use in research laboratories , particularly , in spectroscopic studies .",
    "further , the spectroscopic studies can be carried in the homogenous - broadened limit with an atomic beam or a magneto - optic trap ( mot ) , and the doppler - broadened features can be observed in a vapor cell or a heatpipe .",
    "the energy levels structure of the sodium atom in its hyperfine energy levels in the weak magnetic field is very much compatible with our various proposals for autler - townes multiplet atomic schemes .",
    "therefore we based the experimental proposals for quartuplet , quintuplet and consequently higher - ordered multiplet atomic schemes on the naturally available various excited states of the sodium atom .",
    "furthermore , we also take the support of a very important experiment conducted recently for multi - wave mixing by zuo _",
    "@xcite based on a sodium atom . in the experiment , they achieved eight - wave mixing in sodium atom having a folded five - level configuration in its fine structure .",
    "they suggested that their experiment is important for the future work and might be helpful for the coherent transient spectroscopy , autler - townes spectroscopy and eit .",
    "their method may also particularly provide new insight into the nature of highly excited states .",
    "following the facilities of multiple fields coupling with the sodium atom we underline the ways that how their experimental set - up is feasible and adjustable in the context of our proposed schemes if based on hyperfine energy levels of sodium d1 line for recording the spontaneous emission spectra .",
    "these feasibilities and adjustability are discussed in each section for each atomic scheme under the investigation .",
    "although we are interested in the experiment on the wave mixing in the context of spontaneous emission study , there are many other recently reported works yanp , zhiq , yig , chang , yanp01,chang01 related to this subject may be interesting for future studies of autler - townes multiplet spectroscopy .     shown as a dashed linkage , is responsible for the spectrum [ figure1],width=336 ]",
    "we propose a five - level atom with four as ground states hyperfine quadruplet and one excited state driven resonantly by two coherent and two microwave fields appropriately ( see fig .",
    "two pairs i.e. , @xmath2@xmath3 and @xmath4@xmath5 of the four ground hyperfine energy states @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath4 are driven by two microwave fields having rabi frequencies @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "similarly the excited state @xmath11 is coupled with the ground states @xmath6 and @xmath5 by two coherent driving fields having rabi frequencies @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the system forms the shape of loop structured configuration under these steps .",
    "furthermore the level @xmath14 is also coupled with the level @xmath8 via vacuum field modes .",
    "the coupling of the vacuum field modes only to this particular transition is reasonable , as in proposed configuration all transitions from the other states to @xmath8 are dipole forbidden .",
    "the naturally existing one decay processes makes our system the simplest ones due to the simply probability loss .",
    "this will leads to some ideal behavior regarding the quartuplet spectroscopy which is necessary for defining the fundamental of this system .",
    "more later , at the end of this section we match this scheme with current experiments that may capable us to realize the results of this spectroscopy in a laboratory .",
    "we also consider the resonant atom - field interaction therefore , the interaction picture and the rotating wave picture coincide for the coherent couplings .",

    "( [ 5 ] ) , @xmath35 @xmath36 appears for the effective rabi - frequency of the system .",
    "the spectrum vanishes when @xmath37 @xmath38 , yielding three dark lines in the spectrum dividing it into four spectral components .",
    "the height of all the spectral components are the same and can be calculated from the expression @xmath39 . during the derivation of the spectrum relation we assumed that the atom is initially prepared in the excited state @xmath11 .",
    "this way of handling the problem is mathematically correct for the ideal behavior .",
    "however , physically it might be difficult to place an atom in its excited state as soon as the atom enters the cavity to interact with other driving fields .",
    "thus from experimental point of view we ought to add the techniques or the mechanism of the process to prepare an atom in its excited state .",
    "this can be done very easily by coupling another field with the ground energy level and the level where the atom is required to prepare .",
    "this act will then bring the system into the context of resonance fluorescence where the results obtained under strong field limit will not match with the expected results of our system .",
    "however , the results obtained will match under weak field limit , in which the added field strength must be comparable with the decay rates , a well known phenomenon of resonance fluorescence in quantum optics .",
    "hence the assumption of initial state preparation is reasonable and experimentally incorporable . in our system",
    "we selected a particular nature of the interaction of the driving fields with the atom to form a loop preserving the phase effect in the system .",

    "satisfactorily , we will use the terminology of dressed states frequently for the explanation of our main results obtained by the bare statevector approach . the detailed analysis for the physical processes of the system in terms of dressed states basis",
    "is beyond the aim of this paper and will be discussed elsewhere",
    ". however , the analysis of our main results using bare statevector explains almost all the underlying physics of our system .",
    "next we continue with our bare statevector approach .",
    "to explore many facts about the mechanism involved in the phenomenon of quantum interference among the four decaying dressed states , we rewrite the above eq .",

    "we note that the interference terms compensate the contribution from the absolute squared terms at the location @xmath61  = @xmath62 @xmath63 .",

    ", width=336 ]    next we discuss the experimental feasibility of our loop structured five - level atomic scheme .",
    "we select the sodium d1 line having two fine structured energy levels .",
    "each state further splits into two hyperfine energy levels according to the usual coupling of the nuclear magnetic moment associated with the sodium nuclear spin and the internal atomic magnetic field by the total electronics angular momentum of the orbital spinning electron . for each hyperfine level , the f quantum number further splits into @xmath72 hyperfine sub - energy - level due to the earth magnetic field of strength 1 gauss .",
    "therefore , the sodium @xmath73 line has a total of 16 sub - energy level lines with 12 allowed transitions due selection and polarization rules of zeeman lines of a dipole transition .",
    "the hyperfine zeeman splitting within each hyperfine state of the @xmath73 line all lies in lower - frequency range of radio frequency ( rf ) range i.e. , @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 mhz .",

    "both are in the range of lower frequency side of the microwave .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to couple the ground hyperfine energy levels with microwave fields .",
    "the excited allowed zeeman energy levels of the @xmath80 state can then be coupled with the grounded hyperfine zeeman energy levels by optical frequency ranged laser fields .",
    "the simplification of the sixteen lines of the sodium @xmath73 into four hyperfine states have also been proposed in literature @xcite .",
    "the arguments employed are depended on linear polarization rules and the selection rules of the magnetic dipole allowed transitions . extending to five - level atomic we select the four ground states of d1 lines i.e. , @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 and one excited state @xmath84 the states @xmath85 and",
    "@xmath86 are coupled with the state @xmath87 by two microwave fields while they are coupled with the excited decaying state @xmath88 by two optical fields .",
    "the linkage of the excited state @xmath89 is considered with the ground state , @xmath90 via vacuum field modes .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that in our scheme the order of energy levels does not matter as we considering resonant atom fields interaction .",
    "the linkages of the closely spaced hyperfine states by microwave fields are usual in literature .",
    "for example , the upper two closely spaced decaying levels of the model scheme of quantum beat laser are prepared in coherent superposition by a microwave field . in our system",
    "the one linkage of the optical linkages is dipole forbidden following the selection rules of the zeeman splitting . however , there are experimental and theoretical methods where the linkages between the dipole forbidden transition may be made allowed by applying small statics magnetic of strength up to @xmath91 @xmath92 . for examples ,",
    "the dipole forbidden transition in the alkaline earth elements can be allowed by the linkage of this low statics electric field with appropriate levels , an experimental fact barber . moreover , in the model scheme of correlated spontaneous emission ( cel ) laser the dipole forbidden states are coupled with a strong coherent field to prepare the system in coherent superposition of the upper and the ground states of the cascaded three - level atomic system .",
    "however , the involvement of one decay process in this quartuplet system makes it an ideal ones to have ideal behavior for defining the fundamentals of even this complicated spectroscopy .",
    "this simply loss system is very much important as there is no simple mechanism in literature ( to the best of my knowledge ) to control the spontaneous decay in a system .",
    "moreover , the multiple ground states implementation for an atomic system are considered both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "next we discuss the experimental adjustability of our scheme with a very important experiment conducted recently for multi - wave mixing reported in @xcite . in the experiment they achieved eight - wave mixing in sodium atom having a folded five - level in the fine structure sodium atom .",
    "they suggested that their experiment is important for the future work and might be helpful for the coherent transient spectroscopy , autler - townes spectroscopy and eit . having the facilities of the linkages of multiple fields with the sodium atom it will be easy to go from fine to hyperfine zeeman splitting in the sodium d1 line due the technological facilities of the multiple - field couplings .",
    "we are required to link two microwave fields and two optical fields with the selected energy levels of the sodium d1 line for our system . the initially prepared excited state is then allowed to decay steadily to record the spectrum .    having quantum interference as a basic processes in the autler - townes multiplet spectroscopy",
    "we make a distinction with the coherent population trapping ( cpt ) , a phenomenon also arising of the same effect in the spontaneous emission studies @xcite .",
    "the area under the curve of spontaneous emission spectrum in the case of cpt is always less than the case when there is no quantum interference in the system .",
    "however , here in the autler - townes spectroscopy , there are dark lines in the spectrum arising because of quantum interferences among the decaying dressed states .",
    "the area under the curve in this case is almost the same as the one obtained from the lorentzian line shaped spectrum associated with a decaying bare energy state without its dressing .",
    "this fact is also evident from our multiplet schemes where the sum of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of all the spectral components are always almost equal to einstein s decay rate , @xmath0 , a decay rate that is normally associated with a decaying bare energy state without its dressing .",
    "the area under the curves of the spontaneous emission spectrum which representing the energy given out by the atom to environment are same in the case of autler - townes spectrum but not in the cpt case .",
    "this means some population is always trapped in an upper excited dressed energy state in cpt while almost no population trapping is there in autler - townes multiplet spectroscopy . in both the cpt and autler - townes multiplet spectra",
    "there is quantum interference but their approaches are different regarding its effect . in the later case",
    "there are dark lines in the spectrum of lorentzian line - shape while in the former there is complete elimination ( and not control ) of a spectral component .",
    "next , we modify our previous scheme for autler - townes quintuplet spectroscopy . these modifications can be carried in the previous system with a view to have a loop structured atom fields interaction .",
    "however , the needed single looped atom fields interaction is not unique and the problem can also be dealt for at least one loop in order to preserve the phase effect in the system .",
    "therefore the higher odd - ordered multiplet schemes can be handled through branches and loops if and only if there is no parity violation . in the present scheme ,",

    "physically , this is reasonable as the splitting of the dressed states are directly controlled by the strength of the driving fields .",
    "in fact , this is a relative phenomenon for this system regarding the effect of relative strengths on the spacing of the dressed states for this system .",
    "however , the combinational effect can then be dealt accordingly .",
    "this makes sense to having unequal spacing with the irregular strength of the driving fields avoiding the principle stated above .",
    "furthermore , if these correlations in the relative strength are carried in a systematic manner then the increase or decrease in the spacing of the peaks positions are also in a systematic manner following the principle stated above . if there are odd number of spectral components , for example the quintuplet which has one spectral component always at line center while the rest follow the same principle stated for the quartuplet .",
    "however , it is not difficult to generalize this principle for locations of spectral components of any order multiplet spectroscopy provided the system is subjected to the fine structured configuration of naturally existing atoms of simple probability loss .",
    "although there are symmetries among the different atomic schemes presented for different autler - townes multiplet spectra in this paper .",
    "however , these schemes are not unique and many other can be proposed to have a similar or related spectrum .",
    "there are number of atomic schemes in literatures having some similarities with our work .",
    "however a careful analysis is needed to interpret these results in association with the autler - townes multiplet spectra .",
    "we begin with the discussion of correlation of the autler - townes multiplet spectra with the existing literature concerning with the emission spectroscopy . in reference",
    "@xcite , the control of spontaneous emission is studied in a coherently driven four levels atomic system with an excited decaying bare energy state .",
    "this scheme is an approximate version of the autler - townes triplet spectrum @xcite . also , the work bibhas01 presented by bibhas and prasanta in a n - type atom driven by two coherent fields is also an approximated version of autler - townes triplet spectrum with introduction of an additional effect of collisional broadening .",
    "extreme line - width narrowing and broadening is observed in all the three spectral components agreeing with the autler - townes triplet spectrum",
    ".    moreover , ref .",
    "@xcite discussed the manipulations of absorption spectrum via double controlled destructive ( constructive ) interference via multiple routes to excitation in the four levels coherently driven atomic system .",
    "of course , they interpreted their results in connection with the eit and its utilization in logic gates , sensitive optical switches and quantum coherence information storage due to the dispersive properties of the medium . in their results",
    "two dark lines are always there which needs careful interpretation regarding autler - townes multiplet spectroscopy .",
    "a @xmath124-type four levels atomic scheme was conducted experimentally by chun - liang et al .",
    "@xcite for the absorption and dispersive properties of the medium in the context of specific emission processes .",
    "they demonstrated that double transparency windows with the controllable narrow central peak can be observed due to the spontaneously generated coherence ( sgc ) without the need of the rigorous condition of nearly degenerated levels .",
    "the double - transparency windows are normally resulting from the double dark lines in the absorption profile .",
    "these dark lines are traditionally traced back to the interference mechanism of fano type but is also the primary part of autler - townes multiplet spectroscopy @xcite under ideal conditions .",
    "therefore , these results can be best interpreted using fano type interference mechanism as an integral part of autler - townes multiplet spectroscopy . however , for large decay rates , the weisskopf wigner theory may not be satisfied regarding the widths and also the fano profile of the dark lines of the spectra may not be significant .",
    "next , the absorption and consequently the dispersive properties of the medium is also discussed in tripod type atom @xcite .",
    "again here the destructive interference mechanism in the excitation probabilities via three distinct paths to the three excited dressed state also requires interpretation of the results in the context of autler - townes triplet absorption spectroscopy .",
    "the two dark lines appearing in the spectrum lead to two transparency windows at two location on the frequency axis .",
    "the correlation of the autler - townes multiplet schemes with the other related schemes in the context of absorption spectra is broad in its range .",
    "however , all these studies are not necessarily having spectral narrowing in all components . further , to the best of our knowledge only autler - townes triplet type absorption schemes may be found in literature .",
    "generally , when the excited state is also coupled with a third level by strong laser field through an allowed electric dipole transition then the excitation signal is modified and it appears as two distinct components , a pattern often termed the autler - townes doublet , honoring those who first observed it @xcite . in refs . @xcite we extended their idea to three distinct components ( bright lines ) in a spontaneous emission spectrum by modifying their way of atom - field interaction and named in their honor as autler - townes triplet spectrum .",
    "we further proposed schemes for the generalization of autler - townes spectroscopy from doublet and triplet to quartuplet , quintuplet and , suggest linkages in sodium atom in which to display these spectra .",
    "we also underlined the way how to extend to more higher ordered multiplet spectroscopy . to understand the fundamentals of the processes ideally we examined the laplace transform for the statevector of these multi - state systems subjected to steady coherent illumination in the rotating wave approximation and weisskopf - wigner treatment of spontaneous emission as a simple probability loss .",
    "we learned from the study of different autler - townes multiplet schemes in which the single lorentzian line shaped spectrum can be divided into any number of spectral components depending on the nature of the atom , nature of required fields and their interactions . in this way we can split the decaying bare energy state into any number of dressed energy state playing a vital role in generating the processes of quantum interferences during the evolution of the systems .",
    "further , the widths of all the spectral components can be controlled through the relative strength of the laser fields in a way obeying weisskopf - wigner theory .",
    "this behavior is different from autler - townes doublet where no such an effect exists through the strength of the driving fields .",
    "furthermore , it is experimentally very easy to control the strength of the laser fields as these are externally controllable parameters . in this way",
    "an extreme line - width narrowing can be achieved in all the spectral lines resulting from the emission probabilities of all the dressed energy states of the bare energy state for the atom in all the schemes under investigation .",
    "the phenomenon of autler - townes multiplet spectroscopy can be realized experimentally in alkali metal , for example , na - atom @xcite , and molecule @xcite .",
    "further , if the interactions of the fields with the atoms or molecules are consider in a cavity then it is certain to include the velocity distribution and the decay terms due to the interaction with the buffer gas .",
    "this may modify some phenomenon presented in this paper ; however , the underlying physics of the quantum interference is still valid .",
    "furthermore , if the experiment is performed in magneto - optical - trap ( mot ) @xcite where the atomic temperature can be decreased up to few tents @xmath202 then the doppler broadening effect can be eliminated significantly .",
    "reliable quantitative analysis of the profiles of autler - townes multiplet spectroscopy including the peaks height , widths and spectral lines separation and dark line feature requires detailed modelling of relevant atomic or molecular states with all possible decaying rates , with inclusion of magnetic sub - degeneracy , doppler shift distribution , collisional broadening and many other decoherence processes .",
    "the complexities occurred due to increase in the number of laser fields interacting with the complex atomic systems are naturally inherited for the conceptual foundation of the mechanisms of the interference involved in the multiplet spectroscopy .",
    "however , in nature we are not limited to the domain of simple atomic systems .",
    "in fact there are complex structured atoms , molecules and clusters where the higher - ordered multiplet spectroscopy can be realized theoretically and experimentally .",
    "our proposed schemes for this higher - ordered multiplet spectroscopy will further open up new ways to explore , particularly , the physics of spontaneous emission , stimulated absorption , their population dynamics , multiwaves mixing and eit while generally , it may be of interest to some physicists and chemists working in the areas of laser spectroscopy , quantum optics and nonlinear optics .",
