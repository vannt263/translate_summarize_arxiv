    "the masses of galaxies are revealed by the gravitational interaction of their matter constituents , e.g. by stellar or gas kinematics or gravitational lensing effects .",
    "the caveat is that these effects rigorously constrain only the total amount of gravitating mass .",
    "the decomposition into luminous and dark matter relies on further assumptions .",
    "for example , in dynamical studies of early - type galaxies it is commonly assumed that the stellar mass distribution follows the light . any radial increase in the mass - to - light ratio  if needed to explain the observed velocities of the stars  is attributed to dark matter .",
    "the limitation of this approach becomes clear if one imagines a galaxy dark matter halo that follows the light distribution exactly .",
    "discriminating between luminous and dark matter according to their potentially different radial distributions would fail in this case .",
    "in fact , there would be no direct way to dynamically unravel the relative contributions of luminous and dark matter to the galaxy mass .",
    "it is unlikely that a real galaxy halo follows the light distribution exactly , yet it exemplifies the intrinsic degeneracies in any mass decomposition . on top of this ,",
    "even the most advanced present - day dynamical modelling techniques rely on symmetry assumptions and , often , also on the assumption of a steady - state dynamical system .",
    "if the symmetry assumptions are strongly violated , dynamical mass - to - light ratios can be biased by a factor of up to two @xcite .    to crosscheck the validity of the assumptions in dynamical modelling it is important to compare the resulting masses with other independent methods .",
    "_ total _ masses can be most directly compared to results from gravitational lensing , which is the first goal of this paper .",
    "an examination of the mass _ decomposition _ requires the investigation of a galaxy s stellar population .",
    "since the latter provides an independent measure of the stellar mass - to - light ratio , the comparison of dynamical and stellar - population masses yields further constraints on the dark matter content . in the above mentioned case ,",
    "for example , the dynamical mass - to - light ratio @xmath3 would exceed the corresponding stellar population value , indicating that some fraction of the galaxy s mass is actually dark matter .",
    "unfortunately , stellar population models do not provide unique stellar mass - to - light ratios .",
    "they suffer from an incomplete knowledge of the initial stellar mass function ( imf ) , as well as age - metallicity degeneracies .",
    "observations in and around our own galaxy indicate that the imf slope flattens below @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "recent spectroscopic observations of massive ellipticals in the near - infrared point towards the low - mass slope of the imf in these galaxies being steeper @xcite . yet , until now the imf in distant galaxies with unresolved stellar populations remains largely uncertain .",
    "this translates into a significant indeterminacy of population mass - to - light ratios : the steeper the slope at the low - mass end , the higher the population mass - to - light ratio .",
    "hence , the stellar population approach is not directly conclusive as a probe of the mass decomposition in dynamical models .",
    "conversely , if dynamical stellar mass determinations were free of ambiguities with respect to a dark matter contamination then they could serve as a measure for the slope of the imf in distant galaxies .",
    "the method would be to tweak the imf in the stellar population models until agreement with the dynamical stellar masses is achieved .    the ambiguities in both , dynamical stellar masses",
    "as well as stellar population models , make neither of the approaches directly applicable .",
    "nevertheless , comparing dynamical with stellar population models is important to ( 1 ) narrow down the dynamically plausible range of possible imfs and to ( 2 ) delimit the range of dark matter fractions compatible with observed stellar population properties .",
    "this is the second goal of the present paper in which we compare dynamical and stellar population masses in a sample of 16 coma early - type galaxies .",
    "our dynamical models account for both the full variety of possible orbit configurations in axisymmetric , flattened galaxies as well as for dark matter . in this respect",
    "we extend previous studies .",
    "@xcite , for example , used a similar modelling technique to compare dynamical and stellar population masses in the sauron sample , but they did not consider dark matter explicitly in their dynamical models .",
    "the justification for this neglect was the expected insignificance of dark matter in the central galaxy regions probed by the sauron observations ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "however , measuring only the sum of luminous and dark mass makes the comparison with stellar population models potentially uncertain .",
    "@xcite analysed a large sample of early - type galaxies taking into account the contribution from dark matter , but their models do not account for galaxy flattening and rotation .",
    "a subsample of the coma galaxies was recently analysed by @xcite . while they used multi - band photometry to derive stellar population properties ,",
    "our approach is to measure ages , metallicities and [ @xmath6/fe ] ratios from lick indices to reduce potential biases in population parameters .",
    "likewise , the analysis of slacs galaxies by @xcite , combining constraints from gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics , relied on multi - band photometry for the stellar population part .    mass - to - light ratios of early - type galaxies are of particular interest to understand the tilt of the fundamental plane .",
    "virial relations imply that the effective surface brightness @xmath7 , the effective radius @xmath8 and the central velocity dispersion @xmath9 in hot stellar systems are not independent of each other .",
    "this is revealed by the fundamental plane of early - type galaxies @xcite . yet , the observed fundamental plane is tilted with respect to the simple case of a virialised , homologous family of dynamical systems",
    ". this tilt can reflect ( 1 ) systematic variations of the luminosity distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) , ( 2 ) systematic variations of the orbital structure ( e.g. @xcite ) or ( 3 ) systematic variations of the mass - to - light ratio , as a result of varying stellar populations and/or dark matter distributions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "understanding these variations allows a deeper insight into the formation process of early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "most of the above mentioned effects can be factored out if additional information about the stellar populations and/or the mass distributions are available .",
    "aperture spectroscopy is one way to measure stellar population properties . by assuming simple scaling laws it can also provide estimates for dynamical masses , such that the contributions of stellar population and dynamical effects on the fundamental plane tilt can be disentangled ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "more reliable constraints come from radially resolved spectroscopy and detailed dynamical ( or lensing ) models of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the third goal of this paper is to follow the latter approach and to use the specific information contained in our two - component dynamical models for further investigations upon the origin of the fundamental plane tilt .",

    "if the imf is universal , then the increase in luminous dynamical masses must primarily come from a component of dark matter that follows the light very closely and is more important in more massive galaxies .",
    "the imf would be consistent with being kroupa in all early - types .",
    "independent of the actual slope of the stellar imf , luminous dynamical masses are _ on average _ more accurately predicted by assuming a salpeter imf : @xmath297 , but these masses may not represent exclusively stars . the kroupa imf yields @xmath185 . 5 .   adopting a kroupa imf and counting the excess mass @xmath224 as dark matter that follows",
    "the light doubles the average dark matter fractions inside @xmath8 to about @xmath298 .",
    "moreover , it yields a smooth trend between the resulting @xmath222 and galaxy velocity dispersion and , also , smooth dark matter halo profiles .",
    "the fp tilt is not a pure stellar population effect .",
    "further inferences about the tilt depend on the interpretation of the observed @xmath175 . as above ,",
    "that the tilt reduces when considering the dynamical mass @xmath287 that follows the light could be due to ( 1 ) variations in the relative distribution of luminous and dark matter or ( 2 ) imf variability .",
