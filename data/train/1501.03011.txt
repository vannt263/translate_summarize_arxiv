    "might this hold in all generality ?",
    "we discuss briefly the two main obstructions for this .",
    "the strength of our approach deeply relies on the complexity of @xmath194-truncated analytic factorization .",
    "this is a crucial problem in singularity theory .",
    "one approach in characteristic zero or @xmath919 is to compute the rational puiseux series .",
    "there are well known algorithms for this , with actual complexity @xmath920 in terms of the total degree @xmath31 of @xmath5 in the case of finite fields @xcite .",
    "this complexity is a bit too large for our purpose , but the authors told us that they recently developped a @xmath921 complexity algorithm .",
    "this is the same complexity as for absolute factorization . in order to fit also in the rational factorization complexity class",
    ", we would need @xmath922 for analytic factorization .",
    "this is an open problem .",
    "note that there exists algorithms for testing local analytic irreducibility of a germ of curve that do not require the use of puiseux series .",
    "the main ingredient is that of _ approximate roots _ and makes essentialy use of resultants computations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "up to our knowledge , no complexity analysis have been done yet .",
    "we do nt know if approximate roots could lead to fast analytic factorization that would avoid puiseux series computations .",
    "in characteristic @xmath923 , the concept of puiseux series does not make sense and analytic factorization is a much more delicate problem .",
    "see for instance @xcite for the generalization of puiseux series in small positive characteristic .",
    "even if we get a fast algorithm for computing the @xmath194-truncated analytic factors , our brute force analysis of the recombination problem in this paper led to a complexity @xmath924 .",
    "however , the polynomials @xmath925^{n+1 } $ ] we want to recombine have a very particular structure .",
    "namely , they vanish with very high order at some points of the curve @xmath110",
    ". an approach could be to write these polynomials in a basis constitued of adjoint polynomials .",
    "the number of required equations for solving recombinations ( divisibility test by @xmath5 or closedness of differential forms ) would then decreaze .",
    "this fact is illutrated in some of our previous works , where we studied the relations beetween resolution of singularities and factorization @xcite or toric genometry and factorization @xcite .",
    "namely we developed factorization algorithms whose linear algebra steps belongs to @xmath926 , with @xmath927 being the arithmetic genus of the strict transform of the curve @xmath110 after some sequences of blowing - ups .",
