    "the supernova remnant ( snr ) g1.9 + 0.3 has recently been shown to have expanded by about 16% between 1985 and 2007 , implying an age of order 100 years  the youngest supernova remnant in the galaxy ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) . the expansion was confirmed with new vla observations from march 2008 @xcite . the x - ray and current radio images",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is featureless and well described by the loss - steepened tail of the synchrotron spectrum inferred from radio frequencies .",
    "no thermal x - ray emission is apparent .",
    "g1.9 + 0.3  provides a unique opportunity to study a snr at a stage never before observed , and to learn about the physics of shock acceleration in faster shocks than seen in any snr ( @xmath6 km s@xmath7 ; paper i ) .",
    "a simple model of a power - law electron distribution with an exponential cutoff at energy @xmath8 producing synchrotron radiation ( xspec model srcut ) has proved to be a useful tool in understanding x - ray synchrotron spectra in those dozen or so snrs in which the phenomenon is observed @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum cuts off more slowly than exponential , roughly as @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "in addition to foreground absorption , this model requires three parameters : a 1 ghz radio flux @xmath10 , a mean radio - to - x - ray spectral index @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , and a rolloff frequency @xmath4 , the `` critical frequency '' for electrons with energy @xmath8 , related to @xmath8 by @xmath13 tev . in applying this model in paper i",
    ", we used @xmath14 jy , and obtained @xmath15 hz , but with a very high absorbing column density , @xmath16 @xmath1 , implying significant scattering by dust along the line of sight .",
    "such scattering removes photons from the source and distributes them in a faint halo out to arcminute distances , but can also redistribute photons across the source , in both cases in an energy - dependent fashion .",
    "below we present a reanalysis of the _ chandra _ observation using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) techniques , including the effects of dust scattering , with an emphasis on characterizing spatial variations .",
    "such variations hold important information on how the acceleration of electrons and/or magnetic - field amplification depends on different conditions such as shock speed and the obliquity angle @xmath5  between the shock normal and upstream magnetic field , information crucial in understanding shock acceleration in different astrophysical environments .",
    "radial averages of _ chandra _ data show a dust - scattered halo out to about @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the spectral analysis of g1.9 + 0.3 must be conducted jointly with a halo analysis .",
    "first , we refit the integrated spectrum without scattering , using a different abundance set for absorption @xcite , and a slightly different , improved background model .",
    "we then performed a joint analysis of the background - subtracted spectra from the source ( innermost ellipse ) and halo ( between two outer ellipses ) regions shown in figure  [ haloimspec ] .",
    "we consider a simple uniform dust distribution along the line of sight to g1.9 + 0.3 , using total and differential x - ray scattering cross sections from @xcite .",
    "small - angle scattering by dust out of the g1.9 + 0.3 source extraction region attenuates the x - ray spectrum by a factor of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the energy - dependent optical depth for scattering , and @xmath20 is the energy - dependent fraction of photons that have been scattered into the source extraction region . unless there are large quantities of dust in the immediate vicinity of the snr , it is sufficient to consider only singly scattered photons in the second term containing @xmath20 .",
    "the fraction of singly scattered photons is equal to @xmath21 ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so scattering attenuates the source spectrum by @xmath22 .",
    "the fraction @xmath20 depends on the assumed dust distribution and the spatial structure of the x - ray emitting gas . for a point source",
    ", the angular distribution of singly - scattered photons can be readily found from eq .",
    "( 19 ) of @xcite .",
    "we approximated the spatial structure of g1.9 + 0.3 by the platelet - smoothed ( willett 2007 ) image shown in figure  [ xrim ] , and convolved it with the model point source halo to arrive at @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , the halo region flux is proportional to @xmath23 , or @xmath24 for singly scattered photons .",
    "we neglect multiply scattered photons in modeling of the g1.9 + 0.3 dust halo  this underpredicts the halo intensity at low energies where @xmath19 exceeds unity , by at most 30% and probably less ( smith et al .",
    "we investigated the effect of the _ chandra _ point - spread function ( psf ) , but found that only about 1% of the snr flux at high energies is scattered within the telescope into the halo extraction annulus .",
    "we performed joint modeling of the g1.9 + 0.3 and halo spectra within the xspec software package @xcite , with dust scattering and psf effects implemented as local multiplicative models .",
    "model input parameters are energy - dependent functions @xmath25 ( the energy - dependent fraction of the snr flux scattered into the halo extraction region ) , @xmath20 , and @xmath26 , and a scalar parameter @xmath27 that provides scaling for @xmath19 in terms of the effective h column density for dust scattering . under a single - scattering approximation , @xmath20 and @xmath26 depend only on the dust distribution along the line of sight , not on @xmath19 , so they may be specified prior to modeling spectra .",
    "we use the srcut model described above for the intrinsic x - ray spectrum . while background subtracted spectra are shown for clarity in figure [ haloimspec ] , we do not subtract background prior to modeling so that we may use mcmc methods as implemented in xspec and pymc .",
    "we determined the normalization parameter @xmath10 from our 1.5 ghz radio image , extrapolated to 1 ghz using a spectral index of 0.62 @xcite , obtaining a value of 1.17 jy ( under the possibly incorrect assumption that all the radio flux comes from the same population of electrons as produces the x - rays ) .",
    "the absorbing and scattering column densities may differ if any of the assumptions underlying our uniform - dust model break down , e.g. , an excess of dust local to the snr will not affect absorption but will reduce large - angle scattering , resulting in @xmath28 .",
    "it is important to model the background correctly in view of the faintness of the dust scattered halo .",
    "we extracted a background spectrum from a large ( @xmath29 in size ) region on the acis s3 chip beyond the dust - scattered halo . to separate sky and particle backgrounds , we also extracted spectra from the most recent stowed ( particle only ) acis s3 background file available online at the cxc .",
    "this particle - only spectrum was fit with a combination of gaussians and power laws , exponentially cut off on both ends .",
    "we then modeled our background spectrum as a combination of a sky background , consisting of two absorbed power laws , and a particle - only background ( allowing for change in intensity only ) .",
    "this fit , after appropriate scaling and again allowing for variations in the particle background intensity , was used in the modeling reported below .",
    "the bayesian mcmc methods require specification of priors on unknown ( fitted ) parameters .",
    "uniform , noninformative priors were used for @xmath30 , @xmath27 , @xmath11 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , with the following exceptions . in the spatially - resolved five - region analysis , we employed a normal prior for @xmath11 with the measured radio index of 0.62 and estimated standard ( 1 @xmath34 ) error of 0.02 . a normal prior for @xmath30",
    "was assumed for protruding se and nw extensions ( `` ears '' ) , based on results of that fit . since results are prior - dependent in this case , we also imposed an upper cutoff of @xmath35 hz on the corresponding prior , as theoretical considerations make higher rolloff frequencies unlikely .",
    "we quantified the azimuthal brightness variations obvious in figure  [ xrim ] by circumscribing the shell with an elliptical annulus of width @xmath36 , and dividing it into 18 equal segments .",
    "we found about a factor of 6 variation between the bright nw and se limbs and the fainter regions between .",
    "table  [ fitsc ] shows results for modeling the integrated spectrum with the srcut model .",
    "column 1 shows the improved no - scattering parameter values ( means derived from mcmc chains ) and their 5 and 95 percentile scores .",
    "column 2 shows the corresponding values with our simple scattering model . the chief difference is a lowering of @xmath4by about",
    "the new value , @xmath37 hz ( @xmath38 kev ) is still among the highest for a shell snr . in the third and fourth columns we give results from a two - zone model , with the zones comprising most of the bright emission from the se and nw limbs , in addition to a halo .",
    "absorptions were tied together for the two regions , while the contribution from scattering from the `` missing '' faint limbs and center was accounted for by artificially increasing scattering by 20% , required to obtain consistency in the derived @xmath30 values with the value from the spatially - integrated model .",
    "the spectral indices @xmath11 differ at the 99.98% level , and @xmath4  values at the 94% level . a similar simulation neglecting dust scattering gave qualitatively similar results but higher @xmath4  values by over a factor of 2 , indicating the importance of including dust scattering .",
    "these regions include about 80% of the x - ray counts , but less than half the radio , suggesting that some of the radio flux may not be associated with the blast wave .",
    "spectral results at higher angular resolution are desirable .",
    "we subdivided g1.9 + 0.3  into six regions as shown in figure  [ haloimspec ] , but the x - ray data were not adequate to permit the use of the scattering model .",
    "since scattering moves photons both out of the source and from brighter regions into fainter ones , the predominant effect is to smooth gradients , in both total brightness and spectrum , so these results should underestimate the true spatial variations . for a model - independent description of the observed data , we described the six regions simultaneously with power laws , tying the absorption columns together , but we also performed srcut modeling . here",
    "the clearly discrepant radio properties of the `` ears '' made it necessary to impose a different prior on @xmath11 ( flat ) than for the five regions within the source ellipse , so the `` ears '' modeling was performed separately .",
    "we also bounded the flat prior on log @xmath4  by log @xmath39 .",
    "table  [ fit6 ] gives both power - law photon indices @xmath32 ( @xmath40 ph @xmath1 s@xmath7 ) and srcut parameters .",
    "the systematic trends with brightness are apparent : the opposing bright limbs of the shell have harder spectra ( either lower @xmath32 or higher @xmath4 ) than the center , and the spectra soften also moving to the interior .",
    "the projecting fainter `` ears '' beyond the e and w peaks were combined for better statistics , and have the flattest spectra of all .",
    "the correlation of x - ray brightness with @xmath4strongly suggests a single cause . our primary observational result is this systematic variation of spectral hardness , correlated with brightness .",
    "a complete dust - scattering model , including the effects of scattering back into source regions , applied to the spatially resolved data will require better x - ray data , but while the numerical values for @xmath4  will change somewhat , we do not expect these trends to be reversed .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    1 .",
    "including dust scattering lowers @xmath4  by about 50% in the integrated spectrum , and by factors of more than 2 in the two - region fit , significantly lowering the inferred maximum electron energies .",
    "the @xmath4  values are still among the highest ever reported .",
    "the mean spectrum between radio and x - rays is significantly flatter in the se than in radio alone for our two - zone model .",
    "2 .   both x - ray brightness and spectral flatness or @xmath4  show strong bilateral symmetry .",
    "as one moves away from the bright se and nw limbs in azimuth or toward the center , the mean surface brightness drops by at least 6 , while values of @xmath4  drop by about an order of magnitude .",
    "the radio structure is dominated by a bright shell with somewhat smaller peak radius than the x - ray shell , and a single intensity maximum .",
    "the `` ears '' extending beyond the se and nw rims in x - rays show the hardest spectra of all , and are not detected at radio wavelengths .",
    "the relatively poor correlation of radio and x - ray brightness around the shell , and the smaller radius of the peak of the radio shell , suggest that much of the radio emission may not originate at the outer blast wave , but further inside , perhaps due to electron acceleration and/or turbulent magnetic - field amplification at the contact discontinuity between shocked ism and shocked ejecta , as is probably the case in cas a ( e.g. , cowsik & sarkar 1984 ) .",
    "we focus on the x - ray structure and spectra .    in principle",
    ", the systematic azimuthal brightness variations could be due to an inhomogeneous upstream medium that has the bilateral symmetry of g1.9 + 0.3 .",
    "this explanation requires higher densities in the se and nw , where they would be expected to impede the expansion .",
    "however , the remnant has a larger se - nw than ne - sw diameter .",
    "it is equally unlikely to imagine systematically larger magnetic fields on opposite sides of the remnant .",
    "however , the observed simple bilateral symmetry of both brightness and spectral variations can arise naturally if electron injection , acceleration rate , or magnetic - field amplification depend somehow on shock obliquity @xmath5 .",
    "( the physical origin of such dependences is not clear . )",
    "if the magnetic field is roughly uniform and not too far from the plane of the sky , then as a spherical shock encounters it , the obliquity angle around the remnant periphery will vary with the observed bilateral symmetry .",
    "that explanation essentially requires the supernova to be type ia , as a core - collapse supernova is expected to expand into stellar - wind material with a frozen - in magnetic field in a tightly wound parker spiral ( roughly azimuthally oriented ) with all obliquities therefore near @xmath41 .",
    "synchrotron brightness from a power - law distribution of electrons @xmath42 varies as @xmath43 .",
    "the electron energy density can vary with obliquity if the injection or acceleration rate depends on @xmath5 , while the magnetic - field strength will vary due to simple flux - freezing and shock compression of the tangential component , and possibly also to turbulent amplification due to cosmic - ray - induced instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a process which might also have obliquity dependence . however , in all known cases , x - ray synchrotron emission is produced by electrons on the loss - steepened tail of a power - law distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , introducing a third parameter .",
    "for the simple srcut model , that parameter is the rolloff frequency @xmath44 x - ray brightness will vary even for constant @xmath45 and @xmath46 if @xmath4  varies , and brighter regions will have harder spectra .    for a uniform upstream magnetic field",
    ", if the post - shock field is simply compressed , a strong - shock compression ratio of 4 will produce post - shock magnetic fields four times larger where the shock is perpendicular ( @xmath5@xmath47 ) , and hence a larger synchrotron emissivity by @xmath48 compared to where @xmath5@xmath49 ( using @xmath50 ; green et al .",
    "this is adequate to explain the required factor of about 6 , but would imply that the bright limbs are projections of an equatorial `` belt '' which might be detectable across the remnant center in a deeper observation .",
    "standard first - order fermi shock acceleration in the test - particle limit predicts a spectral index @xmath51 for a strong shock .",
    "steeper radio indices are universal in young remnants , perhaps indicating cosmic - ray - modified shocks ( e.g. , reynolds & ellison 1992 ) .",
    "we find a steeper radio - to - x - ray value of @xmath11 than that in the radio alone , consistent with the expectation of modified shocks .",
    "better radio data will be required to confirm the radio index and search for possible spatial variations .",
    "in fermi shock acceleration , three possible limitations on @xmath52 are synchrotron losses ( @xmath53 ) , finite age ( or size ; @xmath54 ) , and escape due to an abrupt change in upstream diffusion properties ( @xmath55)(reynolds 1998 ) .",
    "these depend differently on physical parameters , including shock obliquity , which may affect the acceleration rates @xcite . if we lump all such obliquity dependence into a factor @xmath56 , the corresponding rolloff frequencies obey @xmath57 and we have @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the upstream and downstream magnetic - field strengths , respectively , @xmath61 cm s@xmath62 and @xmath63 is a wavelength of mhd waves above which the diffusion coefficient is assumed to jump to much larger values , mimicking the absence of longer waves capable of scattering more energetic particles .",
    "the absence of @xmath46-dependence in @xmath64 means that if electron energies are limited by radiative losses , the different spectral slopes can not be produced purely by varying the magnetic field .",
    "the strong shock - speed dependence could produce a significant effect ; but the observed order - of - magnitude variation in @xmath4  would require a greater variation in @xmath65 than seems consistent with the remnant s circular outline to within about 10% .    since @xmath66 is obliquity - dependent , either age - limited ( case 2 ) or escape - limited ( case 3 ) acceleration can explain some spectral variations with obliquity even if @xmath67",
    ". a non - linear variant of escape - limited acceleration in which @xmath63 grows as increasingly higher - energy particles escape might be able to provide the observed range ; otherwise one expects @xmath63 roughly constant , a property of the upstream medium , giving a maximum variation of @xmath68 of 4 or so .",
    "age - limited acceleration could easily accomplish this without additional obliquity - dependence , since @xmath69 will vary by a factor of at least 64 .",
    "we conclude that a minimal explanation of both brightness and spectral variations is interaction of the blast wave with a roughly uniform magnetic field parallel to the bright rims ( roughly sw  ne ) , with no additional obliquity - dependence of either electron injection or of acceleration rates . in that case",
    ", the `` ears '' must represent enhanced upstream diffusion where the shock is perpendicular , which seems unlikely since cross - field diffusion mean free paths are probably limited to the gyroradius .",
    "however , a preshock - diffusion explanation is consistent with the lack of radio emission from the `` ears '' ( as lower - energy radio - emitting electrons would not diffuse as far ahead of the shock ) . in this case ,",
    "an srcut model for the `` ears '' would not be appropriate , as already suggested by their discrepant value of @xmath11 .",
    "an alternative explanation involves a magnetic field in which the shock is parallel at the `` ears . ''",
    "this would almost certainly require enough turbulent amplification of magnetic field to swamp the frozen - in field increase where the shock is perpendicular .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field would need to be quite close to the plane of the sky , so that the bright limbs , now `` polar caps '' seen edge - on , are at the edge of the remnant in projection .",
    "the same requirement occurs for this geometry in sn 1006 .",
    "strong magnetic - field amplification probably requires efficient shock acceleration , so that a population of energetic ions is implied .",
    "however , for any magnetic - field geometry , effects due solely to magnetic - field dependence of acceleration time can not produce the spectral variations if electron acceleration is limited by synchrotron losses .",
    "currently scheduled observations may allow considerable clarification .",
    "our 250-ks _ chandra _ follow - up , and the higher - resolution vla study we have undertaken , should allow better understanding of the relation of radio to x - ray electron populations , better characterization of the scattering , and better deduction of spatially resolved spectral properties .",
    "g1.9 + 0.3  will provide valuable constraints on the obliquity - dependence of shock acceleration and magnetic - field amplification .",
