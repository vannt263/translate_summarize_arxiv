    "hot stars wind properties depend on the stellar metallicity .",
    "low - metallicity environment of smc offers a possibility to study this dependence . for this purpose",
    "we apply wind models of @xcite .",
    "wind parameters of smc stars predicted by our code were compared with that derived from observations by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there is a relatively good agreement between predicted and observed terminal velocities ( see fig .",
    "[ poro ] ) with few exceptions .",
    "the mean value of @xmath1 is slightly lower than that of galactic o stars .",
    "this may indicate that smc terminal velocities are slightly lower than that of galactic stars .",
    "there is a good agreement between calculated and observed mass - loss rates for stars with high mass - loss rates ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , there is a significant disagreement between theoretical and observed values for stars with low mass - loss rates ( @xmath3 ) . in this case",
    "the predicted mass - loss rates are more than ten times higher than the observed ones @xcite .",
    "hot star winds have a multicomponent nature which for low - density or low - metallicity flow influences the wind structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to test the importance of multicomponent effects we calculated models with wind components sulphur , remaining metals , h - he component and electrons .    for stars with relatively good agreement between observed and predicted mass - loss rates the multicomponent structure can be neglected . on the other hand , for stars with systematically too high predicted mass - loss rates either the decoupling of wind components occurs or the frictional heating is important . in this case",
    "the decoupling instability may lower the mass - loss rate .",
    "this may be an explanation of too high predicted mass - loss rates .",
    "however , only for one star studied the decoupling occurs for velocities lower than the terminal velocity .",
    "improved model treatment may help to provide more consistent explanation .",
    "to study the variations of wind parameters with metallicity we recalculated wind models with the same stellar parameters , however with metallicity @xmath4 times higher . for higher metallicity",
    "the mass loss rate is higher , @xmath5 the terminal velocity varies with metallicity only slightly , on average @xmath6 .",
