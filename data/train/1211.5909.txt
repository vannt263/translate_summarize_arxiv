    "a divergence in the value of @xmath233 announces a second order phase transition as derived in subsection  [ 4a11 ] .",
    "@xmath424 diverges at @xmath426 too but this equation , based on the analysis made in sects .",
    "[ 4a11 ] and  [ 4a12 ] , represents no physical effect .",
    "this is a pathologic effect attributable to the fact that the metric   becomes singular at @xmath426 .",
    "the second geometric method was developed later by liu - lu - luo - shao ( llls )  @xcite .",
    "the method relies on the same principal as the first one in that any singularity in the curvature scalar of the associated metric signals a second order phase transition of the system .",
    "the metric of this space is simply the hessian matrix of the helmholtz free energy which , in the ce , is given by @xmath427 using the expressions  ( [ 3.3 ] ) and  ( [ 3.4 ] ) , ( [ 5.5 ] ) becomes @xmath428{{\\rm d}}s^2 + 8s^2{{\\rm d}}q^2\\}\\qquad ( { { \\rm d}}l^{2}_{\\text{gtd}}=y{{\\rm d}}l^{2}_{\\text{llls}})\\,.\\ ] ] this metric provides the following curvature scalar @xmath429}{32s^4}\\,x^2\\,.\\ ] ] here again we clearly see that the divergence of the curvature scalar ( [ 5.7 ] ) corresponds to that of @xmath233 , thus by the llls method we are too able to locate the points where the second order phase transition takes place .",
    "we have seen that asymptotically flat rn surrounded by have higher entropies than ordinary ones .",
    "the excess in entropy is attributable to the entropy of matter . for a given value of the density @xmath95 , they commulate more electric charges than ordinary rn holes before they become naked singularities . for @xmath113 , the maximum relative cumulated charge",
    "@xmath430 is proportional to @xmath431 , if @xmath63 , or to @xmath432 , if @xmath116 .",
    "taking @xmath95 as a thermodynamic variable , as some works have done for the cosmological constant  @xcite and for @xmath95 also  @xcite , we have obtained the generalized smarr formula and the first law of thermodynamics .    as one charges adiabatically an ordinary rn , it cumulates mass and charge till their total values equate the radius of the horizon , which remains constant during the process .",
    "if the rn is surrounded by then it will cumulate more mass and charge , however , with their totals never exceeding the radius of the horizon .    applying the classical thermodynamic method and restricting ourselves to the ce we have obtained generalized conditions for local stability of rn surrounded by .",
    "these conditions are the shifting of the known ones for ordinary rn if fluctuations in @xmath130 are not allowed ; if @xmath130 fluctuates , the same conditions apply with their upper limits constrained to lower values .",
    "we have reached the conclusion that , allowing fluctuations in @xmath433 , only with low entropy , or high charge or both are stable , while with relatively high entropy , or low charge or both are stable against fluctuations in @xmath434 only . between these and the other states there is a behavioral change maintaining the sign of @xmath233 .",
    "we have also shown that the ce is unstable if all thermodynamic variables are allowed to vary .",
    "we have completed the analysis of stability by applying the tpm and obtained an upper limit for the temperature [ @xmath435 beyond which the ce is no longer stable , if fluctuations in @xmath130 are not allowed .",
    "for ordinary rn @xmath381 .",
    "if @xmath130 fluctuates , we have obtained an upper limit for the electric potential on the horizon [ @xmath436 beyond which the ce is no longer stable .",
    "another general result we could derive is that isolated , which constitute mes , are stable .    by the two geometrical method ( gtd , llls ) we could also determine the states corresponding to a second order phase transition .",
    "the stability of non - asymptotically flat solutions is more involved and constitutes the matter of a subsequent work along with the case where @xmath95 fluctuates .",
    "m.  e.  rodrigues thanks the ufes for the hospitality he has enjoyed during the development of this work and thanks the cnpq for partial financial support .",
    "in this section we extend the work done in subsection  [ 4a ] , that is we will only discuss the ce case within the context of the classical thermodynamic approach allowing @xmath95 to vary .",
    "we consider the general case , ( @xmath437 ) , of a immersed in a thermal bath at constant temperature .",
    "using   along with @xmath438 and the fact that @xmath439 , which is derived from  , we arrive at the following hessian equilibrium condition that generalizes   @xmath440 [ the hessian condition   is represented by the upper left 2@xmath4412 block of the above 3@xmath4413 @xmath442 matrix ] . to satisfy the equilibrium condition  , all the eigenvalues ( @xmath443 ) of the 3@xmath4413 @xmath442 matrix should be positive .",
    "the characteristic polynomial of @xmath442 is brought to the form @xmath444p^2\\\\+\\{t(\\partial a_0/\\partial q)_{s , c}-c_q[(\\partial t/\\partial q)_{s , c}^2+(\\partial t/\\partial c)_{s , q}^2]\\}p+c_q(\\partial a_0/\\partial q)_{s , c}(\\partial t/\\partial c)_{s , q}^2.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] now , by   we have @xmath445 , thus in   the coefficient of @xmath446 , @xmath233 , and the independent term , @xmath447 , have the same sign .",
    "consequently , the three eigenvalues ( @xmath443 ) ca nt _ all _ be positive and this implies that the ce is unstable if @xmath95 is allowed to vary .",
