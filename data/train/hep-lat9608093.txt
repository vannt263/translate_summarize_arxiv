    "the hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm@xcite is now the standard method to simulate dynamical fermions .",
    "however the cost of the algorithm is substantial .",
    "it is therefore desirable to improve the efficiency of the hmc algorithm .",
    "first , we examine the possibility of changing the step size adaptively@xcite .",
    "second , we implement the hmc algorithm with approximate hamiltonians .",
    "lastly , we precondition the fermionic action used in the hmc algorithm .",
    "the conventional hmc algorithm is performed with a fixed step size .",
    "one expects however that the molecular dynamics ( md ) trajectory will bounce off the effective energy barrier represented by the minimum of the fermionic determinant . as it does , the curvature increases and so does the integration error .",
    "this effect should be more pronounced for smaller quark masses .",
    "therefore one might expect , in that regime , benefits from varying the step size adaptively .    the naive way to adapt the step size",
    "consists in keeping the local error constant at each integration step . but",
    "care must be taken to preserve time - reversibility .",
    "stoffer has constructed a time - reversible adaptive step size method which gave promising gains on the kepler problem@xcite . here",
    "we implement this method for the hmc algorithm .",
    "call @xmath0 a one - step integrator ; @xmath1 .",
    "it maps momenta and link variables @xmath2 onto @xmath3 .",
    "now we define a symmetric error estimator , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a local error at @xmath2 when the system is integrated by @xmath0 .",
    "if the integrator is reversible , eq.([es ] ) is obviously symmetric under the exchange @xmath6 .",
    "the adaptive step size @xmath7 is then determined by solving a symmetric error equation , @xmath8 the tolerance should be kept constant during the md simulation . the adaptive step size determined by eq.([tol ] ) takes the same value at the reflected point @xmath9 . therefore an integrator with the adaptive step size determined by eq.([tol ] ) is reversible . taking for @xmath10 the standard leapfrog integrator , we tested the above method for several quark masses , volumes and couplings@xcite .",
    "we observed that the variance of the step size increases as @xmath11 increases , as expected .",
    "however , it decreases as the volume increases .",
    "thus the gain over hmc with fixed step size turns out to be very small .",
    "the overhead to determine the adaptive step size by solving eq.([tol ] ) exceeds this gain .",
    "the leapfrog integrator with step size @xmath7 has @xmath12 errors , resulting in an energy violation @xmath13 , which reduces the metropolis acceptance . since such errors are present anyway ,",
    "there is no need to keep for the molecular dynamics hamiltonian @xmath14 the exact hamiltonian @xmath15 .",
    "an approximate hamiltonian @xmath14 which introduces errors of similar magnitude can be substituted at cheaper cost .",
    "the cost of the hmc algorithm is expressed by the cumulated cost of fermionic force evaluations per accepted trajectory : @xmath16 for trajectories of a certain fixed length , where @xmath17 is the number of multiplications by the dirac operator @xmath18 at each step of size @xmath7 . in the following ,",
    "we consider two possibilities to decrease @xmath17 and try to find the minimum cost @xmath19 .",
    "lscher proposed to approximate the inverse of the fermion matrix @xmath18 by a chebyshev polynomial @xmath20@xcite of degree @xmath21 with zeroes @xmath22 : @xmath23[cheb ] this approximation allows the construction of a local update algorithm with @xmath21 auxiliary bosonic fields@xcite .",
    "here we use the same approximation for the inverse of the fermion matrix which appears in the molecular dynamics hamiltonian : @xmath24 this formulation does not require any linear solver .",
    "the fermionic force evaluation requires instead a predetermined @xmath25 multiplications by @xmath18 .",
    "as @xmath21 is reduced however , the approximation ( [ cheb ] ) increases the energy violation , which reduces the metropolis acceptance .",
    "fig.[fig : chebyshev](a ) shows the efficiency @xmath26 vs. @xmath7 .",
    "we find that the optimal step - size depends little on the degree @xmath21 of the polynomial .",
    "for the optimal @xmath21 , the work is reduced by about 4 over standard hmc .",
    "usually , in the molecular dynamics steps , the linear system which gives the fermionic force is solved to high accuracy .",
    "the initial guess to the solution of this linear system can then be extrapolated from previous results without measurably spoiling time - reversibility . in this way",
    ", the number of iterations in the solver can be reduced by a factor @xmath27 2@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is also possible to reduce the accuracy in the solver , provided that the solution is time - reversible .",
    "this is achieved simply by forfeiting the benefits of time extrapolation , and taking always the same initial guess for the solver .",
    "while this second approach is well - known , its benefits have not been studied to a comparable extent .    here",
    "we systematically investigate the optimal accuracy , which minimizes the cost of hmc , by varying the stopping criterion in the solver . in this case , the actual form of the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath14 can not be known .",
    "fig.[fig : chebyshev](b ) shows efficiency , acceptance and number of iterations .",
    "the number of iterations linearly decreases with the logarithm of the stopping criterion . on the other hand ,",
    "the acceptance remains practically constant up to a certain stopping criterion and then rapidly decreases .",
    "we measure the efficiency by @xmath28 .",
    "the figure clearly shows that a low accuracy stopping criterion ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 on @xmath31 and @xmath32 lattices , respectively ) is most efficient .",
    "however the gain over standard hmc ( @xmath33 ) appears to decrease as the volume increases .",
    "the use of preconditioners is well - known for the solution of linear systems , like the one which gives the fermionic force @xmath34 at each step . on the other hand ,",
    "little attention has been paid to preconditioning the fermionic action itself .",
    "one exception is even - odd preconditioning : @xmath35 where @xmath36 this formulation is widely used to reduce memory requirements and work per force evaluation .",
    "what has not been noticed is that the fermionic force from ( [ sf ] ) is smaller than in the non - preconditioned case ( see fig.[fig : force ] ) , allowing for an increase in the step - size without loss of acceptance .",
    "this benefit stems from the better conditioning of @xmath37 ( to order @xmath38 ) than @xmath18 ( to order @xmath11 ) .",
    "this preconditioning can be pushed to higher order with virtually no overhead .",
    "consider the partitioning of @xmath37 : @xmath39 where + ( - ) stands for the lower(upper ) triangular part .",
    "the lower(upper ) triangular matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 have determinant @xmath42 .",
    "the preconditioned matrix @xmath43 can then be substituted to @xmath37 in the fermionic action : @xmath44^{-1 } \\phi_e \\nonumber \\\\      & = & \\phi_e^\\dagger(ud_{ee}^{-1}l)(l^\\dagger d_{ee}^{\\dagger -1}u^\\dagger ) \\phi_e . \\label{sflu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding fermionic force is obtained as : @xmath45 with @xmath46 ; @xmath47 .",
    "since no inverse of @xmath40 or @xmath48 appears in this formulation , the overhead in the force calculation is negligible . as shown in fig.[fig : force ] , the fermionic force is reduced by a factor @xmath49 as @xmath50 changes from @xmath51 ( standard even - odd ) to its optimum slightly below @xmath11 . it becomes much smaller than the gauge force .",
    "a sexton - weingarten integration scheme @xcite then allows to take very large fermionic step - sizes .",
    "we tested @xmath52 preconditioning eq.([sflu ] ) on a @xmath53 lattice , at parameters studied by the sesam collaboration ( @xmath54 ) @xcite .",
    "we could increase the fermionic step - size from @xmath55 ( sesam ) to @xmath56 while maintaining a @xmath57 acceptance .",
    "a more extended , though still preliminary test was conducted on an @xmath32 lattice at @xmath58 .",
    "these parameters were chosen in @xcite to compare hmc with the multiboson method , very near criticality .",
    "@xmath52 preconditioning allowed us to increase the fermionic step - size from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . at the same time",
    ", we used a low - accuracy stopping criterion @xmath61 during the trajectory , reducing the number of matrix multiplications per step from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "the autocorrelation time of the plaquette seems unaffected by preconditioning .",
