    "the past twenty years have seen a number of developments that are likely to be relevant to pulsar radio and x - ray emission .",
    "apart from the many improvements in the quality and scope of observations , there has been the recognition of the role of the lense - thirring effect in acceleration at the polar cap ( muslimov & tsygan 1992 ) and of the significance of plasma turbulence ( see the review of melrose 2000 ) .",
    "most of the very many theoretical papers published have assumed a relative orientation of rotation spin @xmath0 and polar - cap magnetic flux density @xmath1 such that @xmath2 with goldreich - julian charge density @xmath3 and electron acceleration . in this case",
    ", there can be no doubt that the electron work function is so small that the space - charge limited flow boundary condition on the corotating - frame electric field , @xmath4 , is satisfied on the polar - cap surface at all instants of time .",
    "( the subscripts @xmath5 and @xmath6 refer to directions locally parallel with and perpendicular to @xmath1 .",
    ") there appears to be no reason why neutron stars with @xmath7 and @xmath8 should not be present in the pulsar population , but in this case , the best existing calculations of ion separation energies ( see medin & lai 2006 ) combined with estimates of the polar - cap temperatures can be used to obtain values of the minimum magnetic field for which the boundary condition @xmath9 is possible .",
    "these are typically of the order of @xmath10 g ( jones 2011 ) and are indirect evidence that all except possibly a very small number of pulsars with spin direction such that @xmath7 satisfy the space - charge limited flow boundary condition rather than the @xmath9 condition assumed in the classic polar - cap model of ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) .",
    "the concept of localized regions of electron - positron pair production , referred to as sparks , moving over the neutron - star surface within the polar cap in an organized way , has been adapted from the ruderman - sutherland model and the @xmath11 boundary condition , but is now widely used phenomenologically , with no reference to boundary conditions or to the sign of @xmath12 , in describing observations such as nulls and subpulse drift . in the @xmath13 case , with space - charge limited flow , no physical basis for such a phenomenological description has so far been published , the reason being that electrons are the only possible negatively - charged particles for outward acceleration and the space - charge limited flow boundary condition @xmath14 can be satisfied at any conceivable polar - cap surface temperature .",
    "the state of the accelerated plasma is then simply a problem in electromagnetism with defined boundary conditions .",
    "however , for @xmath7 , it has been shown that subpulse formation and movement , either organized or disorganized , over the polar - cap surface is quite natural and should be observable in most radio pulsars with this spin direction ( jones 2010a , 2011 ; hereafter papers i and ii ) .",
    "the basis for this conclusion is an examination of the physical processes occurring in electromagnetic showers formed at the polar - cap surface by photo - electrons accelerated inward .",
    "the problem of finding the state of the accelerated plasma is not restricted to electromagnetism but also depends on proton production by the formation and decay of the giant dipole resonance in the electromagnetic showers .",
    "subpulse modulation ( the wide variations of intensity at a fixed longitude in a sequence of observed pulses ) has been recognized as an almost universal property of pulsars ever since their discovery .",
    "weltevrede , edwards & stappers ( 2006 ) found it present in 170 out of a sample of 187 pulsars selected only by signal - to - noise ratio , evidence that its presence is very likely to be independent of the sign of @xmath15 .",
    "strong plasma turbulence is now viewed as the most probable source of radio emission ( see melrose 2000 ) .",
    "its development from a quasi - longitudinal langmuir mode and the possible formation of a random array of stable langmuir solitons has been investigated by asseo , pelletier & sol 1990 , and by asseo & porzio 2006 .",
    "it has been shown recently ( jones 2012 ; hereafter paper iii ) that the formation of this mode is also possible in a two - component beam consisting of protons and relativistic but not ultra - relativistic ions that can be formed as a consequence of the reverse flow of photo - electrons to the polar cap .",
    "thus it is not surprising that subpulse modulation is almost universal . that a secondary low - energy electron - positron plasma is not",
    "the only possible source of plasma turbulence is also consistent with the fact that common characteristics of coherent radio emission are observed in the pulsar population even though the inferred polar - cap magnetic flux densities vary by five orders of magnitude .",
    "pulsars with either sign of @xmath12 are therefore expected to produce individual pulses of similar form although if there is no pair production , there may be differences that are difficult to detect such as in the distributions of spectral index caused by the different plasma frequencies and lorentz factors in the two cases .",
    "but the present paper ( see also paper ii ) proposes that phenomena such as nulls , mode - changes and organized sub - pulse motion are restricted to the @xmath16 case .",
    "these involve time - scales that have no obvious explanation in the @xmath13 direction of spin .",
    "existing observations show that subpulse drift is a frequent though not universal phenomenon .",
    "weltevrede , edwards & stappers found that 68 of their sample of 187 pulsars show observable subpulse drift .",
    "there appears to be no published survey either of nulls or of mode - changes based on a carefully defined sample as in the above work .",
    "but the most recent and largest tabulation of data ( wang , manchester & johnston 2007 ) shows that nulls must be a moderately frequent phenomenon . systematic information about mode - changing is much more sparse ( see kramer et al 2006 ) .",
    "models of subpulse formation and drift recently developed ( see , for example , gil & sendyk 2000 ) are based on the classic paper of ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) and assume the @xmath7 case with the polar - cap surface boundary condition @xmath17 .",
    "these have all the attributes of a good physical model , particularly simplicity and predictive capability in that it is possible to write down an expression for the @xmath18 subpulse drift velocity .",
    "but the boundary condition requires surface magnetic flux densities approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the dipole fields inferred from the spin - down rates .",
    "although the presence of highly complex field geometries formed from higher - multipole components can not be excluded , it would be strange if they were present with the frequency indicated by the survey of weltevrede , edwards & stappers .",
    "consequently , papers i and ii investigated physical processes at the polar - cap surface and have shown that the composition of the plasma accelerated under the space - charge limited flow ( sclf ) boundary condition is usually neither time - independent nor uniform over its whole area .",
    "localized areas in which the accelerated plasma is suitable for the growth of the quasi - longitudinal langmuir mode exist naturally and can move in either an organized or disorganized way , so acting as sources for subpulses with the same properties .",
    "thus plasma systems analogous with ruderman - sutherland sparks are present under the @xmath4 boundary condition .",
    "but we emphasize that their motion is unrelated with @xmath18 drift but is determined by the time @xmath19 in which electromagnetic shower protons diffuse to the surface .",
    "this paper attempts to present a description of the early stages of the coherent emission mechanism that is very different from the canonical .",
    "in particular , the unexpected conclusion of paper iii that relatively low - energy ion and proton beams can be formed means that it is necessary to re - assess the model of sub - pulse drift discussed in paper ii .",
    "polar caps of pulsars with spin @xmath7 are seen to be very complex systems compared with those of the electron acceleration @xmath13 case .",
    "but we must presume that both are present in the neutron - star population and so it is worth examining how the properties of the observed pulsar population may be related with spin direction .    before proceeding further",
    ", it must be admitted that the work has at least one drawback .",
    "processes of the kind considered in papers i and ii , occurring at a continuously changing real condensed - matter surface , are not necessarily susceptible to the formulation of simple physical theories . the behaviour of such systems can be varied and complex . but",
    "this is not inconsistent with the observed properties of many individual pulsars .",
    "section 2 summarizes the assumptions about the properties of the open region of the magnetosphere that we are obliged to make in both qualitative and quantitative work .",
    "strong plasma turbulence is possible only for limited intervals of particle energy at altitudes @xmath20 above the polar - cap surface smaller than @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the neutron - star radius .",
    "this is described in more detail in section 3 .",
    "section 4 draws on the work of paper iii to obtain values of the parameter @xmath23 , which is the number of protons produced by photo - electrons per unit nuclear charge accelerated .",
    "we then give in section 5 a description of the polar cap showing how subpulses are formed and that either chaotic or organized motion is possible .",
    "an attempt is made to show that this model of the polar cap provides a physical basis for phenomena such as nulls , subpulse drift , and mode changes .",
    "at the base of the magnetosphere there is an atmosphere of ions , assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , having a scale height of the order of @xmath24 cm .",
    "its total mass is temperature - dependent but is broadly equivalent to @xmath25 radiation lengths .",
    "thus it contains only the earlier part of the electromagnetic showers formed by the reverse - electron flux .",
    "there is fractionation of the ionic charge to mass ratio .",
    "ions with the highest value are concentrated at the top of the atmosphere and so preferentially enter the acceleration region . the proton number density is many orders of magnitude smaller than that of the ions and consequently has no effect on the structure of the atmosphere .",
    "protons are not in static equilibrium within the lte ion atmosphere but are subject to an outward - directed net gravitational and electrostatic force .",
    "their motion is therefore a combination of diffusion and drift with a characteristic time @xmath19 elapsing between formation and arrival at the top of the atmosphere .",
    "if the rate of formation is such that the goldreich - julian flux would be exceeded , the excess protons form a thin atmosphere in equilibrium at the top of the lte ion atmosphere .",
    "we refer to sections 2 , 3 and 5 of paper ii for a more complete account of these topics .",
    "values @xmath26 s are estimated .",
    "the polar - cap radius adopted here and in paper iii is based on dipole - field geometry and is that given by harding & muslimov ( 2001 ) , @xmath27 for rotation period @xmath28 , in which @xmath29 for the neutron star of mass @xmath30 and radius @xmath31 cm . as in paper iii , we use the fact that the open magnetic flux lines are contained within a narrow tube , assumed to be of circular cross - section whose radius , @xmath32 for a dipole field , increases only very slowly as a function of altitude on the magnetic axis @xmath33 at radii @xmath34 or smaller .",
    "therefore , we can adequately represent a small section of the tube at altitude @xmath20 as a right cylinder of locally - defined radius @xmath35 .",
    "then the electrostatic potential @xmath36 at @xmath37 and under the sclf boundary conditions is approximately @xmath38 in terms of the difference between the charge density @xmath39 and the goldreich - julian charge density @xmath40 which is almost constant over the cross - sectional area of the tube .",
    "we refer again to harding & muslimov ( 2001 ) for these quantities at radial coordinate @xmath41 , @xmath42 and , @xmath43 in which @xmath44 is the surface magnetic flux density .",
    "equation ( 4 ) gives the sclf charge density undisturbed by photo - electric transitions or electron - positron pair creation . in these expressions",
    ", @xmath45 is the dimensionless lense - thirring factor which we assume to be @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the angle between @xmath0 and @xmath48",
    ". equation ( 4 ) also assumes that particle velocities , including those of protons and ions , differ negligibly from the velocity of light .",
    "the function @xmath49 including the red - shift factor @xmath50 is a slowly - varying function of @xmath41 and is approximately unity at low altitudes .",
    "thus @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the flat space - time goldreich - julian charge density .",
    "equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) exclude terms that can become significant at higher altitudes for which our geometrical model also fails , but nevertheless equation ( 2 ) is adequate for the estimation of proton and ion energies and of photo - electric transition rates . it is convenient to use the energy units of particle physics for polar - cap processes and therefore we define a potential energy difference @xmath53 .",
    "it has the value @xmath54 on a flux line with polar - cap coordinate @xmath55 for the undisturbed sclf charge density of equation ( 4 ) .",
    "it is also useful to have a simple expression for @xmath56 on the magnetic axis , @xmath57 for acceleration above the polar cap , where @xmath58 is the surface magnetic flux density in units of @xmath59 g.    the above statement is subject to a serious qualification concerning the definition of the open magnetosphere .",
    "if many secondary low - energy electron - positron pairs were created per primary particle accelerated , there would be no difficulty in assuming the unconstrained outward flow of primary particles and secondary pairs on any magnetic flux line intersecting the light cylinder .",
    "the separate velocity distributions of secondary electrons and positrons would have the capacity to adjust so as to maintain the condition @xmath4 at all points in the open region .",
    "but there must be serious doubts about the universal existence , in the pulsar population , of the necessary density of secondary - pair plasma .",
    "apart from @xmath7 pulsars in which there may be no pair creation , calculations of the secondary pair density produced by the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of polar - cap photons by outward accelerated electrons in the @xmath60 case ( hibschman & arons 2001 ; harding & muslimov 2002 ) predict in many pulsars pair densities that are small compared with unity , per primary electron .",
    "it is true that more complex field geometries , such as the off - set dipole , are possible and may enhance pair production ( see harding & muslimov 2011 ) but there remain at least some hints of a problem in the pair density . in the absence of a pair plasma with the required properties , motion in the magnetosphere beyond the @xmath61 region",
    "depends on the sense of curvature of the open flux line : there is further acceleration for @xmath62 increasing , but deceleration in the opposite case which is capable of cancelling the acceleration at lower altitudes .",
    "a section of the polar cap is then a dead zone from which there is no outward particle flux . whilst the change in active polar - cap shape is not very significant",
    ", the potential given by equation ( 2 ) is reduced , very roughly , in proportion to the decrease in area .",
    "the component @xmath63 in the dead volume is very small and is that required to maintain a charge - separated equilibrium with gravity and the centrifugal force .",
    "a further source of uncertainty is the consistency with which the total electric charge of the neutron star remains constant .",
    "the rate of loss of charge at the polar caps is @xmath64 whose compensation is likely to be easy if there is strong secondary pair creation , but is otherwise obscure .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of the relevant time - scale can be found by dividing a typical light - cylinder field strength by the rate of change of the light - cylinder radial electric field given by @xmath65 .",
    "this is , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the light - cylinder radius .",
    "this indicates that if there is to be no substantial change in the structure of the magnetosphere , cessation of the processes maintaining charge constancy is possible only for time intervals no more than of the order of @xmath28 .",
    "but the great uncertainty affecting @xmath7 pulsars is in the atomic number of matter at the neutron - star surface .",
    "if this were small @xmath68 there would be a negligible reverse - electron flux and , as we shall see in section 3 , no coherent radio emission unless curvature radiation electron - positron pair production is possible .",
    "there is some indirect observational evidence for @xmath69 ( ho & heinke 2009 ; see also bogdanov & grindlay 2009 , yakovlev et al 2011 , and zhu et al 2009 ) but it does not appear strong .",
    "theoretical work does indicate the possibility of atomic numbers other than the canonical @xmath70 .",
    "calculations by hoffman & heyl ( 2009 ) for isolated neutron stars with no mass accretion show the presence of @xmath71 , though with small total mass , but pearson , goriely & chamel ( 2011 ) find a range of values @xmath72",
    ". the mass per unit area removed by a goldreich - julian current density of nuclei with mass number @xmath73 in an @xmath7 pulsar in a life - time @xmath74 is , @xmath75 assuming that @xmath44 and @xmath47 are time - independent .",
    "this is @xmath76 g @xmath77 at @xmath78 yr , and over the whole surface of the star amounts to a layer of no more than @xmath79 @xmath80 .",
    "it is a quantity that could easily be the result of unknown details of the formation process such as fall - back . in view of this , direct experimental evidence of the nuclei that are actually present at the polar - cap surface is clearly needed .",
    "the uncertainty in the atomic number of polar - cap surface nuclei has an obvious effect on photo - electric transitions , and therefore on the reverse - electron flux and the acceleration potential difference for particles moving on any given magnetic flux line .",
    "the dependence of @xmath36 on @xmath81 in equation ( 2 ) means that the production of oppositely charged particles in a charge - separated region at altitude @xmath20 under the sclf boundary condition tends to cancel the local electric field @xmath63 .",
    "this is well - known in the case of electron - positron pairs but is , of course , also true for photo - electrons ( see paper iii ) .",
    "equation ( 2 ) is not valid at low altitudes @xmath82 . near the polar - cap surface , @xmath83",
    ", @xmath63 is the inertial acceleration field first described by michel ( 1974 ) .",
    "the problem of finding the electric field is one - dimensional in @xmath20 and the inertial @xmath63 is not large .",
    "its contribution to particle acceleration is small compared with that of the muslimov - tsygan effect .",
    "we refer to paper iii for an approximate model for this region .",
    "the polar - cap and whole - surface neutron - star temperatures are treated as distinct in paper iii and in the present work .",
    "calculated photo - electric transition rates for polar - cap blackbody photons are negligibly small above an altitude @xmath84 , principally because the photon momentum component perpendicular to @xmath1 becomes small at higher altitudes .",
    "this is unfavourable both for the lorentz transformation to the rest - frame of the accelerated ion and for the cross - section to the lowest landau state of the emitted electron ( see paper iii ) .",
    "the sclf boundary conditions lead to an electric field having a complex form in the @xmath85 region which is unlikely to be well represented by equation ( 2 ) .",
    "there also exist the complications , just discussed , of the inertial @xmath63 and of photo - electric transitions in this interval .",
    "but the boundary conditions also limit the extent to which @xmath81 can change if the condition @xmath86 is to be satisfied .",
    "thus the difference between the mean ion charges @xmath87 at @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the assumed local thermodynamic equilibrium of the atmosphere at @xmath90 can not be large .",
    "adjustments in @xmath81 and in @xmath63 maintain this state by limiting ion lorentz factors and hence photo - electric transition rates .",
    "the ratio , @xmath91 including ion , proton and electron charge densities is always very nearly unity at @xmath92 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the mean number of protons produced in electromagnetic showers per unit nuclear charge accelerated .",
    "the mean charge of nuclei reaching the surface after moving through the electromagnetic shower region is @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is the ion charge at @xmath95 , where photo - electric transition rates become negligibly small . because the acceleration in this interval is minor compared with that at @xmath96 we can assume that the effect of this region is to inject ions of mean charge @xmath87 and lorentz factor @xmath97 into the main acceleration region @xmath96 in which @xmath81 is modified by photo - electric transitions and possibly by electron - positron pair creation . although the mean value of @xmath98 is small , it is undoubtedly finite , and the associated reverse - electron flux gives a modest energy input , @xmath99 , to the polar - cap surface even in the absence of any whole - surface contribution to photo - ionization at @xmath96 .",
    "we refer to paper iii for its approximate size , @xmath100 gev .    for a relatively small fraction of pulsars ,",
    "pair creation by the conversion of curvature radiation ( cr ) photons is possible .",
    "but for most @xmath101 pulsars , it is believed that the source of pairs is the conversion of outward - directed ics polar - cap photons ( see hibschman & arons 2001 , harding & muslimov 2002 ) . however , in the case of the @xmath7 pulsars considered here , there is an essential difference in that the electron - photon momentum in the frame of the rotating neutron star is directed inwards .",
    "there is likely to be some pair creation at low values of @xmath20 from @xmath102-rays emitted by the capture of shower - generated neutrons at the polar - cap surface , but the rate is difficult to estimate .",
    "thus pair creation rates in most @xmath7 pulsars are likely to be one or two orders of magnitude smaller than for those with spin direction @xmath13 .",
    "but even for the latter spin direction , the number of ics pairs formed per primary electron can be much smaller than unity ( see harding & muslimov 2002 , also fig .",
    "8 of hibschman & arons ) .",
    "thus for the @xmath7 spin direction , there is a very real problem in understanding how a density of low - energy secondary electron - positron pairs adequate for coherent radio emission can be formed .",
    "there is now a consensus that , in almost all observable radio pulsars , the source of the coherent emission lies within radii @xmath103 and its energy is derived from particle acceleration at the polar cap .",
    "there is also a growing consensus that the formation of strong plasma turbulence is involved ( melrose 2000 ) .",
    "the unstable mode that develops into strong plasma turbulence and transfers energy from particle beams to the electromagnetic field must therefore have a high growth rate .",
    "this severely constrains the energy of the beam particles .",
    "the equations of motion for the system are the maxwell equations and those for a relativistic particle fluid . in a strong magnetic field ,",
    "the mass - to - charge ratio present in the equations is @xmath104 for particles of species @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the charge and @xmath107 the lorentz factor .",
    "the longitudinal effective mass is @xmath108 and this factor necessarily determines the growth rate of any unstable mode .",
    "we consider in this paper , specifically , the growth of a quasi - longitudinal langmuir mode ( asseo , pelletier & sol 1990 ) from which a random array of stable langmuir solitons may develop ( asseo & porzio 2006 ) .",
    "a different longitudinal mode has been studied by weatherall ( 1997 , 1998 ) and may be the source of the nanosecond pulses observed in certain pulsars ( hankins et al 2003 ; soglasnov et al 2004 ) .",
    "( we refer to the paper of asseo & porzio for an account of the history of plasma turbulence in relation to pulsar physics . ) the langmuir mode and solitons have components @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 perpendicular to @xmath112 and so can transfer energy to the radiation field directly ( see asseo , pelletier & sol 1990 ) . hence the direct transfer of energy to the radiation field",
    "is determined only by the longitudinal effective mass and by the departure of the mode wave - vector from the purely longitudinal state .",
    "examination of growth rates shows at once that primary electrons or positrons of @xmath113 gev energy have longitudinal effective masses so large that they are unable to participate in the mode .",
    "the beams that interact in @xmath13 pulsars can be only secondary electrons and positrons whose velocity distributions satisfy the relativistic penrose condition ( buschauer & benford 1977 ) . but ion and proton beams that have longitudinal effective masses of the same order as secondary electrons and positrons can be produced in @xmath7 neutron stars .",
    "thus it is anticipated that pulsars of both directions exist and produce very similar coherent emission .",
    "beams of cold ions and protons ( or , hypothetically , cold electrons and positrons ) permit growth of the quasi - longitudinal langmuir mode for which the dispersion relation is , @xmath114 for angular frequency @xmath115 , wave - vector @xmath116 , and ion and proton ( or , electron and positron ) velocities @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "the remaining quantities are @xmath119 in which , @xmath120 where @xmath106 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are respectively the charge , mass and neutron - star frame number density of each component @xmath123 . the transverse field components are , @xmath124 the plasma frequency in the rest frame of a component is @xmath125 and so , following asseo et al , a natural wavenumber for which to seek a solution is defined in terms of the slower - moving component , and is @xmath126 . with the definition of a new variable @xmath127 such that , @xmath128 and , @xmath129 valid for @xmath130 equation ( 8) can be expressed as , @xmath131 in which @xmath132 and @xmath133 . in the limit @xmath134 , equation ( 13 ) is a quartic with two real and two complex roots , whose properties were investigated in paper iii .",
    "the amplitude growth rate was found to be of the order of @xmath135 and is a slowly varying function of the ratio @xmath136 and , for ions , the proton - ion number density ratio .",
    "but we have to consider the quasi - longitudinal case of @xmath137 in which the transverse field components are non - zero .",
    "equation ( 13 ) is then less transparent , being a quintic with three real and two complex roots , but we can use perturbation theory to estimate the extent to which a non - zero @xmath138 changes a given complex root . let @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is a root of the quartic .",
    "then , @xmath141 from equations ( 10 ) , we see that @xmath142 for @xmath143 . then for typical values of @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath140",
    ", we have , @xmath146 indicating that for a significant range of @xmath138 , the growth rate does not differ much from the @xmath147 value .",
    "the growth rate decreases with distance above the polar cap and so it is appropriate to obtain the amplitude growth factor @xmath148 at a given radius @xmath149 by integration .",
    "it is , @xmath150 assuming a dipole field and constant @xmath151 . here",
    ", the ion ( or electron ) component number density in the frame of the rotating neutron star is a fraction @xmath152 of the goldreich - julian number density . for @xmath153 and @xmath154 ,",
    "the factor is , @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the electron rest mass .",
    "we can see that the growth factor increases most rapidly at small @xmath41 and is substantially developed at @xmath157 .",
    "the only particle property that it depends on is the charge to longitudinal effective mass ratio . a minimum value necessary for the development of nonlinearity is presumably given by the size of particle number fluctuations within a cubic - wavelength volume at the goldreich - julian number density .",
    "this indicates a minimum @xmath158 .",
    "we assume @xmath159 . for a typical pulsar with @xmath160 , equation ( 17 )",
    "then requires @xmath161 for electrons or @xmath162 for ion beams at @xmath157 increasing to @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively , at @xmath165 .",
    "development of turbulence or of stable solitons is then possible for either electrons or ions although for electrons , the cold beam hypothesis is clearly unrealistic and the distributions of electron and positron velocities must satisfy the penrose condition .",
    "quasi - longitudinal modes transfer energy directly to the radiation field at angular frequencies of the order of @xmath166 .",
    "the actual maximum in the intensity distribution presumably depends on the extent to which developed turbulence moves energy toward higher wavenumbers .",
    "this is unknown except that some examples of soliton formation considered by asseo & porzio have maxima at @xmath167 . as a function of @xmath41 and for @xmath154 , the frequencies @xmath168 are , @xmath169 respectively , for electrons and for ions of mass number @xmath73 and charge @xmath94 .",
    "these values differ by two orders of magnitude and suggest the existence of two classes of pulsar with very different radiation spectra though with individual pulses of similar form .",
    "there have been relatively few measurements of flux density below 400 mhz but those of deshpande & radhakrishnan ( 1992 ) and of malofeev et al ( 1994 ) both confirm that low - frequency spectral cut - offs are usually below @xmath170 mhz and in some cases , below @xmath171 mhz .",
    "there have been many calculations of pair formation densities above polar caps , but of particular interest is the paper of harding & muslimov ( 2011 ) who have studied the effect of a specific type of field , that of an off - set dipole .",
    "pair formation densities , assuming outward moving ics photons to be the source , are rapidly increasing functions of the degree of off - set .",

    "such a solution would be time - independent and of uniform @xmath39 over the polar cap , with both ion and proton components .",

    "ion lorentz factors @xmath236 and proton energies @xmath237 gev are possible on flux lines originating near the edge of the polar cap .",
    "however , in the more general case , large values of @xmath197 in the uniform time - independent model lead to @xmath238 and hence to instability , as shown in section 4.3 of paper i. the actual state of the polar - cap surface is therefore time - dependent .",
    "the basic principle is that the state of any element @xmath239 of surface at any instant is a function only of its past time - distribution of reverse - electron energy flux .",

    "most protons are produced in the vicinity of the shower maximum whose depth is only a slowly varying function of the primary electron energy .",
    "their motion toward the surface is better described by a drift velocity , rather than diffusion , in most of the lte atmosphere so that the distribution of arrival times can be modelled as @xmath246 .",
    "we refer to section 5 of paper ii for further details . following paper iii , equation ( 20 )",
    "recognizes that @xmath23 is a function of @xmath185 and @xmath74 owing to its @xmath247dependence , and can vary on time - scales of the order of @xmath19",
    ". the protons are preferentially accelerated , but if @xmath244 reaches the goldreich - julian flux , as can be the case if @xmath238 , a thin proton atmosphere forms at the top of the ion atmosphere at a rate given by @xmath248 and the local ion flux falls to zero until it is exhausted .",
    "as a first approximation , equation ( 20 ) shows that the condition of an element of polar - cap area can be represented by two possible states : ion emission with duration @xmath19 or proton emission of duration @xmath249 , where @xmath211 is here the time - average over the interval @xmath19 .",
    "values @xmath250 ensure that proton production is so large that an atmosphere of protons forms at the top of the lte atmosphere of ions .",
    "then the ion phase ends and the proton phase is maintained until the proton component of the atmosphere is exhausted .",
    "areas in the ion phase necessarily move with time and so can be seen as moving subpulses within the time - averaged radio - pulse profile",
    ". the motion could be chaotic or , as proposed in paper ii , organized so as to give regular subpulse drift .",
    "pair creation by curvature radiation ( cr ) photons was referred to briefly at the end of section 2 but has been otherwise ignored here .",
    "the necessary conditions are thought to be present in a relatively small fraction of the observed population ( harding & muslimov 2002 ) but we shall review briefly its effects in the @xmath251 case with sclf boundary conditions .",
    "self - sustaining pair creation requires adequate conversion probabilities for both outward and inward - directed cr photons at @xmath252 .",
    "thus pair creation is not uniform over the whole cross - sectional area @xmath253 of the open flux tube , but depends on a combination of @xmath230 and of flux - line curvature . for the suitable values of @xmath55 , the equation analogous to ( 19 ) , obtained by comparison of current densities at @xmath254 and @xmath255 , can be most compactly expressed in terms of the particle flux @xmath256 on the relevant flux lines , @xmath257 in which @xmath258 is the flux either of electrons or positrons , and @xmath259 is the proton flux .",
    "this assumes , as is almost certainly the case , that the reverse - electron energy flux produces an excess of protons at the top of the lte atmosphere .",
    "there is then no ion flow except on flux lines that do not satisfy the cr criteria such as those near @xmath260 on which @xmath56 is too small .",
    ".values of the mean reverse - electron energy per ion ( @xmath197 ) at the polar - cap surface in units of gev , and of the mean ion charge at the end of photo - ionization ( @xmath94 ) have been calculated .",

    "we refer to section 4 for discussion of @xmath93 and other parameters on which the calculated values are dependent .",
    "the final three pairs of columns give the values of @xmath197 and of @xmath94 for whole surface temperatures @xmath261 and @xmath262 k. the rotation period is @xmath199 s. blank spaces denote energies that are negligibly small .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     quantitative model construction is not attempted here .",
    "owing to the uncertainties in significant parameters that are listed in section 6 , quantitative testing of a model against observed data does not appear immediately profitable .",
    "the purpose of this paper is less ambitious .",
    "it is an attempt to show that the condition of the polar - cap surface provides a physical basis for nulls , mode - switches and subpulse drift . to do this",
    ", we describe qualitatively some of the possible polar - cap states .",
    "assume , initially , that cr pair production as described above is possible over some limited area of the polar cap . its boundary can be defined as that within which proton production by the reverse - electrons of cr pairs exceeds the goldreich - julian rate so that a proton atmosphere forms and grows in density . between this boundary and @xmath263",
    "there is an annular strip within which ion acceleration can occur and proton formation is governed by equation ( 20 ) .",
    "( any contribution from cr reverse - electrons is neglected here . )",
    "solutions of equation ( 20 ) then exist in which zones of ion phase circulate around the cr region .",
    "equation ( 20 ) is local in @xmath185 and so can not itself determine the circulation sense or velocity .",
    "suppose that there are @xmath264 ion zones .",
    "then in the usual notation by which subpulse drift is described , the circulation time is @xmath265 , where @xmath266 is the band separation and in the model is given by @xmath267 .",
    "association with subpulse drift would require either secondary pair creation on the ion phase flux lines or the presence of proton and ion components in the current density near to @xmath268 so that energies are low enough for langmuir - mode growth .",
    "a further consideration is that excess proton production within the cr area must be accompanied by lateral diffusion on the polar - cap surface , perpendicular to @xmath1 .",
    "we have chosen the example of a clearly defined annular region but there is no reason why organized motion of this kind should not occur more generally and in the absence of a cr component .",
    "a further possibility is that the active cr region could be switched off by changes in the potential inside it which is also dependent on the state of the remaining parts of the polar cap . in general , in a less - organized state , there is no reason why either the whole polar cap or large parts of it should not be in the proton phase for intervals of time of the order of @xmath269 and , in the absence of cr pair production , there would be no possibility of langmuir mode growth .",
    "thus nulls are a natural phenomenon within the model .",
    "obviously , there are many possible polar - cap states , their relevance to widely - observed phenomena being limited only by the requirement that they should not be too dependent on neutron - star parameters having critical or particular values .",
    "mode - changes have been studied extensively in a small number of pulsars , some of which also exhibit subpulse drift .",
    "the paper of bartel et al ( 1982 ) summarizes the main characteristics of this phenomenon .",
    "these authors emphasize that the spectral and polarization changes that occur on mode - switching are consistent with a change in the optical depth of the source region within the magnetosphere and that the sources of the two or more modes would be on different sets of flux lines .",
    "( they also suggest that the explanation of mode - switching lies in the polar - cap surface , though in the context of the ruderman & sutherland model . )",
    "switching of emission between different sets of flux lines occurs naturally in our qualitative model which is sufficiently diverse to accommodate the characteristics of mode - switching that are observed , including changes in subpulse drift rates .",
    "the qualitative model is applicable to subpulse drift and to short - duration nulls or mode changes and there is no difficulty in understanding how non - randomness or quasi - periodicity , such as that reported by rankin & wright ( 2008 ) and redman & rankin ( 2009 ) might occur naturally in such a system .",
    "the time - scales are necessarily short , perhaps of the order of @xmath269 , but there is also the possibility of a medium time - scale instability in the atomic number @xmath93 of surface nuclei , described in section 4 of paper ii .",
    "this can result in values of @xmath93 that are too small to produce any reverse - electron flux because the atoms are completely ionized in the lte atmosphere .",
    "having the largest charge - to - mass ratio , apart from protons , they are in equilibrium at the top of the atmosphere and so are preferentially accelerated through the full potential difference @xmath228 with no possibility of langmuir - mode growth if cr pair creation is not possible .",
    "a broad measure of the time - scale for this instability is provided by the time in which a depth of surface nuclei equivalent to one radiation length is removed from the polar cap at the goldreich - julian current density . from equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) of paper i , this is given by , @xmath270 the distribution of @xmath93 over the polar cap at any instant need not , and probably will not , be uniform .",
    "thus complex distributions of potential and of accelerated beam composition are to be expected .",
    "both neutron - star spin directions , defined by the sign of @xmath12 at the polar caps , presumably exist and it is one of the purposes of this paper to question how , if at all , each sign contributes to the observed radio pulsar population .",
    "previous papers ( i - iii ) have been directed toward the @xmath7 case because it has positive polar - cap corotational charge density so that the flux of accelerated particles can have ionic , proton and positron components .",
    "there appears to have been some reluctance in the published literature to consider in any detail the physics of the polar cap for this spin direction .",
    "but papers i - iii have attempted to show that such considerations are essential and that the radio emission characteristics are not solely determined by electrodynamics , as may be so for @xmath271 .",
    "weltevrede , edwards & stappers ( 2006 ) detected subpulse drift in almost one half of a sample of @xmath272 pulsars selected only by signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "nulls and mode changes are less frequently observed .",
    "we propose that results obtained in papers i - iii and in the present paper lead to the idea that these phenomena are all related to the physics of the polar cap in @xmath7 pulsars and that the opposite spin direction , with only electrons as primary accelerated particles , is then observed as the population showing subpulse modulation , perhaps as a consequence of plasma turbulence , but none of the above phenomena .",
    "the problem with polar - cap physics is that a real condensed - matter system can be extremely complex and , as we noted in section 1 , does not always lend itself to the construction of simple models ( see also section 2 of paper ii ) .",
    "a further difficulty is that some of the parameters concerned are either unknown , such as the atomic number of surface nuclei , or can vary over several orders of magnitude .",
    "calculated values in table 1 are limited to @xmath273 g which is representative of pulsars in the nulls tabulation of wang et al ( 2007 ) and , for example , of those pulsars with drifting subpulses investigated by gil et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "photo - electric cross - sections obtained in paper iii are not valid at @xmath274 g in which region interpolation between zero - field cross - sections and those at @xmath59 g would be necessary . at higher fields , @xmath275 g , approximate cross - sections for bremsstrahlung and pair creation have been found ( jones 2010b ) and electromagnetic shower development investigated .",
    "it was confirmed that the value of the proton production parameter @xmath276 decreases only slowly at @xmath277 but also that the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect , known to exist in zero field , is significant in the neutron - star atmosphere , and has the effect of reducing high - energy bremsstrahlung and pair creation cross - sections and therefore of increasing shower depth and hence the proton diffusion - drift time @xmath19 .",
    "the whole - surface temperature @xmath224 is a further important parameter that is not well known .",
    "paper iii did not incorporate general - relativistic corrections that should strictly have been made in transforming the blackbody radiation field to the ion rest frame .",
    "but for most transitions , the radiation field is better approximated by that of the neutron - star surface proper frame rather than by @xmath278 , the temperature inferred by a distant observer . since @xmath279 for the neutron - star mass and radius assumed here in section 2 , the temperatures used in table 1 are well below those that can presently be observed .",
    "yakovlev & pethick ( 2004 ) list only a small number of young pulsars whose blackbody temperatures have been measured .",
    "these are @xmath280 k. all model predictions reviewed by these authors show @xmath281 decreasing very rapidly at age @xmath282 yr .",
    "but on the other hand , temperatures below @xmath225 k , the lowest used in table 1 , could be maintained by a very small and obscure level of dissipation within the star .",
    "isolated neutron stars ( ins ) certainly have higher temperatures @xmath283 k ( see , for example , kaplan & van kerkwijk 2009 ) .",
    "but they are few in number and their radio beams ( if they exist ) would be narrow compared with the @xmath284 observability of unpulsed blackbody radiation . given this uncertainty , we do not regard them as part of the population considered here .    the energy of the coherent radio emission must presumably be transferred from particle beams in high magnetic field regions near the polar caps . whatever the coherent emission mechanism is eventually established to be ,",
    "provided it is not curvature radiation , the criteria in section 3 for growth of langmuir modes must be relevant .",
    "this paper does not attempt to judge whether low - energy secondary electrons or small lorentz factor ions form the particle beams producing radio emission in any particular group , but asserts that both possibilities exist for @xmath7 pulsars .",
    "it follows that evolution of a pulsar to old age may include long intervals , perhaps of the order of @xmath285 yr , in which pair creation is not possible because @xmath56 is too small but ion lorentz factors remain too large to give adequate langmuir - mode growth rates . because @xmath286 , at least approximately , the highest growth rates will be on flux lines with @xmath287 near @xmath260 .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the conal pattern of emission in the pulsar morphology developed by rankin ( 1983 ) .",
    "pulsars exhibit nulls with mean duration as short as several rotation periods or , for those described as intermittent pulsars , times of the order of @xmath288 d. psr 1931 + 24 is an example of the latter ( kramer et al 2006 ) , but long - duration nulls have now also been observed in j1832 + 0029 ( see lyne 2009 ) and in j1841 - 0500 ( camilo et al 2012 ) .",
    "such null durations allow separate measurement of the spin - down rate in both on and off - states of emission . in each case , the off - state spin - down rate is about half that of the on - state , indicating some substantial difference in the condition of the magnetosphere . obviously , it is not known if this is also true for short - duration nulls but for @xmath7 pulsars in our model of the polar cap , it occurs naturally owing to the change in the extent to which the electromagnetic fields near and beyond the light cylinder are loaded and the total momentum density modified by particle emission .",
    "if the whole polar cap were in the proton phase , as discussed in section 5 , there would be no significant pair creation ( assuming no cr pair production ) and , of course , no possibility of langmuir - mode growth .",
    "however , if creation of low - energy secondary pairs were possible , the flux of particles to be accelerated at or beyond the light cylinder could greatly exceed the goldreich - julian value .",
    "even though we lack a comprehensive understanding of acceleration at @xmath67 and beyond , it is entirely plausible that the changes in particle number density inherent in our model would lead to the observed changes in spin - down torque .",
    "interesting reviews of pulsars with large nulling fractions and of the rotating radio transients ( rrat ) have been given recently by burke - spolaor & bailes ( 2010 ) , keane et al ( 2011 ) and by keane & mclaughlin ( 2011 ) .",
    "in particular , pulsars are shown in the @xmath289 plane , where @xmath290 is here the fraction of periods in which a pulse is detected .",
    "the distribution appears roughly uniform in @xmath291 within the interval @xmath292 .",
    "the existence of these objects is not inconsistent with the complexity of possible polar - cap states of the @xmath7 pulsars described here given the time - scale @xmath293 defined by equation ( 22 ) . but keane & mclaughlin note that there is a scarcity of objects whose behaviour is governed by time - scales that are longer than the above but shorter than the very long time - scales ( @xmath294 s ) associated with the intermittent pulsars such as psr 1931 + 24 .",
    "very long time - scales much exceeding those given by equation ( 22 ) still remain a problem whose explanation may be more subtle than those attempted in this paper or may lie in quite different considerations .",
    "a simple explanation for the rrat has been proposed by weltevrede et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "these authors compared rrat pulses with the infrequent very large - amplitude pulses seen in psr 0656 + 14 .",
    "they note that if 0656 + 14 were as distant in the galaxy as most of the rrat , its observed emission would appear to be that of the typical rrat . but this may be inconsistent with the periodicities in individual rrat pulse arrival times found recently by palliyaguru et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "these are mostly of the order of @xmath295 s but a minority are much longer , of the order of @xmath296 s. if these complex sets of periodicities are established and are not loose quasi - periodicities , they represent a very real problem for the model of the polar cap described here .",
    "it is difficult to see how they can be present in a truly isolated neutron star , with either spin direction , not interacting with any other periodic system .",
    "quasi - periodicities might be understandable in terms of natural phenomena at the condensed - matter surface , possibly connected with the diffusion of low-@xmath93 nuclei perpendicular to @xmath1 in the vicinity of the polar cap or with the two sections of the open magnetosphere described in section 2 .",
    "but well - defined periodicities would remain a problem .",

    "<S> little attention has so far been paid to the division of the observed population between pulsars of the two spin directions that are possible . </S>",
    "<S> almost all pulsars with positive corotational charge density at the polar caps are expected to satisfy space - charge limited flow boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> charge separation by blackbody photo - electric transitions in moving ions limits the acceleration potential , analogously with the more usually considered pair creation . </S>",
    "<S> but the limitation is more severe so that proton and ion energies can be relativistic but not ultra - relativistic , and these allow the growth of langmuir - mode induced turbulence that couples directly with the radiation field , as shown by asseo , pelletier & sol . </S>",
    "<S> the consequences of this , and of the several possible physical states of the polar cap , are described , qualitatively , as possible explanations for the complex phenomena of nulls , subpulse drift and mode - switching observed in sub - sets of pulsars .    </S>",
