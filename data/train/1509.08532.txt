    "entangled polymer melts display unique dynamical properties as the time scales of diffusion and viscosity change several orders of magnitude with increasing degree of polymerization .",
    "more specifically , the scaling exponents that define the dynamics , diffusion and viscosity , as a function of the degree of polymerization , @xmath1 , are different for short and for long chains . in long chains the dynamics",
    "is dominated by the presence of entanglements , transient points of contact between chains , due to the impossibility of chains to cross through each other.@xcite such entanglements limit chain diffusion and , for a large number of entanglements per chain , experiment shows that diffusion occurs mainly along the direction of the curvature of the chain in a motion reminiscent of the slithering of a snake , i.e. the so - called  reptation \" dynamics.@xcite in liquids of short chains , however , the number of entanglements per chain is small , chain diffusion is fast , and the entanglements are short lived , so that their presence does not affect the motion of the chain .",
    "the rouse model accurately represents the dynamics of melts of short chains through a langevin approach that describes the time evolution of the coordinates of the monomers in a macromolecular chain .",
    "however the model does not account for the constraints due to the presence of entanglements as it represents the polymers as phantom chains free of crossing each other .",
    "the chain in the rouse model is , interestingly , fully flexible and infinitely long , to the point that the approximation of a continuum description becomes correct , but not entangled.@xcite the implementation of the rouse model to treat chains of finite length and with local semi - flexibility improves the agreement with experimental data.@xcite including the intermolecular interactions and the dynamical slowing down of the center - of - mass in the rouse model provides quantitative agreement for the sub - diffusive dynamics of polymer center - of - mass mean - square displacement.@xcite    the dynamics of long chains in a melt is traditionally described by thereptation \" model , where the fluid relaxation is due to the diffusion of a chain outside of the effective  tube `` formed by the presence of entanglements .",
    "the phenomenological reptation model was first described by de gennes and subsequently formalized by doi and edwards.@xcite in an effort to improve the agreement between theory and experiment , several extensions to the reptation model have been developed over the following years .",
    "it was observed that the original reptation model works fairly well in the ' ' fully - entangled \" regime , where the linear chains have a high degree of polymerization and the constraint of entanglements is long lasting .",
    "however , it provides limited agreement with experiments for weakly entangled chains where it is difficult to define an effective  tube `` . in that regime",
    "the original reptation model has to be modified to account for mechanisms of relaxation other then escape from the tube constraint , which are found to greatly improve the agreement of the theory with experiments .",
    "contour length fluctuations , constraint release , and tube dilation have been introduced with the motivation that the ' ' tube `` is formed by the chains surrounding the ' ' tagged \" chain and , if the polymers are short enough , both the interchain contacts and the effective tube evolve in time because the molecules diffuse away from each other.@xcite    a detailed discussion of the different implementations of the reptation model can be found in recent review articles.@xcite in general it is observed that when these models are adopted , the agreement between the reptation theory and the experiments is greatly improved .",
    "however , it is also seen that models optimized to reproduce , for example , scattering data could hardly agree with data measured otherwise , such as in dynamical mechanical experiments , or in simulations.@xcite furthermore , recent experiments in the non - linear dynamical regime , which have been recently confirmed by simulations , have suggested that the reptation model incorrectly explains the physics of the observed stress overshoot during high - rate startup shear.@xcite    a recent reptation - like approach has been presented by likhtman and coworkers , which involves a simple description of entanglements as harmonic springs connected to a static support , mimicking the confinement of reptation.@xcite this so - called `` slip - link '' model describes the constrained dynamics of the entangled chains and their anisotropic chain diffusion . the model is an extension of rubinstein s original approach,@xcite and has proven quite successful in describing numerous aspects of entangled polymer dynamics .",
    "the approach is still phenomenological .",
    "it has been further extended by depablo and others to include springs between pairs of interacting chains and thus ensure momentum conservation.@xcite an earlier version of the slip - link model was presented by schiber and coworkers.@xcite another slip - link model of more recent construction was implemented in the new algorithm for polymeric liquids entangled and strained ( naples ) , by marrucci , watanabe , and coworkers.@xcite    while `` reptation - like '' approaches in general have been successful in predicting characteristic scaling exponents that agree with experimentally observed physical behavior , these models are limited when it is necessary to establish a direct connection between the chemical structure of the polymer , at defined thermodynamic conditions , and the measured dynamics.@xcite quantities such as the entanglement degree of polymerization , the tube diameter , and the plateau modulus are not unequivocally defined on the basis of the polymeric structure and semi - flexibility .",
    "it is hard to predict dynamical behavior of a newly synthesized polymer , at given thermodynamic conditions , within the reptation formalism .",
    "furthermore , none of the implementations of the reptation model or the model itself can be used to explain experimental data of the dynamics for short , unentangled systems .",
    "this is a consequence of the phenomenological character of the reptation model , which is not general built on a first - principles formalism , and so it can not be easily implemented to treat more complex systems .",
    "it seems clear that the development of microscopic theories for entangled dynamics could be a necessary step to alleviate this problem .",
    "the question is , then , about which kind of microscopic formalism should be adopted .",
    "some considerations could help address this question .",
    "\\1 ) although the concept of entanglements is quite intuitive , a microscopic theory of entanglements and their effect on polymer dynamics is difficult to formalize because entanglements are essentially a many - body problem .",
    "recent experiments@xcite and simulations@xcite have shown that the main effect of entanglements is the confinement of the chain dynamics to a primitive path , in agreement with the original model by doi and edwards.@xcite from the general point of view , this finding supports the traditional picture of a polymer confined by the presence of entanglements into moving inside a `` tube '' and explains the success of the reptation model . however",
    ", the experimental studies also show that the physics of entanglements is more complex than the simple  tube `` picture of the reptation models .",
    "the ' ' tube \" is not a static structure , but is dynamic in nature , and a more microscopic approach to entanglements has to be developed.@xcite    \\2 ) the lack of flexibility of the reptation model when applied to different experimental conditions ( temperature , density , polymer degree of semiflexibility , concentration ) arises from its mean - field character , the single chain is treated explicitly but the surrounding chains are described in an approximated way as a  confining tube \" . in reality , entanglements involve local persistent contact _ between monomers belonging to different chains _ and a more effective representation of the key components in this process should involve the dynamics of at least a pair of polymers . accounting for entanglements as interacting chains",
    "was the motivation behind previous approaches , including the double reptation model by des cloizeaux@xcite and the dynamics of two entangled stiff polymers by szamel.@xcite by formalizing a theory of the dynamics for entangled polymers with explicit intra- and inter - molecular potentials , the effect of the thermodynamics on the dynamics can be properly accounted for , as we show in this paper.@xcite    \\3 ) up to now , different equations have to be used to describe the motion of a polymeric liquid with increasing chain length because the rouse equation and the  reptation \" model are formally incompatible theories .",
    "interestingly , neither the thermodynamics nor the structural properties of the polymeric liquid show any discontinuity at the transition from unentangled to entangled dynamics , indicating that the microscopic formalism expressed at the level of the forces should be identical in the two regimes .",
    "it is reasonable to argue that with increasing chain length different physical phenomena emerge , which are always present in the polymeric liquid , but whose relative relevance changes going from short to long chains .",
    "this observation implies that it should be possible to develop one theoretical formalism that properly represents the change in the balance of the forces acting on the polymer at the transition between the two dynamical regimes and which well represents the dynamics in both regimes .",
    "more specifically , while entanglements are always present , in the case of short chains their number per chain is small and their effect on the dynamics should be negligible because the chains can inter - diffuse faster than they experience the physical constraint of entanglements . in long chains , instead",
    ", the entanglements dominate the dynamics because the number of entanglements per chain is larger , chain inter - diffusion becomes increasingly slow with increasing degree of polymerization , and chains are not able to disentangle rapidly enough .",
    "\\4 ) from a physical perspective both unentangled and entangled polymer melts are complex fluids at low reynolds number , i.e. they are overdamped systems.@xcite the microscopic formalism that properly represents their dynamics is a langevin - type of equation in the coordinates of the monomeric unit or the equivalent description of the fokker - plank - smoluchowski equation.@xcite a langevin equation that properly represents the balance of the different inter- and intra - molecular forces playing a role in the polymer melt should provide a good description of the dynamics of the system and good agreement with the different types of experimental data , in the full range of the variable degree of polymerization .",
    "other generalized langevin equations were developed in the past to describe entangled dynamics , where the slowing down due to entanglements was formulated through the perturbative solution of the memory function.@xcite the approach we follow goes towards a different direction based on the consideration that , in the cases in which it is possible to include a proper description of all the relevant forces that act on the system in the linear part of the langevin equation , this procedure de facto minimizes the correction due to the memory function and the latter can be conveniently discarded . because the solution of the memory function requires the simplification of four - point distribution functions into a combination of two - point distribution functions , which is necessarily approximated , having the relevant physics in the linear part of the equation is an advantage .",
    "furthermore , considering the changes in the values of the scaling exponents of diffusion and viscosity as a function of chain length , due to the presence of entanglements , the choice of accounting for the effect of entanglements by using a simple perturbative approach to the unentangled dynamics seems questionable .",
    "the microscopic molecular approach presented here describes the time evolution of the space coordinates of a group of interacting chains , which at initial time are interpenetrating , as they interdiffuse in the field of the surrounding molecules .",
    "selecting a group of slow - moving , interacting chains is justified by the fact that polymers are glass formers and their dynamics present interchanging regions of slow and fast moving molecules . by taking advantage of the observed separation of timescales between slow moving and fast moving regions , we apply projection operator techniques and derive the equations of motion for the subensemble of slow interacting macromolecules , moving in the field of the fast ones.@xcite in the resulting langevin equation , intramolecular and intermolecular forces guide the dynamical behavior of the polymers as chains interdiffuse and finally become dynamically uncorrelated .",
    "the theory is microscopic and system specific because it describes the dynamics of polymers with specific flexibility _ at the given experimental thermodynamic conditions_,@xcite in this way it situates the dynamics of the polymer melt in the given point of its phase diagram . at the intramolecular level , each polymer is described as a finite chain of monomers connected by springs where the local rigidity due to conformational barriers is accounted for by using a constraint in the angle between bonds , i.e. the freely rotating chain model .",
    "this model is formally equivalent to the worm - like chain model , which has been extensively used to describe stiff molecules such as dna.@xcite other models of local barrier crossing and semi - flexibility could be easily implemented,@xcite but for the purpose of this work the proposed model is quite accurate .",
    "the entanglements are represented by a confining potential , which limits the relative separation distance between two monomers initially in contact , until the chain diffuses outside the entanglement constraint .",
    "the formalism is identical in both the unentangled and the entangled regimes , but the confinement due to entanglements become relevant only for those samples for which the chains are long enough for their diffusion to be slower than the time needed for the chains to disentangle .",
    "we selected polyethylene melts ( also reported in the literature as peb-2 samples ) to test this theory because data of the dynamics from neutron spin echo experiments are available for an extended range of the degree of polymerization , covering both unentangled and entangled dynamics.@xcite this enables us to complete a comprehensive study of the dynamics across the transition from unentangled to entangled dynamics and well into the two opposite regimes .",
    "the comparison of the theory with scattering data of unentangled dynamics was reported in an earlier publication,@xcite where the theory was used to test the theoretical description of the cooperative dynamics , while including effects of chain semiflexibility , but not yet the confining potential due to entanglements .",
    "a brief overview of the approach presented here has been published in a short publication.@xcite    in this paper the complete theory with the entanglement - generated confining interaction between chains is formalized and compared with the full set of data , both in the unentangled and in the entangled regimes .",
    "the presence of entanglements does not modify the theoretical predictions for unentangled samples , where @xmath2 , but provides a better agreement with the data in the crossover region , where our previous work using the theory of cooperative dynamics for unentangled chains showed some level of disagreement.@xcite",
    "the formalism presented in this paper builds on the theory for the cooperative dynamics of polymeric liquids@xcite which describes how a group of chains , initially in an interpenetrating configuration , inter - diffuse while their motion becomes progressively less correlated and finally recovers single - chain fickian diffusion .",
    "the presence of intermolecular interactions couples the interchain dynamics until the molecules interdiffuse a distance larger than the range of the interaction potential .",
    "this approach is general and applies to polymer melts of different local flexibility and monomeric chemical nature as well as polymers of increasing degree of polymerization , including both unentangled and entangled dynamics .",
    "the theory for unentangled chains was presented in a series of early papers@xcite and its extension to include entangled polymer dynamics was briefly illustrated in a recent short paper@xcite . here",
    ", we provide a detailed description of the formalism and an analysis of the different contributions to the experimental chain dynamics as they emerge from comparison with the theory .    given a group of @xmath3 polymers initially occupying a volume of the order of the polymer radius - of - gyration , @xmath4 , the time evolution of a generic monomer @xmath5 in the polymer @xmath6 is governed by a langevin equation in the space",

    "this apparent neglect of excluded volume interactions is based on flory s hypothesis that the chain statistics in a melt is unperturbed because intra and intermolecular excluded volume interactions tend to compensate each other .    in a recent series of papers",

    "this general behavior appears to be reasonable considering the fact that at short time the monomer dynamics is not affected by the length of the polymer chain the monomer belong to , because at short time the monomer only samples its local environment .",
    "a common local dynamics is in agreement with the physical hypothesis that motivates the coupling model approach , where local and global dynamics connect at an intermediate time scale which is similar for all polymers.@xcite",
    "this paper present a theoretical approach to the dynamics of polymer melts covering systems with different degrees of polymerization , spanning the dynamics from the unentangled to the fully entangled regime .",
    "the theory does nt need to be modified to describe the two different dynamical regimes observed for short and for long chains , and , to the best of our knowledge , it represents the first unified approach to polymer dynamics across the transition from unentangled to entangled motion .",
    "the flexibility of the formalism in addressing different systems is due to the many - chain nature of the approach , which allows for the simultaneous description of the dynamics of a group of interpenetrating polymer chains that are interacting and , if the chains are long enough , are also mutually entangled .",
    "as polymers are fractal object of order two , they expand in volume with increasing degree of polymerization , faster than they can fill their own volume . in this way",
    "the number of interpenetrating chains grows with chain length as @xmath220 .",
    "the dynamics in the entangled regimes reflects the interplay of the cooperative dynamics of @xmath220 macromolecules and entanglements .",
    "the theory selects at initial time a group of interpenetrating chains and monitors at increasing time intervals their dynamics as the chains interdiffuse and their motion mutually decorrelates .",
    "the chains are interacting through an effective center - of - mass pair potential that represents the projection of the many - body monomer - monomer interactions onto the polymer center - of - mass of a pair of chains .",
    "the monomer - monomer interactions propagate through the liquid of macromolecules surrounding the slow - moving chains undergoing cooperative motion . the mean field contribution due to the units that are projected out during the coarse - graining of the dynamics , which leads to the langevin equation ,",
    "result in an effective potential which is long - ranged and couples the dynamics of the slow moving chains .",
    "a second intermolecular potential that is included in the theory at the monomer level is the direct consequence of the chains being entangled .",
    "this potential limits the relative motion of two monomers belonging to two different chains , which are initially in contact and then interdiffuse freely until they experience the constraint in their dynamics due to entanglements . both potential depend in magnitude on the distances between the interacting units , which is evolving in time as the chains interdiffuse . in this way the system is considered in equilibrium only locally in the time domain , and the acting forces",
    "are solved self - consistently at any given time interval .",
    "finally all the molecules that are initially correlated become uncorrelated and at long enough time intervals the sampled dynamics is brownian . in this long time window , however , the effect of the entanglements is still present and affects the diffusion .",
    "the latter reproduces quantitatively the experimental data in both the unentangled and entangled regimes .",
    "chains that are initially interpenetrating need to move in a cooperative way for their dynamics to becomes both inter- and intramolecular uncorrelated .",
    "the dynamical mechanism of relaxation is conducive to the relaxation mechanisms observed in undercooled polymer liquids approaching their glass transition , with slow rearranging regions and fast motion of a few chains .",
    "the chain dynamics is characterized by the interplay between cooperative dynamics and the presence of entanglements .",
    "the latter tend to reinforce cooperative motion for the monomers that are comprised in the volume defined by the chain segment between two entanglements . in this way we observe that the region of cooperative dynamics increases in volume with the square of the chain length until polymers reach a length comparable with the entanglement lengthscale . at that point",
    "the region of cooperative motion is the same for all the samples with larger chain length that are analyzed in this study , and it is equal to the lengthscale of the entanglement length .",
    "it is reasonable to hypothesize that for chains longer than the ones described in this study , a secondary correlated motion could occur on the longer lengthscale of the chain size where the cooperativity would involve the domains on the entanglement lengthscale in a hierarchical clustering of cooperative motion .",
