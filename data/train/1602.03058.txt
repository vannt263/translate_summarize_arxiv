    "when bulk water is in contact with a hydrophilic metallic interface , the water shows an exclusion zone ordered water layer that repels large objects such as colloidal particles and even heavy ions but can carry extra semi - conducting electrons@xcite . the exclusion zone layer of perhaps as thick as hundreds of microns may be considered to be an ordered phase of water .",
    "exclusion zone layers are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation@xcite at least when in contact with hydrophilic organic substrates .",
    "the same should hold true for metals . while there are many works on the water - metal interface without considerations of the layer of exclusion zone water , the understanding how electromagnetic radiation with a metallic surface immersed in water remains incomplete@xcite .",
    "the situation changed when experiments@xcite were performed yielding data on the work function required to bring an electron from the metal into the water .",

    "water molecules in the ideal vapor phase have a static polarizability@xcite of the form @xmath0 the value of the dipole moment is often incorrectly associated with a thermal mean dipole moment but this must thought through more carefully since in virtue of tumbling motions the thermal dipole moment is null .",

    "water is a liquid ferroelectric@xcite .",
    "the mean polarization @xmath10 is the order parameter for ferroelectricity in water .",
    "the water layer adjacent to the metal is thereby ordered with a structure in the polarization @xmath11 characteristic of a ferroelectric boundary .",
    "the ferroelectric order is illustrated below in fig .",
    "large objects of micron length scales are excluded from the ordered layer since such objects would destroy the polarization which would require a positive free energy to destroy ferroelectrcity@xcite .",
    "also excluded in the ordered water layer are positive ions and some other effectively large charged objects .    what does exists in the ordered exclusion zone water layer are extra electrons described in chemical terms as @xmath12 . some protons",
    "@xmath13 get absorbed into the metal leaving behind a net negatively charged exclusion zone layer .",
    "but other extra protons yield a positive charge beyond the water metal interface exist above the boundary of the exclusion zone layer perhaps a few hundred microns away from the metal water interface .",
    "the negative charged region which is the exclusion zone layer increases with the incidence of electromagnetic radiation wherein a battery voltage exists between the positively and negatively charged regions within water .",

    "these measurements have been listed in table [ tab1 ] .    to remove an electron from an isolated water molecule requires an energy of @xmath18 . to remove an electron from an isolated water molecule that is initially in the first excited state of an isolated water molecule requires an energy of @xmath19 .",

    "the state @xmath24 is in an electronic _ s _ state forming a scalar while the first excited state @xmath25 is in an electronic _ p _ state which is thereby triply energy degenerate forming an electric dipole vector .",
