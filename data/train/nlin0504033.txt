    "controlling chaotic transport is a key challenge in many branches of physics like for instance , in particle accelerators , free electron lasers or in magnetically confined fusion plasmas  @xcite .",
    "it covers a large variety of strategies . on the one hand",
    ", one can aim at recovering near integrable systems while on the other hand , one can request the existence of a boundary with strongly reduced transport that will act as some transport barrier . another feature that will prove to be essential when implementing the control scheme is the relative cost of such a control device with respect to its merits .",
    "the cost that is considered here will be characterized by the magnitude and complexity of the fourier spectrum of the control function with respect to that generating the spurious stochastic transport . in the case of systems",
    "such that it is essential to control a global transport property without significantly altering the original system under investigation nor its overall chaotic structure , one can restrict the control scheme to that of restoring a local transport barrier . in accordance with the latter idea , the control strategy that we develop here",
    "is based on building barriers by adding a small apt perturbation which is localized in phase space , hence confining all the trajectories .",
    "this local control strongly reduces the cost of the control scheme since only a small fraction of the phase space is modified .",
    "the counterpart is that the impact of such a localized reduction in transport must be efficient enough to be meaningful regarding the control strategy .    in the case of particle accelerators , free electron lasers , and magnetic fusion , the magnetic field",
    "is designed to confine the charged particles .",
    "hamiltonian dynamics allows one to describe the motion of the charged particles in such a magnetic field , and the confinement volumes readily take the form of invariant tori .",
    "the hamiltonian formalism appears to be particularly well suited to investigate the control of such systems . in this article",
    ", we consider the class of hamiltonian systems that can be written in the form @xmath2 i.e.  an integrable hamiltonian @xmath3 ( with action - angle variables ) plus a perturbation @xmath4 . provided the perturbation is not too small , the explicit dependence of @xmath4 on the angle variables breaks the invariance of the action variables and in a generic situation yields chaotic transport . the idea for controlling",
    "this transport is to modify the perturbation _",
    "slightly _ and _ locally _ and create regular structures ( like invariant tori ) .    in the theory of magnetic confinement , the particle trajectories are characterized by three invariants , namely the magnetic moment , that is in fact an adiabatic invariant , the kinetic moment along the vertical axis which is the axis of symmetry of the axisymmetric equilibrium , and the particle energy ( for a collisionless plasma ) . in steady state solutions ,",
    "the various quantities of relevance for transport must solely depend on these invariants and not on the associated phases .",
    "when considering magnetic field lines , this six dimensional problem of the particle motion in phase space , can be reduced to a two dimensional one .",
    "the time variable then appears to be a toroidal angle , while the invariant is the toroidal flux and the hamiltonian , the poloidal flux .",
    "the conjugate angle of the toroidal flux is found to be a poloidal angle . in the case of a magnetic equilibrium ,",
    "the poloidal flux is solely a function of the action variable , the toroidal flux , both being labels of the magnetic surfaces , i.e.  invariant tori . in this approach , and for an axisymmetric equilibrium , the energy , namely the poloidal flux , can not depend on the angle since the latter depends linearly on the toroidal angle .",
    "it is therefore important that the unperturbed hamiltonian for an axisymmetric equilibrium does not depend on the angle .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , an explicit method of control was provided for generating @xmath5 such that the controlled hamiltonian @xmath6 is integrable .",
    "we point out that the control term we constructed is of order @xmath1 , i.e.  much smaller than the perturbation which is of order @xmath0 .",
    "this method of control has been applied experimentally to increase the kinetic coherence of an electron beam in a traveling wave tube  @xcite .",
    "one possible drawback of this approach is that the control term depends on all the variables and has to be applied on all the phase space .",
    "here we provide a method to construct control terms @xmath5 with a finite support in phase space , i.e.  localized in phase space , such that the controlled hamiltonian @xmath7 has invariant tori whose explicit expressions are known .",
    "for hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom , these invariant tori act as barriers to diffusion in phase space .    in the present paper , this original method is applied to the control of chaotic transport in fusion plasmas . however , these examples are sufficiently general so that one can readily transpose the approach to other fields of physics .",
    "let us consider two examples where the control of chaotic transport appears to be of particular interest .",
    "in a first example , one addresses the issue of large scale stochastic transport between two resonant surfaces . in tokamaks ,",
    "this situation is met when two tearing modes develop  @xcite and when their amplitude is large enough to satisfy the so - called overlap criterion proposed by chirikov  @xcite .",
    "this leads to chaotic transport from one resonant surface to the other .",
    "the control scheme can target two results , first to maintain a closed magnetic surface ( an invariant torus ) so that confinement can be sustained until some other action is taken to suppress the tearing modes , second , should the tearing mode interaction have led to a pre - disruptive phase , to generate a transport barrier sufficiently robust to slow the current quench and provide conditions for a controlled disruption with no generation of runaway electrons  @xcite .    in a second example , one considers the situation of an external modification of the magnetic equilibrium , for instance in the case of an ergodic divertor  @xcite where specific coils are implemented to generate chaotic transport in the outermost magnetic surfaces .",
    "a similar situation can be met in stellarators where the magnetic equilibrium can be such that a series of resonances in the plasma boundary creates a region of chaotic transport . in these cases",
    ", it can be of interest to control this chaotic boundary layer by restoring a closed magnetic surface at a given radius . in the latter case",
    ", one should consider a control scheme with similar properties to that generating the boundary layer with stochastic transport .",
    "this would ensure that a similar coil set to that generating the perturbation of the magnetic equilibrium can be used for the control purpose , hence ensuring some effectiveness in terms of cost and feasibility .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we provide an explicit construction of the localized control term . the equation of the created invariant torus is given explicitly . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , the formula of the control term for magnetic field lines is derived as well as the explicit formula for the magnetic surface which has been created by the localized control term . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , the two examples of magnetic perturbations are considered .",
    "it is shown on these examples that a small and apt modification of the poloidal flux is able to create a robust magnetic surface which prevents the diffusion of magnetic field lines .",
    "in the appendix , we give a proof of existence of the control term .",
    "in this section we present a control method of hamiltonian systems which is directly applicable to magnetic field lines .",
    "this version of localized control follows the one developed in refs .",

    "let us first analyze the properties of a specific class of hamiltonian systems that will provide the background for the control strategy . in the following @xmath8",

    "the magnitude of the control term computed in such a way appears to be a small fraction of the magnitude of the initial perturbation that led to the stochastic transport .",

    "in this phase the plasma current strongly decreases which leads to a loop - voltage spike in order to sustain the plasma current .",
    "such a voltage spike creates conditions for the transfer of the energy from the poloidal system to the plasma and specifically for the generation of runaway electrons .",
    "these are considered as a major problem in a device like iter since these runaway electrons will lead to very strong energy deposition on reduced areas and deep into the material given the slowing down distance of these energetic particles . as a consequence ,",
    "this phase of the disruption can lead to serious damage to wall components . defining appropriate control tools to reduce the energy transfer to a runaway population or to lower",
    "the runaway population is thus a key task for iter .",
    "one can readily assume that already in the thermal quench phase , a broad spectrum of magnetic perturbations is responsible for the confinement loss due to the onset of large scale transport governed by the overlap of the various modes of the spectrum .",
    "among these modes , one can expect that the low @xmath196 modes , such as the @xmath197 and @xmath198 , to overlap and govern a strongly enhanced transport as required for the thermal quench .",
    "when applying the control magnetic perturbation towards before the onset of the current quench , very likely when the stochastic core region comes into contact with the walls , one aims at restoring a magnetic surface between the two resonant surfaces . in practice , this yields a transport barrier ( with respect to the very degraded confinement during the thermal quench ) that will separate the core region , where the total current will be maintained , from the edge region where all the current will be lost due to the connection to the wall components .",
    "such an insulation ought to prevent the current quench and the generation of runaway electrons .",
    "should the loop - voltage spike be only partially suppressed , and a fraction of runaway electrons still generated , these should remain confined within the transport barrier .",
    "the control scheme applied to a tokamak disruptive phase thus appear to provide conditions for a soft landing with no current quench .",
    "applicability of such a scheme depends of course on the possibility to generate the spectrum of the control term .",
    "let us consider the spectrum of @xmath163 as given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : f2tearing ] ) .",
    "it consists of four modes , the two modes corresponding to the tearing modes that define the region where a magnetic surface is to be restored , hence the @xmath199 and @xmath200 modes and their nonlinear combination , namely the @xmath201 and @xmath202 modes .",
    "the relative magnitude of the modes determines the value of @xmath203 and therefore the location of the barrier in terms of the safety factor @xmath134 . for a given discharge",
    ", this parameter can be preset so that the activation of the control scheme will not require a real time computation of the required spectrum .",
    "the means to generate such a magnetic perturbation is to implement dedicated coils at the plasma boundary .",
    "of course , this means that one must contemplate the non - localized control .",
    "although it is not the purpose of the present paper to design the appropriate coils to generate these modes , one can underline the main features of the coil system .",
    "first , the required coils are significantly simpler than the coils required for boundary plasma control either of the ergodic divertor kind  @xcite or to control elms  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the low poloidal mode number of the modes that will therefore exhibit a moderate radial decay .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of the control term is typically 14% lower than required to generate stochasticity as required for boundary plasma control . of course a proper project would have to address many issues left open here , like the effect of a mismatch in magnitude of the control term , or the effect of spurious modes on the overall control efficiency",
    "however , the tests that have been performed to examine the robustness of the control procedure ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) give us confidence that these effects should only lead to moderate reduction of the control efficiency .",
