    "the dsphs have such low surface brightness that they have often been found serendipitously .",
    "for example , while sextans  @xcite was found as part of an automated search , the intrinsically far more luminous sagittarius dsph was first identified kinematically from a radial velocity survey of stars in galactic center fields  @xcite .    as such galaxies are resolvable into individual stars because of their proximity , they are detectable as enhancements in the stellar number density in large photometric surveys .",
    "for example , @xcite analyzed overdensities of m giants in the 2mass all sky survey and claimed the detection of a new disrupted dsph in canis major , although this remains controversial .",
    "@xcite systematically surveyed @xmath6 square degrees of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",

    "subsequent spectroscopic observations @xcite showed that ursa major was a dark matter dominated dsph .",

    "very recently , @xcite mapped out the stars satisfying the color cut @xmath7 in almost all of sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) .",
    "they dubbed this plot of the high - latitude galactic northern hemisphere the `` field of streams '' , owing to its wealth of prominent stellar substructure",

    "the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : cvn_disc ] shows a grayscale sdss image of the sky centered on the stellar overdensity ; note that no obvious object can be seen . however , a roughly elliptical overdensity of objects classified by the sdss pipeline as stars is readily visible in the photometric data ( upper middle and right panels ) .",
    "plotting these stars in a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) reveals a clear red giant branch ( rgb ) and horizontal branch ( lower panels ) .",
    "this cmd appears similar to that seen in sdss data for the sextans dsph ( see , e.g. , fig . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although considerably more distant .",
    "based on its apparent morphology and on the presence of a distinct stellar population , we conclude that this is most likely a hitherto unknown dsph galaxy . as is customary , we name it after its constellation , canes venatici ( cvn ) .",

    "the horizontal branch fit in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : cvn_disc ] provides supporting evidence for the reliability of our procedure . assuming a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath37 ( see below ) and a trgb color of @xmath38 , from the calibration of @xcite we obtain the relation @xmath39 , yielding a distance modulus of @xmath40 ( @xmath41 kpc ) .",

    ".    the age and metallicity of the stars in cvn can be estimated by comparison with the cmds of single epoch , single metallicity populations , e.g. , galactic globular clusters . in the lower right panel of figure [ fig : cvn_disc ] , we show a field - star - subtracted hess diagrams ( color - magnitude density plots ) in @xmath42 .",

    "the best match is to ngc  2419 , and in combination with the prominent horizontal branch , the similarity indicates that cvn is dominated by an old , metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath46 ) stellar population .",
    "the horizontal branch extends very far to the blue , although it is predominantly red .",
    "such red - dominated horizontal branches , hinting at a range of ages in the stellar population , are also seen in other metal - poor dsphs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    -0.20 cm    -0.6 cm    -0.7 cm    to investigate the spatial morphology , we select candidate members by applying a mask built as follows .",
    "first , we find the class conditional probabilities @xmath47 and @xmath48  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of a star belonging to cvn and the background , respectively .",

    "these objects are binned into @xmath52 bins , each @xmath53 , and smoothed with a gaussian with fwhm of @xmath54 to yield the plot in the lower panel .",
    "the density contours , representing 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 25@xmath55 above the background level , are markedly irregular , particularly in the outer parts  somewhat reminiscent of the ursa minor dsph .",
    "the black crosses are candidate blue horizontal branch stars ( bhbs ) selected with @xmath56 .",
    "the distribution of bhbs is elongated in the same manner as the density contours and traces the same underlying morphology .    to estimate the properties listed in table  [ tab : struct ] , we first analyze the morphology shown in figure  [ fig : cvn_morph ] to derive the centroid from the density - weighted first moment of the distribution , and the average ellipticity and position angle using the three density - weighted second moments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the radial profile shown in figure  [ fig : cvn_prof ] is derived by computing the average density within elliptical annuli after first subtracting a constant asymptotic background level ( 0.25 arcminute@xmath3 ) reached at large radii .",
    "we then fit the radial profile with standard plummer and exponential laws  ( figure  [ fig : cvn_prof ] , see also * ? ? ?",
    "the best - fitting position angle , ellipticity and half - light radii are listed in table  [ tab : struct ] . at the distance of cvn",
    ", the approximately @xmath57 half - light radius corresponds to @xmath5 pc .",
    "the overall extent is @xmath58 kpc along the major axis , making cvn one of the largest of the milky way dsphs .",
    "although plummer and exponential laws provide reasonable fits to the data , there are some discrepant datapoints in figure  [ fig : cvn_prof ]  ( cf .",
    "sextans profile in * ? ? ?",
    ".    the overall luminosity is computed by masking the stellar locus of cvn and computing the total flux within the mask and within the elliptical half - light radius .",
    "a similar mask , but covering a larger area to minimize shot - noise , well outside the main body of cvn , is scaled by relative area and used to compute the foreground contamination within the half - light radius . after correcting for this contamination ,",
    "the remaining flux is scaled to the total , assuming the fitted profiles are a fair representation of the overall flux distribution .",
    "we also apply a correction of @xmath59 magnitudes for unresolved / faint stars , based on the stellar luminosity functions of other low metallicity , low surface brightness dsphs . the resulting luminosity and central surface brightness estimates ,",
    "m@xmath60 and @xmath2 mag arcsec@xmath61 , are roughly consistent with the central surface brightness  absolute magnitude relation noted for local group dsph satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , cvn lies far from the central surface brightness ",
    "host galaxy distance correlation found for other local group dsph satellites ( e.g. , fig .",
    "7 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that this correlation may be at least partially due to observational biases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a search of the sdss dr5 spectroscopic database revealed the spectrum of a ch carbon star , sdss j132755.56 + 333521.7 , in close proximity to the center of cvn ( lower panel of figure [ fig : cvn_morph ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : spec ] , the star s spectral features indicate that it is most likely a giant , rather than a dwarf .",
    "there are no 2mass point sources within @xmath62 , and a comparison of the sdss coordinates with earlier - epoch apm data is consistent with zero proper motion , both of which would argue in favor of its being a distant object .",
    "finally , the carbon star s dereddened @xmath28-band magnitude is @xmath63 ; at the calculated distance modulus for cvn , @xmath64 , the star would have an absolute magnitude @xmath65 , fairly typical of a ch carbon giant .",
    "hence we conclude that sdss j132755.56 + 333521.7 is a carbon star in cvn .",
    "we measure a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath66 km s@xmath67 for the carbon star from cross - correlation with the spectrum of another ch carbon star of known velocity  ( 1249 + 0146 , see * ? ? ?",
    "the carbon star s radial velocity in the line of sight direction ( after correction to the galactic rest frame ) is @xmath68 km s@xmath67 .",
    "given the distance of cvn , this is also approximately the radial velocity that would be seen from the galactic center .",
    "we plan to obtain follow - up spectroscopy of rgb stars in cvn to supplement this first estimate of its systemic velocity with a more detailed analysis of the new dwarf s kinematics .",
    "we have discovered a new dwarf spheroidal milky way satellite in the constellation canes venatici .",
    "it has an absolute magnitude of @xmath1 and a surface brightness of @xmath69 mag arcsecond@xmath3 .",
    "we find that cvn is dominated by an old , metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath70 ) stellar population . at a distance of @xmath0 kpc ,",
    "cvn is one of the most remote of the known dsph companions to the milky way .",
    "it is important to carry out a well - defined census of milky way dwarf galaxies to the faintest possible luminosities .",
    "numerical simulations in cold dark matter cosmological models predict that the milky way s halo should contain about 500 satellites comparable to the dsphs  @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the handful of known milky way dsphs .",
    "the new dsph in canes venatici , taken with the recent discovery of ursa major  @xcite , emphasizes how incomplete our current knowledge is .",
    "further analysis of photometric data from large - area digital surveys such as sdss will thus likely lead to the discovery of more dsphs around the milky way in the near future .",
