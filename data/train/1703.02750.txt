    "study on the cold atomic system is one of the most active fields in physics nowadays @xcite . in particular , the vortex dynamics in atomic bose - einstein condensation ( bec )",
    "is investigated intensively by experiments @xcite , and also there are various theoretical studies on it @xcite . among various phenomena including turbulence , vortices play a very important role in classical and quantum fluid dynamics .",
    "recently , vortices and turbulence in becs of cold atoms are studied experimentally and theoretically and interesting results have been obtained .",
    "the cold atomic gases are highly controllable in experiments and the creation and observation of turbulence cascade are easier than other quantum systems . in particular , certain efficient methods to inject energy into bec systems have been proposed and used in experiments @xcite .",
    "theoretical and experimental investigation on quantum turbulence in cold atomic gases performed so far is summarized as follows . in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) case ,",
    "a random vortex tangle is an essential feature of quantum turbulence and the richardoson cascade is observed as typical dynamics of turbulence @xcite . in particular in a compressible quantum fluid , vortex core plays an important role and the healing length @xmath3 gives some specific length scale characterizing superfluid ( sf ) .",
    "inertial ranges with the kolmogorov @xmath0 spectrum exist in the infrared regime @xmath2 . in the 3d case ,",
    "this behavior is explained by the direct energy cascade from large scale to small scale through the richardson mechanism . on the other hand for the ultraviolet regime",
    "@xmath4 , an acoustic excitation in vortex cores gives @xmath5 behavior @xcite . in the 2d case ,",
    "similar spectrum structure is observed , but an important difference from the 3d case is the existence of the _ inverse cascade phenomenon_. that is , energy injected near @xmath6 moves toward the large scale region @xmath7 and influences configurations of vortices .",
    "existence of the inertial range with the kolmogorov @xmath0 spectrum attributes to the vortex distribution in 2d becs @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the behavior of quantized vortices and their dynamics in 2d cold atomic systems .",
    "in particular , we inject energies into the bec system in _ small length scale by a random noise _ and also apply a weak uniform magnetic field .",
    "it is usually expected that the random noise at scales smaller than the healing length @xmath3 only effects on the acoustic modes inside the vortex core , and it has nothing to do with the energy cascade . however in the present case ,",
    "the magnetic field plays a role of driving force to create vortices in the bec , and therefore the interplay of the applied magnetic field and the random local noise can produce nontrivial phenomena in the infrared regime .",
    "as the system is 2d , it is interesting to see if the system exhibits some specific phenomena like the inverse energy cascade as in the classical counterpart @xcite as well as some common feature of the general classical fluid mechanics @xcite . on the other hand , by varying the strength of the applied magnetic field @xcite , the total vortex number , i.e. , the enstrophy in the present case , can be controlled .",
    "this kind of versatility is specific feature of the cold atom system , and we expect that new aspects of the vortex dynamics are observed by experiments on the present cold - atom system .    for the white noise inducing local fluctuations of density , we consider a thermal noise caused by non - condensed ingredient of cold atoms or ideal thermal reservoir , which is expected to exist in any cold atomic gas systems .",
    "then our target model is _ a 2d bose - hubbard model _ ( bhm ) _ , in which effects of the thermal noise and the concomitant dissipation via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem _",
    "( fdt)_are taken into account_. we study real - time dynamics and universal law of _ a few _ quantized vortices created in sf state by the noise and magnetic field .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to see the elementary process of vortex creation by the above external effects .",
    "the thermal noise may affect intrinsically dynamical behavior of the bhm in a weak magnetic field , which is realized in the recent experiments @xcite . to study the phenomena ,",
    "we employ a langevin type of the gross - pitaevskii equation , called a stochastic gross - pitaevskii equation ( sgpe ) @xcite .",
    "this equation includes a noise term and a dissipative term , which are connected with each other by the fdt @xcite . as we show",
    ", these two terms considerably affect the vortex dynamics in the bec .",
    "in fact , we found that vortices are generated near the boundaries of the bec and they move into the bulk of the bec . in the bulk , the vortices exhibit a large cyclotron motion as a result of the inverse cascade of energy .",
    "the infrared regime of the incompressible energy spectrum ( ies ) of the kinetic energy exhibits the kolmogorov @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "after some period , which we call _ transition period _ , a large cyclotron motion of vortices gradually gets weak and vortex configuration approaches to a steady state of simple circular motions .",
    "then , the ies tends to have @xmath8 spectrum instead of @xmath0 . on the other hand for the ultra - violet regime of the wave number",
    ", we found that the ies always exhibits @xmath5 power law if vortices exist in the bulk of the system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we shall explain the bhm in the existence of a weak magnetic field , the local random noise , and the dissipation .",
    "previous works @xcite on the open quantum system obtained by integrating out  external degrees of freedom \" are quite useful to study the present target system .",
    "we show the sgpe of the bhm assuming that the noise and dissipation come from a thermal bath . in sec.iii",
    ", we exhibit the numerical results obtained by solving the sgpe of the bhm .",
    "we show that vortices intrude into the bulk sf through the boundary of the system .",
    "depending on the strength of the dissipation and noise , the number of intruding vortices varies .",
    "this phenomenon is a result of the inverse cascade of energy . intruding vortices exhibit a large cyclotron motion in the bulk sf .",
    "we also measure the temporal behavior the ies of the kinetic energy and the velocity of the fastest intruding vortex . from these measurement",
    ", we discuss the relationship between the power law of the ies and the velocity of the intruding vortex .",
    "section iv is devoted for discussion and conclusion . in this study",
    ", we consider the local noise stems from the thermal bath .",
    "however in the ultra - cold systems , it is possible to generate an artificial local noise .",
    "we mention how to generate an artificial local noise in the ultra - cold atomic systems in sec.iv .",
    "the hamiltonian of the bhm in an artificial gauge field is given as @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the boson annihilation ( creation ) operator at site @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "i.e. , @xmath23 , and the flux parameter @xmath21 is small .",
    "we shall study the vortex dynamics in the bhm . to this end , by replacing the field operator @xmath24 with a classical condensate field @xmath25 , the lattice version of gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) is given as follows @xcite , @xmath26 , \\label{dgpe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a chemical potential term @xmath27 has been added to @xmath28 . in what follows , we shall consider the extended formulation of the gpe of the bhm including the thermal noise and dissipation effects .",
    "this phenomenological model is given by a langevin type formulation of the lattice gpe .",
    "for the gpe in the continuum space , see refs.@xcite . then , including the noise and dissipative terms , we have @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 coming from dissipative coupling to a thermal bath , and @xmath32 is the random field corresponding to the noise with the local correlation in eq.([wn ] ) .",
    "@xmath33 is the lattice keldysh self - energy , and this self - energy is derived from the on - site interaction term by using the second - order perturbation theory @xcite .",

    "we treat the keldysh self - energy as an effective parameter independent of the space - time coordinate , @xmath40 . with this approximation ,",
    "the sgpe is given as @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "and then the noise correlation function is given by @xmath43 this noise is nothing but the genuine white noise    -@xmath44 plane .",
    "we take 10 samples in each point by varying the white noise . in finite number of votex cases , shortly after switching on the noise field @xmath45 vortex starts to intrude the bulk superfluid with rotational motion .",
    "each point indicates steady states after a transient time ( almost @xmath46 ) .",
    "@xmath47,width=302 ]        before performing the numerical simulations , we rescale the parameters and fields in the sgpe in eq.([sgpe3 ] ) .",
    "we first introduce the density unit @xmath48 and time unit @xmath49 , and then the time @xmath50 and the field @xmath51 are scaled as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we divide eq.([sgpe3 ] ) by @xmath54 , and take the hopping parameter @xmath14 as the units of the energy .",
    "then the sgpe is rewritten as , @xmath55 where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "we introduce a rescaled noise field @xmath58 , whose correlation is given by , @xmath59 here we have put @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . from this treatment , the following dimensionless sgpe are obtained , @xmath62    let us estimate typical values of the units . in bec regime , the typical hopping energy @xmath63 [ @xmath64 ) @xcite , then from the scaling relation @xmath65 , the time unit becomes @xmath66 [ msec ] .",
    "also we put the density @xmath67 , i.e. , one atom per one lattice site , which is feasible in real experiments .",
    "however , it is obvious that the later numerical results are applicable for other values of @xmath68 by rescaling @xmath69 and @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "finally , we remark that there exist constraints on temperature at which the phenomena predicted in the present work are to be observed in experiments .",
    "the first constraint comes from the fact that only the lowest - band in the optical lattice is considered in the present study .",
    "since we ignore the effects of the excited bands , the temperature is limited by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a band gap to the first - excited band .",
    "this band gap can be calculated by the band calculation for the optical lattice potential . as an example , for @xmath74rb gases in a typical square optical lattice @xcite , the band gap @xmath73 is estimated as @xmath75khz ( @xmath76nk ) for typical lattice depth @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the recoil enegy , and for the @xmath79 , @xmath80khz ( @xmath81 nk ) @xcite .",
    "second , the system temperature has to be lower than the sf transition temperature @xmath82 . while it is expected to be @xmath83 @xcite in large @xmath84 regime , the critical temperature @xmath85 in a deep bec regime ( i.e.",
    ", @xmath86 is large ) at unit filling is not precisely known .",
    "therefore , we simply assume that the system temperature @xmath87 is @xmath88nk .",
    "in this section , we show the results of the numerical study on the bhm , in which effects of the white noise and magnetic field are taken into account . in the numerical simulations , we fix the values of the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and study phenomena to obtain a ",
    "phase diagram\"in the @xmath91-plane .",
    "we solve the sgpe of eq .",
    "( [ sgpe_nd ] ) by the crank - nicolson implicit scheme @xcite for the 2d square lattice system with @xmath92 sites .",
    "we employ the sharp - boundary condition by introducing a wall potential with the height @xmath93 , which corresponds to the box - trap system realized in the recent experiments @xcite .",
    "we set the parameters as @xmath94 , @xmath95 with @xmath67 , which corresponds to a deep sf region in a weak magnetic field . as initial states ,",
    "we prepare a homogeneous sf state in which the phase and density of @xmath96 are almost uniform . in our numerics , starting with this initial state , the random noise @xmath97 is turned on at @xmath98 , and then afterward at @xmath99 , the uniform magnetic field @xmath17 is turned on .",
    "we employ the canonical ensemble by controlling the chemical potential @xmath100 suitably along the time evolution , i.e. , the total particle number is conserved along the time evolution although there is the dissipation .    before going into study on the target system , we examined the bhm coupled with a weak magnetic field in the absence of the noise .",
    "we found that _ vortices are not generated in this case_. this is nothing but the meissner effect .",
    "vortices are generated after application of the noise to this system .",
    "this means that the interplay of the magnetic field and the local noise is an essential ingredient for generation of bulk vortices in the present system .",
    "in addition , we examined the result of the reverse process , i.e. , random noise is turned on first and then the magnetic field is applied .",
    "we observed that the random noise makes phases of @xmath96 uniform , i.e. , the sf order is enhanced by the random noise .",
    "this is a kind of _ order by disorder _ , and is interesting phenomenon .",
    "we shall study this phenomenon in detail in the near future .      in this and subsequent sections",

    "first in fig",
    ".  [ gamma_sigma ] , we plot the average number of vortices generated by the noise effect in the @xmath101-@xmath44-plane .",
    "we examined ten samples of the random noise for each point in fig .",
    "[ gamma_sigma ] . at each point",
    ", the configuration approaches to an almost steady state after a transition period ( about @xmath46 ) .",
    "typical evolution of the system is as follows .",
    "when the noise and magnetic field are turned on , vortices start to intrude into the bulk sf from the boundary of the system , and then the intruding vortex exhibits a sightly complicated cyclotron motion and reaches to a final steady state of a circular motion .",
    "this phenomenon is caused by the interplay between the external magnetic field and the white noise as we explained above .",
    "the resultant dynamical behavior is highly sensitive to the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 , i.e. , the number of intruding vortex varies depending on the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ gamma_sigma ] , the number of intruding vortex tends to large as the ratio @xmath102 defined by @xmath103 is getting large .",
    "the reason is that the large noise amplitude ( @xmath104 : large ) directly modulates the superfluid density , and then topological defects in the sf tend to be created in the boundary of the system , thus vortices tend to form .",
    "time evolution of the density and phase of the bec for the two - vortex case , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , in fig .",

    "[ density_phase ] .",
    "the results in the upper panels show that the density of the bec is modulated by the noise and holes , which generate in the boundary , move into the bulk of the bec .",
    "the lower panels show that the bec has a phase coherence but the singularities exist at the locations of hole .",
    "these behaviors of the density and phase clearly indicate the generation of two vortices and their behavior in the bec .",
    "figure  [ trajectory1 ] shows the detailed trajectories of the intruding vortices obtained by solving the sgpe . in the practical numerical study",

    "[ trajectory1 ] corresponds to a point indicated in fig.[gamma_sigma ] . in all",
    "observed cases in fig .",
    "[ gamma_sigma ] except the cases without vortices , the bec density starts to fluctuate immediately after turning on the noise , and vortices start to intrude from the boundary of system into the bulk .",
    "then the spiral motion of vortices takes place until they reach to a stable circular motion .",
    "we note that these vortex motions are related to _",

    "some previous works @xcite reported that such a phenomenon is a typical behavior of quantum turbulence in 2d sf in contrast to quantum turbulence in 3d systems @xcite . in the present sgpe , energy injection is performed by the noise field @xmath107 .",

    ", we assume that the dissipation and noise stem from the thermal fluctuations caused by the non - condensed atoms . however , there is a possibility to create artificial noises for atomic density by using optical speckle potentials in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "this method may create various noises with some spacial and/or time length correlation , and as a result , there appear a dissipation through the fdt .",
    "the numerical simulations in this work showed the vortex - nucleation process induced by the interplay of the magnetic field and the local white noise in certain parameter regime of the dissipation @xmath90 and noise amplitude @xmath104 .",
    "moreover the sgpe simulation observed the intruding behavior of vortices .",
    "vortices exhibit large cyclotron motions at early stage of the intrusion and this behavior is understood as a phenomenon of the inverse energy cascade , which is one of the characteristic elements of 2d turbulence . to investigate the vortex dynamics in detail , we studied the time evolution of the ies and the velocity of vortcies in the bulk sf .",
    "once the intruding vortices appear in the bulk sf , the ies has the @xmath5 power law in the ultraviolet regime @xmath109 .",
    "furthermore , the numerical calculation of the ies indicates that when the intruding vortices has large velocity and large cyclotron motion , the kolgomolov @xmath0 spectrum appears in the infrared regime @xmath153 , which corresponds to the inertial range of turbulence . after the transition period ,",
    "the large velocity and the large cyclotron motion are suppressed by the dissipation , and the kolgomolov @xmath0 spectrum in the ies is replaced with the @xmath8 spectrum .",
    "we found that the above mentioned phenomena are independent to the number of the vortex in the sf .",
    "we also found that there exists a critical velocity of the fastest vortex at which the ies in the infrared regime changes from the kolgomolov @xmath0 spectrum to the @xmath8 spectrum . in appendix , as a subsidiary work , we report the study of cold atomic gases in a 2d optical lattice by means of the _ continuum sgpe_. similar qualitative properties of vortices in bec have been obtained there .",
    "the detailed study on the origin of the kolgomolov spectrum and the energy flux will be reported in our future work .",
    "finally , we hope that optical lattice experiments observe such vortex dynamics numerical - simulated in this work .",

    "in this appendix , as a subsidiary work , we study a continuum gpe describing cold atomic gas on a 2d optical lattice potential . this model is regarded as the continuum version of the gpe of the bhm . here , we investigate the effect of the lattice potential for quantized vortices created by the noise and the magnetic field .",
    "the system corresponds to the previous simulation in sec .",
    "iii , that is , the interplay of a small magnetic field and a white noise creates vortices in bulk bec .",
    "let us switch to a continuum model that takes into account effects of the optical lattice by a potential .",
    "the model is obtained by introducing the continuum order parameter field @xmath154 .",

    ", we put the computational - square mesh with interval @xmath165 .",
    "this interval length is sufficiently small compared with the healing length @xmath3 .",
    "thus , we can capture the core structure and the dynamical behavior of vortices . in numerical - simulating this model , as one of typical experimental examples",
    ", we consider a gas of @xmath74rb atom that has the physical parameters , @xmath166[kg ] , @xmath167[@xmath168 , and we put the optical lattice potential depth @xmath157 as @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the recoil energy of @xmath74rb .",
    "moreover , system density is set to be unity ( almost one particle ) in each potential well of @xmath156 .",
    "the system size is @xmath171 .    in numerical - simulating the model ( [ cgpe2 ] )",
    ", we use the same initial state and boundary condition as in sec.iii .",
    "please note that also in this continuum sgpe , only the weak magnetic field alone , i.e. , in the absence of the noise , can not create stabilized vortices in the bulk as in the previous case in sec .",
    "the density snapshots in generating vortices on the sytem are shown in fig .",
