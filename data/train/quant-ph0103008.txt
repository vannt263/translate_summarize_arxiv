    "recently , we suggested a solid - state nuclear spin quantum computer based on magnetic resonance force microscopy ( mrfm ) @xcite . in this proposal , a ferromagnetic particle , which is attached to the tip of the cantilever , moves along a chain of paramagnetic ions ( atoms ) located below the surface of silicon",
    "the ferromagnetic particle targets a particular ion , providing selective excitation of its electron or nuclear spin , a measurement of the state of the nuclear spin , and initial polarization and one - qubit rotations of nuclear spins .",
    "a two - qubit control - not ( cn ) gate for two neighboring nuclear spins utilizes the dipole - dipole interaction between the nuclear spin of one ion and the electron of the neighboring ion .",
    "there are three basic disadvantages in the suggested mrfm proposal : 1 ) the motion of the ferromagnetic particle along the chain of paramagnetic ions can induce additional dephasing in the spin system .",
    "this dephasing must be taken into account .",
    "2 ) fluctuations of the position of a ferromagnetic particle cause additional decoherence in a spin system .",
    "3 ) the accurate positioning of the ferromagnetic particle relative to an ion is a complicated experimental problem .    in this paper , we suggest a quantum computer architecture which seems to be free of all these disadvantages . at the same time , it retains the main advantage of the mrfm proposal  it does not require an array of single - atom gates , which is an essential part of well - known solid - state proposals based on silicon technology @xcite .",
    "we give estimates for characteristic parameters required for realization of a quantum computer based on the stm technique .",
    "our proposal utilizes recent results in stm experiments which seem to allow detection of the precessing electron spin from a single ion ( atom ) . in these experiments @xcite , the stm technique was used to measure the frequency of the larmor precession of an electron spin of an individual iron atoms in silicon in the presence of a small , static applied magnetic field .",
    "this measurement utilizes the interaction between a localized electron spin in a surface of a sample and the current produced by tunneling electrons . due to this interaction",
    "the tunneling probability is affected by the larmor precession of a localized spin , and the tunneling current is modulated at the larmor frequency .",
    "the mechanism causing the tunnel current modulation is , however , not well understood .",
    "while this requires additional consideration , in this paper we assume that the stm technique is able to detect the frequency of electron spin precession for an individual ion ( atom ) in a silicon surface .",
    "this results in the possibility for the stm technique to detect the state of a nuclear spin in the same ion . indeed , suppose that the hyperfine interaction between electron and nuclear spins of the ion is greater than the zeeman interaction between a high external magnetic field , @xmath2 , and the nuclear spin .",
    "then , the frequency of an electron spin precession depends on the state of the nuclear spin . as an example , following @xcite , we consider a @xmath3 ion ( a - center ) in the surface of silicon .",
    "the hamiltonian of the electron - nuclear spin system of the ion has the form , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are electron and nuclear spin operators ( @xmath7 ) ; @xmath8 is a high magnetic field pointed in the positive @xmath9-direction ; @xmath10 , @xmath11 ; and @xmath12ghz is the constant of the hyperfine interaction .",
    "the magnetic moments of the @xmath13 nucleus and the electron are both negative .",
    "1 , demonstrates the energy levels of the electron and nuclear spins of the @xmath3 ion in a high magnetic field .    if the nuclear magnetic moment points `` up '' , the modulation frequency is , @xmath14 in the opposite case , @xmath15 the hyperfine splitting is @xmath16 . if the tunneling current is observed to oscillate with the frequency @xmath17 , the nuclear spin of the ion is in its ground state .",
    "otherwise the nuclear spin is in the excited state .",
    "to provide a selective excitation of the nuclear spin ( qubit ) , we assume that a permanent magnetic field is slightly non - uniform in the @xmath18-direction ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . assuming that the distance between the neighboring ions is @xmath19",
    ", we have , for the difference in the precession frequencies for these ions , @xmath20 the corresponding difference for nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) frequencies is , @xmath21 ( in eq .",
    "( 4 ) we assume that nuclear spins of the neighboring ions are in the same state . in eq . ( 5 ) we assume that the electron spins of the neighboring ions are in the same state . ) as an example , taking @xmath22 nm and @xmath23t / m , we obtain for @xmath24te : @xmath25khz .    for selective excitation of a nuclear spin , one can apply a @xmath26- or @xmath27-pulse of a rotating magnetic field , @xmath28 .",
    "the nuclear rabi frequency , @xmath29 , is given by , @xmath30 for selective excitation , this quantity must be less than @xmath31 .",
    "it imposes a restriction on the duration , @xmath32 , of a @xmath26-pulse , @xmath33 using selective nuclear @xmath26-pulses one can drive a nuclear spin chain into the ground state . for this purpose one prepares the system in a high magnetic field at a low temperature , so that all electron spins are in their ground state .",
    "( as an example , @xmath34 t , @xmath35k . ) then , one measures the modulation frequency of the tunneling current at any position , @xmath36 .",
    "if the modulation frequency fits the value , @xmath37 , one applies a selective nuclear @xmath26-pulse with the frequency , @xmath38 , which drives the nuclear spin into the ground state .",
    "the ability to implement a cn gate is important for quantum computation as any quantum algorithm can be decomposed into a sequence of one - qubit rotations and cn gates @xcite .",
    "we propose to use a scheme close to that outlined in our mrfm proposal @xcite .",
    "it consists of three steps :    \\1 ) one applies an electronic @xmath26-pulse with the frequency @xmath39 .",
    "this pulse drives the electron spin of the ion `` k '' into the excited state only if the nuclear spin of the ion `` k '' ( a control qubit ) is in the excited state .",
    "the hyperfine splitting of the ion must be smaller than the difference , @xmath40 , of precession frequencies of neighboring ions . for @xmath41t /",
    "m we have : @xmath42mhz .",
    "so , this condition is satisfied , and the frequency , @xmath37 , is unique in the spin chain .",
    "( the dipole - dipole contribution to the oscillation is small in comparison to the hyperfine splitting . )",
    "\\2 ) one tunes the frequency of the nuclear @xmath26-pulse for the ion `` k+1 '' ( or `` k-1 '' ) taking into consideration the dipole field produced by an electron spin on the nuclear spin of the ion `` k+1 '' ( a target qubit ) .",
    "if the electron spin of the ion `` k '' did not change its direction , the nmr frequency for the ion `` k+1 '' ( taking into account a dipole field of electron spins ) is , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the dipole shift due to two neighboring electron spins , and @xmath45 is the dipole shift due to all other electron spins .",
    "( for @xmath22 nm , @xmath46hz , @xmath47hz , the nuclear - nuclear dipole interaction is negligible . )",
    "if the electron spin of the ion `` k '' has changed its direction , then the nmr frequency for the ion `` k+1 '' is , @xmath48 the difference , @xmath44 , between the frequencies ( 8) and ( 9 ) must be smaller than @xmath49 . in our case",
    "this condition is satisfied , so both frequencies ( 8) and ( 9 ) are unique in a spin chain . if the frequency of a nuclear @xmath26-pulse is tuned to ( 9 ) , and the rabi frequency , @xmath29 , of the nuclear @xmath26-pulse is less than @xmath44 , then the nuclear spin of the ion `` k+1 '' changes its direction only when the control qubit is in the excited state .",
    "this provides an implementation of a cn gate .",
    "this step imposes a most severe restriction on the duration of a quantum gate : @xmath50ms .",
    "the same step imposes a restriction on the electron relaxation time which must be greater than @xmath32 .",
    "( available data @xcite show that the electron relaxation time for paramagnetic impurities can be much greater than @xmath51ms . )",
    "\\3 ) finally , one repeats the first step to drive an electron spin of the ion `` k '' back to the ground state , if the control qubit is in the exited state .",
    "we proposed a nuclear spin solid - state quantum computer based on scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "our proposal does not require sophisticated single - atom electrostatic gates .",
    "a single - spin measurement is provided by measuring the modulation of the tunneling current .",
    "selective excitation of a nuclear spin can be achieved using an inhomogeneous permanent magnetic field .",
    "a control - not gate is provided by utilizing the dipole - dipole interaction between the electron and nuclear spins .",
    "our envisioned stm quantum computer would operate at high magnetic field ( @xmath0 t ) and at low temperature @xmath1k .",
