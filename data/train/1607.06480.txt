    "since the launch in june 2008 of _ fermi _ lat @xcite , a high - energy ( he ) satellite measuring @xmath2-rays in the range 20 mev@xmath3300 gev , two pulsar catalogues ( 1pc , @xcite ; 2pc , @xcite ) discussing the light curve and spectral properties of 117 pulsars have been released . the vast majority of the _ fermi_-detected pulsars display exponentially cutoff spectra with cutoffs around a few gev .",
    "these spectra are believed to be due to curvature radiation ( cr ) , which is assumed to be the dominating emission process in the gev band ( see section  [ subsection : radiationmechanisms ] ) .      there",
    "exist several physical radiation models that can be used to study he emission from pulsars .",
    "these include the polar cap ( pc ; @xcite ) , slot gap ( sg ; @xcite ) , outer gap ( og ; @xcite ) , and the pair - starved polar cap ( pspc ; @xcite ) models , which can be distinguished from each other based on the different assumptions of the geometry and location of the ` gap regions ' .",
    "the ` gap region ' is where particle acceleration takes place due to an unscreened , rotation - induced @xmath4-field parallel to the local @xmath5-field , as well as subsequent emission by these particles .    in pc models emission from he particles",
    "is assumed to originate close to the neutron star ( ns ) surface .",
    "these particles are accelerated by large @xmath4-fields near the magnetic poles ( known as the magnetic pcs ) only up to a few stellar radii . in sg models ,",
    "the radiation comes from narrow gaps close to the last open field lines ( the field lines that are tangent to the light cylinder where the corotation speed equals the speed of light @xmath6 ) , with the gaps extending from the ns surface up to high altitudes . in the og model",
    ", the gap region extends from the null - charge surface , where the goldreich - julian charge density is zero @xcite up to high altitudes , also close to the last open field lines .",
    "the pspc model involves a gap region that extends from the ns surface to the light cylinder over the full open volume @xcite , since the potential is unscreened in this case , so that there are not enough pairs to fully screen the @xmath4-field .      to explain he emission in the standard models , one has to take detailed particle transport and radiation mechanisms into account .",
    "these mechanisms include cr , synchrotron radiation ( sr ) , and inverse compton scattering ( ics ) .",
    "cr occurs whenever charged particles are constrained to move along curved paths , e.g. , along curved @xmath5-field lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) , therefore involving a change in their longitudinal kinetic energy .",
    "when the emitted cr photon energy and the local @xmath5-field are high enough , magnetic pair production may occur ( where an he photon converts into an electron - positron pair , @xmath7 ) , leading to a cascade of @xmath7 pairs which may screen the parallel @xmath4-field outside the gaps .",
    "the pair cascade is characterized by the so - called multiplicity , i.e. , the number of pairs spawned by a single primary .",
    "the pairs may radiate sr if they have velocity components perpendicular to the local @xmath5-field so that this process involves a change in the particles transverse kinetic energy .",
    "also , ics occurs due to the relativistic particles which upscatter soft photons ( e.g. , originating at a heated pc ) , which results in the `` boosting '' of the photon energies up to very high energies .",
    "ics photons may also be converted into @xmath7 pairs .",
    "two - photon pair creation ( @xmath8-absorption ) may also occur , in particular in og models .",
    "cyclotron emission combined with subsequent ics has also been considered by @xcite to explain the broadband spectrum of the crab pulsar .",
    "early prediction of the phase - averaged spectrum for the vela pulsar .",
    "the solid lines represent the spectral components for cr , sr , and the thermal surface flux ( kt ) .",
    "the dashed curve represents the tev pulsed spectral component associated with the ics of sr of the primary @xmath7 ( ssc ) .",
    "adapted from @xcite . ]",
    "early modelling , assuming the standard og model , predicted spectral components in the vhe regime when estimating the ics of primary electrons on sr or soft photons .",
    "this resulted in a natural bump around a few tev ( involving @xmath9 tev particles ) in the extreme klein - nishina limit as seen in figure  [ romani96 ] and [ hirotani01 ] .",
    "however , these components may not survive up to the light cylinder and beyond @xcite , since @xmath8 pair creation leads to absorption of the tev @xmath2-ray flux .",
    "expected tev spectra for three bright pulsars including the crab ( solid lines ) , psr b0656@xmath1014 ( dashed lines ) , and psr b1509@xmath358 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the thick and thin curves represent inclination angles ( between the spin and magnetic axis ) of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively @xcite . ]",
    "other studies assumed cr to be the dominant radiation mechanism producing @xmath2-ray emission when performing spectral modelling and found spectral cutoffs of up to 50 gev .",
    "for example , @xcite modelled the cutoffs of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "these are pulsars which possess relatively low @xmath5-fields and short periods .",
    "their model assumed a static dipole @xmath5-field and a pc geometry , and predicted cr from the primary electrons that are released from the pc .",
    "their predicted cr spectral component cut off at @xmath13  gev .",
    "the cr photons may undergo pair production in the intense low - altitude @xmath5-fields , and the newly formed electron - positron secondaries will emit sr in the optical and x - ray band ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , they concluded that the he cr from msps occurred in an energy band that was above the detection range of satellite detectors like _ energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) _ and below that of ground - based cherenkov detectors such as the _ high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s .",
    "i)_.    later studies investigated the x - ray and @xmath2-ray spectrum of rotation - powered msps using a pspc model @xcite , and found cr cutoffs of @xmath14  gev ( see @xcite ) .",
    "optical to @xmath2-ray spectra were also modelled by @xcite assuming an sg accelerator and a retarded vacuum dipole ( rvd ) @xmath5-field , for the crab pulsar .",
    "they found spectral cutoffs of up to a few gev .",
    "another study modelled the phase - resolved spectra of the crab pulsar using the og and sg models , and found he cutoffs of up to @xmath15  gev @xcite .",
    "cutoffs around @xmath16  gev were found for the og model using the rvd @xmath5-field @xcite .",
    "in view of the above theoretical paradigm it was not expected that a pulsar should be visible in the vhe regime .",
    "it was therefore surprising when the _ very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ) _ announced the detection of pulsed emission from the crab pulsar above @xmath13  gev @xcite , followed by the detection by the _",
    "major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cherenkov ( magic ) _ of emission up to @xmath17  gev ( soon after their initial detection of emission at @xmath15  gev ) @xcite .",
    "the _ magic _ collaboration has since reported the detection of pulsed photons with energies up to 1.5  tev @xcite .",
    "ground - based cherenkov telescopes are now searching for more examples of vhe pulsars .",
    "the observed and modelled spectra for phase - resolved @xmath2-ray emission , including both emission peaks p1 and p2 , from the crab pulsar as measured by _ magic _ ( dark red squares ) .",
    "the plot also contains measurements from _ fermi _ lat ( orange diamonds ) and _ veritas _ ( light blue squares and solid line ) .",
    "an og model including emission from pairs are assumed .",
    "the systematic error of the _ magic_-stereo measurement is shown and corresponds to a shift of @xmath1817% in energy and @xmath1819% in flux . from @xcite . ]    in figure  [ magic ] the phase - resolved @xmath2-ray spectrum for the crab pulsar for both light curve peaks p1 and p2 , as measured by _ magic _ , is shown .",
    "the spectrum also contains measurements by _ fermi _ lat and _ veritas_. the observations by _ magic _ are in good agreement with those by _ veritas_. the _ veritas _",
    "data fit a broken power law , and raised important questions whether the cr component is extended or if a second component is required to explain the observed spectra .",
    "the detection of the crab pulsar above several gev prompted _ fermi _ to search for pulsed emission at he s .",
    "they detected significant pulsations above 10  gev from 20 pulsars and above 25  gev from 12 pulsars @xcite .",
    "the crab pulsar is the first source which have been detected over almost all energies ranging from radio to vhe @xmath2-rays .",
    "more recently , pulsed emission was detected from the vela pulsar above 30 gev with the _ h.e.s.s .",
    "_ @xcite and up to @xmath19  gev ( at the @xmath20-level ) with the _ fermi _ lat @xcite .",
    "_ magic _ furthermore detected no emission from geminga above 50 gev  @xcite ; neither did _ veritas _ above 100  gev  @xcite .",
    "a stacking analysis involving 115 _ fermi_-detected pulsars ( excluding the crab pulsar ) was performed by @xcite using _ fermi _ data .",
    "however no emission above 50 gev was detected , implying that vhe pulsar detections may be rare , given current telescope sensitivities .",
    "from all these observations there are three effects visible in the energy - dependent pulse profiles : the peaks remain at the same phase , the p1/p2 ratio decreases as energy increases , and the pulse width decreases with increasing energy .",
    "more vhe pulsars may be found by the _ cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) _ which will have a ten - fold increase in sensitivity compared to present - day cherenkov telescopes .",
    "all of the standard pulsar emission models ( see section  [ subsection : emissionmodels ] ) predicted he spectral cutoffs between a few gev and up to @xmath13  gev , assuming @xmath5-fields such as the static dipole and rvd solutions .",
    "clearly , refinements to these radiation models and @xmath5-fields are needed to explain the observed vhe emission from the crab .",
    "there are a few ideas for such refinements .",
    "one is a revised og model by @xcite which can produce ic radiation of up to @xmath17  gev due to secondary and tertiary pairs upscattering infrared to ultraviolet photons @xcite . in this og model",
    "the ic flux depends sensitively on the @xmath5-field structure near the light cylinder .",
    "another idea was proposed by @xcite , invoking the ssc radiation process .",
    "this is indeed a promising radiation mechanism , where relativistic particles upscatter the sr photons emitted by the same population .",
    "the ssc radiation mechanism was applied by @xcite to predict optical to x - ray , and @xmath2-ray spectra ( see figure  [ ssc ] ) assuming an sg model and a force - free @xmath5-field .",
    "this process relies critically on the assumed electrodynamics and the magnetospheric structure .",
    "they performed simulations for the crab and vela pulsars , as well as two msps , i.e. , b1821@xmath324 and b1937@xmath1021 .",
    "however , the only significant predicted ssc component was for the crab pulsar .",
    "they also found that the pair sr matched the observed x - ray spectrum of the msps .",
    "they furthermore tested the addition of an he power law extension to the pair spectrum ( dashed lines in figure 4 ) whose sr spectrum would account for the observed emission in the @xmath21  mev range",
    ". however , the resulting ssc component exceeded the observed _ magic _ and _ veritas _ points , implying that the observed @xmath21  mev emission is not produced by the same particles that produce the ssc emission .",
    "modelled spectrum of phase - averaged pulsed emission from the crab pulsar .",
    "the spectral components from primary electrons and pairs ( as labelled ) are for a magnetic inclination angle @xmath22 , observer angle @xmath23 and pair multiplicity @xmath24 . from @xcite . ]",
    "the abovementioned detections of the vhe pulsed emission from pulsars and the explanation thereof implies that this emission may yield strong constraints on @xmath2-ray radiation mechanisms , the location of acceleration regions , and the @xmath5-field structure .",
    "there is thus an urgent need for refinements and extensions of standard pulsar emission models and radiation mechanisms , including more realistic @xmath5-fields .",
    "some examples are discussed above , but there are many more .",
    "sg model refinements include photon - photon pair production attenuation within the model and also more realistic @xmath5-fields such as dissipative magnetospheric solutions .",
    "one could also model the emission pulse profiles as a function of energy .",
    "ground - based cherenkov telescopes are now searching for more examples of vhe pulsars .",
    "new pulsar models will assist us in predicting the level of vhe emission expected from them , which would be very important for the upcoming _",
    "cta_. the low threshold energy of _ cta _ will provide an overlap with the _ fermi _ energy range and will help to discriminate between cr and a potentially new spectral component .    this work is based on research supported by the national research foundation ( nrf ) of south africa ( grant numbers 90822 , 93278 , and 99072 ) .",
