    "polar codes are the first family of provably capacity achieving codes for symmetric binary - input discrete memoryless channels ( b - dmc ) with low encoding and decoding complexity @xcite @xcite .",
    "these codes polarize the underlying channel in the sense that , via channel combining and channel splitting stages , multiple uses of the given channel are transformed into equivalent polarized ones : either purely noisy ( referred to as `` bad '' channel instances ) or noiseless ( referred to as `` good '' channel instances ) .",
    "then , information symbols are mapped to the good instances of polarized channels , whereas channel inputs corresponding to the bad instances are fixed and shared between the transmitter and receiver .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the fraction of the good channel instances approaches the symmetric capacity of the channel , which is equal to the capacity of the underlying channel if the channel is symmetric .",
    "that is , polar codes achieve the capacity of symmetric b - dmcs .",
    "this phenomenon of channel polarization has then been generalized to arbitrary discrete memoryless channels with a construction complexity to the same order and a similar error probability behavior @xcite .",
    "moreover , polar codes are proved to be optimal for lossy compression with respect to binary symmetric source @xcite@xcite , and then further extended to coding for larger source alphabets @xcite .",
    "recently , polar codes have been adapted to channels with non - discrete inputs as well . in @xcite , using polarization results for multiple access channels @xcite , a polar coding scheme for additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels is presented .",
    "it is shown that the approach of using multiple access channel coding with a large number of binary - input users possesses much better complexity attributes compared to that of using single - user channels with large input cardinality . in a separate work @xcite , by adopting discrete polar codes as embedded codes , an expansion coding approach is presented , and the capacity of additive exponential noise channel is shown to be achievable in the high snr regime .    the analysis of polar coding for fading channels , with either discrete - valued or continuous - valued noises , is still limited .",
    "recent work @xcite investigates binary input real number output awgn fading channel , where the fading coefficient is assumed to be one of the two states with equal probabilities .",
    "these fading coefficients are assumed to follow arbitrary distributions with the requirement of satisfying some tail probability constraints . for this setup , the authors proposed polar coding schemes where symbols are multiplexed in a specific fashion at the encoder .",
    "in particular , the paper analyzes diagonal , horizontal , and uniform multiplexers ; and , the corresponding diversity and outage analysis have been performed .",
    "another recent work @xcite focuses on polar coding schemes for rayleigh fading channel under two scenarios : block fading with known channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter and fast fading with fading distribution known at the transmitter . for the latter case ,",
    "the channel is shown to be symmetric , and through quantization of the channel output , the polar coding scheme is shown to achieve a constant gap to the capacity .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on a block fading model without the csi at the transmitter , and propose a hierarchical polar coding scheme for such channels .",
    "first , we focus on fading binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) , which is an important model as it is closely related to an awgn block fading channel with bpsk modulation and demodulation .",
    "such binary input awgn models are previously analyzed in @xcite@xcite to evaluate the performance of polar codes over awgn channels . here , we focus on communication channel models that involve fading , where the channel coefficients vary according to a block fading model .",
    "this scenario of fading awgn with bpsk modulation resembles a fading binary symmetric channel model , where each fading block has a cross - over probability depending on the corresponding channel state realization .",
    "specifically , awgn channel states with higher snrs map to binary symmetric channels with lower crossover probabilities . for this binary symmetric fading model",
    ", we propose a novel polar coding approach that utilizes polarization in a _ hierarchical _ manner _ without _ channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter ( with channel state statistics assumed to be known at the transmitter ) . the key factor enabling",
    "our coding scheme is the hierarchical utilization of polar coding .",
    "more precisely , polar codes are not only designed over channel uses for each fading state , but also utilized over fading blocks . by taking advantage of the degradedness property of channel polarization between different bscs ,",
    "an erasure model ( over fading blocks ) is constructed for every channel instance that polarizes differently depending on the channel states .",
    "it is shown that this proposed coding scheme , without instantaneous csi at the transmitter , achieves the capacity of the fading binary symmetric channel .",
    "as an additional analog fading model ( in addition to the awgn fading scenario with bpsk modulation ) , we consider additive exponential noise channels . in analog channels , the additive exponential noise ( aen )",
    "channel is of particular interest as it models worst - case noise given mean and non - negativity constraints @xcite .",
    "in addition , the aen model naturally arises in non - coherent communication settings , and in optical communication scenarios @xcite@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "an expansion scheme is proposed to achieve the capacity of aen channels . here ,",
    "we adopt a similar approach for the fading aen channels .",
    "in particular , due to the decomposition property of the exponential distribution , we show that a fading aen channel can be transformed into a set of fading bscs .",
    "then , by employing the aforementioned polar coding scheme for fading bscs at each level , we show that the proposed method approaches to the capacity of fading aen channels in the high snr regime .",
    "in both cases considered in this paper , utilizing polar codes in such a novel ( hierarchical ) way enables coding without csi at the transmitter , a practically important scenario in wireless systems .",
    "in addition , the low encoding and decoding complexity of polar codes are inherited in the proposed schemes .",
    "( the scaling of complexity with respect to the system parameters are detailed in the later parts of the sequel . ) therefore , the proposed approach , by having both low complexity and realistic csi assumption properties , is suitable for practical utilization of polar codes over fading channels ( especially for those channels with long fading coherence intervals ) .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows . after a brief introduction of the preliminary results on polar codes in section  ii ,",
    "the polar coding scheme for fading binary symmetric channels is detailed in section  iii .",
    "section  iv is devoted to the study of fading additive exponential noise channels . finally , concluding remarks are provided in section  v.",
    "the construction of polar code is based on the observation of channel polarization .",
    "consider a binary - input discrete memoryless channel @xmath0 , where @xmath1 . define @xmath2.\\nonumber\\ ] ] let @xmath3 be the bit - reversal operator defined in @xcite , where @xmath4 . by applying the transform @xmath5 ( @xmath6 denotes the @xmath7 kronecker power of @xmath8 ) to the message @xmath9 , the encoded @xmath10 is transmitted through @xmath11 independent copies of channel @xmath12 .",
    "then , consider @xmath11 binary - input coordinate channels @xmath13 , where for each @xmath14 the transition probability is given by @xmath15 here , as @xmath11 tends to infinity , the channels @xmath16 polarize to either noiseless or purely noisy ones , and the fraction of noiseless channels is close to @xmath17 , the symmetric capacity of the channel @xmath12 @xcite .    to this end ,",
    "polar codes can be considered as @xmath18-coset codes with parameter @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the frozen vector ( can be set to all - zeros for symmetric channels @xcite , which is the focus of this paper ) , and the information set @xmath21 is chosen as a @xmath22-element subset of @xmath23 such that the bhattacharyya parameters satisfy @xmath24 for all @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "( the indices in @xmath21 are `` good '' channel indices , whereas those in @xmath27 corresponds to `` bad '' channel indices . )",
    "the decoder in the polar coding scheme is a successive cancellation ( sc ) decoder , which gives an estimate @xmath28 of @xmath9 given the knowledge of @xmath21 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 by computing @xmath31 in the order @xmath32 from @xmath33 to @xmath11 , where @xmath34 @xcite proved that by adopting an sc decoder , polar coding achieves any rate @xmath35 with an error scaling as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , the encoding and decoding complexity of polar coding are both @xmath38 , where @xmath11 is the length of codeword .    to summarize",
    ", polar codes have excellent rate and complexity , but the code design is sensitive to the channel state information at the transmitter . for example , the choices of `` good '' indices depend on the crossover probability @xmath39 of a bsc , i.e. , the set @xmath40 is a function of the value of @xmath39 .",
    "thus , it is not straight - forward to design capacity - achieving polar coding schemes if there is uncertainty in the channel parameters . in particular , for a block fading scenario , if the channel states are not known a priori at the transmitter , one may not know which indices should correspond to `` good '' channel instances . as detailed in the next section",
    ", the proposed scheme solves this problem via a hierarchical code design .",
    "fading channels characterize the wireless communication channels , where the channel states vary over channel uses .",
    "fading coefficients typically vary much slower than transmission symbol duration in practice . for such cases ,",
    "a block fading model is considered , wherein the channel state is assumed to be a constant over each coherence time interval , and follows a stationary ergodic process across fading blocks .",
    "for such a block fading model , we consider the practical scenario where the channel state information is available only at the decoder ( csi - d )  @xcite , while the transmitter is assumed to know only the statistics of the channel states .",
    "binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) is a channel with binary input @xmath41 , binary noise @xmath42 , and a binary output @xmath43 . here , for the fading bsc , the channel noise is a bernoulli distributed random variable , where its statistics depend on the channel states . for the block fading bsc considered in this work ,",
    "the channel is modeled as follows .",

    ", @xmath46 are assumed to be identically distributed within a block and follow an i.i.d . fading process over blocks .",
    "that is , if we consider fading bsc with @xmath47 states , with probability @xmath48 the parameter @xmath49 is chosen for the fading block @xmath50 , where the channel noise @xmath46 is sampled from a bernoulli random variable with parameter @xmath49 for all @xmath14 . here , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    in wireless communications ,",
    "the fading binary symmetric channel is utilized to model a fading awgn channel with bpsk modulation and demodulation . in particular , for a fading awgn channel with input power constraint @xmath53 , the channel noise is distributed as i.i.d .",
    "gaussian with variance @xmath54 , and the channel gain ( the factor @xmath55 in the awgn channel @xmath56 ) remains the same statistic within a fading block , and follows an ergodic process over different blocks .",
    "after utilizing the bpsk modulation and demodulation at the encoder and decoder , respectively , the equivalent channel is a binary input and binary output channel , with transition probability relating to awgn channel state .",
    "more precisely , if the channel gain for a particular fading block @xmath50 , @xmath57 , is equal to @xmath58 with probability @xmath48 for some @xmath59 , then the corresponding binary noise in the equivalent fading bsc has the statistics of @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the cdf of normal distribution and @xmath62 is the signal - to - noise ratio , i.e. @xmath63 . in other words ,",
    "the channel at each fading block can be modeled as @xmath64bsc@xmath65 with probability @xmath48 .",

    "note that , the ergodic capacity of fading bsc is an average over the capacities of all possible channels corresponding to different channel states . in this section ,",
    "we propose a polar coding scheme that achieves the capacity of this fading bsc with low encoding and decoding complexity , without having instantaneous channel state information at the transmitter . towards this end , we first focus on a fading bsc with two channel states , and then generalize our results to arbitrary finite number of channel states .      in polar coding for a bsc , we see that the channel can be polarized by transforming a set of independent copies of given channels into a new set of channels whose symmetric capacities tend to @xmath68 or @xmath33 ( for all but a vanishing fraction of indices ) . towards applying such a polarization phenomenon to fading bsc ,",
    "we first focus on how two binary symmetric channels polarize at the same time .",
    "we summarize a result given in @xcite regarding the polarization of degraded channels .",
    "for two binary symmetric channels @xmath69 and @xmath70 , if @xmath71 is degraded with respect to @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 , then for any channel index @xmath14 , the reconstructed channels after polarization have the relationship that @xmath74 is degraded with respect to @xmath75 , and hence @xmath76 .    that is , when polarizing two binary symmetric channels , the reconstructed channels of the degraded channel have lower symmetric rate compared to that of the other channel .",

    "when polarizing two bscs , the channel indices after reordering permutation @xmath80 can be divided into three categories ( we assume that channel @xmath33 is degraded , i.e. , @xmath73 ) :    1",

    "in this paper , polar coding schemes for fading binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) and fading additive exponential noise ( aen ) channel are proposed .",

    "this novel scheme , by exploiting an erasure decoding approach at the receiver , utilizes the polarization results of different bscs .",
    "( these bscs are defined over channel uses at a given fading block and over fading blocks at a given channel use index . )",
    "this novel polar coding technique is shown to be capacity achieving for fading bsc .",
    "remarkably , the proposed scheme does not assume channel state information at the transmitter and fading bsc models the fading additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel with a bpsk modulation .",
    "therefore , our results are quite relevant to the practical channel models considered in wireless communications .    towards utilizing the proposed techniques for encoding over another fading channel model",
    ", we focused on fading aen channel .",
    "for this model , expansion coding @xcite is adopted to convert the problem of coding over an analog channel into coding over discrete channels . by performing this expansion approach and making the resulting channels independent ( via decoding the underlying carries )",
    ", a fading aen channel is decomposed into multiple independent fading bscs ( with a reliable decoding of the carries ) . by utilizing the hierarchical polar coding scheme for fading bsc",
    ", both theoretical proof and numerical results showed that the proposed approach achieves the capacity of this fading channel in the high snr regime .",
    "we remark that the advantages of polar codes in rate and complexity are both inherited in the proposed coding schemes .",
    "more precisely , as polar codes achieve channel capacity of bsc and bec , our hierarchical utilization of polar codes also achieves the capacity of fading bsc , and this result is further utilized to guarantee that expansion coding scheme can achieve the capacity of fading aen channel in the high snr regime ( with low complexity in all cases ) .",
    "although the discussion in this paper focuses only on fading bsc and fading aen channel , the proposed coding scheme could be generalized to more general cases .",
    "for example , by utilizing non - binary polar codes , our polar coding scheme can be generalized to a fading non - binary discrete symmetric channel .",
    "this result can then be utilized for an awgn fading channel with more constellation points , such as qpsk . moreover",
    ", the expansion coding scheme can also be used for other analog channels that have noise statistics other than exponential , e.g. , gaussian . here , even though these distributions may not be perfectly approximated by a set of independent discrete random variables , expansion coding scheme can still perform well , especially at high snr .",
    "finally , we note that the proposed coding scheme requires long codeword lengths to make the error probability arbitrarily small .",
    "this requirement translates to requiring long coherence intervals and large number of fading blocks as our approach utilizes coding over both channel uses and fading blocks .",
    "( this is somewhat similar to the analyses in shannon theory , where the guarantee of the coding is that the error probability vanishes as the block length gets large . )",
    "therefore , our coding scheme fits to the fading channels with moderate / long coherence time and large number of fading blocks . here , we comment on applicability of the proposed coding scheme in typical wireless systems . as reported in @xcite , lte systems operating at @xmath290ghz frequency with @xmath291mhz bandwidth",
    "typically have fading durations of @xmath292 to @xmath293 channel uses .",

    "( here , a mobile speed of @xmath33 m/s is assumed for both systems . )",
    "polar codes , on the other hand , typically have error rates around @xmath297 when the blocklength is around @xmath298 , and a smaller error probability is even possible , when the decoding is implemented with a better decoder @xcite . for instance , instead of the classical sc decoder , a list decoder @xcite can be utilized . finally , besides long coherence intervals ,",
    "another requirement for the proposed coding scheme is to have large number of fading blocks .",
    "this requirement can be satisfied in many practical scenarios at the expense of having large decoding delays . to summarize , for a given wireless system and a choice of one of the encoding / decoding strategies discussed above",
