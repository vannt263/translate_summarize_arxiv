    "the emission or the scattering of light from localized sources is the most effective way for information to be transferred to the human eye , the window to our mind .",
    "we can increase the size of this window , with specialized detectors , or systems of detectors .",
    "they intercept the information , record and re - encode it , before passing it on to be assimilated and digested by our consciousness .",
    "the spacetime framework for most physical measurements , in particular those involving radiation and scattering processes , consists of inertial frames , or frames which become nearly inertial by virtue of the limited magnitude of their spatial and temporal extent .",
    "indeed , the asymptotic `` in '' and `` out '' regions of the scattering matrix as well as the asymptotic `` far - field '' regions of a radiator reflect the inertial nature of the spacetime framework for these processes .",
    "should one extend these processes to accelerated frames ?",
    "if so , how ?",
    "let us delay answering the first question and note that einstein , in his path breaking 1907 paper @xcite , gave us the answer to the second : view an accelerated frame as a sequence of instantaneous locally inertial frames .",
    "thus a scattering ( or any other physical ) process observed relative to a lattice of accelerated clocks and equally spaced detectors can be understood in terms of the lattice of inertial clocks and equally spaced inertial detectors @xcite of one or several of these instantaneous locally inertial frames .",
    "accelerated frames seem to be conceptually superfluous !",
    "acceleration can always be transformed away by replacing it with an appropriate set of inertial frames . to make observations relative to an accelerated frame comprehensible ,",
    "formulating them in terms of a sequence of instantaneous inertial frames seems ( at first sight ) to be sufficient .",
    "the introduction of these inertial frames into physics was one of the two historical breakthroughs @xcite for einstein , because mathematically they are the tangent spaces , the building blocks from which he built general relativity .",
    "however , characterizing an accelerated frame as a one - parameter family of instantaneous lorentz frames was only an approximation , as einstein himself points out explicitly@xcite in his 1907 article .",
    "the approximation consists of the fact that the lorentz frames _ never have relativistic velocities _ with respect to one another .",
    "thus einstein approximated a hyperbolic world line in @xmath0 of figure 1 by replacing it with a finite segment having the approximate shape of a parabola .",
    "if einstein had not made this assumption , then he would have found immediately that associated with every uniformly linearly accelerated frame there is a _",
    "twin _ moving into the opposite direction , and causally disjoint from the first . nowadays",
    "these twins are called rindler sectors @xmath0 and @xmath1 as in figure 1 .",
    "thus , _ linearly uniformly accelerated frames always come in pairs _ ,",
    "which ( a ) are causally disjoint and ( b ) have lightlike boundaries , their past and future horizons .",
    "these two rindler coordinatized sectors together with their past @xmath2 and future @xmath3 form a _ _ double - slit interferometer__@xcite relative to a spatially homogeneous but expanding coordinate frame . the two rindler sectors @xmath0 and @xmath1 comprise the double slit portal through which wave fields propagate from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . during this process",
    "the wave field interacts with sources , which due to their acceleration , are confined to , say , rindler sectors @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 .",
    "the interference between the waves coming from these two sectors is observed in @xmath3 . there",
    "the field amplitude is sampled in space and in time .",
    "consider the field which is due to accelerated sources in @xmath0 or in @xmath1 .",
    "a single inertial radio receiver which samples the field temporally is confronted with a metaphysically impossible task : track and decode a signal with a doppler chirp ( time dependent doppler shift ) whose phase is logarithmic in time .",
    "the longer and more violent the acceleration of the source , the more pronounced the initial blueshift and/or the final redshift at the receiver end .",
    "tracking the amplitude and the phase of such a chirped signal becomes a debilitating task for any receiver .",
    "suppose , however , the field gets intercepted by a set of mutually receding radio receivers .",
    "if they , in concert , sample the field spatially at a single instant of `` synchronous '' time , then there is no doppler chirp whatsoever .",
    "an accelerated source which emits a sharp spectral line will produce an equally sharp spectral line in the spatial fourier domain of the sampled space domain ( in figure [ fig : rindler spacetime ] : @xmath4 ) of the expanding set of radio receivers . in brief , _ a signal emitted by an accelerated point source is intercepted by a set of mutually receding phased radio receivers with 100 % fidelity_. we shall refer to this result as the _ fidelity property _ of rindler s spacetime geometry .",
    "the physical reason for this result is given in section [ sec - fidelity : physical ] , the mathematical formulation in section [ sec - fidelity : mathematical ] .",
    "the application of the fidelity property to the power emitted from an accelerated dipole oscillator is given in section [ sec - radiated power ] .",
    "this application consists of larmor s formula@xcite augmented due to the fact that the oscillator is in a state of uniform acceleration .",
    "the fidelity property applies to the radiation from a source accelerated in rindler @xmath0 as well as to a source accelerated in rindler @xmath1 .",
    "if the two sources have the same frequency and are coherent , then the phased array of radio receivers measures an interference pattern which is mathematically indistinguishable from that due to a standard double slit .",
    "this result is spelled out in section [ sec - double slit ] .",
    "it is worth while to reiterate that the fidelity property and its two applications are statements about the rindler coordinate neighborhoods considered jointly , with the event horizons , @xmath5 , integral building blocks of these concepts .",
    "some workers in the field @xcite , who view spacetime only in terms of `` coordinate patches '' or `` coordinate charts '' ( i.e. comply with einstein s approximation mentioned above ) , tend to compare the locus of events @xmath5 in fig .  [",
    "fig : rindler spacetime ] to the coordinate singularity at the north pole of a sphere or the origin of the euclidean plane .",
    "such a comparison leads to a pejorative assessment of rindler s coordinatization as `` imperfect'',``singular '' , or `` poor '' at @xmath6@xcite .",
    "this is unfortunate . as a result",
    ", this comparison diverts attention from the fact that ( 1 ) waves from @xmath0 and @xmath1 interfere in @xmath3 and that ( 2 ) as a consequence , the resulting interference patterns serve as a natural way of probing and measuring scattering and/or radiative sources as well as gravitational disturbances in regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the rindler double - slit opens additional vistas into the role of accelerated frames @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "they accommodate causally disjoint but correlated radiation and scattering centers whose mutually interfering radiation is observed and measured in @xmath3 .",
    "these measurements are mathematically equivalent to having two accelerated observers in rindler @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively . from these measurements",
    "one can reconstruct in all detail the location and temporal evolution of all accelerated radiation sources .",
    "the aggregate of these sources comprises what in euclidean optics is called an object , one in rindler @xmath0 the other in rindler @xmath1 . what is observed in @xmath3",
    "is the interference of two coherent diffraction patterns of these two objects .",
    "these measurements are qualitatively different from those that can be performed in any _ static _ inertial frame .",
    "they yield the kind of information which can be gathered only in accelerated frames with event horizons .",
    "one of the virtues of the rindler double - slit interferometer is that it quite naturally avoids an obvious metaphysical impossibility@xcite , namely , have accelerating observers in rindler sectors @xmath0 and @xmath1 which ( a ) have the physical robustness to withstand the high ( by biological - technological standards ) acceleration and/or ( b ) the longevity and the propulsion resources to co - accelerate for ever and never cross the future event horizon .    from the perspective of implementing measurements",
    ", the rindler double - slit has advantages akin to those of a mach - zehnder interferometer @xcite : it permits an interferometric examination of regions of spacetime whose expanse is spacious enough to accommodate disturbances macroscopic in extent , and it permits one to achieve this feat without putting the measuring apparatus into harm s way .",
    "however , in order to use the rindler interferometer as a diagnostic tool one must first have the necessary conceptual infrastructure .",
    "this article provides four of its ingredients :    * expanding free float frame * fidelity property of the rindler spacetime geometry * augmented larmor formula * double slit interference due to a pair of accelerated sources    _ nomenclature : _ this articlae uses repeatedly the words `` rindler sector '' , `` rindler spacetime '' , etc .",
    "this is verbal shorthand for `` rindler coordinatized sector '' , `` rindler coordinatized spacetime '' etc .",
    "the implicit qualifier `` coordinatized '' is essential because , without it , `` rindler sector / spacetime '' would become a mere floating abstraction , i.e. an idea severed from its observational and/or physical basis .",
    "fundamentally all of physics , including the physics of spacetime , is based on measurements . the class of measurements we shall focus on are those made by `` recording clocks '' @xcite in a state of `` free float '' .",
    "the meaning of a `` recording clock '' is that each one of them consists of    * a clock oscillator which controls the clock and has a standard frequency , * a transmitter whose emission frequency is controlled by this oscillator , * a receiver capable of measuring the emitted radiation from the other recording clocks , even if there is a doppler shift , and * memory chips which can hold data acquired by the receiver .",
    "thus each clock is constructed like one of the gps ( global positioning system ) units orbiting the earth . assuming no gravitation",
    ", one says that the aggregate of recording clocks is in a state of `` free float '' ( inertial motion ) if the relative doppler shift between each pair of such clocks is fixed and constant in time .",
    "there is _ no doppler chirp_. in other words , each recording clock measures ( and stores in its memory ) spectral lines which are sharp .",
    "the sharper the measured spectral lines the more closely the recording clocks are in a state of free float .    from this swarm of freely floating recording clocks one",
    "now forms , by a process of measurement omission , an equivalence class called an `` expanding free float frame '' .",
    "the formation of this concept is achieved by using one of the clocks , say @xmath7 , as a reference clock which measures and collects two kinds of data about all the other clocks , say @xmath8 : doppler shifts and instantaneous distance of @xmath8 from @xmath7 .",
    "doppler shift measurements are frequency measurements .",
    "the emission frequencies of all clocks @xmath8 are the same , say @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the frequencies @xmath10 received and measured by @xmath7 yield the corresponding doppler shift factors @xmath11 for the respective clocks . from these doppler shift factors one obtains the relative velocities @xmath12 between @xmath7 and the respective clocks .",
    "the second kind of measurement is the instantaneous separation .",
    "suppose at some instant of time , say @xmath13 , @xmath7 measures the distances @xmath14 between @xmath7 and the clocks @xmath8 .",
    "one way of doing this is to have @xmath7 operate his transmitter and receiver as a radar device .",
    "we now say that @xmath15 is equivalent to @xmath16 , or more briefly @xmath17 , if @xmath18 it follows that    * @xmath17 implies @xmath19 and * @xmath17 and @xmath20 imply @xmath21 .    by retaining the distinguishing property , the equality of the ratios , eq.([eq : ratios ] ) , while omitting reference to the particular measurements @xmath14 and @xmath22 one forms an equivalence class , the concept `` expanding inertial frame '' .",
    "it should be noted that the reference clock @xmath7 is always a member of this equivalence class .",
    "this is because , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the equivalence condition @xmath25 is satisfied trivially .",
    "the properties of this equivalence class do not depend on the time at which @xmath7 makes the distance measurements and hence not on the value of the ratio @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , if instead of @xmath13 that time had been , say @xmath27 , then the corresponding distance measurements would be @xmath28 , then one would still have a set of equal ratios @xmath29 which would yield the same equivalence class of free float clocks .",
    "the purpose of an inertial reference frame is for a physicist / observer to use its recording clocks to measure time and space displacements .",
    "these measurements consist of establishing quantitative relationships ( typically via counting ) to a standard which serves as a unit . for a time measurement",
    "the unit is the standard interval between any two successive ticks of a clock . for a space measurement",
    "the unit is the ( logarithm of the ) standard doppler shift factor between any pair of nearest neighbor clocks .",
    "thus the array of clocks forms a lattice which is periodic but is expanding uniformly : the recession velocity between any neighboring pair of clocks is one and the same .",
    "this periodicity is an obvious but tacit stipulation in what is meant by `` expanding inertial frame '' . because of this property any one of the recording clocks @xmath8 can play the role of the reference clock @xmath7 , which is to say that the equivalence relation , eq.([eq : ratios ] ) , is independent of the choice of @xmath7 .",
    "the two kinds of measurements which gave rise to the equivalence relation between recording clocks also serve to synchronize their operations .",
    "every clock synchronizes itself to its nearest neighbor by setting its own clock reading to the ratio of ( i ) the nearest neighbor distance and ( ii ) the doppler shift determined velocity .",
    "thus the common ratio , eq.([eq : ratios ] ) , is the synchronous time common to all recording clocks .",
    "this common time has an obvious interpretation : the straight - line extensions into the past of all clock histories intersect simultaneously in a common point .",
    "this is a singular event , which corresponds to @xmath5 .",
    "the common synchronous time of these clocks is the elapsed proper time since then .",
    "however , it is obvious that this singular event is irrelevant for the definition of the expanding inertial frame .",
    "what is relevant instead is the ability of the recording clocks to measure doppler shifts and distances , which presupposes that @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , these clocks might not even have existed until they performed their measurements .",
    "having constructed the spacetime measuring apparatus , we indicate in general terms how to make spacetime measurements of particles and fields .      the mechanical measurements by a physicist / observer of the spacetime properties of a classical particle consists of ( a ) identifying which clock detects the existence of the particle in what interval of synchronous time and ( b ) determining the particle s velocity by measuring its doppler shift .",
    "the first is a counting process in space and time , the second is a counting process in temporal frequency space .    the wave mechanical measurements of the spacetime properties of a classical electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "field consist of using the expanding set of recording clocks to form a _ phased array _ of mutually receding receivers .",
    "this array samples the e.m .",
    "field at the locations of the recording clocks at regular intervals of synchronous time .",
    "the phased array mode involves all clocks at once and thus provides a record of the magnitude and spatial phase of the e.m . field . by repeating this procedure at temporal intervals controlled by the synchronized ticking of the clocks , one obtains a sampled historical record of the magnitude of the field and its temporal phase .",
    "the transfer of information from a transmitter to a receiver , or a system of receivers , depends on being able to establish a one to one correspondence between ( i ) the phase and amplitude of the e.m .",
    "source and ( ii ) the e.m .",
    "signals detected by the observer who mans the receiver(s ) in his frame of reference . for a localized source with a straight worldline that frame is _",
    "static _ and inertial . for a source with a hyperbolic worldline as in figure [ fig : rindler spacetime ]",
    ", it is _ expanding _ and inertial .",
    "signals are detected by having the recording clocks sample and measure the e.m .",
    "field at any fixed synchronous time @xmath31 . except for a @xmath32-dependent amplitude and domain shift , these measured field values ( along the spatial domain @xmath33 )",
    "are precisely the values of the current source ( along the temporal domain @xmath34 ) of the accelerated transmitter@xcite .",
    "geometrically one says that the transmitter signal - function , whose domain is a timelike hyperbola in rindler sector @xmath0 , coincides in essence with the receiver signal function whose domain is a spacelike hyperbola in rindler sector @xmath3 .",
    "thus , if the signal - function is monochromatic at the transmitter end , then so is the signal function on the spatial domain at the receiver end .",
    "_ there is no chirp _ ( changing wave length ) _ in the spatial wave pattern in the expanding inertial frame . _",
    "one arrives at that conclusion by verifying it for wave packets , i.e. for narrow but finite pulses of nearly monochromatic radiation , which make up the e.m . signal .",
    "thus consider a uniformly and linearly accelerated transmitter .",
    "the history of its center of mass is represented by a timelike hyperbola in , say , rindler sector @xmath0 in figure [ fig : rindler spacetime ] .",
    "let us have this single transmitter emit _ two successive _ pulses which have the same mean frequency and require that they be received at the same synchronous time @xmath32 by _ two adjacent _ recording clocks in @xmath3 .",
    "one has therefore two well - defined emission - reception processes , @xmath35 and @xmath36 each starts with a pulse emitted by the accelerated transmitter in rindler sector @xmath0 and ends with the pulse s reception by an inertial recording clock in rindler sector @xmath3 .",
    "both processes end with the simultaneous reception of these pulses in the expanding inertial reference frame . among its recording clocks",
    "there are precisely two , labelled by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which receive pulses @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the first process starts with pulse @xmath15 at event @xmath39 on the timelike hyperbolic world line @xmath40 in rindler sector @xmath0 .",
    "that pulse is launched from the instantaneous lorentz frame @xmath41 centered around this event .",
    "having traced out its world history across the future event horizon of @xmath0 , this pulse ends the first process at event @xmath42 on the spacelike hyperbola of synchronous time @xmath43 there , in the local lorentz frame @xmath44 of the inertial recording clock with label @xmath45 , the ( mean ) wavelength of the pulse is measured and recorded .",
    "the second process starts with pulse @xmath16 emitted at event @xmath46 on the _ same _ timelike hyperbola @xmath40 but at _ different _ rindler time @xmath47 .",
    "this pulse also traces out a world history across the future event horizon .",
    "but the end of this pulse is at @xmath48 on the _ same _ spacelike hyperbola @xmath43 there the ( mean ) wavelength of the pulse gets measured relative the local lorentz frame @xmath49 of the inertial recording clock with _ different _ label @xmath50 .",
    "even though pulses @xmath15 and @xmath16 are emitted sequentially by one and the same transmitter , they are received simultaneously by two different recording clocks .",
    "this is made possible by the fact that the clock labelled by @xmath38 is moving towards the approaching pulse @xmath16 .",
    "the blueshift resulting from this motion precisely compensates the redshift which pulse @xmath16 has relative to @xmath15 _ if _ the recording clock did not have this motion . thus recording clocks @xmath37 and @xmath38 receive pulses @xmath15 and @xmath16 having precisely the same respective frequencies",
    "this agreement is guaranteed by the principle of relativity .",
    "indeed , eq.([eq : process a ] ) is a lorentz transform of ( [ eq : process b ] ) .",
    "each consists of two events , two sets of frame vectors , and a straight pulse history .",
    "the lorentz transformation maps these five entities associated with pulse @xmath15 into those associated with pulse @xmath16 : @xmath51    thus the relative velocity , and hence the doppler shift between frames @xmath52 and @xmath44 , is the same as that between @xmath53 and @xmath49 .",
    "this means that the wavelengths of the two received pulses at clock @xmath54 and clock @xmath55 are the same . there is _ no doppler chirp _ in the composite spatial profile of the received e.m .",
    "field at fixed synchronous time @xmath32 .",
    "if the emitted signal is monochromatic relative to the accelerated transmitter in @xmath0 , then so is the spatial amplitude profile of the received signal relative to the expanding inertial frame in @xmath3 .",
    "the transmission of a sequence of pulses is achieved with 100% fidelity .",
    "this conclusion applies to all wavepackets .",
    "it also applies to any signal .",
    "this is because it is a linear superposition of such packets .",
    "a precise mathematical formulation of the emission of signals and their fidelity in transit from an accelerated source to an expanding inertial frame is developed in section [ sec - fidelity : mathematical ] .",
    "some authors thought that there is some sort of a disconnect between mathematics and physics , in particular between computations and what the computations refer to .",
    "for example , they claimed that `` @xmath56 the coordinates that we use [ for computation ] are arbitrary and have no physical meaning''@xcite or `` it is the very gist of relativity that anybody may use any frame [ in his computations].''@xcite without delving into the epistemological fallacies underlying these claims , one should be aware of their unfortunate consequences .",
    "they tend to discourage attempts to understand natural processes whose very existence and identity one learns through measurements and computations based on nonarbitrary coordinate frames .",
    "the identification of radiation from violently accelerated bodies is a case in point . for these , two complementary frames",
    "are necessary : an accelerated frame to accommodate the source ( rindler sector @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 ) and the corresponding expanding inertial frame ( rindler sector @xmath3 ) to observe the information carried by the radiation coming from this source .",
    "these frames are physically and geometrically distinct from static inertial frames .",
    "they also provide the logical connecting link between the concepts and the perceptual manifestations ( measurements ) of these radiation processes . without these frames",
    "the concepts would not be concepts but mere floating abstractions .",
    "the connecting link between the observed electromagnetic ( e.m . ) field and its source is the maxwell field equations .",
    "the linear acceleration of the source , as well as the relative motion of the expanding set of recording clocks , determine the axis of a cylindrical geometry .",
    "this geometry results in the solutions to the e.m .",
    "field being decomposed into two distinct independently evolving fields the familiar t.m .",
    "polarized field and the t.e . field .",
    "each is based on a single scalar field , which is a scalar under those lorentz transformations which preserve cylindrical symmetry . in particular , the t.m .",
    "( resp . t.e . )",
    "field has vanishing magnetic ( resp .",
    "electric ) but nonzero electric ( resp .",
    "magnetic ) field parallel to the cylinder axis .",
    "finally , there are also the t.e.m . fields .",
    "they are both t.e . and t.m .",
    "at the same time , and they propagate strictly parallel to the cylinder axis .    there is an analogous t.m .- t.e .- t.e.m .",
    "decomposition of the source .",
    "for example , the difference between the t.m . and",
    "fields is that the source of the t.m .",
    "fields is the density of electric multipoles , while the source for the t.e .",
    "fields is the density of magnetic multipoles .",
    "the first task is to solve the inhomogeneous maxwell field equations@xcite and use its solution to determine the radiation properties to be measured .",
    "the best way to set up and solve these equations is to take advantage of the fact the cylindrical symmetry dictates a 2 + 2 decomposition of spacetime into a pair orthogonal 2-dimensional planes , one euclidean , the other lorentzian .",
    "the experienced reader will see that such a decomposition minimizes ( compared to text book treatments ) the amount of mathematical analysis , while simultaneously retaining all physical aspects of the radiation problem .",
    "furthermore , these physical aspects lend themselves to nearly effortless identification because of the flexible curvilinear coordinate systems which the two orthogonal planes accommodate .",
    "however , in order to appreciate the underlying line of reasoning as rapidly as possible , we first illustrate the 2 + 2 decomposition procedure on minkowski spacetime coordinatized with the familiar rectilinear coordinates .",
    "we do this before proceeding to use it to solve maxwell s equations relative to the various rindler coordinates plus polar coordinates as called for by the cylindrical coordinate geometry of linearly accelerating bodies .    in the presence of cylindrical symmetry",
    "the maxwell field equations decouple into two sets , each of which gives rise to its own inhomogeneous scalar wave equation @xmath57 \\psi(t , z , x , y ) = -4\\pi\\ , s(t , z , x , y)~~. \\label{eq : the full equation}\\ ] ] the charge - current four - vector @xmath58 for each set determines and is determined by appropriate derivatives of the scalar source @xmath59 .",
    "similarly , the vector potential @xmath60 as well as the electromagnetic field @xmath61 determine and are determined by the scalar wave function @xmath62 with the result that the maxwell field equations @xmath63 are satisfied whenever the wave eq.([eq : the full equation ] ) is satisfied .      for the t.e .",

    "consequently , the criterion for `` violence '' is that @xmath289 when this condition is fulfilled , the larmor contribution to the radiation is eclipsed by the rindler contribution .",

    "fields of a dipole source accelerated in rindler sector @xmath0 : the augmented larmor formula implies that the dipole emits radiation if and only if its @xmath193-momentum , the spatial integral of @xmath292 in the expanding inertial frame , is non - zero .",

    "the requirement that signals be transmitted with 100% fidelity implies that the spacetime arena for this radiation process consist of two adjacent rindler coordinatized sectors , such as @xmath0 and @xmath3 or @xmath1 and @xmath3 .    the unifying perspective applied to two adjacent rindler sectors",
    "is brought into a particularly sharp focus by the augmented larmor formula , eqs.([eq : larmor s formula ] ) or ( [ eq : larmor s electric dipole formula ] ) .",
    "this is because the physical basis of this formula is a radiation process which starts in one of the two rindler sectors and ends in the other .",
    "indeed , the radiative longitudinal momentum ( longitudinal flow of radiative energy ) observed and measured in the expanding inertial frame in @xmath3 is expressed directly in terms of the behaviour of the dipole source in the accelerated frame in @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) .",

    "there the oscillations constitute a source for the scattered radiation which propagates into @xmath3 . the other partial wave , which propagates through rindler sector @xmath1 , also reaches @xmath3 . there",
    "the resultant interference pattern is observed and measured .",
    "it is evident that this interference pattern is made possible by the properties of the four rindler sectors combined , the rindler interferometer of section [ the rindler interferometer ] .",
    "thus both the rindler interferometer and the augmented larmor formula provide a unifying perspective .",
    "it joins adjacent rindler coordinate charts into a single spacetime arena for radiation and scattering processes from accelerated bodies .",
    "this perspective is at variance with a philosophy which seeks a particle - antiparticle definition in non - rectilinear coordinate systems in flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "such a philosophy typically focuses on one of the rindler charts to the exclusion of all the others .",
    "the application of quantum field theory to such a chart leads to the paradox of spurious particle production in flat spacetime . as a result quantum theory remains meaningfully invariant only under a subset of",
    "classically allowed coordinate transformations .",
    "a proposed solution is to disallow  in quantum theory  a large class of coordinate transformations , such as those leading to rindler charts @xmath3 or @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , the fault does not lie with these rindler charts .",
    "instead , it lies with the underlying philosophy which seeks a definition of the particle - antiparticle concept in one of the coordinate charts while ignoring reference to the others .",
    "such a selective focus does not comply with , and hence is forbidden by the unifying perspective implied by the augmented larmor formula and by the rindler double - slit interferometer .",
    "the subject of this article is the physics of accelerated frames .",
    "the theme is : `` how does one observe and measure the properties of violently accelerated bodies ? '' answering this question has led to three results .",
    "first of all , suppose one considers the transmission of e.m .",
    "signals from a translationally accelerated transmitter to a receiver in an inertial frame .",
    "one finds that the signals can be transmitted without any time dependent doppler distortion and with 100% fidelity _ provided _ the signals are received in an inertial frame which is _",
    "expanding_. a static inertial frame would not do .",
    "second , larmor s radiation formula for the radiation intensity from a dipole source gets augmented if that dipole is subjected to linear uniform acceleration . under this circumstance",
    "the total radiation is the sum of the magnetic and electric dipole radiation , @xmath293 + \\frac{2}{3}\\left [               \\left(\\frac{d^2 \\textbf{m}}{dt'^2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{\\xi'^2}\\left(\\frac{d \\textbf{m}}{dt'}\\right)^2 \\right ]              \\right\\}~. \\label{eq : larmor 's magnetic and electric dipole formula}\\ ] ] the amount of that augmentation becomes dominant when the acceleration is so large that its `` fermi - walker '' length ( @xmath294/acceleration ) is smaller than the wavelength of the emitted radiation , or equivalently , when eq.([eq : the criterion ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "finally , taking note of the fact that for every source accelerated to the right there is a twin source accelerated to the left , suppose these two sources are irradiated coherently . then these twins together with their concomitant expanding inertial reference frame form an interferometer .",
    "more precisely , the four rindler coordinatized sectors form an interferometer , the rindler interferometer .",
    "its geometrical arena consists of the rindler sectors @xmath295 as exhibited in figure [ fig : rindler spacetime ] .",
    "they accommodate what in euclidean space would be the components of an optical interferometer with ( i ) @xmath2 serving as the beam splitter , ( ii ) the spacetimes of the two accelerated frames @xmath0 and @xmath1 serving as the two arms , and ( iii ) the spacetime @xmath3 serving as the beam re - combiner .",
    "the interference pattern is recorded by the expanding inertial frame in @xmath3 .",

    "consequently , integration by parts yields @xmath310 and @xmath311 thus there remain only three non - zero terms in the integral , @xmath312 the coefficients of the squared terms are @xmath313 we now take advantage of the fact that the integral , eq.([eq : integral with three terms ] ) , is independent of the synchronous time @xmath32 .",
    "this simplifies the evaluation of the integral considerably because one may assume @xmath314 without changing the value of the integral .",
    "the final outcome is that ( i ) in each of the expressions , eqs.([eq:1st expression])-([eq:3rd expression ] ) , only the last term contributes to the @xmath212-integral and ( ii ) the integral assumes a simple mathematical form if one introduces @xmath315 as the new integration variable . with this scheme",
    "one has @xmath316 the to - be - used integrands have the form @xmath317 both of which are always less than one in absolute value , even when they get multiplied by @xmath318 .",

    "one finds that @xmath320 the value of the integral @xmath321 implies that the final result is @xmath322 the total momentum into the @xmath193-direction radiated by a magnetic dipole accelerated in rindler sector @xmath0 ( upper sign ) or in rindler sector @xmath1 ( lower sign ) .",

    "the other breakthrough was , of course , his focus on the `` principle of the uniqueness of free fall '' ( `` eotvos property '' ) , which he identified as a manifestation of his `` equivalence hypothesis '' according to which a body s acceleration in a static gravitational field is merely a kinematical effect due to accelerated reference frame relative to which the body is observed .",
