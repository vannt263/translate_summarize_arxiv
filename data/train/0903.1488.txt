    "our aim in this note is to derive that result by contact topological means .",
    "the main ingredients are the classification of contact structures on @xmath0 up to isotopy , a result of colin about isotopies of @xmath12-spheres in contact @xmath9-manifolds , and a theorem of giroux concerning the space of contact elements on @xmath13 and its contactomorphism group .",

    "the final result of this legendrian isotopy will be a legendrian knot whose front projection has no crossings , but which now winds several times around the right - hand attaching ball in the @xmath86-plane .",
    "one can bring the knot back into standard form ( and still no crossings in the front projection ) as follows : perform a move of type  6 to introduce a single kink in the front projection ; then remove the kink with a legendrian reidemeister move of the first kind ( see figure  [ figure : kink ] ) ; each such move reduces the ( absolute ) winding number of the front projection of @xmath114 around the right - hand ball .",
    "positive and negative stabilisations can then be removed in pairs by a further application of the light bulb trick , as shown in figure  [ figure : lightbulb2 ] .",

    "thus , @xmath190 where @xmath191 stands for the component of the contractible loop in the loop space of  @xmath192 .",
    "now , @xmath193 , and the generators of @xmath194 and @xmath195 in the above factorisation of @xmath189 can be realised as loops of contactomorphisms @xmath196,\\ ] ] and @xmath197,\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "thus , the homotopy exact sequence becomes @xmath198 the proposition follows .",
    "in @xcite , fraser described an infinite family of legendrian knots in the contact manifold @xmath199 all of which have the same topological knot type and the same classical invariants @xmath200 and @xmath201 , but which are nonetheless pairwise not legendrian isotopic .",
    "the idea for distinguishing these knots is to perform legendrian surgery on them ( or contact @xmath172-surgery in the language of  @xcite ) , and then to observe that the contact structures on the surgered manifold ( which happens to be the @xmath9-torus  @xmath202 ) are pairwise not isotopic .",
    "this argument , in our view , is incomplete because it hinges on the statement `` legendrian surgery on legendrian isotopic knots produces isotopic contact structures on the surgered manifold ''  which is meaningless , as we want to explain .",
    "suppose you have two legendrian isotopic knots @xmath203 , @xmath204 in a contact @xmath9-manifold @xmath120 .",
    "the legendrian isotopy extends to a contact isotopy @xmath205 , @xmath206 $ ] , of @xmath120 with @xmath207 . for each @xmath206",
    "$ ] , the contactomorphism @xmath205 of @xmath120 induces a contactomorphism between the contact manifold @xmath208 obtained by legendrian surgery along @xmath203 and the contact manifold @xmath209 obtained by legendrian surgery along @xmath210 .",
    "but there is no way , in general , to identify @xmath208 with @xmath209 ( even as mere differential manifolds ) other than with the diffeomorphism induced by  @xmath205 .",
    "so we obtain a parametric family of contact manifolds , all of which are contactomorphic , but not an isotopy of contact structures on a fixed differential manifold .    in fact , in situations where there is a canonical way of identifying the surgered manifolds ,",
    "the statement in question is false , in general .",
    "this is illustrated by the following example from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercise 11.3.12  ( c ) ) , see figure  [ figure : twosharks ] .",
    "contact @xmath172-surgery on the ` shark ' in @xmath171 with its mouth on the left or on the right corresponds topologically to a surgery on the unknot with surgery coefficient @xmath211 relative to the surface framing .",
    "if we take the obvious topological identification of the shark with the unknot , this allows us to identify the surgered manifold in both cases with the lens space @xmath212 . with respect to this identification",
    ", the two resulting contact structures on the surgered manifold @xmath212 can be distinguished via their induced spin@xmath213 structure , so they are not isotopic .",
    "( under the identification in question , which gives the two sharks the same , say the counter - clockwise orientation , the shark on the left has @xmath214 , the one on the right , @xmath215 .",
    "this implies that the corresponding spin@xmath213 structures have first chern class @xmath216 ; see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "however , there is a legendrian isotopy from one shark to the other ( reversing its orientation ) , and this induces a contactomorphism of the surgered contact manifolds  it is simply the contactomorphism induced by the contactomorphism @xmath217 relating the two contact surgery diagrams .",
    "thus , if one wants to show with the help of legendrian surgery that two legendrian knots @xmath219 can not be legendrian isotopic , one has to require , in general , that the surgered contact manifolds are not contactomorphic . in fraser s set - up , unfortunately , the surgered manifolds happen to be contactomorphic by construction .",
    "nonetheless , we now want to show that fraser s idea can be made to work .",
    "in fact , the examples we are going to discuss presently are explicit realisations of the knots described only implicitly by fraser .",
    "figure [ figure : fraser ] shows a family @xmath220 , @xmath112 , of legendrian knots in @xmath221 ; for @xmath222 , the zig - zags are to be interpreted as @xmath223 pairs of zig - zags in the opposite direction .",
    "observe that @xmath224 , where @xmath16 is regarded as a contactomorphism acting only on the upper ( in the picture ) summand @xmath0  there is a realisation of @xmath16 that fixes a disc and hence is compatible with taking the connected sum .",
    "all these knots have the same topological knot type , as can be shown by applying the topological light bulb trick .",
    "moreover , the well - known formul  for computing the classical invariants  which take the same form for a legendrian knot in ` standard form ' in @xmath221 as in @xmath171 , see  @xcite  give @xmath225 and @xmath226 for all @xmath112 ( for either orientation of those knots ) .",
    "arguing by contradiction , let us assume that there are two legendrian isotopic knots @xmath230 and @xmath231 , with @xmath232 .",
    "then @xmath233 and @xmath234 , where @xmath235 , will be legendrian isotopic . since @xmath224 , this implies that @xmath236 is contact isotopic to a contactomorphism of @xmath221 that fixes  @xmath203 . by lemma  [ lem : nbhd ] , @xmath236 is then contact isotopic to a contactomorphism @xmath237 that fixes a neighbourhood @xmath238 of  @xmath203 .",

    "first of all , the homomorphism @xmath243 induced by inclusion is surjective ; this follows from the cell structure of stein manifolds .",
    "secondly , the @xmath30-fibres must lie in the kernel of this homomorphism , otherwise one could pass to a cover and obtain a stein filling of the contact structure @xmath244 for some  @xmath245 , which is impossible by a result of eliashberg  @xcite .    in the proof of the cancellation lemma given in @xcite it is shown explicitly that the belt sphere of the surgery is legendrian isotopic , in the surgered manifold , to a legendrian push - off of  @xmath203 .",
    "alternatively , we can isotope it to a standard legendrian meridian of  @xmath203 , as shown in ( * ? ? ?",

    "we now want to show that this standard legendrian meridian is in fact _",
    "isotopic to the @xmath30-fibre @xmath246 in @xmath247 . for this",
    "we appeal to the classification of linear legendrian curves in @xmath247 by ghiggini  @xcite .",
    "the thurston ",
    "bennequin invariant @xmath248 can be defined for such linear legendrian curves @xmath152 as the twisting of the contact structure relative to an incompressible torus containing  @xmath152 .",

    "this is the maximal @xmath200 in the topological knot type of @xmath246 ; see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "the definition of the rotation number @xmath201 for linear legendrian curves in @xmath247 depends on the choice of trivialisation of  @xmath242 , but it can be normalised so that @xmath252 for curves realising the maximal  @xmath200 . according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.5 ) , the classical invariants suffice to classify legendrian realisations of the topological knot type of @xmath246 .",
    "so all we have to show is that the standard legendrian meridian @xmath253 of @xmath203 has @xmath254 in the surgered manifold , i.e.  in @xmath247 .",
    "now , @xmath253 bounds a disc in @xmath89 . with respect to",
    "the framing given by that disc in  @xmath89 , the contact structure makes one negative twist along  @xmath253 ( since @xmath253 is a standard legendrian unknot in @xmath89 with @xmath254 ) . a close inspection of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example  4.6.5 ) shows that the framing which @xmath253 inherits from the meridional disc , now regarded as a framing of @xmath253 in  @xmath202 , is the same it inherits from an incompressible torus , whence it follows that @xmath255 also in the surgered manifold @xmath247 .",
    "( for that last statement about framings , imagine @xmath89 being cut in a plane passing through the attaching balls of one of the @xmath88-handles , and with the attaching balls for the second @xmath88-handle symmetric to this plane .",
    "then , in the @xmath12-sphere cut out by this plane , a circle around one of the attaching balls  that ball being seen as a disc in this @xmath12-sphere  defines  @xmath253 up to isotopy .",
    "the @xmath12-sphere with two discs removed , together with a cylinder contained in the boundary of the @xmath88-handle , is an incompressible torus in the surgered manifold , containing  @xmath253 . )    as a check for consistency , we observe that because of @xmath249 in @xmath247 , contact @xmath170-surgery along such a fibre , which brings us back to @xmath221 by the cancellation lemma , is topologically a surgery with framing given by the product structure of  @xmath202 , and that does indeed produce  @xmath256 .",
    "if we perform the surgery along @xmath203 inside the neighbourhood @xmath238 , the fact that the belt sphere of the surgery is @xmath246 ( up to legendrian isotopy ) implies that we have a contactomorphism between @xmath257 and @xmath258 for some neighbourhood @xmath259 of  @xmath246 .",
    "it follows that the contactomorphism @xmath237 of @xmath221 , which fixes @xmath238 , induces a contactomorphism of @xmath247 that fixes @xmath259 .",

    "a concrete legendrian realisation @xmath264 of such a loop is shown in figure  [ figure:3torus ] , where @xmath246 is taken to be the fibre over @xmath265 .",
    "we take @xmath266 ( oriented by @xmath267 , cooriented by  @xmath268 ) ; its legendrian lift @xmath264 coincides with  @xmath269 .",

    "when projected to @xmath261 , this defines a homotopy between @xmath269 and the projection @xmath280 of @xmath279 .    if we write @xmath281 for the diffeomorphism of @xmath261 whose lift is @xmath237 , then @xmath282 , so @xmath280 is a simple closed curve in @xmath261 homotopic to  @xmath269 . by baer",
    "s theorem , see  @xcite , there is an isotopy of @xmath261 , identical near the boundary , that moves @xmath280 back to  @xmath269 ( with the original orientation , for homological reasons ) .",
    "the lift of this isotopy is a contact isotopy of @xmath258 , fixed near the boundary , that moves @xmath279 back to  @xmath264 .",
