    "agn have first been discovered in the radio and soon after searched in the optical band .",
    "consequently , they have been classified using their optical characteristics and mainly divided into two categories : type 1 ( agn1 ) and 2 ( agn2 ) according to the presence or not of broad emission lines in their optical spectra ( we will keep this definition of agn1 throughout this paper ) .    before the advent of the last generation of hard x - ray telescopes , agn samples where predominantly based on agn1 selected either in the optical or , later on , in the soft x - rays by _",
    "einstein _ and _ rosat_. in these bands",
    "the evolution of agn1 has been well measured ( see e.g. della ceca et al . 1992 ; boyle et al . 2000 ; miyaji , hasinger , & schmidt 2000 ) . on the contrary",
    "the production of samples of agn2 has been difficult at any wavelength and limited to few local surveys .",
    "the general picture was in favor of a model in which agn1 objects were associated to agn with low absorption in the hard x - rays while agn2 to obscured sources with large column densities and spectra strongly depressed in the soft x - rays , as expected in the unification models ( e.g. antonucci 1993 ) .    in the last decade the advent of the _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ satellites",
    "has allowed for the first time the detection and identification of agn as the main counterparts of hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - ray sources down to fluxes @xmath14 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 , more than 2 orders of magnitude fainter than _ heao1 _",

    "these identifications accounted for about 30% of the 2 - 10 kev hard x - ray background ( ueda et al .",
    "1998 ; fiore et al .",
    "recently the new generation of x - ray satellites such as _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , have reached fluxes 100 times fainter , identifying hundreds of sources and almost resolving the hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - ray background ( e.g. mushotzky et al . 2000 ; fiore et al .",

    "thanks to their excellent angular resolution ( @xmath11 - 5@xmath15 ) , the first spectroscopic identifications projects have been able to observe faint ( i@xmath123 ) optical counterparts . at variance with the classical type-1/type-2 model in the optical ,",
    "a significant number of the counterparts ( @xmath130% ) resulted to be apparently optical normal galaxies , with x - ray luminosities @xmath16@xmath10@xmath17 erg s@xmath4 typical of agn activity , and moreover part of the optical type 1 agns resulted to be absorbed in the hard x - rays ( see e.g. fiore et al .",

    "these observations have complicated the picture of the agn model . in this framework",
    "the computation of the density of agn has become an even more difficult task .",
    "in fact , it is not clear how to classify the sources and to take into account the selection biases introduced by the observation in the 2 - 10 kev range , where the absorption still play a relevant role .    these recent deep surveys with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have reached fluxes @xmath1 @xmath18 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4(2 - 10 kev ) in quite small areas ( less than 1 deg@xmath19 ) . as a consequence these surveys are not able to provide statistical significant samples at brighter fluxes ( @xmath20 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ; 5 - 10 kev ) where the density of sources is about 5/deg@xmath19 ( fiore et al .",

    "we present an analysis of the evolution of agn in the 2 - 10 kev band . because of the reasons previously described , the selection and definition of type 2/absorbed sources is still not clear , and thus we restricted our evolutionary studies to type 1 agn only .",

    "we have spectroscopically identified 36 out of the 49 hellas sources whose field has been investigated at the telescopes . for 13 sources we have found no optical counterparts brighter than the chosen magnitude limits ( see discussion above ) .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of the new generation x - ray telescopes ( _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ) would probably allow an unambiguous identification of the counterparts of these hellas sources , but in the framework of this work these fields have been declared _ empty_. these sources have harder x - ray spectra than the total sample .",

    "therefore , taken at a face value , the match between the soft and hard x - rays lfs implies that agn1 have a broad band concave spectrum getting steeper going toward lower energies .",
    "as already discussed in the previous section , the ( @xmath12,@xmath13)=(0.3,0.7 ) cosmology for agn1 alone has not been analyzed by miyaji et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the agreement of the evolution measured in the soft and hard x - rays is also shown in figure 12 , where the evolution of the density of agn1 brighter than logl@xmath93=44.8 is shown .",
    "the soft x - ray data from miyaji et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have been over - plotted assuming a slope @xmath52 , which corresponds to a limit logl@xmath106(0.5 - 2 kev)@xmath11744.5 .",
    "the continuous line are the predictions of our ldde model for ( @xmath12,@xmath13)=(1.0,0.0 ) .    based on observations collected at the european southern observatory , chile , eso n@xmath124 : 62.p-0783 , 63.o-0117(a ) , 64.o-0595(a ) , 65.o-0541(a ) .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "this research has been partially supported by asi contract ars-99 - 75 , murst grants cofin-98 - 02 - 32 , cofin-99 - 034 , cofin-00 - 02 - 36 and a 1999 cnaa grant .",
    "as already described , 25 sources have been identified by cross - correlation with existing catalogues . however , as the sample is not fully spectroscopic identified , the cross - correlation with the existing catalogues could alter the average characteristics ( fluxes , percentages of classes of counterparts , etc . ) of the subsample of identified sources .",
    "namely , the subsample could not be representative of the whole sample .",
    "let s explain this with an example . in an ideal sample of 50 agn1 and 50 agn2 a random identification of a subsample of 40 sources will identify about 50@xmath26 agn1 and 50@xmath26 agn2 according to sampling errors .",
    "but if a cross - correlation is first made with a catalogue of only agn1 ( let say 30 ) and later only 10 sources are randomly identified , the fraction of agn1 in the total identified subsample of 40 sources will be artificially increased ( they will be at minimum 75@xmath26 ) . our subsample is risking the same sort of bias , and we wish to quantify it .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) two - sample test gives a 9@xmath26 probability that the x - ray flux distribution of the 25 sources identified through the cross - correlation with catalogues belong to the same parent population of the total sample of 118 sources .",
    "although not significant , this low probability is due to the average slightly brighter fluxes of the cross - correlated subsample ( @xmath125 ) in comparison to the total sample ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "we have thus tried to populate the faintest bins during the observing runs at the telescope , and , indeed , the ks test gives a 66@xmath26 probability that the whole subsample of the 74 identified sources ( included the empty fields ) belong to the same parent population of the total sample of 118 sources ( see figure 1 ) .    in this way ,",
    "our observing runs at the telescope have recovered the possible alteration on the fraction of classes of sources which are identified . as the catalogues used for the cross correlation",
    "are mainly populated by agn1 ( we used ned ) , their fraction in our sample , as explained before , could be artificially increased .",
    "agn1 are 14 out of the 25 cross - correlated sources ( 56@xmath26 ) .",
    "the fraction of agn1 is , as expected ( but not significantly ) , lower for the sources observed at the telescope : 23 out of the 49 ( 47@xmath26 ) .",
    "the two values are not statistically distinguishable from the observed fraction 50@xmath26 of agn1 in the whole sample , which we thus consider representative of the whole hellas sample .",
