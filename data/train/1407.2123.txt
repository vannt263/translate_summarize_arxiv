    "asteroseismology aims to understand the structure and evolution of stars by examining their oscillation modes @xcite . among the classical pulsators , @xmath4  scuti stars , which are located at the intersection of the cepheid instability strip and the main sequence , where the stellar structure transits from a highly developed outer convective zone to its absence @xcite , are rather common .",
    "they pulsate with amplitudes from milimagnitudes up to tenths of a magnitude @xcite , but only a fraction of the theoretically predicted modes are observed , which results in many free parameters in the pulsation models .",
    "it is therefore important to infer some of the fundamental stellar properties of these pulsators from other methods , like for example by studying the pulsating components in binary ( multiple ) systems . in this kind of systems it is possible to characterize precisely their components , supplying additional constraints for a more reliable modelling .",
    "about 70% of all stars in the solar neighbourhood are members of binary or multiple systems ( @xmath5 60 - 70% for late - type stars",
    "@xcite , @xmath5 70 - 80% for early - type stars",
    "this fact is usually ignored in the study of stellar pulsations although there is strong evidence that binarity might affect the pulsation properties in specific cases ( e.g. the eccentric binaries hd 177863 @xcite , hd  209295 @xcite and kic  4544587 @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus essential to understand the possible link(s ) between binarity and pulsation @xcite .",
    "recent studies point to the fact that single and binary - member @xmath4  scuti stars can show different behaviour because of their different evolutionary status @xcite . @xcite",
    "introduced the _ oscillating eclipsing algols _ ( oeas ) as main sequence pulsators in semi - detached algol - type eclipsing binary systems . for several of these systems , they found variable pulsational characteristics which could be related to mass transfer episodes or tidal distortions .",
    "several surveys have been carried out in the last years to increase the number of known objects of this type .",
    "@xcite compiled a catalogue of close eclipsing binary systems ( detached and semi - detached ones ) with one @xmath4  scuti component .",
    "@xcite made a compilation of 190 oscillating eclipsing binaries ( 60 of them containing a @xmath4  scuti component ) and more than 370 pulsating binary or multiple stellar systems .",
    "@xcite published a catalogue with 74 eclipsing binaries with a @xmath4  scuti component , and this number is increasing at a very rapid rate thanks to the results of _ most _ @xcite , _ corot _ @xcite and _ kepler _ @xcite .",

    "a detailed follow - up study of the physical properties of dy  aqr , an algol - type binary with its primary component showing @xmath4  scuti oscillations , has been performed , by combining optical photometry obtained with omc and the 90-cm telescope at the observatorio de sierra nevada ( osn , granada , spain ) , with high - resolution spectra taken with the hermes instrument on the mercator telescope at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( orm , la palma , spain ) ) . in sect .",

    "the three types of eclipsing binaries in table [ table3_1 ] : algol ( ea ) , @xmath7 lyrae ( eb ) and w ursae majoris ( ew ) , correspond to the classification in the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs ; @xcite ) , adopted in the vsx , and is based purely on the shape of the light curves .",

    "as mentioned above , dy  aqr was identified as an eclipsing binary system containing a @xmath4-scuti by @xcite . in that work a frecuency of 23.39 c / d and an semi - amplitude of 0.006 mag were measured .    with omc data the pulsational frecuency of 23.39 c / d found by @xcite",
    "is confirmed with a semi - amplitude of 0.005 mag , in agreement with the value they measured .",
    "however , with omc data , two more frequencies at 19.56 c / d and semi - amplitude 0.014 mag and at 20.19 c / d and semi - amplitude 0.013 mag were found , being more significant than the previously reported one . this could be an indication of mode amplitude variations with time . in order to check if this was a real change in the pulsation characteristics of dy  aqr , we analised separately the strmgren multi - colour photometry .",
    "the frequencies found at each filter are summarized in table  [ tabla3_4 ] .",
    "we considered a peak to be significant if its s / n ratio is larger than 4.0 .",

    ", we also performed the frequency analysis with sigspec @xcite and the agreement between the two methods was good .",
    "we did not find any evidence from the analysis of the osn data of the two additional frequencies detected in the omc lightcurve .",
    "if we compare our results with the values reported by @xcite , we conclude that no obvious amplitude variation is detected for the frequency of 23.39 c / d .",
    "we have analysed any potential instrumental effects that could explain the other frequencies detected in the omc data , but none of them is able to justify these frequencies .",
    "moreover , they appear in two different epochs , separated by one year .",
    "we plan to continue monitoring dy  aqr in the future looking for potential short - lived instabilities affecting its pulsation modes .",
    "it is known that stars in close binary systems evolve in a different way than isolated stars do .",
    "several mass - luminosity relations ( mlrs ) for eclipsing binaries have been obtained in the last years @xcite .",
    "one of the main conclusions of these studies is that the systems with spectral type a and f have higher luminosities ( radii ) and temperatures than single stars with the same spectral type @xcite .",
    "this fact is in good agreement with the results we obtained in our binary modelling .",

    "[ fig : liakos ] the parameters of dy  aqr are represented in similar plots as those shown by @xcite .",
    "it can be seen in the figure that dy  aqr behaves indeed as other semi - detached systems , which is consistent with our results , althought the difference between detached and semi - detached behaviour is not very evident in these plots .",
    "furthermore , the bottom panel of this figure shows that dy  aqr is not very evolved yet , being located close to the zams in the diagram .    on the other hand , @xcite derived the following theoretical relation between the pulsation and orbital periods of pulsating stars in close binaries , based on their roche lobe filling :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 being the pulsation constant @xmath11 , @xmath12 the filling factor , @xmath13 the equivalent radius of the roche lobe calculated from @xcite , and @xmath14 the mass ratio .    fitting this equation to all the data they collected , they obtained the numerical relation : @xmath15    which is very similar to the fit derived by @xcite for semi - detached systems , as shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : liakos ] .    applying the results obtained in this work , we derived for dy  aqr that @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and q = 0.019  d. this value of the pulsation constant indicates that dy  aqr pulsates in p - modes , which is expected for a @xmath4  scuti .",
    "if we use the orbital and pulsational periods of dy  aqr , we get @xmath18 , which is in perfect agreement with equation [ eq : alfa ] .",

    "we have performed a detailed analysis of one of the systems , dy  aqr , poorly studied in the past , and for which we had identified with omc a possible change in the fundamental pulsational frequencies .",
    "episodic mass - transfer events in these objects can indeed affect their pulsational characteristics .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy with hermes / mercator classifies the primary component of dy  aqr as an a7.5  v star , much cooler than previously reported .",
    "the o - c diagram does not show any evidence of orbital period changes .",
    "binary modelling with phoebe combining the multicolour photometric ligth curves ( omc and osn ) and the radial velocity curve of the primary component ( hermes / mercator ) constraints the primary component to an effective temperature of @xmath19  k and @xmath1 and the secondary component to an effective temperature of @xmath20  k and @xmath21 .",
    "the detection of the spectrum of the secondary component would provide a better determination of the physical parameters of each component , but the secondary contribution was below the limit of detection in our data .",
    "after removing the binarity effect from the light curves , the pulsational frequencies were studied through fourier analysis .",
    "we did not confirm with the osn data the first and second frequencies detected by omc at 19.56 and 20.19 c / d . on the other hand ,",
    "the same fundamental frequency found by @xcite at 23.39 c / d , also detected by omc , was present in this ground - based photometry .",
    "the detection of these 2 additional frequencies by omc can not be attributed to known instrumental effects , and point to a drastic , short - lived change in the pulsational characteristics .",
    "a further monitoring would be required to confirm short lived pulsational instabilities in this star .",
    "the physical parameters obtained for each component of dy  aqr in the binary modelling are in agreement with the expected evolution of the components of a semi - detached algol - system as given by @xcite .",
    "finally , our conclusion of dy  aqr being an oea is compatible with the results by @xcite and @xcite on how the mass - transfer in these systems affects their pulsational behaviour , but the detection of the secondary spectrum will be necessary to accurately determine the physical parameters of the system .",
