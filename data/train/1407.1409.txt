    "anomalous raman scattering , characterised by surprisingly strong features in the multi - order scattering , and with intensities comparable to the one - phonon scattering , seems to be a general property of rare - earth ( @xmath3 ) manganites @xmath3mno@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is directly related to a problem of the existence of a new type of elementary excitation  an orbital wave excitation  or a new particle called `` orbiton '' in the correlated electron systems with broken symmetry @xcite .",
    "usually , an orbital excitation is associated with an energy gap , induced in the two - fold degenerate electronic @xmath4 levels of mn@xmath2 ions by electron superexchange ( se ) interaction @xcite and/or jahn - teller ( jt ) electron - lattice interaction @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , an uncertainty in parameters of superexchange interaction , particularly in the mott  hubbard value @xmath5 from one side , and in the jt energy @xmath6 from the other side , is still a challenge for theoreticians and it is not yet clear where the orbitons should be looked for in measurements . in a limit of weak jt coupling , the orbital excitations in lamno@xmath0 are predicted to appear around 1600 @xmath1 ( 0.2 ev ) , as a result of the superexchange interaction @xcite , which indicates on the feature , observed in the second - order raman scattering experiment in the 9001400 @xmath1 ( 0.110.17 ev ) range @xcite . if the contributions from se and jt effects are considered on equal footing , the elementary excitations of the system , according to the theory predictions , are mixed modes with both phonon and orbital character , and the phonon - orbital excitations appear as franck ",
    "condon sidebands at energy intervals of the jahn  teller vibrational energy @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in a limit of strong jt coupling , and strong electronic correlations at @xmath7 , the orbitons in lamno@xmath0 could be self - trapped excitons with energy @xmath6 ; then the anomalous raman scattering could be interpreted as a result of multiphonon scattering , induced by the resonant optical excitation of 2 ev across the large jt gap , and activated by the franck - condon process @xcite . however , in our comprehensive experimental ( ellipsometry ) and theoretical studies of lamno@xmath0 , we argue that the optical excitation at 2 ev is an intersite @xmath8 transition , governed by superexchage interaction , and evaluate the effective mott - hubbard parameter @xmath5=3.1@xmath90.2 ev @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "it is argued by iliev _",
    "_ that the oxygen isotope substitution effect in the rare - earth manganites @xmath3mno@xmath0 provides strong evidence that the multi - order raman spectra are of pure phonon character , rather than of orbiton or mixed orbiton - phonon character , and that the multi - order scattering has predominantly the oxygen phonon density - of - states ( pdos ) origin @xcite .",
    "these interpretations of the anomalous raman scattering in rare - earth manganites @xmath3mno@xmath0 are ambiguous and are a subject of intense debate , questioning the roles of the jt electron - lattice and/or se interactions . moreover ,",
    "even the existence of orbital excitations in these correlated systems with broken symmetry is still unproven experimentally or theoretically .",
    "as it was shown in the earlier study by sarfatt and stoneham @xcite , and in exact agreement with the prediction of the goldstone theorem @xcite , octahedral complexes of cu@xmath10 ( and mn@xmath2 ) ions represent striking illustration of the system with broken symmetry , where an excitation branch should exist , which frequency tends to zero in the limit of infinite wavelengths . the nature of the goldstone mode in octahedral complexes of cu@xmath10 ( and mn@xmath2 ) ions , in the way noted by sarfatt - stoneham @xcite ,",
    "is associated with the rotation by angle @xmath11 going round the rim at the minimum of a double - valued `` mexican hat '' energy surface @xcite .",
    "this rotation is characteristic of the pure `` mexican hat '' limit , and corresponds to oscillations in the configuration of octahedral complexes , determined by the partial occupation of the electronic @xmath4 orbitals .",
    "this  should result in acoustic orbital wave propagation from relative motions of different ions , where close ions have similar phases @xmath11 .",
    "when the electron - lattice coupling can be considered infinite , additional terms in the lagrangian , such as anharmonicity , could destroy the broken symmetry and the the zero - point motion round the rim at the minimum of the `` mexican hat '' .",
    "in such a case , the ground state is often determined by several energetically equivalent wells , and in the static case the system is confined to one of them .",
    "however , if the coupling is finite , fluctuations between the energetically equivalent wells of the distorted geometry lead to the tunneling states @xcite .",
    "let us consider the model materials , lamno@xmath0 and kcuf@xmath0 , for a cooperative jt effect , which also exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering ( at @xmath12 of 140 k and 39 k , respectively ) due to heisenberg - type exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "in a recent optical study of kcuf@xmath0 with orbital ordering temperature of @xmath13 k , a new temperature scale @xmath14 , characterised by the emergence of sharp absorption features due to the on - site @xmath8 transitions , followed by a sideband of magnon excitations , correlating with changes in the orbital ordering @xcite prior to the magnetic ordering , has been established @xcite .",
    "the sideband excitations were ascribed to the zone - boundary magnons ( or their combinations ) , which became optically - active via exchange - induced dipole mechanism .",
    "it was suggested that a dynamic distortion of the environment of the cu@xmath10 ions becomes static below @xmath15 k , which leads to a symmetry change , affects the orbital ordering , and paves the way for the antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "simultaneously , the phonon modes , involving the displacement of f@xmath16 ions , soften with decreasing temperature @xcite .",
    "similarly , lamno@xmath0 , with orbital ordering temperature of @xmath17 k , exhibits changes in the orbital ordering - superlattice reflection , as measured by x - ray photoemission scattering in the vicinity of @xmath12 @xcite , and softening of the raman - active phonon modes @xcite .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the interplay of superexchange and jt electron - lattice interaction in the heisenberg antiferromagnets lamno@xmath0 and kcuf@xmath0 is accompanied by the observed anomalous sideband excitations ( zone - boundary phonons or magnons ) , which become optically - active due to the distortion of the octahedral environment of the cu@xmath10 and mn@xmath2 ions .",
    "in such a case , a significant change of the orbital - ordering - superlattice structure could be indicative of the dynamic - to - static jt transition in these compounds .    in this paper , the anomalous multi - order raman scattering",
    "is investigated for a detwinned lamno@xmath0 crystal up to a fourth order .",
    "here we present the results of a comprehensive study of the temperature and polarisation dependences of the first- and higher - order raman scattering .",
    "based on the analysis of the obtained data , we suggest that the anomalous raman scattering is due to sidebands on the low - energy mode at about 25 @xmath1 .",
    "this behaviour is anisotropic , as within our experimental accuracy we have no indication on the presence of the low - energy mode in the @xmath18-polarised raman spectra .",
    "we argue that this low - energy mode originates from the electron tunneling between the potential energy minima arising near the jt mn@xmath2 ion due to the lattice anharmonicity , and the multi - order scattering is activated by this low - energy electronic motion . indeed",
    ", the frequency of the mode at about 25 @xmath1 is consistent with the tunneling frequencies in the dynamic limit of the jt effect in , for example , a @xmath19d system of 3 @xmath20 mgo : cu@xmath10 and 3 @xmath21 caf@xmath22 : sc@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is an experimental evidence of the low - energy mode observed at around 25 @xmath1 in a far - infrared experiment   in doped rare - earth manganites @xcite .",
    "the sidebands are dominated by the phonon density - of - states ( pdos ) of oxygen vibrations @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , as we have discovered during our study , aside from the oxygen - phonon density - of - states feature , there is an additional component to the multi - order scattering , which exhibits a different behaviour .",
    "we consider that this behaviour may arise from an admixture of the electronic component in the case of a weak vibronic interaction , when the barriers between the minima are less than the characteristic vibrational frequency , and a special coupling between low - frequency electronic motions and vibrational modes takes place @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the superexchange interaction may be crucial in driving the system of @xmath4 electrons to the regime of the dynamic jt effect , with affordable barriers for the tunneling between the potential energy minima .",
    "single crystals of lamno@xmath0 were grown using the crucible - free floating zone method in a mirror furnace , equipped with an arc lamp @xcite .",
    "as - grown lamno@xmath0 crystals are single phased and , below the orbital ordering temperature @xmath23 k , exhibit heavily twinned domain patterns in the orthorhombic _ pbnm _ structure .",
    "the particular pattern and the size of the domains depend on local temperature gradients and mechanical stresses , experienced during the growth stage .",
    "we were able to remove the twins from an essential part of the sample volume following the procedure , described in detail in our previous study @xcite .",
    "as a result , the percentage of detwinning detected at some areas of the crystal surface was as high as 95 % and over the entire surface it was at least 80 % .",
    "the orthorhombic [ 010 ] direction was identified as perpendicular to the crystal surface by single - crystal x - ray diffraction .",
    "the sample was further characterised by magnetometry , using a superconducting quantum interference device .",
    "we determined the antiferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath12 at 139.6 k , which is characteristic of a nearly oxygen - stoichiometric lamno@xmath0 crystal .",
    "the sample surface was polished to optical grade for further optical measurements .",
    "raman spectra were obtained using a raman - microscope spectrometer labram hr ( horiba jobin yvon ) , equipped with a grating monochromator and a liquid - nitrogen cooled ccd detector .",
    "the spectrometer has high spectral resolution ( 0.3 @xmath1/pixel at 633 nm ) , large spectral range of raman shift from 100 to 4000 @xmath1 and unique edge filter technology .",
    "hene laser source operating at 632.8 nm wavelength ( 1.96ev ) , with appropriate filters , was used for excitation under different irradiation power .",
    "the sample was mounted on a cold finger of the micro - cryostat , cooled with liquid nitrogen .",
    "we employed the near - normal back - scattering geometry with an adjustable confocal pinhole ; the propagation direction of the incident and scattered light was parallel to the principal [ 010 ] orthorhombic axis of the detwinned lamno@xmath0 crystal .",
    "the distinctive principle polarisations were recorded in the described here raman experiment , using generic linear polarisation of the laser radiation while rotating the sample in the @xmath24 plane .",
    "crystal symmetry determines the number of vibrational raman - active normal modes .",
    "a factor - group analysis of the orthorhombic crystal structure of lamno@xmath0 ( space group @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) with 4 f.u./unit cell yields a total number of 24 ( 7@xmath27 ) raman - active phonon modes . the raman scattering tensor determines whether the normal modes actually appear , and could be observed under irradiation with a polarised light at a given scattering geometry . on the oriented sample surface ,",
    "the @xmath28 symmetry phonons appear in the parallel @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 polarisations of the incident and scattered light , whereas the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 phonons appear in the crossed ( @xmath35 ) , ( @xmath36 ) , and ( @xmath37 ) polarisations , respectively .",
    "figure 1(a , c ) shows the low - temperature ( 80 k ) and room - temperature ( 300 k ) micro - raman spectra measured on the detwinned lamno@xmath0 crystal for the two selected polarisations of the incident hene laser irradiation , along the main @xmath18 crystallographic direction and along the @xmath38 direction , rotated by 45@xmath39 . with the incident light , polarised along the @xmath38 direction , we observed @xmath40 symmetry modes , whereas with the incident light , polarised along the @xmath18 axis , only @xmath28 symmetry modes became pronounced . at low temperature ( 80 k ) , our raman scattering measurements allowed us to identify six modes of @xmath28 symmetry at 148 , 210 , 267 , 295 , 452 , and 495 @xmath1 and four modes of @xmath32 symmetry at 197 , 313 , 436 , and 606 @xmath1 .",
    "two strong high - frequency modes @xmath28 ( 495 @xmath1 ) and @xmath32 ( 606 @xmath1 ) correspond to the in - plane vibrations , associated with jt in - phase anti - symmetric and symmetric stretching of the corner - shared oxygen octahedra in the lamno@xmath0 structure , respectively @xcite .",

    "_ , the @xmath32 mode shows softening below the nel temperature , which was interpreted as a consequence of magnetostriction effects @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence was less pronounced for the frequency of the @xmath28 mode , which reveals weak polarisation dependence . at the same time , the widths of these two modes showed no distinct anomaly near the nel temperature , increasing linearly with rising temperature in the studied temperature range .",
    "the temperature coefficient of the fwhm of the anti - symmetric jt @xmath28 mode ( averaged over the measured polarisations as shown in fig .",

    "figure 2(c ) shows temperature and polarisation dependences of the scaled integrated intensities of the @xmath28 and @xmath32 modes .",
    "remarkably , our raman study on the detwinned single crystal allowed us to detect the pronounced opposite trends in the temperature behaviour of the intensities of the @xmath28 mode , measured with the laser light polarised along the @xmath38 and @xmath18 directions ( however , we noticed different behaviour in the @xmath41 polarisation ) .",
    "moreover , the intensities of the @xmath28 and @xmath32 modes show a clear kink at the nel temperature at around 140 k. as it was established in the earlier study by krger _",
    "@xcite , the raman cross - section of the one - phonon @xmath28 and @xmath32 modes shows resonant behaviour under a hene ( 1.96 ev ) light irradiation , which corresponds to a maximum of the optical gap excitation in lamno@xmath0 at around 2 ev @xcite .",
    "we note that the observed anisotropy and temperature dependences of the scaled raman intensities , measured with the incident laser light polarised along the @xmath38 and @xmath18 directions of the detwinned lamno@xmath0 crystal , followed the same trend as the anisotropic optical spectral weight of the 2 ev optical band , influenced by the spin - spin correlations between the mn@xmath2 spins via the superexchange interaction @xcite .    in the first - order raman phonon scattering at higher frequencies ,",
    "an additional broad band located at around @xmath43 cm @xmath44 , which can not be assigned to a normal symmetry mode , was present ( see fig .",

    "the close - up of the first - order peak at 650 @xmath1 and the raman spectra in the second order , separated from the one - phonon lattice - symmetry raman modes and the background , is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "an extended structure , represented by the three broad features , is developed in the second order , which reveals strong polarisation dependence , so that only one broad feature of @xmath28 symmetry is pronounced in the @xmath18-polarised spectra . in the earlier raman study by saitoh _",
    "_ of a detwinned lamno@xmath0 crystal , these three broad features observed at around 1008 , 1170 , and 1290 @xmath1 were considered as a result of the dispersion of an independent orbital excitation , induced by the superexchange interaction @xcite .",
    "here we investigated in detail temperature and polarisation dependencies of the anomalous first- and second - order raman scattering and found them dependent due to a common origin .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows the frequencies of the first - order peak at around 650 @xmath1 multiplied by two and the second - order peak at around 1290 @xmath1 . a nearly one - to - one correspondence between these two frequencies in the temperature - dependent spectra of @xmath28 symmetry in the @xmath18 polarisation was observed .",
    "however , apparently they do not coincide in the @xmath41 and @xmath38 polarisations as the frequencies of the first - order peak multiplied by two appear to be shifted by approximately 25 @xmath1 higher with respect to the frequencies of the second - order peak ( see also the inset to fig .",
    "1(b ) , where the first- and second - order spectra are clearly delineated ) . at the same time",
    ", there is a clear correlation in the temperature dependencies of their peak positions , although we show a different trend in the temperature dependence in the @xmath41 polarisation , which seems to demonstrate a softening - like behaviour , analogous to that of the @xmath32 ( 606 @xmath1 ) mode below the nel temperature ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) . additionally , the widths of the first- and second - order peaks fall in the same range within the experimental error bars in the @xmath38 and @xmath18 polarisations ( see fig .",
    "the estimated coefficient in a linear approximation of the fwhm temperature dependence is about 0.06 @xmath9 0.01 @xmath1/k in the studied temperature range , comparable to that of the first - order jt @xmath28 ( 495 @xmath1 ) and @xmath32 ( 606 @xmath1 ) modes .",
    "this is indicative that the anomalous scattering observed in the @xmath38 and @xmath18 polarisations has essentially phononic character and could be associated with the maximum in the phonon density - of - states ( pdos ) of oxygen vibrations @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the temperature dependence of the fwhm of the first - order peak at 650 @xmath1 , and its second - order replica at 1290 @xmath1 , show very different behaviour in the @xmath41 polarisation , where the temperature coefficient of the linear temperature dependence is about 0.18 @xmath9 0.02 @xmath1/k .",
    "figure 3(c ) shows temperature and polarisation dependencies of the scaled integrated intensities of the first - order peak at 650 @xmath1 and the second - order peak at 1290 @xmath1 , which exhibit the same trends as that of the @xmath28 and b@xmath45 phonons ( see fig .",
    "2(c ) ) .    and finally , fig .",
    "4 shows the raman spectra measured in the multiphonon spectral range on our detwinned lamno@xmath0 crystal in the @xmath38 polarisation at @xmath46= 80 k. the spectra in the multiphonon range were observed on a background of a broad lorentzian band ( located at around 870 cm @xmath44 , with fwhm of about 1300 @xmath1 ) .",
    "the spectra were fitted with a set of lorentzians , accounting for the clearly resolved intensity peaks , and the result of the fit is shown in fig .",
    "4 . the inset shows the result of the fitting of the raman spectra in the multiphonon spectral range , subtracted from the contributions of the first - order lattice raman phonons and the background . according to this analysis of our raman data ,",
    "the multiple excitations appear with a period of about 630 @xmath1 up to the fourth order ; and , since we have unveiled that the first- and second - order raman scattering have a common origin , and the excitation observed in the first order at around 655 @xmath1 must be shifted by about 25 @xmath1 from the central laser line .",
    "this is consistent with our analysis presented in fig .",
    "the ratio between the two main peaks in the periodically repeated three - peak structure changes progressively in the multi - order scattering , from the dominating higher - frequency feature in the second - order process to the opposite case in the fourth - order process , whereas the two features are approximately equal in the third - order process .",
    "this might be associated with a progressive decrease of the @xmath28 contribution at 650 @xmath1 in the higher - order spectra , as observed in the second - order process ( see the inset of fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , where the decreased @xmath28 contribution at around 1300 @xmath1 against the enhanced relative contribution of @xmath32 symmetry at around 1165 and 1285 @xmath1 can be observed . from this follows that the anomalous raman scattering is essentially promoted by the @xmath32 mode at 510 @xmath1 , which appears periodically at around 1165 , 1795 , and 2425 @xmath1 in the multiple - order spectra .",
    "we have investigated a detailed temperature dependence of the first and higher - order raman scattering in the detwinned lamno@xmath0 crystal and , based on the results of this study , we can conclude that the multi - order raman scattering arises from the series of transitions , and that the triplet structure observed in the raman spectra in the 900  1400 @xmath1 range is the second replica in the series .",
    "this is in contrast to the conclusions of saitoh _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the three peaks observed in the 900  1400 @xmath1 range at around 1008 , 1170 , and 1290 @xmath1 were previously interpreted as a result of dispersion of an independent orbital excitation , related to the superexchange interaction .",

    "however , we can not find the @xmath62-point raman and/or infrared mode at @xmath48 630 @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "it has been suggested by iliev _",
    "_ that the feature at around 650 @xmath1 , replicated in the multi - order raman scattering , corresponds to the maximum of the phonon density - of - states ( pdos ) of oxygen vibrations , which is in good agreement with the lattice - dynamics theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "according to the results of our raman study on the detwinned lamno@xmath0 crystal in the multiphonon spectral range , we propose that the pdos feature has a period of @xmath48 630 @xmath1 in the @xmath38 polarisation , and that the strong peak at @xmath53 510 @xmath1 is dominated by the contribution from the zone - boundary @xmath32 phonons to the pdos .    we still need to provide an explanation for the shift of the multi - order raman scattering from the zero frequency by @xmath47 25 @xmath1 , observed in this study ( see fig . 4 and the inset ) .",
    "we suggest that this shift could result from a low - energy mode , allowed by symmetry ; in this case , the periodically repeated oxygen pdos feature with a period of @xmath48 630 @xmath1 could be sidebands , activated by some process , and not allowed by symmetry .",

    "we argue that the low - energy mode at @xmath47 25 @xmath1 could be a tunneling transition in lamno@xmath0 , and the periodically repeated oxygen pdos feature with a period of @xmath48 630 @xmath1 could be the sidebands , activated by the electron tunneling between the potential energy minima generated near the jt mn@xmath2 ion by the lattice anharmonicity . indeed , first of all , we note that the frequency of the mode at around 25 @xmath1 is consistent with the tunneling frequencies in the dynamic limit of the jahn - teller effect in , for example , a @xmath19d system of 3 @xmath20 mgo : cu@xmath10 and 3 @xmath21 caf@xmath22 : sc@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "secondly , in our recent optical study of lamno@xmath0 we have established that the kinetic energy changes of the @xmath4 electrons from the low- to high - temperature limit , associated with the high - spin @xmath76 electronic transition , seen in the optical spectra at 2 ev , is about 55 mev @xcite .",
    "this energy is comparable with the orbital ordering temperature , @xmath77 = 780 k = 65 mev , and much higher than the energy of the average lattice anharmonicity barriers between the potential energy minima of about 100 @xmath1 ( 12 mev ) .",
    "therefore , the superexchange interaction may be crucial in driving the @xmath4 electrons to the regime of the dynamic jt effect , with affordable barriers for the tunneling between the potential energy minima .",
    "finally we note that the dynamic regime of the jahn  teller effect could result in the anomalous multi - order raman scattering in manganites .",
    "indeed , we have discovered in the present study that aside from the oxygen - phonon density - of - states feature , there is an additional component to the multi - order scattering , which exhibits a different behavior .",
    "this character may arise from an admixture of the electronic component in the case of mixing between the electronic and vibrational states . for a weak vibronic interaction ,",
    "when the barriers between the minima are less than the characteristic vibrational energy , a special coupling between low - frequency electronic motions and vibrational modes takes place @xcite . in the linear approximation ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the system are those of a doubly - degenerate harmonic oscillator , @xmath78 , where @xmath51 is a positive integer and the @xmath79 level is ( @xmath51 + 1)-fold degenerate . in the second order of the perturbation theory ,",
    "the degeneracy can be removed and all levels , except the ground state level with @xmath51=0 , become split .",
    "this splitting is similar to the effect of spin - orbit interaction in diatomic molecules , where for each @xmath51 there is the degeneracy with @xmath80 .",
    "further experiments are needed to investigate and verify the origin of the low - energy mode at about 25 @xmath1 and the low - energy electron - vibronic coupling in manganites , which is indicative of the dynamic regime of the jahn ",
