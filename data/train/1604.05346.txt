    "the chromospheric evaporation is also observed in the iris uv chromospheric and transition region lines . however ,",
    "interpretation of the doppler shift is less straightforward and depends on the energy transfer mechanism and heating rates resulting in `` gentle '' and `` explosive '' types of evaporation ( see papers of @xcite and simulations of @xcite for the details ) .",

    "one of the most disputed effects is a significant time delay of the coronal evaporation flow relative to the chromospheric response observed as redshift of relatively cold uv lines corresponding to downflowing plasma .",
    "@xcite found the delays of about the 60s using iris spectral data .",
    "however , the numerical simulations of the standard `` thick - target '' flare model predict that both phenomena should occur simultaneously .    there are some attempts to explain this discrepancy .",
    "emission of the fexxi line might be very weak at the initial and supposedly blueshifted stages of the evaporation , and then became stronger but less blueshifted .",
    "this situation is clearly illustrated in the paper of @xcite .",

    "in this paper we focus on a detailed spatio - temporal analysis of the chromospheric evaporation during an m1.0 class flare occurred on 12 june , 2014 from 21:01ut to 21:19ut in active region noaa 12087 . at this time the active region",
    "was located south - east ( heliocentric coordinates s22e49 ) on the solar disc , and the flare event was well - covered by the iris observations in the coarse - raster mode ( the iris observational set started long before the flare beginning and continued long after the flare decay ) .",
    "the eight slit positions run in a cyclic order with a high cadence ( @xmath1020s for the full cycle ) allowed us to study the flare spectra in most of the flare region .",
    "some general properties of the chromospheric evaporation during this flare have already been studied in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "dynamical and magnetic processes in the vicinity of the magnetic polarity inversion line ( pil ) have been studied by  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the process of chromospheric evaporation and its relations to the flare magnetic geometry in more detail .",
    "in addition to the spectroscopic data , the knowledge of the magnetic field topology is very important for understanding of the flare dynamics .",
    "the magnetic field and corresponding electric current systems are the primary sources of energy of solar flares",
    ". they can store the flare energy ( about @xmath11-@xmath12erg , * ? ? ? * ) and convert it to the kinetic energy of moving plasma and accelerated particles via magnetic reconnection , joule heating and other mechanisms .",
    "thus , it is especially important to know the magnetic field configuration .",
    "nowadays it is possible to obtain photospheric vector magnetograms from the sdo / hmi telescope @xcite and reconstruct magnetic field in the solar atmosphere under certain assumptions .",
    "one of the key characteristics of the magnetic field structure is the quasi - separatrix layer ( qsl , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from the physical point of view , the qsl is a relatively thin surface where the magnetic field connectivity exhibits strong gradients  @xcite , which can work as a channel of magnetic energy dissipation .    nowadays",
    ", it is also possible to analyze flares with high - resolution using observations with large ground - based telescopes .",
    "one of the most breakthrough ground - based facilities is the new solar telescope ( nst , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at big bear solar observatory .",
    "the 1.6 m primary mirror and implemented adaptive optics provide diffraction - limited images and resolve features that are smaller than 0.1@xmath13 .",
    "the studied flare was observed by the nst , and in this work we utilize the nst observations obtained in the h@xmath2 line core .",
    "the iris observation covered temporarily the entire event for more than one hour from appearance of the first signs of flaring activity until the end of the decay phase .",
    "the instrument obtained spectra in several wavelength windows in each point of the region with @xmath1020s temporal and 0.33@xmath142@xmath13 spatial resolution . to analyze the large amount of spectroscopic data we implemented the following techniques of the line profile analysis .    for each line formed in the chromosphere and chromosphere - corona transition region ( i.e. mgiik&h2796&2803 ,",
    "cii1334&1335 , siiv1403 ) the center - of - gravity approach used in our previous paper  @xcite was implemented . for each line",
    "profile the following characteristics are calculated : 1 )  the line peak intensity and 2 )  the doppler shift defined as a difference between the center of gravity of the line and the reference wavelength for this line @xmath15 .",
    "obviously , the implemented technique can not be applied for blended lines .",
    "an example of such kind of line is , in fact , the iris fexxi1354.1 line which is formed in @xmath16k hot plasma , and is very important for our study .",
    "the blends of this line are discussed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  2 ) and ( * ? ? ? * appendix a ) .",
    "we decided to take into account only the strongest blend , the ci1354.3 line .",
    "our previous study  @xcite did not reveal significant doppler shifts of this line during the flare .",
    "thus , for the fexxi line we performed a double - gaussian fitting with a fixed peak wavelength of the second gaussian profile corresponding to the @xmath17   the reference wavelength of the ci line . using these procedures we determined the temporal and spatial behavior of the doppler shift of the chromospheric , lower transition region and coronal lines that all are essential for studying the chromospheric evaporation .    as mentioned before",
    ", it is especially important to study the delay of the evaporated hot plasma flow observed as blueshift of the hot coronal lines relative to the chromospheric response ( observed as redshift or blueshift of the cooler chromospheric or transition region lines ) .",
    "the dynamics of the hot evaporated plasma is studied using observations of the fexxi1354.1 line .",
    "we also use the cii1334.5 line as a representative of the colder chromospheric layer response to the flare heating .",
    "the cii line is formed at @xmath5 .",
    "it is not overexposed in this flare unlike the siiv line , and its shape is simpler than that of the mgii lines .",
    "the iris raster scans provide an opportunity to study the spatial configuration of the delays across the flare region . for this analysis",
    "the following procedure was performed .",
    "first , the doppler shift of the cii1334.5 line was estimated at every point for each time moment of the iris scans in the region , and the same was done for the fexxi1354.1 line . after this ,",
    "the temporal evolutions of the redshift and blueshift in each point were plotted and smoothed with a 50s running window for better estimation of their peak times .",
    "the peak times of the redshift and blueshift maxima were determined visually from the plotted curves . in places where the redshifts or blueshifts did not show any peak or even were equal to zero we set the delay to zero . also , the delay was determined only in the flare `` bright points '' , where the averaged over time magnitude of the cii1334.5 line was greater than the one eighth of the mean magnitude of this line across the flare region .",
    "to reconstruct the magnetic field for the studied event , we followed the approach of  @xcite implemented in the _ nlfff _ package of the solar software ( ssw ) for interactive data language ( idl ) .",
    "the algorithm finds the solution for the nonlinear force - free field ( nlfff ) approximation assuming that all electric currents flow along the field lines . for the boundary conditions , the 12-minute full - sun vector magnetograms obtained by the hmi / sdo instrument  @xcite were used .",
    "we reconstructed the magnetic field for eight time moments covering the flare period from 20:22:25ut to 21:46:25ut with 12min cadence .",
    "for the magnetic force line tracing , a tri - linear interpolation technique implemented in the ssw nlfff package was used . to estimate topological peculiarities of the magnetic field in the flare region we applied a method of quasi - separatrix layer ( qsl ) calculation @xcite .",
    "the qsls mark regions with sharp variations of magnetic field connectivity . to make a quantitative estimate of the connectivity changes at a point @xmath18 we use parameter called squashing factor @xmath19 calculated as :    -.6 cm @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are components of the vector connecting the starting point of the magnetic field line crossing @xmath18 with its end at the photospheric level .",
    "the coordinate derivatives @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 characterize variations of magnetic connectivity from point to point .",
    "in addition , we analyzed the flare x - ray data from the reuven ramaty high - energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi , * ? ? ? * ) and compared the 12 - 25kev x - ray sources reconstructed by using the clean algorithm with the magnetic field topology .",
    "the observed flux above 25kev was very weak and insufficient for the source reconstruction .",
    "the integrated over the flare region intensities and doppler shifts of the cii1334.5 and fexxi1354.1 lines are displayed in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "the doppler shifts and line intensities are estimated by techniques discussed in sec .  2 , and plotted with different colors ( see caption of fig .  [ figure1 ] for the color code ) .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] represents the fexxi1354.1 line integrated activity .",
    "a delay of the fexxi line intensity relative to its doppler shift is very obvious , and , probably , occurs because of filling the magnetic loops by the hot evaporated plasma .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ figure1 ] displays the mean intensity and doppler shift of the cii line .",
    "one can notice an increase of the cii redshift during the flare , and its correlations with the x - ray 12 - 25kev light curve from rhessi .",
    "previously  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) , it was mentioned that the slowly varying redshifts mainly represent some background activity in the region .",
    "[ figure1 ] shows that we observe a superposition of the relatively steady downflows and the fast varying downflows due to the flare energy release .",
    "two dotted vertical lines in figure  [ figure1 ] correspond to the first peaks of the cii line redshift and fexxi line blueshift .",
    "one can see that the peak of the fexxi blueshift is delayed with respect to the cii line redshift for about one minute .",
    "such delays pose a significant problem for the understanding of the flare dynamics . according to many 1d simulations of the chromospheric evaporation in the framework of the `` thick - target '' model ,",
    "in which the chromosphere is heated by a beam of accelerated electrons  @xcite , the redshifts and blueshifts should be observed almost simultaneously at the start of the evaporation process .    in the previous paper @xcite we mentioned that the evaporation process in this flare can be characterized as of the `` gentle '' type because of the subsonic velocities of the evaporated plasma according to  @xcite .",
    "however , the integrated redshift of the cii line ( see fig.[figure1 ] for details ) obviously increases during the flare activity , which may be a sign of the explosive evaporation according to  @xcite .",
    "[ figure1 ] also reveals significant background steady plasma downflows obvious before and after the flare .",
    "possibly , the evaporation in this region is very complex and has a fine structure , and can not be classified as pure explosive or gentle one , according to the models .",
    "the distribution of the fexxi1354.1 blueshift delay relative to the cii1334.5 redshift across the flare region is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] . the procedure which we have performed to measure the delays",
    "is described in sec .  2 .",
    "the result is presented in the form of the contour lines corresponding to the delays of 30s , 60s , 120s and 240s .",
    "the iris 1330 sj image is shown in the bottom for better representation of the chromospheric activity .",
    "as one can see , the delays distributed across the flare region can be longer than two minutes that is longer than the previously reported 1-minute delays @xcite .",
    "the delays are distributed along the flare ribbon visible in the background iris1330 sj image , and are not uniform especially in the region in the top - left corner of the white box .",
    "flare ribbons are thought to be closely connected to the magnetic field configuration in the region . in the standard flare model",
    "it is assumed that because of the deposit of energy and accelerated particles along the flare loops , the plasma emission becomes stronger near the loop footpoints that becomes visible as the flare ribbons .",
    "thus , we have decided to study the magnetic field properties in the region in order to better understand their relationship to the observed delay distribution .      for the magnetic field reconstruction",
    ", we use the nlfff method of  @xcite and vector magnetograms from hmi / sdo as the boundary conditions .",
    "figure  [ figure3 ] represents the reconstructed magnetic field structure . in panel",
    "( a ) this structure resembles the flux - rope which was observed in the nst images and reported by @xcite  and  @xcite .",
    "the bottom grey - scale image represents the radial magnetic field ( white for the positive and black for the negative polarity regions ) .",
    "as one can see , the field lines of the flux rope are twisted , reflecting a nonpotential nature of the magnetic field in the studied region with the currents embedded .",
    "this configuration is located exactly at the polarity inversion line ( pil ) .",
    "the detailed structure and dynamics of this region , which is likely to be the primary energy source for the flare , is discussed in a separate paper by  @xcite .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] illustrate the reconstructed magnetic field structure and the flare ribbons observed in the iris sj 1330 image . for better understanding",
    "the structure , only the magnetic field lines reaching a certain range of heights ( 2@xmath13 - 6@xmath13 , or 1.5 - 4.5 mm ) are presented .",
    "the higher magnetic field lines have their footpoints far away from the flare ribbons , and thus do not participate in the energy transfer during the flare .",
    "the bottom panel is the iris 1330 slit - jaw image for 21:04:43ut .",
    "the field lines corresponding to the flux rope mentioned above are shown in green in this figure .",
    "one can see that almost all the lines starting from the flare ribbons have their other footpoint near the flux rope region at the pil .",
    "one of the possibilities to understand changes of the magnetic field topology and its connection with the observed delays is to reconstruct the so - called quasi - separatrix layer  ( qsl , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have already described the computational procedure in sec .",
    "it was found that the qsl evolves with height very smoothly .",
    "thus , we decided to utilize the qsl at height of @xmath26 km above the photosphere , and calculated the squashing factor for the comparison .",
    "the qsl structure presented in figure  [ figure4 ] is mostly stable before ( from 20:22:25ut to 20:58:25ut ) and after ( from 21:22:25ut to 21:46:25ut ) the flare .",
    "however , during the flare impulsive phase the qsl undergoes significant changes in the region marked by the red dashed ellipse .",
    "the magnetic field neutral line also undergoes significant changes restricted to the marked region . because of the 12min integration time of the sdo / hmi vector magnetogram data",
    ", we can not determine when exactly during the period from 21:04:25ut to 21:16:25ut the qsl evolved .",
    "we compare the qsl chromospheric structure with the flare ribbons visible in the iris1330 sj images and the nst h@xmath2 line core images .",
    "the result is presented in figure  [ figure5 ] .",
    "the observing times are shown for each panel .",
    "one can notice a correspondence between the flare ribbons and the qsl cross - section .",
    "also , the evolution of both the qsl and the flare ribbons ( for both nst and iris observations ) demonstrate similar patterns , confirming the idea of the flare energy transport along the qsl forming the flare ribbons @xcite .",
    "to understand when exactly the evolution of the flare ribbons occurred , we studied the behavior of the h@xmath2 flare ribbon in more details .",
    "we found that the motions of the flare ribbon occurred during the period from 21:12ut to 21:15ut , i.e after the impulsive phase of the flare .",
    "this time interval is within the uncertainty interval determined for the qsl change ( from 21:04:25ut to 21:16:25ut ) . also , only the north - eastern part of the ribbon changes , the other parts are mostly stable ( see fig .  [ figure5]g - h ) .",
    "figure  [ figure6 ] demonstrates the distribution of the delays across the flare region with the qsl chromospheric cross - section and the field lines plotted from the delay regions .",
    "the nst h@xmath2 line core image is displayed in the background .",
    "additionally , we have plotted the rhessi 12 - 25kev contours in the same figure . for the field lines displayed in this figure we can say the same as for ones plotted in fig .  [ figure3 ] : the height of most of the field lines does not exceed 4.5 mm ( or 6@xmath13 ) .",
    "so , the lines connecting the flux rope site and the delay regions do not extend high into the solar corona .",
    "the fact that the rhessi 12 - 25kev sources plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] coincide in general with the footpoints of the large loop arcade supports the idea of transfer of the energetic particles along these loops .",
    "however , the acceleration site could not be determined from these data .",
    "in this paper we studied the chromospheric evaporation event during the m1.0 goes class flare occurred on june 12 , 2014 from 21:01ut till 21:19ut .",
    "the evaporated plasma flows were detected in the hot fexxi1354.1 line , and the response of the `` colder '' layers was studied with the help of the lower transition region cii1334.5 line .",
    "the main focus was on the distribution of the chromospheric evaporation delays ( time between the cii doppler shift maximum and the fexxi blueshift maximum ) .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field lines were reconstructed from the photospheric vector magnetograms , and the qsl was computed and compared with the flare ribbons .",
    "let us remind the main observational findings mentioned in this study :    1 .",
    "the averaged over the region cii redshift presented in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] is correlated with the flare activity observed in the rhessi 12 - 25kev ; fexxi blueshift maximum is delayed relative to the cii redshift maximum for about 1min .",
    "the detailed spatially - resolved study of the delays demonstrate their presence in many points along the flare ribbon , with the possible delays for longer than 2min ( see fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the distribution of the delays across the initially - observed flare ribbon ( in both iris 1330 and nst h@xmath2 line core observations ) is not uniform .",
    "the reconstructed magnetic field lines from the delay regions mainly connect the flare ribbon with the flux rope structure .",
    "their height very rare exceeds 4.5 mm , revealing their low - lying nature .",
    "4 .   the rhessi 12 - 25kev sources reasonably correspond to the footpoints of the main bundle of the reconstructed magnetic field lines . 5 .",
    "the evolution of the qsl and flare ribbons detected in the iris1330 and nst h@xmath2 line core images demonstrate the same patterns : mostly stable configuration with the motion in the north - east part of the region .",
    "this region is the only one along the initial qsl where the delays were not detected due to low fexxi signal .",
    "the spatio - temporal properties of the chromospheric evaporation reveal very strong delays of the blueshift of the hot evaporating plasma relative to the redshifts of the cold chromospheric plasma across the flare region . despite the integrated blueshift ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) demonstrates the delay for about 1min , the spatially - resolved delays are found to be even more than 2min in several zones along the flare ribbon .",
    "thus , the integrated delay of the region represents itself the superposition of many spatially - distributed delays occurred in different points and caused by the excitation of the chromospheric evaporation process in different loops . in some sense , the observed situation corresponds to the `` multi - thread '' model @xcite exactly proposing a sequence of independently heated threads occurred in different loops . as it is clearly seen from fig .  7 in our previous work  @xcite , the chromospheric excitation took place in different points across the region at different times .",
    "and thus it is not surprising that we have received the same kind of behavior for the delays .",
    "the `` multi - thread '' model was considered for the chromospheric evaporation studies in the work of  @xcite , where the authors used the radyn code and superposition of evaporation events occurred in several loops at different times to adequately model the observed signals .",
    "nevertheless , none of these models can explain the observed blueshift delay .",
    "the reconstructed magnetic field geometry also corresponds to the multi - thread model but reveals an interesting complex configuration . as was observed from fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , the magnetic configuration of the region represents a twisted small - scale loops constructing a magnetic flux rope located at the polarity inversion line , and the bundles of more large - scale magnetic field lines with one footpoint located near the flux rope and the other footpoint located in the flare ribbons , i.e. connecting the flare ribbons and evaporating regions with the flux rope .",
    "this magnetic flux rope was studied in more details in the paper of  @xcite .",
    "their study revealed strong current dissipation and large gradients of the magnetic field associated with the flux rope , near the polarity inversion line for this region .",
    "one of the conclusions was that the dissipation processes in this region can be the primary energy source for this flare .",
    "it is obvious from the reconstructed magnetic field configuration that accelerated particles and heat flux can spread from the flux rope region to the observed flare ribbons along the field lines .",
    "injections of the particles and heat flux into different loops produce the chromospheric evaporation in different spatial zones as we find in the observations .",
    "thus , the flux rope region at the polarity inversion line may play a role of the `` energy source '' for the event .",
    "the footpoints of the large - scale magnetic field lines ( coming from right top to left bottom in fig .  [ figure6 ] ) adequately coincide with the rhessi 12 - 25kev sources plotted in the same figure .",
    "it was found that almost all the magnetic field lines connecting the blueshift delay regions with the flux rope are low - lying ( see fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] ) .",
    "their height rarely exceeds 4.5 mm , thus , these loops mainly do not expand high into the corona .",
    "this means that all the delays were observed in the low - lying loops .",
    "the delays are non - uniformly distributed along the flare ribbon ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] ) , but without any obvious patterns .",
    "one of the possible explanations of the delays based on the non - equilibrium fe ionization @xcite was discussed in the introduction .",
    "the results presented in fig.6 - 8 of  @xcite show that the fexix ion population reaches equilibrium for the considered durations of the heating phase ( up to 60s ) , but the fexxiv ions are out of equilibrium with low population .",
    "there are no results presented for the fexxi , and it is hard to understand how does the fexxi ion population behaves during the heating phase .",
    "however , the highly ionized fe fractions ( including fexix and fexxiv ) are in equilibrium conditions during the thermal conductive cooling phase .",
    "the non - equilibrium ionization explanation of delays becomes suitable only if very long continuous heating ( for more than 2min ) is presented .",
    "the first assumption may contradicts the impulsive nature of solar flares .",
    "the strong growth of the cii intensity light curve in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] and results presented in fig .  7 in @xcite support",
    "the idea that the chromosphere heating was impulsive .",
    "thus , the non - equilibrium ionization mechanism seems to be partly , but not fully responsible for the observed delays .",
    "the fact that the evaporation takes place in the low - lying loop geometry is the only one we can lean on .",
    "the only region where the delays are not present or not possible to calculate is the upper left corner of figure  [ figure6 ] .",
    "figures  [ figure4 ]  and  [ figure5 ] clearly show that this region is the only one where the flare ribbon motion and the qsl chromospheric cross - section evolution was observed .",
    "we looked at the spectra of this region in detail and revealed the following : despite the cii redshift was significant , the weak signal in the fexxi line led to the impossibility to calculate the delay . as shown in panels a , d , e and h of fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , the computed qsl cross - section fits the observed flare ribbons quite accurately before and after the impulsive phase of the flare .",
    "thus , one can assume that the qsl evolved at the same time as flare ribbons did   i.e. from 21:12ut till 21:16ut .",
    "the first 12 - 25kev x - ray pulse occurred at @xmath2721:06ut ( the first rhessi 12 - 25kev peak corresponds to the first peak in the cii integrated light curve in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "however , at the time when the flare ribbon motion was observed , the rhessi 12 - 25kev curve , as well as the cii integrated light curves , experience the decay phase .",
    "the motion of the flare ribbons might correspond to the process called slipping magnetic reconnection  @xcite .",
    "this model is quite new but already found observational evidences  @xcite .",
    "however , it seems that the studied flare was not driven by the slipping magnetic reconnection mechanism . despite the ribbon motion",
    "was observed , it occurred definitely after the impulsive phase of the flare . even if the slipping mechanism is responsible for this motion , it happened after the impulsive phase and could not support the ideas that the flare energy is released in the qsl .",
    "of course , the found relationship between the chromospheric evaporation delays and the magnetic field configuration is based only on one studied event .",
    "further statistical study is needed to confirm the proposed dependences .",

    "<S> chromospheric evaporation is observed as doppler blueshift during solar flares . </S>",
    "<S> it plays one of key roles in dynamics and energetics of solar flares , however , its mechanism is still unknown . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a detailed analysis of spatially - resolved multi - wavelength observations of chromospheric evaporation during an m1.0 class solar flare ( sol2014 - 06 - 12t21:12 ) using data from the nasa s iris ( interface region imaging spectrograph ) and hmi / sdo ( helioseismic and magnetic imager onboard solar dynamics observatory ) telescopes , and vis / nst ( visible imaging spectrometer at new solar telescope ) high - resolution observations , covering the temperature range from 10@xmath0k to 10@xmath1k . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the averaged over the region fexxi blueshift of the hot evaporating plasma is delayed relative to the cii redshift of the relatively cold chromospheric plasma by about 1min . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of the delays is not uniform across the region and can be as long as 2min in several zones . using vector magnetograms from hmi we reconstruct the magnetic field topology and the quasi - separatrix layer ( qsl ) and find that the blueshift delay regions as well as the h@xmath2 flare ribbons are connected to the region of magnetic polarity inversion line ( pil ) and an expanding flux rope via a system of low - lying loop arcades with height @xmath3 4.5 mm . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to propose an interpretation of the chromospheric evaporation based on the geometry of local magnetic fields , and the primary energy source associated with the pil . </S>"
