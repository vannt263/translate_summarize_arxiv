    "astronomical observations of galactic rotation curves  @xcite and velocity distribution of galaxies in clusters  @xcite , smallness of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite , and in a striking manner the bullet cluster  @xcite , have all provided significant evidence that there is 5 times more matter in the universe that interacts gravitationally than is visible .",
    "the dominant thinking is that dark matter is comprised of a new non - baryonic particle , is electrically neutral and therefore almost transparent .",
    "if dark matter is abundantly present it must be very stable .",
    "the standard approach to prevent it from decaying to normal matter is to introduce an unbroken @xmath5 symmetry whereby the dark matter particles are odd under @xmath5 while normal matter particles are even .",
    "this then implies that the _ lightest _ @xmath5 odd particle is stable .    however introducing @xmath5 only for the purpose of stability is unsatisfactory as it does not provide greater insight ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover there is considerable arbitrariness in model building as there are many ways to introduce it .",
    "therefore there is a need for a deeper approach to the problem of stability of dark matter .    in this work",
    "we first prove at a fundamental level that parity ( @xmath0 ) can stabilize dark matter , though it is spontaneously broken . illustrating this with left - right symmetric dark sector we show that @xmath5 that is usually invoked to stabilize dark matter emerges as an automatic symmetry .",
    "we find that if dark matter is stabilized by parity , then dark fermions and neutrinos must have majorana masses and there is no conserved dark charge or lepton number . the seesaw mechanism on neutrinos maybe thus related to dark matter stability .",
    "since we require only @xmath0 to stabilize dark matter we do not depend on stability ideas that use gauge symmetries such as @xmath7 or @xmath8 that would restrict us to multiplets with specific @xmath9 quantum numbers assigned so that r - parity or matter - parity are automatic symmetries  @xcite .",
    "our work is also distinct from models requiring additional symmetries along with @xmath0 to stabilize dark matter  @xcite or that look at viability of explaining dark matter issues in the minimal left - right model itself without additional fields  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is well motivated not only on aesthetic grounds and because it is a discrete space - time symmetry , but also as is well known @xmath0 requires that right - handed neutrinos must exist ( and thus predicts that neutrinos have masses and mixing , as is now established by experiments ) .",
    "moreover as was shown in  @xcite , @xmath0 along with @xmath2 ( equivalent to another discrete space - time symmetry , time - reversal @xmath10 due to @xmath11 theorem ) solves the strong @xmath2 problem in left - right symmetric models with the addition of a vectorlike quark family . in",
    "@xcite it was noted that leptonic @xmath2 violating phases can vanish in models such as in  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we show that even after inclusion of dark matter , leptonic @xmath2 phases vanish at tree level in the minimal strong @xmath2 solving model .",
    "we also find more generally that @xmath2 with an additional symmetry ( such as @xmath0 or @xmath5 ) can solve the strong @xmath2 problem and predict the absence of leptonic @xmath2 phases .",
    "if leptonic @xmath2 violating phases are not detected at the sensitivity of experiments such as in  @xcite that are being planned or underway , it will hint at @xmath2 being broken spontaneously ( or softly ) and there being a second hidden symmetry such as @xmath12 or @xmath6 as well in nature .",
    "it is interesting that a global analysis of neutrino data  @xcite finds possible hints for the dirac leptonic phase to be close to the @xmath2 conserving value of @xmath4 , though the experimental margin of error is still very large .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : pstabilizes ]",
    "we provide a quantum mechanical argument to show that if there are relative non - real intrinsic parity phases , @xmath0 can stabilize dark matter though it is spontaneously broken . in sections",
    "[ sec : majorana ] and  [ sec : xparticles ] we show in specific left - right symmetric models that a relative imaginary intrinsic parity phase can not be rotated away by redefinitions of @xmath0 operator .",
    "we thus establish in a basis independent manner that @xmath0 can stabilize the dark sector and predict that neutrinos and dark neutral particles must have majorana masses .",
    "we still need to show that in the dark sector stabilized by @xmath0 , the _",
    "neutral _ particle is stable , and we do this in section  [ sec : masses ] by studying different regions of parameter space . in section  [ sec : strongcp ]",
    "we show that if the lagranigain is invariant under both discrete space - time symmetries @xmath0 and @xmath2 , we can simultaneously solve the strong @xmath2 problem , have stable dark matter and predict the absence of leptonic @xmath2 violation without requiring any other symmetry .",
    "we also show more generally that @xmath2 with an additional symmetry can predict the absence of leptonic @xmath2 phases .",
    "we first argue that _ parity ( p ) can stabilize dark matter , even if it is spontaneously broken .",
    "_ let @xmath0 be a good symmetry of the lagrangian ( such as in the left - right symmetric model ) and there be higgs fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 that transform under @xmath0 as @xmath15 .",
    "note that indices @xmath16 and @xmath17 on scalar fields are just labels .",
    "@xmath0 is spontaneously broken ( or hidden ) when the neutral component @xmath18 picks a constant vacuum expectation value ( vev ) such that @xmath19 .",
    "however applying @xmath0 twice it is easy to check that under @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and it follows that though @xmath0 is broken , @xmath20 _ remains unbroken _ by these vevs .",
    "note that we have used the fact that since @xmath0 is a good symmetry of the lagrangian , so is @xmath20 .",
    "classically @xmath20 ( space inversion followed by space inversion ) returns a system to its original state .",
    "but quantum mechanically this needs to be true only up to a phase .",
    "that is there can exist states @xmath23 such that , @xmath24 since only @xmath25 is physically observable and not the eigenstate @xmath23 itself . under @xmath20 different quantum fields",
    "can pick up different phases characterized by @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath27 is called intrinsic parity as it is the parity of underlying @xmath0 eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "hence we use _ intrinsic parity squared _ for the @xmath20 eigenvalue @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath20 is conserved , the lightest particle @xmath29 with intrinsic parity squared @xmath30 ( _ we identify @xmath29 with dark matter _ ) can not decay into a final state with intrinsic parity squared @xmath31 .",
    "that is into a final state consisting of particles that all have intrinsic parity squared 1 ( or normal matter ) .",
    "this ensures the stability of dark matter .",
    "however if @xmath0 is redefined to remove all complex @xmath32 in that basis @xmath0 can not explain dark matter stability , which must then be due to another symmetry .",
    "since the redefined @xmath0 operator has to be a symmetry this restricts the possible redefinitions to @xmath33 , where unitary transformation @xmath34 is a multiplicative symmetry of the lagrangian  @xcite . as we shall see in the next section if @xmath35 , dark matter fermions can have majorana masses .",
    "neutrinos with @xmath36 can also have majorana masses . due to presence of majorana terms ( couplings that give rise to majorana masses ) ,",
    "along with all the usual terms consistent with parity and gauge symmetry , there is not enough symmetry to remove the purely imaginary relative intrinsic parity phase by @xmath0 redefinitions . in this case , as shown in the next section in a basis indepedent manner , @xmath0 stabilizes dark matter . on the other hand , for non - real @xmath37 ,",
    "majorana terms are disallowed by @xmath0 for dark sector and @xmath38 can be made real through a redefinition of parity symmetry . in this case @xmath0 can not stabilize dark matter .",
    "we now consider the well known left - right symmetric group  @xcite @xmath39 which is the most popular and economical way to restore parity as a good symmetry of the lagrangian so that it can be spontaneously broken .",
    "we consider the usual higgs content suitable for symmetry breaking , namely , @xmath40 higgs fields ( either doublet @xmath41 and its parity partner @xmath42 as in section  [ sec : majorana ] , or triplet @xmath14 and its parity partner @xmath13 as in section  [ sec : xparticles ] ) , and the bidoublet @xmath43 .",
    "the matter content consists of the usual 3 generations of quarks and leptons represented by @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 ) such that under @xmath0 , space - time coordinates @xmath47 , the gauge bosons of @xmath48 and , @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 .",
    "the above is the usual parity transformation commonly used in left - right symmetric models . by applying @xmath0",
    "twice we note that all the above states are unchanged and therefore we have @xmath52 for all the usual particles .",
    "we recall that in the left - right model the representation of particles is as follows : @xmath53 where as an example of the lepton and quark doublets we have shown the first generation lepton doublets @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 ( or @xmath57 ) breaks @xmath58 to the standard model .",
    "@xmath0 is also broken , but @xmath20 remains unbroken .",
    "@xmath59 cause the electro - weak symmetry breaking and provides usual dirac masses to fermions through yukawa couplings such as @xmath60 ( with @xmath61 ) . as is well known in left - right models , yukawa matrices ( with matrix elements @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) involving the bi - doublet are hermitian due to parity .",
    "also all terms in the higgs potential consistent with parity , such as @xmath64  @xmath65  @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 $ ] ( with their hermitian conjugates , and @xmath71 real due to @xmath0 ) , are present if the corresponding higgs field is present .",
    "this ensures that there are no additional symmetries in the model than what we will consider .",
    "this is important to note since if they are present , symmetries can be used to redefine the @xmath0 operator .",
    "the higgs potential for minimal left - right symmetric model is given in  @xcite and we do not write all the terms here .",
    "we include a majorana fermion @xmath72 which is a singlet of the gauge group , and all the fermionic and higgs fields in the model are as in table  [ tab : table0 ] . since majorana fermions are their own antiparticles , their intrinsic parity @xmath73  @xcite . under @xmath74 @xmath75 so that under @xmath20 , @xmath76 . note that we have assigned @xmath77 to all other particles including @xmath78 to leptons .",
    ".left - right symmetric model with addition of a majorana fermion @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath79 to @xmath80 correspond to the usual 3 chiral families of quarks and leptons . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that in this model since majorana terms such as @xmath81 violate gauge invariance and are not permitted , the @xmath82 generation quarks can not be made stable by parity . since no other symmetries are imposed , they can not belong in the dark sector but must couple to other quarks . as we shall see",
    "these couplings generate the ckm phase in the quark sector when @xmath2 is softly or spontaneously broken .",
    "however @xmath83-particles , with @xmath84 and majorana masses belong in the dark sector , do not couple to leptons and therefore do not generate @xmath2 violation in the leptonic sector .",
    "we now show this more concretely . under @xmath74 @xmath85 .",
    "as in  @xcite we impose @xmath2 and break it softly by dimension 3 terms , that are @xmath0 symmetric namely @xmath86    comparing the above with the last two terms of equation  ( [ eq : dark ] ) we see that unlike @xmath87 , @xmath88 couple to all the quark families with complex @xmath2 violating couplings @xmath89 .",
    "the mass of the vectorlike quarks @xmath90 can be any scale from just above the weak scale to the planck scale , while the complex phases in the ratios @xmath91 generate the ckm @xmath2 phases in the light @xmath92 sector when the heavier vectorlike quarks decouple  @xcite .",
    "also , since the terms in  ( [ eq : m_i ] ) do not break @xmath0 there is no @xmath93 generated by them at the tree - level .",
    "however we note that if the scalars @xmath43 and @xmath94 pick up complex vevs they can induce leptonic cp violation .",
    "but any complex vevs would break both @xmath0 and @xmath2 and give rise to @xmath93 .",
    "hence resolution of the strong @xmath2 problem and absence of leptonic @xmath2 phases are both linked to all higgs vevs being real .    though @xmath2 is broken softly by dimension 3 terms in  ( [ eq : m_i ] ) ,",
    "the only possible @xmath2 breaking term in the scalar potential with higgs content of table  [ tab : table1 ] is @xmath95 however @xmath96 is real due to @xmath0 and therefore does not break @xmath2 . since all terms in the higgs potential are real , the vevs can be naturally real thus solving the strong @xmath2 problem and predicting the absence of leptonic @xmath2 violation  @xcite ... that is the absence of tree - level dirac neutrino phase and majorana phases in the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix . the electron electric dipole moment ( edm )",
    "will also be unobservably small .",
    "another distinguishing feature of our model is that it can generate an observable neutron edm ( or equivalently @xmath93 ) in large regions of parameter space . in section  [ sec : masses ]",
    "we saw that the charge neutral @xmath83-particle would be automatically stable if @xmath97 . in a similar region of parameter space in the quark sector , that is for @xmath98 , as shown in  @xcite , the strong @xmath2 phase @xmath93 generated radiatively due to the up sector quarks is @xmath99 ^ 2 \\label{eq : theta_higgs}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 are the up and down hermitian yukawa matrices which are @xmath101 ( owing to the presence of the 4th vectorlike family ) .",
    "the above equation holds in the physical basis where the light @xmath92 down sector is diagonal ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "an important thing to note in the above equation is the suppression factor @xmath102 ^ 2 $ ] . due to this , even if the yukawa couplings involving the @xmath82 family are large like the third generation , @xmath93 can be within its experimental bounds .",
    "for example if the @xmath103 ( a scale hinted at , though not required by the observed neutrino mass - squared splittings ) , and @xmath104 then using equation  ( [ eq : theta_higgs ] ) we can see that radiative corrections generate @xmath105 to @xmath106 if @xmath107 .",
    "this is not only within the present bounds but also could be detected in the ongoing and future neutron edm experiments and is therefore exciting .",
    "this relevant example evaluating @xmath93 in the region @xmath98 , with well motivated mass - scales and large fourth generation yukawas was not provided in  @xcite .    for the other case @xmath108 , as shown in  @xcite , the suppression factor @xmath102 ^ 2 $ ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta_higgs ] ) is replaced by the logarithmic factor @xmath109 . in this case",
    "so that @xmath110 , the yukawa terms involving the fourth generation must be smaller than or at best equal to the first generation yukawas . moreover , an observable neutron edm with @xmath111 is expected to be generated  @xcite .",
    "this is interesting because the @xmath83-particle yukawas with the scalar bi - doublet had to be similarly small so as to kinematically stabilize the charge - neutral fermion in a similar region @xmath112 .",
    "before we proceed to non - minimal models , we note that while there is no leptonic cp violation in the minimal strong cp solving model , @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dark ] ) can be complex and the dark sector can contain a soft @xmath2 violating phase .      if we introduce an additional vectorlike lepton doublet family ( @xmath114 ) and provide it a real intrinsic parity @xmath115 , then it will couple to the usual families through an equation analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_i ] ) with @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath2 phases will be generated in the leptonic sector in this case , in a manner similar to that of the quark sector .",
    "this is essentially an extension in the fermionic sector that goes beyond what is minimally needed for dark matter and it gives rise to leptonic @xmath2 violation .",
    "however even in this case the electron edm does not get generated if there is no new physics ( other than possible dark matter physics ) at low enough energy scale .",
    "to see this , note that the neutron edm gets generated in the quark sector through @xmath93 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta_higgs ] ) ( with or without the suppression in the square brackets ) .",
    "whether the factor in the square brackets is there or not , this equation is independent of the weak scale ( @xmath118 ) , and in particular @xmath93 is not suppressed by factors such as @xmath119 or @xmath120 .",
    "however there is no analogous @xmath93 term in the leptonic sector to generate an electron edm .",
    "thus when new physics is high enough that it decouples , the electron edm would not receive any additional contribution beyond the small unobservable amount expected in the standard model .",
    "thus with an additional vectorlike leptonic family with intrinsic parity @xmath115 , @xmath2 phases are expected to be present in the pmns matrix but the electron edm may still not be generated .",
    "the presence of a measurable neutron edm and an absence of electron edm is not only consistent with our model but is also expected in a large region of parameter space , and considering the fact that no new physics beond the standard model has so far been discovered by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .    on the other hand adding more higgs fields beyond those in the minimal model , does not introduce leptonic @xmath2 violation even in the pmns matrix .",
    "for example , a singlet scalar  @xcite or a second higgs bi - doublet  @xcite can be added to break @xmath2 spontaneously instead of softly .",
    "however their vevs do not generate the strong @xmath2 phase , and due to the same reason do not also generate leptonic cp violation .",
    "adding @xmath83-particles as dark matter as we have done in this work , does not change this result as they do not couple to leptons .",
    "if @xmath2 violation is hard in nature as it is in the standard model ( through dimension 4 yukawa couplings ) , then all @xmath2 violating phases including all the leptonic phases are expected to be present at the tree level , since they would be generated during renormalization .",
    "however the prevailing view in the field seems to be more biased than this  that whether @xmath2 violation is hard _ or not _ , it is expected that leptonic @xmath2 phases are present .",
    "for example a recent review by branco et al  @xcite states :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _",

    "we showed that parity and quantum nature of the laws governing the universe may be at the heart of dark matter stability .",
    "dark matter can be matter with a relative purely imaginary intrinsic parity phase that can not be removed through field or parity symmetry redefinitions .",
    "if majorana terms are not present either for leptons or dark sector , there is enough symmetry to redefine @xmath0 and remove the relative purely imaginary intrinsic parity phase .",
    "we thus predict that neutrinos and neutral dark matter fermions must have majorana masses if dark matter is stable due to parity . further @xmath0 with @xmath2 solves the strong @xmath2 problem and predicts the vanishing of tree - level leptonic phases ( in the minimal model ) .",
    "if leptonic @xmath2 phases in the pmns matrix are not experimentally detected or are very small it would be consistent with @xmath2 being spontaneously or softly broken _ and _ there also being an additional hidden or softly broken symmetry in nature such as @xmath0 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "basically if the lagrangian of nature has @xmath2 symmetry then it must be violated softly and/or spontaneously to produce the ckm @xmath2 violating phase .",
    "if nature also has a second symmetry such as @xmath0 , @xmath5 , or @xmath6 ( or a flavour symmetry ) then this can ensure that while ckm phase is generated the strong @xmath2 phase and leptonic @xmath2 phases do not also get generated at the tree level . the same symmetry ( for example @xmath0 ) that protects the strong @xmath2 phase from getting generated",

    "moreover if leptonic cp violation is not detected , it would be a set back for axionic solutions , since the smallness of leptonic phases would also have to be explained , not just the strong cp phase .",
    "since leptonic @xmath2 violation can be generated radiatively , allowing at least a one - loop suppression , a conservative upper bound is that the induced leptonic phases in the pmns matrix are less than @xmath151 from the @xmath2 conserving values of @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "in fact they will be much lesser as there will also be suppression of radiative corrections due to the increasing scale of new physics .",
    "currently experiments are being planned or underway  @xcite to achieve a sensitivity of about @xmath152 .",
    "we also find that leptonic @xmath2 phases can be present in the pmns matrix in closely related or some non - minimal versions of these models , as @xmath12 or @xmath6 can then be imposed so that only the strong cp phase is protected from being generated at the tree level . however even in non - minimal cases , in the axionless strong cp solving model that uses @xmath0 and @xmath2 symmetries , the electric dipole moment of the electron will be immeasurably small if the scale of new physics is sufficiently high , while the neutron edm can be generated at detectable levels due to radiative corrections to the strong @xmath2 phase @xmath93 .",
    "for the case discussed in subsection  [ sec : majorana ] where the singlet majorana fermion @xmath72 is given an intrinsic parity @xmath153 , we can provide either @xmath154 or @xmath36 to the leptons , so that under @xmath155 . depending on the sign of @xmath156",
    "this will lead to two inequivalent lagrangians that conserve parity .",

    "we now show that the two lagrangians are physically inequivalent by examining the mass spectrum of the neutrinos for both cases , after the neutral components of the fields @xmath160 and @xmath41 pick up vevs @xmath161 and @xmath162 , and @xmath43 picks up vevs diag@xmath163 ( so that the weak scale @xmath164 ) .    to simplify the calculation we consider a toy model of @xmath2 conserving lagrangians with all real parameters , that can naturally have vevs that are also all real . using @xmath165 and @xmath40 invariance without loss of generality , we can now set @xmath161 and @xmath162 to be positive . making a further simplifying assumption that the lepton generations do not mix ,",
    "the mass matrices of the @xmath166 generation of neutrinos now has the well known seesaw form @xmath167f_ii v_l@xmath168m_d@xmath169m_d@xmath168f_ii v_r@xmath170 for @xmath157 ( due to eq .",

    "a similar result can be obtained for the model in subsection  [ sec : xparticles ] by calculating the mass spectrum of both the neutral @xmath179particles and neutrinos for lagrangians obtained using @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
