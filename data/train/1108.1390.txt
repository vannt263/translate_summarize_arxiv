    ",        the magnetic ground state is obtained from minimization of the free energy .",

    "the problem is solved numerically  the parameters @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 are adjusted to fit the field- and the angular dependence of the antiferromagnetic resonance modes .    in this mean - field approach",
    "all information about the interactions between spins within a particular sublattice is lost .",
    "therefore , a meaningful choice of sublattices is of great importance .",
    "the ferro - triangular magnetic order allows a restriction to six sublattices in each triangular plane , in order to account for the lowest lying magnon modes ( see fig .  1 in the main text for the site numbering ) .",
    "thus both the intratriangle exchange @xmath52 and the intertriangle exchange @xmath149 are taken into account .",

    "finally , to take into the account also the interlayer interactions ( @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) , we stacked 14 pairs of 1 - 3 and 1-3 triangles and used periodic boundary conditions , thus allowing for the experimental pitch of 2@xmath153/7 along the @xmath10-axis .",
    "the resulting magnetic ground state is a helix with the ordering vector @xmath154 .",
    "the plane of the helix will , however , be randomly oriented if @xmath48 is set to zero , thus resulting in a sinusoidal tilt ( along @xmath10 ) of spins on a given site from the @xmath10 axis .",
    "this remains the case if a finite in - plane dm component @xmath23 is present .",
    "adding a finite out - of - plane dm component @xmath22 aligns the helix plane with the crystallographic @xmath6 plane .",
    "the triangular chirality is found anti - parallel to the @xmath155 vector , thus minimizing the dm interaction energy .",
    "the helicity is always anti - parallel to the triangular chirality due to the left - handedness of the crystal structure imposing @xmath156 . in the si model , on the other hand , @xmath157 leaves the helix plane randomly oriented , while @xmath158 randomly imposes helix planes with their normals perpendicular to the @xmath10 axis . on the other hand ,",
    "spins are bound to @xmath6 planes for @xmath159 and/or @xmath160 , which , however , always select the state with positive triangular chirality ( and negative helicity ) .",
    "the afmr modes that suit the experimental observations best are plotted in fig .  4 of the main text for both anisotropy models .",
    "in zero field , the three lowest modes define the lowest two branches s@xmath94 and s@xmath70 , which are characterized by @xmath161 and a linear motion of spins .",
    "the crucial difference between the two anisotropy models is that in the dm model the s@xmath94 mode is the gapless goldstone mode and the two s@xmath70 modes occur at ( @xmath162  ghz ) . in the si model ,",
    "on the other hand , all three modes are gapped  a two - fold degenerate mode is found at @xmath163  ghz and the third mode at @xmath164  ghz .",
    "the small splitting is due to the fact that the si anisotropy in bnfso  is multi - axial ( see fig .  1 of the main text ) .",
    "if the magnetic helix was incommensurate a gapless goldstone mode would exist also in the si model , as there would be no energy cost in rotating the helix around its axis .",
    "the gapless mode is , however , absent for a commensurate helix .",
    "experiments imply the latter .",
    "namely , no changes in the propagation vector , which is a rational fraction of @xmath10 with small numerator and denominator co - primes , were detected in the temperature range of the ordered phase @xcite .",
    "this is not in line with the incommensurability , arising from a delicate balance between the exchange parameters @xmath165 , then subject to strong sensitivity on temperature @xcite .",
    "this then justifies the use of the finite lattice of 14 sites along the @xmath10 axis in our modeling .",
    "the zero - field gap to the lowest gapped mode opens in a square - root fashion ( fig .",
    "[ fig2s ] ) for both the dm and the si model .",
    "we have calculated the dependence of the gap also for symmetric anisotropic exchange ( ae ) @xmath166 where the sum runs over the nearest - neighbor fe pairs , and @xmath167 either corresponds to crystallographic @xmath10 direction or a general local direction with respect to the @xmath140 bond within the @xmath6 plane .",
    "similarly to other two models , in the ae model the square - root dependence of the gap is observed .",
    "moreover , all models predict a very similar size of the anisotropy @xmath168 , which is required to explain the gap .",

    "<S> the predicted non - monotonic dependence of the s@xmath1 mode is a consequence of a field - induced phase transition , occurring around 5.5  t @xcite for @xmath81 [ see the discontinuity of curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent absence of the transition at exactly @xmath82 is accidental , which can be deduced from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transition corresponds to the field where the lowest branch reaches zero frequency . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior was indeed observed and justified with the si model on another fe - based triangular lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of any irregularities in low - temperature magnetization isotherms speaks against such transition in bnfso at least up to 23  t @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that , on the other hand , no such excitation softening exists for the dm model [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) ] . finally , the si model predicts the selection of the @xmath83 gs independent of the structural chirality . </S>",
    "<S> this contradicts with the experimental observation of the @xmath84 gs in a crystal with structural left handedness @xcite , clearly making the si model incompetent of selecting the proper ground state . </S>",
    "<S> this selection is independent of the structural chirality , because it is a single - ion property .    </S>",
    "<S> the dm model [ eq .  ( [ eq3 ] ) ] , on the other hand , yields excellent agreement with the experiment for @xmath85  mk . both the @xmath86 diagram [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) ] and the finer - detail angular dependence of both afmr modes [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](d ) ] are simulated convincingly . </S>",
    "<S> the dm anisotropy @xmath22 explains the esr line width and the finite gap to the s@xmath70 branch . </S>",
    "<S> its relative size @xmath87 is in good agreement with the order - of - magnitude prediction @xmath88 , as derived by moriya @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the zero - field gap could also be explained by the presence of symmetric anisotropic exchange ( ae ) of a similar size @xmath89 @xcite . however , as the ae anisotropy results from the second order perturbation in @xmath90 ( while dm results from the first order perturbation ) , it is of the size @xcite @xmath91 and therefore negligible . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the in - plane dm component @xmath23 does not affect the detected lowest branches and can not be determined from the studies of these excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the above - presented x - band esr investigation , yielding @xmath92 , invaluable in determining also the @xmath93  mk dm component . </S>",
    "<S> there is a very good agreement between the excitations observed in esr and calculated with the dm model on one hand and the modes identified from the ins experiments @xcite on the other hand . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated s@xmath94 branch [ fig .  [ fig4](a ) ] is the gapless goldstone mode emerging at the origin of the reciprocal space ( scattering vector @xmath95=0 ) for the correlations of the @xmath10-axis spin components . </S>",
    "<S> the s@xmath70 mode corresponds to the other , gapped excitations for chiral correlations of the @xmath6-plane spin components at @xmath95=0 . </S>",
    "<S> these excitations at @xmath96 involve correlations of the @xmath10-axis spin - component @xcite and cross @xmath95=0 at @xmath97  ghz , yielding the s@xmath1 signal .    </S>",
    "<S> the dm anisotropy thus proves to be the origin of the unique magnetic properties of bnfso . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations @xcite further disclose that one of the two possible gs [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) ] is selected depending on the sign of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally detected gs @xmath84 is realized for @xmath98 , when the dm energy [ eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq3 ] ) ] is minimized . </S>",
    "<S> formation of a uniform vector chiral state at finite temperature is , however , challenged by formation of domain walls , which prosper on frustrated lattices due to thermal fluctuations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that these are responsible for diffuse neutron scattering coexisting with lro in bnfso far below @xmath19 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore striking that the minute @xmath3  mk term effectively imposes a single - domain gs at two orders of magnitude larger temperatures , as experimentally verified at 1.5  k @xcite , and a chiral unbalance up to t@xmath99 , with chiral correlations persisting even in the paramagnetic state @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the selection of the unique chiral magnetic ground state in bnfso is due to the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction as the dominant source of magnetic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> although this term is small ( @xmath3  mk , @xmath100  mk ) , it effectively overcomes thermal fluctuations and leads to a fully chiral state in structurally enantiopure crystals , whereas spin - liquid signatures might also be anticipated above @xmath19 , possibly with skyrmion texturation @xcite .    </S>",
