    "the supernova ( sn ) which occurred in 1987 in the nearby large magellanic cloud was the first object of its kind in modern times whose evolution could be spatially resolved as a function of time ; this includes the characterization of the progenitor star .",
    "sn  1987a has been extensively studied in all wavelengths from the radio to the @xmath1-ray range . for a summary of its global characteristics",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the properties and the future evolution of this supernova can be viewed from different physics points of view .",
    "the present work concentrates on the nonthermal characteristics and , in particular , on the particle acceleration aspects and the expected @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "it extends two earlier studies by @xcite , and by @xcite , hereafter referred to as bk , to include the subsequent chandra observations of the soft and hard x - ray emission @xcite , as well as the most recent and very detailed observations of the radio continuum emission by @xcite . at the same time",
    "a qualitative and in fact semi - quantitative prediction of the future nonthermal emission from this source for the next decades is attempted .",
    "the radio synchrotron emission and its spectral index are important for the determination of the nonthermal energy density in the source .",
    "in particular the softness of the observed radio synchrotron spectrum shows that the radio electrons are accelerated in a rather weak shock .",
    "this is the plasma subshock formed when the accelerated nuclei modify the supernova remnant ( snr ) blast wave by their pressure gradient , so that the main gas compression occurs in an extended cr precursor that does not accelerate radio electrons .",
    "this nonlinear modification determines the injection rate of the nuclear particles and vize versa ( see bk and section 3 ) .",
    "the new chandra data in addition suggest that the hard x - ray emission is predominantly nonthermal .",
    "since at the corresponding electron energies synchrotron losses are of overriding importance for the shaping of the x - ray synchrotron spectrum these new observations also determine the effective magnetic field strength in the source ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "it turns out that these recent observations can be consistently explained with only minor modifications of the previous theoretical considerations .",
    "in particular in can be shown that the circumstellar environment will lead to a further increase of the expected @xmath1-ray emission in the next decades by a modest factor of only about 2 , before the source will go into a steady emission decrease as the snr shock leaves the immediate circumstellar environment and propagates secularly into the progenitor star s unperturbed red supergiant ( rsg ) wind region .    in comparison with the other well - studied young ,",
    "resolved snr in the early sweep - up phase , which also exhibits nonthermal x - ray emission and a steep radio synchrotron spectrum , the galactic object g1.9 + 0.3 that is presumably the remnant of a type ia sn in an essentially uniform interstellar medium ( ism ) , sn  1987a has a complex immediate circumstellar environment due to the interactions of its latest wind phases and the stellar radiation field before the explosion .",
    "this leads to a very non - uniform density structure interior to the stellar wind bubble formed by the progenitor in its rsg phase .",
    "therefore g1.9 + 0.3 and sn  1987a presumably constitute the extremes of spatially resolved pre - supernova circumstellar environments when studying the particle acceleration properties of extremely young snrs . to this extent",
    "the present work is complementary to the analysis of the nonthermal properties of g1.9 + 0.3 @xcite .",
    "as one might expect on physics grounds , it turns out that in both cases the sn blast wave is already strongly modified by the accelerated particles  mainly atomic nuclei , called here cosmic rays ( crs )  from the very beginning of snr formation , although the total amount of nonthermal energy , like that of thermal energy , is still only a percent fraction of the total explosion energy .",
    "this shock modification is associated with a strong amplification of the magnetic field strength in the swept - up circumstellar material .",
    "these conclusions are derived from the following observations : ( i ) the existence of nonthermal x - ray emission ( see section 4 ) , ( ii ) the rapid increase of the radio emission ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent analysis of the radio light curve for g1.9 + 0.3 ) , and ( iii ) the anomalously soft radio emission spectra ( bk ,  @xcite ) . in both cases",
    "these evidences come from the observed properties of synchrotron emission produced by the electron cr component .",
    "the electron component therefore plays a fundamental role , permitting indirect conclusions about key properties of the nuclear energetic particle component , like its pressure and its amplification of the magnetic field .",
    "given the diffuse radiation field , the inverse compton gamma - ray emission by the electrons is then also determined , and a measurement of the total gamma - ray emission yields the hadronic gamma - ray component",
    ".    sn  1987a and g1.9 + 0.3 are nevertheless distinct from other young historic galactic snrs like the core collapse object rx j1713.7 + 3946 and the type ia object sn  1006 , respectively , in that the latter snrs have already swept up an amount of circumstellar matter that is approximately equal to the ejected mass .",
    "therefore they are expected by a number of authors to already contain an amount of nonthermal particle energy that corresponds to some 10 % of the total hydrodynamic explosion energy @xcite .    as a consequence of the softer effective equation of state of the combined gas - cr system",
    "the dynamical evolution in this phase is different from that of a purely gas dynamic system .",
    "also the increasing dissipation of hydromagnetic fluctuation fields will presumably influence the system @xcite , not to speak of an early onset of radiative gas cooling as a result of the increased gas compression in the interior that is higher than the purely gas dynamic ratio of 4 @xcite .",
    "the observed shape of the remnant , especially at radio frequencies is not very far from spherically symmetric , even though the observed emission varies around the remnant s periphery @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a spherically symmetric model is a reasonable first order approximation for a study of the general nonthermal properties of the remnant .    in the next section an approximate spherically symmetric model of the pre - explosion environment of sn  1987a",
    "is formulated .",
    "this is combined in section 3 with a theoretical , spherically symmetric , nonlinear model for the nonthermal evolution , using the earlier work of bk , and with the recent observations of the synchrotron emission , mentioned before .",
    "the results are presented in section 4 and summarized in section 5 .",
    "the initial short outburst of radio emission @xcite has been attributed to the synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated by the sn shock propagating in the free wind of the blue supergiant ( bsg ) progenitor star @xcite .",
    "after about 3 years radio emission was detected again @xcite , as well as a monotonically increasing x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "this second increase of emission has then been attributed to the entrance of the outer sn shock into the wind bubble of the bsg of density @xmath5 , thermalized in a termination shock at a radial distance @xmath6  cm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and subsequently into an h  ii region of much denser matter , consisting of the swept - up wind of a rsg precursor phase @xcite .",
    "the density @xmath7 of the swept - up rsg wind region is large compared to @xmath5 .",
    "the contact discontinuity between the two winds is assumed at @xmath8  cm , the scale @xmath9 of a modeled smooth transition is assumed as @xmath10 .",
    "these parameters are consistent with canonical values of stellar ejecta mass @xmath11 , distance @xmath12  kpc , and hydrodynamic explosion energy @xmath13  erg ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "during an initial period the ejecta material has a broad distribution in velocity @xmath14 .",
    "the fastest part of this distribution can be described by a power law @xmath15 .",
    "the present modeling uses a value @xmath16 appropriate for sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "the general picture is that the interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar medium ( csm ) creates a strong shock there which heats the thermal gas and accelerates particles diffusively to a nonthermal cr component of comparable energy density .",
    "according to @xcite the csm at @xmath17 includes three subsequent regions : the h  ii region , an equatorial ring and , beyond the ring , a free rsg wind ( followed further out by a rarefied main sequence wind bubble which is of no concern here ) . neither the contact discontinuity between the two winds is in reality a spherical surface at radius @xmath18 , nor is the equatorial ring a spherical shell , as the optical observations clearly indicate @xcite",
    "nevertheless , the present nonthermal model approximates the mass distribution @xmath19 within the ring by a spherically symmetric shell @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the central ( maximal ) density of the shell ; @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the total mass , the radius and the width of the shell , respectively .",
    "below , the values @xmath25  cm and @xmath26 are used .",
    "approximately @xmath24 corresponds to the interval of radial distances where the dense cool shell , associated with the equatorial ring , is positioned around the source @xcite .    in the same spirit ,",
    "the density profile of the rsg matter consists of three corresponding terms : @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the heaviside function .",
    "this results in the following model for the csm density distribution at the distances @xmath29 in the form @xmath30 for the gas number density @xmath31 the following values are adopted : @xmath32  @xmath33 , @xmath34  @xmath33 , where @xmath35 is the mass of proton .",
    "these values , as was shown by bk , provide a good compromise between the sn shock dynamics seen in the radio and x - ray emissions .",
    "since the density of the free rsg wind can be expressed in the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the rsg mass loss rate and @xmath38 denotes the rsg wind speed , the mass of the shell can be expressed in the form @xmath39 it is assumed that the center of the spherically smoothed ring is positioned exactly at the boundary @xmath40 between the hii region and the free rsg wind region .",
    "according to @xcite the rsg mass loss rate @xmath37 is highly nonuniform : it is @xmath41  yr@xmath4 in the equatorial region within @xmath42 , and @xmath43 yr@xmath4 in all other directions . in the present spherically symmetric approximation its average value is then @xmath44 yr@xmath4 .    for the conventional value @xmath45  km s@xmath4 of the rsg wind speed the masses of the shell is @xmath46 .",
    "to describe the observed properties of nonthermal emission of sn  1987a a nonlinear kinetic theory is used here .",
    "it couples the particle acceleration process with the hydrodynamics of the thermal gas @xcite .",
    "therefore , in a spherically symmetric approach it is able to predict the evolution of gas density , pressure , mass velocity , together with the energy spectrum and the spatial distribution of cr nuclei and electrons at any given evolutionary epoch @xmath47 , and the properties of the nonthermal radiation produced in snrs due to these accelerated particles .",
    "the model does not contain the reverse shock propagating in the sn ejecta .",
    "the reverse shock is not expected to be an efficient cr accelerator , because the magnetic field value is expected to be very weak as a result of the large expansion of the exploded stellar material that leads to inefficient high energy cr acceleration . even if one assume equally efficient cr injection / acceleration on the forward and the reverse shock , the expected energy content of crs accelerated by the forward shock is considerably larger compared with the reverse shock except during the transition phase from the free expansion to the sedov snr phase ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) . since sn  1987a is still far from the sedov phase one can neglect the contribution of the reverse shock to the nonthermal emission of the remnant .",
    "in addition the analysis of the observed fine structure of the x - ray and the radio emission @xcite gives evidence that they are produced by the forward shock ( blast wave ) .    in the particle acceleration model",
    "the scattering properties of the csm are required .",
    "given the enormous shock velocities in excess of @xmath48  km s@xmath4 ( see next section ) , bohm diffusion appears a most reasonable approximation .",
    "it was also used by bk . in this limiting case",
    "the scattering mean free path equals the particle gyro radius and is therefore inversely proportional to the mean magnetic field strength @xmath49 .",
    "a rather high downstream magnetic field strength @xmath50  mg is required to reproduce the observed radio and x - ray spectra ( bk ) .",
    "it is far from obvious that the dynamical interaction of the rsg and bsg wind systems , responsible for the inferred circumstellar structure , can also lead to such high magnetic field strengths .",
    "it is much more likely that the required strength of the magnetic field has to be attributed to nonlinear field amplification at the sn shock by the cr acceleration process itself . according to plasma physical considerations going back to @xcite and @xcite , the existing csm magnetic field",
    "can indeed be significantly amplified at a strong shock by cr streaming instabilities .",
    "in fact , for all the thoroughly studied young snrs , the ratio of magnetic field energy density @xmath51 in the upstream region of the shock precursor to the cr pressure @xmath52 is about the same @xcite . here",
    "@xmath53 is the far upstream field in the precursor , presumably amplified by the energetically dominant crs of the highest energy . within an error of about 50 percent the empirical relation",
    "@xmath54 holds , where @xmath55 denotes the sn shock speed .",
    "this is quantitatively close to the above - mentioned field value .",
    "this is the same field value as used by bk .",
    "the factor @xmath56 instead of @xmath57 in eq.(4 ) of bk is simply a misprint : this is clearly seen from a comparison of fig.1 of bk with fig.1 of the present paper .    for the following it",
    "is assumed that this relation also holds for an individual young source like sn  1987a during its temporal evolution , where @xmath58 depends on the source age @xmath47 .",
    "for time scales of the order of the propagation time of the shock through the shock precursor , i.e. about @xmath59 of the system age ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this appears as a reasonable approximation .",
    "as reviewed earlier @xcite , and elaborated most recently in detail @xcite , the key parameters of the theoretical model ( proton injection rate @xmath60 and electron to proton ratio @xmath61 below the synchrotron cooling range ) can be determined in a semi - empirical way from a fit of the nonlinear theoretical solution to the observed synchrotron emission spectrum . for the sake of simplicity the values of these parameters",
    "are usually assumed to be constant during snr evolution .",
    "also bk proceeded in this way .",
    "the present paper assumes such a simplification to be the main reason why a corresponding theoretical model fits the data only on average .",
    "this concerns the shape of the radio spectrum and the time - dependence of the radio flux over an extended period of snr evolution @xcite . in the case of sn  1987a , on the other hand ,",
    "it is natural to expect substantial time - variations of these injection parameters since the sn shock propagates through a strongly nonuniform csm whose physical parameters at the shock front are expected to change in time .",
    "therefore , in contrast to bk , time dependent injection parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 will be admitted here .",
    "their values are determined from the fit to the measured synchrotron data .",
    "the main physical factor which determines the injection efficiency @xmath62 is the structure of the magnetic field upstream of the shock .",
    "injection is expected to be progressively less efficient when the magnetic field component tangential to the shock surface becomes more relevant @xcite .",
    "such a situation is expected in the most compressed csm region , that is , in the ring region .",
    "it is important to note that a reliable semi - empirical estimate for the values of these parameters for any given snr evolutionary phase is possible if the measured synchrotron spectra in the radio and x - ray bands are available for this particular phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for sn  1987a good quality measurements of the radio spectrum , as well as of the x - ray fluxes in the soft ( 0.52 kev ) and",
    "the hard ( 310 kev ) energy ranges exist now for the full evolutionary period ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the remaining problem is that the nature of the observed x - ray emission of sn  1987a is not known unequivocally . in the extreme case , when only an upper limit for the nonthermal ( synchrotron ) emission is known , the data yield only a lower limit for the magnetic field strength @xmath64 and a corresponding value of the electron to proton ratio ( bk ) .",
    "it is , however , noted here that the time dependence of the hard x - ray flux differs from that of the soft x - ray flux , and that it is very close to the time dependence of the radio emission flux .",
    "this fact can be interpreted as evidence that the hard x - ray emission is predominantly of a nonthermal nature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the considerations below are based on this interpretation .",
    "the present model calculations start at the snr evolutionary epoch @xmath65  d , when the outer sn shock has reached a radius @xmath66 and a speed @xmath67  km s@xmath4 .",
    "these values of @xmath68 and @xmath55 correspond to the end of the sn shock propagation in the free bsg wind region @xmath69 ( bk ) .",
    "the contribution of crs accelerated in the region @xmath69 is neglected , because the number of crs produced in the region @xmath29 becomes dominant very soon , because of the high gas density there .",
    "the calculated shock radius @xmath68 and shock speed @xmath55 , shown in fig.[f1 ] as a function of time , are in satisfactory agreement with the values obtained on the basis of radio measurements . up to the year 2030",
    "the shock speed decreases due to the increase of the csm density and then , after crossing the maximal csm density , it increases again from @xmath70  km s@xmath4 to @xmath71  km s@xmath4 .",
    "the reason for this unexpected behavior is that during the whole time period under consideration the swept - up mass is much lower than the ejecta mass @xmath72 .",
    "therefore the main fraction of the explosion energy is contained in the freely expanding ejecta . on a small time",
    "scale the shock is driven by the downstream overpressure : each local relatively sharp increase of the csm density leads to a temporal decrease of the shock speed that keeps @xmath73 constant .",
    "however , on a larger time scale the shock is piston driven .",
    "note that the actual csm is essentially non - spherically symmetric during the time period considered . despite of this situation the piston - driven shock is expected to be roughly spherical .",
    "this supports the spherically symmetric approach used here .",
    "the fit of the theoretical solution to the synchrotron spectra , as measured in the radio and x - ray ranges up to the year 2008 @xcite , yields estimates for the proton injection rate @xmath62 and for the electron - to - proton ratio @xmath63 .",
    "this is shown in fig.[f2 ] .",
    "the fit procedure was described in detail for similar cases @xcite .",
    "the required proton injection rate @xmath74 leads to a significant nonlinear modification of the shock : as can be seen in fig.[f2 ] the total shock compression ratio @xmath75 is essentially larger , and the subshock compression ratio @xmath76 is lower than the classical value of 4 for a pure gas shock .",
    "fig.[f2 ] also shows that the proton injection rate @xmath60 changes during the snr evolution , so that it has a local minimum at an age of about @xmath77  yr .",
    "this is required in order to fit the observed radio emission spectra , which are becoming somewhat harder than a spectrum calculated with an unchanged injection rate - at least up to the present time . during the period from @xmath78",
    "yr to @xmath79  yr , i.e. beyond the present epoch of radio observations , the shock is within the dense shell that corresponds to the observed equatorial ring . in this spatial region",
    "the magnetic field is expected to have an enhanced tangential component which should depress the nuclear injection rate .",
    "thereafter the injection rate is a priori unknown .",
    "it may increase again to the same level @xmath74 .",
    "this is one of the possibilities calculated below ( so - called high proton injection rate ) .",
    "however , since the magnetic field vector in the free rsg wind is dominated by a component tangential to the snr shock also the possibility of a continuing depressed injection ( so - called low proton injection rate ) at a level similar to the value @xmath80 within the ring region is considered .",
    "the higher injection rate yields for @xmath81  yr a correspondingly larger shock modification , characterized by a larger shock compression ratio @xmath82 and a lower subshock compression ratio @xmath83 ( fig.[f2 ] ) .",
    "the strongly modified snr shock generates a cr spectrum @xmath84 , which is very soft at momenta @xmath85 , with index @xmath86 .",
    "cr electrons with such a spectrum produce a radio synchrotron emission spectrum @xmath87 with spectral index @xmath88 , that corresponds very well to the observations , as can be seen in fig.[f3 ] , where the synchrotron spectral energy density @xmath89 is calculated for five successive epochs together with the experimental data .",
    "the assumed time variation of the proton injection rate @xmath60 leads to a time dependence of the radio spectral index @xmath90 as shown in fig.[f4 ] , and it provides a better fit of the observations @xcite compared with the case of constant @xmath60 ( bk ) .",
    "in fact the adopted injection rate @xmath62 at @xmath91  yr is the result of the fit to the radio synchrotron spectrum .",
    "for the future , @xmath81  yr , the slope of the radio synchrotron spectrum is expected to be nearly the same if the proton injection remains constant at @xmath92 ( fig.[f4 ] ) .",
    "it is expected to become progressively steeper due to the decrease of the subshock compression ratio @xmath93 in case the proton injection rate increases again to the level @xmath94 .    the strong downstream magnetic field @xmath95  mg leads to synchrotron cooling of the electrons with momenta @xmath96 .",
    "this makes the high energy part of the synchrotron spectrum ( @xmath97  hz ) very soft ( see fig.[f3 ] ) . at higher frequencies",
    "( @xmath98  hz ) the synchrotron spectrum becomes harder , possibly due to a pile - up effect .",
    "it hardens the spectrum of accelerated electrons , that undergo strong synchrotron losses , just near its exponential cutoff ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under this condition",
    "the calculated synchrotron flux at frequency @xmath99  hz , which corresponds to a photon energy @xmath100  kev , is below the measured flux ( see fig.[f3 ] ) .",
    "this is a required condition because at energies @xmath101  kev the x - ray emission of sn  1987a is dominated by lines and is therefore mainly of thermal origin . at higher energies @xmath102  kev x - rays are presumably of a predominant nonthermal origin .",
    "therefore the fit of the measured x - ray flux for @xmath103  kev was used in the determination of the values of the injection parameters ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) and of the amplified magnetic field @xmath64 at the beginning of the shock precursor .    the less modified shock corresponding to a low injection rate during the future epoch @xmath81  yr yields lower cooling of electrons due to the lower downstream magnetic field on account of the lower overall compression ratio .",
    "this leads to a considerably flatter high - energy part of the synchrotron spectrum ( @xmath97  hz ) .",
    "the calculated @xmath1-ray integral spectral energy flux density ( sed ) , shown in fig.[f5 ] , is dominated by the @xmath104-decay component at all energies .",
    "it is important to note here that the hadronic sed has nevertheless been renormalized by a factor @xmath105 compared to the amplitude resulting from the spherically symmetric model on which the entire calculation is predicated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the reason for this a posteriori correction is the fact that the circumstellar environment is characterized by a archimedean spiral topology , both in the bsg as well as in the rsg wind bubble environment . in particular the radiative cooling and the ionization by the stellar radiation field of the progenitor star will make the entire interaction region of these successive wind phases highly turbulent",
    ". therefore there will always be regions where the snr is quasi - parallel , that is to say , regions where the shock normal will make an relatively small angle with the local upstream magnetic field direction . only in these quasi - parallel shock regions nuclear particles",
    "can be effectively injected into the diffusive acceleration process . however , as a consequence of the overall archimedean spiral topology , the total solid angle of these quasi - parallel shock segments will be @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is considerably smaller than unity . following previous estimates @xcite @xmath105",
    "is used in this paper , but the actual value of @xmath107 may be even smaller . the corresponding uncertainty in the amplitude of the @xmath1-ray energy flux remains .",
    "since the sn shock is strongly modified the @xmath1-ray spectrum at energies @xmath108  tev is very hard : @xmath109 . at the current epoch",
    "the expected @xmath1-ray energy flux at tev - energies is about @xmath2  erg @xmath110 s@xmath4 .",
    "and during the next 20 years it is expected to grow by a factor of about two with a subsequent temporal decrease @xmath111 due to the rapid spatial decrease of the csm density @xmath112 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".    at present there exist only upper limits for the tev emission .",
    "they have been obtained by the cangaroo @xcite and h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite instruments ( see fig.[f5 ] ) .",
    "the latest h.e.s.s .",
    "upper limit is quite close to the sed estimated above .",
    "even with the reservations formulated above , this is remarkable and justifies in the view of the present authors a deep observation of this object .",
    "the expected time profile @xmath113 is sensitive to the radial profile of the actual csm density distribution .",
    "if the dense shell , which in the spherically symmetric model represents the matter contained in the equatorial ring , is situated at a larger distance , say at @xmath114 , the peak of @xmath1-ray flux is expected to occur 10 years later , with an amplitude that is by a factor of 1.3 lower than in the former case .",
    "it is clear from the above consideration that the proton injection rate @xmath60 ( whose value influences the efficiency of cr production ) can be estimated from the observed shape of the radio emission .",
    "since it is not possible to predict the values of @xmath60 for the future evolutionary epochs , the presented prediction for the corresponding gamma - ray emission is uncertain .",
    "note however that this kind of uncertainty is not very big due to the following reasons .",
    "first of all , it is hard to expect that the shape of the radio spectrum will be much more rapidly changing during the next 20 - 30 years than during the previous epochs .",
    "therefore the predictions based on the recently determined value of @xmath60 should be roughly valid also for this period of time .",
    "secondly , the shape of the cr spectrum is strongly sensitive to the injection rate at low energies @xmath115 .",
    "since the radio synchrotron emission is produced by electrons with such energies it is sensitive to the expected injection rate ( fig.[f3],[f4 ] ) .",
    "the high - energy part of the cr spectrum @xmath116 is less sensitive to @xmath60 : variations of @xmath60 by a factor of three at the epoch @xmath117  yr ( see fig.[f2 ] ) only lead to a variation of the cr pressure @xmath118 by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "since the cr pressure is dominated by the highest energy crs one should expect a corresponding variation of the high energy gamma - ray emission .",
    "this is indeed seen from fig.[f5 ] : for @xmath117  yrs the expected gamma - ray flux at energies @xmath119  tev for low injection rate is lower by a factor @xmath120 compared with the case of high injection .",
    "therefore , taking into account the uncertainties of all relevant parameter values we expect that the prediction for the tev - emission is uncertain at best by a the factor of two ( fig.[f5 ] ) .",
    "a kinetic nonlinear model for cr acceleration in snrs has been applied in detail to sn  1987a , in order to compare its results with observed properties .",
    "it is found that quite reasonable consistency with most of the observational data can be achieved .",
    "the evidence for efficient cr production , leading to a strong modification of the shock , comes from the radio synchrotron data .",
    "a proton injection rate of size @xmath121 is required to produce a significant shock modification that leads to the steep spectrum of energetic electrons which fits the observed synchrotron spectrum very well .",
    "the condition is an extremely high downstream magnetic field strength @xmath122  mg . such a high field implies significant synchrotron losses of cr electrons emitting nonthermal x - rays .",
    "this makes the high frequency part of the synchrotron spectrum much softer and is consistent with the high - energy part of the x - ray spectrum , which is presumably of nonthermal origin .",
    "therefore the fit of the synchrotron spectrum gives a good estimate for the cr injection parameters and makes it possible to calculate the expected @xmath1-ray flux in a spherically symmetric model .",
    "however , the basic tendency of the magnetic field vectors to form an archimedean spiral configuration in the circumstellar wind interaction region requires a renormalization of the overall @xmath1-ray flux .",
    "this a posteriori reduction by a factor @xmath123 is chosen following the previous analyses of other snrs .",
    "this introduces an acknowledged uncertainty in the predicted overall @xmath1-ray flux .",
    "since the sn shock interacts with the cool shell which is the densest part of the csm , the @xmath104-decay @xmath1-ray spectral energy flux density at the current epoch is already quite high @xmath124  erg @xmath110 s@xmath4 at energies @xmath125  tev . depending upon the details of the csm distribution during the next 1520",
    "yr the @xmath1-ray flux is expected to increase roughly by a factor of two .",
    "the further temporal evolution of the gamma - ray emission corresponds to a secular decrease because the gas density in the unperturbed red supergiant wind region decreases with radius @xmath126 .",

    "<S> a nonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic ray ( cr ) acceleration in supernova remnants is employed to re - examine the nonthermal properties of the remnant of sn  1987a for an extended evolutionary period of 5100 yr . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that an efficient production of nuclear crs leads to a strong modification of the outer supernova remnant shock and to a large downstream magnetic field @xmath0  mg . </S>",
    "<S> the shock modification and the strong field are required to yield the steep radio emission spectrum observed , as well as to considerable synchrotron cooling of high energy electrons which diminishes their x - ray synchrotron flux . </S>",
    "<S> these features are also consistent with the existing x - ray observations . </S>",
    "<S> the expected @xmath1-ray energy flux at tev - energies at the current epoch is nearly @xmath2  erg @xmath3s@xmath4 under reasonable assumptions about the overall magnetic field topology and the turbulent perturbations of this field . </S>",
    "<S> the general nonthermal strength of the source is expected to increase roughly by a factor of two over the next 15 to 20 yrs ; thereafter it should decrease with time in a secular form . </S>"
