    "the earth orientation is generally considered as ( i ) earth rotation axis movements in space ( precession - nutation ) , ( ii ) earth rotation axis movements in the earth ( polar motion ) , or ( iii ) earth rotation speed variations ( exces in the length of the day ) .",
    "these movements come from earth inside masses distributions .",
    "the earth gravity field can give us information about this distribution of masses because nowadays we can determine the variations of the earth gravity field by space geodetic techniques .",
    "hence , there is a link between the variations of the earth gravity field and the variations of the earth orientation parameters . and",
    "the high accuracy now reached in the vlbi ( very long baseline interferometry ) earth orientation parameters ( eop ) determination requires looking further at the various geophysical contributions to variations in eop .",
    "so we investigate here if this variable gravity field can be valuable for the improving the modelisation of the earth rotation .",
    "the fundamental equations for the rotation of the earth in an inertial frame are euler s dynamical equations , based on the conservation of the angular momentum @xmath0 of the earth under an external torque @xmath1 ( lambeck 1980 ) : @xmath2 for a non - rigid earth , these equations in a rotating frame become : @xmath3 + \\vec \\omega \\wedge \\left [ i(t)~\\vec \\omega + \\vec h(t)\\right ] = \\vec l\\ ] ] where the inertia tensor @xmath4 is time dependent , as well as the relative angular momentum @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the earth instantaneous rotation vector which direction is the one of the rotation axis and which norm is the rotation speed .",
    "it depends on the earth orientation parameters ( eop ) .",
    "the inertia tensor , which is symetric , can be written as : @xmath7 =   \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } a+c_{11 }   &   c_{12 }     &   c_{13 }    \\\\ c_{12 }     &   b+c_{22 }   &   c_{23 }    \\\\ c_{13 }     &   c_{23 }     &   c+c_{33 } \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ] with @xmath8 the constant part and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) the variable part of the inertia tensor .",
    "the earth gravity field of the earth devived from the external gravitational potential @xmath11 which is expressed in a spherical harmonic expansion as ( lambeck 1980 ) : @xmath12\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the geocentric distance , @xmath14 the latitude and @xmath15 the longitude of the point at which @xmath11 is detremined .",
    "@xmath16 is the gravitational constant , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mass and the equatorial radius of the earth , respectively . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the stokes coefficients of degree @xmath21 and order @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the legendre polynomials . hence the second - degree stokes coefficients can be directely related to the inertia tensor components ( lambeck , 1988 ) : @xmath24",
    "we just have shown that the earth rotation ( with @xmath6 and the eop ) could be related to the earth gravity field ( with the degree 2 stokes coefficients ) .",
    "then , we investigate now how we can link each eop with these coefficients .",
    "the exces in the length of the day @xmath25 ( with respect to a mean lod ) can be related to ( i ) the third component @xmath26 of the variable part of the inertia tensor and ( ii ) the third component @xmath27 of the relative angular momentum of the earth , ignoring the external torques : @xmath28 moreover , with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq : coeffs_c_inertie ] ) , we can write : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the variation in time of the sum of the diagonal elements of the inertia tensor .",
    "we can consider that it is equal to zero ( rochester & smylie 1974 ) .",
    "then , we can obtain : @xmath31 where the coefficient @xmath32 accounts for the loading effects and @xmath33 is the third moment of inertia of the earth s mantle ( barnes et al .",
    "then we have compared the @xmath25 obtained with eq .",
    "( [ eq : lod_fin ] ) and the @xmath34 data in fig .",
    "[ fig : bourda_fig2 ] with the one usually used but corrected from zonal tides , atmopheric wind effects ( @xmath27 ) and long terms ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bourda_fig1 ] ) .",
    "the study of the earth precession nutation angles variations influenced by the temporal variations of the @xmath35 coefficients of the geopotential is developped in the article of bourda & capitaine ( 2004 ) .",
    "it is based on the works of williams ( 1994 ) and capitaine et al .",
    "( 2003 ) which considered secular terms for the @xmath35 variations , whereas we consider also annual and semi - annual ones .      the polar motion @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the components of the rotation axis in space can be theoretically related to the degree 2 and order 1 coefficients of the earth gravity field : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is related to @xmath41 and @xmath42 with eq .",
    "( [ eq : coeffs_c_inertie ] ) , and @xmath43 .",
    "the part of the length of the day obtained with the @xmath34 data corresponds to gravitational terms .",
    "then we have compared @xmath25 corrected from the movements terms ( as atmospheric ones ) , the zonal tides and the decadal terms ( from magnetic effects in the core - mantle boundary ) .",
    "but the residual term has an amplitude of the order of @xmath44 @xmath45s , whereas the better precision on these lod data is of the order of @xmath46 @xmath45s .",
