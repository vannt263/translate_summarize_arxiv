    "usually we would simply compare the flux of a compact component on a high - res image with the total flux in order to estimate the flux fraction emitted by the compact component .",
    "however , we remove the alma data at @xmath79-distances @xmath95k@xmath78 in order to sharpen the synthesized beam , so we need to take into account any missing flux . in this paper , then , we compare fluxes measured using imfit on the high - res alma images with fluxes expected at a @xmath79-distance of @xmath96k@xmath78 . we adopt the fluxes measured at a @xmath79-distance of @xmath97k@xmath78 ( figure  [ fig : uvamp ] ) as the flux expected for the measured size .",
