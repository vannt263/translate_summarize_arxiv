    "in comparison with a central region of very small rapidities , @xmath2 , the forward rapidity region allows to study processes corresponding to much higher initial energies accessible at mid rapidities .",
    "if a particle with mass @xmath3 and transverse momentum @xmath1 is produced in a hard reaction then the corresponding values of bjorken variable in the beam and the target are @xmath4 .",
    "thus , at forward rapidities the target @xmath5 is @xmath6- times smaller than at mid rapidities .",
    "this allows to study already at rhic coherence phenomena ( shadowing , color glass condensate ( cgc ) ) , which are expected to suppress particle yields .",
    "forward rapidity physics , manifested itself as a strong nuclear suppression , has been already investigated in variety of processes at different energies : in production of different species of particles in @xmath7 collisions @xcite , in charge pion @xcite and charmonium production @xcite at sps , in the drell - yan process and charmonium production at fermilab @xcite and later on at larger rhic energies by measurements of high-@xmath1 particles in @xmath8 collisions @xcite .",
    "althought forward rapidity region at rhic allows to investigate small-@xmath9 coherence phenomena , one should be carreful with interpretation of observed suppression .",
    "such a suppression is arisen globally for any reaction studied so far at any energy .",
    "namely , all fixed target experiments have too low energy for the onset of coherence effects since @xmath5 is not small .",
    "the rise of suppression with @xmath10 ( with feynman @xmath0 ) shows the same pattern as observed at rhic .",
    "this universality of suppression favors also another mechanism which should be common for all reactions studied at any energy .",
    "such a mechanism was proposed in @xcite and allows to describe a strong suppression via energy conservation effects in initial state parton rescatterings .",
    "it can be also interpreted alternatively as a parton effective energy loss proportional to initial energy leading so to @xmath0 scaling of nuclear effects .",
    "the projectile hadron can be decomposed over different fock states .",
    "a nucleus has a higher resolution than a proton due to multiple interactions and so can resolve higher fock components containing more constituents .",
    "corresponding parton distributions fall off steeper at @xmath11 where any hard reaction can be treated as a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) process where no particle is produced within rapidity interval @xmath12 .",
