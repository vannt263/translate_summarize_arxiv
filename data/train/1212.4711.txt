    "the concept of entropy per unit time was introduced by shannon @xcite , by analogy with the standard boltzmann entropy measuring a spatial disorder in a thermodynamic system . in 1950s , kolmogorov @xcite and sinai established a rigorous definition of k - s entropy per unit time for dynamical systems and other random processes @xcite .",
    "kolmogorov imported shannon s probabilistic notion of entropy into the theory of dynamical systems , and the idea was vindicated later by ornstein who showed that metric entropy suffices to completely classify two - sided bernoulli processes @xcite , a basic problem which for many decades appeared completely intractable .",
    "kolmogorov s metric entropy is an invariant of measure theoretical dynamical systems and is closely related to shannon s source entropy .",
    "the k - s entropy is a powerful concept because it controls the top of the hierarchy of ergodic properties : k - s property @xmath12 multiple mixing @xmath12 mixing @xmath12 weak mixing @xmath12 ergodicity @xcite .",
    "the k - s property holds if there exists a subalgebra of measurable sets in phase space which generates the whole algebra by application of the flow @xcite .",
    "the dynamical randomness of a deterministic system finds its origin in the dynamical instability and the sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "in fact , the k - s entropy is related to the lyapunov exponents according to a generalization of pesin s theorem @xcite .",
    "a deterministic system with a finite number of degrees of freedom is chaotic if its k - s entropy per unit time is positive .",
    "more properties about k - s entropy can be found in papers @xcite .",
    "the concept of space - time entropy or entropy per unit time and unit volume was later introduced by sinai and chernov @xcite .",
    "a spatially extended system with a probability measure being invariant under space and time translations can be said to be chaotic if its space - time entropy is positive .      in 1965 ,",
    "adler , konheim and mcandrew introduced the concept of topological entropy for continuous mappings defined on compact spaces @xcite , which is an analogous invariant under conjugation of topological dynamical systems and can be obtained by maximizing the metric entropy over a suitable class of measures defined on a dynamical system , implying that topological entropy and measure - theoretic entropy are closely related .",
    "motivated by a conjecture of adler , konheim and mcandrew , goodwyn in 1969 and 1971 compared topological entropy and measure - theoretic entropy and concluded that topological entropy bounds measure - theoretic entropy @xcite .",
    "bowen in 1970 studied topological entropy and axiom a @xcite , and generalized the concept of topological entropy to continuous mappings defined on metric spaces and proved that his definition coincides with that of adler , konheim and mcandrew s within the class of compact metric spaces . in 1971 , bowen also considered the entropy for non - compact sets and for group endomorphisms and homogeneous spaces respectively @xcite .",
    "however , the entropy according to bowen s definition is metric - dependent ( @xcite , walters book , p.169 ) and can be positive even for a linear function ( walters book , p.176 ) . in 1973 , along with a study of measure - theoretic entropy , bowen in @xcite gave another definition of topological entropy resembling hausdorff dimension , which also equals to the topological entropy defined by adler , konheim and mcandrew when the space is compact .",
    "recently , liu , wang and wei , canovas and rodriguez , malziri , and molaci proposed other definitions of topological entropy for continuous mappings defined on non - compact ( metric ) spaces @xcite .",
    "the concept of entropy is useful for studying topological and measure - theoretic structures of dynamical systems .",
    "for instance , two conjugated systems have a same entropy and thus entropy is a numerical invariant of the class of conjugated dynamical systems .",
    "the theory of expansive dynamical systems has been closely related to the theory of topological entropy @xcite .",
    "entropy and chaos are closely related , e.g. , a continuous mapping @xmath13 is chaotic if and only if it has a positive topological entropy @xcite .",
    "a remarkable result is that a deterministic system together with an invariant probability measure defines a random process . as a consequence ,",
    "a deterministic system can generate dynamical randomness , which is characterized by an entropy per unit time that measures the disorder of the trajectories along the time axis .",
    "entropy has many applications , e.g. , transport properties in escape - rate theory @xcite , where an escape of trajectories is introduced by absorbing conditions at the boundaries of a system .",
    "these absorbing boundary conditions select a set of phase - space trajectories , forming a chaotic and fractal repeller , which is related to an equation for k - s entropy .",
    "the escape - rate formalism has applications in diffusion @xcite , to reaction - diffusion @xcite , and recently to viscosity @xcite .",
    "another application is the classification of quantum dynamical systems , which is given by ohya @xcite .",
    "symbolic dynamical systems @xmath14 have various representative and complicated dynamical properties and characteristics , with an entropy @xmath15 .",
    "when determining whether or not a given topological dynamical system has certain dynamical complexity , it is often compared with a symbolic dynamical system @xcite .",
    "for the topological conjugation with symbolic dynamical systems , we refer to ornstein @xcite , sinai @xcite , akashi @xcite , and wang and wei @xcite .",
    "the main purpose is to introduce a topological entropy for perfect mappings defined on arbitrary hausdorff spaces ( compactness and metrizability not necessarily required ) , and investigate fundamental properties of such an entropy .    instead of using all open covers of the space to define entropy",
    ", we consider the open covers consisting of the co - compact open sets ( open sets whose complements are compact ) .",
    "various definitions of entropy and historical notes are mentioned previously in this section .",
    "section 2 investigates the topological properties of co - compact open covers of a space .",
    "section 3 introduces the new topological entropy defined through co - compact covers of the space , which is called co - compact entropy in the paper .",
    "section 4 further explores the properties of the co - compact entropy and compares it with adler , konheim and mcandrew s topological entropy for compact spaces .",
    "sections 5 and 6 investigate the relation between the co - compact entropy and bowen s entropy .",
    "more precisely , section 5 compares the co - compact entropy with that given by bowen for systems defined on metric spaces .",
    "because the spaces under consideration include non - compact metric spaces , the traditional lebesgue covering theorem does not apply .",
    "thus , one work is to generalize this theorem to co - compact open covers of non - compact metric spaces .",
    "based on the generalized lebesgue covering theorem , we show that the co - compact entropy is a lower bound for bowen s entropies . in section 6 , a linear dynamical system is studied . for this simple system , its co - compact",

    "the investigation of dynamical systems could be tracked back to isaac newton s era when calculus and his laws of motion and universal gravitation were invented or discovered , in which differential equations with time as a parameter play a dominant role .",
    "however , it was not realized until the end of the 19th century that the hope of solving all kinds of problems in celestial mechanics by following newton s frame and methodology , e.g. , the two body problem , becomes unrealistic when jules henri poincar s new methods of celestial mechanics was publicized ( shortly after this , in the early 20th century , fundamental changes in electrodynamics occurred when albert einstein s historical papers appeared : reconciling newtonian mechanics with maxwell s electrodynamics , separating newtonian mechanics from quantum mechanics , and extending the principle of relativity to non - uniform motion ) , in which the space of all potential values of the parameters of the system is included in the analysis , and the attention to the system was changed from individual solutions to dynamical properties of all solutions as well as the relation among all solutions .",
    "although this approach may not provide much information on individual solutions , it can obtain important information of most of the solutions .",
    "for example , by taking an approach similar to that in ergodic theory , poincar concluded that for all hamiltonian systems , most solutions are stable @xcite .",
    "the study of dynamical systems has become a central part of mathematics and its applications since the middle of the 20th century when scientists from all related disciplines realized the power and beauty of the geometric and qualitative techniques developed during this period for nonlinear systems ( see e.g. , robinson @xcite ) .",

    "kolmogorov s metric entropy as an invariant of measure theoretical dynamical systems is a powerful concept because it controls the top of the hierarchy of ergodic properties , and plays a remarkable role in investigating the complexity and other properties of the systems . as an analogous invariant under conjugation of topological dynamical systems ,",
    "topological entropy plays prominent role for the study of dynamical systems , and is often used as a measure in determining dynamical behavior ( e.g. , chaos ) and complexity of systems . in particular , topological entropy bounds measure - theoretic entropy ( goodwyn @xcite ) .",
    "other relations between various entropy characterizations were extensively studied , e.g. , dinaburg @xcite .",

    "this new entropy retains various fundamental properties of adler , konheim and mcandrew s entropy ( e.g. , invariant under conjugation , entropy of a subsystem does not exceed that of the whole system ) .",
    "another noticeable property of the co - compact entropy is that it is metric - independent for dynamical systems defined on metric spaces , thus different from the entropy defined by bowen . in particular , for the linear mapping given in section [ sec5 ] ( locally compact system ) , its co - compact entropy is @xmath16 , which would be at least @xmath2 according to bowen s definition ; as a positive entropy usually reflects certain dynamical complexity of a system , this new entropy is more appropriate .    for a dynamical system defined on a metric space , bowen s definition may result in different entropies when",
