    "the coma supercluster is the nearest rich supercluster of galaxies @xcite , consisting of two rich abell clusters , separated by @xmath11  mpc , but connected by a prominent filament of galaxies and poorer groups @xcite , which is part of the supercluster identified as the `` great wall '' in the first major redshift survey of galaxies in the nearby universe @xcite . at a distance of @xmath12  mpc",
    ", it affords a closer look at the properties of individual galaxies ( 1  kpc@xmath132.1 arcsec ) , but its large angular scale on the sky presents observational challenges for the narrow fields of view of most instruments .",
    "it is interesting to note that even though they are the two most significant structures in the supercluster , the two abell clusters are remarkably different in every respect .",
    "the optical luminosity function of galaxies in the coma cluster , for instance , has a much steeper faint - end slope than that of its neighbour abell  1367 @xcite .",
    "early studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) revealed that the fraction of spiral galaxies in the coma cluster is anomalously low compared to abell  1367 .",
    "in addition , galaxies in the core of the coma cluster were identified to be unusually deficient in neutral hydrogen ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , ionized hydrogen @xcite and molecular gas ( h@xmath14/co ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a strong hi gradient in coma galaxies- many of the inner , hi poor spirals being quite blue , suggesting that some gas removal process has acted quite recently , while abell  1367 was found to be a mixture of hi poor and rich galaxies .",
    "the availability of more detailed analyses of star formation , based on multi - wavelength data , and of spectral indices sensitive to stellar ages , has made this field more interesting .",
    "estimates of star formation activity from mid - infrared ( ir ) @xcite and galaxy evolution explorer ( _ galex _ ) ultraviolet @xcite photometry show that star formation in coma on the whole is substantially suppressed compared to that in the field , while abell  1367 has an abundance of bright star - forming galaxies @xcite .    in a hierarchical model of the formation of structures in the universe , it is not surprising that a rich cluster , with a relaxed appearance in its x - ray image , such as coma , would represent the end product of the gradual assimilation of several galaxy groups over time . in spite of the claim of @xcite that the coma cluster does not have significant substructure , it has subsequently been shown to have at least three major subclusters in the optical @xcite and x - ray maps @xcite . at the other end of the supercluster , abell  1367",
    "is also found to be elongated with three major subclusters , along the axis of the filament , with a population of star - forming galaxies infalling into the se cloud and possibly the other two as well @xcite .",
    "this has prompted a multitude of studies attempting to link the dynamical history of the supercluster with the properties of individual galaxies to investigate both the process of building clusters , as well as the effect of large - scale structure on the star formation history of galaxies @xcite .    by employing the spectral analysis of galaxies in coma , together with the x - ray map of @xcite",
    ", @xcite found that the post - starburst ( k+a ) galaxies , in which star formation has been quenched within the last 1 - 1.5 gyr , are associated with the x - ray excess attributed to the substructure in coma .",
    "however , this work was limited to 3 fields in the @xmath15  mpc region surrounding the centre of coma .",
    "in addition to star formation indices measured from optical spectra , the availability of _ spitzer _ mips mid - ir observations has been recently utilised by several authors to characterise the star formation properties of the obscured component in galaxies in clusters and groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the abell 1367 24  dataset consists of a single mosaic obtained in medium scan mode , with scan leg spacing equal to the full array width , producing an effective exposure time per pixel of 40sec .",
    "the sextractor package @xcite was used to automatically detect sources , and obtain photometric parameters .",
    "the images were first background - subtracted , and then filtered with gaussian functions , with full width half maximum ( fwhm ) matching the 24  point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "aperture photometry was obtained for all objects having 8 contiguous pixels above the 1@xmath3 rms background noise level .",

    "leaves the object unresolved at 24 , and hence we estimate the total 24  flux of these objects from the flux contained within the 21@xmath30 aperture , corrected by a factor 1.29",
    ".    however , at the redshift of the coma and abell 1367 clusters , many of the brighter galaxies ( spirals in particular ) are larger than our nominal 21@xmath30 diameter aperture , such that a significant fraction of their 24  flux is missed . for these galaxies , we use instead one of the larger apertures , matched to contain the optical flux as parametrized by r@xmath31 ( the radius which contains 90% of the @xmath32band flux ) as measured from the sdss image . finally , for some of the bright cluster galaxies ( 9 in total ) , the value of r@xmath31 is under - estimated . to correct for this , sm eyeballed the 24  images of these objects , and estimated an appropriate radius , in each case , for extracting the ` total ' 24 flux . in the case of the brighter spiral galaxies in coma and abell 1367 ,",
    "the 24  emission often shows significant structure due to spiral arms and star - forming regions , necessitating a high value of the deblending parameter , to prevent the galaxy being shredded by sextractor .",
    "particular care was required to correctly deblend the face - on spiral ngc3861 from ngc3861b , while keeping ngc3861 intact .",
    "we note that for @xmath3350% of our sample the typical measurement error in the 24  flux is @xmath34 mjy ( which is @xmath35 of the measured flux ) , and for @xmath36 the error is @xmath37 mjy . in total ,",
    "@xmath3390% of our galaxies have 24 flux measured with @xmath38 uncertainty .      to match the sdss spectroscopic catalogue for the coma supercluster with the mir 24  data , we choose the nearest optical counterpart within 5@xmath30 of each 24  source .",
    "this accounts for a displacement of no more than 2.5  @xmath39 kpc between the centres .",
    "we note that @xmath4080% of the matches are found to have centres within 2@xmath30 of each other .",
    "16 of our sources above the detection threshold were found to have multiple matches within the matching radius of 5@xmath30 .",
    "our final dataset comprises of 3,787 galaxies ( @xmath41 ) with spectroscopic redshifts from sdss , and radial velocity within @xmath422,000 km  s@xmath19 of coma or abell 1367 , in the @xmath33500 square degree region of the sky covered by the coma supercluster . out of these , 197 within @xmath332 @xmath39  mpc of the centre of coma and 24 within @xmath330.65 @xmath39  mpc of the centre of abell 1367",

    "the probability that a background mips source lies within the matching radius of 5@xmath30 by chance , depends only on the density of the 24  sources . for the completeness limit ( 0.33 mjy )",
    "adopted here , this density is @xmath43deg@xmath44 ( see fig . 3 of * ?",
    "this gives the required probability as 0.018 , implying that our sample of 197 24  detected galaxies in coma may have 34 interlopers .",

    "located @xmath33100  mpc from us , the coma supercluster offers a unique opportunity for investigating the effect on individual galaxies of the hierarchical formation of structures in the universe , as galaxies progress through various environments towards the cores of the clusters .    in order to give a general overview of the optical star formation properties of galaxies along the entire supercluster , in fig .",
    "[ scl ] we plot the positions of all the galaxies from the sdss spectroscopic catalogue found in our redshift range , and the major galaxy groups obtained from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned , http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/ ) . in order to avoid multiple detections",

    "the positions of agn host galaxies , identified using the bpt diagram ( * ? ? ?",

    "we also show the limited regions at the cores of the coma and abell 1367 clusters , over which the 24  data are available , and utilised in this paper . plotted in the bottom panel of the same figure , is the distribution of the agn and starburst galaxies , as fractions of the 150 galaxies contributing to each bin .",
    "it is worth mentioning that although these distributions are a fair representation of the data , the binning has resulted in a spurious feature at the position of abell 1367 .",
    "as is already well known in the literature , the central region of abell 1367 is sparsely populated , the majority of galaxies in the core being late - type . in this figure",
    ", it appears that the fraction of starburst galaxies does not decline in the core of abell 1367 , but if the data is re - binned so as to have equally - spaced bins , this would not be the case .",
    "having said that , the decline in the fraction of starburst galaxies at the centre of abell  1367 is much shallower than that seen in coma .",
    "in general , the optically - identified agn seem to be more or less uniformly distributed throughout the supercluster ( figs .",
    "[ scl ] and [ agn_frac ] ) , except for a sharp decline in the cores of both the clusters .",
    "this latter result is counter - intuitive , because agn hosts are known to be early - type massive galaxies which mostly reside in dense environments .",
    "hence , this may indicate that the optical emission from the agn present in this region is obscured and/or detectable at other wavelengths ( radio / x - ray ) .",
    "the latter is beyond the scope of this work , but our mips 24  data supports the former possibility . as seen in fig .",
    "[ radius ] , not only does the relative fraction of the red 24  galaxies marginally increase towards the centre , around 50% of them are found within 0.5  @xmath39  mpc of the centre of the coma cluster , indicating that optical emission from several agn hosts may be obscured .",
    "further evidence in support of this argument may be drawn from fig .",
    "[ bpt ] where a large fraction of galaxies detected at 24  do not show [ oiii ] and/or h@xmath48 in emission , but their h@xmath46/[nii ] flux ratios are consistent with the presence of an agn @xcite on the bpt diagram @xcite .",
    "we further investigate the environmental trends for agn and star formation activity within the coma supercluster , by estimating the local fraction of star - forming galaxies ( @xmath1 ) and agn ( @xmath49 ) over the entire supercluster , both for massive galaxies ( @xmath50 ; @xmath51 , assuming @xmath52 from * ? ? ? * ) and the dwarf galaxy population ( @xmath53 ; @xmath54 ) .",
    "following @xcite , we define the local projected density of galaxies ( @xmath55 ) using a variant of the adaptive kernel estimator @xcite , where each galaxy @xmath56 is represented by an adaptive gaussian kernel @xmath57 .",
    "this is different from the algorithm of @xcite , which , in its previous applications to astronomical data , requires the kernel width @xmath58 to be iteratively set to be proportional to @xmath59 . in this work ,",
    "we fix the transverse width @xmath58 to be proportional to @xmath60 , where @xmath60 is the distance to the third nearest neighbour within 500kms@xmath19 .",
    "the dominant factors governing the star formation properties of a galaxy are the mass of its dm halo , and whether it is the central or a satellite galaxy in a halo @xcite .",
    "we adopt the above method , and choose the dimensions of the kernel , keeping this in mind . in the case of galaxies within groups or clusters ,",
    "the local environment is measured on the scale of their host halo ( 0.11 mpc ) , while for galaxies in field regions the local density is estimated by smoothing over their 510 nearest neighbours or on scales of 15mpc ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "we can then map the local galaxy density ( @xmath61 ) and @xmath5-band luminosity density ( @xmath62 ) as and , where @xmath63 is the @xmath5-band luminosity of galaxy @xmath56 ( see fig .",

    "we do not consider the lower mass galaxies , as the fraction of agn declines rapidly to zero below @xmath66 ;    for comparison , fig .",

    "[ agn_frac ] we see that the agn fraction @xmath49 , among massive galaxies ( @xmath50 ) declines at the centre of the coma and abell 1367 clusters , while elsewhere , it is uniformly distributed .",
    "this appears to contradict the results of @xcite , who found the agn fraction to be independent of environment , and to be a monotonically increasing function of stellar mass .",
    "however , the volume studied by @xcite within sdss dr4 did not cover clusters as rich as coma or abell 1367 .",
    "this may indicate that only the very dense environments affect the optical agn activity of galaxies .",
    "the relation between @xmath49 and local environment is unclear in the intermediate density group environment .",
    "while the @xmath49 values decline in the centre of some groups , in others they exceed the mean value for the field . although there is a slight indication that the groups in which the @xmath49 appears to be declining , mostly lie on the filament connecting the coma and abell 1367 , or in the vicinity of the clusters themselves , while the groups with higher values of @xmath49 lie in underdense regions .",
    "however , it is not possible to draw any firm statistical inferences from this observation .    whether the agn fraction @xmath49 varies with environment or not depends on how the activity of the galactic nuclei is defined",
    "@xcite do not find any correlation between galaxy density and f@xmath71 in a large sample of galaxies ( @xmath72 ) , where the agn are defined in terms of optical emission line ratios characterised by the bpt diagram .",
    "other studies find higher incidence of optical agn in groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "if the agn were selected according to their radio , mid - ir or x - ray properties , they would be found in differen hosts : radio agn in early - type galaxies , ir agn in bluer galaxies , and x - ray agn in galaxies of intermediate colour @xcite .",
    "the environment dependence of agn activity is thus largely linked to the distribution of the hosts .",
    "the incidence of x - ray agn is higher in galaxy groups than in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the fraction of radio - loud agn is the same in the brightest galaxies of groups and clusters and in the field , but higher in non - central galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the mass function of black holes is independent of environment , and the variation in the distribution of optical , radio and x - ray agn can be understood in terms of the accretion processes that lead to the manifestation of the agn in the various ranges of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "we measured the significance of the spatial variations seen in @xmath49 across the supercluster by performing monte carlo simulations , in which we made repeated maps of @xmath49 after randomly assigning the positions of the agn to the bright galaxies (  testing the null hypothesis that @xmath49 is constant across the supercluster ) , and measuring the fraction of maps in which a given local value of @xmath49 was obtained within one of the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the results of these simulations are represented by the white contours , which indicate regions that have @xmath73 1 and 2-@xmath3 below the mean value across the supercluster .",
    "this confirms that the decline in @xmath49 seen towards the core of the coma cluster is significant at the 3@xmath3 level , while that seen in abell 1367 is significant at the 2@xmath3 level .    in fig .",
    "[ sf_frac ] we show the general correlation between the fraction of star - forming galaxies ( @xmath1 ) and environment for massive galaxies ( @xmath50 ; top panel ) and the dwarf galaxies ( @xmath74 ; bottom panel ) . for the massive galaxies we find an almost uniform @xmath75 in all the environments . for dwarf galaxies ,",
    "we see a much stronger sf - density relation , with @xmath1 rising rapidly from the @xmath76.10.4 seen in the cluster cores , to @xmath77 in the field .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the origin of the sf - density relation for the dwarf galaxies can be attributed to the fact that ( i ) the star formation in dwarf galaxies can easily be quenched by the tidal impact of a massive neighbour and/or the icm of the cluster @xcite , and ( ii ) unlike their massive counterparts , dwarfs ( of the luminosities considered here ) do not become passive by internal mechanisms such as gas consumption through star formation , merging etc .. however , the effects of supernovae wind blowouts and feedback become significant for relatively faint ( @xmath78 m@xmath79 ) dwarfs @xcite . in this work",
    "we do not find any evidence for the quenching of star formation in galaxies on the filament(s ) , but only in the cores of the embedded galaxy groups .",
    "the h@xmath46 emission traces the current sfr of a galaxy , while the continuum flux under this line can be used as an indicator of its past sfr , making the globally averaged ew(h@xmath46 ) from a galaxy an effective indicator of the birthrate parameter ( @xmath80 current sfr normalized by the sfr averaged over the lifetime of a galaxy ) .",

    "the k+a galaxies preferentially avoid the dense centre of the cluster . *",
    "the spatial distribution of the k+a galaxies suggests a correlation between the substructure of the coma cluster ( revealed in the x - ray emission ) and the mechanisms responsible for quenching star formation in galaxies .",

    "<S> we analyse spitzer mips 24@xmath0 m observations , and sloan digital sky survey ( dr7 ) optical broadband photometry and spectra , to investigate the star formation properties of galaxies residing in the coma supercluster region . </S>",
    "<S> we find that star formation ( sf ) in dwarf galaxies is quenched only in the high density environment at the centre of clusters and groups , but that passively - evolving massive galaxies are found in all environments , indicating that massive galaxies can become passive via internal processes . </S>",
    "<S> the sf - density relation observed for the massive galaxies is weaker relative to the dwarfs , but both show a trend for the fraction of star - forming galaxies ( @xmath1 ) declining to @xmath2 in the cluster cores . </S>",
    "<S> we find agn activity is also suppressed among massive galaxies residing in the cluster cores .    </S>",
    "<S> we present evidence for a strong dependence of the mechanism(s ) responsible for quenching star formation in dwarf galaxies on the cluster potential , resulting in two distinct evolutionary pathways . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we find a significant increase ( at the 3@xmath3 level ) in the mean equivalent width of h@xmath4 emission among star - forming dwarf galaxies in the infall regions of the coma cluster and the core of abell 1367 with respect to the overall supercluster population , indicative of the infalling dwarf galaxies undergoing a starburst phase . </S>",
    "<S> we identify these starburst galaxies as the precursors of the post - starburst k+a galaxies . extending the survey of k+a galaxies over the whole supercluster region , we find 11.4% of all dwarf ( @xmath5 mag @xmath6 ) galaxies in the coma cluster and 4.8% in the abell  1367 have post - starburst like spectra , while this fraction is just 2.1% when averaged over the entire supercluster region ( excluding the clusters ) . </S>",
    "<S> this points to a cluster - specific evolutionary process in which infalling dwarf galaxies undergo a starburst and subsequent rapid quenching due to their passage through the dense icm . in galaxy groups , </S>",
    "<S> the star formation in infalling dwarf galaxies is instead slowly quenched due to the reduced efficiency of ram - pressure stripping .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the central @xmath7  mpc of the coma cluster , the ( @xmath8 ) near / mid infra - red colour of galaxies is correlated with their optical @xmath9 colour and h@xmath4 emission , separating all mid - infrared ( mir ) detected galaxies into two distinct classes of ` red ' and ` blue ' . by analysing the spatial and velocity distribution of galaxies detected at 24  in coma </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the ( optically ) red 24  detected galaxies follow the general distribution of ` all ' the spectroscopic members , but their ( optically ) blue counterparts ( i ) are almost completely absent in the central @xmath10  mpc of coma , and ( ii ) have a remarkable peak in their velocity distribution , corresponding to the mean radial velocity of the galaxy group ngc4839 , suggesting that a significant fraction of the ` blue ' mir galaxies are currently on their first infall towards the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of adopting different sfr tracers for quantifying evolutionary trends like the butcher - oemler effect are also discussed .    </S>",
