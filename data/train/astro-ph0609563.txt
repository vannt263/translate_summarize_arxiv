    "recent observations indicate that there are not enough cooling flows in galaxy clusters to explain why hot gas in some clusters are so hot @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , neutrino oscillation experiments ( solar , atmospheric and lsnd experiments ) indicate that 3 ordinary neutrinos can not explain the three different scales of the mass squared differences between neutrino species @xmath1 s , of about @xmath2 ev@xmath3 , @xmath4 ev@xmath3 and 1 ev@xmath3 @xcite , suggesting that one or more sterile neutrinos must be added . in this article , we study the possibility that a species of massive sterile neutrinos ( @xmath0 kev ) exists and their decays provide a heating source to maintain the temperature of the hot gas .",
    "we use this model to predict a relation among the luminosity , total mass and redshift of a cluster , and we obtain an estimate of the decayrate of the sterile neutrinos by using available data from 12 clusters .",
    "this idea of the radiative decay of neutrinos as an energy source has been proposed to account for reionization @xcite .",
    "in standard cosmology , neutrinos with @xmath5 mev are classified as hot dark matter ( hdm ) because they are relativistic at decoupling .",
    "as the universe expands , they cool down and become non - relativistic after a redshift of @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the neutrino temperature today . in the non - relativistic regime ,",
    "the average neutrino speed at neutrino temperature @xmath8 is @xcite @xmath9 they do not contribute to structure formation if their average speed is too high .",
    "for example , at matter - radiation equality ( redshift @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the hubble parameter ) , the neutrino speed is close to @xmath12 if @xmath13 ev . by using perturbation theory on neutrino clustering ,",
    "it was found that massive neutrinos can gravitationally cluster if @xmath14 is greater than several ev s @xcite .",
    "therefore , neutrinos with mass @xmath1510 ev can be classified as warm dark matter ( wdm ) rather than hdm .",
    "in this model , we assume that all 3 types of active neutrinos with masses @xmath16 and @xmath17 did not contribute to structure formation and are thus classified as hdm @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the light neutrino density parameter .",
    "in addition , we assume that all cold dark matter are composed of two types of sterile neutrinos with masses @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and the latter will decay into @xmath22 neutrinos with decay rate @xmath23 : @xmath24    the massive sterile neutrinos may be produced in the early universe by oscillations from active neutrinos @xcite . from the standard cosmology , the number densities of sterile neutrinos @xmath25 and @xmath26 at present ( time = @xmath27 )",
    "are upper bounded by @xcite @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constants which are dependent on the cosmological sterile neutrino density parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively , and @xmath34 is the number density of one type of the active neutrinos now ( @xmath35 @xmath36 if there were no sterile neutrino decays @xcite ) . if the sterile neutrinos can decay to @xmath22 neutrinos emitting a photon with energy @xmath37 , the number density of the @xmath22 neutrinos now is given by @xmath38.\\ ] ] therefore , we can write the cold dark matter density parameter @xmath39 as @xmath40    the interaction of the radiated photons and electrons in the cluster hot gas can be treated as a heating source of the hot gas .",
    "there exists a lower limit of the energy of the photons such that they can undergo compton scattering with electrons rather than inverse compton scattering ( see appendix ) .",
    "the energy of photons must be greater than the energy of the electrons in order to transfer energy to the hot gas , which typically has temperature of about several kev s in clusters .",
    "therefore , in our model , @xmath21 must be at least of kev order . here , we set @xmath41 , as neutrino oscillation experiments indicate that the difference in the mass squared of three active neutrino species , @xmath1 s , are about @xmath2 ev and @xmath4 ev @xcite .",
    "( 8) gives one relation between two unknowns , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "another relation comes from the decay of @xmath21 neutrinos , which we assume to be the source of hot gas luminosity .",
    "the total non - baryonic mass in a cluster is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the total masses of three types of active neutrinos and two types of sterile neutrinos respectively . by combining eqs .",
    "( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) , we get @xmath50,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the total number of sterile neutrinos inside a cluster , and @xmath52 . the total power given out by the radiative neutrinos in a cluster at time",
    "@xmath53 is @xmath54 .",
    "therefore we get @xmath55.\\ ] ]    at the time of cmb last scattering ( @xmath56 s ) , the cold dark matter density @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the scale factor of the universe at @xmath60 . in order to heat up the hot gas",
    ", the value of @xmath23 must be greater than @xmath61 s@xmath62 by using eq .  (",
    "11 ) ( also see fig .  1 )",
    ". therefore the factor @xmath63 and @xmath64 . at the time of galaxy formation ( @xmath65 s ) , the dark matter density @xmath66 is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the scale factor of the universe at @xmath69 .",
    "the factor @xmath70 is much less than 1 , and we get @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , at @xmath69 , @xmath20 neutrinos dominate all the dark matter .",
    "we can therefore obtain another relation between @xmath42 and @xmath43 by taking the difference of eq .",
    "( 12 ) and eq .  ( 13 ) .",
    "so the density of @xmath21 neutrinos @xmath72 at @xmath60 is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the critical density of the universe , @xmath75 is from wmap data and @xmath76 is 2dfgrs data corresponding to cmb last scattering and galaxy formation respectively @xcite .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath77 ev = @xmath78 ev , which means that @xmath20 must be greater than 12 ev and consistent with our assumption that they can form structures .",
    "the upper bound of @xmath43 obtained by eq .",
    "( 14 ) is about 3 ev .    by using these values",
    ", we can find the value of @xmath23 as well as the corresponding mass components in cluster .",
    "since @xmath42 is much greater than @xmath22 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we can rewrite eq .  (",
    "11 ) as @xmath81,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the redshift of a cluster and we have assumed matter dominated expansion and @xmath83 is much greater than 1 . by using data of redshifts , luminosities and masses from 12 clusters ( see table 1 ) , we can estimate @xmath23 from the slope of @xmath84 vs.  @xmath85 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the slope and y - intercept obtained are @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which imply @xmath88 s@xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding mass components in clusters with @xmath89 or @xmath90 are given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the density parameter of neutrinos with @xmath93 .",
    "for a typical cluster with @xmath94 , the present value of @xmath49 is about @xmath95 .",
    "we can predict the temperature profile of the hot gas in a cluster by using a simple energy flow equation .",
    "we first look at the mechanism of how the energy from neutrinos decays is transferred to the hot gas .",
    "since the @xmath21 neutrinos have mass greater than kev , they must have gravitationally collapsed to galactic scale structures @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the radius of a hydrostatic ` neutrino star ' is given by @xcite @xmath96 from our estimate , @xmath49 and @xmath21 are of order @xmath97 solar mass and kev respectively .",
    "therefore , the size of a corresponding ` sterile neutrino star ' is about 20 pc which may hide deeply inside the galactic bulge .",
    "suppose a photon travels from @xmath98 and collides with electrons in a cluster .",
    "the number of collisions of a photon and electrons within a radius @xmath99 is approximately given by the optical depth : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the mean free path of a photon , and @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the electron number density and compton cross section respectively . in a cluster , the electron number density is given by @xmath104^{3 \\beta_c/2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are parameters in the cluster beta model @xcite . in fig .  2",
    ", we plot the number of collisions @xmath108 vs.  @xmath99 .",
    "we can see that @xmath108 is much less than 1 for all @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , a photon does not collide frequently with electrons in a cluster .",
    "however , inside the milkyway galactic bulge , the number density of electrons is @xmath109^{1.8}},\\ ] ] where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are parameters which are equal to @xmath112 @xmath36 and 0.34 pc respectively @xcite .",
    "3 shows the number of collisions inside the galactic bulge .",
    "we can see that @xmath108 is much greater than 1 for small @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , we can believe that the energy of the photons are first absorbed by the electrons inside the galactic bulge and then the energy is transferred to the hot gas by conduction inside the cluster .",
    "the mean free path for conduction is @xcite @xmath113 which is smaller than the length scale of a cluster ( @xmath114 1 mpc ) with the temperature of hot gas @xmath115 k. the energy flux per unit time for conduction is given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 we can obtain the temperature profile @xmath118 by solving eq .",
    "( 22 ) with @xmath119 and @xmath120 if we know the energy source distribution @xmath121 in a cluster , which is approximately proportional to the sterile neutrino distribution .",
    "we demonstrate possible temperature profiles by using two models . in one",
    "we assume that the power sources are located at the centre of a cluster with @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the total luminosity of the cluster . in the other one ,",
    "we assume that the power sources are distributed as @xmath124 , where @xmath125 can be fixed by the total luminosity @xmath123 .",
    "4 shows the temperature profiles of the two models .",
    "we can see that the temperature varies only within 6 percents of the central temperature @xmath126 , which is due to the large value of @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , the energy is transferred from the sources ( decayed @xmath21 neutrinos ) to the hot gas quite efficiently within the hubble time .",
    "it has been a puzzle why some clusters are still so hot even though their cooling times are shorter than the hubble time . even though cooling flow models @xcite can help to explain this phenomenon , significant cooling flow in clusters has not been observed .",
    "this is known as the ` mass sink problem ' @xcite .",
    "also , the cooling flow model predicts that the temperature of the hot gas should be quite inhomogeneous .",
    "however , the observed hot gas temperature profiles are quite homogeneous and gas with temperature less than 1 kev does not exist in the amount predicted .",
    "donahue and voit summarized the drawbacks of the cooling flow models and suggested that any successful model must explain the mass sink problem and the homogeneous temperature profile with positive core temperature gradients extending to @xmath128 kpc @xcite .",
    "here , we present an alternative solution of the mass sink problem . we have discussed how the radiative decay of sterile neutrinos can heat up the hot gas in clusters .",
    "our model predicts a redshift dependence of @xmath129 , eq .",
    "( 15 ) , which is consistent with the observed data ( see fig .  1 ) , and we obtain the decay rate of the sterile neutrinos in clusters , which is about @xmath130 s@xmath62 .",
    "our picture does not require any cooling flow , and the radiative heating power by neutrino decays results in a quite homogeneous temperature profile .",
    "therefore , our model can fit the observed information and solve the cooling flow problem for a range of @xmath23 .",
    "if we can constrain the values of @xmath22 and @xmath42 @xcite , we can get a better picture and fix @xmath23 . the radius of a @xmath131 solar mass @xmath20 neutrino star is of order 10 kpc which is the same scale as a galaxy .",
    "therefore we propose that the galactic dark matter may be composed of @xmath20 and @xmath21 sterile neutrinos .",
    "by examining the rotation curve of a galaxy , we can obtain a feasible range of @xmath20 . if @xmath22 is below 1 ev , the size of an @xmath22 neutrino star is greater than 1 mpc , which is the cluster scale",
    ". therefore , the active neutrinos may affect the properties of hot gas and clusters @xcite .",
    "different neutrinos may correspond to structures in different scales .",
    "it would be interesting to study whether our model can solve both the dark matter problem and the cooling flow problem .",
    "we calculate how the compton scattering of photons and electrons can heat up the hot gas in clusters . in the usual compton scattering calculation ,",
    "the electron is at rest .",
    "however , the temperature of the hot gas in most clusters are at @xmath132 k , and so we should generalize the situation by transforming to the electron s rest frame @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath133 @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the initial energy of the photon in the lab frame and electron s rest frame respectively , and @xmath137 is the angle between the initial photon direction and electron velocity in the lab frame . the subscript ` s ' indicates the scattered energy or angle .",
    "the scattered power in the rest frame is given by @xmath138 where @xmath103 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the compton cross section , distribution function and momentum of photons respectively .",
    "since the distribution of the photons is not necessarily isotropic , we need to transform back to the lab frame and integrate over all @xmath141 . making use of @xmath142 , and combining eqs .",
    "( 25 ) and ( 26 ) , we have @xmath143 after summing up all the momenta of the photon , we have @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the scattered energy density of the photons in the lab frame . since @xmath146 and @xmath147 , we have @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the scattered power in the lab frame . in the lab frame ,",
    "the rate of energy removed from the photon field is @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the energy density of the photons in the lab frame .",
    "therefore , the net energy radiated is the difference of energy scattered and energy removed in lab frame : @xmath152 if all the photons undergo thomson scattering with electrons , then @xmath153 in eq .  ( 30 ) and @xmath151 will be the same as @xmath145 . however , in general , @xmath136 may not be equal to @xmath154 .",
    "suppose we have only a particular energy for the photon field , @xmath155 .",
    "from eq .",
    "( 30 ) , we have @xmath156,\\ ] ] where @xmath157 .",
    "after simplification , eq .",
    "( 31 ) will become @xmath158.\\ ] ] from eqs .",
    "( 24 ) and ( 25 ) , we have @xmath159 therefore ,",
    "the net power radiated in the lab frame is @xmath160.\\ ] ] if the net power radiated is a positive value , that means there is some energy removed from the electron gas and thus the energy of photon field is increased .",
    "this is known as inverse compton scattering .",
    "however , it is possible that the value of the net power radiated is negative , which means that the electrons absorb energy from the photon field .",
    "if the photon and electron compton scatter in the rest frame of the electron , then we have @xmath161 we integrate over all the angles to get the averaged energy gain in one scattering : @xmath162 combining eqs .",
    "( 32 ) , ( 33 ) and ( 36 ) , we get @xmath163.\\ ] ] therefore , the criterion for energy absorption from the photon field is @xmath164 since @xmath165 , we can write @xmath166 in terms of @xmath167 . for non - relativistic electron , @xmath168 , @xmath169 .",
    "so , if the photon energy is greater than the kinetic energy of the electron , the electron will gain energy and vice versa .",
