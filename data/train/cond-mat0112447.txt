    "almost twenty years passed from the discovery of high-@xmath3 superconductivity ( htsc ) but for now there is no widely accepted theory of pairing mechanism in cuprates of p- and n - type .",
    "the necessary ingredient for discussing possible mechanisms of htsc is the band structure of the fermion - like quasiparticles .",
    "however , it is a difficult subject for ab initio calculations due to the strong electron correlations . for this reason we will use a model approach and in order to get an agreement with experimental data we will start with a realistic multiband p - d model of transition metal oxides .",
    "the hubbard model is often used to study electronic structure of strongly correlated electron systems ( sces ) . to take into account the chemistry of metal oxides",
    "the hubbard model is generalized to the p - d model , a simplest version of such a model has been proposed by emery @xcite and varma et al . @xcite . in this 3-band p - d model only @xmath1 cu and @xmath4 o orbitals are considered .",
    "one of the important features omitted in this model is asymmetry of n - type ( electrons doped ) and p - type ( holes doped ) cuprates .",
    "point is that the spin - exciton concerned with singlet - triplet excitation of two - hole term occurs only in p - type systems , but not in n - type @xcite .",
    "other feature is a non - zero occupancy of @xmath5 cu orbitals @xcite .",
    "there also a dependence between @xmath3 and occupancy of @xmath5 was found .",

    "previously the motion of triplet holes and the simplest version of singlet - triplet model have been studied in @xcite .",
    "but these authors used the 3-band p - d model @xcite where the difference between energy of singlet and energy of triplet @xmath89 is about 2 ev .",

    "it is this small value of singlet - triplet splitting that let us believe that singlet - triplet excitations has a non - negligible contribution to band structure and also can give new superconducting pairing channel .    as easily can be noted the resulting hamiltonian ( [ eq5 ] )",
    "is the generalization of t - j model to account of two - particle triplet state .",

    "condition ( [ eq22 ] ) is satisfied only in case of p- and d - pairing but not for symmetric s - pairing .",
    "hence in the singlet - triplet model the symmetric s - type singlet pairing is absent .",

    "obviously triplet channel gives the additional pairing .",
    "it is very interesting that @xmath2-type includes exchange integrals only for next - nearest neighbors ( see equation ( [ eq29 ] ) ) and therefore can exist only in second coordination sphere .",
    "hence in nearest neighbor approximation we can have only order parameter of @xmath1-symmetry .",
    "actually equations ( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq28 ] ) are equations for order parameters @xmath197 and @xmath198 respectively and should be solved self - consistently via green function equations ( [ eq21 ] ) .",
    "when this is done we can obtain energy spectrum and phase diagram @xmath3 versus concentration @xmath199 .",
    "the other symmetry types are not realized due to absence of corresponding combinations of trigonometrical functions in expression for superconducting gap ( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "combination of previously analyzed types such as s+d is impossible because in the considered case of tetragonal lattice symmetry s- and d- types belongs to different irreducible representation ( see review @xcite and references from there ) . so the order parameter symmetry must be of d - type or , more precisely , to be a concurrence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 singlet pairing types .",
    "this conclusion is true not only for hole doped systems but also for electron doped systems because in the limit of infinite energy of singlet - triplet excitation ( i.e. absence of excitations to the triplet states - this case corresponds to n - type cuprates ) our equations take the form of t - j model ones and the gap symmetry remains .",

    "distance between van - hove singularity and fermi level is 0.074 ev , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    it can be seen that singlet sub - band is very wide - almost 3 ev .",
    "it is a consequence of hubbard i approximation in spectrum renormalization term @xmath137 ( equation ( [ eq14 ] ) ) . in more rigorous approximations with inclusion of spin",
    "correlators the energy bands should be more narrow ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    at the concentration @xmath213 fermi level coincides with van - hove singularity in singlet sub - band .",
    "but if we will neglect hopping on second coordination sphere ( nearest neighbor approximation ) then we will get the flattening of dispersion in @xmath214 direction and shift of van - hove singularities to higher energies",
    ". this will result in coincidence of fermi level and singularity in singlet sub - band at concentration @xmath215 .",
    "it is typical value for the t - j model with nearest neighbor hopping t. it is also known that in t - t-j model with the next - nearest neighbor hopping t the same shift in energies takes place so this phenomena is common both to t - t-j model and the effective singlet - triplet model . accepting the van - hove scenario of superconductivity , where the optimal doping correspond to coincident of fermi level with van - hove singularity",
    ", we can clearly see that this should happened at @xmath213 .",
    "meanwhile the experimentally obtained optimal doping value for @xmath97 is @xmath216 .",
    "so , either the van - hove scenario is not applicable or the model should be refined .",
    "this question could be answered only after the complete theory of superconductivity in the frame of the effective singlet - triplet model will be constructed .",
    "in present work we obtained the effective hamiltonian of the singlet - triplet model for copper oxides .",
    "being the generalization of the t - j model to account of two - particle triplet state resulting hamiltonian has several important features . at first ,",
    "the @xmath217 term appear which can have a non - trivial contribution to superconducting pairing .",
    "second , the account of a triplet leads to renormalization of exchange integral . and third , the singlet - triplet model is asymmetric for n- and p - type systems . for n - type systems the usual t - j model takes place while for p - type superconductors with complicated structure on the top of the valence band the singlet - triplet transitions plays an important role .",
    "the asymmetry of p- and n - type systems is known experimentally .",
    "the analysis of the possible processes in the effective singlet - triplet model shows that besides spin - fluctuation superconducting pairing mechanism typical for the t - j model we have pairing due to singlet - triplet transitions .",
    "these transitions induce spin - exciton which can play a role of intermediate boson in superconducting pairing .    we have also performed a symmetry classification of superconducting order parameter .",
    "it was shown that in case of tetragonal lattice s - type singlet pairing does nt take place while the @xmath1- and @xmath2-types of singlet pairing can exist .",
    "moreover , there must be a concurrence between @xmath1- and @xmath2-types . at the same time",
    ", @xmath2-type can exist only within the second coordination sphere and @xmath1-type can exist only within the first .",
    "this fact lets us to take into account only @xmath1-type symmetry of order parameter in nearest - neighbors approximation .    as concerns n - type cuprates , the gap symmetry was unclear for a long time .",
    "recently , phase sensitive tunnel experiments by tsuei and kirtley @xcite find an evidence for dominant @xmath1 symmetry in electron doped cuprates .",
    "this fact coincides with our results because in the limit of infinite energy of singlet - triplet excitation ( i.e. absence of excitations to the triplet states - this case corresponds to n - type cuprates ) our equations take the form of t - j model ones and the @xmath1-gap symmetry remain .    for normal paramagnetic phase we have obtained the energy dispersion over brillouin zone and calculated density of states .",
    "evolution of fermi level with doping is also found .",
    "both singlet and triplet excitations contributes to the density of states which leads to appearing of two van - hove singularities . at holes",
    "concentration @xmath213 the fermi level crosses the first van - hove singularity corresponding to singlet sub - band . and",
    "at holes concentration @xmath218 the fermi level crosses the second singularity corresponding to triplet sub - band .",
