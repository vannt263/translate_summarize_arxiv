    "a characteristic feature of continuous phase transitions , or critical points , is that the free energy , as well as time correlation functions , obey generalized homogeneity laws .",

    "quantum phase transitions , which occur at zero temperature as a function of some nonthermal control parameter such as composition , or pressure , are not yet as well understood .",
    "one feature that has slowed down progress has turned out to be a connection between quantum phase transitions and the phenomenon known as generic scale invariance , which refers to power - law decay of correlation functions in entire phases , not just at an isolated critical point .",
    "it turns out that the critical behavior at some classical phase transitions is also heavily influenced by a coupling between generic and critical scale invariance , but these phenomena have usually not been cast in this language .",
    "the goal of this review article is to give a unifying discussion of the coupling between critical behavior and generic scale invariance , for both classical and quantum phase transitions , and for both static and dynamic critical behavior .",
    "accordingly , we limit our discussion to phase transitions where this coupling is known or suspected to be important .",

    "[ sec : i ] we give a brief introduction to phase transitions , both classical and quantum . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] we discuss the concept of generic scale invariance , and illustrate it by means of various examples .",
    "these concepts are less well known than those pertaining to phase transitions , so our exposition is more elaborate . in secs . [",

    ". one could continue with a long list , but these three examples may suffice to demonstrate that phase transitions come in a wide variety of phenomenologies with no entirely obvious unifying features .",
    "accordingly , early attempts at theoretically understanding phase transitions focused on particular examples .",
    "@xcite developed the first example of what was later to become known as a `` mean - field theory '' , in this case , to describe the liquid - gas transition .",
    "@xcite gave a mean - field theory of ferromagnetism which was based on the concept of the `` mean field '' seen by each ` elementary magnet ' ( spin had yet to be discovered at that time ) that is produced by all other elementary magnets .",
    "a unification of all mean - field theories was achieved by @xcite ( all of these papers , or their translations , are reprinted in ) .",
    "he introduced the general concept of the `` order parameter '' , a thermodynamic observable that vanishes in one of the phases separated by the transition ( the `` disordered phase '' we will use the term `` disordered phase '' in the sense of `` phase without long - range order '' .",
    "this is not to be confused with the presence of quenched disorder , which we will also discuss . ] ) , and is nonzero in the other ( the `` ordered phase '' ) . in the case of the ferromagnet , the order parameter is the magnetization ; in the case of the liquid - gas transition , the density difference between the two phases .",
    "landau theory underlies all later theories of phase transitions , and we therefore discuss it first .",
    "landau theory is based on one crucial assumption , namely , that the free energy @xmath2 is an analytic function of the order parameter @xmath3 , in this section we consider a scalar order parameter for simplicity , but later we will encounter more general cases . ] and hence can be expanded in a power series , f f_(m ) = rm^2 + vm^3 + um^4 + o(m^5 ) .",

    "the reason for the failure of landau theory to correctly describe the details of the critical behavior is that it does not adequately treat the fluctuations of the order parameter about its mean value .",

    "the above chain of arguments implies that a quantum phase transition is closely related to the corresponding classical phase transition in a higher dimension .",
    "since this higher dimension will usually be above the upper critical dimension , the conclusion seems to be that quantum phase transitions generically show mean - field critical behavior , and are thus uninteresting from a critical phenomena point of view . in this review",
    "we discuss one of the reasons why this is in general not correct .",
    "more generally , we will discuss how the entire concept of a lgw theory in terms of a single order - parameter field can break down for either classical or quantum transitions , and why this breakdown is more common for the latter than for the former .",
    "the salient point is that a correct description of a phase transition , i.e. , of phenomena at long length and time scales , must take into account _ all _ soft modes . if there are soft modes in addition to the order - parameter fluctuations , and if the former couple sufficiently strongly to the latter , then the behavior can not be described in terms of a local field theory for the order - parameter fluctuations only . away from the quantum phase transition , these extra soft modes , via interactions or nonlinear couplings , lead to power - law correlations in various physical correlation functions . this phenomenon is called generic scale invariance and we will discuss it in sec .",

    "conservation laws in conjunction with a nonequilibrium situation @xcite can leads to long - ranged time correlation functions and thermodynamic quantities even in classical systems .    in what follows we discuss specific examples , starting with classical systems .",
