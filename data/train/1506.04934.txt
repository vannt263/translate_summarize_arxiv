    "in various applications arising in statistical mechanics , biochemistry , data science and machine learning @xcite , it is often necessary to compute expectations @xmath0 of an observable @xmath1 with respect to a target probability distribution @xmath2 on @xmath3 with density @xmath4 with respect to the lebesgue measure , known up to the normalization constant both the measure and the density ] . when the dimension @xmath5 is large , standard deterministic quadrature approaches become intractable , and one typically resorts to markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods @xcite . in this approach , @xmath6 is approximated by a long - time average of the form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a markov process chosen to be ergodic with respect to the target distribution @xmath9 .",

    "may be used , which in general , will not be ergodic with respect to the target distribution @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the discretisation is augmented with a metropolis - hastings accept / reject step @xcite which guarantees that the resulting markov chain remains reversible with respect to @xmath9 .",

    "moreover , through a spectral decomposition of the operator @xmath43 we investigate the dependence of the asymptotic variance on the strength of the nonreversible perturbation .",
    "based on earlier work by golden and papanicolaou @xcite , majda et al @xcite and bhattacharya et al @xcite , in @xcite , an expression is obtained for the effective self - diffusion coefficient for a tagged particle whose microscopic behaviour is determined by a nonreversible markov process . the basic idea is the introduction of the operator @xmath44 which is skewadjoint in the weighted sobolev space @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the @xmath20 inner product ; see section [ sec : var_anal ] .",
    "we follow a similar approach in this paper , from which a quite explicit formula for the asymptotic variance @xmath47 is derived using the spectral theorem for selfadjoint operators . from this expression",

    "an equivalent formulation of this result is that an incompressible flow is relaxation enhancing if and only if it is weakly mixing .",
    "examples of relaxation enhancing flows are given in  @xcite .",
    "this problem was studied further in  @xcite , where it also mentioned that there are very few examples of relaxation enhancing flows . in @xcite",

    "moreover , we demonstrate that the conditions under which the variance is reduced are very different from those of maximising the spectral gap discussed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we show how a nonreversible perturbation can dramatically reduce the asymptotic variance for the estimator @xmath14 , even though no such improvement can be made on the rate of convergence to equilibrium .",

    "the resulting discretisation error introduces an additional bias in the estimator for @xmath6 , see @xcite for a comprehensive error analysis .",
    "this imposes additional constraints on the magnitude of the nonreversible drift , since increasing @xmath35 arbitrarily will give rise to a large discretisation error which must be controlled by taking smaller timesteps . a natural question",

    "our numerical results , together with the theoretical analysis for diffusions with linear drift , show that the nonreversible langevin sampler can outperform the mala algorithm , provided that the nonreversible perturbation is well  chosen .",

    "moreover , following the analysis described in @xcite , we derive a spectral representation for the asymptotic variance @xmath30 , in terms of the discrete spectrum of the operator @xmath63 defined in ( [ eq : operator_g ] ) , and recover estimates for the asymptotic variance for any value of @xmath35 . in section [ sec : gauss cxx ] , we consider the case of gaussian diffusions , which are amenable to explicit calculation to demonstrate the theory presented in this paper . in section [ sec :",
