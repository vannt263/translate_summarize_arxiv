    "[ corrd0 ] .",
    "it is apparent that the main origin of the nonadiabaticity comes from p1 and p2 excitations and their multiplicities .",
    "the corresponding elementary particle exchange process is a loss of particle from the highest @xmath43 mott zone to @xmath45 ( p2 ) or to @xmath62 ( p1 ) .",
    "excitation of type s are slightly different : indeed , there , the particle is removed from mott plateau @xmath32 and added in mott plateau @xmath63 when the two sites are on opposite sides , it simply corresponds to a right or left shift of plateau @xmath32 by one site .",
    "for example , the s3 component has a squared overlap of less than 1% , still the analysis of the associated state by our method confirms that assignment .",
    "this process for other mott zones ( s2 and s1 ) is not observed .",
    "there is however another possibility for s excitations : if the @xmath53 and @xmath10 neighboring sites are on the same side , it is associated with a hole in the @xmath32-plateau ( can be viewed also as an extra particle in the @xmath64 plateau ) , and  because @xmath53 and @xmath10 are neighbors  it costs some kinetic energy .",
    "thus one can expect the 4-fold degeneracy of the s excitations at @xmath51 to be rapidly lifted to a 2-fold degeneracy only for relatively small @xmath11 . also , the same - side excitation is dynamically unstable and unlikely to be significantly excited in our wavepacket .",
    "we do not observe significant contributions of processes involving exchange of particles between @xmath47 to @xmath45 zones only ( d type ) .",
    "a qualitative explanation for that fact might be that formation of @xmath47 and @xmath45 zones takes time earlier in the ramping - up process ( for larger @xmath65 ) .",

    "it may be directly observable as an increased variance of nonlocal observables such as number of particles in one half of the system .",
    "if one measured the number or particles to the left of the middle site , the statistical distribution stemming from independent realizations of the experiment would have a large number variance , much larger than the local particle number variance at the given site .",
    "this directly follows from the symmetry - breaking description and the presented data , as different eigenstates building the wavepacket have different number of particles in one half of the system ( jump of a particle from one half of the system to the other ) than in the other half .",
    "slight symmetry breaking allows to analyze constituents of the symmetric eigenstates .",
    "it turns out that excitations differing by a long range particle jump are less probable , but not completely negligible .",
    "a few questions arise .",
    "firstly , we have considered only the deep lattice regime .",
    "if the lattice was shallower , what would be the nature of excitations present in the system ? secondly many more excitations would be present if the system was in the significantly nonzero temperature - how would it affect properties of the system such as the mentioned long range coherence and its decoherence ?",
