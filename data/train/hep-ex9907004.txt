    "presented analysis is based on experimental data collected in the center - of - mass energy region 9801040  @xmath16 , with most of the data , taken in the close vicinity of the @xmath17 peak .",

    "the search for the @xmath0 decay was performed using the process @xmath23 in this process the @xmath24 having momentum of about @xmath25 and decay length of @xmath26 may either produce signals in the detector due to nuclear interaction in the calorimeter or decay in flight , or it can punch through the detector unseen . the detection efficiency of @xmath24 mesons in the calorimeter material was studied in the process @xmath27 with the probability of @xmath28 the @xmath24 produces a single cluster of hit crystals in the calorimeter , and with the @xmath29 probability  more than one cluster .",

    "constraints were imposed on total energy deposition ( @xmath31 ) and total momentum of events ( @xmath32 ) , where @xmath33 is a beam energy . to suppress cosmic background even further , the events , where the most of hit crystals could be fitted by a single straight track , were rejected . due to worse energy resolution near",

    "kinematic fitting based on @xmath36-method was performed for the events satisfying selection criteria described above . for each event",

    ", the following cuts were applied :    * @xmath48 * @xmath49 * @xmath50    as a result significant part of background events of the processes ( [ ks3eq3 ] ) and ( [ ks3eq2 ] ) was rejected .",
    "the total of 19 6-photon and 15 7-photon events survived the cuts .",
    "the process ( [ ks3eq2 ] ) was used as a reference for the detection efficiency monitoring .",
    "the events with 4 and 5 reconstructed photons were selected using the same primary cuts as for the process ( [ ks3eq1 ] ) .",
    "after kinematic fitting the following additional cuts were applied :    * @xmath51 * @xmath52 * @xmath53    the @xmath41 and @xmath43 distributions for experimental and simulated events of the process ( [ ks3eq2 ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ ks3fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ ks3fig2 ] .    further analysis of the process ( [ ks3eq1 ] ) candidates was performed separately for events with 6 and 7 photons .",
    "the reference process ( [ ks3eq2 ] ) was studied in 4- and 5-photon classes respectively .",
    "in the events of the process ( [ ks3eq1 ] ) with 7 reconstructed photons , one of the photons must be in fact a @xmath24 meson , thus additional cuts on its parameters can be imposed . in the analysis",
    "it was required that energy deposition of @xmath24 cluster is at least @xmath54 , and spatial angle between the cluster and reconstructed @xmath2 direction is more than @xmath55 degrees .",
    "the following cuts were based on specific for @xmath24 profiles of energy deposition in the calorimeter .",
    "the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 were introduced to quantitatively describe the differences between the energy deposition profiles for photons and @xmath24 mesons .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 @xcite represents the likelihood of a hypothesis that the transverse profile of energy deposition in a cluster was produced by a single photon .",

    "the same requirement was applied to @xmath24 meson in 5-photon events of the reference process ( [ ks3eq2 ] ) .    as a result",
    "the number of selected events was @xmath60 for the process ( [ ks3eq1 ] ) and @xmath61 for the process ( [ ks3eq2 ] ) . the detection efficiencies @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the processes ( [ ks3eq1 ] ) and ( [ ks3eq2 ] ) were calculated by monte carlo simulation using unimod2 package @xcite",
    ". the branching ratio of the @xmath0 decay was calculated as follows : @xmath64 an upper limit was obtained at @xmath14 confidence level : @xmath65",
    "in 6-photon ( [ ks3eq1 ] ) candidates all detected particle must be photons .",
    "thus the remaining ( [ ks3eq2 ] ) background can be suppressed by the following cuts on @xmath56 and @xmath57 : @xmath66 and @xmath67 for all six particles .",
    "it was required also that raw invariant masses of photon pairs , reconstructed as pions are restricted to the range @xmath68 .",
    "the same cuts were used in parallel analysis of 4-photon events of the reference process ( [ ks3eq2 ] ) .",
    "the detection efficiencies of processes ( [ ks3eq1 ] ) and ( [ ks3eq2 ] ) were obtained by monte carlo simulation to be @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "@xmath71 events of the process ( [ ks3eq1 ] ) and @xmath72 events of process ( [ ks3eq2 ] ) survived the cuts .",
    "the upper limit at the confidence level of @xmath14 is : @xmath73",
    "by using the following relation between numbers of found events of the processes ( [ ks3eq1 ] ) and ( [ ks3eq2 ] ) : @xmath74 the results of both analyses can be combined : @xmath75 the resulting upper limit according to eq.([ks3eq9 ] ) amounts to @xmath76 at the confidence level of @xmath14 .",
    "the systematic error of the detection efficiency is determined mainly by imprecise simulation of @xmath24 nuclear interaction .",
    "its estimated value is @xmath30 .",
    "since the ( [ ks3eq1 ] ) branching ratio depends on the ratio of the detection efficiencies for the processes ( [ ks3eq1 ] ) and ( [ ks3eq2 ] ) , the common systematic error in the @xmath24 simulation cancels . the remaining systematic error in the efficiency ratio",
    "is determined mainly by the accuracy of simulation of electromagnetic showers . in order to estimate this error , the process ( [ ks3eq3 ] )",
    "was studied with the cuts similar to those in the analysis of process ( [ ks3eq1 ] ) .",
    "resulting branching ratio of @xmath77 is @xmath78 lower than its world averaged value @xcite .",
