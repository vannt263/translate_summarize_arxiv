    "thermal and cold neutrons play an important role for fundamental research , on one hand as a probe to study condensed matter systems and for inducing nuclear reactions , on the other hand as an object and a tool for studying low - energy particle physics via precise measurements of the static and decay properties of the neutron .",
    "cold neutrons are commonly produced by slowdown from thermal energies , using a cold medium with a suitable dynamical structure factor and weak absorption .",
    "liquid hydrogen and deuterium held at the respective boiling points at about @xmath9 and @xmath10 k are particularly effective for moderation and have gained practical importance as `` cold neutron sources '' implemented in high - flux neutron research facilities .",
    "for instance , a liquid - deuterium cold source at the institut laue langevin ( ill ) in grenoble , france , provides a gain factor @xmath11 for low - energy neutrons with wavelengths @xmath12 @xcite . for",
    "further cooling of neutrons one would need a colder medium with suitable degrees of freedom .",
    "collective excitations such as phonons in a cold solid with debye temperature @xmath13 are however rather inappropriate for moderation since for neutron energy , @xmath14 , the cross section for single phonon emission is proportional to @xmath15 , and cross sections for higher order processes drop even faster with decreasing energy @xcite .",
    "localized , dispersion - free excitations on the other hand do not suffer from this limitation and may work even at lowest neutron energies .",
    "a peculiar , forty years old proposal of `` phononless cooling of neutrons to extremely low temperatures '' involves tiny energy transfers in units of neutron and nuclear zeeman energy @xcite . in a moderator comprized of deuterons with nuclear spins highly polarized along a strong magnetic field , conservation of angular momentum",
    "allows simultaneous neutron and nuclear spin flips to happen only in the doublet state and hence , due to the associated positive change of zeeman energies , only with the removal of neutron kinetic energy .",
    "since even in magnetic fields of several tesla this amounts to less than a @xmath16 , many spin flip collisions will be necessary for significant neutron cooling .",
    "the author of the proposal pointed out that , even for an ideally polarized deuteron system in a field as strong as @xmath17 t , cooling to extremely low temperatures would take effect only after preliminary cooling of the neutron spectrum to at least @xmath18 k. these conditions explain why the proposal has not yet been put into practice .",
    "a similar situation appears in refrigeration of bulk matter to lowest temperatures using adiabatic nuclear demagnetization .",
    "a popular method to achieve the necessary precooling is adiabatic demagnetization of paramagnetic salts , which due to the large electronic magnetic moments is much better adapted for cooling at a higher temperature than a nuclear stage .    guided by this analogy we are led to consider slowdown of neutrons due to scattering by a paramagnetic system at low temperature , which has not yet been reported in the literature . here",
    ", the transfer of energy in a scattering process with electron spin flip is typically three orders of magnitude larger than for nuclear spin flip scattering , due to the ratio of the bohr and nuclear magnetons . for simple paramagnetic atomic or ionic species it is determined by an external field , whereas magnetic molecules possess zero - field splittings of magnetic energy levels able to remove neutron kinetic energy even without an external field . as a consequence of the non - dispersivity of paramagnetic excitations",
    ", neutron cooling can proceed in inelastic , incoherent scattering cascades with energy decrement @xmath19 of typically a fraction of a .",
    "a particular motivation for this study is the quest for efficient production methods of neutrons in the low - energy range of the spectrum provided by a cold source , commonly called very cold neutrons ( vcn ) and ultra - cold neutrons ( ucn ) .",
    "more intense beams of vcn would enhance capabilities of neutron scattering techniques such as reflectometry , spin echo spectroscopy and interferometry , to mention only some classical applications .",
    "they may also offer new opportunities for fundamental physics projects , such as beam - based searches for a non - vanishing neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) @xcite , for neutron - antineutron oscillations @xcite , or for new fundamental forces @xcite .",
    "ucn on the other hand can be trapped in bottles made of materials with positive neutron optical potential , by magnetic field gradients , and by gravity golub/1991,ignatovich/1990 .",
    "owing to this peculiar property they have become a valuable tool for a plethora of investigations in fundamental physics @xcite .",
    "a classical method for production of ucn and vcn at the ill extracts low - energy neutrons from a liquid - deuterium moderator through a vertical neutron guide , followed by a phase space transformation to lowest energies using a neutron turbine @xcite .",
    "more recently , alternative methods have begun to provide competitive ucn densities lauer/2013,frei/2007,saunders/2013,masuda/2012,lauss/2012,zimmer/2011,zimmer/2010 .",
    "they involve conversion of cold neutrons in single inelastic scattering events @xcite , instead of multiple energy transfers characteristic for neutron slowdown in a moderator . in its simplest form the converter acts as an effective two - level system with an excited state separated by an energy @xmath20 from the ground state . at temperatures @xmath21 the excited state",
    "is strongly depleted , leading to a suppression of neutron up - scattering back to higher energy .",
    "converter materials investigated so far are superfluid helium golub/1977 , solid deuterium @xcite , solid @xmath22-oxygen @xcite and solid @xmath23n @xcite .",
    "all cases employ phonons ( with a contribution of magnons for @xmath22-oxygen ) , with @xmath20 in the order of one to several mev ( e.g. , @xmath24 mev for superfluid @xmath1he ) .    for paramagnetic scattering typical single energy transfers",
    "are smaller ( e.g. , @xmath25 mev for molecular oxygen encaged in the inclusion compounds discussed below ) . more importantly and contrary to dispersive , collective excitations , energy transfers can be cascaded over a comb of many equidistant neutron energy groups within a broad incident neutron spectrum . here",

    "a further point to be studied is the transparency of the medium for neutrons having reached wavelengths @xmath204 after the final cooling step .",
    "this will depend on the level of inhomogeneity scattering @xcite due to the mesostructure , determined by size , packing and microporosity of clathrate grains @xcite .",
    "for implementation of the material in intense neutron fields also the question of radiation damage needs to be addressed .",
    "an `` in - pile '' o@xmath0-hydrate moderator may provide highest fluxes of vcn and ucn .",
    "highest ultimate ucn densities might however be attained in pure superfluid @xmath1he due to its vanishing neutron absorption , enabling ucn accumulation prior to extraction from the converter @xcite .",
    "also in this situation the clathrate may become an asset , as a moderating reflector around a superfluid @xmath1he ucn source placed at the end of a neutron guide @xcite .",
    "keeping the clathrate at @xmath205 , the spectrum of an incident neutron beam will be compressed to provide an optimum density at @xmath206 , where the one - phonon process for ucn production in superfluid @xmath1he takes effect .    among the other media considered in this paper ,",
    "also the dry o@xmath0-@xmath1he van der waals cluster system deserves further investigation for its much lower absorption . as this material becomes unstable at much lower temperatures than the o@xmath0-hydrate ( see a phase diagram for the similar n@xmath197-hydrate in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it might be rather a candidate for implementation at a neutron beam than in - pile .",
    "even more exotic are the paramagnetic atomic zeeman systems , which however offer a linear dependence of the neutron transfer energy on an applied magnetic field .",
    "this degree of freedom might be exploitable in some special experimental situations .",
    "the absence of dispersion in neutron scattering by paramagnetic systems has the additional interesting consequence that neutron conversion to ucn takes place in a narrow energy range of a fraction of a @xmath16 .",
    "this strongly contrasts with the dispersive single - phonon emission process in superfluid @xmath1he , which , for instance for a spectrum up to a cutoff at @xmath207 , is kinematically allowed in a wide energy range of @xmath208 about @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "while for the helium case the large mean free path of neutrons with energy @xmath209 can in principle be used to enhance the ucn density by a neutron beam resonator @xcite , the paramagnetic moderator with its narrow energy range for neutron conversion is amenable to beam bunching techniques applicable for pulsed neutron sources , as described in ref .",
    "we finally note that it might also be worthwhile to consider the combination of paramagnetic neutron cooling with namiot s original proposal , thus putting into practice a two - stage neutron cascade cooler in which the spin dependent nuclear scattering compresses the neutron phase space at lowest energies .",
    "in this appendix we derive the inelastic neutron scattering cross sections needed for the analysis of neutron conversion and cascade cooling by paramagnetic centers .",

    "while this can in fact be easily accomplished for paramagnetic systems , expressions for such inelastic cross sections seem not to appear in the literature , probably because the usually small energy transfer in the diffuse scattering associated with an electron spin flip is only of limited interest for structural studies . as argued in the main text , the inelastic neutron scattering due to the zero - field splitting in oxygen seems to have already been observed in two experimental studies @xcite , where it was however temptatively interpreted as a crystal field effect .",
