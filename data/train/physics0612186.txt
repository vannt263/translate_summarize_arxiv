    "recently a big progress has been made in application of digital technique in experimental physics what allows to perform milestone physics experiments even in student laboratories .",
    "a good example is the perrin experiment [ 1 ] considered as the first one directly proving the atomic structure of matter .",
    "however , its verification at university laboratories [ 2],[3],[4],[5 ] due to small statistics one takes , may meet some difficulties ( see e.g.[2],[4],[5 ] ) .",
    "the linear dependence between the average square displacement @xmath2 of the particle in media due to its brownian motion and the observation time @xmath3 as required by the einstein - smoluchowski diffusion law often becomes very problematic .",
    "+ it is essential therefore to examine the minimal statistics ( number of tracked particles ) one should take into account in the limited observation time to reveal the major feature of the diffusion law .",
    "we propose the analytical model which can be also easy simulated numerically .",
    "the aim of this model is to investigate how the results of @xmath4 versus @xmath3 depend on the statistics and what the scaling range of the expected linear relationship is .",
    "this study should help to set up the experiment properly as well as to analyze the obtained results more correctly .",
    "+ in the next section we present the model directly reflecting the physics standing behind the perrin experiment . in section 3",
    "the results of numerical simulation of this model are described and main features of diffusion relation with its scaling range are revealed for various number of particles to be observed . to avoid the problem of small statistics causing departures from the strict power law behavior we introduce and discuss the idea of artificially increased statistics(ais ) in section 4 .",
    "this method is then applied both to the results of numerical simulation and to some experimental data .",
    "we argue the method may significantly decrease the level of statistical noise in data , leading to much better agreement with the linear dependence in diffusion theory . in the last section summary of obtained results is given .",
    "the most popular derivation of the diffusion law in media with viscosity comes from einstein [ 6 ] , langevin [ 7 ] and smoluchowski [ 8 ] . here",
    "we propose another approach based on the time series analysis combined with the average time @xmath5 between consecutive collisions of the tracked mesoscopic particles with other particles in liquid ( i.e. @xmath5 has the meaning of the average time between collisions which significantly change the motion of the tracked object ) .",
    "such approach seems to be closer to the spirit of the original perrin experiment [ 1 ] .",
    "+ let the trajectory of the observed particle of mass @xmath6 moving in @xmath7-dimensional space is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "we assume @xmath8 to be discrete @xmath7-dimensional time series with constant spacing @xmath5 in time ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the obvious notation @xmath11    and    @xmath12    will be applied , where @xmath13 is the instantenous displacement of the particle at @xmath14 .    for the stationary , integer brownian motion ( no displacement correlation ) with no drift one has for large @xmath15 : @xmath16    and    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the average taken over the ensamble of @xmath15 tracked particles and @xmath19 is the standard deviation of instantenous displacements , i.e. :    @xmath20    the total mean squared displacement @xmath21 of particles from their initial positions after @xmath22 collisions can be easy calculated with the help of eq .",
    "( 5 ) :    @xmath23    in order to calculate @xmath24 let us notice that    @xmath25    with @xmath26 being the average velocity of the @xmath27 - th particle between collisions . hence from eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and(7 ) :    @xmath28    the equipartition theorem establishes the connection of microscopic quantities with the absolute temperature @xmath29 and the boltzmann constant @xmath30 :    @xmath31    therefore eq .  ( 6 ) reads :    @xmath32    the above formula is the standard diffusion law with the diffusion constant    @xmath33    expressed in terms of @xmath5 .",
    "+ usually one writes @xmath1 in terms of liquid viscosity @xmath34 as    @xmath35    where @xmath36 ( stokes law ) and @xmath37 being the radius of the considered mesoscopic particles .",
    "+ hence one gets the simple relation between parameter @xmath5 in the model and macroscopic quantities @xmath6 , @xmath38 :    @xmath39    thus the model reproducing the known diffusion law also estimates the average time @xmath5 lapsing between consecutive collisions in the system as the simple function of macroscopically measured quantities .",
    "this time can be taken as the input parameter in the numerical study of the perrin experiment what is done in the next section .",
    "the solution in eq .  ( 10 ) can be checked via numerical simulation of the brownian motion in viscous media .",
    "in fact this simulation is the only way one can find the sufficient statistics , i.e. the number of tracked particles in the ensamble one should observe in real experiment to obtain results confirming the linear relation .",
    "if sufficient statistics requirement is not satisfied , one observes significant departures from the linear behavior @xmath40 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "[ 2 ] , [ 4 ] ) .",
    "+ we simulated all time series @xmath41 in @xmath42 dimensions usually discussed by experimentalists .",
    "the time series were built in the well known iterative way    @xmath43    @xmath44    where displacements have been generated as the random gaussian numbers @xmath45 , with the standard deviation @xmath46 obtained from eqs .",
    "( 8),(9 ) .",
    "all simulations were performed for the case of diffusion in pure water @xmath47 , room temperature @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 what roughly corresponds to the real perrin experiment parameters . + the essential task to be done just in the beginning was to determine the scaling range @xmath51 of the discussed linear dependence as a function of the number of tracked particles @xmath15 .",
    "it was done for the bunch of simulated trajectories varying the number of observed particles in the range @xmath52 .",
    "the bunch of twenty trajectories was investigated for any @xmath15 in the above range .",
    "the examples of just five runs in each bunch ( for the clarity of figure we do not show all the runs ) are pictured in fig.1 a - d .",
    "hence we have found the scaling range relation revealed in fig.2 .",
    "the best fit gives @xmath53 where @xmath54 and the uncertainty comes from the statistics .",
    "+ let us notice that if the number of observed particles does not exceed @xmath55 the linear dependence @xmath56 can be confirmed only for the observation time @xmath57 !",
    "it makes the analysis taking into account longer observation times ( as authors of ref .",
    "[ 4 ] did ) , simply incorrect .    having",
    "the scaling range determined we may proceed to calculate the diffusion constant value and its expected standard deviation from the mean .",
    "such analysis was done by us for the simulated trajectories mentioned above . some chosen cases ( again for the clarity of graph",
    "we do not show all of them ) with maximal and minimal values of @xmath1 for every @xmath15 are shown in fig.3 a - d .",
    "all results of the mean @xmath1 values and their standard deviation as the function of @xmath15 are presented in fig.4 .",
    "hence we see that the final result within @xmath58 percent of the expected theoretical value can be found only if one considers the ensamble of @xmath59 particles .",
    "the results of the previous section seem to suggest that to get a reasonable agreement with the diffusion law predictions one should take into account in the real experiment data from at least @xmath60 particles . in many less professional labs ( e.g. student labs )",
    "such a requirement is virtually impossible to be satisfied - mainly because of the limited time duration of the data collection if no sophisticated computerized apparatus is used .",
    "below we give the idea that helps to overcome such a difficulty .",
    "we call it artificially increased statistics ( ais ) . + the main idea of ais is to build the statistics of consecutive displacements from the very small number of available trajectories , counting all the displacements not from the initial starting point @xmath61 but varying it along the whole one particle trajectory . thus any momentary position of the particle , say @xmath62 is the starting point to collect statistics of all displacements afterwards , i.e. @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the @xmath38-th part of the @xmath65 step displacement . this way for the time series of length @xmath22 we have @xmath66 data for @xmath6-steps displacements instead of just one displacement usually taken into account",
    ". then the statistics is averaged in the usual way over the all considered ( observed ) particles .",
    "this way even if @xmath15 is small the overall number of data entering the statistics is large enough to fulfil the linear law expectation .",
    "let us now look at the results of the application of ais to the simulated brownian motion as well as to the pure experimental data from the real experiments .",
    "in fig.5a - b we present the bunch of squared displacements in time taken for the statistics of @xmath67(a ) and @xmath68(b ) particles worked out with the ais procedure .",
    "the comparison with the `` naked '' data from fig.3a - b shows the tremendous difference .",
    "although the scaling range after ais lifting does not seem to change a lot , the linear dependence @xmath69 is now much more convincing .",
    "in fact the comparison of diffusion constants @xmath1 obtained from the `` naked '' analysis and from the data lifted by ais shows about 7 times smaller uncertainty in @xmath1     & (  naked  data ) & & (  naked  data ) & & & & & 1 .",

    "the corresponding result for the @xmath68 case is improved about @xmath72 times .",
    "+ we have calculated also the mean absolute error ( mae)defined as    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the theoretical value of the diffusion coefficient ( @xmath75 for the considered diffusion process ) and the sum is taken over all simulated runs . + for the sample of @xmath55 runs with and without ais one obtains for @xmath67 particles @xmath76 decreasing to @xmath77 when ais is switched on . the corresponding result for @xmath68 particles",
    "are ( in @xmath78 ) @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "+ the positive feature of ais procedure can also be seen directly with the pure experimental data .",
    "we show in fig .  6a the data taken in ref .  [ 4 ] for the diffusion of @xmath81 latex spherical particles in the pure water .",
    "one gets much better correspondence with the linear dependence when ais procedure is applied to these experimental points , what is clearly revealed in fig.6b .",
    "the obtained best fit for the diffusion constant corresponds now closely to the expected theoretical value @xmath82 what is not the case of the fit obtained by authors of ref .  [ 4 ] .",
    "the proper determination of the scaling range for the linear dependence @xmath83 is crucial in the data analysis . we argued this scaling range behaves like @xmath84 , where the constant @xmath85 was determined as @xmath86 .",
    "the numerical simulation shows that for the case of mesoscopic particles diffusing in water the scaling range for @xmath87 particles is as short as @xmath88 .",
    "for @xmath89 this scaling range is difficult to determine at all . in many papers",
    "this fact is ignored what gives misleading results .",
    "+ however , even if one remains in the scaling range regime the results of simulated runs are not always statistically repeatable if too small statistics is considered . the minimal number of tracked particles to reveal the diffusion law is @xmath90 .",
    "one may nevertheless find the reasonable correspondence between theoretical predictions and experimental results even for the smaller number of tracked particles if the idea of ais is applied . in this paper",
    "we have described this idea and have shown how it works for simulated data as well as for data taken from the real experiments .",
    "it turns out that with ais analysis one may get results within @xmath58 of the expected theoretical value of the diffusion constant tracking just few mesoscopic objects .",
    "the corresponding input data without ais gives much bigger uncertainty of the order of @xmath91 ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "the same applies when mae is calculated . to decrease the uncertainty to the former level of @xmath58",
    "one has to track roughly ten times more objects !",
    "+ we have checked that for @xmath68 tracked particles ais procedure decreases the statistical uncertainty in @xmath1 from about @xmath92 ( the `` naked '' data case ) to @xmath93 .",
    "simultaneously the @xmath94 drops down about twice ( from @xmath95 to @xmath96 ) .",
    "the ais procedure is here less impressive than for @xmath67 case but still shows the significant improvement in data results .",
    "+ this way it is quite possible to collect data giving very good prediction for the diffusion constant even in less professional labs where one is not able to measure simultaneously signals coming from bigger number of objects .",
    "hence , other important physical constants ( like e.g. boltzmann constant @xmath30 or the avogadro number @xmath97 ) can be deduced with high accuracy what is often the crucial point of such experiments .",
    "+ the simulations were done by us also for liquids with other viscosities .",
    "the same final conclusions as for the case of water can be formulated .",
    "because of very similar results we did not show them explicitly in this paper",
    "but we believe they should be studied in the way of numerical simulation in any case before the actual experiment is planned .    9 j.b .",
