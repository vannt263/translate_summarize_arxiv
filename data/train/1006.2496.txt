    "many semiconductor devices rely on excess charge carriers which are either injected or else created by absorbing photons ( sze , 1981 ) .",
    "electron - hole recombination is therefore a process which is central to undestanding the dynamics of these systems .",
    "the radiative and non - radiative mechanisms for recombination have been extensively studied , starting with seminal work of shockley and read ( 1952 ) . in this paper",
    "i shall argue that there is a universal regime for the kinetics of recombination which has not been described in earlier work .",
    "the evidence comes from considering an anomalous exponent describing the response of photoconductors , where the photoconductance @xmath0 and the light intensity @xmath1 are typically related by @xmath2 : values close to @xmath5 are frequently observed , whereas conventional theory only gives a satisfactory account for @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "i argue that accounting for the role of coulomb interaction in the kinetics of electron - hole recombination leads to an explantion for the anomalous exponent , @xmath7 . a version of this model which uses the hot - carrier concept ( discussed in ziman , 1972 ) , as opposed to linear response , provides the most satisfying description and the best fit to experimental data .",
    "this model gives @xmath5 in three dimesnions , and @xmath6 for two - dimesnional systems , where the photoresponsive layer is very shallow .",
    "the photocurrent excited in a semiconductor might be intuitively expected to be proportional to the light intensity , and there are reasonable models ( discussed below ) which do imply a linear dependence .",
    "a simple and plausible argument however leads to a different conclusion . consider a simple photocell consisting of a semiconductor ( undoped ) with two electrodes attached .",
    "light falling on the device creates electron - hole pairs ( at a rate which is proportional to the intensity of radiation , @xmath1 ) .",
    "these mobile carriers allow the device to conduct electricity , with a conductivity @xmath0 , which is proportional to the density of charge carriers .",
    "if the density of mobile electrons is @xmath8 and the density of holes is @xmath9 , the conductivity is @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the electron and hole diffusion coefficients , and @xmath13 is the electron charge . because the semiconductor is assumed to be intrinsic , the number of electrons equals the number of holes , so that @xmath14 . the rate of change of the excitation density @xmath15 contains a source term , proprtional to the intensity , and a sink term , which represents the rate for electron - hole recombination : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a constant and @xmath18 is the rate for recombination of electron - hole pairs at density @xmath15 .",
    "it is natural to invoke the law of mass action , and to propose that the rate of recombination is proportional to the product of the number density of electrons and of holes : that is the recombination term is @xmath19 ( for some constant @xmath20 ) , so that @xmath21 . in this case",
    "the equilibrium concentration @xmath15 and consequently the conductance are proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "thus there appear to be two plausible models for the recombination rate , which are distinguished by looking at the exponent @xmath7 for a power - law dependence of conductance @xmath23 upon light intensity : @xmath24 the model described above indicates @xmath4 .",
    "the intuitive expectation that @xmath3 is consistent with a picture where the electrons and holes become immobilised on recombination centres , which exist independently of the illumination .",
    "it is not immediately clear which value of @xmath7 is correct , and it is necessary to turn to experiment to decide the issue .",
    "both values , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are observed in different experiments , corresponding respectively to mobile charge carriers being destroyed by monomolecular or bimolecular processes . but",
    "a surprising aspect of the experimental literature is that intermediate values of @xmath7 ( hereafter termed _ anomalous _ ) are often observed over several decades of intensity .",
    "the existence of anomalous exponents has been discussed by rose ( 1963 ) , but his model is unsatisfying because it assumes that there is a set of impurity states in the band gap with a density of states which is an exponential function of energy .",
    "careful studies of lifshitz tails pioneered by halperin and lax ( 1966 ) indicate that the density of states has a more complex functional dependence , such as an exponential of a power of energy ( measured from the band edge ) : see thirumalai ( 1986 ) . because of these results it seems implausible to use an assumption that the density of states is a simple exponential in order to explain an anomalous response which has a well - defined exponent over decades of intensity .",
    "the model described by rose is also vulnerable to a more fundamental objection , namely that it relies on an artificial demarcation between electron states which are traps and those which are recombination centres .",
    "the theory proposed by rose indicates that @xmath25 should have a monotonic variation with temperature .",
    "this hypothesis is not compatible with experimental observations by wronski and daniel ( 1981 ) where the temperature was varied over a wide range : the exponent of the anomalous regime was found to be insensitive to temperature ( which is consistent with the universality hypothesis developed in this paper ) .",
    "reading the literature suggests that where anaomalous exponents are reported , they are frequently close to @xmath26 , particularly in cases where a convincing fit to a power - law is demonstrated over two or more decades of intensity .",
    "the works which i have become aware of are discussed in section [ sec : 2 ] .",
    "allowing for errors in fitting the exponent , the experimental results suggest that @xmath5 could be a universal exponent for the anomalous regime .",
    "the samples used in experiments where the anamalous response is observed often require specialist equipment for their preparation , and the reported values of @xmath7 are not always consistent . in view of the very surprising nature of the anomalous photoconductive response , it is desirable to characterise the effect in a readily accessible system . as well as reviewing the experimental literature , section [ sec : 2 ] will discuss the intensity dependence of the conductance of some commercially available photocells . an anomalous photoconductive response with @xmath5",
    "was observed in three of the four samples .",
    "the remaining one showed an anomalous regime with @xmath6 .",
    "section [ sec : 3 ] discusses the theory for the rate of recombination .",
    "it is pointed out that the law of mass action assumes implicitly that electrons and holes find each other ( @xmath4 case ) or a recombination trap ( @xmath3 case ) by diffusion . because the electrons and holes are electrically charged",
    ", there is a regime in which their attraction ensures that they collide more rapidly than if their motion was undirected diffusion .",
    "i show how this leads to a model for the anomalous exponent @xmath7 .",
    "the value of @xmath7 predicted by this model depends upon how the carrier drift velocity @xmath27 varies with the electric field @xmath28 .",
    "the natural assumption is to apply linear response theory , and to assume that @xmath29 .",
    "however , the electric field due to the electrostatic attraction of the carriers is extremely large .",
    "it is known that for very large electric fields the motion of charge carriers becomes very insensitive to the electric field ( ziman , 1972 ) .",
    "this is accounted for by assuming @xmath30 , with @xmath31 very small . in the limit as @xmath32 ,",
    "the expression for the anomalous exponent gives @xmath5 in three dimensions and @xmath6 in two dimensions .",
    "anomalous photoconductive response has been observed in a wide variety of semiconductors and semiconductor based devices .",
    "the results which i have found reported are summarised in table [ tab : 1 ] . some authors ( bakr , 2002 , kaplan and kaplan , 1998 , 2002 , spear _ et al _ , 1974 ) report a broad range of values of @xmath7 , with the exponent depending upon temperature , or other parameters . in the remaining cases where either a single value of @xmath25 or a narrow range is reported , its value appears to lie in the range @xmath33 , apart from three outliers which are discussed below .",
    "small deviations of the exponent fitted in experiments can result from various effects , such as the limits of the intensity range extending into regions where the anomalous regime is breaking down , or the dielectric properties of the materials being modified by the concentration of mobile carriers .",
    "for this reason , it is unlikely that differences in these values of @xmath7 are significant .",
    "the experimental literature is consistent with the view that there could be a robust regime with an exponent close to the middle of the range @xmath33 , while different exponents may be observable in other systems .",
    ".summary of previously published anomalous exponents , @xmath7 . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are three outliers , where a single value of @xmath25 is quoted which is not in the range @xmath33 .",
    "wronski and daniel show results which are consistent with @xmath34 over a range of temperatures . rose ( 1963 ) reports that vidicon camera tubes ( which used @xmath35 ) give @xmath36 over several decades. this value is sufficiently far from the other exponents that it might have a different origin . also arene and baixeras ( 1984 )",
    "show a plot with @xmath37 over nearly four decades . in this case",
    ", the exponent is so close to the bimolecular case @xmath4 that it is questionable whether this is an anomalous response .",
    "the theory presented by rose ( 1963 ) predicts that @xmath7 has the following dependence upon the temperature @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an effective temperature characterising the exponential density of states in the band gap .",
    "a more recent paper developing this approach is schellenberg and kao ( 1988 ) .",
    "wronski and daniel ( 1981 ) examined the intensity dependence of the photocurrent in hydrogenated amorphous silicon at a variety off temperatures ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "figure 5 of their paper demonstrates that the exponent @xmath25 is close to @xmath43 and independent of @xmath38 at lower intensities , crossing over to @xmath44 at higher intensity .",
    "their data are , therefore , incompatible with ( [ eq : 2.1 ] ) .    there are some published results which contradict the evidence in wronski and daniel ( 1981 ) , but these works do not present a coherent picture .",
    "papers by spear _",
    "et al _ ( 1974 ) , kaplan and kaplan ( 1998 ) and bakr ( 2002 ) report that @xmath25 does depend upon temperature , but their exponents vary erratically and do not show agreement with ( [ eq : 2.1 ] ) . it is not clear how the intensity dependence of the exponents obtained by spear _ et al _ were extracted from the experimental data .    in table",
    "[ tab : 1 ] i have not included reports ( such as bube , 1957 , bube and lind , 1958 ) where anomalous photoconductive response was observed but where the samples displayed non - ohmic behaviour .      in discussing the earlier experimental work i have pointed out that much of the the published experimental data are consistent with a previously un - remarked universality , where @xmath45 . some of the other literature suggests , however , that the values of the anamalous exponent are highly variable and may be erratic and hard to reproduce . by definition , universal behaviour",
    "does not shy away from observation .",
    "it might be observable in a simple experiment with a generic semiconductor sample . with this motivation",
    ", i measured the response of four different commercially available light - dependent resistors at room temperature ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the photocells , samples 1 - 4 , were obtained from maplin electronics .",
    "their catalogue numbers were : sample 1 - n56ay , sample 2 - n57ay , sample 3 - n53ay , sample 4 - n46ay .",
    "the specifications do not include the composition of the sensitive semiconductor layer , but that is not relevant to the question of whether the anamolous exponent is universal .",
    "the intensity of light from a tungsten bulb was reduced by stopping down the aperture of a light box , and by increasing the distance between the aperture and the photocell .",
    "some of the higher intensity data used an unshielded @xmath47 bulb , varying the distance from the sample .",
    "the response of each photocell was found to be ohmic for both low and high light intensities , and its dark current was negligible .",

    "figure [ fig : 1 ] shows logarithmic plots of conductance @xmath23 ( in units of @xmath49 ) versus intensity @xmath1 .",
    "the light intensity scale is in arbitrary units , chosen so that the @xmath47 pearlescent bulb at @xmath50 gave an intensity @xmath51 . for each sample",
    "there was clear evidence for an anomalous regime .",

    "three out of four samples showed anomalous behaviour with @xmath5 , providing strong support for the hypothesis that this is a universal phenomenon .",
    "it is noteworthy that the other sample produced an exponent very close to that reported by rose ( 1963 ) for the vidicon camera .",

    "my own experiments and much of the previously published work is consistent the view the there are three different regimes which can be observed in different systems , or over different ranges of intensity within the same system . in the order where they might be expected to be observed as the light intensity is increased , these are :    1 .   _",
    "monomolecular regime_. here @xmath3 , which is consistent with carriers being trapped on a fixed number of recombination centres . in the low - intensity limit",
    "it is expected that a carrier will always encounter such a trap before encountering a carrier with the opposite sign .",
    "2 .   _ anomalous regime_. the origin of this will be considered below . in cases",
    "where a crossover has been observed as intensity is varied , this regime appears to occur in between the monomolecular and bimolecular regimes .",
    "bimolecular regime_. here @xmath4 , which is consistent with carriers being removed by electron - hole recombination at a rate proprtional to the product of the electron and hole concentrations .    as the terms _ monomolecular _ and _ bimolecular _ suggest , the exponents @xmath3 and @xmath4 are both explained by invoking the law of mass action , as outined in the introduction . the law of mass action is applicable in situations where the reactive species move randomly by diffusion , without any interaction occurring until they are in contact .",
    "this idealisation is realistic for chemical reactions in which there is no electrostatic interaction",
    ". it may also be valid when the species are charged but when the rate constant for the chemical reaction is small , so the species reach a local quasi - equilibrium .    in the case of electron - hole recombination",
    ", there is coulombic attraction between electrons and holes .",
    "this can pull them together , so that the time required for a collisions to occur may be less than it would be for randomly diffusing particles .",
    "the effect of recombination events on the density @xmath15 may be written @xmath58 , where @xmath15 is the number of either species , and @xmath59 is the lifetime for an electron or hole to survive without collisions .",
    "the following discussion uses scaling arguments rather than detailed calculations of the electron dynamics , but these arguments are sufficient to make a precise determination of the anomalous exponent .",
    "if the collisions occur due to random diffusion of electrons and holes , then the lifetime @xmath59 will be inversely proportional to the density of the other species , so that @xmath60 . if the coulombic force is significant , the timescale for collision will be the time required for an electron and a hole to be pulled together by their mutual electrostatic attraction , and @xmath59 may have a different dependence upon the carrier density , @xmath15 . in this case",
    "@xmath59 is expected to be proportional to the characteristic distance @xmath61 that an electron and a hole have to travel in order to make a collision .",
    "the timescale is also inversely proportional to the characteristic velocity @xmath27 for relative motion of the electrons and the holes : @xmath62 . if the density of carriers is @xmath15 , we clearly have @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the effective spatial dimension of the photosensitive region penetrated by the radiation .",
    "( that is , we set @xmath65 , unless the depth is small compared to @xmath61 , when we would use @xmath66 )",
    ". the velocity @xmath27 will depend upon the local electric field @xmath28 driving the drift towards collision .",
    "the charges @xmath67 of the electrons and holes are independent of the density , but the lengthscale @xmath61 depends upon the carrier density so that @xmath68 .    in order to determine how @xmath59 depends upon @xmath15 , it remains to specify how the typical drift velocity @xmath27 depends upon the electric field @xmath28 .",
    "there are two possibilities :    1 .   at first sight",
    "it seems natural to invoke linear response theory , and to propose that @xmath29 .",
    "it should , however , be noted that because the lengthscale @xmath61 is very small , the electric field @xmath28 will be very large .",
    "for example , the electric field due to an electron at a distance of @xmath69 is of order @xmath70 .",
    "these electric fields are so high that the applicability of linear response theory is questionable .",
    "it is argued that hot - carriers in semiconductors have a damping rate due to interaction with phonons which rises very steeply with energy ( ziman 1972 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the velocity of mobile carriers in semiconductors becomes insensitive to the applied electric field , and may even appproach a limiting value as the electric field increases ( ferry 1975 , arora 1984 ) .",
    "these hot carrier effects are considered to be significant for electric fields in excess of @xmath71 .",
    "the physics underlying the hot carrier model will be discussed in greater detail below , after considering its consequences . in the following",
    "it will be assumed that the relation between carrier velocity and electric field may be described by a power - law , such that @xmath72 the linear response model corresponds to setting @xmath73 .",
    "the hot carrier model , where the velocity is quite insensitive to the microscopic electric field , is consistent with either assigning a very small value to @xmath31 , or else taking the limit as @xmath74 in the final result . before discussing the value of @xmath31 ,",
    "let us consider the formula for the anomalous exponent .",
    "we have a recombination rate of the form @xmath75 since the rate of recombination is proportional to the flux @xmath1 , we find @xmath76 with @xmath77 so that this theory is consistent with the photoconductivity having a power - law dependence upon @xmath1 with a non - trivial exponent .",
    "equation ( [ eq : 3.3 ] ) is the central theoretical result of this paper . in three dimensions",
    "the exponent takes the value @xmath78 for the first model considered above , where the drift velocity of the carriers is determined by linear response theory . in the second version of the model , where the hot - carrier theory is applied and the limit @xmath32",
    "is taken , the exponent is @xmath5 , which is consistent with most of the experimental results .",
    "for @xmath66 , the hot carrier model gives @xmath6 , which is consistent with the results for my own sample 3 , with the exponent quoted by rose ( 1963 ) for vidicon cameras , and with the mid - range for the results of bakr ( 2002 ) on @xmath79 films .",
    "it should be noted that while the non - linear hot - carrier effect influences the timescale for electron - hole combination , the response to the small externally applied field is determined by equation ( [ eq : 1.1 ] ) and is ohmic .",
    "other authors ( see schlangenotto , meader and gerlach , 1974 , hangleiter , 1993 ) have suggested that coulomb interactions can influence the rate of electron - hole recombination , but these works consider electron - hole correlations which will modify the constant @xmath20 in the mass - action formula for the collision rate , @xmath80 .",
    "their calculations are only relevant to the bi - molecular process .",
    "now consider the response of an electron or hole to the local electric field .",
    "note that because we consider the microscopic structure of the electric field on a scale of the separation of the carriers , the field is not screened by polarisation effects .",
    "the samples where the anomalous response is observed are usually amorphous or highly disordered microcrystalline systems .",
    "the following discussion will assume that the carriers and the phonons are moving in a highly disordered environment .",
    "the energy available from the electrostatic interaction potential is much higher than the thermal energy .",
    "the electrons and holes can therefore become hot carriers , because their energies relative to the band edge may be much higher than the thermal energy scale .",
    "studies of spectral hole - burning in disordered semiconductors ( hegarty and sturge , 1985 ) indicate that the motion of electrons and holes is strongly damped by the effects of phonons .",
    "because of the energy loss to phonons , the electrons and holes are expected to remain close to the bottom of the conduction band or to the top of the valence band , respectively , despite having energies which are higher than the thermal energy .",
    "the physics of hot - carrier transport is extremely complex , and in the following discussion issues such as valley degeneracy will be ignored .",
    "the objective is to give a motivation for assigning a small value to @xmath31 in ( [ eq : 3.1 ] ) , based on a reasonable but simplified model for the interaction of charge carriers and phonons .    the electric field",
    "@xmath28 will cause an electron ( or hole ) to accelerate to a velocity @xmath27 corresponding to an energy @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the effective mass of the carrier ( we assume that the electrons or holes remain close to bottom or top of their bands , where the particle dispersion relations are approximately parabolic and the phonon dispersion can be neglected ) .",
    "a particle with velocity @xmath27 will then gain energy from the electric field at a rate @xmath83 .",
    "this acceleration is opposed by the tendency of the motion of the charged particle to excite phonons : a particle with energy @xmath84 will dissipate energy to phonons at a rate which will be written @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a rate coefficient . the energy of a carrier accelerated by a constant electric field is therefore given by the solution of the energy balance equation @xmath87 the hot carrier picture asserts that rate coefficient @xmath86 increases very rapidly with energy @xmath84 .",
    "various arguments and calculations have been advanced to support this claim ( ziman 1972 , ferry 1975 , arora 1984 ) . in",
    "the following i present a simplified but plausible model , which yields @xmath88 .",
    "the loss of energy by an electron to the phonons can be seen as analogous to spontaneous emission from an atomic state , with the phonons playing a role analogous to the photons in electrodynamics .",
    "recall the expression for the rate @xmath89 of spontaneous emission from an atomic level with energy @xmath90 to a level with lower energy , @xmath91 : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the frequency of the photon which is emitted , and @xmath94 is the corresponding dipole matrix element ( @xmath95 is the speed of light and @xmath96 is the fine structure constant ) .",
    "this expression can be adapted to describe the spontaneous decay of electronic states by emission of phonons . for simplicity it will be assumed that the matrix elements @xmath94 for the electron - phonon coupling in the highly disordered envirnoment are random numbers , with statistics which are independent of the energies @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the rate of emission into any given state of lower energy is therefore proportional to @xmath97 , where @xmath98 .",
    "the number of available electronic states with energy below @xmath84 is @xmath99 . upon integrating over the lower energy , the rate coefficient scales as @xmath88 .",
    "the steady - state solution of equation ( [ eq : 3.4 ] ) is therefore @xmath100 , so that the terminal velocity is @xmath101 that is @xmath102 .",
    "this supports the assertion of the hot - carrier model , that the electron or hole drift velocity becomes highly insensitive to the electric field .",
    "some authors ( for example , ferry 1975 , arora 1984 ) have gone further , and have suggested that the drift velocity approaches an asymptote as the electric field increases .",
    "this corresponds to setting @xmath103 in ( [ eq : 3.3 ] ) .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the anomalous photoconductive response has been based upon arguments due to rose ( 1963 ) , which make a questionable assumption about the density of trapping states in the band gap .",
    "this theory predicts that the anomalous exponent @xmath7 is temperature dependent , in contradiction with experiments by wronski and daniel ( 1981 ) .",
    "this paper has proposed an alternative explanation of the anomalous response , based upon the idea that the kinetics of electron - hole recombination are driven by coulomb attraction .",
    "the recombination time is then determined by the distance carriers have to travel , and their velocity @xmath27 , which is assumed to have a power - law dependence upon the local electric field @xmath28 : @xmath104 .",
    "this leads to a simple expression for the anomalous exponent , equation ( [ eq : 3.3 ] ) . because the electric fields are extremely high it is not appropriate to use linear response theory . in the hot - carrier picture for transport at high electric fields ,",
    "the drift velocity has very weak dependence upon the electric field , which justifies setting @xmath103 in equation ( [ eq : 3.3 ] ) .",
    "this model leads to the prediction that the anomalous regime has universal exponents of @xmath5 ( three dimensions ) or @xmath6 ( for thin samples which are effectively two - dimensional ) . in support of this universality hypothesis ,",
    "i have pointed out that many of the reported values of @xmath7 for the anomalous regime are close to one or other of these numbers .",
