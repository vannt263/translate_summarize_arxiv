    "strongly correlated systems in low dimensions are among the most active areas in the condensed matter physics .",
    "these systems contain a large number of particles that interact strongly with each other and can not be understood in a single - particle picture .",
    "a paradigm of strongly correlated systems is the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite ( fqhe ) that occurs when a system of two - dimensional electrons partially fills one of the landau levels in a strong perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "since the kinetic energy is frozen in a partially - filled landau level , the electron - electron interaction is the only relevant term in the hamiltonian and leads to the emergence of non - perturbative ground - states with fractionalized charge  @xcite and anyonic , abelian and non - abelian  @xcite , statistics .    due to the non - perturbative nature of the fqhe",
    ", numerical methods have played a crucial role since the original work of laughlin  @xcite . in particular , exact diagonalization ( ed ) presented itself as a versatile and extremely powerful tool that unraveled many of the complexities of fqh systems  @xcite .",
    "the popularity and quick success of ed was due to the specific correlations of fqh systems that rapidly minimize the finite - size effects with increasing the number of particles in the simulation .",
    "highly accurate predictions of the system s properties in the thermodynamic limit could be obtained by considering systems as small as 10 particles  @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , the main bottleneck of ed calculations lies in the exponential explosion of the size of the many - body hilbert space as the number of particles grows .",
    "while for the simplest fqh fractions , such as the laughlin @xmath0 state  @xcite , admittedly all essential physical properties can be obtained in the systems attainable by ed , in the majority of other cases ed is not sufficient .",
    "this is particularly striking in case of spin degree of freedom , or su(4 ) internal symmetry if we consider fqhe in graphene  @xcite .",
    "however , similar constraints arise even in the spin - polarized case of the non - abelian read - rezayi sequence  @xcite , where electrons are believed to pair into @xmath2-body clusters . therefore",
    ", a non - abelian @xmath3-particle state at level @xmath4 is likely to have finite - size effects comparable to the laughlin - like state of @xmath5 particles .",
    "hence , to address the properties of the non - abelian ground - state it is desirable to consider systems at least @xmath4 times as large .",
    "it is therefore of essential importance to develop new numerical methods that can reach larger system sizes than ed .",
    "one such method is the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) , invented by white  @xcite in 1992 .",
    "dmrg has been quite successful over the last decade when it was applied to one - dimensional systems such as the heisenberg spin chains and the one - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "in essence , it is a variational method to get the ground state and the low - lying energy states of the system .",
    "the algorithm contains two main parts .",
    "one is called the infinite size algorithm which grows the system to a big size , and the other one is referred to as the finite - size algorithm , which makes the ground state converge . the only approximation in the dmrg method",
    "is the truncation of the hilbert space according to the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix for the subblock which is used to construct the large system .",
    "the more states are kept in the reduced density matrix , the higher the accuracy one can achieve in principle .",
    "it is generally believed that the entanglement entropy of a subregion often grows like the boundary area of the subregion  @xcite .",
    "a larger entanglement entropy , or larger correlation , means that one needs to keep more states to achieve a sufficient accuracy .",
    "the success of dmrg in the one - dimensional systems was ensured by the low entanglement between the two subregions which only have a point surface between two blocks .    on the other hand ,",
    "a fqh system is two - dimensional and thus the success of the dmrg method in fqhe is by no means obvious .",
    "however , in a landau gauge , the one - body orbitals are gaussian - localized and provide a mapping to an effective  one - dimensional \" chain with the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "this motivates an attempt to apply the dmrg to the fqhe system .",
    "the first such attempt was done for the periodic boundary conditions ( torus geometry ) by shibata _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , mostly considering compressible , stripe and bubble , phases in higher landau levels .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite developed a dmrg scheme for the ground state and excited states in the spherical geometry for larger systems at filling factors @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "hard - core interactions were also studied on thin cylinders in an unpublished work  @xcite , and for bosonic systems in ref .  .",
    "most recently , zhao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite developed an independent dmrg implementation that by far exceeds the previous attempts . in this study ,",
    "the maximal system size was @xmath6 for @xmath0 and @xmath7 for @xmath1 .",
    "the independent implementations  @xcite appear to differ significantly from each other in various aspects , in particular in the number of basis states that are kept , ranging from a few hundred in the torus geometry , up to @xmath8 states in ref .  .",
    "in this paper , we report on the systematic study of the fqhe system in the spherical and cylinder geometry based on our independent implementation of the dmrg method .",
    "we address the well - studied fqh systems at fillings @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the goal of providing a detailed benchmark of the dmrg algorithm and comparing it with the previous implementations .",
    "new physical results obtained with the current dmrg implementation will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we analyze the convergence of the @xmath9 haldane pseudopotential  @xcite hamiltonian on the sphere that is analytically known to yield the laughlin wavefunction as an exact zero - energy ground state . in the case of coulomb interaction ,",
    "we evaluate the ground state energy for @xmath0 and @xmath1 fillings corresponding to the laughlin  @xcite and moore - read  @xcite states .",
    "the ground - state energies per particle are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit using finite - size scaling techniques . in sec .",
    "iii , we draw some comparisons with the cylinder geometry , which is an alternative geometry for studying the fqhe that so far has scarcely been used  @xcite . the convergence for the @xmath9 hamiltonian is found to be significantly faster on the cylinder than on the sphere , suggesting that this boundary condition might be promising for further studies of the fqhe . discussion and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we study a model for spin - polarized electrons moving on the surface of a sphere , with a magnetic monopole @xmath10 placed in the center to generate a radially - symmetric magnetic field perpendicular to the surface  @xcite . in strong magnetic fields , electrons in general",
    "completely fill @xmath11 single particle landau levels which are considered to be  inert \" , and all dynamics comes from a partially - filled @xmath12th landau level .",
    "any two - body hamiltonian , projected to this @xmath12th landau level ( neglecting the excitations to higher landau levels ) , can be written in the usual second - quantized form , @xmath13 in the spherical geometry , quantum numbers @xmath14 s label the @xmath15-component of the angular momentum for particle @xmath16 which takes values : @xmath17 .",
    "the one - body orbitals are the monopole harmonics  @xcite @xmath18 which generalize the usual spherical harmonics obtained for @xmath19 .",
    "when we target a specific many - body state , we also need to adjust the flux @xmath10 to take into account the so - called shift that determines the total number of the available orbitals .",
    "this means that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a universal number that characterizes each many - body state , e.g. @xmath22 for the lauglin and moore - read state .",
    "because of rotational and translational invariance , any two - body interaction matrix element @xmath23 can be decomposed as  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the haldane pseudopotentials  @xcite and @xmath26 is the radius of the sphere in terms of the magnetic length @xmath27 .",
    "the first two terms in the above equation are the clebsch - gordan coefficients on the sphere .",
    "when symmetry is taken into account , at filling @xmath0 the lanzcos method can diagonalize the sparse hamiltonian matrix for up to 14 electrons , corresponding to the hilbert space dimension of @xmath28 .    as shown by haldane",
    "@xcite , the advantage of the pseudopotential formulation is that model wavefunctions can be defined as ground states of the truncated hamiltonians .",
    "for example , the laughlin wavefunction is obtained as an exact zero - energy ground state for the hard - core interaction with @xmath29 , with an excitation gap controlled by the magnitude of @xmath9 . from the computational point of view , @xmath9 hamiltonian is nearly as sparse as the full coulomb hamiltonian , but it serves as a universal reference to test the accuracy of the dmrg code for large systems because the ground - state energy is known to be exactly zero for any system size .",

    "[ conv1 ] we show the ground - state energy convergence for different system sizes as a function of the finite - size sweep number with the fixed number of states kept ( @xmath30 ) , or as a function of the number of kept states in the subsystem with a fixed sweep number . for a fixed number of kept states , the accuracy of the ground state energy decreases when we increase the system size .",
    "it means that more states for the larger systems need to be kept if the same accuracy is demanded . as shown in fig .",
    "[ conv1](b ) , increasing the number of kept states obviously helps the convergence although the energy drops very slowly when @xmath31 is large .",
    "however , for the largest system size with @xmath32 we tested in fig .",
    "[ conv1 ] , the ground - state energy drops to @xmath33 when just keeping 4000 states and after finishing 10 finite size sweeps .",
    "this energy is far below the gap between the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "we assume the ground state is close enough to the laughlin state in this case . to improve the accuracy",

    "this state is more fragile that the laughlin state and has a smaller gap by nearly an order of magnitude . to study the convergence , it is in principle possible to use the exact interaction that produces the moore - read state as a zero - energy ground state , but",
    "this is much more costly because it is a three - body interaction .",
    "the results for the coulomb interaction projected to @xmath40 landau level are shown in fig.[mrscal ] .",
    "the ground - state energies are obtained for up to 30 electrons by keeping at most 5000 states .",
    "the result for the largest system size presented in this plot was obtained within one week on a computer cluster with 12 cores and 144 g memory . with the same scaling techniques as in the @xmath0 case",

    "cylinder geometry is interesting because it shares some features with the compact geometries , such as sphere or torus , but also possesses two open boundaries , which makes it convenient for the study of the edge effects , like the disk geometry  @xcite .",
    "compared to the sphere , the attractive feature of the cylinder is the flat surface and lack of curvature effects .",
    "cylinder boundary condition is compatible with the landau gauge where periodic boundary condition in assumed along one direction ( say @xmath42-axis ) with a repeat distance @xmath43 , and open boundary condition in the other direction ( @xmath44-axis ) .",

    "the orbital index @xmath47 takes values @xmath48 , and the distance in @xmath44-direction between two nearest orbitals is @xmath49 .    for a finite size system with @xmath3 particles at filling @xmath50 for example",

    "we focus on the liquid state and obtain it by dmrg method for large systems up to 20 electrons with the hard - core interaction .",

    "dmrg calculation is performed by keeping 3000 states and finishing 6 finite size sweeps.,width=302 ]    to verify that the ground state is indeed the laughlin state , we plot the average occupation number @xmath61 for the system with 20 electrons in 58 orbitals in fig .

    "the dmrg results for the ground state energies at filling @xmath0 and @xmath1 are consistent with the exact diagonalization study for small system sizes , and the previous dmrg studies  @xcite for large system sizes . for the largest system size we have reached",
    ", the error of the ground state energy is about @xmath33 which is roughly two - three orders of magnitude below the energy gap to the excited states . the consistency in the extrapolation of the ground - state energy shows that these system sizes have negligible curvature effects .",

    "based on the convergence for the @xmath9 interaction , we expect the cylinder to be the more promising venue for the future applications of dmrg .",
    "due to the presence of two open edges , the treatment of the full coulomb interaction is not as straightforward as in the compact spherical geometry , and requires special care in defining the confining potential to contain the fluid .",
    "one may furthermore expect various phase transitions as a function of the aspect ratio and the magnitude of the confining potential relative to @xmath63 .",
