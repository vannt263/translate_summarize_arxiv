    "in summary , we have studied the diagonal quadrupole modes and the scissors modes of two - component becs , and the nonlinear dynamics associated with the second harmonic generation of the quadrupole and scissors modes . within the tf approximation and quadratic polynomial ansatz for the density fluctuation , the linear analysis leads to analytical expressions for the collective - mode frequencies .",

    "we have confined ourselves to the condensates with their density profiles completely overlapping .",

    "although the scattering lengths of the mixture in jila satisfy the overlapping condition , the resulting double condensates do not form the inverted parabolic density profile .",
    "the latter two mixtures lie slightly in the phase - separated region .",
    "moreover , a mixture of @xmath220k and @xmath215rb becs also lies deeply in a phase - separate region @xcite . by changing the scattering lengths via the feshbach resonance , however ,",
    "we can , in principle , prepare the condensates in an overlapping regime and verify our prediction @xcite .",
