    "in this paper we want to discuss some general and technical aspects of calculating non - perturbatively renormalization factors of bilinear quark operators by imposing renormalization conditions on off - shell quark green s functions on the lattice @xcite .",
    "this method offers the possibility of computing non - perturbative contributions and all orders of @xmath4 perturbation theory in a simple way in contrast to the enormous efforts to get only lower orders with perturbative methods .",
    "the disadvantages of this numerical renormalization are the need of computer power and at present the systematic uncertainties due to a quenched approximation ( that excludes fermion loops ) , discretization errors @xcite and gauge fixing .",
