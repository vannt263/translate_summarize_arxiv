    "let us consider the motion of a test particle of mass @xmath3 and charge @xmath4 in an electromagnetic field @xmath5 in minkowski spacetime with inertial coordinates @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 throughout this paper .",
    "this equation can be written as @xmath9.\\ ] ] it is evident from this relation  as a result of the appearance of @xmath10 as a factor on its right - hand side  that as @xmath11 , it becomes very difficult to change the velocity of the test particle ; that is , either the field should be maintained over a long integration time or the external electromagnetic field must become exceedingly strong .",
    "otherwise , charged particles with @xmath12 extremely close to unity simply behave as essentially free particles and travel along a straight line .",
    "this may be interpreted in terms of the energy of the ultrarelativistic particle , i.e. @xmath13 . for @xmath14 , the particle has enormous energy and any significant change in its velocity produces a significant change in the energy of the particle ; therefore , unless an interaction with enormous energy is involved , the particle can be considered to be essentially free .",
    "moreover , in the limit of a massless particle such that @xmath15 remains finite as @xmath16 , the particle simply follows a straight line at the speed of light , as expected .",
    "this situation should be contrasted with the well - known phenomenon of bending of a light ray in a gravitational field ; therefore , the analogue of equation   must be fundamentally different for the gravitational interaction .",
    "in fact , we will demonstrate that the analogue of the @xmath17 factor is absent in the gravitational case",
    ". for one - dimensional motion along a straight line , reduces to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the component of the electric field along the direction of motion of the particle .",
    "the relevant factor in this case is @xmath20 ; again , we will show that such a factor is remarkably absent in the gravitational case .",
    "consider now the corresponding situation in a gravitational field .",
    "the analogue of equation is the geodesic deviation equation . to express this equation in a form that can be compared with",
    ", we must establish a fermi coordinate system about one of the geodesics  @xcite . in the curved spacetime of general relativity ,",
    "such a coordinate patch is the closest analogue of the global inertial system employed in equation .",

    "it is important to recognize that the reference geodesic remains fixed throughout our analysis .",
    "this approach to the deviation equation should be distinguished from the traditional one based on the jacobi equation , which involves a certain linearization about the reference geodesic .",
    "rather , we simply solve the geodesic equation in a fermi normal coordinate system established along the reference geodesic .",
    "let us note that equations ",

    "moreover , it follows from equation that in the gravitational case , the analogue of the electromagnetic particle energy equation takes the form @xmath58 so that unlike the electrodynamic case , the rate of variation of particle energy is in fact proportional to the energy of the particle . for one - dimensional relative motion in the @xmath59 direction with @xmath60 , equation   reduces to @xmath61 where @xmath62 . equation   should be compared and contrasted with equation  . neglecting higher - order terms in  , we note the existence of a critical speed @xmath63 in the gravitational case .",
    "the physics of this critical speed has been discussed in our previous work @xcite ; indeed , the existence of the critical speed is basically due to the fact that the motion of @xmath23 is expressed with respect to the fermi coordinate time @xmath28 , which reduces to the proper time of the reference observer @xmath22 along its worldline .",

    "this singular behavior signals the breakdown of the test particle approach adopted in our treatment , where higher - order tidal terms are perforce ignored .",
    "these issues will be illustrated in the next section in the context of the simplest gravitational field of astrophysical interest , namely , the exterior schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "it turns out that the results are observationally significant only near gravitationally collapsed configurations .",
    "imagine a swarm of relativistic particles around a point @xmath0 in the exterior schwarzschild spacetime that corresponds to the gravitational field of a mass @xmath1 embedded in an otherwise flat spacetime with asymptotically inertial coordinates @xmath72 .",
    "let the radial line joining the center of the spherical symmetry to @xmath0 be the @xmath73 axis . then in terms of the corresponding spherical polar coordinates @xmath74 , the schwarzschild metric is @xmath75    it is convenient to refer the motion of the particles in the swarm to an observer @xmath22 that starts from @xmath0 at @xmath76 and moves relatively slowly along the radial @xmath73 direction reaching infinity with a speed that is very small compared to unity .",
    "our results turn out to be essentially independent of such a speed ; therefore , we set it equal to zero for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the geodesic path of @xmath22 is thus given by @xmath77 we then set up a fermi coordinate system @xmath78 about the worldline of @xmath22 such that @xmath79 is along the radial direction .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath80 coordinates we choose @xmath81 there is then a rotational degeneracy in the choice of @xmath82 and @xmath83 ; once these vectors are chosen at a given instant of time , they are then parallel transported along the worldline .",
    "the nonzero components of the riemann tensor along the path of @xmath22 are given by @xmath84 except for the symmetries of the riemann tensor .",

    "the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to the fermi time @xmath28 ; moreover , we have limited our attention to terms given explicitly in equations  . equations   and   can be put in dimensionless form if all spatial and temporal durations are expressed in units of @xmath91 .",
    "there is therefore a simple scaling law at work here for different mass scales ( for instance , microquasars @xmath92 quasars ) .",
    "our results are most important very near the source , since the tidal forces decrease as @xmath93 away from the source .    to simplify matters , we take advantage of the axial symmetry of this system about the @xmath94 direction and set @xmath95 for all @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting system can be integrated with the initial conditions that at @xmath64 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the inclination angle and @xmath99 is the initial speed @xmath100 such that @xmath101 , see fig .  [ fig:0 ] .",
    "for the motion of a free test particle @xmath23 along the ( radial ) @xmath94 direction , @xmath102 , the equations of motion   reduce to the nonlinear equation @xmath103 the main aspects of nonlinearity here that are significant for our discussion are the existence of critical solutions involving uniform motion at @xmath104 and the effective change in the sign of curvature @xmath85 for @xmath105 . for initially ultrarelativistic motion ( i.e. @xmath106 ) , the particle decelerates toward the terminal speed @xmath107 as demonstrated in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the details of the deceleration process depend upon @xmath108",
    ". however , it is important to point out a _ general feature _ of the tidal deceleration mechanism in the particular case under consideration in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] : the particle starts at @xmath64 with @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 and decelerates to @xmath112 during a time @xmath113 _ regardless _ of the initial @xmath114 .",
    "thus , for @xmath115 , `` infinite '' deceleration can occur in a relatively short period of time ; however , in this limiting case the test particle approximation breaks down .    on the other hand , for motion along the @xmath59 direction , @xmath116 , the equations of motion reduce to an equation similar to , @xmath117 except that an initially ultrarelativistic particle accelerates along directions normal to the jet direction as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . as before , the particle starts at @xmath118 with @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 ; the integration ends at @xmath122 when @xmath123 .",
    "we note that @xmath124 may occur outside the domain of validity of fermi coordinates ; however , as @xmath125 , @xmath126 tends to zero and one might expect that in this case the influence of the higher - order terms may be small .",
    "it is in fact possible to show that in this limit @xmath124 approaches zero as @xmath127 .",
    "this is demonstrated in appendix a. it is necessary to remark here that for sufficiently large @xmath128 , the influence of the particle on the background geometry can no longer be neglected and hence our treatment becomes invalid .    to discuss the physics of the tidal acceleration / deceleration phenomena , it is useful to have an invariant measure of the energy of the test particle @xmath23",
    ". let us therefore introduce a class of static observers with four - velocity @xmath129 in the fermi coordinate system such that in the @xmath130 coordinates @xmath131 these fundamental observers associated with fermi coordinates are in general accelerated ; of course , one exception is the reference geodesic @xmath22 that is at rest at the spatial origin of the fermi system . at",

    "therefore , employing the invariant @xmath136 instead of @xmath139 would simply enhance these main results of the present section .",
    "the integration of equations   in the @xmath140 plane shows that deceleration is maximum at @xmath141 and monotonically decreases with decreasing inclination until about @xmath142 as demonstrated in fig .",

    "[ fig:4 ] , until about @xmath142 when it turns into deceleration .",
    "this circumstance can be illustrated by means of the critical velocity cone in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] : a particle with velocity within the cone decelerates relative to @xmath22 , while a particle with velocity outside the cone accelerates relative to @xmath22 .    in this section ,",
    "we have studied the solutions of the geodesic equation limited to the lowest - order tidal terms in an appropriately chosen fermi coordinate patch .",
    "of course , the equations of general relativity can be expressed with respect to any admissible system of coordinates .",
    "we choose a quasi - inertial fermi normal coordinate system due to its correspondence with the analysis of observational data . inside the fermi coordinate patch , the geodesic equation is exact within the test particle approximation scheme .",
    "thus the particle velocity @xmath144 can take any value consistent with the equation of motion   and the timelike condition  , see  @xcite .",
    "the fermi coordinate system has been employed extensively in general relativity theory ; for instance , it is used in  @xcite to discuss the local bending of light in a gravitational field .",
    "the robustness of our numerical results should be emphasized .",
    "in fact , our results do not change appreciably if instead of @xmath145 , the initial position of the test particle is chosen reasonably close to the reference observer",
    ". moreover , the reference observer can be any relatively slow - moving test particle on a radial escape trajectory  @xcite .",
    "[ sec:3 ] this section is devoted to the singular phenomenon of tidal acceleration of particles to the local speed of light within the fermi coordinate system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "this singularity comes about due to the nonlinear character of equation : for @xmath146 , the nonlinear factor @xmath147 changes sign thereby leading to tidal acceleration . as @xmath128 increases",

    "these plots turn out to be indistinguishable from figure  [ fig:2 ] , since the contribution of the second - order tidal terms is very small ; in fact , for @xmath164 , @xmath149 turns out to be 72.14 for @xmath139 and @xmath136 compared with 72.12 in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "thus , the singularity in @xmath139 is moderated by the presence of the higher - order terms .",
    "these results follow from the integration of equations that are not the actual geodesic equation ; indeed , the geodesic equation would contain the infinite set of higher - order tidal terms , whereas we have considered only the first and the second terms of this infinite set . though the influence of each higher - order term by itself may be small , as we have just demonstrated in the case of the second - order terms",
    ", we can not conclude that the same is necessarily true of the _ whole _ set .",
    "physically , however , our results indicate that _ with respect to the ambient medium _ around the central source , the free particles of the swarm can undergo significant but finite tidal accelerations and decelerations depending upon their directions of propagation",
    ". the observational aspects of these results are discussed in the following section .",
    "in our work on the acceleration / deceleration phenomena , we have adopted an approach based on _ relative _ motion within a quasi - inertial reference frame ( i.e.  a fermi normal coordinate system ) ; in fact , this treatment is generally consistent with the analysis of observational data . moreover ,",
    "we have concentrated on geodesic , that is , force - free , flow for the swarm of particles .",
    "we have neglected plasma effects in this paper for the sake of simplicity ; however , a more thorough investigation should certainly take these into account  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the comparison of our theoretical results with observation , the astrophysical environment around the central source should play an important role .",
    "it should be emphasized that the acceleration / deceleration phenomena that we have discussed occur within the fermi coordinate system and are thus measurable relative to the ambient medium surrounding the central source .",
    "let us note that at @xmath160 and @xmath165 , where the worldlines of @xmath22 and @xmath23 intersect , @xmath166 these invariants can also be computed in the background schwarzschild coordinate system and we find after a straightforward calculation that @xmath167 where @xmath168 and @xmath169 are respectively the energy and orbital angular momentum per unit mass of the particle @xmath23 as determined by the static inertial observers at infinity in the exterior schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "in fact , @xmath170 and @xmath169 are constants along the geodesic orbit of @xmath23 .",
    "thus if this geodesic orbit actually escapes to spatial infinity ( @xmath171 ) , it would not appear to have any remarkable features as determined by the asymptotically static inertial observers ; for example , for the accelerating particle discussed in section  [ sec:3 ] , @xmath172 and @xmath173 since @xmath116 .",
    "on the other hand , if the motion of @xmath23 is referred to the ambient medium surrounding the central source , the acceleration / deceleration phenomena that we have discussed can be measured .",
    "this is the key point : the gain or loss of gravitational tidal energy is measurable _ relative to the ambient medium_. in fact , the interaction of ( charged ) particles in the swarm with the ambient medium can lead to the radiation of tidal energy to distant observers .",
    "for instance , the collisions of such accelerated particles with those of the ambient medium can transfer their tidal energies to the latter particles that could then escape from the system and appear far away as highly energetic cosmic rays .",
    "the acceleration phenomena are consistent with the recent observations  by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observatory  @xcite  of accelerated motion normal to the jet directions in four neutron stars in our galaxy : crab pulsar , vela pulsar , psr b1509 - 58 and snr g54.1 + 0.3 . a detailed analysis of the recent crab nebula x - ray data is contained in  @xcite .",
    "the deceleration phenomena are consistent with observations of the speed of the plasma clumps in microquasar jets  @xcite .",
    "our theoretical assumptions rely upon the analysis of such observations based on the detection of relative motion using the standard flat geometry of an inertial system of coordinates . indeed , the acceleration of particles normal to the jet direction is measured relative to the fixed central features associated with the jets near the source  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the motion of a clump within a jet is measured relative to certain  fixed \" features of the ambient medium  @xcite .    what is the source of energy for the gravitational acceleration of particles ?",
    "while a local description of gravitational energy is not possible in accordance with einstein s principle of equivalence , we must nevertheless account for the energy of the swarm of particles as measured by the ambient medium around the source .",
    "ultrarelativistic particles moving away from the source within the critical velocity cone _",
    "lose _ energy and approach the critical speed regardless of their initial ultrarelativistic speed . on the other hand , ultrarelativistic particles moving outside the critical velocity cone _ gain _",
    "energy and accelerate as they move outward .",
    "we expect that there is essentially a balance between the energies that are lost and gained in the deceleration and acceleration processes , respectively .",
    "if the net energy that leaves the system is positive , one may speculate that the whole system of particles around the source would slightly shrink .",
    "such a contraction would lead to the release of gravitational energy that could account for the net loss of energy to the highly energetic particles that leave the system ; however , the detailed dynamics as well as the limitations of such processes is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the rotation of the central source has been neglected in this paper ; however , detailed studies have revealed that ",
    "other than specifying the jet directions  the influence of the rotation of the central source on our specific acceleration / deceleration results is rather small  @xcite .",
    "finally , we should mention that uhe cosmic rays of energy @xmath174 ev are not expected to reach the earth from extragalactic sources due to the gzk effect  @xcite .",

    "<S> imagine a swarm of free particles near a point @xmath0 outside a gravitating mass @xmath1 and a free reference particle at @xmath0 that is on a radial escape trajectory away from @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> relative to this reference particle and in a fermi normal coordinate system constructed along its worldline , the particles in the swarm that move along the radial direction and are ultrarelativistic ( that is , they have speeds above @xmath2 ) decelerate toward this terminal speed . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the swarm particles that are ultrarelativistic and move in directions normal to the radial ( jet ) directions accelerate to almost the speed of light by the gravitational tidal force of the mass @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of these effects as well as the influence of the higher - order terms on the tidal acceleration mechanism are investigated . the observational evidence in support of these general relativistic effects </S>",
    "<S> is briefly discussed . </S>"
