    "plasmonic nanostructures are at the heart of many research fields ranging from biological applications @xcite to quantum information processing @xcite . in recent years",
    "significant progress has been made in both the chemical preparation of noble - metal nanostructures @xcite and in simulation tools to model them @xcite .",
    "however , few attempts have been made to develop a comprehensive analytical model @xcite that could facilitate direct validation of experimental results and yield parameters that can guide the implementation of full electromagnetic simulations .",
    "most analytical approaches approximate maxwell s equations and are limited to specific geometries , like large gap separations @xcite .",
    "a promising alternative is to treat any nanoplasmonic system as a high frequency circuit composed of capacitors , inductors , and resistors @xcite .",
    "such a circuit model is extremely versatile as generalized equations for the resonance condition can be obtained , and their dependence on the geometry of the nanostructure understood explicitly .",
    "here we use this circuit approach to develop a simple analytical expression for two coupled plasmonic systems in close proximity .",
    "surprisingly this has been absent until now , despite its extreme utility , because a number of subtle effects need to be considered .",
    "our model is capable of describing both insulating and conductive gaps and applicable to arbitrary coupled plasmonic systems .",
    "we stress that such models are extremely useful to guide experiments , as electromagnetic simulation tools do not give direct insights ( like those shown here ) or scaling rules on the details of the nano - geometry . in the ultrasmall gap regime used here ( and of strong interest for experiments ) , we show these models are accurate enough to be highly effective .    in this work we first review the circuit model for single nanoparticles , and show how to effectively account for nanoparticle size .",
    "we then show the full model for coupled plasmonics components when the gap between them is insulating , and when the gap has a finite conductance .",
    "we then show the origin of the scaling in the resonance coupled wavelength arising from the inductance of the gap region , producing a simple estimate for the blueshifts observed .",
    "we start from the description of a single spherical nanoparticle , which is well characterized by an lc circuit that has been shown to be the exact solution to maxwell s equations .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite have determined the impedance contributions of the fringing field @xmath0 and the sphere @xmath1 with nanoparticle radius @xmath2 , frequency @xmath3 , gold permittivity @xmath4 , vacuum permittivity @xmath5 , and the capacitance due to the fringing field @xmath6 .",
    "the resonance wavelength can be determined by @xmath7 , which yields the well - known resonance condition in the electrostatic case for a plasmonic nanoparticle @xmath8 . here",
    ", throughout we use a drude model for the dielectric function of gold :    @xmath9    this yields the single particle resonance frequency , @xmath10 .",
    "the plasma frequency and wavelength ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively ) , and the background high frequency permittivity ( @xmath13 ) are material parameters which should not depend on nanoparticle size . however , electrodynamical effects , beyond the electrostatic approximation , lead to a weak particle size dependence of the resonance wavelength",
    ". there are several ways of correcting the resonance condition due to retardation @xcite , however , a relatively simple phenomenological way to account for this is to assume that @xmath13 depends slightly on the nanoparticle size .",
    "the resonance wavelength of different gold nanoparticle sizes in water ( permittivity @xmath14 ) from extinction spectroscopy ( fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) provides estimated values for @xmath15 using @xmath16 together with eq .",

    "to describe purely capacitive - coupled resonances a capacitor ( with capacitance @xmath17 ) can be placed between two equivalent single particle circuits mimicking the capacitive coupling , which reproduces the strongly red - shifted resonance @xcite . however , for either a conductive spacer@xcite or for very small gaps @xcite effects due to the increasing conductivity between the two systems have to be considered , with two results : first , the coupled bonding dimer plasmon mode ( bdp ) blue - shifts due to screening of the local field in the gap , forming the screened coupled mode ( sbdp ) . in this conductivity region the screening field reduces the voltage between the two elements .",
    "second , for higher conductivities a charge transfer mode , characterized by a net current between the two nanoparticles is formed @xcite . since both modes have different physical origins they have to be described by different equivalent circuits . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the screening of the coupled mode as this is directly accessible in our optical experiments .",
    "previously we considered the ratio of the screened charge to the charge stored on a capacitor without any conductive link @xcite .",
    "this simplified picture can be described by a resistor in series with the coupling capacitor effectively reducing the voltage at the capacitor . while this approach works well for describing relative changes of the charge stored on the capacitor per optical cycle it is not capable of predicting the absolute value of the resonance wavelength .",
    "therefore we use here an equivalent parallel circuit , which is composed of a capacitor shunted with a resistor and an inductor , which reproduces the behaviour of conductive paths through the gap , in series ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) ) . for a sufficiently low resistance",
    "the inductor produces a screening voltage , while for high resistance the inductor plays no role and the coupling is purely dominated by the capacitor . if the gap inductance is large , then little screening is obtained because charge can not short across the gap within an optical cycle .",
    "hence the fully screened mode at large conductance is blue - shifted furthest if the gap inductance approaches the inductance given by the individual sphere .",

    "for the case of very low conductivity ( @xmath26 ) which gives the typical coupled mode of the bonding dimer plasmon ( bdp ) this can be simplified to @xmath27 giving resonant wavelength    @xmath28    for coupled plasmonic particles . in the extreme case of high conductivity ( @xmath29 so @xmath30 ) , eq .",
