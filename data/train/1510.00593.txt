    "since the discovery of the current universe speed up @xcite , many attempts to explain the cause of this phenomenon have been proposed . among them , there are the @xmath0 theories of gravitation @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the @xmath0 theories is to replace the standard hilbert - einstein lagrangian density , i.e. @xmath3 , with a generic function of @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath0 . proceeding in this way the gravitational action becomes : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a coupling constant related to the gravitational constant @xmath6 and the speed of light @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath8 , @xmath9 the spacetime involved and @xmath10 the action of the part of the matter . in the last decade a lot of different functional forms of @xmath0 have been proposed in order to explain inflation , dark energy , dark matter and bario - leptogenesys @xcite .",
    "one of the most studied model is the starobinski one , i.e. @xmath11 , that we will use in this paper @xcite . in order to determine the dynamical equations in @xmath0 gravities , it is possible to vary eq .",
    "( [ actionmetric ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath12 .",
    "this procedure leads to fourth order field equations of the form @xcite : @xmath13 f'(r)= \\kappa \\,t_{\\mu\\nu}^{(m)}\\,,\\ ] ] where the prime , i.e. @xmath14 , denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath3 , and @xmath15 @xmath5 will be imposed equal to 1 hereafter , and we will express explicitly the einstein tensor @xmath16 in ( [ metf ] ) . in the following",
    "we will show two different parametrizations of the fields equations and of the resulting curvature stress - energy tensor .",
    "furthermore , we will denote under which conditions the two parametrizations give significantly different values for the curvature pressure and density .",
    "with the term of parametrization we want to denote the way to collect terms different from the einstein tensor , i.e. @xmath17 , in the left side of the fields equation ( [ metf ] ) . in principle",
    "we can organize them in a multitude of different ways , as will be clear hereafter .",
    "however , in this section , we present only two different schemes of parametrization for the field equations ( [ metf ] ) .",
    "these two schemes have been adopted in several articles , as can be seen when analysing the literature @xcite .",
    "the first parametrization , often used in literature by different authors as @xcite , writes field equations like denoted in the following : @xmath18 in order to obtain this form for the field equations , we divide both sides of ( [ metf ] ) for @xmath19 and we obtain : @xmath20 f'(r)=   \\,\\frac{t_{\\mu\\nu}^{(m)}}{f'(r)}\\,,\\ ] ] then adding and subtracting @xmath21 to the left hand side of the previous equation , we obtain : @xmath22 f'(r)=   \\,\\frac{t_{\\mu\\nu}^{(m)}}{f'(r)}\\,.\\ ] ] the curvature stress - energy tensor , responsible for curvature corrections , becomes : @xmath23 note that the semicolon , i.e. @xmath24 , stands for the covariant derivative .",
    "the @xmath25 in ( [ eq : curvstress ] ) represents a source for the entire stress - energy tensor and as it has been done in literature it permits to describe the universe dynamics @xcite .",
    "+ obviously , looking at eq .",
    "( [ field1 ] ) , the matter tensor is coupled to the ricci scalar by means of @xmath26 .",
    "hereafter we consider a standard friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker metric ( flrw ) , i.e. @xmath27 hence the corresponding modified friedmann equations obtained reading the @xmath2 and @xmath1 components of the field equations are @xcite : @xmath28\\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath29 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the matter density , i.e. the @xmath2 component of @xmath32 , and the matter pressure , i.e. the @xmath1 component of @xmath32 . in these equations",
    "we have posed equal to @xmath33 the scalar curvature , i.e. @xmath34 , in agreement with recent observations and we define the curvature density as @xcite : @xmath35 the curvature pressure as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is straightforwardly given by @xmath38 } { \\left [ f(r ) - r f'(r ) \\right ] /2 - 3 h \\dot{r } f''(r)}\\ , , \\label{eq : wcurv}\\ ] ] and it represents the equation of state ( eos ) parameter for the curvature part @xcite . the relation between the ricci scalar and the hubble rate , that will be used in the following , is @xmath39      in the second parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ metf ] ) , we rewrite , in order to be more explicit , the field equations ( [ metf ] ) : @xmath40 f'(r)=   \\,t_{\\mu\\nu}^{(m)}\\,,\\ ] ] and , instead of dividing both members for @xmath19 , we , at first , add and subtract the einstein tensor , @xmath16 i.e. @xmath41 so we get : @xmath42 f'(r ) + r_{\\mu \\nu}- \\frac{1}{2}g_{\\mu \\nu } r -r_{\\mu \\nu}+ \\frac{1}{2}g_{\\mu \\nu } r =   \\,t_{\\mu\\nu}^{(m)}\\,.\\ ] ] thus we can rewrite field equations like : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , i.e. the curvature stress - energy tensor , in this case becomes :    @xmath45 f'(r).\\ ] ]    proceeding as done so far , in this case we have obtained another parametization for the curvature stress - energy tensor , now denoted as @xmath44 , and consequentially new different expressions for the curvature pressure and density are : @xmath46 @xmath47 if we take @xmath2 component of ( [ field ] ) we get the first friedmann equation : @xmath48 and for the @xmath1 component we get : @xmath49 this parametrization is , for example , used in @xcite .",
    "in this section we introduce a new parameter useful to quantify the difference between the curvature stress - energy tensors in the two parametrizations . both sets of friedmann equations ,",
    "i.e. ( [ eq : fried1 ] , [ eq : fried2 ] ) and ( [ fr 1 ] , [ fr 2 ] ) , must obviously have the same solution for the hubble - rate , because they have been obtained starting from the same action and field equations ( [ actionmetric ] ) , ( [ metf ] ) . in the following we highlight different results for the components of the curvature tensor in the two different parametrizations , which from here onwards we call , for simplicity , system a and system b , in order of apparition in this paper .    at first",
    ", we highlight that in a the matter density is divided by @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath50 , thus a modification of the gravity , i.e. @xmath0 in the a system , generates an effective matter density that is reduced with respect to the real one .",
    "the same condition is realized for the pressure : @xmath51 .",
    "however the parameter of state for matter , i.e @xmath52 does not change , for the simplification of @xmath19 .",
    "because the hubble rate computed in a and b must be the same , we can find the relationship between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "equating ( [ eq : fried1 ] ) and ( [ fr 1 ] ) , ( [ eq : fried2 ] ) and ( [ fr 2 ] ) a simple computation gives : @xmath57 @xmath58 it is worthwhile to note that the second sides of both equations denote the difference between the effective matter density ( pressure ) in the system a and b. indeed @xmath31 is the pressure of the component of the universe in b , while @xmath59 is the effective pressure in a. now we calculate the relationship between @xmath60 and @xmath37 in the two systems .",
    "in order to perform this computation we rewrite previous relationships as : @xmath61 @xmath62 furthermore the parameter of state for dark fluid can be denoted as : @xmath63 with @xmath64 , which we name the deviation parameter .",
    "the previous one becomes : @xmath65 we have baptized @xmath66 the deviation parameter for his behaviour : for @xmath67 we obtain @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath66 is equal to zero if @xmath71 , i.e. the extended theory of gravity reduces to general relativity .",
    "@xmath66 is slightly different from zero if the @xmath0 analysed can be written as @xmath72 , with all non linear terms in @xmath3 small perturbations and sub dominant respect to the linear one , at a given cosmic time .",
    "if @xmath66 becomes big the components of two curvature stress - energy tensors , i.e. @xmath73 and @xmath74 , present a wider difference .    in order to be clearer",
    "we are going to exhibit some examples . thus adopting the hubble rate solution @xmath75 ( with @xmath76 cosmic time )",
    ", we itemize , in the following table , the different analytical values of @xmath60 and @xmath37 , computed for some @xmath0 models , i.e.    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     .",
    "in particular in figure [ fig2 ] we graph the behaviour of @xmath60 and @xmath37 for the widely studied @xmath77 .    , @xmath37 computed for the model @xmath78 , for the approximated solution @xmath79 in the range of @xmath80 $ ] . ]",
    "furthermore we introduce another meaning of the deviation parameter . from eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) we can see that the deviation parameter can be denoted as : @xmath81 and in this way @xmath66 quantifies how much the two different curvature densities in a and b differ from the background density ( e.g. matter density , radiation density ) .",
    "the same definition can be extended to the pressure .",
    "again , the @xmath66 parameter can be used to quantify how much a and b system give different results for curvature components , respect to the background .    as highlighted before , for @xmath82 or for small polynomial perturbations from einstein - hilbert action , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "however this condition is dependent by the time at which we are studying universe dynamics . in this way ,",
    "given a particular @xmath0 theory , chosen to describe gravitational force in the universe , can exist a time at which the non - linear terms become dominant and the @xmath66 parameter increase .",
    "consequently the two parametrizations for the curvature stress - energy tensors become widely different .    in order to better understand what we said we study the case of one of the most studied @xmath0 , i.e @xmath85 .",
    "this model could be a valid phenomenological candidate to explain dark energy , inflation , and other early universe phenomenon like leptogenesis @xcite . as known by friedmann equation ( [ eq : fried1 ] )",
    "the ricci scalar is a function of the cosmic time or equivalently of the redshift parameter @xmath86 .",
    "so if we consider @xmath87 there are values of @xmath3 ( and consequent values of cosmic time ) for which the @xmath66 function tends to be big .",
    "thus @xmath88 points in proximity of the hyperbole @xmath89 , with @xmath90 small , have a large @xmath66 , as shown in figure [ 1 ] . in proximity of these values of @xmath88 , components of two curvature stress - energy tensor give results widely different .",
    "consequently the effective interpretation of extra curvature components as a source tensor could be misleading .     for different values of @xmath3 and @xmath91 in the @xmath92 model .",
    "[ 1],title=\"fig : \" ] for different values of @xmath3 and @xmath91 in the @xmath92 model .",
    "[ 1],title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in this paper we have described two parametrizations of the curvature stress - energy tensor which emerge denoting the extra geometrical terms of curvature in field equations as a stress - energy tensor .",
    "these two parametrizations of the tensor have been denoted as @xmath44 and @xmath93 , and similarly it has been done for its respective component , i.e. pressure and density .",
    "we have described how it is possible to transform from one parametrization to another one ( and vice - versa ) by means of the introduction of the deviation parameter .",
    "the deviation parameter takes into account the emerging difference between the components of the two curvature stress - energy tensor . studying the behaviour of the deviation parameter we have argued under which conditions the two parametrizations for the tensor ( also denoted with a and b )",
    "give significantly different results for the curvature pressure and density .",
    "in particular we note that for small perturbation from the general relativity action the results of a and b systems are very similar and @xmath84 . while if the non linear terms of the action dominate , at a given cosmic time , the curvature stress - energy tensor give hugely differents results for curvature pressure and curvature density in a and b. in this case to denote the extra curvature components present in the field equations ( [ metf ] ) as a stress - energy tensor can be misleading , being the results for curvature pressure , curvature density and @xmath94 parameter depending from the parametrization chosen . in this case",
    "it could be better to treat the extra components as geometrical terms , which add contributes to the einstein tensor , i.e. @xmath95 .",
    "certainly these two parametrizations , described here , are only two example of a wider class of parametrizations that can be achieved . further studies about the different descriptions of the dark matter or dark energy phenomenon by means of curvature stress - energy tensor should be done .",
    "in this appendix we report some useful relations that we use to obtain the pressure and density from ( [ metf ] ) , i.e. field equations @xcite .",
    "the ricci @xmath2 component is given by : @xmath96 while the @xmath1 is @xmath97 the dalambertian opertor applied to the @xmath0 can be rewritten as : @xmath98 considering that the time and spatial component can be denoted as : @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101    the continuity equation is valid both for @xmath102 component and and for fluid @xmath103 .",
    "for each of them can be written the continuity equation : @xmath104 with solution @xmath105 with @xmath106 constant and @xmath107 .    for constant @xmath108 , in the universe phase",
    "considered , we obtain the following result for density : @xmath109",
