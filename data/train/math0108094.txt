    "in a recent work , ken brown   used algebraic methods to analyse random walks on a class of semigroups called `` left - regular bands '' . these walks include the hyperplane chamber walks of bidigare , hanlon , and rockmore  . in this paper , we look at the special case of reflection arrangements that arise in the study of coxeter groups .",
    "the random walks that we look at can be thought of as shuffles on the coxeter group .",
    "the motivating examples are the riffle shuffle and the random - to - top shuffle on a deck of @xmath5 cards .",
    "these correspond to the symmetric group @xmath0 , i.e. , the coxeter group of type @xmath1 .",
    "the only coxeter groups that we deal with are the ones of type @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "to make this paper accessible to readers unfamiliar with coxeter groups we have included two appendices .",
    "appendix  [ app : hyperplane ] reviews the facts we need about hyperplane arrangements . in appendix",
    "[ app : coxeter ] , we give a brief review of coxeter groups and then explain everything in concrete terms for the three cases mentioned above . for the general theory of coxeter groups ,",
    "we refer the reader to .",
    "let @xmath6 be the simplicial ( coxeter ) complex associated to a coxeter group @xmath7 .",
    "also let @xmath8 be the set of chambers ( or maximal simplices ) of @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath6 is a semigroup containing @xmath8 as an ideal . the product in @xmath6 is given by the projection maps as explained in appendix  [ app : hyperplane ] .",
    "we now describe the walk .",
    "let @xmath9 be a probability distribution on @xmath6 .",
    "if the walk is in chamber @xmath10 , then move to the chamber @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is chosen with probability @xmath13 .",
    "the product @xmath11 is again a chamber because @xmath8 is an ideal in @xmath6 .",
    "next we describe the walk more algebraically .",
    "fix a commutative ring @xmath14 and consider the semigroup algebra @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath14-module @xmath16 spanned by the chambers is an ideal in @xmath15 . in particular , it is a module over @xmath15 ; we therefore obtain a homomorphism @xmath17 the latter being the ring of @xmath14-endomorphisms of @xmath16 .",
    "this map is in fact an inclusion ; so we can regard elements of @xmath15 as operators on @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath18 be such that @xmath19 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the transition matrix of the random walk determined by  @xmath20 is simply the matrix of the operator `` left multiplication by  @xmath21 '' . in other words , it is the image of @xmath21 under the inclusion @xmath22 .    a way to analyse",
    "the random walk is to focus on @xmath15 and understand the structure of the subalgebra @xmath23 $ ] that @xmath21 generates in @xmath15 . because of the inclusion map above , we can also analyse the structure of @xmath23 $ ] in @xmath24 .",
    "we will make use of both viewpoints in our examples",
    ". the reader may be more familiar with this algebraic approach in the context of groups   rather than semigroups  .      in our examples ,",
    "the element @xmath21 will never be normalised .",
    "in other words , if we write @xmath18 then @xmath25 .",
    "so , strictly speaking , we will not have a probability distribution on @xmath6 .",
    "the main reason for doing this is to simplify the algebra .",
    "so everytime we describe the random walk associated to @xmath21 , the description will be correct upto a normalisation factor",
    ". this will also be true for all other objects that will show up in the analysis . to get rid of this anamoly",
    ", we adopt the following convention . if the random walk description says `` do xxx at random . ''",
    "then the normalisation factor is `` the number of ways of doing xxx '' . in general",
    ", the random walk description will involve a sequence of independent random acts in which case the normalisation factor will be the product of the individual factors . in most examples , we will prefer to first define all objects of interest as elements of @xmath15 and later to provide motivation by interpreting the associated random walks .",
    "making this translation will always involve the normalisation factor defined above .",
    "next we mention that in our examples , the element @xmath21 will always lie in the subalgebra of @xmath7-invariants of @xmath15 .",
    "we now discuss this subalgebra .",
    "the @xmath7-invariants of @xmath15 under the natural @xmath7-action form a @xmath14-algebra @xmath26 . as a @xmath14-module , @xmath26 is free with one basis element for each @xmath7-orbit in  @xmath6 , that basis element being the sum of the simplices in the orbit .",
    "since orbits correspond to types of simplices , we get a basis vector @xmath27 for each @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the set of simplices of type  @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the set of all labels or types of vertices of @xmath6 . also define @xmath32 to be the set of simplices of rank @xmath33 .",
    "as already mentioned , in our examples @xmath34 and hence @xmath23 $ ] is a certain commutative subalgebra of @xmath26 .",
    "since the element @xmath21 is always motivated by some shuffle considerations , we will call @xmath23 $ ] a shuffle algebra .",
    "bidigare proved that @xmath26 is anti - isomorphic to solomon s descent algebra  , which is a certain subalgebra of the group algebra @xmath35 .",
    "so shuffle algebras are anti - subalgebras of solomon s descent algebra .      in section  [ s : mt ]",
    "we define shuffle algebras and provide a semi - simplicity criterion for their analysis . in the next three sections , we give examples of shuffle algebras of type @xmath36 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "these sections should be read in conjunction with appendices  [ subs : a ] , [ subs : b ] and  [ subs : d ] respectively .",
    "our examples are motivated by shuffle considerations on the one hand and the geometry of the coxeter complex on the other .",
    "the striking similarity among the examples can be traced to maps among the three coxeter complexes .",
    "these maps which give a unified framework for our examples are explained in section  [ s : maps ] .",
    "this section gives us a good overall picture of how things fit together and can play an important role in the further development of the theory .",
    "we see an example of this in section  [ s : q ] , where we briefly discuss the generalisation of the random walks to buildings .",
    "this section is somewhat technical and it is better to read it lightly at present .",
    "you may want to go over the details later with a concrete example in mind .",
    "we first abstract the notion of a shuffle algebra and then develop the main tool for the analysis of these algebras .",
    "we first need a preliminary definition .",
    "an additive ( resp .",
    "multiplicative ) _ shuffle semigroup _ is a subsemigroup of the semigroup of non - negative ( resp .",
    "positive ) integers under addition ( resp .",
    "multiplication ) .",
    "note that there is only one additive shuffle semigroup upto isomorphism .",
    "however in the multiplicative case , there could be many .",
    "now we are ready to define a shuffle algebra .",
    "we say that a subalgebra @xmath37 is an additive ( resp .",
    "multiplicative ) _ shuffle algebra _ if it satisfies the following conditions :    1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath39 has a basis of the form @xmath40,@xmath41,@xmath42,  where @xmath43 is an element of @xmath44 , the span of simplices of rank @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath45\\subseteq k\\sigma$ ] .",
    "4 .   @xmath39 contains an additive ( resp .",
    "multiplicative ) shuffle semigroup @xmath46 as a spanning set .",
    "note that the definition of a shuffle algebra @xmath39 depends on the coxeter complex @xmath6 under consideration .",
    "in fact , conditions @xmath47 and @xmath48 say that @xmath39 is in tune with the geometry of @xmath6 . hence it is more correct to write a shuffle algebra as a pair @xmath49 .",
    "but we will not bother with this since in our examples the coxeter complex @xmath6 will always be clear from context .    an alternate way to express condition",
    "@xmath50 is to say that there exists an injective semigroup map @xmath51 such that the image spans @xmath39 . in all our examples , the semigroup @xmath46 will have an interpretation in terms of card shuffles .",
    "this explains our terminology .",
    "the above definition is mainly motivated by the infinite families @xmath36 and @xmath3 .",
    "the significance of this definition for the sporadic coxeter groups of type @xmath52 , @xmath53 , etc .",
    "is not clear .",
    "it is also natural to ask whether shuffle algebras can be classified .",
    "we do not know the answer .",
    "we would also like to point out that we have imposed the strictest possible conditions that our examples led us to . as a result ,",
    "some of the algebras we consider are not shuffle algebras ; for example , the shuffle double constructions in sections  [ subs : brs ] and  [ subs : drs ] . hence a more flexible definition might work better , say for the classification problem .",
    "ken brown   shows that if @xmath14 has characteristic 0 and @xmath21 is a non - negative integral linear combination in the canonical basis of @xmath15 consisting of all simplices then @xmath23 $ ] is _ split - semisimple _ , that is , @xmath23 { \\cong}k^n$ ] for @xmath54 . to guarantee this result for an arbitrary field he introduces an additional condition on @xmath41 . in all our examples , we assume that @xmath14 has characteristic 0 .",
    "also @xmath41 will always be a non - negative integral linear combination in the canonical basis of @xmath15 .",
    "hence it follows by condition @xmath48 that the shuffle algebras we consider are split - semisimple .",
    "we will not rely on brown s result however .",
    "instead we will use a semisimplicity criterion which we now state .",
    "[ p : ss ] let @xmath39 be an @xmath5-dim algebra containing a spanning semigroup @xmath46 .",
    "suppose that there exist characters @xmath55,",
    " ,@xmath56 of @xmath46 and elements @xmath57,  ,@xmath58 of @xmath39 such that for every @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 then @xmath61 with @xmath62 as the primitive idempotents .",
    "also the @xmath63 s extend to characters of @xmath39 .",
    "the elements @xmath57,  ,@xmath58 of @xmath39 span @xmath46 which in turn spans @xmath39 . since @xmath64 this implies that @xmath57,  ,@xmath58 form a basis for @xmath39 .",
    "this yields a vector space isomorphism @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "hence for @xmath59 , @xmath67 .",
    "since @xmath68 are characters of @xmath46 , we have @xmath69 for @xmath70 . the fact that @xmath71 respects the algebra structures on a spanning set @xmath46 of @xmath39 implies that it is in fact an algebra homomorphism .",
    "as mentioned before , this proposition will apply to all our examples .",
    "the algebra @xmath39 will be a shuffle algebra and @xmath46 the shuffle semigroup contained in @xmath39 .",
    "the characters @xmath72 of @xmath46 that we will use are @xmath73 if @xmath46 is additive and @xmath74 if @xmath46 is multiplicative . here",
    "@xmath75 is a fixed non - negative integer .",
    "the specific values of @xmath75 that we need to choose depend on the example at hand .",
    "the advantage of proposition  [ p : ss ] is that it is tailor - made for shuffle algebras and it gives an explicit isomorphism of @xmath39 with @xmath76 .",
    "the coxeter complexes @xmath6 of type @xmath36 and @xmath3 can be described using the language of `` ordered partitions '' .",
    "also , chambers of @xmath6 can be described as a `` deck of cards '' .",
    "this is explained in appendices  [ subs : a ] , [ subs : b ] and  [ subs : d ] respectively .",
    "we follow the convention that `` left to right '' for an ordered partition is `` top to bottom '' for a deck of cards .",
    "it is essential to understand this language before reading the examples .",
    "the side shuffle and riffle shuffle of type @xmath1 considered in sections  [ subs : ass ] and  [ subs : ars ] are the motivating examples of this paper .",
    "it is also a good idea to first understand these two basic examples before proceeding to the rest .",
    "we consider three examples ; the side shuffle , the two sided shuffle and the riffle shuffle .",
    "the first two are additive in nature while the third is multiplicative .",
    "the analysis for the first and third example parallels that of diaconis , fill and pitman   and bayer and diaconis   respectively .",
    "the difference is that we prefer to work with @xmath26 , which is the more geometric description of solomon s descent algebra .",
    "elements of the label set @xmath31 will be written as @xmath77 ; see figure 2.1 in appendix  [ subs : cd ] . recall that @xmath78 , the sum of simplices of type  @xmath30 , for @xmath79 form a basis for @xmath26 .",
    "hence these elements will play a key role in the analysis .",
    "this is more commonly known as the random - to - top shuffle or the tsetlin library .",
    "the element of interest is @xmath80 , that is , it is the sum of all vertices of type @xmath81 . in terms of ordered partitions , @xmath82 is the sum of all ordered two block partitions of @xmath83 $ ] such that the first block is a singleton . as explained in section  [ subs : rw ] , there is a random walk on a deck of @xmath5 cards associated to @xmath21 .",
    "it consists of removing a card at random and replacing it on top . when @xmath84 , for example , @xmath85 is a typical summand of @xmath21 .",
    "its product with the deck @xmath86,@xmath87,@xmath88,@xmath89 gives @xmath90,@xmath91,@xmath88,@xmath89 , that is , the overall effect is to remove the card labelled @xmath92 and put it on top .",
    "note that the normalisation factor in this case is @xmath5 , consistent with the convention of section  [ subs : ne ] .",
    "in addition to @xmath93 , we define @xmath94 where @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "to explain in words , @xmath41 is the sum of all the vertices of type @xmath81 , @xmath42 is the sum of all the edges of type @xmath97 and so on till @xmath98 which is the sum of all chambers of @xmath6 .",
    "as ordered partitions , @xmath99 is the sum of all ordered @xmath100 block partitions of @xmath83 $ ] such that the first @xmath33 blocks are singletons . also for convenience ,",
    "we define @xmath101 . just like @xmath41",
    ", we can describe the random walk on a deck of @xmath5 cards associated to @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath102 choose @xmath33 distinct cards at random and put them on top in a random order .",
    "note that @xmath103 was previously defined in an artificial way .",
    "but the random walk description for @xmath103 makes perfect sense and we now see the motivation in setting @xmath101 .",
    "the two are identical as random walks and by our convention have the same normalisation factor of @xmath104 . from now on , we will leave out the discussion on normalisation .",
    "we now present two methods to analyse @xmath105 $ ] .    *",
    "the shuffle method*.    put @xmath106 .",
    "define @xmath107-shuffles @xmath108 for @xmath109 by @xmath110 where @xmath111 are the stirling numbers of the second kind .",
    "they count the number of ways in which @xmath107 elements can be divided into @xmath33 non - empty subsets .",
    "we make the convention that @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "also @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "note that @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the motivation behind this definition will soon become clear .",
    "unlike for @xmath43 , the description of @xmath108 in terms of ordered partitions is not clear .",
    "however , the associated random walk on a deck of @xmath5 cards can be readily described .",
    "@xmath119 pick a card at random and mark it .",
    "repeat this process @xmath107 times .",
    "there is no restriction on the number of times a given card may get marked .",
    "move all the marked cards to the top in a random order .    to see the equivalence of the two definitions , note that @xmath108 can be expressed as a sum indexed by the number of distinct cards that get marked .",
    "suppose that @xmath33 distinct cards get marked . by our marking scheme for @xmath108",
    ", there are exactly @xmath111 ways in which the same set of @xmath33 cards gets marked .",
    "this leads to equation  . with the probabilistic interpretation for @xmath108",
    ", one can also convince oneself that @xmath120 .",
    "this relation was the main motivation behind the definition of @xmath108 .",
    "thus we get an additive shuffle semigroup @xmath121 contained in @xmath45 = k[s_1]$ ] .",
    "the additivity says that the semigroup @xmath46 spans @xmath39 .",
    "we can deduce from equation   that @xmath122,@xmath41,  ,@xmath98 lie in @xmath39 .",
    "also they span @xmath46 and hence @xmath39 .",
    "since we know that they are linearly independent in @xmath26 , it now follows that they form a basis for @xmath39 .",
    "hence @xmath39 is a shuffle algebra .",
    "the analysis so far shows that the element @xmath41 determines what @xmath123 should be , assuming that we want @xmath124 .",
    "we will see this more directly in the second method .",
    "now we show that @xmath125 .",
    "we do this by moulding equation   in the shape of equation  ( * ) of proposition  [ p : ss ] .",
    "the key step is to use the following explicit formula for the stirling numbers @xmath111 ; see  . @xmath126 with the convention that @xmath127 .",
    "substituting the above expression in the formula for @xmath108 and rearranging terms , we get for @xmath109 @xmath128 observe that @xmath129 because @xmath130 .",
    "the remaining @xmath62 s are clearly non - zero .",
    "now apply proposition  [ p : ss ] to @xmath46 and @xmath39 along with the @xmath5 characters of @xmath46 given by @xmath131 for @xmath132 .",
    "this gives @xmath133 .",
    "the isomorphism maps @xmath108 to @xmath134 .",
    "these give the possible set of eigenvalues of @xmath108 considered as an operator on any @xmath39-module .",
    "the formulas for the @xmath62 s are identical to those obtained in  .",
    "the minimal polynomial for @xmath108 is given by @xmath135 .",
    "if we expand this polynomial , substitute @xmath136 and use equation   then we get some identities involving the stirling numbers .",
    "* the direct method*.    we first claim that @xmath137 if @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "we see this from the description of the @xmath21 s as ordered partitions as follows .",
    "a typical summand of @xmath43 is @xmath86,@xmath87,@xmath140,@xmath141,@xmath142 .",
    "this term appears @xmath33 times in the product @xmath143 ; the @xmath33 summands of @xmath41 that contribute being the ones in which the element in the singleton block is one of @xmath144 .",
    "this yields @xmath145 .",
    "the remaining terms yield @xmath146 and the claim follows .",
    "for @xmath147 , the claim says that @xmath148 .",
    "thus @xmath149 is determined by @xmath41 and the same is true for @xmath150 and so on .",
    "more precisely , by induction we get @xmath151 this along with @xmath139 implies that both @xmath122,@xmath41,  ,@xmath98 and @xmath152,@xmath153,  ,@xmath154 form a basis for @xmath39 .",
    "the basic relation satisfied by @xmath41 is @xmath155 , that is , @xmath156 .",
    "hence @xmath157}{x(x-1)\\ldots(x - n+2)(x - n)}$ ] , where the map sends @xmath41 to @xmath158 .",
    "this shows that @xmath39 is split semisimple .",
    "note that this time we did not use proposition  [ p : ss ] to arrive at this conclusion .",
    "we now give algebraic motivation for equation   by rederiving it here . right now",
    "@xmath43 is defined only for @xmath159 .",
    "but we may extend the definition of @xmath43 to any @xmath33 using equation  . with this extension",
    ", one may check that @xmath101 and @xmath160 for @xmath161 .",
    "we now find a formula for @xmath162 by inverting equation   formally .",
    "write @xmath163 for some constants @xmath111 .",
    "multiply both sides on the right by @xmath41 and use the relation @xmath137 to obtain the recursion : @xmath164 with @xmath165 .",
    "the recursion and the initial conditions show that @xmath111 are the stirling numbers of the second kind .",
    "we now define the @xmath107-shuffle @xmath108 to be @xmath166 .",
    "this gives equation  . by our definition",
    ", it follows directly that @xmath120 .",
    "note that this time we did not rely on any probabilistic interpretation of @xmath108 to derive this additive relation .",
    "consider the map @xmath167 { \\twoheadrightarrow}a$ ] which sends @xmath158 to @xmath41 .",
    "along with @xmath168 , the other sequence which played a prominent role in our analysis was @xmath169 , where @xmath170 . both these sequences are polynomial sequences of binomial type  .",
    "this kind of structure seems to be common to all the additive examples .",
    "the first sequence is always the same but the second sequence varies .",
    "and the relation between the two gives us various analogues of the stirling numbers .",
    "it would be worthwhile to understand this better .",
    "it is possible to write down an explicit formula for @xmath171 .",
    "we state it here for completeness .",
    "@xmath172 there is also a @xmath4-analogue of the side shuffle which we will explain in section  [ s : q ] .",
    "this example is similar to the side shuffle and it will be useful to keep the analogy in mind .",
    "the element of interest is @xmath173 . in terms of ordered partitions , @xmath21 is the sum of all ordered two block partitions of @xmath83 $ ] such that either the first block or the second block is a singleton .",
    "the associated random walk on a deck of cards consists of removing a card at random and replacing it either on top or at the bottom ; whence the name .",
    "in addition to @xmath93 , we define @xmath174 , where @xmath175 for @xmath96 .",
    "note that @xmath176 is the union of the first @xmath14 and last @xmath177 elements of the label set .",
    "hence the cardinality of @xmath176 is always @xmath33 .",
    "also as ordered partitions , @xmath178 is the sum of all ordered @xmath100 block partitions of @xmath83 $ ] such that the first @xmath14 and the last @xmath177 blocks are singletons . as is evident from the formula , expressing @xmath43 in this language is not pleasant .",
    "however the probability description will be simple as we will see .",
    "also put @xmath106 and @xmath179 .",
    "now define @xmath107-shuffles @xmath108 for @xmath109 by @xmath180 where @xmath111 counts the number of ways in which a set of @xmath107 elements can be divided into @xmath33 non - empty subsets , where in each subset the elements are further divided into two subsets .",
    "we will call the @xmath111 s the _ signed _ stirling numbers .",
    "they satisfy the recursion : @xmath181 with @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "an explicit formula is as under : @xmath184 note that @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "these definitions are motivated by the following interpretations of the random walks associated to @xmath43 and @xmath108 .",

    "first check that @xmath179 .",
    "next note that @xmath43 can be expressed as a sum depending on the number of cards @xmath14 that are moved to the top .",
    "there are @xmath187 ways for this to occur .",
    "this leads us to the equation for @xmath43 in terms of the @xmath178 s that we wrote earlier .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath108 is slightly subtle . as for the side shuffle ,",
    "express @xmath108 as a sum indexed by the number of distinct cards that get marked .",
    "suppose that @xmath33 distinct cards get marked . by our marking scheme for @xmath108 ,",
    "there are exactly @xmath188 ways in which the same set of @xmath33 cards gets marked .",
    "this is because we use distinct labels @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "however , this extra factor is compensated in the next step where we use the last label on a marked card to decide whether it goes to the top or the bottom .",
    "now observe that @xmath120 .",
    "this gives us an additive shuffle semigroup @xmath121 contained in @xmath45 = k[s_1]$ ] .",

    "we order @xmath478 by inclusion .",

    "it is a lattice if the arrangement @xmath469 is _ central _ ,",
    "i.e. , if @xmath487 .",
    "indeed , this intersection is then the smallest element of  @xmath478 , and a finite upper semilattice with a smallest element is a lattice .",
    "the support map gives a surjection @xmath488 which preserves order and also behaves nicely with respect to the semigroup structure .",
    "namely , we have @xmath489 and @xmath490      let @xmath449 and @xmath491 be two hyperplane arrangements such that @xmath492 , that is , the arrangement @xmath493 is obtained from @xmath469 by deleting some of the hyperplanes .",
    "let @xmath494 and @xmath495 be the respective hyperplane face semigroups .",
    "then there is a natural map @xmath496 .",
    "an element of @xmath494 is a face @xmath344 with a sign sequence , say @xmath497 .",
    "we map it to the face of @xmath493 with the sign sequence @xmath498 . in other words , we forget the signs of the elements of @xmath31 that are not in @xmath499 .",
    "it is clear that this map is a semigroup homomorphism and preserves the face relation .",
    "the second fact is implied by the first in view of equation  .",
    "suppose now that @xmath469 is a _",
    "arrangement , i.e. , that the hyperplanes have a nonempty intersection .",
    "we may assume that this intersection contains the origin .",
    "suppose further that @xmath500 , in which case @xmath469 is said to be _",
    "essential_. ( there is no loss of generality in making this assumption ; for if it fails , then we can replace @xmath395 by the quotient space @xmath501 . ) the hyperplanes then induce a cell - decomposition of the unit sphere , the cells being the intersections with the sphere of the faces @xmath502 .",
    "thus @xmath470 , as a poset , can be identified with the poset of cells of a regular cell - complex @xmath6 , homeomorphic to a sphere .",
    "note that the face @xmath503 , which is the identity of the semigroup  @xmath470 , is not visible in the spherical picture ; it corresponds to the empty cell .",
    "the cell - complex @xmath6 plays a crucial role in  , to which we refer for more details .",
    "thus the cell - complex @xmath6 is a semigroup which we call the hyperplane face semigroup",

    "we work with an arbitrary finite coxeter group  @xmath7 and its associated hyperplane face semigroup @xmath6 ( the coxeter complex of  @xmath7 ) . but we will explain everything in concrete terms for the cases @xmath504 . this should make the discussion accessible to readers unfamiliar with coxeter groups .",
    "we begin with a very quick review of the basic facts that we need about finite coxeter groups and their associated simplicial complexes @xmath6 .",
    "details can be found in many places , such as .",

    "( as explained there , one might have to first pass to a quotient of  @xmath395 . )",
    "it turns out that the coxeter complex @xmath6 is always a simplicial complex .",
    "furthermore , the action of  @xmath7 on  @xmath395 induces an action of @xmath7 on  @xmath6 , and this action is simply - transitive on the chambers .",

    "the number @xmath509 of vertices of a chamber of @xmath6 is called the _ rank",
    "_ of @xmath6 ( and of @xmath7 ) ; thus the dimension of @xmath6 as a simplicial complex is @xmath510 . it is known that one can color the vertices of @xmath6 with @xmath509 colors in such a way that vertices connected by an edge have distinct colors .",
    "the color of a vertex is also called its _ label _ , or its _ type _ , and we denote by @xmath31 the set of all types .",
