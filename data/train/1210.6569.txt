    "there are two most important heat exchange processes known : _ thermal conductivity _ , associated with collective oscillations of atoms ( i.e. , phonons ) or electrons in solids including metals , or with convection in fluids or gases , and _ radiative heat transfer _ which is associated to the electromagnetic radiation produced by thermally agitated atoms , e.g. , the black body radiation . in this work we concentrate on the latter process which can be dominant when the bodies that exchange heat are separated by gaps ( empty or filled with a heterogeneous material that weakly conducts the heat ) .    as is known , thermal radiation results from fluctuations of charge and current density in matter .",
    "this phenomenon is governed by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite ( fdt ) that relates the mean - square fluctuations of a physical quantity to the dissipation associated with the dynamics of the same quantity .",
    "because in dielectrics the loss is represented by the imaginary part of the permittivity , which may be in turn related to the effective conductivity of the material , the fdt requires the volumetric current density within a dielectric or conducting body to fluctuate .",
    "the fdt constitutes the basis of the present day radiative heat transfer theories which deal with the fluctuating currents and treat them as the principal source of thermal radiation .",
    "such a picture places the radiative heat transfer calculations in the framework of classical electromagnetic theory based on the macroscopic maxwell equations .",
    "indeed , the well - known theory of radiative heat transfer through narrow vacuum gaps by polder and van hove@xcite belongs to this class .",
    "similar techniques have been recently developed for the cases when radiative heat transfer through micron and even submicron gaps is assisted with nanostructured metamaterials ( see , e.g. , in refs .  ) . in these approaches the fluctuating current density in the two neighboring media is first obtained from the fdt , following the methodology introduced by rytov.@xcite next , the electromagnetic field produced by the fluctuating currents is calculated , after which the mean value of the power flow ( poynting vector ) across the gap ( filled with the metamaterial ) is found either with the multiple reflection method,@xcite or with a more general transfer matrix approach.@xcite    historically , however , thermal agitation of fluctuating currents was first discovered by johnson@xcite in _ electric circuits _ and the theory of such thermal fluctuations was developed by nyquist@xcite using ideas which were natural for an engineer dealing with networks of lumped elements and transmission lines .",
    "although this theory was a precursor to the fdt , it is still in wide use in the theory of thermal noise at radio and microwave frequencies .",
    "the famous nyquist s result states that , in any linear passive two - pole ( i.e. , a single port device with an input represented by two electric contacts ) operating at a temperature @xmath0 the electric thermal fluctuations ( in other words , the thermal noise ) concentrated within a narrow frequency interval @xmath1 can be equivalently represented by the fluctuating electromotive force ( emf ) @xmath2 , with the mean - square of fluctuations = 4(,t)r(),nyquist_introwhere @xmath3 $ ] is planck s mean energy of a harmonic oscillator with @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the planck and boltzmann constants , respectively , and @xmath6 is the input resistance ( real part of the input impedance ) of the two - pole .",
    "the equivalent emf is then understood as connected in series with the two - pole , which can be now considered noiseless .",
    "the beauty of this result is in that _ no knowledge of the internal structure of the electric network is required , _ and that all the information is contained within just a single parameter : the real part of the frequency - dependent input impedance . in the terminology of fdt , the equivalent emf in nyquist s formula has the role of a generalized force , and the two - pole input impedance is related to the generalized susceptibility of the system . in other words , the nyquist formula can be obtained by a direct application of fdt to the electric circuit.@xcite note that the fluctuating current appears in this model only as a reaction to a finite number of _ lumped _ voltage sources .",
    "in contrast , in the thermal transfer theory based on the full - wave electromagnetic formulation through the fluctuating current density understood as a _ volume - distributed _ source , the internal structure of the interacting bodies _ has to _ be considered during most of the calculations .",
    "thus , a thermal transfer problem appears in this formulation as a problem with infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the final result , however , happens to be expressed in quantities that abstract away the internal structure , such as the reflection coefficients of material half - spaces in the theory of polder and van hove.@xcite this observation suggests that introducing the distributed fluctuating current can be avoided in many cases .",
    "for example , in this work we prove that in stratified media the input impedance concept and the original nyquist theory can be generalized and used not only in problems related to electric networks , but also in full - wave radiative heat transfer problems .",
    "this allows for a significant reduction in complexity of the analysis and makes the theory readily available for practical calculations .",
    "it has to be mentioned that an expression for the equivalent lumped emf of the thermal noise for the case of a lossy material half - space was first derived by rytov@xcite using an approach based on the fluctuating current density .",
    "this result constitutes the basis of the thermal noise theory of aperture antennas.@xcite rytov also worked on equivalent four - pole network representation of a hot material slab.@xcite why then these results have not been widely used in the heat transfer problems ?",
    "perhaps , it is because the concepts of input impedance and the equivalent circuit description for full - wave electromagnetic problems are largely unknown among theorists working in the field of radiative heat transfer . in applied electromagnetics ,",
    "however , it is well - known that stratified media can be very efficiently treated within the so - called vector transmission line theory@xcite ( vtlt ) which , in essence , assigns an equivalent transmission line network to every electromagnetic mode ( propagating or evanescent ) in the system .",
    "we would like to stress here that the vtlt is not an approximation : it is a direct consequence of the maxwell equations when modal expansion is applied to the electromagnetic field in layered structures .",
    "the vtlt allows also for a systematic treatment of uniaxial and bi - anisotropic media .    in this work",
    "we extend the vtlt in order to include the effect of the fluctuating current density within the layers .",
    "in contrast to a few numerical discrete - element models currently available from the literature ( e.g. , ref .  ) , the theory that we develop here is fully analytical .",
    "the generalized theory allows us to prove a complete equivalence between a volumetric multilayered structure and its circuit theory counterpart , which may be visualized as a chain of transmission line segments with equivalent fluctuating voltage sources connected at the ports .",
    "when concerned with the radiative heat transfer between the layers , we show that this equivalent network may be reduced to just a series connection of a number of voltage sources representing the fluctuating emfs and equivalent impedances ( each can be under different temperature ) , thus , recovering in this way the famous nyquist result , generalized here to the full - wave electromagnetic processes in stratified media .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the radiative heat transfer between the layers reduces in our theory to a number of equivalent circuit theory calculations , which are relatively simple and very similar to what is typically done when considering thermal noise in practical electric networks.@xcite",
    "in this section we establish a connection between the classic polder  van hove theory of radiative thermal transfer and its representation in terms of the input impedances of the material half - spaces .",
