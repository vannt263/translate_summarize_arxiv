    "an outstanding consequence of heating non - abelian gauge fields is the screening of static chromo - electric and -magnetic fields .",
    "electric ( debye ) screening is generated by non - zero matsubara modes both for abelian and non - abelian gauge fields and its value at leading order has been known since a long time .",
    "the dynamics of the non - abelian zero modes is quite complex @xcite and it leads , at least in the schwinger - dyson approach to the static magnetic gluon two - point function , to the generation of a magnetic screening mass @xcite .",
    "non - zero magnetic mass was obtained from all variants of the magnetic gap equation in the effective three - dimensional gauged higgs and also in pure gauge theories @xcite .",
    "the spectra of screening masses in the su(2 ) higgs model were also studied in lattice monte - carlo simulations by measuring various correlation functions of gauge invariant operators @xcite as well as the gauge boson propagator in fixed ( landau ) gauge @xcite .",
    "electric and magnetic screening are simultanously accessible to four - dimensional monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the magnetic mass obtained from the gauge boson propagator in landau - gauge is rather close to that obtained from the gap equation , while the gauge invariant gluonic correlation functions yield several times larger mass .",
    "a consistent interpretation of the situation emerging in the weakly coupled higgs+gauge model was suggested in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in the framework of the so - called constituent model , where the mass measured in fixed gauge correlators corresponds to the constituent magnetic gluon mass of the confined three - dimensional theory .",
    "the idea of the constituent gluon offers a natural effective degree of freedom , which dominates the static part of the free energy of the gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed in this context that the relation between gap equation and the resummation of the free energy has been recently discussed in @xcite for the scalar field theory .    for pure hot @xmath0 theory",
    "the situation is more complicated since for the physically interesting range of the temperature the value of the gauge coupling @xmath1 is close to unity and it is not clear whether the standard argument for dimensional reduction applies .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate how far the screening masses can be described by means of the technique of gap equations .",
    "since the hiearchy of scales @xmath2 fails to hold in pure @xmath0 theory for the temperature range of interest we should investigate a coupled set of gap equations for all the screened modes and determine the corresponding screening lengths simultanously .",
    "the most straightforward way to do this would be to derive gap equations in the full four - dimensional theory .",
    "however , it is not known how to generalize the by - now well - established three - dimensional gauge invariant resummation @xcite to four dimensions .",
    "there are gauge transformations which might mix static and non - static modes , therefore the resummation of the static modes only , which was suggested in @xcite violates gauge invariance .",
    "since screening masses are static quantities it is natural to calculate them in the framework of an effective three - dimensional theory which is , however , valid only up to scales @xmath3 .",
    "it was shown that the accuracy of the description of such theories is improved if in the action of the effective theory beside superrenormalizable operators one also takes into account higher dimensional and non - local operators @xcite . when deriving the gap equation in the framework of three - dimensional adjoint higgs model it is important to address the question whether the symmetric or the broken phase is the physical one . in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been argued that symmetric phase is the physical one , the study of the debye screening also suggests that the presence of the @xmath4 condensate is physically unfavourable , therefore in what follows we will assume no @xmath4 backround .",
    "in this paper we shall assume only the separation of the static and non - static scales in the pure @xmath0 gauge theory , that is we assume that @xmath5 . in this way we will be interested in the derivation and the solution of the coupled gap equations of the electric and magnetic static fields . to our best knowledge our paper represents the first attempt for this simple generalisation of the gap - equation approach , where till now electric and magnetic screening masses have been discussed separately .",
    "the closest to the spirit of our investigation is the analysis of the sensitivity of higher order corrections of the electric screening mass to the existence and the value of a magnetic screening scale by rebhan @xcite .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows : in section 2 we shall calculate screening masses from the local superrenormalizable effective theory ( i.e the adjoint higgs model ) of the hot @xmath0 gauge theory using a gauge - dependent resummation scheme ( namely , @xmath6-gauge ) . the temperature and gauge - parameter dependence of the results are discussed in detail .",
    "gauge invariant resummation schemes are used for the derivation of similar coupled gap - equations in section 3 . in section 4 we shall analyze the effect of higher dimensional and non - local operators in the gap equation . in section 5 detailed comparison with the results of earlier and",
    "the most recent numerical investigations will be presented together with our conclusions .",
    "this scheme for the evaluation of the magnetic mass was first suggested in @xcite and for the debye mass in @xcite . it was noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite that magnetic mass obtained in this scheme is gauge dependent and therefore can not be regarded as physically meaningfull . however , even in gauge invariant resummation schemes the value of the magnetic mass can not be defined unambigously , because it depends on the specific resummation scheme @xcite .",
    "therefore it seems interesting to calculate the magnetic mass in a gauge non - invariant scheme just to compare the amount of gauge dependence with the ambiguity of gauge invariant approaches .",
    "the three - dimensional effective lagrangian relevant for 1-loop calculations can be written with @xmath6 gauge fixing as & l=14f^a_ij f^a_ij+12((d_i a_0)^2+m_d^2 a_0^a a_0^a ) + + & 12 m_t^2 a^a_i a^a_i+(_i |c^a d_i c^a+ m_g^2 |c^a c^a)+ 12 ( _ i a_i)^2+l_ct , + & l_ct=12(m_d0 ^ 2-m_d^2)a_0^a a_0^a-12 m_t^2 a_i^a a_i^a- m_g^2 |c^a c^a + & & + & d_ia_0^a=_i a_0^a - g_3 f^abca_0^b a_i^c , + & f_ij^a=_i a_j^a-_j a_i^a+g_3f^abc a_i^ba_j^c .    here we have added and substracted a mass term for @xmath7 , @xmath4 and the ghost fields with their exact screening masses .",
    "@xmath8 is the tree - level ( from the point of view of the effective theory ) debye mass for @xmath4 , which was generated during the procedure of the dimensional reduction .",
    "the other parameter of the effective theory is the three - dimensional gauge coupling @xmath9 which appears in the definitions of the covariant derivatives and the field strength tensor . at 1-loop level",
    "one has @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the gauge coupling of the original theory .",
    "the propagators can be read from the quadratic part of the lagrangian and can be found in the appendix , where one also finds some details of the evaluation of the relevant feynman diagrams contributing to the different 2-point functions . it should be noticed when performing the resummation of the pure gauge sector with the unique mass term of mass @xmath13 the longitudinal and transverse gluons acquire different masses , which are , however related by @xmath14 ( @xmath13 is the transverse and @xmath15 is the longitudinal mass ) .",
    "it is also possible to perform the resummation by introducing independent masses for the longitudinal and transverse gluons , but then the corresponding gap equations will have only complex solutions",
    ". the gauge boson self - energy can be decomposed as _ ij(k)=(_ij - k_i k_jk^2 ) _",
    "t(k , m_t , m_d , m_g)+k_i k_jk^2 _ l(k , m_t , m_d , m_g ) . in the appendix",
    "we give the expression of @xmath16 in terms of a few fundamental three - dimensional loop - integrals .",
    "these integrals are easily evaluated and an explicit but very cumbersome functional form can be written for the longitudinal and transversal projections of the polarisation matrix .",
    "the self energy for @xmath4 was first calculated in @xcite : & _ 00(k , m_d , m_t)=m^2_d0+g^2 n4 .",
    "[ reb ]    2truecm    the on - shell gap equations now can be written as @xmath17 on the mass - shell @xmath18 is gauge parameter independent , but @xmath19 and @xmath20 do depend on the gauge fixing parameter , therefore the masses obtained from this coupled set of gap equations are gauge dependent .    in the following numerical investigations we shall consider the case of the @xmath21 gauge group .",
    "the 4-dimensional coupling constant is taken at scale @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the @xmath24 scale and 1-loop relation for the gauge parameter of the effective theory is used .",
    "to set the temperature scale we use the relation @xmath25 obtained from numerical simulation of the finite temperature @xmath21 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath26 in a specific gauge is plotted in fig.1 .",
    "as one can see from the plot @xmath26 receives @xmath27 positive correction compared to the leading order result , while the magnetic mass stays very close to the value calculated by buchmller and philipsen @xcite , given below in eq.([egy6 ] ) .",
    "since the masses are gauge dependent in this approach , it is important to investigate the dependence of the screening masses on the gauge parameter @xmath28 .",
    "it turns out that one gets real values for the masses from the gap equations only if @xmath29 .",
    "the dependence of the screening masses on @xmath28 in this range is shown in fig.2 .",
    "one can see , that the @xmath28-dependence of @xmath13 in this interval is 40 % , while for @xmath26 it remains in the 10 % range .",
    "gauge invariant approaches for the magnetic mass generation in three - dimensional pure @xmath0 gauge theory were suggested by buchmller and philipsen ( bp ) @xcite and by alexanian and nair ( an ) @xcite .",
    "the approach of an uses the hard thermal loop inspired effective action for the resummation of the magnetic sector .",
    "the approach of bp using a gauged @xmath30-model , goes over to the @xmath0 gauge theory in the limit of infinitely heavy scalar field .",
    "till now only these two gauge invariant schemes are known to provide real values for the magnetic mass @xcite .    in these approaches",
    "the gauge boson self - energy is automatically transverse and there is no need to project the transverse part from the polarisation tensor .",
    "the corresponding expression for the on - shell self - energy reads _",
    "t(k = i m_t , m_t)=c m_t , where [ egy6 ] c=    since we are interested in calculating the screening masses in the three - dimensional @xmath0 adjoint higgs model , @xmath31 should be supplemented by the corresponding contribution coming from @xmath4 fields . this contribution is calculated from diagrams d ) and e ) of the appendix to be _",
    "ij^a_0(k , m_d)= g^2 n4 ( -m_d2+k^2 + 4 m_d^24 k ) ( _ ij - k_i k_jk^2 ) .",
    "it is transverse and gauge parameter independent , it also does not depend on the specific resummation scheme applied to the magnetostatic sector .",
    "it should be also noticed that it starts to contribute to the gap equation at @xmath32 level in the weak coupling regime , thus preserving the magnetic mass scale to be of order @xmath33 .",
    "this is the reason why no `` hierarchy '' problem arises in this case , at least for moderate g values .",
    "2truecm    the self energy of @xmath4 depends on the specific resummation scheme . for bp resummation it reads & _ 00(k , m_d , m_t)=m^2_d0+g^2 n4",
    "this expression is different from the expression of @xmath34 calculated in the gauge non - invariant approach ( see eq .",
    "( [ reb ] ) ) but its analytic properties and on - shell value is the same as of ( [ reb ] ) . for the resummation scheme of an the self - energy expression of @xmath4 coincides with ( [ reb ] ) if it is evaluated at @xmath35 .",
    "the coupled set of gap equations now can be written as m_t^2&=&c m_t+^a_0(k = i m_t , m_d ) , + m_d^2&=&_00(k = i m_d , m_d , m_t ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath26 obtained from this coupled set of gap equations is shown in fig.3 for both schemes , where we have again normalized the debye mass by the leading order result , @xmath36 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic mass is shown in fig.4 , where we have normalized @xmath13 by the value of the magnetic mass obtained for pure three - dimensional @xmath21 theory , in the bp ( an ) gauge invariant calculations @xcite .",
    "as one can see the contribution of @xmath4 to the magnetic mass is between 1 and 3% . from figures 3 and 4 it",
    "is also seen that the temperature dependence of the screening masses is very similar to the temperature dependence of the respective leading order results .",
    "in the previous section the gap equations were derived for an effective local superrenormalizable theory . in this case",
    "the effect of non - static modes in the 2-point function were represented by the thermal mass for @xmath4 and by the field renormalization factors which relate 3d fields to the corresponding 4d ones .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that when one performs the procedure of the dimensional reduction in @xmath37 gauges the parameters of the superrenormalizable effective theory are gauge independent , only the expressions of 3d fields in terms of 4d ones depend on the gauge parameter .",
    "however , this does not hold for higher dimensional and non - local operators , which are generally gauge dependent . at 1-loop level",
    "the only diagrams contributing non - locally to the gap equation are those which have two non - static line inside the loop , diagrams with one static and one non - static line inside the loop are forbiden because of 4-momentum conservation . therefore at 1-loop level the non - locality scale @xmath38 is much smaller than the relevant length scales .    in general the non - static contribution to the static 2-point function @xmath39",
    "can be written as & ^ns_(k_0=0,k)= ^0 _ _ ^0 ^ns_00(k)+_^i _ ^j ( _ ij- k_i",
    "k_jk^2 ) ( k ) , + & _",

    "the first two terms in the expressions of @xmath34 and first term of @xmath43 are already included into the 3d effective theory as part of the tree level mass and the definition of the 3d fields in term of 4d fields .",
    "the last two sums will contribute to the 3d effective lagrangian as quadratic non - local operators .",
    "there are also higher dimensional operators as well as non - local 3- and 4-point verticies in the effective lagrangian , however , since we restrict our interest to 1-loop gap equations these are not important for us .",
    "their contribution would correspond to 2 or higher loop contribution in the full four - dimensional theory .",
    "we have estimated by direct numerical evaluation of the infinite sums in ( [ nonloc ] ) the contribution of non - local operators to be less than 1% in the temperature range @xmath44 , thus neither their contribution nor their gauge dependence is essential .",
    "in the present paper we have made an attempt to extract the electric and magnetic screening masses from the coupled set of gap equations of the three - dimensional @xmath0 adjoint higgs model considered as an effective theory of qcd .",
    "the screening masses have been studied using gauge non - invariant as well as gauge invariant resummation schemes . in the gauge non - invariant",
    "formalism we have observed rather strong gauge parameter dependence , therefore the results extracted from it are not very informative .",
    "it is still interesting to note that in feynman gauge ( @xmath35 ) the results for the magnetic mass are rather close to those obtained from the gauge invariant resummation scheme of buchmller and philipsen . in gauge invariant treatments",
    "we have compared two different resummation schemes , that of buchmller and philipsen ( bp ) and one proposed by alexanian and nair ( an ) .",
    "qualitativelly these two resummations lead to similar results , but in the bp scheme one has smaller magnetic mass and larger debye mass than in the an scheme .",
    "let us summarize our view on the interaction of the electric @xmath4 and the magnetic @xmath7 fields . in both schemes one can see that the dynamics of @xmath4 is largely influenced by the magnetic sector , however , no similar feedback on the magnetic sector is seen , the magnetic masses calculated from the coupled gap equations provide screening masses which are 1% smaller than evaluated in the pure gauge theory .",
    "this fact suggests that the role of the adjoint scalar field is similar to that of the fundamental higgs field , because the magnetic mass calculated in the symmetric phase of @xmath21 higgs theory using lattice monte - carlo simulation with landau gauge fixing is also roughly the same as in pure gauge theory @xcite .",
    "finally we compare our results with recent monte - carlo data for the screening masses obtained in 4d finite temperature @xmath21 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the data on the magnetic mass found from this simulation in the temperature range @xmath45 can be fitted well by the formula @xmath46 .",
    "this value of the magnetic mass is considerably larger than what one obtains from the magnetic gap equation and 3d simulations , where the results are approximately @xmath47 for the bp scheme , @xmath48 for an scheme and @xmath49 for 3d simulation .",
    "also our results are rather close to these values , as we have demonstrated in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "the data from monte - carlo simulation for the debye mass in the above mentioned temperature interval can be fitted using the following leading order - like anzatz @xmath50 @xcite , which means that the debye mass is roughly @xmath51 , where @xmath36 is the leading order result .",
    "the gap equations at the same time , as one can see from fig.3 give @xmath52 , depending on the resummation scheme . while there is no quantitative agreement between masses measured in monte - carlo simulation and those obtained from the gap equation , the temperature dependence of these masses in the temperature interval @xmath45 seems to follow the temperature dependence of the leading order result .    at the moment",
    "we have no explanation for the reasons of the discrepancy between the results of the 4d simulation and the 3d gap equations and simulation .",
    "the observations may imply that either higher loop contributions to the gap equation are important and therefore the dynamics of @xmath4 is not faithfully reflected by 1-loop gap equations or the dimensional reduction is not valid . in @xcite",
    "the self - consistency of the gap equation has been examined in the entire momentum space in gauge invariant way .",
    "this investigation reveals some inconsistencies of the 1-loop gap equation , which are conjectured to be removed by higher order calculation .",
    "it remains an open question how far these inconsistencies influence the pole mass .",
    "we believe , however , that further studies in this direction , which include 2-loop gap equations @xcite and lattice study of the effective adjoint higgs model @xcite will clarify part of these problems .",
