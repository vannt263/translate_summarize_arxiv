    "what restrictions are there on collections of pairwise disjoint lagrangian submanifolds inside a given symplectic manifold ? this is a reasonably natural question , or rather class of questions , in symplectic topology .",
    "one can view it as an attempt to bound the `` size '' or `` complexity '' of the symplectic manifold under consideration , in analogy with the fact that a closed oriented surface of genus @xmath0 can contain at most @xmath1 pairwise disjoint simple closed curves in a nontrivial sense ( nontrivial means that no curve is contractible , and no two are isotopic ) .",
    "there is additional motivation for specializing to lagrangian spheres , because of their relation with nodal degenerations in algebraic geometry ; and from there possibly further to the three - dimensional case , where collections of disjoint lagrangian three - spheres provide the starting point for the surgery construction from @xcite , itself modelled on small resolutions of nodal singularities . by way of example , let s consider hypersurfaces in projective space , of a fixed degree and dimension",
    ". starting from a hypersurface with nodal singularities , one obtains a collection of pairwise disjoint lagrangian spheres in the corresponding smooth hypersurface , as vanishing cycles ( as an aside , note that since one can choose a hyperplane which misses all the original nodes , the lagrangian spheres obtained in this way actually all lie inside an affine smooth hypersurface ) .",
    "there are numerous constructions of hypersurfaces with many nodes in the literature , see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , p.  419 ) or",
    "* section 8.1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the size of collections obtained in this way is limited by known upper bounds for the possible number of nodes , such as those derived in @xcite using hodge - theoretic methods .",
    "it is an interesting open question how these bounds compare to the situation for general collections of lagrangian spheres .",
    "there are reasons to be cautious about proposing a direct relationship .",
    "one is the possible existence of nodal degenerations where the special fibre is not itself a hypersurface , even though a smooth fibre is ( this is certainly an issue in the toy case of algebraic curves : the maximal number of nodes on a plane curve of degree @xmath2 , including reducible curves , is @xmath3 by the plcker formula , and that is less than @xmath4 for @xmath5 ) . from a wider perspective , there are other constructions of lagrangian spheres ( as components of real loci , or more speculatively in terms of syz fibrations ) which are not a priori related to vanishing cycles .",
    "let s return to the general question as formulated at the outset .",
    "for any oriented closed totally real submanifold @xmath6 in an almost complex manifold @xmath7 , the selfintersection equals the euler characteristic up to a dimension - dependent sign : @xmath8 \\cdot [ l ] = ( -1)^{n(n+1)/2 } \\chi(l).\\ ] ] this holds mod @xmath9 without the orientation assumption ( there is also a mod @xmath10 version in the unoriented case , involving the pontryagin square @xcite ; but we wo nt use it ) .    [ th : folk ] fix some field @xmath11 .",
    "consider closed totally real submanifolds @xmath12 such that @xmath13 is not a multiple of the characteristic @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath15 , we also assume that our @xmath16 are oriented .",
    "let @xmath17 be a collection of such submanifolds , which are pairwise disjoint ( or disjoinable by homotopies ) .",
    "then the classes @xmath18,\\dots,[l_r ] \\in h_n(m;{{\\mathbb k}})$ ] are linearly independent .    that follows directly from , since any relation @xmath19 + \\cdots + a_r[l_r ] = 0 $ ] implies that @xmath20 \\cdot ( a_1[l_1 ] + \\cdots + a_r[l_r ] ) = ( -1)^{n(n+1)/2 } a_i \\,\\chi(l_i ) \\in { { \\mathbb k}},\\ ] ] and @xmath21 is nonzero as an element of @xmath11 by assumption",
    ". the limitations of such topological methods are clear : @xmath22 contains an embedded totally real three - sphere , hence also ( by translating it ) an infinite number of pairwise disjoint such spheres . within symplectic topology properly speaking , one can group the existing literature into two approaches .",
    "the first one is quite general in principle , but hard to carry out in practice : it considers lagrangian submanifolds as objects of the fukaya category with suitable properties , and proceeds via a classification of such objects up to isomorphism .",
    "the second approach is a priori limited to manifolds with semisimple quantum cohomology rings .",
    "one could view the two as related , since in many examples the fukaya categories of manifolds with semisimple quantum cohomology are themselves semisimple , hence lend themselves easily to a classification of objects .",
    "however , the point of the second approach is precisely that one can bypass an explicit study of the fukaya category , and instead just use general properties of open - closed string maps . we will now survey both approaches briefly .",
    "possibly the earliest example of this strategy is ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1(4 ) ) about cotangent bundles of odd - dimensional spheres ( the resulting statement is in fact a special case of an earlier theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thorme 2 ) ; but the earlier proof lies outside the scope of our discussion , because it uses a geometric trick specific to homogeneous spaces ) . since then , the state of knowledge about cotangent bundles has developed considerably @xcite .",
    "maybe more importantly for our purpose , there is at least one case other than cotangent bundles which has been successfully analyzed in this way , namely the milnor fibres of type @xmath23 singularities @xcite :    [ th : equivariant ] let @xmath7 be the milnor fibre of the @xmath23 singularity , with @xmath24 odd and arbitrary @xmath25 .",
    "consider lagrangian submanifolds @xmath12 which are rational homology spheres and _ spin_. then :    \\(i ) @xmath26 \\in h_n(m;{{\\mathbb z}})$ ] is nonzero and primitive .",
    "\\(ii ) two such submanifolds which are disjoint must have different mod @xmath9 homology classes .",
    "the necessary algebraic classification of objects in the fukaya category of @xmath27 was carried out by hand in @xcite for @xmath28 , whereas @xcite relied on algebro - geometric results from @xcite . as an illustration of the difficulty of obtaining such a classification ,",
    "note that so far we only have partial analogues of the results from @xcite for the remaining simple singularities , of types @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "results that fall into this class can be found in @xcite ( a significant precursor is @xcite ) .",
    "here is a sample :    [ th : semisimple ] let @xmath27 be a closed monotone symplectic manifold , whose ( @xmath31-graded ) quantum cohomology @xmath32 , defined over some algebraically closed field @xmath11 , is semisimple . consider monotone lagrangian submanifolds @xmath12 which are oriented and _ spin _ ( if @xmath33 , one can drop the _ spin _ assumption ) .",
    "let @xmath17 be a collection of such submanifolds , which are pairwise disjoint or disjoinable by hamiltonian isotopies .",
    "\\(i ) suppose that @xmath34 for all @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 , where the right hand side is the sum of the even betti numbers ( with @xmath11-coefficients ) .",
    "\\(ii ) in the same situation , suppose that all the @xmath37 \\in h_n(m;{{\\mathbb k}})$ ] are nonzero",
    ". then they must be linearly independent .",
    "a short outline of the argument may be appropriate .",
    "first , semisimplicity of @xmath38 means that its even part splits as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a collection of pairwise orthogonal idempotents . because the intersection pairing is nondegenerate , it must be nontrivial on each summand .",
    "fix some @xmath16 , and consider the open - closed string map @xmath41 because of its compatibility with the structure of @xmath42 as a module over @xmath38 , the image of in even degrees consists of a subset of summands in .",
    "moreover , if @xmath42 is nonzero , the composition of with @xmath43 is nontrivial , hence the previously mentioned subset is nonempty . finally , if @xmath44 is well - defined and vanishes , then the images of the open - closed string maps for @xmath45 and @xmath46 must be mutually orthogonal with respect to the intersection pairing ( by a form of the cardy relation , see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.3 and figure 2 ) ) . this implies ( i )",
    "provided that all lagrangian submanifolds involved have minimal maslov number @xmath47 , so that @xmath44 is always well - defined . to remove that additional assumption ,",
    "one decomposes @xmath48 into eigenspaces of quantum multiplication with @xmath49 , and considers the lagrangian submanifolds with any given maslov index @xmath9 disc count separately , using ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 6.7 ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare the argument so far with theorem [ th : folk ] .",
    "what we have done is to replace the intersection pairing on @xmath50 with that on each summand in considered separately .",
    "the shift to even degrees ensures that the argument can be effective even if @xmath51 is odd , but at the same time prevents us from proving that the @xmath37 $ ] are nonzero ( which is indeed false , even for @xmath52 ) .",
    "instead , for part ( ii ) of theorem [ th : semisimple ] one argues as follows .",
    "the class @xmath26 $ ] is the image of the unit element in @xmath53 under . in particular , if @xmath26 $ ] is nonzero , then so is @xmath42 .",
    "now , for a collection @xmath17 as in the statement of the theorem , we get a decomposition of @xmath38 into direct summands , and each @xmath37 $ ] must lie in a different summand , which precludes having any nontrivial relations ( in fact , not just relations over @xmath11 , but ones with coefficients in @xmath48 as well ) .",
    "we now turn to the actual substance of this paper .",
    "[ th:1 ] let @xmath7 , @xmath54 odd , be a ( finite type complete ) liouville manifold .",
    "this should satisfy @xmath55 , and we choose a trivialization of the anticanonical bundle @xmath56 .",
    "assume that its ( @xmath57-graded ) symplectic cohomology @xmath58 , with coefficients in some field @xmath11 , contains a dilation .",
    "then there is a constant @xmath59 such that the following holds .",
    "consider closed lagrangian submanifolds in @xmath27 which are @xmath11-homology spheres and _ spin_. suppose that @xmath17 is a collection of such submanifolds , which are pairwise disjoint ( or disjoinable by lagrangian isotopies ) .",
    "then @xmath60 .",
    "the notion of dilation comes from @xcite .",
    "the _ spin _",
    "assumption on lagrangian submanifolds arises as usual from sign considerations in floer theory , and one can drop it in @xmath33 .",
    "that would make no difference in the context of theorem [ th:1 ] , since a homology sphere over a field of characteristic @xmath9 must be _ spin _ anway .",
    "however , one can do a little better by exploiting fortuitous cancellations . recall that the ( @xmath61-coefficient ) kervaire semi - characteristic of a closed manifold of odd dimension @xmath51 is @xcite @xmath62 semi - characteristics have appeared before in the context of totally real embeddings @xcite , but that has apparently nothing to do with our result , which is the following :    [ th:2 ] let @xmath27 be as in theorem [ th:1 ] , and suppose that @xmath33 .",
    "replace the topological assumptions on closed lagrangian submanifolds @xmath12 with the following weaker ones : @xmath63 then the same conclusion will hold .    making the bound @xmath59 explicit depends on an understanding of the geometry of the dilation . in particularly simple cases ,",
    "one may be able to make a connection with the ordinary topology of @xmath27 .",
    "here is an instance where that is possible :    [ th:3 ] take an affine algebraic hypersurface @xmath64 , with @xmath51 odd , which has an isolated singular point at the origin .",
    "suppose that the hessian of the defining polynomial at the singular point satisfies @xmath65 let @xmath27 be the milnor fibre of that singularity .",

    "we refer interested readers to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lectures 1319 ) , where both viewpoints are considered .",
    "concerning the comparison with theorem [ th : semisimple ] and other results of that nature , we were unable to find a substantial relation between them and our approach .",
    "there is some common philosophical ground , in that both approaches are based on replacing the intersection pairing in middle - dimensional homology with another one , which has different symmetry properties ; and that for this replacement to work , strong restrictions on the class of symplectic manifolds under consideration have to be imposed .",
    "however , in theorem [ th : semisimple ] the replacement is essentially the even - dimensional cohomology , whereas in our case we remain in the middle dimension but replace cohomology with a different space , built from symplectic cohomology .",
    "finally , note that in all our theorems , we have required the ( complex ) dimension @xmath51 to be odd .",
    "in fact , the proof of theorem [ th:1 ] works for all @xmath77 ; and there is an analogue of theorem [ th:2 ] for even @xmath51 , which involves half of the ordinary euler characteristic instead of the semi - characteristic ( in the proof , part ( ii ) of corollary [ th : new - main - properties ] would be used instead of ( iii ) , with the rest of the argument remaining the same ) .",

    "this is not strictly necessary for our argument , but can provide additional motivation .",

    ". we also want it to satisfy @xmath55 , and fix a trivialization ( up to homotopy ) of the anticanonical bundle @xmath93 .",
    "finally , we need some property that prevents solutions of floer - type equations from escaping to infinity . this holds with respect to some fixed compatible almost complex structure @xmath94 .",
