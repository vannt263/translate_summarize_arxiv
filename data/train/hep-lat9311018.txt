    "let us consider a scalar field model with action @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a @xmath4 complex matrix and @xmath5 is space - time dimension .",

    "( [ eq : model ] ) can be first order due to the well known coleman - weinberg phenomenon @xcite .",
    "a qualitative argument for the coleman - weinberg phenomenon has been developed based on the effective potential and the renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite .",
    "essentially first order pt occurs due to the existence of run - away rg trajectories . however , physical applications of eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) rely on the rg flow obtained in perturbation @xcite or @xmath11 expansion extrapolated to @xmath12@xcite .",
    "it is important to extend these arguments in a nonperturbative study .",
    "our first numerical results in 4d are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , which we refer to for details of the lattice simulations and discussions of their relevance to the continuum physics . as an illustration for the quantum fluctuation induced first order pt , we plot in fig .",
    "1 a comparison of the one - loop perturbative calculation with mc data in the weak coupling region . here",
    "the one - loop effect changes the second order pt at the tree level to first order .",
    "first order pt were also found in the strong coupling region @xcite , indicating the absence of a stable infrared fixed point there .",
    "in three dimensions , eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) can be used to describe the qcd finite temperature chiral phase transition ( chpt ) @xcite . here",
    "the order of pt depends crucially on the number of fermion flavor @xmath13 and the pattern of symmetry . for @xmath14 chpt",
    "is in general expected to be first order @xcite . for @xmath15 , if the axial @xmath1 anomaly remains effective up to the chpt temperature @xmath16 , the symmetry of the system will be @xmath17 and the transition can be second order . however ,",
    "@xmath1 symmetry could be restored below @xmath16 , the symmetry becomes @xmath18 and chpt would be first order @xcite .    so far there is no numerical evidence for a first order chpt for @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "does this imply that the @xmath1 symmetry is not restored below @xmath16 ?",
    "the answer can not be conclusive .",
    "in fact , as we will show in the following using the effective action in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) : even if we _",
    "assume _ the @xmath1 symmetry is restored below @xmath16 , chpt can be very weakly first order . for @xmath19 the rg flow for eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) is plotted in fig . 2 where the @xmath20-functions are obtained in @xmath21 expansion with @xmath22 .",
    "there is a uv fixed point at @xmath23 ( solid circle ) and a unstable ir fixed point at @xmath24 ( solid square ) .",
    "the dotted lines in fig .",
    "2 indicate the `` stability line '' ( sl ) .",
    "qualitatively , for a renormalized theory located to the left side of sl , pt will be first order @xcite . however , pt can be weakly or strongly first order depending on the choice of the bare lagrangian .",
    "the rg running of @xmath25 is very slow in the weak coupling region and becomes fast in the strong @xmath26 region .",
    "a weak coupling bare action chosen to the right side of sl will need many decades of running in energy scale in order to cross sl .",
    "therefore , even though the pt will be first order , the jump in the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath27 , at the transition point can be many orders of magnitude smaller than the `` cut - off '' scale @xmath28 and the transition can be very weakly first order @xcite .",
    "as an example , we plot @xmath29 in fig . 3 for @xmath30 . obviously , it is almost impossible to decide numerically at this point if the pt is second order or weakly first order . here",
    "we wish to correct an error appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "the point at @xmath31 ( solid circle in fig .",
    "3 ) which was claimed to be the critical point of a first order pt @xcite is actually deeply in the broken phase .    the search for a first order pt is further complicated on a finite lattice .",
    "the running of @xmath25 is controlled by the correlation length @xmath32 , which is limited by the box size @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , a bare action fixed to the right of sl will only be able to run across sl in a large enough box @xcite .",
    "the first order nature of the pt will not appear until the simulation is performed on a large lattice .",
    "there is an interesting example of this phenomenon in the literature @xcite . in the simulation of @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model , which is in the same universality class as eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) , it was found that for @xmath19 the first order nature of the pt could be exposed only on lattices larger than @xmath34 .",
    "we should also point out that for the same initial values of @xmath35 , the rg running is faster with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "this explains the stronger first order pt for @xmath37 in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to observe the first order pt in a small box , one either has to move the bare action close to sl in the weak coupling region , or move to the strong @xmath26 region where the speed of running is fast @xcite .",
    "we give an example in fig .",
    "4 where the bare action is set to be very close to sl .",
    "we are able to observe clear signal for a first order pt on the @xmath38 lattice .",
    "what are the implications for finite temperature qcd ?",
    "let us assume that eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) becomes a good effective theory for qcd at energy scale @xmath39 .",
    "then the strength of first order pt crucially depends on the values of the effective coupling at scale @xmath28 . as discussed above ,",
    "if @xmath40 fall into the weak coupling region , finding the first order pt will become a tough job .",
    "while it is not possible to determine @xmath41 for qcd , it was found in a large color ( @xmath42 ) approximation for the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model that @xmath43 @xcite where @xmath44is the cut - off for njl model and @xmath28 is the scale when the linear sigma model becomes a good effective theory .",
    "although njl model is a poor approximation of qcd , we might believe that it is at least qualitatively correct .",
    "then @xmath26 can be strong or weak depending on the ratio @xmath45 ( one might take @xmath46 ) . since @xmath26 does not depend on @xmath13 ,",
    "the only feature that distinguishes flavor is the speed of rg flow .",
    "we could immediately draw a conclusion that it would be easier to observe the first order pt for @xmath47 than @xmath15 , which agrees with well known simulation results @xcite . even in the case of @xmath48 and @xmath26",
    "is very large ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) becomes effectively the nonlinear sigma model ) , results of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that one may need a quite large lattice to expose the first order nature of pt .    beyond large @xmath42 limit ,",
    "one in principle can not eliminate the possibility of a stronger @xmath13 dependence for qcd .",
    "then for @xmath15 , @xmath49 could fall in the very weak coupling region such that pt is extremely weak first order ."
