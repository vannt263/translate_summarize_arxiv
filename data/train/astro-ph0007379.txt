    "liners ( low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ; heckman 1980 ) are fairly common in nearby galaxies .",
    "a recent optical spectroscopic survey of nearby galactic nuclei has shown that @xmath430% of bright galaxies have liners ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997a , 1997b ; ho et al .",
    "the ionization mechanism of liners is still controversial ( see filippenko 1996 for a review ) .",
    "there are several ionization mechanisms , which can explain liner type optical emission lines , such as ( 1 ) photoionization by low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) , ( 2 ) photoionization by very hot wolf - rayet stars or o - stars , ( 3 ) shocks , ( 4 ) cooling flows , and so on .",
    "recent multiwavelength observations argue that a significant fraction of liners are genuine agns ( e.g. , ho 1999a ) .",
    "detection of an x - ray nucleus is one of the most convincing pieces of evidence for the presence of an agn . from x - ray observations , the presence of llagns in liners",
    "is reported for several objects ( ho 1999a ; terashima et al . 2000b , and references therein ) and their luminosities ranges from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ergs s@xmath2 , which is about 13 orders of magnitude lower than typical seyfert galaxies .",
    "if such llagns are the dominant ionizing source of the liner - type emission lines , the optical emission - line luminosities are expected to be proportional to the luminosities of the ionizing photons from the llagns . indeed , a strong positive correlation between optical emission - line ( h@xmath3 , h@xmath7 , [ ] ) luminosities and x - ray luminosities is observed for luminous agns ( kriss et al .",
    "1982 ; elvis , soltan , & keel 1984 ; ward et al . 1988",
    "; mulchaey et al .",
    "koratkar et al .",
    "( 1995 ) reported that this correlation extends to intrinsically faint objects based on _ rosat _ observations of five low - luminosity seyfert galaxies in the soft x - ray band .",
    "a small number of liners have been studied with _ einstein _ , and a similar correlation is suggested ( halpern & steiner 1983 ; elvis et al . 1984 ) .    the ionization mechanisms of liners , however , could be heterogeneous , and it is also possible that ionization sources other than agns are present .",
    "if other ionization mechanisms play a role , the x - ray luminosities are expected to be small compared to given optical emission - line luminosities ( prez - olea & colina 1996 ) .    in this paper , we present _ asca _  measurements of x - ray fluxes of liners and low - luminosity seyfert galaxies in the 210 kev band and examine the probable ionization mechanism in liners by comparing x - ray luminosities with h@xmath3 luminosities .",
    "we have systematically analyzed _ asca _  archival and proprietary data of liners in the bright galaxy sample of ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "we also analyzed low - luminosity seyfert galaxies ( hereafter referred as llseyfert ) with @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 ergs s@xmath2 , which is smaller than or comparable to that of the well - studied low - luminosity seyfert galaxy ngc 4051 , to compare their x - ray properties with those of liners and to discriminate the ionizing source in liners .",
    "detailed results will be presented in a future paper ( terashima et al .",
    "we also use several objects in the southern hemisphere with good _ asca _  data ( iyomoto et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "we use only galaxies for which optical emission - line luminosities are published in the literature .",
    "note that our sample is not complete and that some of the galaxies in our sample are selected based on large h@xmath3 fluxes ( see terashima et al .",
    "therefore , our sample is not an x - ray selected sample , and so it is not significantly biased toward x - ray bright objects .    the optical classifications , adopted distances , broad and narrow h@xmath3 luminosities , and x - ray luminosities in the 210 kev band are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we refer to objects with and without broad h@xmath3 emission as type 1 ( liner 1s and llseyfert 1s ) and type 2 objects ( liner 2s and llseyfert 2s ) , respectively , by analogy with seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s .",
    "two objects ( ngc 4192 and ngc 4569 ) are classified as a transition object between a liner and an nucleus .",
    "although ngc 1097 was a liner 2 historically ( phillips et al . 1984 ) , we adopt a classification of seyfert 1.5 based on storchi - bergmann , baldwin , & wilson ( 1993 ) since the _ asca _  observation was performed after the appearance of double - peaked broad h@xmath3 .",
    "h@xmath3 luminosities are taken from ho et al .",
    "( 1997a , c ) except for several objects ( see table 1 for references ) .",
    "we estimated the amount of reddening by the balmer decrement for narrow lines and corrected for reddening using the reddening curve of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , where we assumed the theoretical value of h@xmath3/h@xmath7=3.1 . in the case",
    "that the observed h@xmath3/h@xmath7 is less than 3.1 , no correction was made .",
    "the reddening corrections for broad h@xmath3 lines were made by same amount as narrow lines .",
    "x - ray emission is detected from all the objects except for ngc 404 .",
    "the x - ray spectra of most of the objects are represented by a two - component model consisting of an optically - thin thermal plasma with a temperature of @xmath40.7 kev and a hard component .",
    "spectra of a few objects do not require a soft thermal component .",
    "the hard component is well represented by a power law with a photon index of @xmath4 1.52.0 .",
    "detailed results of spectral fits are given in terashima et al .",
    "( 2000b ) . the absorption column density for the hard component ranges from @xmath11 to @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "we will make use of the intrinsic luminosities of the hard component corrected for the absorption in the 210 kev band . among the objects in our sample , seven objects ( ngc 1052 , 1365 , 2639 , 4258 , 2273 , 2655 , and 4941 )",
    "have a heavily absorbed ( @xmath14@xmath15 @xmath13 ) transmitted continuum in their spectra , and the correction of the absorption is significant . adopted column densities of these objects are 2.0 , 2.8 , 4.8 , 1.3 , 4.6 , 4.0 , 10 @xmath16 @xmath13 , respectively , as measured in terashima et al .",
    "( 2000b ) and references in table 1 .",
    "if the absorption column is greater than @xmath12 @xmath13 and a transmitted hard x - ray continuum is not seen , corrections for the absorption can not be made .",
    "in such a case , we utilize the observed luminosities corrected for only the galactic absorption .",
    "these luminosities are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the x - ray luminosities range from 4@xmath0  ergs s@xmath2 to 5@xmath1  ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "results of _ asca _ observations for several objects have been already published , and references for them are also shown in table 1 .",
    "in order to examine whether optical emission lines in liner 1s are photonionized by high - energy photons from an agn , we search for a correlation between x - ray luminosities in the 210 kev band ( @xmath17 ) and h@xmath3 luminosities ( @xmath9 ) for objects with broad h@xmath3 in their optical spectra .",
    "it is known that a significant positive correlation between these two quantities exists for luminous agns ( e.g. , ward et al .",
    "if photoionization by an llagn is the dominant ionization mechanism in liner 1s , an @xmath17-@xmath9 correlation is expected .",
    "figure 1a shows the correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath9 for liner 1s and llseyfert 1s in our sample and luminous seyfert 1s and qsos taken from ward et al .",
    "( 1988 ) ; the h@xmath3 luminosities shown represent the sum of the narrow and broad components of the line .",
    "it is clear that the correlation extends to lower luminosities .",
    "the same correlation using fluxes is shown in figure 1b .",
    "the correlation is still significant in this plot .",
    "this correlation strongly suggests that the dominant ionization source in liner 1s is photoionization by llagns with luminosities less than @xmath18 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "the scatter in the plots could be due to x - ray and h@xmath3 variability of a factor of a few or more since x - ray and h@xmath3 luminosities were not obtained simultaneously .",
    "a drastic example is an appearance of a double - peaked broad h@xmath3 in ngc 1097 , ngc 4203 , and ngc 4450 ( storchi - bergmann et al . 1993 , 1995 ;",
    "shields et al .",
    "2000 ; ho et al .",
    "note that the seyfert 1.8 galaxy ngc 1365 is probably compton thick , and the x - ray luminosity is not corrected for absorption .",
    "therefore , the data point is less luminous in x - rays by about two orders of magnitude than the correlation .",
    "the x - ray images in the 210 kev band of most liner 1s are unresolved within the spatial resolution of _ asca _  ( fwhm @xmath19 0.5@xmath20 ) and consistent with the llagn interpretation as the origin of hard x - rays .",
    "note that hard x - ray emission from ngc 4636 is clearly extended compared to the point - spread function , and an agn is not the dominant x - ray source ( matsushita et al .",
    "1994 ; terashima et al .",
    "therefore , the x - ray luminosity of this object should be regarded as an upper limit .",
    "this upper limit is still consistent with the correlation above .",
    "if we exclude ngc 1365 , 4636 , and 4438 , the latter having a very small @xmath17/@xmath9 ratio ( @xmath213.2 ) , the correlation for the sample of liner 1s , llseyfert 1s , and luminous agns plotted in figure 1a is expressed as @xmath8@xmath17 = ( @xmath22 ) @xmath8@xmath9 + ( @xmath23 ) ( errors are 90% confidence ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from liner 1s is most likely dominated by agns .",
    "if liner 2s are also llagns , they might be obscured , by analogy with seyfert 2s , and the x - ray continuum emission is expected to be absorbed by a large column density . on the other hand , with other ionization mechanism such as hot stars or shocks resulting from starburst activity , an @xmath17/@xmath9 value is expected to be small compared to those for agn ( prez - olea & colina 1996 ) . in figure 2 , we compare the luminosity ratio @xmath17/@xmath9 for the different object classes to examine whether the ionization mechanism in liner 2s is the same as in liner 1s and llseyferts ; in this comparison we make use only of the narrow component of the h@xmath3 line . the mean of the @xmath17/@xmath9 distributions for llseyfert 1s , llseyfert 2s , liner 1s , and liner 2s are 52.8 , 10.3 , 67.3 , and 7.7 , respectively",
    ". thus the mean of @xmath17/@xmath9 for liner 2s is about one order of magnitude smaller than those for llseyfert 1s and liner 1s .",
    "a few liner 2s ( ngc 4261 , ngc 4594 , and ngc 4736 ) have an @xmath17/@xmath9 ratio similar to liner 1s and llseyfert 1s , while many liner 2s have a small @xmath17/@xmath9 . some llseyferts with small @xmath17/@xmath9 are most probably compton thick objects in which only scattered x - rays are observed ( ngc 1365 , iyomoto et al . 1997 ; ngc 1386 , maiolino et al .",
    "1998 , bassani et al . 1999",
    "; ngc 5194 , terashima et al .",
    "1998b ) since these objects have a strong fe - k emission line with an equivalent width of @xmath24 1 kev , and the intrinsic @xmath17/@xmath9 values could be 12 orders of magnitude larger than observed .",
    "there is no clear x - ray evidence for the presence of heavily obscured agn in ngc 3079 and ngc 7743 , although such a possibility can not be ruled out .",
    "if we assume a spectral energy distribution from uv to x - ray is power - law shape with an index of 1 ( @xmath25 ) ( ho 1999b ) , @xmath8 @xmath17/@xmath9 should be greater than 1.4 to drive h@xmath3 luminosities by photoionization under case b recombination and a covering fraction of unity ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "since x - ray luminosities of most liner 2s are small ( @xmath17@xmath26 ergs s@xmath2 ) , x - ray binaries in the host galaxy might also contribute to observed x - ray fluxes .",
    "actually some objects such as ngc 3607 , ngc 4111 , ngc 4374 , and ngc 4569 have hard band ( @xmath242 kev ) images extended to several kpc ( terashima et al .",
    "2000a , b ) , which implies a lower value of @xmath17/@xmath9 for the nuclear component .",
    "therefore the objects with low @xmath8 @xmath17/@xmath9 ( @xmath271 ) are too x - ray weak to ionize optical emission lines , even if x - ray variability of a factor of a few is also taken into account . if an agn is present and is the dominant ionizing source in these objects , it should be obscured even at energies above 2 kev .",
    "although no clear evidence for the presence of heavily obscured agn ( e.g. heavily absorbed x - ray continuum and/or strong fe - k emission line ) has been obtained so far , the current data can not rule out such a possibility .",
    "alternatively , there might be other ionization sources .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "uv spectra of ngc 404 and ngc 4569 actually show large number of hot stars concentrated in pc - scale nuclear regions ( maoz et al .",
    "1998 ) , and these objects could be examples of liners ionized by stellar sources ( terashima et al .",
    "2000a ) .",
    "according to the optical spectroscopic survey by ho et al .",
    "( 1997a , b ) , seyferts , liner 1s and liner 2s are detected in 11% , 5% , 28% of northern ( @xmath28 ) bright ( @xmath29 mag ) galaxies .",
    "if we assume an extreme case that all seyferts and liner 1s are agns and all liner 2s are not agns , the fraction of agn is estimated to be 16% of bright galaxies .",
    "this percentage , however , should be regarded as a lower limit because extremely weak broad h@xmath3 is difficult to detect unambiguously ( ho et al .",
    "furthermore , some liner 2s clearly indicate agn - like activity .",
    "for example , ngc 4261 has prominent radio jets and kinematic evidence for a massive black hole ( ferrarese , ford , & jaffe 1996 ) .",
    "other examples include the `` sombrero '' galaxy ( ngc 4594 ) and ngc 4736 . the @xmath17/@xmath9 values for these object are similar to liner 1s and llseyferts .",
    "this fact also indicates that the @xmath17/@xmath9 ratio is a good indicator of the presence of agns .",
    "hard x - ray surveys conducted at high angular resolution , such as afforded by _",
    ", would be crucial to refine the true agn fraction in nearby galaxies .",

    "<S> the observed x - ray luminosities in these objects are insufficient to power their h@xmath3 luminosities , suggesting that their primary ionizing source is other than an agn , or that an agn , if present , is obscured even at energies above 2 kev . </S>"
