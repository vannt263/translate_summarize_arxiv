    "production and fragmentation of heavy quarks is one of the most dynamical fields of research in qcd precision tests .",
    "there is an active interplay between experimental analysis and theoretical developments in this area .",
    "the aim of the working group was to discuss the relevant experimental and theoretical results that became available or updated since the previous dis workshop in 2008 .",
    "they are summarised here in three sections : news from theory ( section 2 ) , news from proton and heavy ion colliders ( section 3 ) , and news from hera and @xmath1 colliders ( section 4 ) .",
    "theoretical activity in heavy flavours has been brisk during the last year , spurred by new experimental measurements and some outstanding challenges .",
    "theory talks given in this session were invited on the following topics :    * applications of the general - mass variable - flavour - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) . * theoretical progress in structure functions ( sfs ) , parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , fragmentation functions ( ffs ) and heavy flavour production cross sections .",
    "* studies of the @xmath2 data on the production cross sections and polarisation .",
    "* spectroscopy of the @xmath3-baryons and interpretations of the states @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "these topics were addressed in 13 theory talks . in this section ,",
    "salient features of the presentations are summarised and briefly commented .      in heavy quark production processes with two large scales , @xmath7 , the heavy quark mass , and @xmath8 , the transverse momentum of the produced heavy quarks",
    ", one would like to absorb the logarithms @xmath9 present in the perturbative framework , which are large in the region @xmath10 , into the pdfs and ffs , where they are resummed using the dglap evolution as in the massless case .",
    "however , one would also like to retain the finite mass terms proportional to @xmath11 in the hard - scattering cross sections .",
    "the gm - vfns enables to accomplish these goals in a two - step procedure : in the first step , massless and massive quark calculations are matched .",
    "the key point is to isolate the collinear singularities in the massive calculation @xmath12 , which are cancelled by subtracting the massless calculation ( in the @xmath13 scheme ) , @xmath14 , but the residue @xmath15 , defined as @xmath16 , contains finite terms . the second step is to subtract @xmath15 from @xmath17 , the cross section with @xmath18 , in which the ultraviolet and collinear singularities due to massless partons have also been removed using the @xmath13 factorisation scheme . the resulting cross section @xmath19 is the desired quantity , in which finite quark mass terms are kept in the hard scattering cross section but the pdfs and ffs for the massless partons in the @xmath13 scheme are used .",
    "details can be seen in  @xcite .",
    "the gm - vfns approach has been applied to a number of inclusive one - particle production cross sections in the processes @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . of these ,",
    "the photoproduction @xmath21 , open charm hadroproduction @xmath24 , and heavy quark electroproduction are being discussed in detail in these proceedings by spiesberger  @xcite , kniehl  @xcite , and alekhin  @xcite , respectively . in photoproduction",
    ", one has to treat consistently the contributions from the direct and resolved processes . at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) theoretical precision , the separation into direct and resolved contributions becomes scheme - dependent , as the singular contributions to the direct photon part have to be factorised and absorbed into the parton distribution functions of the photon .",
    "data on photo- and electro - production of @xmath25 meson from h1 and zeus have been analysed in the gm - vfns framework  @xcite .",
    "there is good overall agreement between data and theory , but the theoretical uncertainties are still large , dominated by the ambiguity in the choice of the renormalisation and factorisation scales . in the small-@xmath8 region , theoretical prediction is uncertain by typically a factor 2 which then is propagated to the entire rapidity distributions , as they were measured with a relatively small lower cuts , @xmath26 gev for the photoproduction data from h1 and @xmath27 gev for low-@xmath28 data from zeus . a nnlo calculation is required to reduce these uncertainties .",
    "a monte carlo programme for heavy quark production based on the nlo calculations has also been developed and is now in use in the analysis of the hera data  @xcite .",
    "transverse - momentum distributions for the charmed hadrons in @xmath29 are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the essential improvement here is a better determination of the ffs using the lep1 , kekb and cesr data in the gm - vfns scheme , which has resulted in better agreement of the @xmath8-distributions of the charmed hadrons at the tevatron . in the gm - vfns scheme ,",
    "d - meson hadroproduction receives contributions from the partonic processes with incoming @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and hence this process is sensitive to their pdfs and possible intrinsic charm ( ic)-induced enhancements . the ic contribution has been studied in a variety of different models and analysed in  @xcite using the cteq6.5 global analysis  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8-distributions in @xmath32 at the tevatron and in @xmath33 at rhic ( with @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 gev ) have been calculated in the gm - vfns scheme and the former are compared with the tevatron data , using six different parameterisations of the ic - contribution .",
    "unfortunately , no firm conclusions can be drawn as the present tevatron data , which is of the 2002 vintage , is based on rather modest luminosity ( 5.8 pb@xmath36 ) .",
    "this will change greatly if the full force of the current tevatron integrated luminosity ( circa @xmath37fb@xmath36 ) is brought to bear on this analysis .",
    "data at rhic are also potentially sensitive to the input ic - contribution and will be able to discriminate among the various ic - models in the future .",
    "the charm structure function @xmath38 measured in the dis electroproduction at hera was discussed by alekhin  @xcite in the context of the two schemes ffns ( fixed flavour - number scheme ) and the vfns , using the buza - matiounine - smith - van neerven ( bmsn ) prescription  @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion from this analysis is that for the realistic hera kinematics , the two schemes are rather similar .",
    "ffns with partial @xmath39 corrections incorporated provides a good description of the hera data for small / moderate @xmath28 values , but it undershoots the data for high @xmath28 , calling for including the remaining @xmath39 pieces .",
    "finally , an intermediate mass scheme was discussed by nadolsky  @xcite and a global pdf analysis was carried out in this scheme with the conclusion that the intermediate - mass formulation improves the nlo zero - mass scheme and approximates the more fundamental general - mass scheme ( gm - vfns ) in a simple way .",
    "state of the art qcd analysis requires the description of the heavy quark contribution to the structure functions at 3 loops to match the accuracy reached in the massless partonic case . making use of the factorisation property of the heavy quark wilson coefficients , denoted by @xmath40 , into a product of the massive operator matrix elements @xmath41 , and the light flavour wilson coefficients @xmath42 , which holds in the region @xmath43",
    ", one has @xmath44 analytic results are known for @xmath43 at nlo for @xmath45 and at nnlo for @xmath46 .",
    "the light flavour wilson coefficients are also known at the nnlo , thanks to the formidable calculation by vermaseren , vogt and moch  @xcite . at this conference ,",
    "massive operator matrix elements @xmath47 , contributing to @xmath45 were reported in the region @xmath48 to 3-loop accuracy for the fixed moments of the mellin variable @xmath49  @xcite . in a computational _ tour de force _ , the following fixed moments of the massive operator matrix elements were accomplished  @xcite : @xmath50 the superscript @xmath51 stands for the pure singlet ( non - singlet ) case , and the quarkonic operator matrix element is represented as @xmath52 . in the case of the flavour non - singlet contributions , also the odd moments are calculated .",
    "this provides an independent check on the 3-loop anomalous dimensions @xmath53 , @xmath54 and on the respective colour projections of @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "phenomenological parameterisations are to follow soon .",
    "heavy flavour effects in the virtual photon structure functions in the nlo accuracy were reported at this meeting by uematsu  @xcite .",
    "concentrating on @xmath58 , where @xmath28 is the photon virtuality and @xmath59 the target ( photon ) mass , one has the factorisation result as a convolution in the virtual photon distribution function @xmath60 and the coefficient function @xmath61 @xmath62 where the heavy quark mass dependence enters in both the terms .",
    "taking the moments of @xmath60 , one can write the resulting expression as a product of two terms @xmath63,\\ ] ] where the matrix element @xmath64 is perturbatively calculable .",
    "thus , as opposed to the nucleon structure functions discussed above , the photon structure function is completely calculable perturbatively , as first emphasised by witten  @xcite .",
    "this framework has been applied in the massive quark limit @xmath65 to the pluto data with @xmath66 gev@xmath67 and @xmath68 gev@xmath67 , with the conclusion that the data is in better agreement with the case of 3 massless nlo qcd @xmath69 @xmath30 massive compared to the 4 massless nlo qcd case  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the massive @xmath3 quark + 4 massless quarks case with the l3 data for @xmath70 gev@xmath67 and @xmath71gev@xmath67 is not as conclusive due to the smaller @xmath72 electric charge of the @xmath3-quark as well as the imprecise nature of the l3 data .",
    "there has been steady progress in calculating the @xmath73 production cross section at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "this was reported at this conference by langenfeld  @xcite , and since then in a recently published paper  @xcite , in which the cross section at the tevatron is used to determine the running top quark mass .",
    "the relevant formulae for the process @xmath74 are : @xmath75 @xmath76 here , @xmath77 is the centre - of - mass energy squared ( of the @xmath78 or @xmath79 colliding beams ) , @xmath80 is the partonic centre - of - mass energy squared , @xmath81 is the top quark ( pole ) mass , and @xmath82 is the parton luminosity function with the pdfs @xmath83 , evaluated at the factorisation scale @xmath84 .",
    "the functions @xmath85 are the hard partonic cross section and depend on the dimensionless variables @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the renormalisation scale .",
    "they have been solved in perturbation theory up to two loops .",
    "for @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath91 , one has @xmath92 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath85 on the scales @xmath84 and @xmath89 can be made explicit and the expressions can be seen in  @xcite . up to one loop , the results are known since long , and at the two - loop level , the corrections include the sudakov logarithms @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the @xmath95-quark velocity , @xmath96 , and terms with @xmath97 are included in @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( the leading term @xmath100 in @xmath101 ) , as well as the coulomb contributions @xmath102 . the subleading correction in the function @xmath103 has yet to be calculated . estimating it as @xmath104 in the nnlo contribution implies an uncertainty of @xmath105 pb at the lhc and @xmath106 pb at the tevatron .",
    "the rest of the uncertainties come from the pdfs , the scales @xmath84 and @xmath89 , @xmath107 and @xmath81 . for the pole mass @xmath108 gev , the @xmath73 cross sections at the lhc ( @xmath109 tev ) and the tevatron ( @xmath110 tev )",
    "are estimated ( for the mstw2008 pdfs  @xcite ) as follows  @xcite : @xmath111 @xmath112 for the cteq6.6 set of pdfs  @xcite , the central values of the cross section become 874 pb and 7.34 pb , for the lhc and the tevatron , respectively , with almost the same scale uncertainties as for the mstw2008 pdfs , but the pdf - related errors for this set are significantly larger , @xmath113 pb in @xmath114 and @xmath115 pb in @xmath116 , respectively . finally , using the well - known relation between the pole mass @xmath81 and the @xmath13 mass @xmath117 , and making the @xmath81-dependence in the total cross section manifest , a value @xmath118 gev for the @xmath13 top quark mass",
    "is obtained from the tevatron production cross section .      the cross section @xmath120 in the colour - singlet ( cs ) model at the nlo accuracy",
    "was calculated some time ago by krmer  @xcite and has been reconfirmed recently in @xcite , in which polarisation observables in photoproduction were also calculated at the nlo accuracy .",
    "these calculations have been compared with the published  @xcite and preliminary zeus data  @xcite and the results are summarised at this conference by artoisenet  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic matrix element @xmath121\\rangle$ ] was fixed from the analysis of the @xmath119-hadroproduction data and the cteq6 m pdf set  @xcite was used .",
    "the three main phenomenological parameters @xmath122 , the charm quark mass , and @xmath123 , the renormalisation and factorisation scales , were varied in the range @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "it was found that the cs yield at nlo accuracy underestimates the zeus data in both the @xmath8 and @xmath128-distributions , where @xmath129  a conclusion which is at variance with the observations made earlier  @xcite .",
    "the polarisation of @xmath119 is studied by analysing the angular distributions of the leptons originating from the decay @xmath130 . in terms of the polar and azimuthal angles @xmath131 and @xmath132 in the @xmath119 rest frame , one has @xmath133 where @xmath134 stands for either @xmath8 or @xmath128 .",
    "if the polar axis coincides with the spin quantisation axis , the quantities @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 can be related to the spin density matrix elements .",
    "the @xmath138 corrections in the cs model have a strong impact on the polarisation parameters @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which were analysed as functions of @xmath8 and @xmath128 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath140-distribution in nlo decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath8 and has a large negative value above @xmath141 gev , in contrast to the lo prediction , which is in reasonably good agreement with the data .",
    "the measurements of the parameter @xmath139 are , on the other hand , in better agreement with the nlo predictions ( compared to the lo cs model prediction ) , though the model uncertainties are too large for low @xmath128 values to draw a quantitative conclusion .    on a related issue , faccioli  @xcite summarised the experimental situation of @xmath119 polarisation from the fixed target ( e866 , hera - b ) to the collider energies ( cdf ) , observing that the magnitude and the `` sign '' of the measured @xmath119 polarisation crucially depends on the reference frame  @xcite .",
    "in particular , he showed that the seemingly contradictory data on the parameter @xmath140 from the experiments e866 , hera - b and cdf overlap as a function of the @xmath119 cms total momentum and the data can be consistently described , assuming that the most suitable axis for the measurement is along the direction of the relative motion of the colliding partons . in this ( collins - soper ) frame , polarisation changes from the longitudinal at small momentum to transverse at high momentum .",
    "this resolves the apparent @xmath119 polarisation puzzle among the experiments .",
    "however , the puzzle involving the theory ( based on nrqcd ) vs. experiment still persists . in conclusion , a quantitative understanding of the @xmath119-photoproduction data at hera is still lacking , calling for improved calculations within the nrqcd ( such as invoking colour - octet transitions and @xmath142 corrections to the cs model ) or perhaps the @xmath119 data are inviting a better theoretical framework .",
    "soft collinear effective theory is a case in point .",
    "a theoretical analysis of the production cross section and the spin alignment parameter @xmath143 in @xmath144 data from the d0 collaboration at the tevatron was presented by zotov  @xcite , with very similar conclusion , namely that the existing qcd framework is not in agreement with the data , in particular the distribution of @xmath143 as a function of @xmath8 is not understood .",
    "this will come under sharp scrutiny at the tevatron and certainly at the lhc .",
    "the saga of the successful predictions of the constituent quark model ( cqm ) continues !",
    "salient features of the @xmath3-baryon spectroscopy in this model were discussed and contrasted with the existing data by karliner  @xcite , with the conclusion that cqm ( with colour hyperfine interaction ) gives a highly accurate predictions for the heavy baryon masses .",
    "four examples from the @xmath3-baryon spectroscopy illustrate this : the measured mass difference by the cdf collaboration @xmath145 mev was predicted to be 194 mev ; the hyperfine splitting @xmath146 mev [ cdf ] is in agreement with the predicted value of 22 mev .",
    "likewise , the predictions for the masses , @xmath147 mev vs.  @xmath148 mev ( expt . ) , and @xmath149 mev , vs.  @xmath150 mev [ cdf ] , are in excellent agreement with data .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the measurement of the @xmath151 mass by cdf  @xcite differs from the first reported measurement of the @xmath152 mass by d0 , @xmath153 mev  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the aspect that the constituent quark masses in this model , in particular the mass difference @xmath154 used as input , depend on the spectator quarks , deserves further study .",
    "thus , the relation of the cqm with qcd , in which quark masses are universal , is far from obvious .",
    "the observation of the narrow state @xmath4 by belle , in the decay mode @xmath155 , with the @xmath156-mass spectrum peaking at 3872 mev , dominated by the state @xmath157 , as well as the radiative decay mode @xmath158 , measured by babar , has established @xmath4 as an exotic @xmath159 state .",
    "cdf and d0 confirmed the @xmath4 in @xmath79 collisions ( produced predominantly in prompt processes rather than in @xmath160 decays ) .",
    "in addition , the decay mode @xmath161 , which seems to have a similar branching ratio as the mode @xmath157 , implies large isospin violation , not typical of the usual strong interactions .",
    "the two leading hypotheses are that @xmath4 is a loosely bound `` hadronic molecule '' of the @xmath162 , since the mass of @xmath4 is so close to the @xmath162 threshold  @xcite , or that it is a point - like hadron , a tightly bound state of a diquark and an antidiquark , a tetraquark  @xcite .",
    "the drawback of the tetraquark picture is that it predicts a very rich spectroscopy .",
    "however , one has little understanding why a large number of these states have not been found .",
    "one of these predictions , namely the existence of related charged particles decaying into charmonium and pions , is still being debated .",
    "the molecular picture seems to be at odds with the large prompt production in hadronic collisions . at this conference ,",
    "polosa  @xcite presented a calculation for the production cross section of @xmath4 at the tevatron , assuming that @xmath4 is a loosely bound @xmath162 molecule .",
    "since then , this work has been published  @xcite and the main points are summarised here . using the cdf data on prompt @xmath4 production in the @xmath163 mode and the yield of @xmath164 , as well as the fraction of the prompt @xmath165 candidates , and assuming that the @xmath4 and @xmath165 have the same rapidity distribution in the range @xmath166 , a lower bound on the prompt production cross section @xmath167 of @xmath168 nb",
    "is obtained .",
    "this is contrasted with the estimates of an upper bound on the theoretical cross section , based on the assumption that @xmath4 is an s - wave bound state , @xmath169 : @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the relative 3-momentum between the @xmath172 and @xmath173 mesons .",
    "@xmath174 is a normalised wave function for the state @xmath4 , and @xmath175 is the region where @xmath176 is non - zero .",
    "the matrix element @xmath177 is calculated with the help of qcd @xmath178 matrix elements embedded in the fragmentation programme , pythia and herwig . with the binding energy @xmath179 mev",
    ", the characteristic size @xmath180 of the molecule is estimated as @xmath181 fm , yielding for @xmath182 a number @xmath183 mev , where @xmath184 is the reduced mass . applying the uncertainty principle yields a gaussian momentum spread @xmath185 mev . alternatively , @xmath182 is of the order of the centre of mass momentum , @xmath186 mev . with this , the integration region",
    "is restricted to a ball @xmath175 of radius @xmath187 $ ] mev .",
    "herwig then yields an upper limit of @xmath188 nb on @xmath167 and the corresponding number for pythia is @xmath189 nb .",
    "this is typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the measured cross section by cdf , disfavouring the molecular interpretation of @xmath4 .",
    "the tevatron is today the only environment where all species of heavy flavours ( hf ) are studied .",
    "the cdf and d0 experiments pursue a rich and diverse hf program that is reaching maturity , owing to samples of @xmath79 collisions in excess of 5 fb@xmath36 per experiment , expected to double by 2011 .",
    "this suggests a few years of intense and fruitful competition with next generation experiments that will soon start their operations at the lhc .",
    "r0.5        with thousands of top - quark decays collected , tevatron top physics entered the realm of precision  @xcite . using 2.8 fb@xmath36",
    "cdf reported the single most precise @xmath73 production cross section measurement , @xmath190 pb ; the 8% relative uncertainty challenges the precision of most recent theory predictions , and is achieved by normalising the @xmath73 to the @xmath191 cross section thus cancelling the leading systematic uncertainty from the luminosity of the sample . d0 reports a result , combined through 14 independent channels , of @xmath192 pb using 0.9 fb@xmath36 .",
    "while measurements of @xmath73 strong production are an important test of perturbative qcd , electroweak ( single ) top - quark production determines directly the magnitude of the @xmath193 quark - mixing matrix element , probes the @xmath3quark pdf of the proton , is sensitive to fourth generation models , and is ultimately a key testing ground for higgs searches in the _ wh _ associated production channel .",
    "both experiments reported @xmath194 observation of this process using 2.3 ( d0 ) and 3.2 ( cdf ) fb@xmath36 . because of the tiny signal - to - background ratio , use of advanced machine - learning techniques is required , whose performance is carefully validated in multiple control samples . the measured cross sections , @xmath195 pb ( cdf ) and @xmath196 pb ( d0 ) , yield the values @xmath197 ( cdf ) and @xmath198 ( d0 ) .",
