    "european option prices are usually quoted in terms of the corresponding implied volatility , and over the last decade a large number of papers ( both from practitioners and academics ) has focused on understanding its behaviour and characteristics .",
    "the most important directions have been towards ( i ) understanding the behaviour of the implied volatility in a given model ( see  @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite for instance ) and ( ii ) deciphering its behaviour in a model - independent way , as in  @xcite , @xcite or  @xcite . these results have provided us with a set of tools and methods to check whether a given parameterisation is free of arbitrage or not . in particular , given a set of observed data ( say european calls and puts for different strikes and maturities ) , it is of fundamental importance to determine a methodology ensuring that both interpolation and extrapolation of this data are also arbitrage - free .",
    "such approaches have been carried out for instance in  @xcite , in  @xcite and in  @xcite .",
    "several parameterisations of the implied volatility surface have now become popular , in particular  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite , albeit not ensuring absence of arbitrage .    in the recent paper  @xcite , gatheral and",
    "jacquier proposed a new class of svi implied volatility parameterisation , based on the previous works of gatheral  @xcite .",
    "in particular they provide explicit sufficient and  in a certain sense  almost necessary conditions ensuring that such a surface is free of arbitrage .",
    "we shall recall later the exact definition of arbitrage , and see that it can be decomposed into butterfly arbitrage and calendar spread arbitrage .",
    "this new class depends on the maturity and can hence be used to model the whole volatility surface , and not a single slice .",
    "it also depends on the at - the - money total implied variance @xmath0 , and on a positive function @xmath1 such that the total variance  @xmath2 as a function of time - to - maturity @xmath3 and log-(forward)-moneyness @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the classical ( normalised ) svi parameterisation from  @xcite , and  @xmath7 an asymmetry parameter ( essentially playing the role of the correlation between spot and volatility in stochastic volatility models ) .    in this work ,",

    ". we obtain ( sections  [ sec_cal ] and  [ sec_butter ] ) necessary and sufficient conditions coupling the functions  @xmath10 and  @xmath1 that preclude arbitrage .",
    "this allows us to obtain ( i ) the exact set of admissible functions @xmath1 in the symmetric ( @xmath11 ) svi case , and ( ii ) a constraint - free parameterisation of gatheral - jacquier functions satisfying the conditions of  @xcite . in passing ( section  [ sec : nonsmooth ] )",

    "even though the operator does not act on the second component of the function , we keep this notation for clarity . with the usual notations from the black - scholes formula : @xmath40 , this leads to the definition of butterfly arbitrage  ( * ? ? ? * definition 2.3 ) :    [ def : butterfly0 ] for any @xmath15 , the volatility surface @xmath41 is free of butterfly arbitrage if the corresponding density @xmath42 is non - negative .",
    "it is indeed well - known ( under suitable differentiability assumptions ) that the second derivative ( with respect to the strike ) of the call price function gives the density of the stock price ( see  @xcite for details ) .",

    "therefore absence of static arbitrage implies that both the numerator and the denominator are non - negative quantities . the extra condition ( from absence of buttefly arbitrage )",

    "the following lemma however shows that other asymptotic behaviours of  @xmath49 and  @xmath50 hold in full generality .",
