    "the universal extra dimension ( ued ) model , or models as there are already quite a few interesting variants of the minimal one , has a flat metric ( like add ) and a small compactification radius of @xmath0(tev@xmath1 ) ( like rs ) . also , this is the most democratic extra dimension ( ed ) model in the sense that all standard model ( sm ) fields can propagate in the extra dimension , or bulk .",
    "thus , in essence , it is quite similar to the first - generation ed models of kaluza and klein @xcite .",
    "however , the motivations are quite different .",
    "the cons first : this does not solve the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "both add and rs models lower the planck mass , as seen on our brane , by two very different but very elegant mechanisms .",
    "ued does nothing of that sort ; in fact , we will see that the model breathes more freely when we do not include gravity .",
    "issues like the stabilisation of the radius of the extra dimension are not addressed .",
    "if you think that the fine - tuning of the higgs mass is the most serious issue in particle physics , you will probably not turn to this model .",
    "now the pros .",
    "first , the dark matter .",
    "the dark matter provides almost one - fourth of the energy density of the universe , and ued , among all extra dimensional models , supplies a very good candidate for the cold dark matter ( cdm ) . in fact , it is the most theoretically motivated candidate  _",
    "e.g. _ , in supersymmetry , we impose the conservation of r - parity by hand and get the neutralino dark matter ; but the ued dark matter is a necessary consequence of the formulation .",
    "second , the dark matter constraint and the indirect limits on the compactification radius guarantee a spectrum that is completely within the reach of lhc .",
    "the first excited states of the sm particles should be between 400 - 900 gev .",
    "as has been pointed out , the collider signals mimic those of supersymmetry ; so this is probably the most serious case of the so - called lhc inverse problem  the discrimination of susy and ued from signals .",
    "in fact , i will discuss the issue of discriminating ued from other np models too , not confining only to r - parity conserving susy .",
    "ued scores more positive points if one considers two extra dimensions .",
    "as i will touch upon later , the 6-d ued model answers two very important questions : why proton lifetime is so large ?",
    "( this is one of the most challenging problems in the extra dimensional models . )",
    "why there are three generations ?",
    "the plan is as follows : i will discuss , in the subsequent sections , ( i ) formulation , ( ii ) indirect bounds , ( iii ) collider search prospects , and discrimination from other models , most notably supersymmetry , ( iv ) astrophysical bounds , and inclusion of gravity , and ( v ) ued with two extra dimensions . except for the last part , i will concentrate on the minimal version of ued .",
    "there are at least three other talks that will focus on several interesting features of the model : the phenomenology of the scalar sector of minimal ued @xcite and of 6-d ued @xcite , and the power - law evolution of the gauge couplings in ued @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of appelquist , cheng , and dobrescu @xcite is very simple : apart from four large dimensions @xmath2 , there is a small dimension @xmath3 ( this i will call the bulk ) , which is compactified on a circle of radius @xmath4 .",
    "the points @xmath3 and @xmath5 are identified .",
    "this means that the momentum along the fifth direction , @xmath6 , is discrete : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is any integer . just like particle in a box , there will be equispaced states , whose masses are given by m_n^2 = m_0 ^ 2 + n^2/r^2 , [ kktree ] where the last term comes from @xmath9 .",
    "the integer @xmath8 is called the kaluza - klein ( kk ) number ; @xmath10 corresponds to the zero mode . _",
    "every sm particle is associated with an equispaced tower of particles of identical quantum numbers .",
    "_ as all particles can access the bulk , momentum along the fifth dimension , and hence @xmath8 , is conserved in any process .",
    "thus , ( i ) all @xmath11 particles are to be pair produced in collider experiments ; particle decaying into two @xmath12 particles , kk number is conserved .",
    "note that while performing the fourier expansion of the 5-d field , we summed over all _ positive _ integers only .",
    "fields with negative @xmath8 are identical in all respect with fields with positive @xmath8 .",
    "so , while considering the kk - number conservation , one should consider both choices : @xmath13 .",
    "if one of the combination fits , that s fine . the complexity arose because kk - number is an additive quantum number and not a multiplicative one like r - parity . ]",
    "( ii ) the lightest particle for each @xmath8 level is stable .",
    "note that if @xmath14 is of the order of a few hundred gev , the particles for each @xmath15 level are quasi - degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy is somewhat lifted by the radiative corrections @xcite .    in the minimal 5d ued model ,",
    "the fermions are necessarily vectorial , even in their zero modes .",
    "this can simply be guessed from the fact that @xmath16 is a part of the @xmath17-matrix set itself : @xmath18 .",
    "to get chiral fermions in zero mode , we need a further @xmath19 orbifolding , so that the compactified dimension becomes @xmath20 .",
    "this is nothing but a fold of the circle along one of its diameters and identification of the points @xmath3 and @xmath21 for @xmath22 ( remember that there is already the identification of @xmath23 ) .",
    "fields can be even or odd under this @xmath19 : the higgs field , the first four components of the gauge fields , the right - chiral component of su(2 ) singlet fermions , and left - chiral components of su(2 ) doublet fermions are all even , while the fifth component of the gauge fields , the left - chiral component of su(2 ) singlet fermions , and right - chiral components of su(2 ) doublet fermions are all odd .",
    "the 5d fields can be fourier expanded as _ + ( x^,y ) & = & _ + ^(0)(x^ ) + _ n=1^ _ + ^(n ) ( x^ ) , + _",
    "-(x^,y ) & = & _ n=1^ _ -^(n ) ( x^ ) , where @xmath24 is even and @xmath25 is odd under @xmath19 .",
    "fields which are odd under the @xmath19 orbifold symmetry do not have zero modes .",
    "only even fields have zero modes , which are identified with the sm particles .",
    "there are two fixed points on the orbifold that are mapped onto themselves : @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the even and odd fields satisfy @xmath28 and @xmath29 at the fixed points .",
    "there are two types of radiative corrections to eq .",
    "( [ kktree ] ) .",
    "the first , called the bulk correction , comes from the fact that the theory is not lorentz invariant ( @xmath3 is different from @xmath2 ) and therefore the wavefunction renormalization @xmath30 for the large dimensions is not equal to @xmath31 , that for the fifth dimension .",
    "this correction , proportional to @xmath32 , occurs for loops that can sense the compactification ( _ i.e. _ , if we flatten out the ed the loop definitely vanishes ) ; it is in general small and zero for fermions .",
    "while an exact expression is available in @xcite , these corrections are subdominant in the determination of the spectrum .",
    "the second correction is called the orbifold correction .",
    "this is in general log - divergent . in the presence of the @xmath20 orbifolding",
    ", the translational invariance along @xmath3 is lost .",
    "however , there is a discrete @xmath19 symmetry , different from the earlier @xmath19 , of @xmath33 which is still intact .",
    "the conservation of kk - number @xmath8 breaks down to the conservation of kk - parity , defined as @xmath34 , which is a result of this second @xmath19 .",
    "thus , ( i ) @xmath12 particles are to be produced in pairs while @xmath35 particles can be singly produced ; ( ii ) the lightest @xmath12 particle , often called the lightest kk particle ( lkp ) , is the only stable @xmath36 particle .",
    "this turns out to be an excellent cdm candidate .",
    "in fact , this is completely analogous to the @xmath19 symmetry of the underlying theory leading to a dark matter candidate for r - parity conserving supersymmetry and the little higgs model with t - parity conservation .    there are terms located on the fixed points that receive large log - divergent contributions .",
    "one must include such terms to have a consistent theory .",
    "particles flowing in the loop , which conserves kk number at all vertices .",
    "however , this vertex is in general divergent . to cancel this divergence",
    ", one needs a divergent term itself in the original lagrangian . ] to regulate these terms , one introduces a cut - off , @xmath37 , upto which the theory is said to be valid ; hence the corrections come as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , the regularisation scale , may be taken to be @xmath40 for @xmath8-th level particles .",
    "@xmath37 should be at least of the order of @xmath14 ; phenomenologically , one takes @xmath41 to be upto 50 or 100 .",
    "the finite parts of these corrections are undetermined and remain as free parameters of the theory ; one may take , as a simplifying assumption , the finite parts to vanish at the cutoff scale @xmath37 ( that is one of the principal assumptions of the minimal ued ) .",
    "thus , the orbifold corrections are of the form f(g_i ) , where @xmath42 is a function depending upon the gauge couplings @xmath43 under which the field transforms nontrivially . for the exact expressions ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "note that just like any ed model , ued is nonrenormalisable and should be treated as an effective theory valid upto the cutoff scale .",
    "the following points are worth remembering :    * the radiative corrections are positive .",
    "therefore , the doublet quarks , which are nonsinglet under all three sm gauge groups , receive the maximum correction . the su(2 ) singlet leptons ( whose zero mode is right - chiral but excitations are vectorial , with the @xmath19-even component being right - chiral ) receive the minimum shift and are closest to the tree - level mass as given in eq .  ( [ kktree ] ) .",
    "* while the vectorial mass terms @xmath40 and the radiative corrections do not couple su(2 ) singlet and doublet fermions , the yukawa term does .",
    "this is significant only for the top quark and hence the @xmath12 top quark masses differ from their other charge @xmath44 counterparts .",
    "* the gauge fields have five components .",
    "the first four , which are even under @xmath19 , appear as the excited gauge boson .",
    "the fifth component is a @xmath19-odd scalar .",
    "this mixes with the excitations of the higgs doublet with the same quantum numbers .",
    "for example , the fifth component of @xmath45 mixes with the excitation of the charged goldstone . out of the two states ,",
    "one is eaten up by the @xmath12 gauge boson ( the higgs mechanism for the excited level ) , while the other one remains in the physical spectrum . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the physical particle is almost the excitation of the @xmath10 higgs field .",
    "thus , there are four @xmath12 scalars : @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( the excitation of the sm higgs boson ) , and @xmath49 ( the excitation of the neutral cp - odd goldstone ) .",
    "the hierarchy @xmath50 is fixed , but the spacing depends , among other factors , on the sm higgs mass @xmath51 .",
    "there is one more term , @xmath52 , a soft term located only at the fixed points , that affects _ only _ the scalar spectrum . in the minimal ued , @xmath52 is taken to be zero .",
    "more detailed phenomenology of the scalar sector may be found in @xcite and also in the talk @xcite .",
    "* at the @xmath12 level , @xmath53 and @xmath54 mix to give the physical states @xmath55 and @xmath56 . however , the weinberg angle @xmath57 is very small , almost close to zero , so that @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the latter is almost always the lkp .",
    "if one includes gravity , the graviton becomes the lkp for @xmath60 gev . also , for very heavy sm higgs , the excited charged higgs @xmath47 may turn out to be the lkp , which in any way is cosmologically not viable .",
    "_ since @xmath56 is neutral and weakly interacting , this is an excellent cdm candidate .",
    "_ as this is the end product of the cascade of any @xmath12 state , the ued signal at the colliders , at least for the production of @xmath12 states , is comparatively soft sm particles or jets and _ large missing energy _",
    "carried away by the lkp .",
    "all sm particles have their corresponding towers .",
    "thus , we expect finite radiative corrections from these heavy degrees of freedom on low - energy observables , over and above the sm effects .",
    "we mention several such observables and corresponding bounds on @xmath14 . unlike collider signals ,",
    "these effects are not sensitive to the precise value of the cutoff scale @xmath37 .",
    "ued is a minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) model .",
    "such models are characterised by the fact that there are no new cp violating phases apart from the one present in the ckm matrix , which , in its @xmath61 form , is still unitary , and no new fcnc operators apart from those occurring in the sm .",
    "mfv - type models include two - higgs doublet model , supergravity with small @xmath62 and no new sources of fcnc ( aligned quark and squark mass matrices ) , gauge mediated susy , little higgs with t - parity , _",
    "et cetera_.    the new physics ( np ) contribution to any mfv model is severely restricted . from the direct and indirect measurements of the sides and angles of the unitarity triangle ( ut )",
    ", one can construct a so - called universal unitarity triangle , valid for all mfv - type models .",
    "the predictions are very close to that of the sm ; for example , @xmath63 , and the tip of the ut @xmath64 , @xmath65 , where the numbers in parenthesis are those for the sm .",
    "thus , just from cp - violating observables , it is almost impossible to detect any evidence of any mfv - type model",
    ".    one can have excited gauge bosons , charged higgs , and quarks , inside the loop for the box diagram of @xmath66-@xmath67 mixing .",
    "this contributes to the mass difference @xmath68 between the @xmath69 mass eigenstates . while there are potentially infinite number of diagrams , coming from all @xmath8 upto infinity , it is enough to truncate the series at , say , @xmath37",
    "also , for minimal ued , the result after such a truncation is finite and convergent . from the measured value of @xmath68 , the lower bound of @xmath14 is about 250 - 300 gev @xcite .",
    "a similar consideration applies for the partial width of @xmath30 to a @xmath70 final state ; the limit is roughly 300 gev @xcite .",
    "a rather strong constraint comes from the radiative decay @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the experimental number for the branching fraction is @xmath72 , where the first error is a combination of staistical and systematic errors , the second one comes from the uncertainties in the energy extrapolation , and the third one is due to the subtraction of @xmath73 events .",
    "the theoretical number , within the framework of sm and at the nnlo level , is @xmath74 .",
    "the uncertainties include higher order perturbative effects , hadronic power corrections , parametric dependences , and the uncertainty in the charm - quark mass .",
    "while the numbers agree at about 1.1@xmath75 level , any model , like minimal ued , that decreases the branching ratio , is forced to be very tightly constrained .",
    "for example , haisch and weiler @xcite found @xmath76 gev at 95% cl .",
    "the calculation , however , takes the ued at lo for the matching of the corresponding wilson coefficients ; two - loop effects with ued are yet to be computed .",
    "the fact , together with the 99% cl bound , still keeps open a lower value of @xmath77 gev , which may be interesting for a future generation @xmath78 machine .",
    "the last indirect bound comes from the oblique parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the precision electroweak studies constrain @xmath81 gev for a light sm higgs at about 115 gev",
    ". however , this bound is strongly sensitive on the sm higs mass ; for example , a 300 gev higgs will keep @xmath82 gev open .",
    "the bound is also mildly sensitive to the top mass .",
    "the role of colliders to investigate the possible nature of spacetime was highlighted by antoniadis @xcite .",
    "i will not say much about the tevatron bounds as they have been superceded by the indirect constraints .",
    "the lhc , however , is a different story . as we will see later",
    ", @xmath14 has a theoretically motivated upper bound of about 0.9 - 1 tev , from dark matter abundance .",
    "thus , the entire parameter space is accessible to lhc ; if ued is there , at least in its minimal version , the @xmath12 excitations are definitely going to be observed at the lhc @xcite .    as the lkp is stable due to the underlying @xmath19 symmetry",
    ", this will be the end product of the decay cascade of any @xmath12 particle that may be produced .",
    "the lkp escapes the detector , so all ued signals will necessarily have large missing energy and transverse momentum . the near - degeneracy of the @xmath12 level forces the visible particles or jets to be comparatively soft .",
    "however , they should be visible unless coming from a transition between very close levels ; _",
    "e.g. _ , the @xmath83s coming from @xmath84 are going to be very soft and will probably be below the acceptance level of the detectors , so their detection would be a challenge at the lhc .    it has been pointed out in @xcite that the signals for ued , whether they be soft leptons or jets accompanied by large missing @xmath85 , can effectively be faked by other np models , most notably by supersymmetry with r - parity conservation .",
    "for example , by replacing excited quarks and leptons by squarks and sleptons , excited gauge bosons by corresponding gauginos , and lkp by the lightest neutralino , the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , one can mimic all signals of ued by susy .",
    "one of the possible discriminants at the lhc would have been to determine the spin of the new particle , but in the unclean environment of a hadron collider , this is a very tough job @xcite .",
    "another option could be the production of @xmath35 gauge bosons , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , in @xmath88-channel .",
    "there are no analogues of these bosons in susy , and so they may be thought of as the ` smoking gun ' of ued .",
    "however , this question is subtle and we will return to it later .",
    "here , one may note that they can be singly produced as @xmath88-channel resonances , and hence do not require more energy than that needed for the pair production of @xmath12 states .",
    "thus , if the collider is energetic enough to pair produce @xmath12 states , it should produce @xmath35 resonances too .",
    "i have discussed earlier that there must be terms located at the fixed points @xmath89 that go as @xmath38 for the uv completion of the theory .",
    "they reduce the conservation of kk - number to the conservation of kk - parity , @xmath34 .",
    "thus , terms where an @xmath35 gauge boson is coupled to two @xmath10 fermions are allowed ; the coupling is small , suppressed by the boundary - to - bulk ratio , but strong enough to produce the @xmath35 gauge bosons . while the signal of @xmath87 may be observed as a sharp bump in the dilepton channel ( these bosons , in turn , decay mostly into two @xmath10 fermions , so there is no missing energy ) , @xmath86 will go unobserved .",
    "this is because @xmath86 couples almost entirely to @xmath10 quark pairs , and a dijet signal with no missing energy is definitely going to be swamped in the lhc environment .",
    "this is where a next - generation @xmath78 collider , like the international linear collider ( ilc ) , may come to our rescue .",
    "this is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "an important byproduct is the enhancement of the higgs production rate at the lhc .",
    "this goes mostly through gluon - gluon fusion , and with ued in the picture , there is an excited top triangle that adds to the sm amplitude . for @xmath90 gev and @xmath91",
    ", this enhancement can be as high as 80% @xcite .",
    "the international linear collider is still in the blueprint stage .",
    "this is going to be a single - pass linear collider , with two densely packed beams of electron and positron hitting each other .",
    "the initial centre - of - mass energy should be 500 gev , an with sufficient motivation ( read discovery of new particles at the lhc ) it can be upgraded to 1 tev .",
    "ilc will provide a clean environment .",
    "this fact has motivated a number of studies of ued at the ilc @xcite .",
    "let me just highlight the major points .",
    "* ilc can discriminate between ued and susy .",
    "one just needs to look at the differential decay distributions of the final - state electrons in @xmath92 @xcite or muons in @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "for example , the distribution of @xmath94 plus missing energy dips at @xmath95 for ued and peaks there for susy ( the total number of events will also be different ) .",
    "+ * ilc can act as a factory for production of the @xmath35 gauge bosons @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xcite , in the same vein as lep-1 which was a @xmath30-factory .",
    "if ilc sits on one of these resonances , the production cross - section can be tens of picobarns .",
    "this , however , needs a prior knowledge of at least the approximate positions of the peaks , which should be available from the lhc , and planning the ilc design accordingly .",
    "unfortunately , ilc has predetermined centre - of - mass energies that it will operate in , and it may be too late to change that in view of the lhc data . *",
    "one can still salvage the situation and use the ilc to observe the narrow @xmath35 resonances , even if they are away from the machine @xmath96 .",
    "this is because the beam energy is degraded by the qed processes of initial state radiation ( isr ) and beamstrahlung ; in both the cases , one or more photons is radiated off the incoming particles so that the effective cm energy is less , and there is a possibility that it will hit the resonance .",
    "this is nothing but the phenomenon of radiative return , already observed in lep-1.5 . while the luminosities fall",
    "as we go away from the cm energy , the much enhanced cross - section at the resonance ensures that the signal is still visible @xcite . to observe such signals , ilc upgrade running at @xmath97 tev will be required ; a higher energy machine , like the proposed clic , will probe further in the parameter space . + * while it has been established that ued can successfully be discriminated from r - parity conserving susy at the ilc , the issue of discrimination from other models should also be investigated .",
    "for example , r - parity violating susy , with nonzero @xmath98 and @xmath99-type couplings , can show @xmath88-channel peaks from sneutrino resonances , which are analogous to the @xmath35 resonances .",
    "such peaks can be observed from rs gravitons , or one or more extra @xmath100s .",
    "+ it has been shown in @xcite that a simultaneous study of dijets and 4 lepton plus missing energy signals can act as a useful discriminator .",
    "the latter signal can come , in ued , from the process @xmath101 . depending on the value of @xmath37",
    ", the dijet invariant mass distribution may show both @xmath86 and @xmath87 peaks , or they may be fused into one .",
    "whatever the case might be , a sharp excess over the sm background is expected .",
    "the @xmath102 plus missing energy signal also shows an excess .",
    "since all the leptons are expected to be soft , one can look for leptons , none of whose @xmath85 should exceed 40 gev .",
    "this reduces the sm background to a negligible value ; also , other competing models would give very different distributions ( for example , in a left - right symmetric model with extra @xmath103 and @xmath100 , we do not expect soft leptons ) .",
    "thus , a simultaneous study of both these signals in the so - called signature space of the lhc should give an unambiguous map to the multi - model parameter space .",
    "the best motivation of ued is , perhaps , a strong candidate for the cold dark matter , viz . ,",
    "the lkp , which is mostly @xmath104 , the excitation of the hypercharge gauge boson .",
    "this is neutral and weakly interacting , and over a very large part of the parameter space , is the lightest @xmath12 particle ( a small portion may have the @xmath12 charged higgs as the lkp , but being charged , that is not a good cdm candidate ) .",
    "the kk excitations , and hence the lkp , were freely produced and annihilated in the early universe , where @xmath105 . as the universe expands and cools , the lkp decouples and freezes out , and forms a thermal relic .",
    "the number density of the lkp can be estimated using the boltzmann equation , and the lkp self - annihilation rate , whose cross - section is roughly @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the @xmath108 coupling constant @xcite .",
    "the most accurate result is the one quoted in the last reference of @xcite .",
    "the relic abundance has been measured by wmap to be @xmath109 @xcite , which translates roughly to a window between 850 and 900 gev for the lkp . if the cdm is not entirely due to the lkp , the lower limit may be relaxed , but the upper limit should be about @xmath110 gev .",
    "this is the result that makes us confident about the discovery of ued , provided it is the path nature takes , at the lhc",
    ".    there may be other species of @xmath12 particles close to the lkp .",
    "the best candidates for this are the excited leptons and neutrinos .",
    "if they are sufficiently close , their effects on co - annihilation should be taken into account .",
    "the closer they are , the tighter is the upper bound on @xmath14 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "all in all , one can say that the parameter space of ued should conservatively be in the range 400 gev@xmath111 900 gev . for a more detailed review",
    ", i would suggest ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if one includes gravity in ued , place must be provided for the kk excitations of gravitons , whose @xmath8-th level should be simply at @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 graviton immediately becomes the lkp upto @xmath112 gev , above which the radiative corrections on @xmath56 push it below @xmath113 .",
    "however , the graviton lkp scenario is not viable . in the graviton lkp region",
    ", @xmath56 decays to @xmath113 and a photon .",
    "the contribution of this process to the diffuse photon flux is much above the experimental limit , ruling the graviton scenario out .",
    "if one includes gravity , there is a small patch of the parameter space , with @xmath114 gev , where @xmath56 is the lkp and still does not violate the dark matter overproduction constraint .",
    "the @xmath12 excitations should be observable at the lhc but the ilc , even with the upgraded @xmath115 tev option , will draw a blank .",
    "the model also becomes rather fine - tuned and loses much of its charm as far as the collider search is concerned .",
    "the 6-d ued , where there are two extra dimensions accessible to the sm particles , has some strong phenomenological motivations .",
    "it is well - known that the proton stability is a problematic issue in any extra dimensional scenario , because of the new higher dimensional operators that may lead to an unacceptably quick decay of the proton . in 6-d ued , the global symmetries of the theory prevents all proton decay operators less than dimension 9 @xcite .",
    "for example , the decay @xmath116 has a lifetime of @xmath117 years for @xmath118 gev and @xmath119 , and scales as @xmath120 and @xmath121 !",
    "it was shown in @xcite that an @xmath122 global gauge anomaly exists unless the number of @xmath19-even doublets differ from that of @xmath19-odd doublets by an integral multiple of six .",
    "for each generation , this difference is either 2 or 4 ; thus , one needs three generations ( or a multiple of three ) for the anomaly cancellation .    to get chiral fermions ,",
    "the 6-d ued needs to be compactified on a chiral square @xcite .",
    "this is a square with adjacent sides identified .",
    "each sm particle has excitations specified by two positive integers @xmath123 , so that the mass of the @xmath123-th excitation , at the tree - level , is given by m_j , k^2 = m_0 ^ 2 + .    the scalar sector of 6-d ued is richer than its 5-d counterpart .",
