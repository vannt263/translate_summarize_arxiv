    "these definitions are equivalent to lower bounds for the bakry - emery tensor provided @xmath6 is exact . for diffusion operators where @xmath6 is not necessarily exact such a geometric picture was missing .",
    "though the operator @xmath8 yields a bilinear form , in general this form is not symmetric and therefore can not arise as dirichlet form of a metric measure space .",

    "the results are very similar to properties that one derives for symmetric operators with lower bounded ricci curvature , e.g. @xcite . in this article",
    "we derive a geometric picture associated to the diffusion operator @xmath20 for general @xmath1-forms @xmath12 in the spirit of the work by lott , sturm and villani .",

    "we prove several geometric consequences : generalized bishop - gromov estimates , pre - compactness under gromov - hausdorff convergence , and a generalized bonnet - myers theorem .",

    "we introduce the notion of @xmath32-flows that arise naturally on generalized smooth metric measure spaces together with a @xmath1-form satisfying a curvature - dimension condition .",
