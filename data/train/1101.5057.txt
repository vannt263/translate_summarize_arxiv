    "the factorization theorems of pqcd have been instrumental in the successful application of qcd theory to phenomenology . the standard collinear factorization formalism  @xcite makes use of `` integrated '' pdfs and ffs which depend only on a single longitudinal momentum fraction , while the small momentum components , including the _ transverse _ components , are integrated over in the definitions .",
    "the integrated pdfs and ffs have consistent operator definitions in qcd , with appealing interpretations in terms of parton model concepts .",
    "however , the standard collinear factorization formalism relies on approximations that are only valid for sufficiently inclusive observables .",
    "in order to address many of the issues now at the forefront of research in qcd and its role in hadron structure , pqcd factorization must be extended to situations where the usual approximations are not appropriate .",
    "a transverse momentum dependent _ tmd - factorization _ formalism goes beyond the standard factorization framework by allowing the pdfs and ffs to depend on intrinsic transverse momentum in addition to the usual momentum fraction variables . as such , different sets of approximations",
    "are needed in the factorization proofs .",
    "the pdfs and ffs in a tmd - factorization formalism are referred to as tmd pdfs and tmd ffs ( they are also called `` unintegrated '' or `` @xmath0-dependent '' ) to distinguish them from the more familiar integrated correlation functions of collinear factorization .",
    "henceforth , we will refer to tmd pdfs and tmd ffs collectively as `` tmds '' .",
    "the role of the intrinsic transverse momentum carried by partons in high energy collisions is becoming increasingly central in discussions of how to probe the details of hadronic structure in high energy collisions .",
    "the usefulness of the tmd concept is evident from the large variety of situations where it makes an appearance .",
    "generally , tmd - factorization is needed to describe processes that are sensitive to intrinsic parton transverse momentum .",
    "the drell - yan ( dy ) process , single - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , and back - to - back hadron production in electron - positron annihilation at small transverse momentum are all classic examples of where tmd - factorization formulae are frequently used .",
    "more recently , tmd pdfs and",
    "ffs have been under intense study as objects that carry information about the spin structure of hadrons ; the boer - mulders , sivers , and pretzelosity functions are all specific examples of tmd pdfs , while the collins function is an example of a tmd ff .",
    "for a recent review of tmds in spin physics , see ref .",
    "@xcite . in very high energy ( small-@xmath1 ) resummation physics , where there is a lack of @xmath0-ordering , the tmd gluon distribution is especially important , and",
    "similar issues must be dealt with .",
    "finally , tmd functions are useful tools in the construction of monte carlo event generators , where the details of final state kinematics are of interest .",
    "while tmds can potentially provide a much deeper understanding of qcd and hadron structure , the theoretical framework of tmd - factorization is much more complicated than the more standard collinear factorization . in derivations of collinear factorization",
    ", there are important cancellations that occur _ after _ integrations of parton momentum are carried out . with tmd - factorization ,",
    "the integrals over parton transverse momentum are left undone in the definitions of the tmds , and contributions that would ordinarily cancel in a collinear factorization treatment must be accounted for .",
    "collins , soper and sterman ( css ) constructed a tmd - factorization formalism  @xcite that deals with the main complications of transverse momentum dependence , and provides a systematic treatment of pqcd over the full range of transverse momentum .",
    "the css formalism has proven highly successful in specific phenomenological applications such as in the calculation of the transverse momentum distributions in dy processes ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) , and is also well - suited for the production of back - to - back particles in @xmath2 annihilation .",
    "the same methods are needed for the discovery of new particles like the standard model higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , extensions of the css tmd - factorization formalism have been derived for sidis  @xcite , and including spin in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , the most common methods for applying the css formalism are not ideally suited for studies that are specifically oriented toward understanding the tmd pdfs and tmd ffs themselves .",
    "furthermore , the relationship between the full pqcd treatment of factorization and parton - model intuition has remained much less clear in tmd - factorization than in collinear factorization .",
    "this has led to considerable confusion about how the study of tmds should be approached in pqcd .",
    "that confusion is especially apparent from a comparison between current applications of tmd - factorization and collinear factorization : while there have been extensive programs dedicated to parametrizing and evolving the integrated pdfs and ffs ( making them indispensable and portable tools for phenomenology ) , a generally agreed upon framework for dealing with tmds in an analogous way has not yet been established .",
    "more disturbingly , there has been a persistent lack of clarity or agreement regarding the definitions of the tmds .",
    "a suitable set of definitions must be dictated by the requirements of factorization and universality , but the most common and naive definitions lead to inconsistencies , including unphysical divergences .    over roughly the past decade , there has been steady progress toward a better understanding of what is needed  @xcite .",
    "the issue of finding the right definitions has now been especially brought into focus by the recent work of collins  @xcite . the definitions for the tmds in ref .",
    "@xcite are uniquely determined by the requirements of factorization , maximal universality , and internal consistency .",
    "( by `` maximal universality '' we mean that the same correlation functions appear in a large number of processes . )",
    "the confusion over definitions therefore appears to be solved . with the new definitions ,",
    "the implementation of evolution via the css formalism is not modified significantly from earlier treatments which means that existing parametrizations of the non - perturbative parts can still be used .",
    "however , they can now be understood as contributions to separate , qcd - evolved tmds . moreover , as we will discuss in the next two sections , the new definitions have a much more direct relationship with more intuitive , parton model based ways of viewing tmd - factorization .",
    "there has been much recent work devoted to parametrizing tmds by assuming a parton model picture of tmd - factorization and directly fitting cross section calculations to experimental data  @xcite .",
    "this approach to tmd phenomenology is often called the _ generalized parton model _ ( gpm )  @xcite .    in addition , by working with non - perturbative models , it is possible to study the general properties of the tmds and their relationships with each other .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for an overview of this subject . )",
    "a famous example is the illustration via model calculation that the sivers function is non - vanishing in sidis  @xcite .    however , most efforts to parametrize or model tmds , particularly the spin - dependent tmds , have ignored the role of evolution . for the unpolarized tmd pdfs",
    "there have been detailed implementations of evolution ( e.g.  @xcite ) however , even in the unpolarized case , the identification of the separate evolved tmds and their relationship with the fundamental definitions in a complete treatment of factorization has remained unclear .",
    "the main purpose of the present article is to initiate the process of consistently including qcd evolution in parametrizations and models of tmds by following the definitions in ref .",
    "addressing evolution is now an especially pressing task , given the very wide range of energy scales set to be probed in experiments in the near future , from jefferson lab ( jlab ) to the lhc .",
    "it has already been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that evolution ( in the form of sudakov suppression ) should be expected to be large . in our analysis",
    ", we will illustrate how this follows from the evolution of the individual tmds .",
    "we also aim to facilitate the future implementation of evolution in studies of tmds by clarifying the relationship between the parton model description of tmd - factorization and the css formalism . to this end",
    ", we have made computations available at  @xcite that illustrate how to obtain evolved tmds given a choice of non - perturbative starting input .",
    "an alternative approach to probing spin effect is to consider higher twist collinear functions such as the qiu - sterman function  @xcite . by taking transverse momentum moments of cross sections it is possible to relate tmds to these higher twist functions",
    "@xcite . see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent work on the evolution of weighted spin - dependent correlation functions .",
    "establishing reliable , evolved tmds is also important for testing factorization and searching for instances of factorization breaking .",
    "discussions of non - universality or factorization breaking often bring in the concept of wilson lines ( or gauge - links ) , and the process dependent properties that can be associated with them .",
    "already when comparing the sivers function in sidis and the dy process , one must account for a well - known sign flip that is due to the reversed direction of the wilson lines in these two processes  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that obtaining consistent wilson lines is even more problematic in the hadro - production of hadrons or jets ( @xmath3 ) . in such cases that require tmd - factorization , it was found that _ at a minimum _ the wilson lines for separate tmds are highly complex and process dependent  @xcite .",
    "it was later shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that tmd - factorization generally breaks down completely in the hadro - production of hadrons .",
    "that is , separate tmds can not even be defined for each external hadron regardless of what wilson lines are used in the definitions .",
    "the complication in the case of the complete breakdown of factorization is caused by a failure of the usual gauge invariance / ward identity arguments that are needed in a factorization proof .",
    "a confirmation of this effect would point to interesting new features of strong interaction physics , given that the breakdown of factorization is in just the range of kinematics where factorization would naively be expected to hold .",
    "calculations in a gpm framework  @xcite will be needed for making predictions that can be compared with experiment to test factorization and/or search for factorization breaking .",
    "furthermore , computations using the methods in , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite can potentially help to quantify and better understand the factorization breaking mechanism .",
    "it may soon be possible to find experimental evidence for factorization breaking , particularly in the analysis of rhic data .",
    "( see , for example , the recent analysis of ref .",
    "however , definitive tests of factorization or factorization breaking can only become possible with a more precise determination of the tmds .",
    "another motivation for this article is therefore to begin the determination of tmd parametrizations that should be used in tests of factorization in the case of spin - independent hadro - production of back - to - back hadrons .",
    "finally , in this paper we include some details of the calculation of the evolution of the tmd pdfs that did not appear in ref .",
    "@xcite    the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : overview ] , a brief background of tmd - factorization is provided , and the main complications that arise in the context of pqcd are discussed . in sect .",
    "[ sec : setupandnotation ] , we set up the notation , and in sect .",
    "[ sec : defins ] we explain the definitions of tmd correlation functions . in sect .",
    "[ sec : evolved ] , we discuss the evolution of the tmds in terms of the css formalism .",
    "we apply evolution to existing unpolarized quark tmd fits in sect .  [ sec : impevol ] , and we present some numerical results .",
    "we conclude with an overview and a discussion of future work in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] . in the appendices ,",
    "we provide some details of the perturbative parts of our calculations .",
    "in this section we expand on the general remarks in the introduction by providing a very schematic overview of the different ways tmd - factorization is approached in phenomenological applications .",
    "we discuss the relationship between parton model intuition and full pqcd while emphasizing the complications that can arise .",
    "we explain the potential for confusion when evolution and soft factors are included , and how this is solved by the use of fully consistent definitions for the tmds .",
    "we start by considering the simplest parton model picture of high energy collisions . there , the concept of a tmd - factorization formula becomes very intuitive and easy to state .",
    "the cross section is simply a partonic sub - process , folded with tmd pdfs and tmd ffs . in sidis , for example , the hadronic tensor is written as @xmath4 here @xmath5 describes the hard partonic sub - process , @xmath6 , for scattering off a quark of flavor @xmath7 as a function of the hard scale @xmath8 .",
    "( it also includes any overall factors needed to make the left side a proper hadronic tensor . )",
    "the size of @xmath9 is a measure of the non - collinearity in the process . within the parton model ,",
    "the tmds @xmath10 and @xmath11 have simple probabilistic interpretations ; @xmath10 , for example , is the probability density for finding a quark of flavor @xmath7 with momentum fraction @xmath1 and transverse momentum @xmath12 inside the proton .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : parton1 ] ) is closely analogous to the standard _ collinear _ factorization theorem of inclusive processes  @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that the tmd pdfs and ffs are allowed to carry intrinsic transverse momentum .    the intuitive approach to tmd - factorization embodied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : parton1 ] ) forms the basis of much current tmd phenomenology .",
    "however , derivations of tmd - factorization order - by - order in real pqcd involve complications that are not immediately apparent in parton model reasoning .",
    "indeed , some aspects of partonic intuition can quickly lead to incorrect results if taken too literally .",
    "furthermore , without a complete derivation of factorization , the issue of universality ( or non - universality ) of the tmds in eq .",
    "( [ eq : parton1 ] ) is much less clear .",
    "one issue is the appearance of extra divergences .",
    "in addition to the standard uv divergences associated with the renormalization of the theory , the tmd correlation functions also contain so - called `` light - cone '' divergences .",
    "they arise if the wilson lines ( gauge links ) in the definitions of the tmds point in exactly light - like directions .",
    "we should note that the same light - cone singularities are not present in the ordinary collinear correlation functions because they cancel in a sum over final state interactions , which is possible due to integrations over the loop momenta , including the @xmath0 integrals .",
    "light - cone divergences correspond to gluons moving with infinite rapidity in the direction _ opposite _ the containing hadron , and are not regulated by the use of an infrared cutoff , so they amount to a real inconsistency in the definitions of tmds .",
    "the most naive definitions , therefore , are invalid , and modifications are needed for a reliable factorization theorem .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein for a review of this and other subtleties involved in defining consistent pdfs . )",
    "the light - cone divergences need to be regulated , typically by tilting the wilson lines slightly away from the exactly light - like directions .",
    "furthermore , in a tmd - factorization formula the role of soft gluons becomes important .",
    "( in this paper , `` soft '' refers to nearly on - shell gluons with rapidity intermediate between the rapidities of the colliding hadrons and produced jets . )",
    "they imply that another correlation function , a separate soft factor , should be inserted into factorization formulae like eq .",
    "( [ eq : parton1 ] ) , in addition to the usual tmd pdfs and ffs .",
    "already , the appearance of a soft factor seems to contradict the basic parton - model intuition .",
    "the complications listed above , as well as a consistent matching to collinear factorization at large transverse momentum , are accounted for in the css formalism  @xcite . with",
    "the wilson lines tilted to remove light - cone divergences , the factorization formula acquires new arbitrary parameters .",
    "predictive power is then recovered by a kind of generalization of renormalization group techniques .",
    "the resulting evolution equations may be thought of as describing the variation of the tmds and the soft factors with changes in the degree of tilt of the wilson lines .",
    "physically , this corresponds roughly to a variation with respect to a cutoff on the phase space available for recoil against soft gluons .      while the css formalism has been very useful for past phenomenological studies , the usual implementations bear little surface resemblance to the generalized partonic picture we started out with in eq .",
    "( [ eq : parton1 ] ) .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and similar applications of the css formalism to the dy process ) the effects of evolution are gathered into separate factors , and it is not clear how they relate to separate tmd pdfs . in other treatments",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , factorization formulae for sidis are provided which contain explicit evolved tmds , but they also involve separate explicit soft factors , and the hard part has explicit dependence on light - cone divergence cutoff parameters . moreover , given the general observations that are reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is questionable whether the most commonly quoted definitions of the tmds are even fully consistent .    the original work of collins and soper  @xcite used a non - light - like axial gauge to regulate the rapidity divergences .",
    "later , collins and hautmann  @xcite proposed definitions in which the main legs of the wilson lines are light - like , but in which there is a division by a special type of soft factor which cancels the rapidity divergences .",
    "however , these definitions continue to suffer from problems , including the appearance of badly divergent wilson line self - energy contributions as discussed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite and also utilized in the treatment of tmd pdfs in ref .  @xcite . while many of these issues have typically been discussed in the context of tmd pdfs ,",
    "the same problems arise in the treatment of ffs .",
    "finally , it has remained unclear how the tmds that have been used in past applications of evolution and the css formalism are related to the tmds of other approaches , such as those based more on generalized parton model pictures . in parametrizations of tmds ,",
    "the role of the soft factor is often not explicitly included and evolution is ignored .",
    "many other theoretical tmd studies continue to quote definitions with exactly light - like wilson lines .",
    "knowledge of the operator definitions for the tmds is also needed for lattice tmd calculations  @xcite , and in model calculations .",
    "clearly , a more unified treatment of tmd - factorization is necessary in order to bring together these different approaches to the study of tmds .",
    "what is needed , in addition to fully consistent tmd definitions , is a formulation that retains as much as possible the basic factorized structure of eq .",
    "( [ eq : parton1 ] ) , but which appropriately includes evolution and the effects of soft factors . ideally , the situation should be closely analogous to what already exists for collinear factorization .",
    "namely , it should be possible to clearly identify consistent and universal tmds that can be tabulated or parametrized and then reused in formulae like eq .",
    "( [ eq : parton1 ] ) to make predictions for a wide variety of processes .",
    "fortunately , this has been achieved in the recent work of ref .",
    "there , the factorization formula for sidis takes the form : @xmath13 the first term on the right - hand side of this equation ( responsible for the low-@xmath9 behavior ) has exactly the structure of the partonic tmd - factorization formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq : parton1 ] ) , apart from the scale dependence denoted by @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the arguments @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 will be discussed more in the explanation of the tmd definitions in sect .",

    "they are defined as : @xmath18 and @xmath19 here , @xmath1 and @xmath20 are the usual bjorken scaling and fragmentation variables , @xmath21 is the proton mass and @xmath22 is the mass of the produced hadron .",
    "the rapidities of the proton and produced hadron are @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the rapidity @xmath25 is an arbitrary low - rapidity cutoff parameter that separates partons with large forward rapidity ( in the proton direction ) from backward rapidity ( in the produced hadron direction ) .",
    "variations of these functions with @xmath25 will be determined by the evolution equations .",
    "the scale @xmath14 is the standard renormalization group ( rg ) scale .",
    "the tmd correlation functions , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , have definite and consistent operator definitions .",
    "they include the effects from soft gluons in such a way that no soft factor appears explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ eq : parton3 ] ) .",
    "evolution can be implemented on @xmath26 and @xmath27 independently , and the basic steps closely follow the usual css approach .",
    "we will discuss the definitions more in the next section , but for now we mention that they solve most of the theoretical problems summarized in refs .",
    "@xcite and sect .",
    "[ sec : confusing ] , including the appearance of light - cone divergences and wilson line self - interactions .",
    "the term , @xmath28 , accounts for the large-@xmath9 dependence of the cross section , where the approximations needed for tmd - factorization break down .",
    "there , collinear factorization becomes the appropriate framework .",
    "the error term is suppressed by @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "the first term on the right side of eq .  ( [ eq : parton3 ] ) is valid up to corrections of order @xmath31 , but the @xmath32 is needed for a valid treatment of factorization over the full range of @xmath9 .    the derivation of eq .   within pqcd factorization , with consistent definitions for the tmds ,",
    "is an important breakthrough because it connects tmd studies from a gpm framework with formal qcd and clarifies the meaning of tmd evolution .",
    "we will use eq .",
    "( [ eq : parton3 ] ) , along with the associated definitions for the tmds from ref .",
    "@xcite , to obtain momentum space fits for use in phenomenology .",
    "the non - perturbative input can be obtained from already existing models or fits made at fixed scales .",
    "for the tmd pdfs , much information about the non - perturbative input is already available from fits that use the standard @xmath33-space formulation of the css formalism in the dy process .",
    "we start by setting up the basic notation . in our convention for light - cone variables ,",
    "a four - vector @xmath34 has components , @xmath35 the @xmath20-component picks out the forward direction .",
    "note that @xmath36 .    for the processes we are interested in , there are always two relevant light - like directions which we label @xmath37 and @xmath38 and define to be : @xmath39 in the sidis example , @xmath37 and @xmath38 characterize the directions of the incoming proton and the produced jet .",

    "as discussed in the previous section , light - cone divergences must be regulated by tilting the direction of the wilson line away from the exactly light - like direction .",
    "therefore , we need to define another set of vectors @xmath46 and @xmath47 analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lldir ] ) but slightly tilted , so that they have rapidities @xmath48 and @xmath49 : @xmath50 note that the tilted wilson line directions are space - like , @xmath51 .",

    "though our results apply generally to the standard factorizable processes , we will continue to use sidis as a reference process for explaining the definitions .",
    "let us also rewrite the tmd - factorization formula for sidis in eq .",

    "it is an expectation value of a wilson loop :    @xmath60    we have used the vectors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlldir ] ) to define the directions of the wilson lines so that , as long as @xmath48 and @xmath49 are finite , the wilson lines in eq .",
    "( [ eq : soft ] ) are non - light - like .",
    "the subscripts @xmath61 and @xmath55 are color triplet indices , and repeated indices are summed over .",
    "the `` @xmath62 '' subscript indicates that bare fields are used .",
    "the soft factor contains wilson line self - interaction ( s.i . ) divergences that are very badly divergent and are unrelated to the original unfactorized graphs",
    ". they must therefore be excluded , and we indicate this with a subscript `` @xmath63 '' .",
    "we emphasize , however , that this is only a temporary requirement because all wilson line self - energy contributions will cancel in the final definitions .",
    "another potential complication , pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , is that exact gauge invariance requires the wilson lines to be closed by the insertion of links at light - cone infinity in the transverse direction .",
    "however , the transverse segments will not contribute in the final definitions of the tmds ( at least in non - singular gauges ) , so we do not show them explicitly in eq .  .",
    "again , the final arrangement of soft factors will ensure a cancellation .    rather than appearing as a separate factor in the tmd - factorization formula , soft factors like eq .",
    "( [ eq : soft ] ) will be part of the final definitions of the tmds .",
    "their role in the definitions will be essential for the internal consistency of the tmds and their validity in a factorization formula like eq .",
    "( [ eq : sidis ] ) .",
    "now we turn to the definitions of the tmds themselves , starting with the unpolarized tmd pdf .",

    "a precise understanding of the definitions , evolution , and universality properties of these correlation functions is what enables calculations in pqcd to make accurate first principles predictions .",
    "while the standard formalism of collinear factorization has proven extremely useful for sufficiently inclusive processes , the more sophisticated formalism of tmd - factorization is needed for processes in which the intrinsic transverse momentum of the partons becomes important .",
    "as has already been widely discussed , there are a number of technical and conceptual subtleties involved in arriving at good definitions for the tmds that are consistent with factorization .",
    "these issues include the need to regulate and deal with rapidity divergences and achieve a cancellation of spurious wilson line self - energies .",
    "the subtleties involved in defining tmds have largely been clarified and resolved in ref .",
    "@xcite , which provides definitions that are consistent with the requirements of factorization , and demonstrates the relationship with the usual css formalism .",
    "while considerable effort has been devoted to implementing css evolution in unpolarized scattering , the resulting parametrizations are often not framed in the language of tmd pdfs . by contrast , for polarization dependent tmds , there has been very little work done in implementing evolution in the parametrization of experimental data . up to this point , these functions have only been probed over a very narrow range of scales so that evolution has not been a major issue . however , for future progress in understanding the role of quark and gluon degrees of freedom in hadronic structure , it will be important to remedy this situation .",
    "ideally , there should be collections of tabulated fits to the tmds that incorporate evolution , and which can be directly related to the field - theoretic definitions of the correlation functions , analogous to what has already existed for some time in collinear factorization .",
    "we have started this process by recasting previously performed fits  @xcite of unpolarized tmd pdfs and tmd ffs in terms of the tmd definitions of ref .",
    "this provides a much clearer connection between the formalism of evolution and generalized parton model approaches , and provides practical tmd parametrizations that can be used directly in tmd calculations .",
    "we have also completed the derivation of the lowest order anomalous dimensions and coefficient functions for the tmd pdf . at our website",
    "@xcite , we have supplied tables and interpolation routines for the parts of the quark tmd pdfs and ffs that can be described using collinear factorization ( the `` a - factors '' in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : evolvedpdf ] ,  [ eq : evolvedff ] ) ) for each flavor of quark , as well as sample calculations that give plots like fig .",
    "[ fig : tmdpdf ] .    we have confirmed the important observation that evolution has a strong quantitative effect on the tmds and therefore should be included in future phenomenological applications of tmd factorization , particularly given the range of energy scales that are set to be probed in the future .",
    "another reason to have reliable fits of tmds , including evolution , is that it opens the possibility to identify instances of factorization breaking effects of the type discussed in ref",
    ".  @xcite . recognizing",
    "factorization breaking effects will be an important next step in expanding our understanding of pqcd phenomenology .",
    "even in unpolarized scattering , there is a possibility to use parametrizations like those presented in this paper to test the factorization hypothesis .",
    "recent rhic data  @xcite , for example , may be useful for such an analysis .    nevertheless , much work remains to be done .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty in the tmd fits can be reduced by including higher orders in the calculations of the anomalous dimensions , the @xmath239 kernel , and the collinear coefficient functions .",
    "moreover , as new data from experiments like those taking place at the lhc , rhic , jlab , and a possible electron - ion collider are made available and analyzed , it will be possible to obtain improved fits . already , there are data from atlas  @xcite which can potentially help to improve the quality of fits for the unpolarized tmds .",
    "tmd effects can also be studied in an @xmath77 collider as recently discussed in ref .",
    "a number of theoretical issues with the evolution formalism itself also remain unsettled .",
    "for instance , the precise form of the matching function for between perturbative and non - perturbative transverse momentum regimes in eq .",
    "is somewhat arbitrary and better prescriptions may be possible .",
    "along similar lines , a truly optimal choice of @xmath240 may be different from the values we have used here .",
    "one possiblility may be to formulate the evolution directly in momentum space .",
    "one of the most important next steps is to extend the analysis presented in this paper to the sivers and boer - mulders functions , which are needed for clarifying the spin structure of hadrons .",
    "efforts to address polarization dependent situations can utilize existing fixed - scale fits ( such as  @xcite ) . in such cases ,",
    "a careful treatment of the matching between large and small transverse momenta will also be important  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it will be important to establish the relationship be evolved tmds and the evolution of weighted functions such as those treated in ref .",

    "fits of the gluon tmd pdf that include css evolution will be also be needed , especially in tests of factorization .",
    "see  @xcite for recent work related to evolution and gluon resummation in the context of gluon pdfs .",
    "in addition , recent calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite have shown how to probe linearly polarized gluons in heavy quark production , and the universality properties of the gluon tmd pdf have been clarified in ref .",
    "@xcite . for processes that probe the gluon tmds",

    "the issue of so - called `` super - leading regions '' in the factorization theorems that use the gluon distribution  @xcite still needs to be clarified in the tmd case .",

    "<S> we assess the current phenomenological status of transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and fragmentation functions ( ffs ) and study the effect of consistently including perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) evolution . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to initiate the process of establishing reliable , qcd - evolved parametrizations for the tmd pdfs and tmd ffs that can be used both to test tmd - factorization and to search for evidence of the breakdown of tmd - factorization that is expected for certain processes . in this article , we focus on spin - independent processes because they provide the simplest illustration of the basic steps and can already be used in direct tests of tmd - factorization . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are based on the collins - soper - sterman ( css ) formalism , supplemented by recent theoretical developments which have clarified the precise definitions of the tmd pdfs and tmd ffs needed for a valid tmd - factorization theorem . starting with these definitions </S>",
    "<S> , we numerically generate evolved tmd pdfs and tmd ffs using as input existing parametrizations for the collinear pdfs , collinear ffs , non - perturbative factors in the css factorization formalism , and recent fixed - scale fits . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that evolution has important consequences , both qualitatively and quantitatively , and argue that it should be included in future phenomenological studies of tmd functions . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is also suggestive of extensions to processes that involve spin - dependent functions such as the boer - mulders , sivers , or collins functions , which we intend to pursue in future publications . at our website  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have made available the tables and calculations needed to obtain the tmd parametrizations presented herein . </S>"
