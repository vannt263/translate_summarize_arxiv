    "the flavor structure of quarks and leptons in the standard model is mysterious",
    ". why are there three generations ? why are their masses hierarchically different from each other ? why do they show the specific mixing angles ? it is challenging to try to solve this flavor mystery .",
    "a flavor symmetry could play an important role in particle physics models in order to understand the flavor structure of quarks and leptons .",
    "since the yukawa matrices of the standard model include many parameters , flavor symmetries are useful to effectively reduce the number of parameters and to obtain some predictions for experiments .",
    "in particular , non - abelian discrete flavor symmetries can be key ingredients to make models with a suitable flavor structure .",
    "indeed , there are many works of flavor models utilizing various non - abelian discrete flavor symmetries ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "it is known that some non - abelian discrete flavor symmetries have a stringy origin . in particular , in orbifold compactification of heterotic string theory @xcite ( also see a review @xcite ) , non - abelian discrete symmetries @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively arise from one- and two - dimensional orbifolds , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , as discussed in @xcite can appear in intersecting / magnetized d - brane models @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite . ] .",
    "the non - abelian discrete symmetries originate from a geometrical property of extra - dimensional orbifolds , the permutation symmetry of orbifold fixed points , and a string selection rule between closed strings .",
    "phenomenological applications of string derived non - abelian discrete symmetries to flavor models are analyzed , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , it is argued that the non - abelian discrete symmetries @xmath8 and @xmath9 have a gauge origin within the heterotic string theory .",
    "namely , these symmetries are respectively enhanced to continuous gauge symmetries @xmath12 and @xmath1 at a symmetry enhancement point in the moduli space of orbifolds .",
    "after certain scalar fields which are associated with the khler moduli fields get vacuum expectation values , the @xmath0 symmetries break down to abelian discrete subgroups , and there remains a @xmath13 or @xmath14 symmetry group , respectively .",
    "this result suggests that a non - abelian discrete symmetry can be regarded as a remnant of a continuous gauge symmetry .",
    "also , this result could provide us with a new insight on model building for flavor physics .",
    "various non - abelian discrete symmetries other than @xmath8 and @xmath9 have been used in field - theoretical model building , e.g. @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is important to extend the stringy derivation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 from @xmath12 and @xmath1 , by studying a field - theoretical derivation of other non - abelian discrete flavor symmetries from @xmath20 or @xmath21 ( see also @xcite ) . that is the purpose of this paper .",
    "some of them may be reproduced from other types of string compactifications .    in this paper",
    "we consider an extension of the argument of the gauge origin in @xcite to field - theoretical model building .",
    "we show that phenomenologically interesting non - abelian discrete symmetries can be embedded into @xmath20 or @xmath21 continuous gauge theory .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath22 to abelian discrete symmetries leads to non - abelian discrete flavor symmetries . in the next section",
    "we discuss a gauge theory realization of non - abelian discrete symmetries . in section 3 , we show a concrete lepton flavor model based on a @xmath0 flavor symmetry .",
    "section 4 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in this section we investigate a field theoretical model building technique in which non - abelian discrete symmetries have a continuous gauge symmetry origin .",
    "we start with a gauge theory with group structure of the form @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "then , by giving a suitable vev to a scalar field , a non - abelian discrete symmetry is realized effectively .",
    "we consider a @xmath12 model with the field contents as in table [ tab : fields3 ] .",
    "the action of the @xmath25 symmetry on the @xmath0 charge @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 by this we mean that the @xmath0 gauge field @xmath28 transforms as @xmath29 , and that the oppositely charged fields in this model transform into each other , e.g. @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this implies that the kinetic ( and gauge interaction ) terms are invariant under the @xmath25 .",
    "now , we consider vevs for fields @xmath32 obeying the relation @xmath33 this vev relation maintains the original @xmath25 permutation symmetry , @xmath34 but breaks the @xmath0 group to a discrete @xmath35 subgroup since the field @xmath36 has @xmath0 charge @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath35 charges are @xmath38 for the field @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the field @xmath41 , so the @xmath35 action is expressed by @xmath42 with the cubic root @xmath43 .",
    "the combination of the two actions and gives rise to a non - abelian discrete symmetry , which is nothing but @xmath44 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath45 forms a doublet of this @xmath15 group .",
    "next , we read off the @xmath15 representation of the other matter fields .",
    "first , the field @xmath46 can be regarded as the trivial singlet @xmath47 of the @xmath15 group . in the case of @xmath48 , we see that these fields have trivial @xmath35 charges . then we can perform a change of basis as @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "in this basis , the @xmath25 action is given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "hence , @xmath48 forms a @xmath53 of the @xmath15 group . as a result",
    ", we can reproduce all irreducible representations of the @xmath15 group .",
    ".field contents of the @xmath12 model for the @xmath15 group .",
    "besides the @xmath0 charges , the charges under the unbroken discrete @xmath35 subgroup of @xmath0 are shown .",
    "representations under the resulting @xmath15 group are also shown . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      first , we consider the yukawa sector of the model . by invariance under @xmath54 ,",
    "the superpotentials of the neutrino sector and the charged lepton sector are given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "here , we assume a uv cutoff scale @xmath57",
    ". then the mass matrices are given by @xmath58 where we used the following definition for the vevs of the flavon fields : @xmath59 note that the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal .",
    "thus , the mixing angles are determined only by the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "next we consider the flavon sector .",
    "the superpotential up to three - point level including only flavon fields is given by @xmath60 the f - flatness condition for the flavon superpotential leads to ( for @xmath61 ) @xmath62 there are two branches of solutions :    a.   let us first assume @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "then we can solve for @xmath65 and insert the solution in to .",
    "then , we obtain the condition @xmath66 , so we can choose the vevs as : @xmath67 b.   if not all @xmath63 or @xmath64 then there exist solutions , and they can be brought into the following form by an @xmath15 transformation : @xmath68 with the condition @xmath69 .    furthermore , the vevs of any two components @xmath70 must be zero . in the following we assume @xmath71 the @xmath72",
    "are not constrained from f - flatness .      in the following we consider only the case ( a ) . by inserting the vevs",
    "the mass matrix becomes @xmath73 for the later convenience we define the following parameters @xmath74 ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 not to be confused with the flavon fields @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath70 ) and rewrite the mass matrix as @xmath80 it turns out that this mass matrix has the following relations , @xmath81 note that the three equations are dependent . actually , the third equation is a consequence of the first and the second equations .",
    "the first equation can be solved by @xmath82 as @xmath83 thus if the mass matrix @xmath84 is fixed , the parameter @xmath82 can be derived .",
    "hence , is a prediction for ratios of elements of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath84 .",
    "now , we investigate whether this model can explain the experimental values of mass hierarchies and mixings . in our model , the charged lepton mass matrix already takes a diagonal form , so the pmns mixing matrix @xmath85 is given by a unitary matrix @xmath86 which diagonalizes the neutrino mass matrix as @xmath87 here , the rotation matrices are defined by three mixing angles @xmath88 and three cp phases @xmath89 as @xmath90 for simplicity , here we consider only the case where @xmath91 we also set the mixing angle @xmath92 to fit the experimental value as @xmath93 then the mixing matrix is a real matrix . as for the neutrino mass differences ,",
    "we wish to reproduce the case of the inverted hierarchy : @xmath94 and regard the third family neutrino mass @xmath95 as a parameter .",
    "these values are consistent with the global analysis in @xcite within @xmath96 range .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is then obtained as @xmath97 where @xmath98 . in figure",
    "[ fig : tablem3t23 ] , we show a prediction for various values of @xmath99 from the ratio condition of this mass matrix . in the figure",
    "we show solutions of the mixing angle @xmath100 against the third generation neutrino mass @xmath95 for with fixed @xmath101 angles , @xmath102 , which is in @xmath96 range .",
    "( in degrees ) against the third generation neutrino mass @xmath95 ( in ev ) for various values of the mixing angle @xmath101 ( in degrees).,width=377 ]    actually , there exist solutions for our parameters @xmath103 in to realize these experimental values .",
    "for example , if we take the parameters to be @xmath104 we can obtain @xmath105 .",
    "this solution is also consistent with the @xmath96 range of recent fits from neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite : @xmath106      next , we consider the charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "we want to fix the charged lepton masses as @xmath107 the charged lepton masses are constrained from the d - flatness condition , which for this model is given by @xmath108 or equivalently @xmath109 after inserting the solution @xmath110 from we can numerically solve as a linear equation . here",
    ", we only consider the simplified case where @xmath111 .",
    "then , we obtain a single solution , @xmath112 then , by taking `` natural '' values , @xmath113 , and by imposing @xmath114 we arrive at @xmath115 other values of @xmath116 and @xmath57 are possible by appropriately adjusting the couplings .",
    "in this work , motivated by a gauge origin of discrete symmetries in the framework of the heterotic orbifold models , we have investigated gauge theoretical realizations of non - abelian discrete flavor symmetries . we have shown that phenomenologically interesting discrete symmetries are realized effectively from a @xmath23 or @xmath24 gauge theory .",
    "these theories can be regarded as uv completions of discrete flavor models .",
    "the main difference between a discrete flavor model and a @xmath0 flavor model as shown in this paper can be seen in the field interactions .",
    "namely , some fields in a discrete flavor model can be distinguished in a @xmath0 flavor model .",
    "for example , the @xmath117 representation field of the @xmath9 symmetry can be described by several @xmath118 charges , @xmath119 , @xmath120 etc .",
    "thus a superpotential in a @xmath0 flavor model can be different from the one of the corresponding discrete flavor model .",
    "in general , @xmath23 and @xmath24 flavor models are constrained more than flavor models with non - abelian discrete flavor symmetries , which are subgroups of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , because symmetries are larger . our results would provide a new insight on flavor models .",
    "we have introduced the specific combination of @xmath118 charges , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 , to realize @xmath16 , @xmath9 , @xmath17 and @xmath124 .",
    "they correspond to weights of the triplet ( or anti - triplet ) representation of @xmath125 .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 is a subgroup of @xmath125 , where @xmath15 is associated with the weyl group .",
    "we also obtained genuine @xmath1 representations which are not obtained from @xmath125 triplets by spontaneous symmetry breaking . also , in a stringy realization of @xmath9 , the @xmath125 gauge symmetry appears in toroidal compactification , and the non - zero roots can be projected out by an orbifold projection @xcite .",
    "this may also suggest that a similar situation can be realized field - theoretically in a higher - dimensional @xmath125 gauge theory with a suitable orbifold boundary condition .",
    "anomalies of non - abelian discrete symmetries are important @xcite .",
    "anomalous discrete symmetries would be violated by non - perturbative effects , but its breaking effects might be small depending on dynamical scales of non - perturbative effects . by our construction , discrete abelian symmetries originating from @xmath126 of @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "are always anomaly - free and exact symmetries , but @xmath127 and @xmath128 of @xmath23 and @xmath24 can include anomalous discrete symmetries depending on the model .",
    "we have constructed a concrete flavor model for the lepton sector based on the @xmath1 continuous gauge theory .",
    "we have shown that it is possible obtain a realistic flavor structure from this model .",
    "since the model is based on an extended symmetry the number of the parameters is relatively few . in particular",
    ", we could show a relation between the angle @xmath100 and third generation neutrino mass @xmath95 .",
    "we have shown six types of gauge realizations of non - abelian discrete symmetries . however , further extensions are possible .",
    "for example , extensions to higher @xmath129 , @xmath130 , is possible if we consider models with @xmath0 charges @xmath131 .",
    "it is also possible to include further representations of e.g. @xmath1 which we did not cover here for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the general representation theory of these semidirect groups is obtained from the little group method of wigner , which is familiar from the representation theory of the poincar group .",
    "then , e.g. in the case of @xmath1 one obtains an uncharged singlet representation which transforms as @xmath132 under @xmath15 while being uncharged under the @xmath118 .",
    "a phenomenological implication of our @xmath0 flavor models is that there should be @xmath133 boson(s ) which originate from @xmath0 gauge groups in the effective theory . in this framework @xmath133 bosons and flavor structures",
    "are related . since we assigned different @xmath0 charges to the three - generation leptons , the @xmath133 bosons have flavor dependent interactions .",
    "thus , if @xmath133 bosons are light as e.g. the tev scale , they can be a probe of the flavor structure",
    ". it will be interesting to investigate @xmath133 phenomenology by extending well - known discrete flavor models .",
