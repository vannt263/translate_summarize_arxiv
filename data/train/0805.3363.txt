    "let @xmath3 be an infinite - dimensional non - negatively graded vector space over @xmath2 with finite - dimensional components @xmath4 .",
    "our goal in this paper is to establish the kontsevich formality theorem for the hochschild complex of the algebra @xmath5 .",
    "we start the paper with defining what are the right versions of polyvector fields on @xmath1 and of the cohomological hochschild complex of @xmath6 for an infinite - dimensional vector space @xmath1 with finite - dimensional graded components .",
    "then we prove an analog of the hochschild - kostant - rosenberg theorem in our setting .",
    "first of all , let us define an appropriate lie algebra of polyvector fields @xmath8 .",
    "we want to allow some infinite sums .",
    "here is the precise definition .",
    "an @xmath9-linear polyvector field @xmath10 of inner degree @xmath11 is a ( possibly infinite ) sum in @xmath12 such that all summands have degree @xmath11 ( here we set @xmath13 ) . with a fixed element in @xmath14 , its `` coefficient '' maybe only a finite sum because the vector space @xmath1 is non - negatively graded .",
    "we denote the space of @xmath9-linear polyvector fields of inner degree @xmath11 on the space @xmath1 by @xmath15 . now",
    "the space of @xmath9-linear polyvector fields @xmath16 is by definition a _ direct sum _ @xmath17 .",
    "that is , _ any polyvector field has a finite number of non - zero inner degrees_. the schouten - nijenhuis bracket of two such polyvector fields is well - defined .",
    "we denote this graded lie algebra by @xmath7 .",
    "now we define some hochschild cohomological complex of the algebra @xmath19 which has as its cohomology the graded lie algebra @xmath7 .",
    "we define an @xmath20-cochain as an element in @xmath21 _ having only a finite number of different inner gradings_. here we set , as before , @xmath19 .",
    "we denote this hochschild complex by @xmath18 .",
    "it is a dg lie algebra with the gerstenhaber bracket .",
    "the cohomology of this hochschild complex can be interpreted as a derived functor , as follows .",
    "denote by @xmath22 the category whose objects are graded ( with respect to the inner grading ) @xmath6-bimodules , and whose morphisms are graded maps between them .",
    "then @xmath22 is an abelian category . for an object @xmath23 ,",
    "denote by @xmath24 the object of @xmath22 whose inner grading defined as usual : @xmath25 .",
    "we have the following lemma :    the cohomology @xmath26 is equal to the @xmath27 . here in the r.h.s .",
    "we have the direct sum , an element of it is a finite linear combination of elements of the summands .",
    "the bar - resolution of @xmath6 is clearly a projective resolution of the tautological bimodule @xmath6 in @xmath22 .",
    "we compute the @xmath28s functors using this resolution .",
    "the complex @xmath29 is exactly the complex @xmath18 .",
    "define the hochschild - kostant - rosenberg map @xmath30 as @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "we have the following result :    the map @xmath33 is a quasi - isomorphism of complexes .",
    "consider the following koszul complex @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 where _ all infinite tensor products are allowed _ , and the differential is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a basis in @xmath39 compatible with the grading @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the same basis in the second copy of @xmath1 , and @xmath42 is the corresponded basis in @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "this koszul complex is clearly a resolution of the tautological @xmath6-bimodule @xmath6 by free bimodules , it is a resolution in the category @xmath22 because the differential @xmath44 preserves the inner grading .",
    "when we compute @xmath45 , we get exactly @xmath7 with zero differential .    it remains to note that the image of the hochschild - kostant - rosenberg map coincides with the cohomology classes in @xmath46 given by the koszul resolution .",
    "let us comment here why the kontsevich s formality theorem is not clear in the infinite - dimensional setting .",
    "let us try to prove it using the kontsevich s graphical technique from [ k97 ] .",
    "then , if a graph @xmath47 contains an oriented cycle between some its vertices of the first type , the corresponding polydifferential operator @xmath48 may be ill - defined for an infinite - dimensional vector space @xmath1 .",
    "the reason for this is that an oriented cycle looks like trace which may be ill - defined for an operator on an infinite - dimensional space .",
    "we have , however , the following lemma :    let @xmath47 be a kontsevich admissible graph in the sense of [ k97 ] with @xmath49 vertices of the first type and @xmath50 vertices of the second type .",
    "suppose that the graph @xmath47 has no any oriented cycles between vertices of the first type .",
    "let @xmath1 be as above , and let @xmath51 .",
    "then the kontsevich s polydifferential operator @xmath52 is a well - defined element of @xmath18 .",
    "the proof is clear .",
    "thus , only the graphs with oriented cycles cause a problem for us , and we should exclude them from the graphical computations .",
    "we really succeed to do that by constructing of a new propagator 1-form .",
    "however , we should pay for it : the kontsevich s lemma [ k97 ] , section 6.6 is not anymore true .",
    "it means that we get a new @xmath0 structure on @xmath7 , such that the second taylor component is the schouten - nienhuis bracket , and there are higher non - vanishing taylor components .",
    "we describe this @xmath0 structure first .",
    "for an oriented graph @xmath47 we denote by @xmath54 the set of its vertices , by @xmath55 the set of its edges , and for a vertex @xmath56 we denote by @xmath57 the set of outgoing edges from the vertex @xmath58 , and by @xmath59 the set of outgoing edges from the vertex @xmath58 .    throughout this section , by an * admissible graph * @xmath47 we mean an oriented graph without oriented loops .",
    "its vertices are labeled by @xmath60 , and it may have any number of edges , in particular , it is not necessarily connected .",
    "( the ordering of the vertices is a part of the data of an admissible graph ) .",
    "the ordering should obey the following relation .",
    "denote by @xmath61 the label of the vertex @xmath58 , @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "then one should have : @xmath63 we denote the set of admissible graphs @xmath47 with @xmath49 vertices and @xmath64 edges by @xmath65 .",
    "any graph without loops has at least one labeling obeying ( [ knew ] ) , but some of them clearly may have several admissible labeling , see figure 1 .",
    "let @xmath66 .",
    "define the configuration space @xmath53 , as follows : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a 3-dimensional group of transformations .",
    "in particular , if @xmath69 we recognize the kontsevich s configuration space @xmath70 from [ k97 ] .",
    "dimension @xmath71 is equal to @xmath72 and does not depend on @xmath47 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath74 is an edge of @xmath47 , we associate with it the differential 1-form @xmath75 the numeration of the vertices of @xmath47 gives a corresponding numeration of the edges : firstly we count the edges outgoing from the vertex 1 , in the order of the end - vertex , then we count the edges outgoing from the vertex 2 , and so on .",
    "define @xmath76 here in the wedge product we use the order of the 1-forms @xmath77 corresponding to the ordering of the edges of @xmath47 described above .    in [ k97 ] , section 6.2 ,",
    "m.kontsevich has the combinatorial factor @xmath78 before an analogous formula .",
    "the reason why we omit this factor here is the following . in [ k97 ] in the definition of an admissible graph not only",
    "the vertices are labeled , but also the sets @xmath57 for all vertices @xmath58 are ordered .",
    "it is not necessary because as soon as the vertices are enumerated , there appears a canonical ordering , by the number of the end - vertex .",
    "therefore , we omit here and thereafter this ingredient from the data of an admissible graph . as a consequence ,",
    "we have not the mentioned above combinatorial factor .",
    "we prove firstly that @xmath79 may be nonzero only for an even @xmath49 .",
    "for an odd @xmath49 , the integral @xmath80 for any number of edges @xmath81 .    fix one vertex @xmath82 using the group @xmath83 to the point @xmath84 , and let another point @xmath85 move along the unit circle around @xmath82 . draw the vertical line @xmath20 through @xmath82 and consider the symmetry @xmath86 with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "we have the following general formula : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is an _ oriented _ chain .    in our case @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we have : @xmath91 ( there are @xmath72 edges ) , and at each movable point ( there is @xmath92 of such points ) the orientation changes to @xmath93",
    ". finally , if @xmath94 is the integral , we have from ( [ k2.1.4 ] ) : @xmath95 which implies that @xmath96 for an odd @xmath49 .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath47 is the graph with two vertices and one edge , @xmath97 .",
    "maxim kontsevich found an example of a graph with 4 vertices which has a nonzero weight @xmath79 .",
    "consider firstly a slightly different example , which we will use in the sequel .",
    "* example 1 : * consider the graph @xmath47 shown in figure 2 .",
    "let us compute @xmath79 for this graph .",
    "fix the vertex 2 to the point @xmath98 by the action of group @xmath83 , and let the vertex 3 move along the unit lower half - circle around 2 .",
    "let @xmath99 be the angle of the arrow @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "then we can integrate over positions of the vertices 1 and 4 separately .",
    "let us firstly integrate ( for a fixed @xmath99 ) over 1 , denote it @xmath102 .",
    "we need to compute the integral @xmath103 we use the stokes formula : @xmath104 the stokes formula is applied to the domain @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "there are two boundary strata which contribute to the integral : @xmath108 the first integral in the limit @xmath106 is equal to @xmath109 , and the second one in the limit @xmath107 is equal to @xmath110 .",
    "the total answer is @xmath111 analogously we compute the integral @xmath112 over position of the vertex 4 .",
    "we get the same answer : @xmath113 finally , @xmath114    * example 2 : * more generally , if we have the graph @xmath47 shown in figure 3 , the same computation shows that @xmath115 it is clear that @xmath116 for any @xmath117 .",
    "let @xmath118 are homogeneous polyvector fields .",
    "we are going to define the @xmath49-th taylor component @xmath119 .",
    "first of all , we define with each admissible graph @xmath47 with @xmath49 vertices and the ordered set @xmath118 of polyvector fields a new polyvector field @xmath120 which is @xmath121-vector field .",
    "( here we denote by @xmath122 the lie algebra degree , that is , if @xmath1 is concentrated in the cohomological degree zero , @xmath123 for a @xmath11-vector field @xmath10 ) .",
    "when the target vector space @xmath1 is finite - dimensional , the polyvector field @xmath120 is the sum @xmath124 the polyvector field @xmath125 is the product over the vertices of @xmath47 : @xmath126 where the vertices come in the order fixed by the labeling of the vertices .",
    "each @xmath127 is defined as @xmath128 where @xmath61 is the label of the vertex @xmath58 , and the order in the wedge - product is fixed by the ordering of the set @xmath57 , as above ( see remark in section 2.1 ) .",
    "this completes the definition of @xmath120 for a finite - dimensional vector space @xmath1 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath129 where all graded components @xmath4 are finite - dimensional , as in section 1 .",
    "we leave to the reader the proof of the following lemma :    the polyvector field @xmath120 is well - defined in the infinite - dimensional case of section 1 , when all @xmath130 , and the graph @xmath47 does not contain oriented cycles ( which holds for any admissible graph ) .",
    "now we give our main definition .",
    "define for @xmath51 the polyvector field @xmath131 here @xmath132 is the sum over all permutations of @xmath118 with signs , such that when we permute @xmath133 and @xmath134 the sign @xmath135 appears , and @xmath136 is the set of admissible connected graphs with @xmath49 vertices and @xmath72 edges .",
    "@xmath137 is the schouten - nijenhuis bracket .    in what follows",
    ", we deal with dg lie algebras , and , more generally , @xmath0 algebras . here",
    "we meet some sign problem . indeed , for a dg lie algebra we have two possible notions of skew - commutativity of the bracket : the first is @xmath138_1=(-1)^{\\deg a\\deg b + 1}[b , a]_1 $ ] , and the second is @xmath138_2=(-1)^{(\\deg a+1)(\\deg b+1)}[b , a]_2 $ ] . in what follows we will use the second concept of skew - commutativity .",
    "recall that an @xmath0 algebra structure on a @xmath139-graded vector space @xmath140 is a coderivation @xmath141 of degree + 1 of the free coalgebra @xmath142)$ ] such that @xmath143 .",
    "if @xmath140 is a lie algebra , such a @xmath141 is the differential in the chain complex of the lie algebra @xmath140 .    in coordinates ,",
    "an @xmath0 structure on @xmath140 is the collection of maps ( `` taylor components '' of the @xmath0 morphism ) @xmath144,\\ , n\\ge 1\\ ] ] which satisfy for each @xmath145 the following quadratic equation : @xmath146    turn back now to our polyvector fields @xmath120 .",
    "this polyvector field has degree @xmath147 . when @xmath73 , this degree is @xmath148 , exactly as in ( [ k2.2.5 ] ) .",
    "the maps @xmath149 $ ] are the taylor components of an @xmath0 algebra structure on @xmath7 .",
    "consider the relation ( [ k2.2.6 ] ) for some fixed @xmath150 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath151 where the summation is taken over the admissible connected graphs with @xmath150 vertices and @xmath152 edges ( for 1 edge less than in ( [ k2.2.4 ] ) ) , and @xmath153 are some ( real ) numbers .",
    "we need to prove that @xmath154 for any @xmath155 .    for , consider the integral @xmath156 this integral is clearly equal to 0 , because all 1-forms @xmath77 are closed ( moreover , they are exact ) .",
    "now we want to apply the stokes formula . for this",
    "we need to construct the compactifications @xmath157 of the spaces @xmath53 which is a smooth manifold with corners , and such that the forms @xmath77 can be extended to a smooth forms on @xmath157 .",
    "it can be done in the standard way , see [ k97 ] , section 5 . here",
    "we describe the boundary strata of codimension 1 which are the only strata which contribute to the integrals we consider .",
    "here is the list of the boundary strata of codimension 1 :    * some @xmath158 points @xmath159 among the @xmath49 points approach each other , such that @xmath160 ; in this case let @xmath161 be the restriction of the graph @xmath47 into these @xmath158 points , and let @xmath162 be the graph obtained from contracting of the @xmath158 vertices into a single new vertex .",
    "thus , @xmath161 has @xmath158 vertices , and @xmath162 has @xmath163 vertices . in this case",
    "the boundary stratum is isomorphic to @xmath164 ; * a point @xmath85 connected by an edge @xmath165 is placed on the horizontal line passing through the point @xmath82 .",
    "we continue : @xmath166 only the boundary strata of codimension 1 do contribute to the r.h.s .",
    "the strata of type t2 ) do not contribute because the form @xmath167 vanishes there .",
    "we can therefore consider only the strata of type t1 ) .",
    "for these strata we have the following _ factorization principle : _ it says that the integral over a stratum @xmath168 of type t1 ) is the product : @xmath169 the same factorization holds therefore for the weights @xmath79 .",
    "we get the following identity : @xmath170 where the strata @xmath168 come with its orientation .    the summands in the r.h.s .",
    "are in 1 - 1 correspondence with the summands in ( [ k2.2.6 ] ) which contribute to @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , all @xmath154 .",
    "it follows from lemma 2.1 that this @xmath0 structure has only even non - zero components @xmath171 .",
    "on the other hand , example 2 in section 2.1 shows that the higher components @xmath172 , @xmath173 , are nonzero .",
    "we denote the @xmath0 algebra @xmath7 with the constructed @xmath0 structure by @xmath174 .",
    "we are now ready to state the main result of this paper .",
    "let @xmath175 be a non - negatively graded vector space with @xmath176 .",
    "then there is an @xmath0 morphism from the @xmath0 algebra @xmath174 constructed in section 2.2 to the hochschild complex @xmath18 with the gerstenhaber bracket .",
    "its first taylor component is the hochschild - kostant - rosenberg map .",
    "we have an immediate corollary :    when @xmath1 is finite - dimensional , the @xmath0 algebra @xmath174 on polyvector fields is @xmath0 quasi - isomorphic to the classical one , which is the lie algebra with the schouten - nijenhuis bracket .    by the kontsevich s",
    "formality [ k97 ] , there is an @xmath0 quasi - isomorphism @xmath177 . by our main theorem",
    ", there is an @xmath0 quasi - isomorphism @xmath178 .",
    "it implies that the two @xmath0 structures on polyvector fields are @xmath0 quasi - isomorphic",
    ".    however , for an infinite - dimensional space @xmath1 , the two structures may be completely different .",
    "for example , suppose we have a bivector @xmath179 for an infinite - dimensional @xmath1 .",
    "the right concept what is that @xmath180 is poisson is given by our main theorem as follows :    @xmath181    for a fixed @xmath180 which is polynomial in coordinates the sum is actually finite .",
    "we see , in particular , that if @xmath180 satisfies ( [ k2.3.1 ] ) , the bivector field @xmath182 , @xmath183 , may not satisfy . that is , the equation ( [ k2.3.1 ] ) is not homogeneous .",
    "we call ( [ k2.3.1 ] ) _ the quasi - poisson equation_.    in the case when @xmath180 is a linear bivector field the quasi - poisson equation ( [ k2.3.1 ] ) coincides with the classical one :    let @xmath180 be a linear bivector on @xmath1 .",
    "then the higher components @xmath184 , @xmath173",
    ". that is , ( [ k2.3.1 ] ) is equivalent to the poisson equation @xmath185 .",
    "any admissible graph with @xmath11 vertices which contributes to the @xmath0 algebra @xmath186 has @xmath187 edges .",
    "if @xmath188 it implies that there is at least one vertex with at least two incoming edges .",
    "then the corresponding operator @xmath189 is zero because @xmath180 has linear coefficients .",
    "we expect that there are poisson bivectors which are of degree @xmath190 on an infinite - dimensional vector space which _ are impossible to quantize _ in the sense of deformation quantization .",
    "as the condition ( [ k2.3.1 ] ) is non - homogeneous , our formality theorem gives a deformation quantization only if all @xmath184 separately , so we have a sequence of _ homogeneous _ equations .",
    "we expect that this series of equations gives the _ higher obstructions _ for deformation quantization problem in the infinite - dimensional case .",
    "compute now the first obstruction @xmath191 .",
    "the list of all 7 admissible graphs ( up to the labeling ) with 4 vertices and @xmath192 edges is shown in figure 4 .",
    "their weights are @xmath193 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath196 , respectively .",
    "( here @xmath197 counts the two possible labelings ) .",
    "clearly only @xmath161 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 contribute to @xmath200 , because other graphs has a vertex with 3 outgoing edges .",
    "we get the following equation for the vanishing of the first obstruction in the infinite - dimensional case : @xmath201    when @xmath180 is a _",
    "quadratic _ poisson bivector , only @xmath202 survives because other graphs have a vertex with 3 incoming edges .",
    "then in the quadratic case the first obstruction reads @xmath203",
    "recall that the main configuration space in [ k97 ] is the following space @xmath204 .",
    "first of all , @xmath205 is the configuration space of pairwise distinct points @xmath49 of which belong to the upper half - plane , and the remaining @xmath50 are placed to the real line , which is thought as the boundary of the upper - half plane .",
    "then @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the two - dimensional group of symmetries of the upper half - plane of the form @xmath208 . here",
    "a point @xmath102 of the upper half - plane is considered as a complex number with positive imaginary part .",
    "kontsevich introduces in [ k97 ] some compactification @xmath209 of these spaces and constructs a top degree differential forms on them , depending on a graph @xmath47 .",
    "we refer the reader to [ k97 ] , section 5 , for a detailed description of the compactification .",
    "the top degree differential form on @xmath209 is constructed as follows .",
    "firstly one constructs some closed 1-form @xmath210 on the space @xmath211 ( `` the propagator '' ) .",
    "now suppose that exactly @xmath212 oriented edges of @xmath47 connect our @xmath213 points .",
    "for each edge @xmath214 of @xmath47 we have the forgetful map @xmath215 . now if the 1-form @xmath210 is fixed , we define the top degree form on @xmath209 associated with an admissible graph @xmath47 as @xmath216 ( we should have some ordering of the edges to define this wedge - product of 1-forms ; this ordering is a part of the data of an admissible graph ) .",
    "we see that all the game depends only on the propagator 1-form @xmath210 .",
    "our construction differs from the one from [ k97 ] only by this 1-form @xmath210 . by an admissible graph in this section",
    "we mean almost the kontsevich s admissible graph from [ k97 ] , section 6.1 , without oriented cycles .",
    "let us give a precise definition .",
    "* there are no oriented cycles in @xmath47 ; * the vertices of the first type are labeled by @xmath217 , and the vertices of the second type are labeled by @xmath218 , @xmath219 , we denote for a vertex @xmath58 by @xmath61 its labeling ; this labeling should obey the following property : @xmath220 * each edge starts at a vertex of the first type .    as in section 2",
    ", we do not include an ordering of the sets @xmath57 of outgoing edges from the vertices @xmath58 of @xmath47 in the data of an admissible graph .",
    "the reason is that as soon as the vertices are labeled , there are the canonical orderings by the label of the end - point ; here we count first the end - points which are of the first type , then the end - points of the second type .",
    "recall firstly what the space @xmath211 is .",
    "it looks like an eye ( see the left picture in figure 5 ) .",
    "the two boundary lines comes when one of the two points @xmath221 or @xmath222 approaches the real line , which is the boundary of the upper half - plane .",
    "the circle comes when the two points @xmath221 and @xmath222 approach each other and are far from the real line .",
    "the role of the two points @xmath221 and @xmath222 here is completely symmetric .",
    "now we are going to break this symmetry .",
    "divide the space @xmath211 into two parts , as follows .",
    "let the point @xmath221 be fixed .",
    "draw the half - circle orthogonal to the real line ( a geodesics in the poincar model of hyperbolic geometry ) with @xmath221 as the top point , see figure 6 .",
    "this half - circle is a geodesic , and the group @xmath207 in ( [ 2.1.1 ] ) is the group of symmetries in hyperbolic geometry .",
    "this proves that this half - circle transforms to the analogous half - circle under any @xmath223 .",
    "therefore , the image of this half - circle is well - defined on the eye @xmath211 .",
    "we show this image schematically in figure 5 as the border between the light and the dark parts .",
    "now we want to vanish the 1-form @xmath210 when the oriented pair @xmath224 is in the light area in figure 6 ( @xmath222 is outside the half - circle ) .",
    "we contract all light area in the left picture in figure 5 to a point , and we get the right picture in figure 5 . here",
    "the both vertices from the left picture , and the upper boundary are contracted to a one point , as well as the upper half of the circle .",
    "the entire external boundary in the right picture is formed from the low boundary component on the left picture .",
    "a modified angle function is any map from the modified ( contracted ) @xmath211 to the circle unit @xmath225 such that the internal circle ( in the right picture in figure 5 ) maps isomorphically to @xmath225 as the euclidean @xmath226 , and the external boundary component maps also to @xmath225 ( in the homotopically unique way , with the period @xmath227 ) .",
    "let us recall that the angle function in [ k97 ] , section 6.2 , is a map of the eye from the left picture in figure 5 such that the inner circle maps isomorphically as angle , the upper boundary is contracted to a point , and the lower boundary is mapped with period @xmath228 .",
    "let us emphasize a difference between the two definitions : in our case , any angle function @xmath229 is a function in a proper sense , while in the kontsevich s definition it is a multi - valued function defined only up to @xmath228 .",
    "therefore , in our case the de rham derivative @xmath230 is an exact 1-form , while in the kontsevich s case it is only closed . but",
    "a more serious breakdown is that in our case the propagator @xmath210 is not a smooth function on the manifold with corners @xmath211",
    ". this will be the main source of problems in the next subsection , where we prove the @xmath0 property using the stokes theorem .",
    "this definition has a small defect caused by non - smoothness of the 1-form @xmath210 on @xmath211 .",
    "we advice to the reader skip it for the moment till section 2.2.2 , where we give a rigorous definition of the weights in ( [ 2.2.5 ] ) .",
    "see section 3.1 for our definition of an admissible graph in this section .",
    "let @xmath235 denotes the set of all connected admissible graphs with @xmath49 vertices of the first type , @xmath50 vertices of the second type , and @xmath212 edges .",
    "let @xmath52 , @xmath236 , be the polydifferential operator associated with the graph @xmath47 and polyvector fields @xmath118 , see [ k97 ] , section 6.3 . define @xmath237 where the weight @xmath79 is defined in ( [ 2.1.7 ] ) via the modified angle function .",
    "we have the following two cases : either @xmath47 contains an oriented cycle ( and in this case clearly our @xmath80 ) , or it does not contain ( and in this case @xmath48 is well - defined by lemma 1.4 ) . therefore , the cochain @xmath238 is well - defined .",
    "let @xmath1 be a @xmath234-graded vector space over @xmath2 with finite - dimensional graded components @xmath4 .",
    "then the maps @xmath239 are well - defined and are the taylor components of some @xmath0 quasi - isomorphism @xmath240 where the l.h.s .",
    "is the @xmath0 algebra introduced in section 2 .",
    "its first taylor component @xmath241 is the hochschild - kostant - rosenber map ( [ 1.3.1 ] ) .",
    "the main problem in proving theorem 3.2.1 is that the de rham derivative of the modified angle function is _ not _ a smooth differential form on the compactified space @xmath211 . as a corollary",
    ", we can not apply the stokes formula in the same way as in [ k97 ] .",
    "there are two ways to overcome this problem .",
    "the first one is to subdivide the configuration spaces @xmath209 such that the wedge - product of the angle 1-forms would be a smooth differential form on the subdivision . in particular , it is clear how to subdivide @xmath211 : the subdivision is shown in figure 7 .",
    "this way is , however , not acceptable , because the subdivided spaces are not manifold with corners anymore , and we can not apply the stokes formula as well .    the second way is to define different configuration spaces , cutting off the area when @xmath242 ( see figure 6 ) if one have an edge from @xmath221 to @xmath222 .",
    "the only problem with this solution is that the configuration space will depend on the graph @xmath47 , for each @xmath47 we have its own configuration space .",
    "this solution works , as we will see in the rest of this section .",
    "let @xmath47 be an admissible graph with @xmath49 vertices of the first type and @xmath50 vertices of the second type .",
    "recall that this means , in particular , that all vertices of the first type are ordered and labeled as @xmath217 , and all vertices of the second type are ordered and labeled as @xmath218 .",
    "define the configuration space @xmath243 as follows : @xmath244 here @xmath245 is the upper half - plane , and the relations @xmath246 and @xmath247 in the r.h.s .",
    "are understood in the sense of the ordering with half - circle , shown in figure 6 .",
    "the group @xmath207 in the r.h.s .",
    "consists from the transformations @xmath248 .",
    "let us note that the graph @xmath47 in the definition of @xmath243 may have an arbitrary ( not necessarily @xmath212 ) number of edges .",
    "if @xmath47 has no edges at all , we recognize the kontsevich s original space @xmath204 .",
    "it is easy to construct a kontsevich - type compactification @xmath249 which is a manifold with corners , with projections @xmath250 defined when @xmath251 is a subgraph of @xmath47 .",
    "the space @xmath252 , where @xmath253 is just one oriented edge connecting point 1 with point 2 , is shown in figure 8 .    here the lower component of the boundary comes when the point @xmath222 ( see figure 6 ) approaches the real line , the left and the right upper boundary component comes when the point @xmath222 approaches the left and the right parts of the geodesic half - circle in figure 6 , and the third upper boundary component ( the half - circle ) comes when @xmath222 approaches @xmath221 inside the geodesic half - circle .",
    "a modified angle function is a map @xmath229 of @xmath252 to a unit circle @xmath225 such that @xmath229 is the euclidean angle varying from @xmath254 to 0 on the upper half - circle , and @xmath229 contracts the two other upper boundary components to a point @xmath255 .",
    "now we define for an edge @xmath214 of an admissible graph @xmath47 the 1-form @xmath77 on @xmath249 as @xmath259 , where @xmath253 is the graph with two vertices and one edge @xmath214 .",
    "finally , we give a rigorous definition of the weight :          * some points @xmath261 , @xmath262 , approach each other and remain far from the geodesic half - circles of all points @xmath263 connected by an edge with any of the approaching @xmath158 points . in this case",
    "we get the boundary stratum of codimension 1 isomorphic to @xmath264 where @xmath162 is the subgraph of @xmath47 of the edges connecting the point @xmath265 with each other , and @xmath161 is obtained from @xmath47 by collapsing the graph @xmath162 into a new vertex ; * some points @xmath261 and some points @xmath266 , @xmath267 , @xmath268 , approach each other and a point of the real line , but are far from the geodesic half - circle of any other point connected with these points by an edge . in this case we get a boundary stratum of codimension 1 isomorphic to @xmath269 where @xmath161 is the graph formed from the edges between the approaching points , and @xmath162 is obtained from @xmath47 by collapsing the subgraph @xmath161 into a new vertex of the second type ; * some point @xmath82 is placed on the geodesic half - circle of exactly one point @xmath270 which is far from @xmath82 , such there is an edge @xmath271 .",
    "these boundary strata will be irrelevant for us because they do not contribute to the integrals we consider .",
    "we need to prove the @xmath0 morphism quadratic relations on the maps @xmath239 .",
    "recall , that for each @xmath272 and for any polyvector fields @xmath273 it is the relation : @xmath274=\\\\ & = 0 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the l.h.s . of ( [ 2.2.10 ] ) is a sum over the admissible graphs @xmath275 with @xmath49 vertices of the first type , @xmath50 vertices of the second type , and @xmath276 egdes ( that is , for 1 edge less than in the graphs contributing to @xmath239 ) .",
    "this sum is of the form : @xmath277 where @xmath278 are some complex numbers , and @xmath279 are the kontsevich s polydifferential operators from [ k97 ] . _",
    "it is clear that all @xmath279 do not contain any oriented cycle_.      each @xmath278 is a quadratic - linear combination of our weights @xmath281 for @xmath282 .",
    "there is a way how one can get some quadratic - linear combinations of @xmath79 which are equal to 0 .",
    "this way is the following :    consider some @xmath275 .",
    "we associated with it a differential form @xmath283 on @xmath284 , as before .",
    "now consider @xmath285 this expression is 0 because the form @xmath286 is closed ( moreover , it is exact ) .",
    "next , by the stokes theorem , we have @xmath287 now only strata of codimension 1 in @xmath288 do contribute to the r.h.s .",
    "they are given by the list s1)-s3 ) in section 3.2.2 .",
    "the summand @xmath293 corresponds exactly to the first and to the third summands of the l.h.s . of ( [ 2.2.10 ] ) containing the hochschild differential and the gerstenhaber bracket , by the factorization lemma .",
    "it remains to associate the boundary strata s1 ) with the second summand of ( [ 2.2.10 ] ) , containing operations @xmath294 .",
    "it is clear that the part of the second summand of ( [ 2.2.10 ] ) for a fixed @xmath150 is in 1 - 1 correspondence with that summands in @xmath295 where @xmath296 points in the upper half - plane approach each other .    in [ k97 ] where this kind of computation is originated analogous strata of type @xmath297 give vanishing integrals for @xmath298 .",
    "this is why kontsevich gets the formality theorem there .",
    "this vanishing is proven by a rather non - trivial computation . as we have seen in section 2.1 , examples 1 and 2 ,",
    "the analogous vanishing fails for our construction .",
    "i am very grateful to borya feigin for sharing with me around 98-99 some his conjecture which stimulated my work on the infinite - dimensional formality in general .",
    "maxim kontsevich found a mistake in lemma 2.2.4 of the previous version which failed theorem 2.2.4 of that version .",
    "this problem is fixed here by introduction of a new @xmath0 structure on polyvector fields in section 2 .",
    "i am very grateful to maxim for his interest in my work and for fruitful correspondence .",
