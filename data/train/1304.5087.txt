    "suppose you have encrypted some data , you intend to compute with the data , but you do not want to decrypt them . is it possible to compute with the encrypted data without decryption ?",
    "this problem is related with the study `` information processing with encrypted data '' or `` privacy - preserving quantum computing '' .",
    "it has been investigated a lot in modern cryptography , and includes the studies of homomorphic encryption @xcite and blind computing @xcite .",
    "it was first considered by rivest et al . who suggest some homomorphic encryption schemes @xcite .",
    "however , these schemes are insecure @xcite . later",
    ", more results are proposed about homomorphic encryption and fully homomorphic encryption @xcite .",
    "these are constructed based on some hard computational problems in mathematics , and their security relies on the computational difficulty of these mathematical problems .",
    "thus they have just computational security .",
    "in addition , symmetric homomorphic encryption @xcite is also an useful and interesting research , and it has higher efficiency . though its encryption key is the same as the decryption key , it is sufficient for many application .    based on the theory of quantum mechanics , lots of quantum cryptographic protocols @xcite have been proposed , and have unconditional security .",
    "this stimulates us to consider the above problem in the context of quantum information , and intend to get a more secure solution to the privacy - preserving quantum computing .",
    "the closely related with the problem includes : 1 ) blind quantum computing @xcite , where one party delegates quantum computation to another party without revealing his data and result ; 2 ) quantum homomorphic encryption ( qhe ) @xcite , which allows quantum data to be manipulated without decrypting ; 3 ) quantum private query @xcite , which is used to query a database while keeping the query secret ; and 4 ) quantum private comparison @xcite , which allows two parties to compare their secret data without revealing the secret .",
    "this paper considers the problem of homomorphic encryption in the context of quantum information processing : suppose arbitrary quantum plaintext @xmath1 has been encrypted ( the ciphertext is @xmath2 ) , can we perform any quantum operator directly on the ciphertext ( without decrypting the ciphertext ) and obtain the desired state @xmath3 ?",
    "the state @xmath3 is the ciphertext of the result of performing quantum operator @xmath4 on the original plaintext @xmath1 .",
    "rohde et al .",
    "@xcite studied quantum walk with encrypted data , and proposed a limited qhe scheme using the boson sampling and multi - walker quantum walk models .",
    "this qhe scheme can be used in blind computing of quantum walk . however , qhe has still not been defined and quantum fully homomorphic encryption ( qfhe ) scheme has not been constructed .",
    "we study the quantum information processing with encrypted data from the aspect of qhe .",
    "the definitions of qhe and qfhe have been presented , and some concrete schemes including qfhe scheme have been constructed .",
    "all these schemes are constructed based on quantum one - time pad ( qotp ) @xcite , and have perfect security .",
    "@xcite , a limited qhe scheme was presented using the boson sampling and multi - walker quantum walk models .",
    "however , no definition of qhe or qfhe has been given , and no qfhe scheme has been constructed .",
    "qhe can be either symmetric or asymmetric",
    ". both of the two kinds will be defined , but we will focus on the symmetric qhe .",
    "all the schemes constructed in the next sections are symmetric qhe schemes .",
    "quantum states are usually written in the form of density matrices , denoted as @xmath5 .",
    "the output states of quantum operators @xmath6 are also represented as density matrices .    * definition 1 : * a symmetric quantum homomorphic encryption scheme @xmath7 has the following four algorithms :    1 .",
    "key generating algorithm @xmath8 is used to generate a key @xmath9 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath10 is the encryption algorithm : @xmath11 , where @xmath1 is the quantum plaintext ; 3 .",
    "@xmath12 is the decryption algorithm : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the quantum ciphertext ; 4 .",
    "the algorithm @xmath15 is used to process the quantum ciphertext without decryption .",
    "@xmath15 is associated to a set @xmath16 of permitted quantum operators . for any quantum operator @xmath17 , according to the key @xmath9 and quantum ciphertext @xmath14 , it performs the algorithm @xmath18 , and can output a quantum state which is just the ciphertext @xmath19 .",
    "it should be noticed that there exists a case that the algorithm @xmath15 is independent of the key . in this case",
    ", it should be written as @xmath20 in the above definition .",
    "so , the symmetric qhe can be divided into two classes : 1 ) symmetric qhe with encryption key , where the algorithm @xmath15 is executed using the encryption key ; and 2 ) symmetric qhe without encryption key , where the algorithm @xmath15 is executed without using the encryption key .    * definition 2 : * an asymmetric quantum homomorphic encryption scheme @xmath7 has the following four algorithms :    1 .",
    "key generating algorithm @xmath8 is used to generate two keys  a public key @xmath21 and a secret key @xmath22 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath10 is the encryption algorithm : @xmath23 , where @xmath1 is the quantum plaintext ; 3 .",
    "@xmath12 is the decryption algorithm : @xmath24 , where @xmath14 is the quantum ciphertext ; 4 .",
    "the algorithm @xmath15 is used to process the quantum ciphertext without decryption .",
    "@xmath15 is associated to a set @xmath16 of permitted quantum operators . for any quantum operator @xmath17 , according to the public key @xmath21 and quantum ciphertext @xmath14 , it performs the algorithm @xmath25 , and can output a quantum ciphertext which can be decrypted as @xmath26 with the secret key @xmath22 .    compared with the usual encryption scheme ,",
    "the qhe scheme has a fourth algorithm @xmath15 , which is used to process the encrypted data .",
    "for example , the algorithm @xmath15 may be described as this : from the key and the quantum operator @xmath17 , it generates another quantum operator @xmath27 and performs it on the quantum ciphertext @xmath28 . in this case , the operator @xmath27 is related with the operator @xmath4 and the key , such that @xmath29 the operator @xmath4 can be regarded as an desired operation on the quantum plaintext .",
    "the operation @xmath27 corresponding to @xmath4 is performed on the quantum ciphertext , and can implement the desired operation on the plaintext .    from the definitions of symmetrc / asymmetric qhe scheme ,",
    "we say the scheme @xmath7 can handle all the quantum operators in @xmath16 .",
    "the scheme @xmath7 is ( symmetric or asymmetric ) quantum fully homomorphic encryption scheme , if it can handle all quantum operators and @xmath15 is efficient in a similar way as in ref.@xcite",
    ". the quantum operator @xmath17 may be uncomputable in polynomial time , and suppose its running time is @xmath30 .",
    "we say @xmath15 is efficient if there exists a polynomial @xmath31 such that , for any quantum operator @xmath17 that can be implemented in time @xmath30 , @xmath15 can be implemented in time at most @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the security parameter .",
    "the security of qhe scheme depends on the security of the encryption algorithm @xmath10 . in the asymmetric qhe scheme ,",
    "the security also depends on the privacy of the secret key @xmath22 while the key @xmath21 is public .",
    "some operators are introduced firstly .",
    "four single - qubit operators @xmath34 are shown as follows : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "two - qubit operator controlled - not is denoted as @xmath39 .",
    "the rotation operators about the @xmath40 and @xmath41 axes are defined by @xmath42 and @xmath43 . see the appendix for some of their commutation rules .",
    "all the equations used in this paper can be deduced from those commutation rules .    in this section",
    ", we will firstly present three qhe schemes on single qubit , whose permitted quantum operators are in the set @xmath44 , @xmath45 or the union of them .",
    "then a qhe scheme for @xmath39 is also constructed .    in the first qhe scheme ,",
    "the set of permitted quantum operators is @xmath44 .",
    "the scheme is shown as follows .",
    "* qhe scheme 1 * : : @xmath8 : : :    randomly select two bits @xmath46 ; @xmath10 : : :    compute @xmath47 ; @xmath12 : : :    compute @xmath48 ; @xmath15 : : :    according to @xmath49 , it performs quantum    operator @xmath50 on the given quantum ciphertext    @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "it can be verified that @xmath53 where @xmath46 . according to eq.([equ2 ] ) , the output state of the algorithm @xmath15 is @xmath54 which is just the ciphertext of the state @xmath55 . moreover , no decryption is performed during the computing of @xmath15 . thus the scheme satisfies the definition of symmetric qhe , and all the unitary transformations in @xmath44 are permitted quantum operators of the qhe scheme .    in the second qhe scheme ,",
    "the set of permitted quantum operators is @xmath45 .",
    "the scheme is shown as follows .",
    "* qhe scheme 2 * : : @xmath8 : : :    randomly select two bits @xmath46 ; @xmath10 : : :    compute @xmath47 ; @xmath12 : : :    compute @xmath48 ; @xmath15 : : :    according to @xmath56 , it performs quantum    operator @xmath57 on the given quantum ciphertext    @xmath51 , where @xmath58 .",

    "remark 1 : * the relation @xmath62 can be easily verified .",
    "so , in the qhe scheme 2 , the encryption / decryption algorithm can also be modified by replacing @xmath63 with @xmath64 , and the algorithm @xmath15 performs quantum operator @xmath65 on the given quantum ciphertext .",
    "the third qhe scheme can be constructed by combining the scheme 1 and scheme 2 , and its permitted quantum operators are in @xmath66 .",
    "the only modification is about the algorithm @xmath15 , and the modified @xmath15 is described as follow : according to the key @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( or @xmath69 ) , perform quantum operator @xmath70 ( or @xmath71 ) on the given quantum ciphertext @xmath51 .    until now ,",
    "we have presented three symmetric qhe schemes , such that the permitted quantum operators are in @xmath44 , @xmath45 , or the union of them .",
    "all these schemes are constructed based on qotp . in these constructions ,",
    "each permitted quantum operator @xmath72 is corresponding to another quantum operator @xmath27 which is directly performed on the quantum ciphertext . finding the operator @xmath27 is the key point to construct a qhe scheme .",
    "next , we construct a symmetric qhe scheme that permits @xmath39 operator .",
    "it can be verified that @xmath73 where @xmath74 are arbitrary four bits .",
    "denote @xmath75 , then the eq.([equ1 ] ) can be written as @xmath76 , so the operator @xmath77 is corresponding to @xmath39 . from this relation ,",
    "the qhe scheme can be constructed in the same way as follows . in the encryption / decryption algorithm ,",
    "the qotp is used to encrypt / decrypt two qubits with @xmath78-bit key @xmath74 . according to the key @xmath74 , the algorithm @xmath15 performs @xmath77 on the given quantum ciphertext .",
    "based on the qhe schemes in the previous section , the qfhe scheme can also be constructed for any @xmath0-qubit quantum computation ( without quantum measurements ) .    from the ref .",
    "@xcite , any single - qubit unitary transformation can be written as the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 are real numbers in the @xmath81 .",
    "it means all the single - qubit unitary transformations can be expressed as the set @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .    according to eq.([equ2 ] ) and eq.([equ3 ] )",
    ", it can be concluded that @xmath84 where @xmath46 .    from eq.([equ5 ] ) , any single - qubit unitary operator @xmath85 is corresponding to @xmath86 .",
    "so the qfhe scheme for single - qubit computation is constructed in the same way as the construction of qhe schemes in the previous section .",
    "* qfhe on single qubit * : : @xmath8 : : :    randomly select two bits @xmath46 ; @xmath10 : : :    compute @xmath47 ; @xmath12 : : :    compute @xmath48 ; @xmath15 : : :    according to @xmath67 and    @xmath85 , it performs the unitary    transformation    @xmath86 on    the given quantum ciphertext @xmath51 .    according to eq.([equ5 ] ) , the output state of the algorithm @xmath15 is @xmath87 thus the scheme also satisfies the definition of symmetric qhe .",
    "moreover , @xmath15 has the same computational complexity with the quantum operator @xmath88 , and the set @xmath82 contains all of the single - qubit unitary transformations , so the above qhe scheme is fully homomorphic for single - qubit computation .    notice that while intending to perform any given unitary operator on a quantum ciphertext , the unitary operator should be firstly decomposed into the form of eq.([equ4 ] ) ( or computing the four parameters @xmath80 ) .",
    "next , we present another scheme , which will be shown to be a qfhe scheme , and permits any @xmath0-qubit unitary transformation .",
    "any @xmath0-qubit unitary transformation can be decomposed as the combination of some @xmath39 and single - qubit unitary transformations . then any @xmath0-qubit computation ( without quantum measurements )",
    "can be described as a quantum circuit @xmath89 , which consists of some @xmath39 and single - qubit unitary gates @xcite . from the above constructions of qhe schemes , the @xmath39 gate or each single - qubit unitary gates @xmath85 can correspond to another quantum gate @xmath77 or @xmath86 . by replacing each gate in quantum circuit @xmath89 with the corresponding quantum gate",
    ", we can obtain a new quantum circuit , denoted as @xmath90 .",
    "the two quantum circuits @xmath89 and @xmath90 satisfy the relation @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are arbitrary @xmath0-bit strings selected from @xmath94 .",
    "the circuit @xmath90 is dependent on the circuit @xmath89 and the two numbers @xmath95 .    from eq.([equ6 ] ) , the qfhe on @xmath0 qubits can be constructed as follows .",
    "qotp is used as the encryption / decryption algorithms again , and it needs a @xmath96-bit key to pefectly encrypt @xmath0-qubit plaintext , and obtains an @xmath0-qubit ciphertext . according to the key , the algorithm @xmath15 replaces each gate in quantum circuit @xmath89 with its corresponding gate , and gets a new quantum circuit @xmath90 , and then puts the @xmath0-qubit ciphertext as the inputs of @xmath90 .",
    "the output state of @xmath90 can just be decrypted according to qotp , and get the result of performing quantum circuit @xmath89 on the original plaintext .",
    "thus , this qfhe scheme permits any @xmath0-qubit unitary circuit @xmath89 to be performed on @xmath0 qubits that have been encrypted , and no decryption is needed .",
    "next , the size of quantum circuit @xmath90 is analyzed . from the relation @xmath75 , the gate @xmath77 can be implemented by at most @xmath97 quantum gates ( e.g. @xmath98 ) .",
    "so , while constructing the new quantum circuit @xmath90 , each @xmath39 gate in the circuit @xmath89 is replaced with at most @xmath97 quantum gates . on the other hand ,",
    "each single - qubit gate in @xmath90 is only corresponding to @xmath99 single - qubit gate .",
    "then , we can conclude that , the size of the new circuit @xmath90 is not more than three times of the size of @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the complexity of @xmath15 is at most three times than that of the circuit @xmath89 , and then the algorithm @xmath15 is efficient .",
    "it follows from the above analysis that , this scheme is indeed a qfhe scheme , which permits any @xmath0-qubit unitary transformation .",
    "the security of these qhe and qfhe schemes is analyzed .",
    "* theorem 1 : * all the qhe and qfhe schemes proposed in the previous sections are perfectly secure .",

    "suppose the single - qubit plaintext @xmath102 is encrypted by qotp using secret key @xmath103 , which is unknown to the attacker .",
    "with regard to the attacker , the output of the algorithm @xmath10 is @xmath104 , which is just the totally mixed state according to eq.([equ7 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the output of @xmath15 with regard to the attacker is @xmath105 which is also the totally mixed state .",
    "similarly , the same result can be obtained for the @xmath0-qubit qfhe scheme .",
    "thus , with regard to the attacker , the outputs of the algorithms @xmath10 and @xmath15 in each qhe / qfhe scheme are totally mixed states .",
    "it means these qhe and qfhe schemes are also perfectly secure , and the attacker can obtain nothing about the plaintext and the result of evaluation .",
    "@xmath106    all the qhe schemes presented here are constructed based on qotp .",
    "it should be noticed that , the algorithm @xmath15 is dependent on the secret key .",
    "this may restrict the application of these schemes , because only the owner of the secret key can process the encrypted qubits correctly .",
    "does there exist a qotp - based symmetric qhe scheme , in which the algorithm @xmath15 is independent of the secret key ?",
    "next , we can present a positive answer to this question .",
    "for convenient , suppose @xmath89 is a permitted unitary operator in the qhe scheme , and @xmath90 is the unitary operator which corresponds to @xmath89 .",
    "the algorithm @xmath15 performs @xmath90 on the ciphertext @xmath107 , and can get the result @xmath108 .",
    "* lemma 1 : * in the qotp - based qhe scheme , if the operator @xmath90 is independent of the secret key , and satisfies the condition @xmath109 , then @xmath110 .",

    "@xmath106    because the global phase in a quantum state does not influence the result of measurement ( the global phase has no influence on the density matrix ) , the condition in lemma 1 can be relaxed as this : @xmath128 , where @xmath129 depends on @xmath112 .",
    "* lemma 2 : * in the qotp - based qhe scheme , if the operator @xmath90 is independent of the secret key , and satisfies the condition @xmath128 , then all the operators in @xmath130 are permitted unitary operators .",

    "@xmath106    from the two lemmas , we can conclude the following result .",

    "however , it is obvious that it can not be fully homomorphic .",
    "there is another point that is worth to notice .",
    "it can be concluded from eq.([equ8 ] ) that , given any @xmath4 , if the encryption algorithm @xmath133 is replaced by another encryption algorithm @xmath134 , then the operation @xmath27 will changes accordingly .",
    "the relationship between @xmath27 and @xmath4 depends on the encryption algorithm @xmath133 . in all our schemes",
    ", qotp is chosen as the encryption algorithm , and this makes for our simple constructions .",
    "the symmetric qfhe scheme has been constructed .",
    "suppose you have encrypted a qubit with this scheme , you can perform any single - qubit unitary operator on the qubit without decryption .",
    "if you intend to delegate the unitary operator to another party , you have to preshare the key with that party , thus that party may decrypt it and obtain the original qubit .",
    "so the symmetric qfhe scheme proposed here can not be used in blind computing .",
    "however , you can still delegate the computation to the trusted party by using the qfhe scheme , which can prevent the malicious parties from obtaining the data and the result of computation .",

    "ttp performs quantum circuit @xmath90 ( which is relative to @xmath89 and all the keys shared between ttp and every party ) on all the ciphertexts , and sends back the results to each party .",
    "then each party can decrypt the received state with his secret key , and obtain the desired result .",
    "besides the homomorphic encryption , blind computing is another kind of study about privacy - preserving computation . actually , homomorphic encryption and blind computing are two closely related research directions .",
    "homomorphic encryption scheme can be used in blind computing in the following two cases : ( 1 ) homomorphic encryption scheme is symmetric , and the algorithm @xmath15 is independent of the key @xmath9 ; ( 2 ) homomorphic encryption scheme is asymmetric . in blind computing ,",
    "the decryption @xmath135 is unnecessarily the inverse of the encryption @xmath136 ( see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "however , in the homomorphic encryption scheme , the decryption algorithm is just the inverse of the encryption algorithm .    in the qfhe scheme ,",
    "@xmath96 bits of key are needed to encrypt @xmath0 qubits with perfect security . to reduce the length of key",

    "if this goal were achieved , the computing on the quantum ciphertext could be securely outsourced , and then the blind quantum computing would be implemented in this way .",
    "this paper defines symmetric and asymmetric qhe , and proposes four symmetric qhe schemes that permit all the quantum operators in the set @xmath44 , @xmath45 or @xmath137 .",
