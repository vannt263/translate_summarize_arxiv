    "a number of different topological defects @xcite are thought to have been formed during the phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "depending on the topology of the vacuum manifold @xmath0 these are domain walls , strings , monopoles and textures corresponding to the homotopy groups @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . cosmic strings @xcite have always gained a lot of interest since they are thought to be important for the structure formation in the universe due to their huge energy per unit length ( roughly @xmath5 for a string formed at gut scale @xmath6 ) .",
    "a classical field theory model which has string - like solutions is the abelian higgs model @xcite .",
    "these solutions , also sometimes called `` vortices '' , correspond to infinitely long objects .",
    "they have a core radius inverse proportional to the higgs boson mass and magnetic flux tubes with radius proportional to the inverse of the gauge boson mass .",
    "coupling the abelian higgs model minimally to gravity , the influence of the vortex on the geometry of space - time was investigated analytically @xcite .",
    "it was shown that far away from the core of the string the space - time is minkowski minus a wedge .",
    "it was also realised @xcite that if the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field is sufficiently large ( corresponding to strings having formed at a phase transition with energy scale much higher than the gut scale ) , then a different type of solution is possible .",
    "these so - called `` supermassive strings '' exist only on a finite interval of the radial coordinate and have a curvature singularity at the maximal value of the radial coordinate .",
    "the existence of further solutions was investigated in a detailed numerical analysis @xcite .",
    "it was found that the parameter space is indeed divided by the curve of maximal angular deficit @xmath7 .",
    "if the deficit is smaller than @xmath7 , so - called `` open '' , i.e. infinitely extended solutions were found .",
    "one is the above mentioned cosmic string solution @xcite which however has a `` shadow '' solution of melvin - type for all values of the coupling constants . for deficit large than @xmath7 , only the `` supermassive '' , `` closed '' solutions exist @xcite .",
    "the static solutions of the model without gauge field , so - called global strings , have also been studied @xcite .",
    "like all global defects , the global string has a long - range goldstone field which leads to a divergent energy .",
    "moreover , the global string is characterised by a logarithmically divergent deficit angle in contrast to the local string which has a constant deficit angle .",
    "the coupling to gravity in the case of the static global monopole leads to a singularity - free monopole solution @xcite in the sense that while the energy is still linearly divergent , the solid deficit angle is now finite . for the static global string",
    "the corresponding singularity can not be removed by coupling the system to gravity and only the assumption that the metric be time - dependent removes the singularity @xcite .    since a number of astrophysical observations like e.g.",
    "the measurement of redshifts of type ia supernovae @xcite has led scientists to believe that we live in a universe with positive cosmological constant , the study of topological defects in de sitter ( ds ) space seems interesting .",
    "but it also is of interest from another point of view , namely the ds / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "this correspondence suggests a holographic duality between gravity in a @xmath8-dimensional ds space and a conformal field theory ( cft ) `` living '' on the boundary of the ds spacetime and thus being @xmath9-dimensional .",
    "recently , nielsen - olesen strings in the background of a @xmath10-dimensional de sitter spacetime @xmath11 have been studied @xcite . however , to our knowledge , the _ full _ system of coupled matter and metric field equations has not been studied yet .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is the investigation of exactly this point .",
    "motivated by some recent work on a composite system of a global and local monopole in curved space - time @xcite , we investigate the composite system of a global and nielsen - olesen string in a curved space - time with cosmological constant as well .    our paper is organised as follows : we give the model and static , cylindrically symmetric ansatz in section 2 . we give the equations of motion in section 3 .",
    "we discuss the pure nielsen - olesen solutions in section 4 , the global string solutions in section 5 and the composite system of a global and nielsen - olesen string in section 6 .",
    "we give our summary in section 7 .",
    "the model which describes a gravitating nielsen - olesen string interacting with a global one in the presence of a non - vanishing cosmological constant is given by the following action :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the ricci scalar , @xmath14 denotes newton s constant and @xmath15 is the cosmological constant .",
    "the lagrangian of the abelian higgs model is given by @xcite : @xmath16 with the covariant derivative @xmath17 and the field strength @xmath18 of the u(1 ) gauge potential @xmath19 with coupling constant @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is a complex scalar field ( the higgs field ) with vacuum expectation value @xmath22 and self - coupling constant @xmath23 .",
    "the lagrangian of the global string reads @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a complex scalar field ( the goldstone field ) with vacuum expectation value @xmath26 and self - coupling @xmath27 .",
    "finally , following @xcite we introduce an extra potential which couples ( with coupling constant @xmath28 ) the two sectors of the model directly to each other : @xmath29 without this term , the global and local string would be coupled only indirectly over gravity . in this paper",
    "we will use units which @xmath30      in the following we shall analyse the classical equations of motion associated with the above system . in order to do that ,",
    "let us write down the matter and gravitational fields as shown below .",
    "the most general , cylindrically symmetric line element invariant under boosts along the @xmath31direction is : @xmath32 the non - vanishing components of the einstein tensor @xmath33 then read : @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath36 .    for the matter and gauge fields",
    ", we have : @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 are integers indexing the vorticity of the higgs and goldstone fields , respectively , around the @xmath31axis .    substituting the above configurations into the matter lagrangian density @xmath42",
    ", we obtain : @xmath43",
    "we define the following dimensionless variable and function : @xmath44 then , the total lagrangian only depends on the following dimensionless coupling constants @xmath45    varying ( [ action ] ) with respect to the matter fields and metric functions , we obtain a system of five non - linear differential equations .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for the matter field functions read : @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 while the einstein equations @xmath49 read : @xmath50\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath51\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , defining @xmath52 we get the following equation : @xmath53 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the prime now denotes the derivatives with respect to @xmath54 .",
    "the requirement of regularity at the origin leads to the following boundary conditions : @xmath55 for the matter fields and @xmath56 for the metric fields .",
    "since a cosmological horizon appears naturally in de sitter space , we integrate the equations only up to this value of the coordinate @xmath54 , @xmath57 . in order for the core of the local string to lie completely within the horizon we require : @xmath58 note that due to the fact that the @xmath54 interval is finite , this is not ( like in asymptotically flat space ) a necessary condition for finite energy solutions .",
    "however , we have chosen these boundary conditions such that the energy - momentum tensor vanishes at @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , the limit @xmath59 which leads to @xmath60 can be taken with these boundary conditions .",
    "first , we are interested in the case of the pure nielsen - olesen string",
    ". this corresponds to setting @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the previous equations .      for the case of the pure gauge string",
    ", there is a vacuum solution of the equations . setting @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    ", we find from ( [ ueq ] ) , that : @xmath65 using the boundary conditions ( [ zero ] ) , we find the following solution : @xmath66 this then can be put into ( [ n1 ] ) and ( [ n2 ] ) and we find the solutions : @xmath67 and @xmath68^{1/3}[\\tan(\\sqrt{3\\bar\\lambda } \\frac{x}{2})]^{2/3 } \\label{nol}\\ ] ] where the coefficients again result from the boundary conditions ( [ zero ] ) .",
    "the first zero of @xmath69 lies at @xmath70 . at the same time ,",
    "this is the cosmological horizon of the vacuum solution .",
    "if we expand the metric functions around this horizon , we obtain : @xmath72 and @xmath73 this has the behaviour of a so - called kasner solution @xcite : @xmath74 with @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "these type of `` closed '' solutions have been found previously @xcite for the case @xmath79 and were called `` supermassive '' strings .",
    "when calculating the kretschmann scalar @xmath80 one obtains @xcite that @xmath81 and thus the solution has indeed a curvature singularity at @xmath82 .",
    "remarkable is that in the case of @xmath79 , these type of solutions only appear for sufficiently high vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of the higgs field corresponding to strings having formed at energy scales much higher than the gut scale @xcite . for smaller values of the vev",
    "no singularity appears and the solutions exist on the full interval @xmath83 .",
    "accordingly , the numerical study showed @xcite that these solutions exist for a @xmath84 .",
    "subject to the boundary conditions ( [ zero ] ) , we have studied the coupled system of equations numerically .    first , we fixed @xmath85 and @xmath86 to study the influence of the gravitational coupling @xmath87 on the solutions .",
    "we determined the value of @xmath54 at which the metric function @xmath69 vanishes , i.e. @xmath88 . our results for @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , @xmath92 are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "as expected the value of @xmath93 decreases with increasing gravitational coupling @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , we observe a steep decrease in @xmath93 for a relatively small range of @xmath87 .",
    "we have only plotted results for @xmath87 s corresponding to @xmath94 since for large @xmath87 s the numerics becomes increasingly difficult .",
    "the reason for this is indicated in fig .  2 , where we show the profiles of the metric functions @xmath69 , @xmath95 as well as those of the matter field functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 for @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and two different choices of @xmath87 .",
    "for @xmath98 , the value of @xmath54 at which the matter field functions reach their asymptotic values @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively , is much smaller than the value of @xmath93 .",
    "this means that the horizon clearly lies outside the core of the string . for @xmath101",
    ", however , the situation is different .",
    "the value of @xmath54 at which @xmath97 reaches @xmath100 is roughly equal to @xmath93 , while @xmath96 seems to be still greater than @xmath99 on the plot we present .",
    "this is due to the fact that the `` real '' solution would have a slightly higher @xmath93 at which @xmath102 .",
    "however , since @xmath103 , it is numerically impossible to reach the final solution .",
    "nevertheless , the plot indicates that -like @xmath97- @xmath96 just reaches its asymptotic value @xmath99 at @xmath57 .",
    "thus the horizon lies very close to the core of the string",
    ".    then , we fixed @xmath85 and @xmath87 and determined @xmath93 in dependence on @xmath86 .",
    "our results for @xmath104 and @xmath91 , @xmath92 together with the location of the cosmological horizon of the vacuum solution , @xmath105 , are given in fig .",
    "we clearly observe that the value of the cosmological horizon decreases with the increase of the cosmological constant , as expected .",
    "moreover , an increase in the vorticity @xmath40 leads to a decrease of @xmath93 for the same @xmath86 . for small @xmath86 , @xmath93 of both the @xmath91 and the @xmath106 solution",
    "is very close to the corresponding @xmath105 .",
    "this can again be explained by studying the behaviour of the matter field functions for varying @xmath107 . as observed previously @xcite",
    ", we find that for fixed @xmath85 and @xmath87 and increasing @xmath107 , the value of the coordinate @xmath54 at which the matter field functions reach their asymptotic values also increases , e.g. for @xmath104 , @xmath106 we find that for @xmath108 the value of @xmath54 , where the gauge field function reaches @xmath109 is @xmath110 , while for @xmath111 , we find @xmath112 .",
    "this can be interpreted as representing a thicker string core due to an increased cosmological expansion .",
    "thus the cosmological horizon lies closer and closer to the core of the string for increasing @xmath86 and so only for small @xmath86 the solution close to the cosmological horizon can be described by the vacuum solution . in fig .  4",
    ", we show the profiles of @xmath69 and @xmath95 for @xmath113 , @xmath104 and @xmath106 both for the nielsen - olesen string and the vacuum solution .",
    "clearly , the solutions differ quite strongly .",
    "this is the case of setting @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( which implies @xmath116 ) . the global string without a cosmological constant , i.e.",
    "@xmath79 has been studied extensively @xcite . to have a good starting solution for the construction of ds global strings ,",
    "we have reconstructed the global string without cosmological constant .",
    "we find that the metric function @xmath69 deviates very little from one , but that the quantity @xmath117 is increasing with @xmath118 .",
    "moreover , @xmath95 grows approximately linearly with @xmath54 .",
    "this is the behaviour found in @xcite , namely that outside the core of the global string the metric functions behave like @xmath119 , @xmath120 with @xmath121 being the core of the global string in our rescaled coordinates .",
    "moreover , we recover the behaviour of the goldstone field function @xmath122 .      for non - vanishing cosmological",
    "constant we find that the behaviour of @xmath69 and @xmath95 resembles that of the metric functions in the case of the nielsen - olesen string in de sitter space ( see previous section ) .",
    "again , for all constants fixed and @xmath86 varied , we find that the value at which @xmath88 decreases with increasing @xmath86 , e.g. for @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , we find that @xmath126 , while @xmath127 . at the same time , the value of @xmath54 at which the function @xmath128 reaches its vev increases with increasing @xmath86 which is due to the increased cosmological expansion thus leading to an extended string core .",
    "the behaviour of the function @xmath128 depends crucially on the cosmological constant which determines the cosmological horizon and the parameters @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which determine the radius of the string core .",
    "we will discuss these features in more detail in the context of composite topological defects in the next section .",
    "unlike in the case of the `` pure '' nielsen - olesen string , a complete analytical analysis of the composite system seems to be impossible .",
    "however , some additional information can be gained by analysing the energy density per unit length . before discussing our numerical results",
    ", we make some remarks on this point in the following section .",
    "the energy density per unit length of the composite defect is given by @xcite : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the determinant of the @xmath133 dimensional metric @xmath134 and @xmath135 is the @xmath136-component of the energy - momentum tensor . in the cylindrical coordinates , we get : @xmath137 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this , we can observe that the composite defect has a finite energy density .",
    "there are two different scenarios now .",
    "if the product @xmath138 is large enough the core of the global string is small and the cores of both strings lie within the cosmological horizon @xmath93 .",
    "we can then assume that @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 . from before , we know that @xmath95 goes to infinity close to the horizon , while @xmath143 remains finite .",
    "thus the integrand of ( [ e ] ) tends to zero like @xmath144 .",
    "if the product @xmath138 is small , the core of the global string extends to outside the horizon @xmath93 .",
    "then the integrand of ( [ e ] ) becomes @xmath145 $ ] .",
    "since close to the horizon , the product @xmath143 tends to zero , this is finite .",
    "we have indeed confirmed numerically that this is the case .",
    "assuming that the behaviour of the metric functions @xmath69 and @xmath95 persists in the presence of all ( non - trivial ) matter fields ( which indeed our numerical analysis confirms ) , we can insert ( [ non ] ) and ( [ nol ] ) into ( [ eqf ] ) .",
    "we obtain that : @xmath146    we have construct the composite model solution by starting from the nielsen - olesen ( no ) string and increasing the parameter @xmath130 gradually from zero .",
    "our numerical analysis confirms the assumption that the radius of the no string core is smaller than that of the global string .",
    "moreover , we find that the no string always resides inside the horizon . as for the global string , we find that when the coupling constant @xmath129 is small the function @xmath128 reaches the imposed expectation value @xmath147 with a positive concavity , in particular the derivative @xmath148 is non zero and our numerical solution clearly suggests that the behaviour @xmath149 is not fulfilled .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .  5 , where we show @xmath128 of the composite defect for @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath124 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "this suggests that for small values of the product @xmath138 , the argument demonstrated above does nt hold .    increasing the value of @xmath129 we were able to produce solutions which seem to have the expected behaviour , i.e. @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "this is shown in fig .  5 for @xmath151 , @xmath124 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "of course , the occurrence of the singularity at @xmath161 renders the interpretation of the numerical results not hundred percent certain but we are rather confident that composite string defects which are regular inside the horizon exist for large enough @xmath129 .",
    "all these results are obtained for the case of @xmath162 , i.e. the two defects interact with each other only indirectly over gravity .",
    "we have also attempted to construct solutions with @xmath163 .",
    "we find that only for large enough values of the quotient @xmath164 , the solutions seem well behaved .",
    "if @xmath164 is roughly of the order of @xmath165 ( for @xmath151 , @xmath124 and @xmath153 ) , the behaviour of the functions is very similar to that in the case of @xmath162 . for @xmath164",
    "smaller than that , however , the functions @xmath128 and @xmath97 start to develop oscillations close to the cosmological horizon",
    ". the number of oscillations increases with the decrease of the quotient @xmath164 .",
    "thus , we conclude that directly interacting composite defects without the global string singularity only exist if the self - interaction of the global string is much larger than the interaction between the two defects .",
    "in this paper we have analysed both nielsen - olesen and global strings as well as the composite system of both defects in de sitter space .",
    "when the matter fields are set equal to their vacuum expectation values ( vev ) in the case of the `` pure '' nielsen - olesen string , we were able to construct analytic solutions of the einstein equations in terms of trigonometric functions .",
    "the metric tensor resembles that of so - called `` supermassive '' strings which exist in asymptotically flat space only for sufficiently high enough values of the vev of the higgs field @xcite .",
    "these were considered as being `` unphysical '' since they should have formed at energy scales high above the gut scale . since",
    "recent observations indicate that we live in a universe with positive cosmological constant , and since we find that the existence of our solutions is not restricted to values of the higgs field s vev being large enough , these solutions might well be of relevance .",
    "our numerical analysis suggests that the general behaviour of the vacuum metric persists in the presence of the matter fields .",
    "e.g. comparing the location of the cosmological horizon @xmath93 in dependence on the coupling constants for the `` pure '' nielsen - olesen string and that of the vacuum solution , @xmath105 , we find that for small @xmath86 and/or @xmath87 , @xmath93 and @xmath105 are nearly equal . for increasing @xmath86 and/or @xmath87 , the difference between the two increases .",
    "the reason for this is that the radius of the string core becomes comparable to the radius of the cosmological horizon and thus the assumption of a `` vacuum '' at the cosmological horizon is not valid any longer .    constructing the global string and the composite defect of nielsen - olesen and global string , we find that the existence of solutions without a singularity resulting from the global string itself depends crucially on the product @xmath138 which ( in our rescaled coordinates ) is inverse proportional to the radius of the global string s core .",
    "if ( for fixed @xmath130 ) @xmath129 is too small , the core of the global string extends to outside the cosmological horizon and the function @xmath166 reaches its vev with positive concavity . for large enough values of @xmath129 ,",
    "the core of the global string lies inside the horizon and our numerical results seem to indicate that a global string / composite defect without the normal singularity of the global string exists .",
    "however , note that the removal of the global string singularity which exists in asymptotically flat space can be achieved only by introducing a `` new '' singularity , the curvature singularity at the horizon .",
