    "<S> we prove that for the two - dimensional steady complete compressible euler system , with given uniform upcoming supersonic flows , the following three fundamental flow patterns ( special solutions ) in gas dynamics involving transonic shocks are all unique in the class of piecewise @xmath0 smooth functions , under appropriate conditions on the downstream subsonic flows : @xmath1 the normal transonic shocks in a straight duct with finite or infinite length , after fixing a point the shock - front passing through ; @xmath2 the oblique transonic shocks attached to an infinite wedge ; @xmath3 a flat mach configuration containing one supersonic shock , two transonic shocks , and a contact discontinuity , after fixing the point the four discontinuities intersect . </S>",
    "<S> these special solutions are constructed traditionally under the assumption that they are piecewise constant , and they have played important roles in the studies of mathematical gas dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the assumption of piecewise constant can be replaced by some more weaker assumptions on the downstream subsonic flows , which are sufficient to uniquely determine these special solutions .    </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , these are uniqueness results on solutions of free boundary problems of a quasi - linear system of elliptic - hyperbolic composite - mixed type in bounded or unbounded planar domains , without any assumptions on smallness . </S>",
    "<S> the proof relies on an elliptic system of pressure @xmath4 and the tangent of the flow angle @xmath5 obtained by decomposition of the euler system in lagrangian coordinates , and a newly developed method for the @xmath6 estimate that is independent of the free boundaries , by combining the maximum principles of elliptic equations , and careful analysis of shock polar applied on the ( maybe curved ) shock - fronts . </S>"
