    "supernovae observations @xcite first indicated that the universe s expansion has started to accelerate during recent cosmological times .",
    "this , and further observations , of the cosmological microwave background ( cmb ) or large scale structures ( lss ) , suggest that the energy density of the universe is dominated by a dark energy component , with a negative pressure , driving the acceleration",
    ". one of the substantive goals for cosmology , and for fundamental physics , is ascertaining the nature of this dark energy .",
    "maybe the most attractive option would be a cosmological constant , @xmath0 , however there are infamous fine - tuning and coincidence problems associated with explaining why @xmath0 should have today s energy scale .",
    "these problems have lead to a wealth of dynamical , scalar , dark energy (  quintessence \" ) models being proposed as alternatives to @xmath0 ( see @xcite for a good review ) . even in these cases , however , explaining why our epoch should be so crucial in triggering the acceleration still requires fine - tuning .",
    "a concurrent problem is the nature of the non - baryonic , clumping dark matter component required in the standard model to give large scale structure predictions consistent with observations .",
    "recently an alternative matter candidate , a generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) , has been proposed as a potential ` hybrid ' solution to both the dark energy and dark matter problems .",
    "the gcg can be seen to evolve in a wide range of contexts , for example from supersymmetry , tachyon cosmologies @xcite and brane cosmologies @xcite .",
    "a recent letter @xcite dealt with the implications for the matter power spectrum in the absence of cdm and effectively ruled out the gcg as a cdm substitute .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the strength of the gcg as a dark energy candidate .",
    "although there have been a number of papers discussing various aspects of gcg behavior ( @xcite-@xcite ) there has not been , as yet , a full analysis of the constraints that can be placed on such models from the wide range of complementary data sets currently available .",
    "this is necessary if such exotic matter types are to be considered as serious alternatives to the @xmath0-cdm scenario .",
    "in section [ sec2 ] we review the background evolution of the gcg and discuss the implications for supernovae ( sn1a ) observations .",
    "although such constraints are important , a wide range of proposed theories can generate the required expansion profile ( see @xcite for dark energy theories and , for example , @xcite for an alternative to dark energy ) . in order to better discriminate between theories , perturbation dependent observables",
    "must be taken into consideration . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we extend our discussion to perturbations in the chaplygin gas and discuss the implications for structure formation in the presence of an adiabatic chaplygin fluid .",
    "in section [ sec4 ] we consider the effects on radiation perturbations and the cmb spectrum . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we present the main results of the paper , likelihood analyses for a cdm+gcg+baryon universe .",
    "we include the option of a pure gcg + baryon scenario ( @xmath1 ) for completeness .",
    "we obtain a clear indication of the strength of the gcg model when compared to cdm and @xmath0 . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we summarize our findings and assess the true potential of chaplygin gases as a dark energy contender .",
    "the generalized chaplygin models can be characterized by three parameters : @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the equation of state nowadays @xmath5 and the index @xmath3 specify the equation of state evolution , p=-|w_0|_ch^0_0^. [ peq ] where @xmath6 @xmath7 is the total energy density today .",
    "the energy conservation equation , @xmath8 , admits a solution for @xmath9 specified by @xmath10 , @xmath3 and the fractional energy density today , @xmath4 , ( a)=_ch^0_0 ^ 11 + [ rhoeq ] .",
    "the equation of state then evolves as , w(a)=-|w_0| .",
    "[ weq ] at early times the gcg s equation of state tends to zero , mimicing cdm .",
    "the value of @xmath3 determines the redshift of transition between the two asymptotic behaviors ; the greater the value of @xmath3 the lower the transition redshift . at early times",
    ", the total amount of matter with @xmath11 reaches an asymptotic value    _ m , eff^0=_m^0+_ch^0 ( 1-|w_0|)^11 + [ rhoearly]where @xmath12 is the baryonic + cdm density fraction .",
    "note that the unique ability of the gcg to account for both the dark energy like behavior at late times and for ordinary dark matter at early times motivated the original studies of this particular equation of state .    in previous discussions @xmath3 has often been assigned a positive value in the range @xmath13 , in order to be consistent with various higher dimensional theories that can produce a perfect fluid stress - energy tensor satisfying the criterion in ( [ peq ] ) ( see for example @xcite ) . in our study , we extend the range of values of @xmath3 considered to @xmath14 in order to obtain a broader assessment of whether chaplygin gases could be a viable alternative to the standard model .    for @xmath3=0",
    "the background evolution of the chaplygin gas is identical to a @xmath0-cdm model with @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , as is visible in equations ( [ rhoeq ] ) and ( [ weq ] ) , when @xmath17 tends to 1 , the gcg component tends to evolve as a cosmological constant , irrespective of the value of @xmath3 .",
    "note that there is no analogous quintessence like behavior ( with @xmath18 ) , thus we are only comparing gcg to theories including @xmath0 .",
    "space with the same luminosity distance as a fiducial model @xmath0-cdm model with @xmath19 at @xmath20 ( top ) and @xmath21 ( bottom ) . for @xmath22 ( full line )",
    "the luminosity distance curve is identical to that of the fiducial model at all redshifts.,width=302 ]    the sn1a observations measure the apparent magnitude , @xmath23 , related to the luminosity distance , @xmath24 via , m(z)&=&m+5 + 25 , + d_l&=&(1+z)_0^z dzh(z ) where @xmath25 is the absolute bolumetric magnitude and @xmath26 is measured in mpc .",
    "it is easy to see that , because the background evolution ( through @xmath27 ) wholly determines luminosity distance predictions , the degeneracy between a gcg with @xmath22 and @xmath0-cdm will allow the chaplygin gas to fit the sn1a data well .",
    "indeed the degeneracy also stretches to @xmath28 when one considers luminosity distance at a specific redshift . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show chaplygin models with degenerate luminosity distances with a fiducial @xmath0-cdm model with @xmath29=0.7 , at @xmath20 and 1.0 .",
    "this degeneracy , however , implies that the sn1a observations can not be a strong discriminant between the gcg and @xmath0 ; we must look to alternative , perturbation - dependent observations to test the validity of the gcg models .",
    "we treat the chaplygin gas as a perfect fluid made up of effectively massless particles interacting with the rest of matter purely through gravity .",
    "we assume purely adiabatic contributions to the perturbations so that the speed of sound for the fluid is c_s^2=p = = -w[cs2]and the time variation of @xmath30 is = -3h(1+w)(c_s^2-w)=3hw(1+w)(+1 ) where derivatives are with respect to conformal time ( d / d@xmath31 ) , and @xmath32 .",

    "the fluid is highly non - relativistic and therefore we assume the shear perturbation @xmath38 .    at early times ,",
    "when the chaplygin gas has @xmath39 , the gcg perturbations evolve like those of ordinary dust with @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . in the radiation era @xmath42 , while @xmath43 in the early gcg dominated era . at later times , when the gcg s equation of state starts to decrease , the perturbations stray drastically from this dust - like evolution",

    "an earlier matter - radiation equality also decreases the depth of the potential well at last scattering , which combined with the reduction in radiation driving , increases the height of the third peak in comparison to the first and second ones .",
    "as one increases @xmath10 one decreases @xmath91 , lowering @xmath85 , and increasing the height of the first peak .",

    "the multitudinous effects that the gcg has on the cmb spectrum make comparison with cmb observations a strong test for the gcg models as will be seen below .",
    "in order now to assess the viability of a gcg+cdm+baryon universe , we turn to evaluate the probability ( the posterior ) of these models given some current observations , namely sn1a , cmb and lss probed through galaxy survey .",
    "to study the posterior distribution , we use the baye s theorem and rewrite it as the product of the likelihood and the prior ( we assume the evidence is constant and thus ignore it ) . to probe this posterior ,",
    "we consequently compute both the likelihood and the prior at various positions in the chosen restricted parameter space .",
    "this sampling is conducted via the construction of a monte carlo markov chain through the metropolis - hasting algorithm . once converged , this chain provides us with a collection of independant samples from the posterior ( see @xcite for an introduction to this technique in this context and @xcite for general guidance ) .",
    "our code uses some likelihood computation elements from the code described in @xcite , and relies on a version of the camb code @xcite extended to include a chaplygin gas component in order to calculate cmb power spectra and matter power spectra . as input data , we considered the apparent magnitudes of 51 supernovae @xcite , cmb data sets from cobe @xcite , maxima @xcite , boomerang @xcite , and vsa @xcite and large scale structure data from 2df @xcite .",
    "we consider only flat models , @xmath92 with scale invariant initial power spectrum , @xmath93 .",
    "we use stringent ( gaussian ) priors on @xmath94 using the hst key project results @xmath95 @xcite and on @xmath96 using bbn constraints @xcite .",
    "we normalize the matter power spectrum using @xmath97 , the initial power spectrum normalization , and following @xcite , we use @xmath98 and @xmath99 to parameterize redshift - space distortions and ( linear ) bias respectively . the power spectrum is then related to the transfer function @xmath100 ( computed with camb ) by p(k)=a_s(1 + 23+^25)b^2_1t(k)^2 .",
    "[ matpow ] in order to alleviate the natural degeneracy between @xmath101 and @xmath99 ( as far as lss constraints are concerned ) , we use the 2df results @xcite to impose strong ( gaussian ) priors on @xmath98 and @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath102 .    throughout this analysis , we ensured the chains convergence by generating and comparing several of them ( typically containing @xmath103 elements ) and by checking the so - called `` parameter mixing '' amid them .",
    "after several trials , we choose the proposal density for each parameter to be a gaussian whose width is close to the final one and whose center is the last chain values .",
    "this allows a full exploration of the parameter space . to pick - up the next chain element",
    ", we allow only 1 to 3 directions ( this number is randomly chosen ) to vary .",
    "this gives us an acceptance rate around 25% , a good target value for efficiency s sake @xcite .",
    "the first 4000 elements of the chain , prior to its convergence , are thrown away and no extra thinning is applied @xcite",
    ".    once converged , the chains provide a fair sampling of the full posterior distribution so that we can deduce easily from it all the quantities of interest , the ( joint ) marginalized distribution of any parameter(s ) .    as stated above , we are interested in finding the compatibility of a chaplygin gas + cdm + baryon universe with current data .",
    "for this we vary only 8 parameters @xmath104 and impose the priors stated above .",
    "we allow a free proposal distribution for @xmath105 , including @xmath106 consistent with a unified matter universe purely containing a gcg and baryons .",
    "this allows the full breadth of gcg roles ( as both a dark matter and dark energy candidate ) to be tested . following section [ sec3 ] s discussion , we restrict ourselves to @xmath107 and @xmath108 . in figure [ fig7 ]",
    "we plot the marginalized joint distribution of the @xmath3 , @xmath10 parameters ( which is in this case just the joint number density of those parameters ) , as well as the 68% and 95% confidence contours , considering separately sn1a , lss , cmb data sets , and also jointly cmb and lss .",
    "note that for visual purposes only the displayed surface has been build by oversampling our samples using cubic interpolation .",
    "this does not affect the quantitative interpretation since the distributions turn out to be smooth .",
    "the interpretation of the contours is nicely consistent with the theoretical prospects discussed above .",
    "first , the sn1a observations ( top - left panel ) offer very light constraints on the gcg parameters , since they are sensitive only to the background evolution .",
    "any @xmath3 value appear viable , extending thus the obvious degeneracy between @xmath0-cdm model and gcg models with @xmath22 discussed in section [ sec2 ] ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "as soon as density perturbations are considered , the constraints tighten drastically . for both lss and cmb ,",
    "the isocontours are roughly centered on the @xmath22 , @xmath109 model , that corresponds to the gcg acting like a @xmath0 term .",
    "this fact is emphasized in the joint cmb + lss analysis .",
    "note that in the limit that @xmath110 tends to @xmath111 ( we however impose @xmath112 ) , the gcg component tends to behave like a @xmath0 term , irrespective of the precise value of @xmath3 , thus leading to the observed degeneracy in the @xmath113 direction .",
    "the other varied parameters , @xmath114 , @xmath87 and @xmath115 , as well as the flatness imposed @xmath116 , exhibit ( joint ) distributions similar to those found in typical @xmath0-cdm model studies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this leads us to the the main conclusion of this study : the current data tends to favor ordinary @xmath0 theory . when marginalized over all other parameters , we indeed find , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , both respectively at the 68% and 95% confidence level .",
    "we have investigated the effect of a chaplygin gas matter component in the universe s ingredients , to see if such a component is consistent with observations and whether it is a feasible alternative to cdm and @xmath0 .    through inherent degeneracies with @xmath0 in the background evolution ,",
    "the chaplygin gas models have a good fit with sn1a data .",
    "these degeneracies are not present , however , in the perturbation evolution . in particular the growth / suppression of both gcg and cdm density perturbations proves distinctive when comparing against large scale structure observations ; this statement is valid , of course , for all cases ( for all @xmath3 ) except , naturally , @xmath119 which is identical to @xmath0 , and has no perturbations .",
    "the gcg also introduces a number of distinguishing differences from the @xmath0-cdm cmb spectrum through altering the potential at last scattering , the isw signature , the equality scale , and the angular diameter distance to last scattering .",
    "combined , these differences provide a strong test for the gcg scenario .",
    "we performed likelihood analyses using sn1a , cmb and lss datasets and found that the current data strongly prefers a @xmath0-like dark energy component , with @xmath120 and @xmath121 at the 68% level and with cdm as the preferred pressureless matter component .",
    "note that , in comparison , the unified dark matter model , with @xmath122 , is highly disfavored by the data .",
    "this result is consistent , but considerably tightens , previous constraints from supernovae , cmb peak position and matter power spectrum shape parameter analyses ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "our constraints can be recast in terms of the ` statefinder ' parameters of @xcite , @xmath123 and @xmath124 at the 68% level , thus greatly reducing the ability of a chaplygin gas to explain the ` cosmic conundrum ' problem as proposed in @xcite .",
    "our analysis assumed adiabatic perturbations for the chaplygin gas ; it remains to be seen how enriching this model by considering non - adiabatic perturbations , as mentioned in a paper presented after the initial posting of this work @xcite , might alter the analysis .",
    "on the basis of current observations however , chaplygin gases , with adiabatic perturbations at least , do not seem to provide a favored alternative to scenarios involving cdm and a cosmological constant .",
