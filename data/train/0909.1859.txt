    "this paper deals with simplices with equiareal faces in the euclidean 3-space . a simplex is called a _ simplex with equiareal faces _ if all its faces have the same area and is called _ degenerate _ if all its vertices lie on a single plane .",
    "our primary interest is the following    * problem 1 . *",
    "_ prove that all faces of any non - degenerate simplex with equiareal faces in the euclidean 3-space are congruent to each other .",
    "_    problem 1 already appeared in several contexts .",
    "we mention here some of those appearances though we can not say that our knowledge is complete .    in the 1960s professor",
    "hans vogler in vienna used problem 1 to convince his students how powerful the synthetic geometry is . as far as we know , his desciptive - geometrical solution was never published .    independently , in the 1970 s and 1980 s the following form of problem 1 was used to prevent ` undesirable applicants ' from joining the moscow state university : ` the faces of a triangular pyramid have the same area .",
    "show that they are congruent . '",
    "an elementary solution to the latter problem given in @xcite shows that indeed the problem is far from being trivial .    in @xcite , among other results",
    "p. mcmullen has proved that _ a non - degenerate simplex is a simplex with equiareal faces if an only if its opposite pairs of edges have the same lengths .",
    "_ it is easy to see that this statement is equivalent to problem 1 .",
    "mcmullen s proof is very short and natural , but it is not elementary since it rests on minkowski s theorem on uniqueness and existence of a  closed convex polyhedron with given directions and areas of faces ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; the direction of a  face is determined by the outward unit normal to the face ) .    in 2007 professor robert",
    "connelly in cornell university has brought our attention to the fact that it is reasonable to study degenerate simplices with equiareal faces .",
    "he argued that when we fix three vertices , say @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , and move arbitrarily the fourth vertex , say @xmath3 , nothing special happens when @xmath3 occurs in the plane  @xmath4 : the degenerate simplex is obtained as a limit of non - degenerate ones ; the notions of the vertex , edge , and face are clear for it ; the notion of the face area is well defined ; from combinatorial point of view there is no difference between degenerate and non - degenerate simplices . besides",
    ", the degenerate polyhedra play very important role in ` advanced ' study of convex polytopes , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "also professor robert connelly has brought our attention to the fact that , in contrast with problem 1 , there are degenerate simplices with non - congruent equiareal faces .",
    "in fact , every parallelogram equipped with its diagonals may be treated as a degenerate simplex with equiareal faces as well as every four points on a line may be treated as a vertex - set of a degenerate simplex with equiareal faces ( with all areas equal zero ) .",
    "the problem is whether there are some other degenerate simplices with equiareal faces .    in section  [ section2 ]",
    "we give the shortest available for us elementary solution to problem  1 .",
    "as far as we know , its main idea should be attributed to professor hans vogler who is now at the university of innsbruck . in section  [ section3 ]",
    "we use heron s formula to study all simplices with equiareal faces , both degenerate and non - degenerate .",
    "note that in order to solve problem 1 it is sufficient to solve the following problem  2 which is of independent interest .",
    "* problem  2 . *",
    "_ let @xmath5 be a non - degenerate simplex , let @xmath6 , and let @xmath7 , where @xmath8 stands for the area of the triangle @xmath9 .",
    "prove that @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 stands for the length of the straight line segment  @xmath13 _ ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "* solution * to problem 2 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the plane which is parallel to the line  @xmath15 and contains the line  @xmath16 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "we are going to study the orthogonal projection of the simplex @xmath5 into the plane @xmath14 .",
    "denote by  @xmath17 the image of a point @xmath18 under that projection and denote by  @xmath19 the foot of the perpendicular to the line  @xmath15 emanated from the point  @xmath18 .",
    "+ -65 mm    since  @xmath15 is parallel to  @xmath14 we have  @xmath20 . since the triangles  @xmath21 and  @xmath22 have equal areas and the common side  @xmath15",
    "we conclude that  @xmath23 . applying pythagoras theorem to the right - angled triangles  @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "we get  @xmath26 . in terms of the quadrilateral @xmath27",
    "this means that the vertices  @xmath3 and  @xmath2 lie at the same distance from the diagonal  @xmath28 .",
    "note also that the triangles @xmath29 and @xmath30 have the same area and the points  @xmath3 and  @xmath2 lie on the different sides of the line passing through the points  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , if they lie on the same side , the line through the points  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 must be parallel to the line through the points  @xmath3 and  @xmath2 and , thus , the points  @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and  @xmath3 should be coplanar .",
    "a contradiction .",
    "similar arguments applied to the triangles  @xmath33 and  @xmath34 show that the vertices  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 of the quadrilateral  @xmath27 lie at the same distance from the line through the points  @xmath3 and  @xmath2 and , moreover , lie on the different sides of that line .",
    "hence , the quadrilateral  @xmath27 is convex .    recall that if a convex planar quadrilateral is such that every two opposite vertices lie at the same distance from the diagonal that joins the rest two vertices then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram .",
    "this implies that the quadrilateral  @xmath27 is a parallelogram and , thus , that @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "applying pythagoras theorem to the right - angled triangles @xmath37 and @xmath38 and taking into account that @xmath39 we get @xmath40 .    similar arguments applied to the triangles @xmath41 and @xmath42 show that @xmath11 .",
    "from section [ section1 ] we know the following three types of equiareal non - degenerate and degenerate simplices in the euclidean 3-space :              * solution * to problem 3 .",
    "let @xmath43 be a simplex with equiareal faces .",
    "let the first face ( i ) of @xmath43 has edges of the lengths @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ; the second face ( ii ) has edges of the lengths @xmath44 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ; the third face ( iii )  @xmath45 , @xmath49 , and @xmath48 ; and the forth face ( iv )  @xmath46 , @xmath49 , and @xmath47 .",
    "( equivalently , we can say that side @xmath49 is opposite to @xmath44 ; side @xmath47  to @xmath45 ; and @xmath48  to @xmath46 ) .",
    "let @xmath50 be common area of the faces of @xmath43 .",
    "so , we arrive at the most computationally difficult , but still straightforward point of the solution : substitute @xmath58 in ( 6 ) by the right - hand side of ( 5 ) . after simplifications and multiple usage of the formula @xmath61 we get @xmath63s^4.\\ ] ]    we see that @xmath64 is a root of ( 7 ) which corresponds to simplices of type 3 . in order to find the other roots ,",
    "cancel @xmath65 in ( 7 ) , rearrange terms and use the formula @xmath61 again to arrive at @xmath66=0.\\ ] ] note that the bi - quadratic expression in the brackets has two roots : @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "note also that we can obtain similar equations for @xmath47 and @xmath48 just by permuting three pairs of symbols @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 . as a result",
    "we find 8 solutions for @xmath72 and @xmath48 that are accumulated as rows in the following table :        solutions 2 , 3 , and 5 correspond to simplices of type 2 .",
    "for example , a simplex @xmath43 , corresponding to solution 2 , is degenerated into a parallelogram with the side lengths @xmath44 and @xmath45 and the diagonals @xmath46 and @xmath73 ( recall that in any parallelogram the sum of the squared lengths of all sides equals the sum of the squared lengths of the both diagonals ) .",
    "solutions 4 , 6 , and 7 correspond to simplices of type 2 again , but the face ( i ) , with edge lengths @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , must be a right - angled triangle this time .",
    "for example , consider solution 4 .",
    "we have @xmath74 using the formula ( 2 ) we get @xmath75 .",
    "now we use the formula ( 1 ) and , after some simplifications , we get @xmath76 . without loss of generality , we may assume that @xmath77 .",
    "this yields @xmath78 and , thus , the face ( i ) is a right - angled triangle .",
    "moreover , now the formula ( 8) implies that @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "hence , the simplex @xmath43 , corresponding to solution 4 , is degenerated to a parallelogram with the side lengths @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 and the diagonals of the lengths @xmath46 and @xmath83 .",
    "hence , the simplex @xmath43 is of type 2 .",
    "solutions 6 and 7 are treated similarly .",
    "solution 8 does not correspond to any simplex in the euclidean 3-space ( neither degenerated nor non - degenerated ) . in fact",
    ", we have @xmath84 using the formula ( 2 ) we get @xmath75 .",
    "now we use formula ( 1 ) and , after some simplifications , we get @xmath76 or @xmath85 the geometric meaning of the formula ( 10 ) is that either @xmath45 or @xmath46 is the hypotenuse of the right - angled triangle ( i ) with the sides @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . similarly we can substitute ( 9 ) into formulas ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . proceeding as above we get @xmath86 the geometric meaning of the formula ( 11 ) is that either @xmath46 or @xmath44 is the hypotenuse of the right - angled triangle ( i ) with the sides @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , the formula ( 12 ) implies that either @xmath45 or @xmath44 is the hypotenuse of the right - angled triangle ( i ) with the sides @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "but the triangle ( i ) has only one hypotenuse !",
    "hence the equations ( 10)(12 ) can not hold true simultaneously .",
    "this means that solution 8 does not correspond to any simplex .",
