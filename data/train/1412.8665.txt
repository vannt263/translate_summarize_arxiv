    "second , a spherical blr is taken into account to get new formulae .",
    "the geometrical structure is presented in fig . 1 for the shell blr .",
    "first , the viewing angle to the jet axis is assumed to be @xmath16 . as the disturbances from the central engine reach point e ( see fig .",

    ", there is a zero - lag , and we have @xmath18 .",

    "if the disturbances reach point e and the line photons reach f , the lines will lag the jet emission ( see fig .",
    "we have @xmath25 , and then @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the time lag of lines relative to the jet emission . if the disturbances reach point e and the line photons reach g , the lines will lead the jet emission ( see fig .",
