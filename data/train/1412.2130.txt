    "minimal surfaces have a long and interesting history .",
    "the name _ minimal _ corresponds to the property that each point of such a surface has a neighborhood that minimizes the area among all surfaces with the same boundary .",
    "it turns out that this is equivalent to the vanishing of the mean curvature of the surface .",
    "the first nontrivial minimal surfaces discovered were the catenoid and the helicoid .",
    "after that , for many years no new minimal surfaces were found . from the investigations of weierstrass and enneper in the 19th century we know that any minimal surface can be found at least locally from a complex minimal curve , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "nowadays the minimal surfaces are important in many areas such as architecture , material science , aviation , biology .",
    "because of their minimizing property , these surfaces can be also interesting in cad research .",
    "note that , for the moment , in this area it is more important to consider polynomial minimal surfaces .",
    "the problem is that such surfaces are probably not very numerous in small degrees . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that up to homothety and position in the space , the classical enneper surface is the unique polynomial minimal surface of degree 3 .    in @xcite and",
    "@xcite some families of polynomial minimal surfaces of degrees 6 and 5 are introduced . in @xcite",
    "we showed a relation among these families . to do this",
    ", we can not use the classical method used in @xcite for degree 3 .",
    "we need a new method developed thanks to a new approach to minimal surfaces , proposed by ganchev @xcite .    here",
    "we explain with examples how this method works .",
    "namely , in section 4 we prove that the above mentioned families of polynomial surfaces of degree 6 from @xcite contain many congruent surfaces and that all the surfaces in these families coincide up to homothety and position in space with the classical enneper surface .",
    "we also show how one can look for an explicit relation between congruent minimal surfaces .",
    "note that the construction of these examples in @xcite is based on a theorem for the coefficients of a minimal polynomial surface of degree six , but two of the equations in this theorem as formulated in @xcite are not exact . in section 3 ,",
    "we give the correct version of the theorem .",
    "actually , the construction of the above mentioned examples is not affected by the wrong equations .",
    "unfortunately in @xcite another general family is obtained by using one of the wrong equations and the surfaces in it are not minimal .",
    "so in section 5 we construct a new large family of polynomial minimal surfaces of degree 6 and we prove some relations between its surfaces .",
    "let @xmath0 be a regular surface defined by the parametric equation @xmath1 denote the derivatives of the vector function @xmath2 by @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the unit normal to the surface is defined by @xmath8 then the coefficients of the first and the second fundamental form are given resp .",
    "by @xmath9 and @xmath10    recall that the parameters of the surface are called isothermal , if @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the gauss curvature @xmath13 and the mean curvature @xmath14 of a surface @xmath0 are defined by @xmath15 the surface @xmath0 is called _ minimal _ if its mean curvature vanishes identically . in this case",
    "the gauss curvature is negative .",
    "the _ normal curvature _ @xmath16 of a minimal surface @xmath0 is defined to be the function @xmath17 , see @xcite .",
    "this is exactly the positive principal curvature of @xmath0 .",
    "let us now consider a minimal surface defined in isothermal parameters .",
    "then it can be considered as a real part of a complex curve .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath18 and @xmath19 be two holomorphic functions .",
    "define the weierstrass complex curve @xmath20 by @xmath21 then @xmath22 is a minimal curve , i.e. @xmath23 , and its real and imaginary parts @xmath24 and @xmath25 define two minimal surfaces in isothermal parametrizations .",
    "we say that these two minimal surfaces are _",
    "conjugate_. moreover , every minimal surface can be obtained at least locally as the real part of a weierstrass minimal curve .",
    "taking @xmath26 , @xmath27 we obtain a weierstrass minimal curve whose real part is the catenoid @xmath28 and the imaginary part is the helicoid @xmath29    given two conjugate minimal surfaces @xmath24 and @xmath25 we can define the associated family @xmath30 then for any real number @xmath31 the surface @xmath32 is also minimal and has the same first fundamental form as @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the coefficients of the first fundamental form of the associated family defined in the above way via the weierstrass formula with functions @xmath18 , @xmath19 are given by @xmath33 and the normal curvature is @xmath34 see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  22.33 ) .",
    "a new approach to minimal surfaces was proposed by ganchev in @xcite .",
    "he introduced special principal parameters and called them _",
    "canonical principal parameters_. the surface being parametrized with them , the coefficients of its fundamental forms are given by @xmath35 moreover , the surface in canonical principal parametrization is the real part of a weierstrass minimal curve generated by some functions @xmath18 , @xmath19 with @xmath36 , i.e. it is the real part of the special weierstrass curve @xmath37    the following theorem is of great importance :    [ t:2.1 ] @xcite if a surface is parametrized with canonical principal parameters , then its normal curvature satisfies the differential equation @xmath38 conversely , for any solution @xmath39 of this equation ( with @xmath40 ) , there exists a * unique * ( up to position in space ) minimal surface with normal curvature @xmath39 , @xmath41 being canonical principal parameters .",
    "moreover , the canonical principal parameters @xmath41 are determined uniquely up to the following transformations @xmath42    we will also use the following results :    [ t:2.2 ] @xcite let the minimal surface @xmath0 be defined by the real part of the weierstrass minimal curve ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) . any solution of the differential equation @xmath43 defines a transformation of the isothermal parameters of @xmath0 to canonical principal parameters . moreover the function @xmath44 that defines @xmath0 via the ganchev formula is given by @xmath45 .",
    "[ t:2.5 ] @xcite let the holomorphic function @xmath46 generate a minimal surface in canonical principal parameters , i.e. via the ganchev formula .",
    "then , for an arbitrary complex number @xmath47 , and for an arbitrary real number @xmath48 , any of the functions @xmath49 generates the same surface in canonical principal parameters ( up to position in space ) .",
    "conversely , any function that generates this surface ( up to position in space ) in canonical principal parameters has the above form .",
    "more precisely , from the proof of the last theorem we see that , up to a translation , the surface generated by the function ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) is obtained from the surface generated by @xmath19 after a rotation with the matrix @xmath50 , where    @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in particular , if @xmath53 this is a rotation by the angle @xmath48 about the third axis .",
    "[ t:2.6 ] @xcite for arbitrary nonzero complex numbers @xmath54 , @xmath55 , the minimal surfaces generated via the weierstrass formula by the pairs of functions @xmath56 coincide up to position in space and homothety .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that if a parametric minimal surface of degree 6 is presented in isothermal parameters , then it has the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 are coefficient vectors .",
    "then the authors of @xcite formulate and give a sketch of the proof of a theorem about the relation between these coefficients so that the surface be minimal . actually , two of the equations in this theorem are not exact .",
    "namely , the statement must look as follows    [ t:3.1 . ]",
    "the harmonic polynomial surface ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) is a minimal surface if and only if its coefficient vectors satisfy the following system of equations @xmath59    the proof is based on the vanishing of the coefficients of @xmath60 in the power expansion of the isothermal condition @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the differences with the theorem as formulated in @xcite are in the seventh and the twelfth equations .",
    "using the first four equations of the system ( [ eq:3.2 ] ) , we can suppose that the coefficient vectors are @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , see @xcite .",
    "if we suppose @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , we obtain a family of minimal surfaces , depending on four shape parameters @xmath77 .",
    "two special cases are studied in @xcite .",

    "the figures bellow represent the surfaces @xmath86(u , v)$ ] and @xmath87(u , v)$ ] for @xmath88 $ ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     it turns out that the conjugate surfaces in theorem [ t:4.1 . ]",
    "actually coincide .",
    "we will see that moreover they coincide with any surface of their associated family .",
    "namely , we have    [ t:4.2 . ] for any real number  @xmath31  the surface @xmath89(u , v)={\\boldsymbol r_1}[a_1,i_1]\\cos t+{\\boldsymbol r_2}[-a_1,i_1](u , v)\\sin t\\ ] ] coincides up to position in space with that defined by  @xmath84(u , v)=\\boldsymbol { assoc}_0[a_1,i_1](u , v)$ ] .    _ proof .",
    "_ suppose for example that @xmath90 .",
    "we will change the parameters of @xmath32 to canonical principal ones .",
    "first we need the functions that generate @xmath91(u , v)$ ] via the weierstrass formula .",
    "they can be found from the well known relations @xmath92 where @xmath93 see e.g. @xcite , lemma 22.31 . in our case",
    "these equalities give @xmath94 with these functions a solution of ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) is @xmath95 so we change @xmath96 in @xmath97 by @xmath98 and we obtain that the function @xmath99 generates @xmath32 in canonical principal parameters .",
    "then , using ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) we obtain the normal curvature in canonical principal parameters to be ( recall that @xmath31 is real ) @xmath100 since this number does not depend on @xmath31 , theorem [ t:2.1 ] implies that any surface @xmath32 is congruent with every other surface in the associated family and in particular to @xmath101 .    in the same way we can prove    [ t:4.3 .",
    "] _ the minimal surfaces defined by the charts @xmath84(u , v)$ ] , @xmath102(u , v)$ ] , @xmath103(u , v)$ ] , @xmath104(u , v)$ ] are congruent .",

    "if we notice that the generating functions @xmath109 and @xmath110 satisfy @xmath111 indeed , the last equality and theorem [ t:2.5 ] imply the conclusion of theorem [ t:4.2 . ] .",
    "moreover in view of ( [ eq:4.2 ] ) and theorem [ t:2.5 ] we can say that up to a translation @xmath32 is obtained from @xmath101 with a rotation of angle @xmath112 around the third axis . to realize this rotation we first obtain the weierstrass minimal curves of @xmath84(u , v)$ ] and @xmath91(u , v)$ ] . by ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) , ( [ eq:4.1 ] ) , and the definitions of @xmath84(u , v)$ ] and @xmath85(u , v)$ ] , these curves are @xmath113 @xmath114 respectively .",
    "so we see that the transformation from the chart ( [ eq:4.3 ] ) to the chart ( [ eq:4.4 ] ) can be made without any translation , but we have to make the change of the parameters @xmath115 in ( [ eq:4.3 ] ) .",
    "so we obtain the following parametrization of the minimal curve defined by ( [ eq:4.3 ] ) : @xmath116 now the rotation of the last chart with angle @xmath112 around the third axis gives ( [ eq:4.4 ] ) .",
    "the real form of the above change of parameters is @xmath117 as a result we obtain    [ t:4.5 . ] _ for any real number @xmath31 the chart @xmath91(u , v)$ ] is obtained from @xmath84(u , v)$ ] with a change of the parameters ( [ eq:4.5 ] ) and then a rotation with angle @xmath112 aroud the third axis .",

    "] says that all the surfaces in the families @xmath84(u , v)$ ] and @xmath121(u , v)$ ] coincide up to position in space and homothety .",
    "at the end of this section we note that , for any values of the shape parameters , the function @xmath122 that generates the considered surfaces has the form @xmath123 with a complex constant @xmath124 , just like the surfaces homothetic to the enneper surface .",
    "this looks strange for a polynomial surface of degree 6 .",

    "we remark that they are all homothetic to the enneper surface . if for example @xmath90 , to realize the correspondence it suffices to make the change of the parameters @xmath127",
    "in this section we suppose that @xmath128 .",
    "then , with the assumptions from the end of section 3 , the system ( [ eq:3.2 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath129 suppose in addition that the vectors @xmath130 and @xmath131 lie in @xmath132",

    "so we assume that @xmath138 .",
    "then , from ( [ eq:5.2 ] ) we obtain @xmath139 , @xmath140 so , as in section 4 , we obtain a family of minimal surfaces depending on the four shape parameters @xmath141 : @xmath142(u , v)=\\big ( x(u , v),y(u , v),z(u , v)\\big)\\ ] ] where @xmath143    now we shall consider the surfaces defined by @xmath144={\\boldsymbol s}[a_1,0,c_3,0](u , v)\\ ] ] and @xmath145={\\boldsymbol s}[0,a_2,0,d_3](u , v)\\ ] ] using ( [ eq:4.8 ] ) we obtain the functions that generate these surfaces via the weierstrass formula .",
    "they are respectively @xmath146 @xmath147 from ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) and ( [ eq:5.3 ] ) we find the weierstrass minimal curve , whose real part is @xmath148 $ ] : @xmath149 then it is easy to check that the imaginary part of @xmath150 is @xmath151 $ ] .",
    "hence we have      concerning the pairs ( [ eq:5.3 ] ) and ( [ eq:5.4 ] ) , we take the following solutions of the system ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) for the transition to canonical principal parameters : @xmath154 respectively . hence the functions @xmath155 generate the surfaces in canonial principal parameters .",
    "hence it is clear that the normal curvatures of @xmath152(u , v)$ ] and @xmath153(u , v)$ ] coincide , and so we have        to find the exact relation between the conjugate charts @xmath152(u , v)$ ] and @xmath153(u , v)$ ] , we can use the same arguments as in section 4 .",

    "for example , another possibility is to make the following change of the parameters in @xmath152(u , v)$ ] : @xmath161 and to rotate about the third axis with an angle @xmath48 , such that @xmath162 an analogous remark holds for the surfaces in section 4 .",
    "now consider the general chart @xmath163(u , v)$ ] . using ( [ eq:4.8 ] ) we see that it is generated via the weierstrass formula with the functions @xmath164 a corresponding solution of the differential equation ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) is @xmath165 which gives the following generating function in canonical principal parameters : @xmath166 and the following normal curvature in these parameters : @xmath167 hence it follows that every two surfaces for which @xmath168 is one and the same number are congruent . in particular , this implies theorem [ t:5.2 . ] .",
    "[ t:5.4 . ] _ for any shape parameters , the surface defined by @xmath163(u , v)$ ] coincides with the surface generated via the weierstrass formula by the functions @xmath169 up to position in space and homothety . _        at the end of this article we note that the parametric minimal surfaces of degree six in section 4 are completely different from those in section 5 .",
    "this follows from their normal curvatures and theorem [ t:2.1 ] , or from the functions that generate these surfaces in canonical principal parameters and theorem [ t:2.5 ] .",
    "indeed , any of the surfaces in section 4 is generated in canonical principal parameters by a function of the form @xmath172 , whereas any surface defined by a chart @xmath163(u , v)$ ] is generated by a function of the form @xmath173 ."
