    "games such as chess , warfare and politics have been played throughout history .",
    "whenever individuals meet who have conflicting desires , and priorities , then games are likely to be played .",
    "analysis and understanding of games has existed for long times but the emergence of game theory as a formal study of games is widely believed to have taken place when neumann and morgenstern @xcite published their pioneering book `` the theory of games and economic behaviour '' in 1944 .",
    "game theory @xcite  is now an established discipline of mathematics that is a vast subject having a rich history and content . roughly speaking , game theory is the analysis of the actions made by rational players when these actions are strategically interdependent .",
    "the 1970s saw game theory being successfully applied to problems of evolutionary biology and a new branch of game theory , recognized as evolutionary game theory @xcite , came into existence .",
    "the concept of utility from economics was given an interpretation in terms of darwinian fitness .",
    "originally , evolutionary game theory considered animal conflicts occurring in macro - world . in recent years , research in biology @xcite suggested that nature also plays classical games at micro - level .",
    "bacterial infections by viruses are classical game - like situations where nature prefers dominant strategies .    in game theory",
    "@xcite one finds many examples where multiple nash equilibria ( ne ) @xcite emerge as solutions of a game .",
    "to select one ( or possibly more ) out of these requires some refinement of the equilibrium concept @xcite .",
    "a refinement is a rule / criterion that describes the criterion to prefer one ( in some cases more than one ) equilibrium out of many .",
    "numerous refinements are found in game theory , for example , perfect equilibrium ( used for extensive- and normal - form games ) , sequential equilibrium ( a fundamental non - cooperative solution concept for extensive - form games ) , and correlated equilibrium ( used for modelling communication among players ) .    during recent years",
    "quantum game theory @xcite has emerged as a new research field within quantum information and computation @xcite .",
    "a significant portion of research in quantum games deals with the question asking how quantization of a game affects / changes the existence / location of a ne .",
    "this question has been addressed in a number of publications @xcite in this area and now it seems that it is generally agreed that quantization of a game indeed affects / changes the existence / location of a ne .    in this chapter",
    "we argue that , like asking how quantization of a game affects / changes the existence / location of a ne , an equally important question for quantum games is to ask how quantization of a game can affect a refinement of the ne concept .",
    "we notice that a particular refinement of the ne , known as an evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess ) , is central to evolutionary game theory . while focussing on a this refinement , we motivate those quantum games in which a ne persists in both of its classical and quantum versions while its property of being an ess survives in either classical or its quantum version , but not in the both .",
    "we argue that , the quantum games offering such situations , along with their quantization procedures , can justifiably be said to extend the boundary of investigations in quantum games from existence / location of ne to existence / location of one ( or more ) of its refinements .",
    "the roots of evolutionary game theory @xcite can be traced to the puzzle of the approximate equality of the sex ratio in mammals . in 1930",
    "fisher ( @xcite ) noticed that if individual fitness is defined in terms of the expected number of grandchildren , then it becomes dependent on how males and females are distributed in a population .",
    "fisher showed that the evolutionary dynamics then leads to the sex ratio becoming fixed at equal numbers of males and females . although fisher s argument can be recast in game - theoretic language but originally it was not presented in those terms .",
    "perhaps it was due to the fact that until that time modern game theory had not yet emerged as a formal study of games .",
    "modern game theory was used , for the first time , to understand evolution when in 1972 maynard smith and g. r. price introduced the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess ) @xcite .",
    "presently , this concept is widely believed to be the cornerstone of evolutionary game theory @xcite and has been found quite useful to explain and understand animal behavior .    traditionally , game theory had concerned analyzing interactions among hyperrational players and the idea that it can be applied to animals seemed strange at the time .",
    "the ess concept made three important changes in the traditional meaning of the concepts of a ) strategy , b ) equilibrium , and c ) players interactions .",
    "\\a ) _ strategy _ : in traditional game theory , players have strategy set from which they choose their strategies . in biology ,",
    "animals belonging to a species have strategy sets that are genotypic variants that may be mutated , of which individuals inherit one or another variant , which they then play in their strategic interactions . a mixed strategy in game theory",
    "means a convex linear combination ( with real and normalized coefficients ) of pure strategies .",
    "because genotypic variants are taken as pure strategies , the evolutionary game theory interprets a mixed strategy in terms of proportion of the population that is playing that strategy .",
    "\\b ) _ equilibrium _ : an ess represents an equilibrium and it is a strategy having the property that if a whole population plays it , it can not be invaded under the influence of natural selection , by a small group of players playing mutant strategies . because strategies of evolutionary games are genotypes the ess definition takes the following form : if adapted by a whole population an ess is a genotype that can not be invaded by another genotype when it appears in a small fraction of the total population .",
    "\\c ) _ player interactions _ : the ess concept is about repeated and random pairing of players who play strategies based on their genome and _ not _ on the previous history of play .",
    "this approach was new to the usual approach of one - shot and repeated games of classical game theory .",
    "consider a large population @xcite in which members are matched repeatedly and randomly in pairs to play a bi - matrix game .",
    "the players are anonymous , that is , any pair of players plays the same symmetric bi - matrix game .",
    "the symmetry of a bi - matrix game means that for a strategy set @xmath0 alice s payoff when she plays @xmath1 and bob plays @xmath2 is the same as bob s payoff when he plays @xmath3 and alice plays @xmath4 .",
    "hence , a player s payoff is defined by his / her strategy and _ not _ by his / her identity and an exchange of strategies by the two players also exchanges their respective payoffs .",
    "a symmetric bi - matrix game is represented by an expression @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the first player s payoff matrix and @xmath7 , being its transpose , is the second players payoff matrix . in a symmetric pair - wise contest",
    "one can write @xmath8 as being the payoff to a @xmath9-player against a @xmath10-player .    to be precise @xcite a strategy @xmath9 is said to be an ess if :    \\a ) for each mutant strategy @xmath10 there exists a positive _ invasion barrier _ _ .",
    "_    \\b ) if the population share of individuals playing the mutant strategy @xmath10 falls below the invasion barrier , then @xmath9 earns a higher expected payoff than @xmath10 .    mathematically speaking",
    "@xcite @xmath9 is an ess when for each strategy @xmath11 the inequality @xmath12>p[y,(1-\\epsilon)x+\\epsilon y ] \\label{essdefineq}\\ ] ] holds for all sufficiently small @xmath13 . in ( [ essdefineq ] )",
    "the expression on the left - hand side is payoff to the strategy @xmath9 when played against the mixed strategy @xmath14 .",
    "this condition for an ess is shown @xcite equivalent to the following requirements : @xmath15 it turns out @xcite that an ess is a symmetric ne that is stable against small mutations .",
    "condition a ) in the definition ( [ essdef ] ) shows @xmath16 is a ne for the bi - matrix game @xmath5 if @xmath9 is an ess .",
    "however , the converse is not true .",
    "that is , if @xmath16 is a ne then @xmath9 is an ess only if @xmath9 satisfies condition b ) in definition ( [ essdef ] ) .",
    "evolutionary game theory defines the concept of _ fitness _ @xcite of a strategy as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath9 and @xmath10 are pure strategies played by a population of players that is engaged in a two - player game .",
    "their fitnesses are @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19  are frequencies ( the relative proportions ) of the pure strategies @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "it turned out that an ess is a refinement on the set of symmetric nash equilibria @xcite . for symmetric bi - matrix games",
    "this relationship is described @xcite as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the sets of symmetric ne , symmetric proper equilibrium , and esss respectively .",
    "the property of an ess of being robust against small mutations is also referred to as _ evolutionary stability _ _ _  _ _ @xcite .",
    "this concept provided a significant part of the motivation for later developments in evolutionary game theory . in evolutionary game theory ,",
    "the darwinian natural selection is formulated as an algorithm called _ replicator dynamics _",
    "@xcite which is a mathematical statement saying that in a population the proportion of players playing better strategies increases with time .",
    "mathematically , esss come out as the _ rest points _ of replicator dynamics @xcite .",
    "evolutionary stability was found to be a useful concept because it says something about the dynamic properties of a system without being committed to a particular dynamic model .",
    "sometimes , it is also described as a model of rationality which is physically grounded in natural selection .",
    "evolutionary game theory introduces so - called the _ population setting _",
    "@xcite _ _",
    "_ _ that is also known as _ population - statistical setting _ .",
    "this setting assumes a ) an infinite population of players who are engaged in random pair - wise contests b ) each player being programmed to play only one strategy and c ) an evolutionary pressure ensuring that better - performing strategies have better chances of survival at the expense of other competing strategies .",
    "because of b ) one can refer to better - performing players as better - performing strategies .",
    "the population setting of evolutionary game theory is not alien to the concept of the ne , although it may give such an impression .",
    "in fact , john nash himself had this setting in his mind when he introduced this concept in game theory . in his unpublished ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite he wrote ` _ _ it is unnecessary to assume that the participants have ... the ability to go through any complex reasoning process .",
    "but the participants are supposed to accumulate empirical information on the various pure strategies at their disposal ... we assume that there is a population ... of participants ... and that there is a stable average frequency with which a pure strategy is employed by the `` average member '' of the appropriate population _ _ ' .",
    "that is , nash had suggested a population interpretation of the ne concept in which players are randomly drawn from large populations .",
    "nash assumed that these players were not aware of the total structure of the game and did not have either the ability nor inclination to go through any complex reasoning process .",
    "this chapter considers evolutionary stability in quantum games that are played in the two quantization schemes : eisert , wilkens , lewenstein ( ewl ) scheme @xcite for playing quantum prisoners dilemma ( pd ) and marinatto and weber ( mw ) scheme @xcite for playing quantum battle of sexes ( bos ) game .",
    "ewl quantization scheme appeared soon after meyer s publication @xcite of the pq penny - flip  a quantum game that generated significant interest and is widely believed to have led to the creation of the new research field of quantum games .",
    "mw scheme derives from ewl scheme but it gives a different meaning to the term ` strategy ' @xcite .",
    "ewl quantum pd assigns two basis vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the hilbert space of a qubit .",
    "states of the two qubits belong to two - dimensional hilbert spaces @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",

    ".    one may ask how and where the population setting may be relevant to quantum games . how can a setting , originally developed to model the population biology problems , be relevant and useful to quantum games ?",
    "one can often sharpen this argument given the fact that , to date , almost all of the experimental realizations of quantum games are artificially constructed in laboratories using quantum computational circuits @xcite .",
    "several replies can be made to this question , for example , that this setting was behind the development of the ne concept that was addressed in the earliest constructions of quantum games attracting significant attention .",
    "one also finds that evolutionary stability has very rich literature in game theory , mathematical biology and in evolutionary economics @xcite . in quantum games",
    "the ne has been discussed in relation to quantum entanglement @xcite and the possibility that the same can be done with evolutionary stability clearly opens a new interesting role for this quantum phenomenon .",
    "it is conjectured that the possibility of this extended role for entanglement may perhaps be helpful to better understand entanglement itself .",
    "evolutionary stability presents a game - theoretic model to understand evolutionary dynamics .",
    "recent developments in quantum games motivate to ask how this game - theoretic solution concept adapts / shapes / changes itself when players are given access to quantum strategies .",
    "this questions is clearly related to a bigger question : can quantum mechanics have a role in directing , or possibly dictating , the dynamics of evolution ?",
    "we believe that for an analysis along this direction the evolutionary stability offers an interesting situation because , firstly , it is a simple and a beautiful concept and , secondly , it is supported by extensive literature @xcite .    to discuss evolutionary stability in quantum games",
    "may appear as if a concept originally developed for population biology problems is arbitrarily being placed within the domain of quantum games .",
    "one can reply to this by noticing that population biology is not the only relevant domain for the concept of evolutionary stability .",
    "this concept can also be interpreted using infinitely repeated two - player games and without referring to a population of players . secondly ,",
    "as the nash s thesis @xcite showed it , it is not the population biology alone that motivates a population setting for game theory ",
    "responsible for the concept of evolutionary stability .",
    "surprisingly , the concept of ne also does the same , although it may not be recognized generally .",
    "the usual approach in game theory consists of analyzing games among hyper - rational players who are always found both ready and engaged in their selfish interests to optimize their payoffs or utilities .",
    "evolutionary stability has roots in the efforts to get rid of this usual approach that game theory had followed .",
    "the lesson it teaches is that playing games can be disassociated from players capacity to make rational decisions .",
    "this disassociation seems equally valid in those possible situations where nature plays quantum games .",
    "it is because associating rationality to quantum - interacting entities is of even a more remote possibility than it is the case when this association is made to bacteria and viruses , whose behavior evolutionary game theory explains .    in the following",
    "we will try to address the following questions : how esss are affected when a classical game , played by a population , changes itself to a quantum form ?",
    "how pure and mixed esss are distinguished from one another when such a change in the form of a game takes place ?",
    "can quantum games provide a route that can relate evolutionary dynamics , for example , to quantum entanglement ? considering a population of players in which a classical strategy has established itself as an ess , we would like to ask : a ) what happens when ` mutants ' of ess theory come up with quantum strategies and try to invade the classical ess ?",
