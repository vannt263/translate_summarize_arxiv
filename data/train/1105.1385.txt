    "the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) in 1982@xcite has proven to be one of the most significant experimental findings in all of physics .",
    "the incompressible quantum fluid that manifests in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system in the presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field at low temperatures can not be explained by the  conventional \" landau theory of phase transitions@xcite .",
    "instead this unique phase is an example of an emergent topological state of matter , where the charged quasi - particle excitations are governed by anyonic rather than fermionic or bosonic statistics@xcite .",
    "the unique nature of fqhe becomes obvious with the realization that the phenomenon occurs only in the truly strongly interacting limit of vanishing ( or extremely small ) kinetic energy with the noninteracting ground state having a macroscopically large degeneracy .",
    "although the fqhe was discovered decades ago@xcite , many questions still linger to this day .",
    "the most notable of these is the nature of the fqh state observed at electron filling fraction @xmath4 .",
    "first discovered in 1987@xcite , the @xmath2 state is ( so far ) the only exception to the famous ",
    "odd denominator \" rule for monolayer fqh systems given by the laughlin ansatz@xcite and the more general  composite fermion \" theory@xcite .",
    "( the odd denominator rule assumes fqhe in a monolayer system .",
    "bilayer fqh systems , however , have several even denominator states that are well - understood .",
    "see , for example refs .  ) . currently , the leading theoretical candidate for the @xmath2 state is the moore - read ( mr ) pfaffian model state introduced by moore and read in 1990@xcite .",
    "recently it has been noted that the particle - hole conjugate to the mr pfaffian , the so - called anti - pfaffian  @xcite , is also a viable candidate for the fqhe at @xmath2 .",
    "an exceptional feature of these ansatz is the prediction of anyonic quasi - particles with non - abelian braiding statistics  @xcite .",
    "this prediction is attractive given the current interest in topological quantum computing  @xcite , but the true nature of the fqh @xmath2 state is , by no means , a settled question@xcite .",
    "directly probing the topological nature of fqh states has proven to be both a theoretical and an experimental challenge , making definitive and uncontroversial verification of the mr pfaffian ansatz elusive .",
    "however , recent developments in the field of quantum information have shown that measures of entanglement are useful tools in examining the global features of many - body strongly correlated quantum states@xcite .",
    "the true nature of the @xmath2 fqhe state is one of the most prominent open questions in condensed matter physics , and is a primary motivation for the current study .",
    "recent experimental studies have explored this mysterious state and give some weight to the moore - read theory that is believed to explain it .",
    "one of these studies is the recent experiment by venkatachalam _",
    "@xcite that measured the charge of localized excitations in the @xmath2 state to be @xmath5 as predicted by the mr theory@xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with previous studies by radu _ et .",
    "al . _ and dolev _",
    "that used shot noise to investigate the local charge  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the experiments noted above , willett _ et .",
    "@xcite have seen evidence of quasiparticle interference oscillations that support the existence of charge @xmath5 excitations at @xmath2 .",
    "another recent study is work performed by bid _ _ et .",
    "al.__@xcite that experimentally observed the theorized neutral mode of the @xmath2 state consistent with the mr theory@xcite . although these developments point to the mr theory as the likely candidate for the @xmath2 state , they are not sufficient to unambiguously establish the existence of non - abelian anyons .",
    "also , it should be noted that the mr theory predicts a spin polarized state at @xmath2 , but recent experimental work  @xcite suggest that this state may be unpolarized in some cases .",
    "although we do not consider spin in this work , we attempt to leverage recent developments in quantum information theory to observe topological features predicted by the laughlin and mr theory in numerically obtained fqhe ground states and examine how these features change under a realistic change ( in particular , the finite thickness effect with varying thickness ) in the effective interaction .    these developments in quantum information theory provide the context for our current work . in this article",
    "we provide a detailed numerical theoretical study of entanglement for fqhe states incorporating the dependence on the quasi-2d layer thickness of the transverse dimension ( i.e the finite layer thickness effect@xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize physics of the finite - thickness effect in this article partly because it provides a qualitative understanding of the fqhe in higher landau levels as shown in ref .  .",
    "indeed , the orbital landau level ( ll ) dependence of the fqhe is not completely understood  @xcite .",
    "the theory behind the mr pfaffian model state , for example , makes no distinction between the half - filled second orbital landau level ( sll ) ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) and the half - filled lowest orbital landau level ( lll ) ( @xmath3 ) , but no fqhe has so far been observed at @xmath3 in monolayer systems . furthermore fqh states in the sll are relatively rare and generally `` weaker '' ( i.e. , requiring lower temperatures and higher sample mobilities to experimentally observe due to their relatively small energy gaps on the order of 0.5 k or less ) compared to fqh states in the lll@xcite .",
    "some light was shed on this phenomenon of fragility of the fqhe in the sll in ref .   where it is shown that the finite - thickness effect is qualitatively dependent on landau level .",
    "in particular , it is shown that a finite , non - zero , layer thickness , @xmath0 , helps stabilize the fqhe in the sll , whereas in the lll , finite @xmath0 tends to  weaken \" the state .",
    "also , for the @xmath2 state , there appears to be an optimal thickness where the mr pfaffian is `` strongest . ''",
    "thus , there seems to be a close connection between finite thickness and the sll fqhe , which we explore in this work by calculating the thickness dependent entanglement properties of the fqhe .",
    "the results given in ref .",
    "are primarily based on calculations of the overlap between numerically obtained ground states and model fqhe wavefunctions  @xcite  in particular , the laughlin and mr pfaffian model states .",
    "although the overlap is a powerful theoretical tool  in fact , the wide acceptance of the laughlin wavefunction as the appropriate description of the experimentally observed odd - denominator fqhe is arguably based on overlap results  it is not always definitive and can be misleading in some cases .",
    "an example of this involves the @xmath6 state that has been shown to have a large overlap with both the jain composite fermion wavefunction as well as the so - called  gaffnian \" wavefunction , even though these two states have different underlying topological order belonging to different universality classes  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we seek alternative theoretical tools to probe the landau level dependence of the fqhe through the finite - thickness effect , which should inevitably give insight into the nature of the enigmatic @xmath2 state . in this article",
    ", we examine bipartite entanglement as an alternative measure ( in particular the entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum ) and study its dependence on finite layer thickness , @xmath0 , in quasi-2d fqh states .",
    "one reason for our study of the thickness - dependent fqhe entanglement is that the thickness parameter @xmath0 enables a continuous tuning of the hamiltonian , lending to a continuous variation in the entanglement allowing a comprehensive systematic study .",
    "bipartite entanglement measures are tools designed to quantify the extent to which degrees of freedom are entangled in a bipartitioned system@xcite .",
    "the most straight forward of these is the entanglement entropy ( ee ) , defined as the the von - neuman entropy @xmath7\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of the reduced density matrix @xmath8 $ ] for state @xmath9 in a fock space @xmath10 that has been partitioned into two parts .",
    "the ee has proven to be a very powerful tool in examining quantum correlations in interacting many - body systems@xcite .",
    "in particular , the scaling of the entanglement entropy with system size has been shown to follow certain `` area '' laws that can identify quantum phase transitions in certain cases@xcite .",
    "also , the ee can be used to extract the `` topological entanglement entropy '' which is an indicator of topological order in the system@xcite ( i.e. states in the same topological class will have the same topological entanglement entropy ) . given these developments ,",
    "the ee and the topological ee appear to be attractive tools to probe fqh states .",
    "however , as we discuss below in more detail , obtaining a precise quantitative estimate of the topological entropy in fqh states requires a technical procedure prone to introducing significant errors  @xcite . in our study , we do not attempt to make such an estimate",
    ". instead we focus on fqhe states with the primary objective of observing the qualitative behavior of the ee as a function of finite layer thickness , @xmath0 , in the lll and sll .",
    "our goal is to obtain the qualitative dependence of the ee in fqhe as a function of layer thickness @xmath0 .",
    "we also investigate the `` entanglement spectrum '' of quasi-2d fqh states in this study .",
    "introduced by li and haldane@xcite , the entanglement spectrum ( es ) provides more information than the entanglement entropy alone .",
    "in particular , li and haldane conjectured that there is a direct correspondence between the low - lying eigenvalues of the operator @xmath11 $ ] and the edge modes of the system and , thus , es can be used to determine characteristics of the underlying conformal field theory ( cft ) of the corresponding fqh ground state .",
    "as long as these `` cft - like '' states are well - separated from the `` generic non - cft - like '' states in the entanglement spectrum of the ground state in the thermodynamic limit , then it is conjectured that the identified cft does , indeed , describe the state .",
    "in other words , states described the by the same cft ( i.e. in the same universality class ) will have the same low - lying structure in their respective entanglement spectra . numerical studies  @xcite and some recent analytical results  @xcite support the li and haldane conjecture .",
    "in our study , we carefully examine the entanglement spectrum of finite sized fqhe states by quantifying the separations between the suspected low - lying cft and non - cft - like states ( `` entanglement gaps '' ) as a function of finite - layer thickness .",
    "the entanglement gaps serve as a semi - quantitative measure of how well the state in a finite system fits with the universality class described by the cft . by doing this",
    "we discover that the entanglement gaps follow trends qualitatively similar to the ee , leading to similar conclusions obtained in the overlap calculations given in ref .",
    "( i.e. , that the finite - thickness effect strengthens the fqh states in the sll ) .",
    "we also examine the entanglement spectrum in the so - called  conformal limit \"  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the conformal limit is to remove finite size artifacts from the geometry of the system ( in our case , the sphere ) , allowing for a concrete definition of a full entanglement gap .",
    "we find that the conformal limit does result in a full entanglement gap in most cases studied , but not in all situations .",
    "the lack of a entanglement gap in these exceptional cases , however , is likely due to our choice of planar pseudo - potentials in our work@xcite ; further work along this line would be necessary to fully understand these situations .",
    "the structure of this article is as follows : in section [ sec : method ] we describe our methods for numerically obtaining the exact ground state of the coulombic hamiltonian for fqh ground states at filling fractions @xmath12 , 7/3 , 1/2 , and 5/2 and our chosen model of the finite thickness of the quasi-2d system as well as the model wavefunctions ( laughlin and mr pfaffian ) to which we compare the numerically obtained ground state .",
    "further , we describe how our entanglement measures are defined and calculated . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we provide our results for the entanglement entropy ( [ sec : ee ] ) , entanglement gaps in the entanglement spectrum ( [ sec : es ] ) , entanglement spectra in the conformal limit ( [ sec : cl ] ) and density of states calculations of entanglement spectra ( [ sec : dos ] ) for fqh ground states at the filling fractions listed above .",
    "we provide our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] . finally in the appendix",
    ", we discuss our choice of planar haldane pseudopotentials over spherical pseudopotentials and examine the implications of this choice by comparing entanglement spectra in fqhe ground states at zero thickness obtained with either choice of pseudopotentials .",
    "we begin by considering a quasi-2d geometry where spinless electrons are confined in the x - y plane with layer thickness @xmath0 along the z - axis and an external magnetic field @xmath13 also along the z - axis . in the non - interacting case",
    ", the presence of the magnetic field quantizes the electron energy levels into highly degenerate landau levels ( ll ) with energies @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a non - negative integer that defines the ll index .",
    "the degeneracy of each ll per unit area is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the magnetic length and defines a length scale for the problem .",
    "the filling factor is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the particle density per unit area .",
    "when we include spin , the degeneracy of each landau level is doubled .",
    "if we assume the electrons are polarized by the magnetic field and the ll s are filled sequentially by spin up and spin down electrons , then @xmath21 corresponds to states in the lowest landau level ( lll ) with ll index @xmath22 and @xmath23 corresponds to the second landau level ( sll ) with ll index @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the 1/2-filled lll corresponds to @xmath25 or 3/2 and the 1/2-filled sll corresponds to @xmath2 or 7/2 .",
    "the identifications of the 1/3-filled filling factors is obtained similarly .",
    "the presence of electron - electron interactions clearly complicates this picture , but if we assume the electrons are confined to a single ll ( i.e. , there is no ll mixing ) , then the kinetic energy is a constant that can be ignored , giving the effective hamiltonian : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total number of particles and @xmath28 is the distance between particles measured in units of the magnetic length @xmath29 .",
    "note that our assumption of no ll mixing might not be a very good approximation  @xcite in all cases especially when considering the fqh state at @xmath2 where it has been observed at  low \" magnetic fields where the ll mixing parameter @xmath30/\\hbar\\omega_c\\sim 1 $ ] ( @xmath31 characterizes the strength of the coulomb interaction where @xmath32 is the electron charge and @xmath33 is the dielectric constant of the host semiconductor ) .",
    "furthermore , the hamiltonian we are using is completely particle - hole symmetric and apparently the ground state does not spontaneously break particle - hole symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this means that all of our conclusions about the mr pfaffian state apply equally to the anti - pfaffian state since the two ansatz are particle - hole conjugates .",
    "ll mixing , as shown recently  @xcite , can induce three - body terms which explicitly break particle - hole symmetry leading to a possible preference toward the mr pfaffian or anti - pfaffian , however , in this work we do not consider such terms and can make no distinction .",
    "this hamiltonian ( eq . ( [ eg : columbh ] ) ) can be parametrized in terms of the relative angular momentum between two particles @xmath34 by the haldane `` pseudopotential '' expansion@xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 projects onto states with relative angular momentum @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the haldane pseudopotentials for a given relative angular momentum @xmath39 and landau level index @xmath40 .",
    "these pseudopotentials @xmath41 are the energies of a pair of particles with relative angular momentum @xmath39 confined to the @xmath40-th ll . for spinless fermions , only @xmath38 for odd @xmath39 enter the hamiltonian due to the pauli exclusion principle . in a planar geometry ,",

    "this expansion allows us to work strictly in the hilbert space of the lowest landau level since all necessary information about electrons confined in higher landau levels are contained in the pseudopotentials .",

    "furthermore , the pseudopotentials in the spherical geometry equal those in the planar geometry as the thermodynamic limit is approached ( as the spherical radius is taken to infinity ) and it can be argued that they provide a better approximation to the thermodynamic limit ( this is discussed in detail in ref .   and in the appendix ) . in the spherical geometry , the perpendicular ( radial ) magnetic field",

    "this `` soft '' gap is qualitatively similar to the `` clear '' gap in the @xmath166 case and it does appear to slightly decrease as a function of @xmath55 . however , it is difficult to distinguish this `` soft '' gap from the other small gaps in the spectrum .    in fig .",

    ", a clear gap at finite ( non - zero ) thickness has a definite peak corresponding to a level crossing .",
    "below the gap , there appears to be some band crossings as @xmath55 is varied .    in summary ,",
    "the dos of the entanglement spectra ( with and without the conformal limit ) gives us a general qualitative picture of how the es evolve with a varying parameter ( i.e. , the finite layer thickness @xmath0 in our case ) .",
    "thus we expect the dos of the es to be a good initial cursory tool in examining topological states with varying parameters .",
    "in this work we study entanglement in finite sized , quasi-2d fqh states via the entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum as a function of the finite layer thickness of the transverse dimension in a realistic fqh system and compare them to the entanglement signatures of the laughlin and mr pfaffian model states . for the laughlin filling fractions , we find that the ee increases ( decreases ) with finite layer thickness for @xmath12 ( @xmath68 ) in the lll ( sll ) with increasing ( decreasing ) deviation from the ee of the laughlin model state",
    ". however the ee in the sll reaches an asymptotic value larger than the ee of the laughlin state , possibly suggesting the @xmath68 state is modeled by different physics than the laughlin state .",
    "similar behavior is also seen in the entanglement gaps of the es for the laughlin filling fractions . here",
    "we find that the entanglement gaps decrease with finite layer thickness for the laughlin filling fractions in the lll .",
    "but in the sll , the behavior of the entanglement gaps depend on the `` depth '' of the gap .",
    "these results suggest that the laughlin fqh states  weaken \" with increasing thickness in the lll , which is consistent with previous work on quasi-2d fqh states @xcite , but in the sll , other physics beyond just the laughlin state alone is needed to describe the fqh state .",
    "the ll dependence of the finite thickness effect at half - filling differs slightly .",
    "the ee of the @xmath3 state in the lll is largely insensitive to the finite layer thickness in contrast to that of the sll @xmath4 state where the ee has a local minima that approaches the ee of the mr pfaffian at finite @xmath55 .",
    "this qualitative behavior is also seen in the entanglement gaps of the es for half - filled lls . for @xmath4 in the sll , we see peaks ( local maxima ) in the entanglement gaps at finite thickness , suggesting the @xmath4 is more  mr pfaffian - like \" at an optimal thickness , which , again is consistent with previous work@xcite and strongly suggests the @xmath4 state is , indeed , mr pfaffian .",
    "in contrast the entanglement gaps of the es for the @xmath3 state suggest that it is not modeled by the mr pfaffian .",
    "thus , the entanglement gaps in the es allows us to differentiate the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states , which we could not definitively establish with the ee or the overlap calculations .",
    "of course , we must be cautious with these results since the calculated entanglement gaps made use of only a few  virasoro levels \" in the low - lying cft due to finite - size effects .",
    "assuming the li and haldane conjecture to be correct , we can only say that we have observed the laughlin and mr pfaffian signatures up to a few  virasoro levels \" .",
    "we also investigate the conformal limit of the entanglement spectrum which is conjectured to remove curvature in the spectrum due to finite size effects and allow the use of the entire spectrum to determine the topological signature of the state .",
    "our results on the conformal limit , however are inconsistent between varying system sizes and are difficult to interpret .",
    "this appears to be due to our choice of using planar pseudopotentials rather than spherical pseudopotentials in obtaining the fqhe ground states . in the appendix",
    "we examine this choice by comparing the entanglement spectra of ground states obtained by using either spherical or planar pseudopotentials at @xmath116 and observe that the conformal limit can be affected by components of the ground state that have exponentially small contributions and , therefore , are sensitive to minor details in the interaction ( such as the difference between planar and spherical pseudopotentials ) .",
    "thus the presence of the entanglement gap in the conformal limit is sensitive to certain details in the effective interaction that may not be relevant in determining the topological features of the state .",
    "further work using much larger system sizes would be necessary to resolve this issue which is well beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "we have also introduced the notion of entanglement density of states as a method for examining the idea of an entanglement gap without an explicit reliance on a model wavefunction .",
    "although , far from definitive , the entanglement dos suggests itself as a powerful tool to determine the topological nature of a particular ground state .",
    "our detailed numerical study establishes the entanglement dos to be a useful quantity underlying topological fqhe particularly in the context of finite size numerical calculations .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the entanglement measures give results similar to those obtained with overlaps in refs .  .",
    "whereas the overlap is a simple measure of how well a numerically obtained ground state matches a particular model state ( e.g. the laughlin state or the mr pfaffian state ) , the entanglement measures ( in particular , the es ) is a more general measure of how well a state fits a suspected cft ( i.e. universality class ) that describes the model state .",
    "therefore , it can be said that these results confirm the conclusions in refs .   in a more general sense in respect to the laughlin and mr pfaffian cfts .",
    "however , we must be cautious in this generalization given that we have only observed the laughlin and mr pfaffian signature up to a few  virasoro levels \" and different theories can result in the same low - level structure in the es  @xcite .",
    "more work is necessary to understand how well entanglement measures can definitely identify universality classes in finite systems .    in interpreting our results and conclusions , one may wonder about the importance of finite size effects on our numerical diagonalization .",
    "the possible limitations associated with finite - size effects are of course always present in any exact diagonalization study of any fqhe system , and the possibility that some of the conclusions are affected by finite size effects can never be ruled out even if the calculations are carried out on systems much larger than what we use in this work , since in the end any statement about an experimental system based on calculations performed on few - particle systems is always subject to an extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we believe that all our conclusions regarding the importance of finite quasi-2d thickness effect on the fqhe entanglement spectra are valid independent of the rather modest size of our finite system diagonalization study because earlier work  @xcite clearly established , when compared with calculations  @xcite carried out on much larger systems , that the system size we use in this work , namely n=8 , is certainly adequate in making qualitatively correct conclusions about the sll fqhe .",
    "our goal in this paper has been to study as many fqhe states as feasible as a function of the quasi-2d layer thickness in depth , thus necessarily ( due to the computational time restrictions ) limiting our system size to n=8 which should be adequate .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that future work should explore larger system size diagonalization in order to study the finite - thickness effect on the entanglement spectra of various fqhe states .",
    "we also note that there are various alternatives to the infinite square well effective potential in examining the finite thickness effect .",
    "the zhang - das sarma potential is likely the most well - known and oft - used alternative in this regard .",
    "we choose to focus on the infinite square well instead of the zhang - das sarma potential because the infinite square well is more closely aligned to realistic quasi-2d systems .",
    "moreover many observables calculated with the zhang - das sarma potential besides the overlap have been shown to give similar results compared to the infinite square well .",
    "therefore we expect the two potentials to give similar results with entanglement measures as well , but since investigating the nature of these potentials is not a goal of the present study , we leave explicit verification of this assertion for a future work .",
    "it should be noted that the concept of entanglement spectra ( or for that matter , the entanglement entropy itself ) has no direct experimental or observational implications since it can not be directly measured .",
    "the concept is useful conceptually and theoretically in ascertaining the quantum topological nature of a particular interacting hamiltonian , and in that sense its experimental consequences are indirect since the topological nature of a system has obvious experimental consequences . we have investigated in this work the utility of the concept of the entanglement spectra in ascertaining the underlying topological nature of realistic fqhe states as a function of the quasi-2d layer thickness , finding that the entanglement spectrum provides results consistent with what has earlier been established in the literature based on the wavefunction overlap studies .",
    "our very detailed study also indicates that at this stage of theoretical development , the entanglement approach is perhaps no more predictive in providing experimental implications of various fqhe states than what is already available in the literature based on the direct wavefunction overlap studies .",
    "further work would be necessary to see if the entanglement approach has some specific advantages in predicting experimental properties of fqhe states not already apparent in wavefunction - based analyses .    in conclusion",
    ", we have extended the concept of topological entanglement spectra and entanglement gaps to finite - thickness fqh systems by calculating the fqhe topological properties systemically as a function of finite thickness of the quasi-2d systems , establishing in the process that the fqhe entanglement measures calculated as a function of system thickness are completely consistent with the results obtained earlier in the literature using wavefunction overlap calculations .",
    "while our work establishes various entanglement measures as important theoretical quantities classifying fqhe , more work will be necessary to understand the finite size aspects of entanglement spectra and entanglement gaps in the context of realistic fractional quantum hall systems .",
    "although it is gratifying that the qualitative conclusions of our entanglement - measure - based results in this work are completely consistent with earlier fqhe results obtained on the basis of wavefunction overlap calculations , it remains to be seen whether the entanglement - measure based probes have more predictive power regarding the nature of fqhe than the wavefunction - overlap based probes or it is simply a deeper way of looking at the same physics with no obvious additional implications for the experimental occurrence of fqhe .",
    "the analysis presented above is based on ground state wavefunctions obtained by diagonalizing the quasi-2d coulomb potential in a spherical geometry .",
    "however the haldane pseudopotentials used to construct the hamiltonian are derived from a infinite planar geometry rather than a spherical geometry .",
    "we choose to use planar rather than spherical psuedopotentials because ( i ) the effective coulomb potential in a quasi-2d system is more naturally obtained in the infinite planar geometry and ( ii ) we expect the spherical and planar pseudopotentials to be indistinguishable in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "moreover given the mostly qualitative nature involved in studying entanglement spectra , we expected this choice to make little difference in the results",
    ". nevertheless , there are cases under study where this choice matters .",
    "the goal of this appendix is to highlight some of these cases .",
    "we show that for @xmath116 , the low energy spectrum in the entanglement spectra are qualitatively similar between ground states obtained from either spherical or planar pseudopotentials , but higher energy spectra can can differ in some cases .",
    "this difference does not change the qualitative conclusions drawn from the low energy spectra , but when we consider the conformal limit which looks for a full entanglement gap , the difference can lead to different conclusions ( in particular , the case of @xmath12 with @xmath123 ) .",
