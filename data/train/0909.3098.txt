    "clusters of galaxies have a long history as cosmological laboratories , beginning with the discovery of dark matter @xcite through studies of cluster galaxy orbits , and providing early evidence for a low matter density universe @xcite through studies of their baryonic and dark matter content .",
    "these breakthroughs rested on observations of the properties of individual systems , but the population of clusters as a whole also contains a great deal of cosmological information .",
    "clusters represent the most massive gravitationally bound systems in the universe , and as such their abundance probes the amount of structure in the universe and its growth over cosmic time .",
    "the local cluster population has been used to jointly constrain the average density of matter , @xmath9 , and the amplitude of density perturbations , @xmath10 ( recently by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see also @xcite and additional references in @xcite , hereafter ) .",
    "most recently , the construction of x - ray flux - limited cluster samples out to redshift @xmath11 and beyond has enabled studies of the growth of structure (; * ? ? ?",
    "such studies provide an important new window on cosmology , as various dark energy and modified gravity models designed to explain the acceleration of the cosmic expansion are potentially distinguishable by their effects on structure formation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the key ingredients for investigations of the cluster population are ( 1 ) a cluster survey with a well understood selection function , . ] and ( 2 ) scaling relations that link cluster mass to observable quantities .",
    "currently , the most successful approach to finding massive clusters over a range of redshifts is through the x - ray emission of the hot intracluster gas , although sunyaev - zeldovich and optical surveys are also making significant progress .",
    "because malmquist and eddington biases are ubiquitous in current x - ray flux - limited samples , great care is warranted in their analysis .",
    "in particular , precise , robust cosmological constraints can only be obtained by simultaneously fitting the x - ray luminosity  mass relation , as we do here .",
    "conversely , rigorous analysis of the scaling relations must take into account the cluster mass function and the selection function of the data set , as discussed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ; see also @xcite ) .    while a flux - limited sample , combined with more detailed follow - up observations of a subset of clusters in that sample , may contain the necessary information to provide simultaneous constraints on cosmology and scaling relations , a fully self - consistent statistical framework for this analysis has been lacking to this point . by `` self - consistent '' , we mean that a single likelihood function applying to the full data set ( survey + follow - up observations ) and encompassing the entire theoretical model ( cosmology + scaling relations ) should be derived from first principles , ensuring that the covariance among all the model parameters is fully captured and that the effects of the mass function and selection biases are properly accounted for throughout .",
    "this is the first of a series of papers in which we address these issues .",
    "contains details of the follow - up x - ray observations and their reduction , presents the constraints on scaling relations from our simultaneous analysis , and discusses their astrophysical implications . in this paper",
    ", we present the statistical methods applied to the problems described above and the resulting cosmological constraints .",
    "the dark energy models we address here include the simple cosmological constant model ; models with a constant dark energy equation of state , @xmath0 ; and simple evolving @xmath0 models . as we will show , our analysis produces some of the tightest constraints on dark energy parameters of any experiment to date . in papers  iii @xcite and iv @xcite , we respectively apply our analysis to investigations of modified gravity and neutrino properties .    in section  [ sec : data ] , we briefly review the cluster data set , which is more fully described in .",
    "section  [ sec : modeling ] contains a full description of the theoretical model fit to the data , including the cosmology , cluster mass function , and scaling relations .",
    "the new , self - consistent analysis method is presented in section  [ sec : likelihood ] .",
    "sections  [ sec : results ] and [ sec : systematics ] respectively contain the cosmological results of our analysis and a discussion of relevant systematics .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the conventional definition of cluster radius in terms of the critical density of the universe ; thus , @xmath12 is the radius within which the mean density of the cluster is @xmath13 times the critical density at the cluster s redshift , @xmath14 .",
    "an alternative convention , used particularly in the literature relevant to the mass function , is to define the overdensity with respect to the mean matter density at redshift @xmath15 .",
    "we will consistently use the former convention , and so , for example , an overdensity of 300 with respect to the matter density will be written as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the ratio of the mean matter density to the critical density .",
    "the galaxy cluster data used in this work , as well as their selection and reduction , are discussed in detail in . using three wide - area cluster samples drawn from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  the _ rosat _ brightest cluster sample ( bcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the _ rosat_-eso flux - limited x - ray sample ( reflex ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the bright sub - sample of the massive cluster survey ( bright macs ; @xcite ; @xcite )  we select a statistically complete sample of 238 x - ray luminous clusters covering the redshift range @xmath18 . of these 238 clusters ,",
    "94 have follow - up _ chandra _ or _ rosat _ observations that we incorporate into the analysis . to distinguish it from cluster data used in other cosmological work ( e.g. optically selected clusters ) , we refer to this data set as the cluster x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) ,",
    "although in fact the data set contains a great deal more information than the luminosity function alone . from the follow - up observations ,",
    "we measure x - ray luminosity , average temperature , and gas mass within @xmath19 . the gas mass is used as a proxy for total mass , using the finding of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) that the gas mass fraction , @xmath20 , is a constant for the hot , massive clusters being studied . as a proxy for total mass rather than the thermal energy , @xmath21 , because @xmath22 can be measured more precisely than temperature for a given exposure time , and because @xmath22 measurements at @xmath19 are minimally affected by background and emission weighting uncertainties .",
    "in addition , @xmath22 displays exceptionally small scatter with mass ( see and ) in the mass range considered here , @xmath23 . ] the systematic uncertainty associated with the @xmath24 measurement is accounted for by simultaneously constraining the full @xmath24 model of , which includes generous systematic allowances for instrument calibration , non - thermal pressure support , the depletion of baryons in clusters relative to the cosmic mean , and evolution in the baryon depletion and stellar content of clusters .",
    "we use only the six lowest redshift clusters from ( @xmath25 ) , which are sufficient to constrain the gas mass fraction at low redshift without directly producing a constraint on dark energy by themselves . in our analysis of the xlf data",
    ", we also use gaussian priors to constrain the hubble parameter and the mean baryon density , based on the results of the hubble key project ( @xmath26 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and big bang nucleosynthesis studies ( @xmath27 , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , we compare and combine results from our own analysis with those of independent cosmological data , including the full cluster @xmath24 data set , as well as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , type ia supernova ( snia ) and baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data .",
    "our analysis of the cmb anisotropies uses 5-year _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) data @xcite with the march 2008 version of the _ wmap _ likelihood code @xcite .",
    "the snia results are derived from the union compilation @xcite , which includes data from a variety of sources ( 307 snia in total ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , including the treatment of systematic errors employed by kowalski et  al .",
    "our analysis of bao data uses the constraints on the ratio of the sound horizon to the distance scale at @xmath28 and @xmath29 derived by @xcite from the galaxy correlation function in 2df @xcite and sloan digital sky survey @xcite data .",
    "when fitting cmb data , we allow the scalar spectral index , @xmath30 , and optical depth to reionization , @xmath31 , to vary as free parameters , and marginalize over a plausible range in the amplitude of the sunyaev - zeldovich signal due to galaxy clusters ( @xmath32 ; introduced by @xcite ) . the combination of cmb and @xmath24 data places tight constraints on both @xmath33 and @xmath34 in addition to other parameters of interest ( see ) , so the hubble key project and big bang nucleosynthesis priors are unnecessary in analyses of the combined data sets .",
    "this applies as well to the combination of cmb and xlf data , since we always use the @xmath25 subset of the @xmath24 data to calibrate the cluster mass scale for the xlf analysis .",
    "in this section , we detail the various pieces of the model being fit to the xlf data .",
    "section  [ sec : cosmodel ] reviews the important cosmological parameters and the dark energy models to be addressed , while section  [ sec : massfunction ] focuses on the predicted mass function and its cosmological dependence . in section",
    "[ sec : scalingmodel ] , we outline the model for the cluster scaling relations . sections  [ sec : samplingmodel ] and [ sec : surveymodel ] describe the sampling model , i.e. the model for how a set of parameters predicts the measured data , including measurement errors and their correlation , and implicit dependences on reference cosmological values .",
    "the model parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : paramlist ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : results ]      in our standard analysis , we have used the mass function of @xcite with cluster radius defined by an overdensity of @xmath35 .",
    "one could also justify using the mass function determined at a cluster radius closer to the radius where the follow - up mass measurements are made , @xmath19 .",
    "we therefore repeated the xlf analysis using the mass function given by tinker et  al .",
    "for overdensity @xmath36 .",
    "for @xmath37 values of 0.20.3 and @xmath18 , this corresponds to overdensities of 3001000 , compared with 50200 for @xmath35 .",
    "our results with this alternative mass function were virtually identical to the standard results .",
    "similarly , we repeated the analysis using the older mass function of @xcite at overdensity @xmath38 .",
    "here we used a 20 per cent gaussian systematic allowance on only the normalization of the mass function and fixed the shape , as in .",
    "again , the cosmological results were essentially identical to our standard results , despite the fact that the jenkins function does not include evolution with redshift , while the tinker function does .",
    "this indifference to the details of the mass function is consistent with the observation in section  [ sec : priors ] that the current results are insensitive to the systematic allowances on the mass function and its evolution .",
    "a major , recent ( 21 january 2009 ) update to the _ chandra _ acis effective area at soft energies is accounted for in our analysis of follow - up _ chandra _ observations for the xlf data ( see ) . however , the raw data analysis in predates this calibration update , which in our tests typically results in an increase in the inferred gas fraction of @xmath39 per cent .",
    "we have accounted for this correction by shifting the center of the `` _ chandra _ calibration '' nuisance parameter in the model such that the preferred value of @xmath24 increases correspondingly by 10 per cent .",
    "the gaussian prior on this parameter also has a width of 10 per cent , so this systematic allowance encompasses both the old value and the new value expected from the calibration update .    the effect of this higher gas mass fraction is to shift the @xmath37 constraint from the @xmath24 analysis to lower values by approximately 0.02 .",
    "a corresponding shift appears in the xlf results , since the @xmath37 constraints are partially driven by our use of a subset of the @xmath24 data to set the overall cluster mass scale .",
    "the correction additionally results in a shift of similar magnitude towards lower @xmath10 values , but has no effect on the determination of @xmath0 . while we expect that the 10 per cent gaussian allowance adequately reflects the systematic uncertainty in the overall _ chandra _ calibration , these trends should be kept in mind in interpreting our results .",
    "for example , if we have overestimated the effect that the calibration update has on the value of @xmath24 , our best fit results will shift slightly to higher @xmath37 and @xmath10 .",
    "we have presented cosmological constraints obtained from an x - ray flux - limited sample of 238 massive galaxy clusters spanning the redshift range @xmath18 . follow - up _ chandra _ or _ rosat _ x - ray observations of 94 of these clusters are incorporated , as detailed in .",
    "our analysis accounts for all selection biases , includes conservative allowances for systematic uncertainties , and , for the first time , produces simultaneous constraints on cosmology and the cluster scaling relations using a rigorous and fully self - consistent statistical method .",
    "the incorporation of follow - up data and our improved analysis method result in cosmological constraints that are a factor of 23 better than our previous results in , which were based on the same flux - limited sample of clusters .",
    "the results presented here are among the tightest and most robust constraints on cosmological parameters available from current data .",
    "the constraints on spatially flat , cosmological constant models from our xlf data are @xmath1 and @xmath2 . introducing a constant dark energy equation of state , @xmath0 , as a free parameter , we find @xmath40 , obtaining the same tight constraints on @xmath37 and @xmath10 .",
    "these results confirm at higher precision the first constraints on the dark energy equation of state from the analysis of xlf data reported by , and are consistent with independent findings based on cluster gas mass fractions , cmb anisotropies , type ia supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillations , galaxy redshift surveys , and cosmic shear .",
    "we also find good agreement with recent , independent analyses of x - ray selected galaxy clusters @xcite and optically selected clusters @xcite .    using the combination of xlf , @xmath24 , wmap5 , snia and bao data , we investigate evolving @xmath0 models , including the standard @xmath41 model as well as a @xmath42 model in which the transition scale factor , @xmath43 , is marginalized over . in both cases , the best current cosmological data remain consistent with a constant value of @xmath44 .",
    "the constraints on the non - flat @xmath41 model from the combination of current data are equivalent to detf figure of merit @xmath45^{-1}=15.5 $ ] .",
    "compared with the figure of merit of 8.3 reported by @xcite from the combination of wmap5 , snia and bao data , this result highlights the contribution of cluster data ( xlf and @xmath24 ) , and their complementarity to other cosmological information .",
    "currently , the most significant systematic limitation on our results for @xmath37 and @xmath10 is systematic uncertainty in the cluster gas mass fraction , @xmath24 .",
    "specifically , the dominant uncertainty in the determination of @xmath37 is in the depletion of baryons in clusters relative to the cosmic mean , for which a 20 per cent systematic allowance is adopted in the present work .",
    "the prospect of significant improvement here exists , as numerical simulations incorporate more complete treatments of baryonic physics , especially feedback and star formation processes in the centers of clusters .",
    "the results on @xmath10 are limited by our knowledge of the non - thermal pressure in clusters and the overall calibration of x - ray temperature measurements ; cluster mass measurements via gravitational lensing provide an observational means of circumventing this issue , by directly constraining the overall mass scale of the data .",
    "xlf results on dark energy remain statistically limited .",
    "the incorporation of additional x - ray , sz ( e.g. planck , the south pole telescope and the atacama cosmology telescope ) and optical / near - infrared ( e.g. the dark energy survey and pan - stars ) cluster surveys could lead to significant near - term improvements , although we stress that these surveys must have well - understood selection functions , sampling models , and scaling relations .",
    "the possibility also remains that cosmological simulations of the mass function including the effects of dark energy perturbations will reveal additional constraining power .",
    "it is therefore important to pursue a theoretical understanding of the effects of fluid dark energy on nonlinear structure formation , even as much larger x - ray ( erosita ) , and optical ( e.g. the large synoptic survey telescope ) cluster surveys promise to increase the data available for cluster cosmology by orders of magnitude .",
    "we note that the statistical approach described in this work has significance for the planning of follow - up observations for future cluster surveys .",
    "our method permits the use of partial follow - up , allowing scaling relations to be directly and robustly constrained over a wide range in mass without raising the cost in exposure time prohibitively , as would be the case for a complete , exhaustive follow - up campaign . at the same time",
    ", the incorporation of follow - up data provides a significant advantage over pure self - calibration approaches . in detail , any plan for x - ray follow - up observations of future surveys should also account for the additional benefit of observing dynamically relaxed clusters suitable for the @xmath24 test ; as we have shown , the combination of cluster @xmath24 data , which directly probe the expansion of the universe , and the xlf , which measures the growth of structure , can provide precise cosmological constraints independent of cmb and snia observations .    readers interested in the simultaneous constraints on cluster scaling relations produced in this work should refer to .",
