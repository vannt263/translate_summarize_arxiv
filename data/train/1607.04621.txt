    "wall - bounded turbulent shear flows are of general interest in many engineering applications .",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) turbulent channel flow bounded by two parallel walls is one of the canonical flow considered for direct numerical simulation ( dns ) . starting with the seminal work of kim _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , many dnss have been performed for increasingly higher reynolds number , taking advantage of the growing power of supercomputers ( see , e.g. , a review article @xcite ) .",
    "currently the dns with the highest friction based reynolds number , @xmath0 , of @xmath1 has been carried out by lee and moser  @xcite .",
    "turbulent flows are typically characterized by the excitation of a multitude of spatial and temporal scales , which involves a large number of degrees of freedom interacting nonlinearly .",
    "self - organization of the flow into coherent vortices is observed , even at large reynolds number  @xcite , where one observes that these vortices are superimposed to a random background flow  @xcite .",
    "moreover , turbulence exhibits significant spatial and temporal intermittency , especially in the dissipative range .",
    "this implies that the strongest contributions become sparser and sparser while going to small scale in space and time .",
    "wavelets being well - localized functions in space and in scale , they yield efficient multi - scale decompositions , which have been applied to analyze , model and compute turbulent flows since 1988  @xcite .",
    "decomposing turbulent flows into a wavelet basis yields a sparse representation , namely the most energetic contributions are concentrated in few wavelet coefficients having strong intensity , while the large majority of the remaining wavelet coefficients have negligibly small intensity .",
    "the presence of coherent structures superimposed to a random background flow motivated the development of the coherent vorticity extraction ( cve ) method .",
    "the idea of cve , proposed by farge _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , defines coherent structures as what remains after denoising the flow vorticity .",
    "vorticity is better localized in space than velocity , and thus more intermittent , its wavelet decomposition is sparser and only few coefficients are necessary to represent the coherent structures .",
    "the main reason is that , in contrast to the velocity , vorticity preserves galilean invariance and has stronger topological properties owned to helmholtz and kelvin s theorems .",
    "numerous applications of cve can be found for periodic domains in the literature starting with homogeneous isotropic turbulence  @xcite , temporally developing mixing layers  @xcite and homogeneous shear flow with and without rotation  @xcite .    for wall - bounded flows ,",
    "the situation becomes more complex , because no - slip boundary conditions have to be taken into account .",
    "indeed , no - slip boundary conditions generate vorticity due to the viscous flow interactions with the walls . for turbulent boundary layers , khujadze _",
    "et al_.  @xcite obtained an efficient algorithm to extract coherent vorticity , constructing a locally refined grid using wavelets with mirror boundary conditions .",
    "however , this construction does not yield a multiresolution analysis where the basis functions are no more isotropic .",
    "frhlich & uhlmann  @xcite constructed wavelets based on second kind chebyshev polynomials and applied them to channel flow data .",
    "scale - wise statistics in the wall - normal directions have thus been performed .",
    "however , no fast wavelet transform ( fwt ) is available for these chebyshev wavelet bases .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) wavelets have also been applied to wall - parallel planes in channel flows , in order to examine turbulent statistics , in particular statistics of energy transfer  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to examine the role of coherent and incoherent flow contributions in 3d turbulent channel flow .",
    "we propose a novel construction of 3d isotropic orthogonal wavelets using boundary wavelets in the wall - normal direction and periodic wavelets in the wall - parallel directions . to this end ,",
    "cohen - daubechies - jawerth - vial ( cdjv ) boundary wavelets  @xcite having three vanishing moments , and the periodized coiflet 30 wavelets  @xcite having ten vanishing moments are employed .",
    "these wavelets are orthogonal , the fwt can be used while taking into account boundary conditions , and the basis yields a multiresolution analysis .",
    "hence , the basis functions are isotropic since they have only one scale in all three spatial directions .    dns computation of the channel flow has been performed , and the data are analyzed at different time instants , using the above boundary adapted 3d isotropic wavelets .",
    "the flow vorticity is decomposed into an orthogonal wavelet series , and we apply a thresholding to split the coefficients into two sets , the coherent and incoherent ones .",
    "the coherent vorticity , reconstructed from the few strongest wavelet coefficients , well preserves the turbulent statistics of the total flow , while the incoherent vorticity , reconstructed from the remaining large majority of the coefficients that are very weak , corresponds to a noise - like background flow .",
    "the corresponding coherent and incoherent velocity fields are reconstructed from the coherent and incoherent vorticity fields , respectively , using the biot - savart relation satisfying the no - slip conditions at the walls .",
    "thus , we can efficiently examine the role of coherent vorticity in turbulent channel flow .",
    "other conventional methods , such as the @xmath2-criterion and the @xmath3 method  @xcite could be used to identify coherent vortices in physical space , as regions for which @xmath2 or @xmath3 is above a given threshold . here , @xmath2 is the second - invariant of the 3d velocity gradient tensor , and @xmath3 is the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the symmetric and antisymmetric tensor of the velocity gradient tensor",
    ". it should be noticed that these quantities do not preserve the scale information about the vortices , as the smoothness of the flow field is not preserved due to the clipping of vorticity in physical space .",
    "in contrast , the proposed wavelet filtering does preserve the smoothness of the coherent vorticity field and the multiscale properties of the coherent structures .",
