    "massive enough stars at the final stage of their evolution , produce the so - called supernovae explosion whose remnant is a neutron star or a black hole . because all the nuclear fuel has been exhausted in fusion reactions during the lifetime of the progenitor star , the neutron star can not compensate the gravitational pressure by burning light elements into heavier ones .",
    "therefore , as there is no nuclear reaction equilibrating the gravitational pressure , the stability has to be ensured via the stiffness of the nuclear strong interaction when the baryonic matter is compressed to extreme densities by gravity .",
    "this new type of equilibrium leaves formidable imprints on the neutron star as compared to an average star .",
    "for instance , a typical neutron star with a mass like our sun has a radius of about only @xmath0 km , _",
    "i.e. _ , almost five orders of magnitude smaller than the radius of the sun .",
    "table  [ nsprop ] collects some typical values for a few properties of a neutron star . owing to the huge densities and pressures present in these neutron - rich celestial bodies",
    ", the study of neutron stars requires a deep knowledge of the structure of matter under extreme conditions of density and isospin asymmetry  @xcite .    .",
    "properties of a typical 1 solar - mass neutron star . here",
    "@xmath1 is the radius , @xmath2 is the mean density , @xmath3 is the escape velocity , @xmath4 is the speed of light , @xmath5 is the acceleration of gravity and @xmath6 is the pressure . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we studied the structure and composition of the outer crust of a nonaccreting neutron star focusing on the effects of the current uncertainties in the nuclear symmetry energy and its density derivative on the crustal properties . for that , we followed the seminal work by baym , pethick , and sutherland , as well as the more recent comprehensive work by ruester , hempel , and schaffner - bielich . in our investigations ,",
    "six different models were adopted .",
    "two of these models , moller - nix and duflo - zuker , are based on a combined microscopic / macroscopic approach and yield the most accurate nuclear masses available in the literature .",
    "the other four models are of a purely microscopic nature .",
    "they are based on relativistic ( nl3 and fsugold ) and nonrelativistic ( skyrme sly4 and gogny d1s ) mean - field approaches .",
    "although the microscopic / macroscopic models are significantly more accurate than the mean - field models in the description of nuclear masses , microscopic models have the advantage of making definite predictions on how the symmetry energy changes with density ( see figs .",
    "[ fig05 ] and  [ fig06 ] ) .",
    "the composition and equation of state of the outer crust emerge from a competition among the nuclear , electronic , and lattice contributions to the energy , pressure and chemical potential of the system .",
    "the nuclear contribution is independent of the density of the system and , therefore , does not contribute to the total pressure ; it appears exclusively in the form of nuclear masses .",
    "the electronic contribution is modeled as a zero - temperature free fermi gas and dominates the behavior of the system with baryon density .",
    "finally , the lattice contribution which also depends on the density , provides a modest correction , less than a 10% , to the total energy of the system .",
    "hence , the competition between the different terms is basically driven by the energy of the electron fermi gas and the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the former favors a small electron fraction and , to preserve charge neutrality , a small proton fraction which leads the system toward more and more neutron - rich nuclei in the crust .",
    "the nuclear symmetry energy opposes such a change by driving the system to a more symmetric configuration in terms of the neutron and proton numbers .    for a better understanding of the competition between the electron contribution and the nuclear symmetry energy",
    ", we implemented a `` toy model '' of the outer crust by using a simple semi - empirical ( _ `` bethe - weizscker '' _ ) nuclear mass formula .",
    "volume , surface , coulomb , and asymmetry terms were extracted from a least - squares fit to 2049 nuclei .",
    "such a simple model provided us with useful insights thanks to the analytic structure of the results .",
    "indeed , a particularly transparent result was obtained that illustrates nicely the role of the electronic contribution and the nuclear symmetry energy in deciding the proton fraction : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the zero - density proton fraction , @xmath9 is the electronic fermi momentum and @xmath10 is the symmetry energy coefficient of the liquid - drop mass formula .",
    "while illuminating , this ( first - order ) result is also surprisingly accurate , as the electronic fermi momentum at the base of the outer crust is very close in value to the symmetry energy coefficient ( @xmath11  mev _ vs _ @xmath12  mev ) . in particular , the toy model predicts a value for the electron fraction at the base of the crust that differs by only a few percent from that of the drip - line nucleus @xmath13kr .    how the symmetry energy coefficient @xmath10 is modified as nuclei move far away from the line of stability is not known .",
    "likely , the symmetry energy is reduced in neutron - drip nuclei due to the development of a dilute neutron skin .",
    "mean field models of nuclear structure predict that the size of the neutron skin of neutron - rich nuclei is strongly correlated with the slope @xmath14 of the symmetry energy .",
    "the stiffer the symmetry energy , i.e. , the larger the @xmath14 parameter , the thicker the neutron skin .",
    "to investigate the sensitivity of the structure and composition of the outer crust to the density dependence of the symmetry energy , we employed relativistic ( nl3 and fsugold ) and nonrelativistic ( sly4 and d1s ) mean - field models .",
    "although these models have been accurately calibrated for the description of masses , charge radii , and other important ground - state properties , they predict a significantly different density dependence for the symmetry energy .",
    "most of the relativistic models predict larger values of the symmetry energy at saturation than the nonrelativistic ones .",
    "it is also quite common that those mean - field models show an opposite trend at subsaturation densities .",
    "that is , those models with a stiffer symmetry energy at saturation predict smaller values of the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities ( see figs .",
    "[ fig05 ] and  [ fig06 ] ) .",
    "one of the main goals of the present chapter was to document how such differences impact on the composition of the outer crust .",
    "quite generally , we show that the first substantial change to the ground - state configuration of the nuclei composing the lattice at very low densities corresponds to a jump of the neutron number that remains fixed at the magic number @xmath15 for a wide range of densities . at the same densities",
    ", the proton fraction also suffers a jump and , then , decreases systematically in an effort to reduce the electronic contribution to the chemical potential .",
    "eventually , the proton fraction becomes too low and the penalty caused by the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities drives the system into the next plateau at the magic number @xmath16 which remains fixed until the outer - inner crust interface is reached .",
    "how low can the proton fraction get and , consequently , how exotic is the composition of the crust is , then , a question that must be answered by the symmetry energy : its accurate determination remains as one of the most outstanding problems in nuclear physics nowadays . indeed , whereas nl3 predicts the formation of @xmath17ni@xmath18 , fsugold ( having a larger symmetry energy ) leaves the @xmath15 plateau with the formation of @xmath19ge@xmath18 ( or four protons earlier ) ; similar conclusions could be drawn from the study of the nonrelativistic models sly4 and d1s .",
    "this result may be stated in the form of a correlation between the neutron radius of @xmath20pb and the composition of the outer crust : _ the larger the neutron skin of @xmath20pb , the more exotic the composition of the outer crust_. finally , and as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have computed crustal properties using two of the most accurate tables of nuclear masses available today , namely , those of moller - nix and duflo - zuker .",
    "our results using the model of moller and nix agree well with those published in ref .",
    "these results are practically indistinguishable from the ones obtained using the duflo - zuker nuclear mass table ; a table that includes 9210 nuclei !",
    "both calculations served us as a reference and test of the formalism used for our study of the outer crust of a nonaccreting neutron star .    with the advent of new rare ion - beam facilities ,",
    "the experimental study of exotic nuclei will be increasingly feasible in laboratories worldwide .",
    "this promising scenario , together with the recent and , hopefully , future observations of crustal modes in magnetars , and perhaps the detection of gravitational waves from oscillating neutron stars , will likely provide us with more stringent limits on the equation of state of neutron - rich matter and will contribute to a better understanding of the outer crust of neutron stars .",
