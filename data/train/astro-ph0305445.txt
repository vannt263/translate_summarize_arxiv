    "globular clusters have proven to be an excellent place to study accreting binary systems , due to their known distances , ages , and reddening which allow system parameters and histories to be better understood than in the field .",
    "it has long been suspected that globular clusters may also provide unique channels for the formation of accreting binaries , starting with the discovery that low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are @xmath5 more common ( per unit mass ) in globular clusters than in the field ( clark 1975 ; katz 1975 ) .",
    "it is now thought that x - ray binary systems in dense globular clusters are created principally through exchange interactions between primordial binaries and other stars ( see , e.g. hut , murphy & verbunt 1991 ) .",
    "therefore , studying accreting binary systems in globular clusters can give us insight into the characteristics of accreting binary systems and populations , and also into dynamical effects inside globular clusters .    the giant leap forward in sensitivity and resolution offered by the  x - ray observatory , especially when combined with the unparalleled resolution of the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( ) , has revolutionized our understanding of globular clusters .",
    "prior to , there were 12 bright cluster lmxbs ( now 13 , all thought to have neutron stars [ ns ] as primaries ) , and 57 faint x - ray sources known in the galactic globular cluster system ( verbunt 2001 ) .",
    "a few of the latter had been identified with cataclysmic variables ( cvs ; hertz & grindlay 1983 , cool et al .",
    "1995 , grindlay et al .",
    "1995 ) , and some were thought to be lmxbs in quiescence ( qlmxbs ; verbunt , elson & van paradijs 1984 ) , but their properties were poorly understood due to the poor spatial and/or spectral resolution of previous x - ray observatories .  has identified more than 100 x - ray sources in the globular cluster 47 tuc alone ( grindlay et al . 2001a , hereafter ghe01a ) .",

    "2002b ) or with abs ( ferraro et al . 2001 , but cf .",

    "however , qlmxbs show clear differences from all other types of globular cluster x - ray sources in their colors and luminosities ( @xmath7 ergs s@xmath1 , with soft x - ray colors ) and detailed spectra ( a thermal component with implied radius of a few km , sometimes accompanied by a nonthermal harder component ) .",
    "their x - ray emission is thought to be due principally to thermal emission from the neutron star surface ( brown , bildsten , & rutledge 1998 ; campana et al .",
    "1998 ) , thus making their x - ray signatures more homogeneous than x - rays from other source types .",
    "these differences make it practical to identify a homogeneous sample of qlmxbs in different globular clusters without the need for deep   or radio datasets , using x - ray spectra , colors , and luminosities alone , as for instance in 47 tuc ( ghe01a ) , @xmath6 cen ( rutledge et al .",

    "we perform several analyses of the qlmxb population that has been uncovered in numerous globular clusters .",
    "the qlmxb population in globular clusters offers hope for understanding many questions related to neutron stars , accretion flows , and cluster dynamics . among these questions",
    ": what is the source of the x - ray luminosity observed from qlmxbs , deep crustal heating ( brown et al . 1998 ) or continued low - level accretion ?",
    "what is the nature and origin of the nonthermal hard component observed in many qlmxb spectra ?",
    "how long are qlmxbs in quiescence between outbursts ?",
    "are qlmxbs part of the progenitor population of msps ?",
    "can we constrain the radius and/or mass of qlmxbs through observation of the thermal component of their spectra ? what are the parameters of globular clusters that cause the formation of qlmxbs ? can their numbers be fully explained through two - body or single - binary encounter rates ?",
    "are other globular cluster x - ray sources ( such as cvs ) formed in the same way ?",
    "we will gather evidence to begin answering these questions in this paper .    in  2 we identify a sample of confirmed and potential qlmxbs containing neutron stars in several globular clusters , and analyze their x - ray spectra . in ",
    "3.1 we study the qlmxb radial distributions in king - model clusters . in ",
    "3.2 we analyze the qlmxb ( and harder sources ) luminosity functions , while in  3.3 we analyze the dependencies of qlmxb and harder source numbers upon cluster structural parameters . in ",

    "identifying the nature of x - ray sources is often difficult , requiring deep multiwavelength data .",
    "the unique x - ray spectral signature of a qlmxb , however , offers the possibility of identifying qlmxbs without multiwavelength followup ( important since they can be extremely optically faint ; see edmonds et al .",

    "1998 for a review . )",
    "their quiescent spectra show a thermal component roughly consistent with a 10 km neutron star ( when hydrogen atmospheres are taken into account , e.g. brown et al .",
    "in addition , a harder component parametrized as a power - law of photon index 1 to 2 is often seen , comprising up to 40% of the 0.5 - 10 kev emission ( campana et al .",
    "1998 ; rutledge et al .",
    "2002b and refs therein ) .",
    "their minimum x - ray ( 0.5 - 2.5 kev ) luminosity appears to range between @xmath8 and a few @xmath9 ergs s@xmath1 , although distances and thus luminosities are uncertain . comparison with field systems has thus allowed numerous qlmxbs to be identified in x - ray studies of globular clusters ( see below ) .",
    "the large sample of qlmxbs now known in several globular clusters allows significant comparative study .",
    "the known distances and reddening to globular clusters allows accurate luminosities to be derived , generally impossible in the field .",
    "we can fit the spectra to look for a hard power - law component as seen in some field qlmxbs , and to check for consistency with a 10 km , 1.4 @xmath3neutron star explanation .",
    "calibration changes since the publication of some early papers makes revisiting the spectral analysis on several clusters desirable , while a common standard for identifying qlmxbs would also be useful . for all analysis in this paper ,",
    "we use photoelectric absorption x - ray cross - sections of balucinska - church & mccammon ( 1992 ) in the xspec _ phabs _ model .    for this paper",
    "we choose to identify a `` canonical '' qlmxb signature , spectral consistency with a nonmagnetic hydrogen atmosphere of implied radius @xmath1010 km , with a small ( @xmath11% of 0.5 - 10 kev flux ) contribution from a power - law component allowed .",
    "this is chosen to match qlmxb systems studied in the field ( cen x-4 , rutledge et al .",

    "a notable exception to this signature is the millisecond x - ray pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( sax j1808 ) , which has shown an extremely faint ( @xmath12(0.5 - 10 kev)@xmath13 erg s@xmath1 ) quiescent spectrum in a recent xmm observation dominated by a hard ( photon index @xmath14 ) power - law component ( campana et al .",
    "we would not be able to distinguish such an object from cvs with similar spectra in globular clusters .",

    "one hard x - ray source at the upper end of this luminosity range has been identified as a bright msp in the globular cluster m28 ( becker et al .",
    "2003 ) , while a moderately hard source in 47 tuc with an unusual spectrum and strong variability has been suggested as a qlmxb ( x10 ; ghe01a , edmonds et al .",
    "transient black holes in quiescence have x - ray spectra and luminosities indistinguishable from those of cvs , although none have yet been positively identified in a globular cluster .",
    "the great majority of these hard objects are probably cvs , as we show below .",
    "cvs , composed of a ( usually low - mass main - sequence ) secondary , a white dwarf , and an accretion disk , display several optical signatures . in @xmath16 vs. @xmath17 cmds",
    "they appear bluer than the main sequence , usually lying between the main sequence and the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "a strong contributor to this blue color , the accretion disk , will also generate h-@xmath18 emission , and cause short - timescale nonperiodic variability ( flickering ) and sometimes large - amplitude outbursts . in @xmath19 vs. @xmath20 cmds , cvs generally appear redder due to the increased contribution of the secondary light , and in globular clusters have often been observed to fall on or near the main sequence ( edmonds et al 2003a ) .",
    "the secondary , filling its roche lobe , will often show ellipsoidal variations , and this periodic , low amplitude signal is detectable if the noise from flickering is not too large .",
    "the x - ray to optical flux ratio for cvs should be smaller than for qlmxbs , and a cv at a given x - ray luminosity will display much bluer colors than a qlmxb at the same luminosity , since it must be accreting at a much higher rate .",
    "based on these characteristics , x - ray sources can be identified as cvs with high confidence .",
    "detailed searches for variability and/or h-@xmath18 excess among blue counterparts to  x - ray sources have been published for three clusters , ngc 6397 , ngc 6752 , and 47 tuc .",

    "we note that the larger number is a factor of a few less than the disc stability criterion for systems of periods similar to x5 ( 8 hours ) in 47 tuc ( king 2003 ) .",
    "significantly larger mass transfer rates would cause persistent emission instead of transient behavior .",
    "taking these rates at face value , two explanations are plausible .",
    "part of this range of mass transfer rates might be supplied by initially evolved secondaries , i.e. originally intermediate - mass x - ray binaries , as suggested to predominate by recent work ( pfahl et al .",
    "alternatively , extremely old post - minimum systems will naturally generate low mass - transfer rates below @xmath96 @xmath3year@xmath1 ( king 2000 ) . in this picture , the lower luminosity limit is attributed to the finite age of the systems , less than a hubble time ( l. bildsten , 2003 , priv .",
    "we note that this luminosity range can be taken as support for the brown et al .",
    "( 1998 ) deep crustal heating model .",
    "an even lower thermal luminosity has been observed from the ( low mass - transfer , @xmath97 @xmath3year@xmath1 ) millisecond x - ray pulsar sax j1808 , and has been taken to imply enhanced neutrino cooling from the core ( campana et al .",
    "if such enhanced cooling is common among globular cluster qlmxb systems , the time - averaged mass transfer rates may be higher than we have calculated .",
    "several methods of production of globular cluster binary x - ray sources have been suggested .",
    "normal evolution from primordial binaries is not a reasonable explanation for neutron star systems ( clark 1975 ) , but may be able to explain some cvs and abs ( verbunt & meylan 1988 , davies 1997 ) .",
    "the numbers of such systems would depend upon the initial mass of the cluster and the primordial binary fraction , and would be suppressed by the destruction of wide binaries in close encounters ( davies 1997 ) .",
    "tidal capture of main - sequence stars by neutron stars or white dwarfs may generate large numbers of short - period systems ( e.g. di stefano & rappaport 1994 ) , while exchange encounters will tend to inject neutron stars into longer - period primordial binaries ( e.g. hut , murphy & verbunt 1991 ) .",
    "both of the latter mechanisms predict a rate of formation of neutron star binaries @xmath82 proportional to @xmath98 , where @xmath85 is the central luminosity density , @xmath48 is the core radius , and @xmath61 the central velocity dispersion ( verbunt & hut 1987 , verbunt 2003 ) .",
    "this assumes that the mass - to - light ratio is similar in the cores of different globular clusters , and that most of the encounters happen within the core .",
    "the second assumption is a good approximation for king - model clusters due to the steep density decline outside the core , but is less accurate for core - collapsed clusters with a less steep decline outside the core . a more accurate calculation , as performed in pooley et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , integrates the density distribution out to large radii , using the best surface profiles available .",
    "our method does allow us , however , to investigate the dependence of x - ray source formation on core density and core size separately .",
    "our simple method does not account for increased neutron star density in the core due to mass segregation ( verbunt & meylan 1988 ) , or for escape of neutron stars from globular cluster potential wells of different depth ( see pfahl et al .",
    "it also carries the potential for significant bias in that we only analyze a small sample of clusters , generally selected because of the existence of known x - ray sources and perhaps not representative of the general globular cluster system . with these caveats ,",
    "we proceed .",
    "our test of the distribution of globular cluster neutron star systems in figure 3 indeed shows compatibility with @xmath99 , as predicted by either tidal capture or exchange encounters .",
    "this result agrees with the results of verbunt & hut ( 1987 ) on bright cluster lmxbs and the simpler tests of gendre et al .",
    "( 2003b ) and pooley et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) upon qlmxbs in globular clusters .",
    "we note that this result is also compatible with the results of johnston , kulkarni & phinney ( 1992 ) on recycled pulsars ( the products of accreting neutron star systems ) and those of johnston & verbunt ( 1996 ) on globular cluster low - luminosity x - ray sources ( the brightest of which are predominantly qlmxbs ) when their neglect of the velocity dispersion @xmath100 is considered ( as noted in verbunt 2003 ) .",
    "grindlay ( 1996 ) , using measured velocity dispersions , indeed showed correlation of dim source numbers with the theoretical scaling .",
    "for the harder sources ( predominantly cvs ) , we do not find agreement with the theoretically predicted formation rate from close encounters .",
    "figures 4 , 5 , and 6 show a weaker dependence upon the central density for hard sources than for qlmxbs .",
    "the density dependence of the hard sources is better fit by @xmath101 with @xmath1021.11.3 , rather than @xmath1021.5 as for qlmxbs .",
    "one suggestion for the lower density dependence is that high density environments destroy cvs preferentially , possibly by encounters with neutron stars ( e.g. pooley et al .",
    "2002b , verbunt 2003 ) , especially during the core collapse process .",
    "ngc 6397 , the densest globular cluster yet studied , has an apparent excess of x - ray sources ( table 1 , and pooley et al .",
    "2003b ) , which suggests the opposite conclusion .",
    "however , ngc 6397 may be unusual for other reasons ; see  4.4 .    the formation of some cvs in globular clusters from primordial , undisturbed binaries ( especially in massive , moderately dense clusters like @xmath6 cen ; davies 1997 , verbunt 2003 ) may partially explain the weaker dependence upon density .",
    "many sources outside the half - mass radius of @xmath6 cen may be cvs , two of them brighter than @xmath103 ergs s@xmath1 ( cool et al .",
    "2002 , gendre et al .",
    "davies ( 1997 ) indeed predicts that cvs from primordial binaries should exist in the outer regions of this unrelaxed globular cluster .",
    "however , even if four bright primordial cvs exist in @xmath6 cen , the masses of the other globular clusters in table 1 are so much smaller that most of their bright cvs must not be primordial .",
    "according to pryor & meylan ( 1993 ) , @xmath6 cen is as massive as all the other globular clusters with bright cvs ( except ter 5 and ngc 6440 ) put together .",
    "these other clusters have 21 bright cvs , which shows that the majority of these cvs are not primordial .",
    "our analysis of x - ray source distributions is consistent with x - ray imaging studies of some dense high-@xmath82 clusters ( liller 1 , homer et al .",
    "2001 ; m15 , hannikainen et al . 2003 ) which suggest numerous x - ray sources in the luminosity range of qlmxbs . however ,",
    "several clusters with low predicted collision rates seem to have more x - ray sources than expected based on their structural parameters ; besides ngc 6397 , these include ngc 6712 , ngc 288 , ngc 6652 , and terzan 1 .",
    "other dynamical processes may be at work in these clusters .",
    "analysis of the core - collapse process suggests that binaries in the core release energy to passing stars by `` hardening '' into tighter orbits , thus slowing the collapse process before their ultimate ejection or merger ( hut et al .",
    "1992 , fregeau et al .",
    "the hardening of binaries during core collapse might be expected to generate increased mass transfer rates and thus x - ray emission . as",
    "core collapse proceeds , main - sequence binaries will be destroyed , but neutron stars should be preferentially exchanged into binaries .",
    "the numbers of each kind of x - ray binary existing at any one time may thus be a function of the cluster dynamical history , as well as current structure .",
    "differences in dynamical history may explain the unusually large numbers of cvs ( and ns systems ? ) in ngc 6397 ( see table 1 ) , compared to the similar core - collapsed globular clusters m30 and ngc 6544 .",
    "the latter , while not yet surveyed by , has a rosat upper limit of @xmath104 ergs s@xmath1 ( verbunt 2001 ) above which 5 sources exist in ngc 6397 .",
    "ngc 6397 has recently been shown to be depleted in binaries compared to several other clusters ( cool & bolton 2002 ) , while it appears to have an abundance of x - ray sources .",
    "ngc 6397 also seems to show an unusually flat cv lf , compared to 47 tuc and other clusters in general (  3.2 , and pooley et al .",
    "2002b ) .    the cluster ngc 6712 ( which contains a bright persistent ultracompact lmxb ) shows evidence for multiple accreting binaries and blue stragglers despite its relatively low density and @xmath82 ( ferraro et al .",
    "2000 , paltrinieri et al . 2001 ; @xmath105 ) .",
    "the path of ngc 6712 s orbit through the galactic bulge suggests that it experiences strong tidal stripping from the galactic potential ( dauphole et al .",
    "ngc 6712 s declining mass function below the turnoff ( de marchi et al .",
    "1999 , andreuzzi et al .",
    "2001 ) gives strong evidence that it has been stripped of @xmath106% of its initial mass ( takahashi & portegies zwart 2000 ) .",
    "an analysis of the orbits and structure of 38 globular clusters by dinescu , girard & van altena ( 1999 ) indicates that ngc 6712 , ngc 6397 , ngc 6121 , ngc 288 , palomar 5 , and possibly m80 have very high destruction rates .",
    "ferraro et al . ( 2000 ) thus suggest that ngc 6712 is only the fossil remnant core of a once very massive cluster , heavily enriched in compact objects and binaries due to mass segregation . disrupting globular clusters",
    "should be generally marked by an apparent excess of massive stars , binaries , and binary products ( such as x - ray sources or blue stragglers ) , which will remain segregated in the core while the outer halo is stripped .",
    "this destruction process should deposit x - ray binaries from globular clusters into the galactic bulge ( grindlay 1985 ) .",
    "ngc 6652 and terzan 1 each possess a bright lmxb , although their collision rates are very low ( @xmath107 and 0.008 respectively ) .",
    "in addition , they are home to at least three and one additional x - ray sources above @xmath108 ergs s@xmath1 , respectively ( heinke et al . 2001 ; wijnands et al .",
    "the orbits of ngc 6652 and terzan 1 have not yet been calculated , but idiart et al .",
    "( 2002 ) note that terzan 1 seems to have captured metal - rich stars from the bulge , implying it was once much more massive .",
    "two of ngc 6652 s x - ray sources , both probable neutron star systems , are well outside the core ( heinke et al .",
    "although ngc 6652 does not show signs of core collapse , this implies an unusual dynamical state .",
    "analysis of archival  images to measure the stellar lf and surface profile of ngc 6652 could test this .",
    "ngc 6652 and terzan 1 could be remnant cores of initially much more massive globular clusters on their way to destruction .",
    "several of the other high - destruction clusters show low - mass star depletion ( ngc 6121 , kanatas et al .",
    "1995 ; ngc 288 , bellazzini et al .",
    "2002b ; ngc 6397 , piotto , cool & king 1997 ) .",
    "palomar 5 shows both low - mass star depletion ( grillmair & smith 2001 ) and tidal tails ( odenkirchen et al . 2001 ) .",
    "these facts suggest that cluster destruction processes may have concentrated these clusters x - ray populations as well , although not as severely as ngc 6712 .",
    "such processes have recently been suggested by pooley et al .",
    "( 2003b ) to explain the apparent excess of x - ray sources in ngc 6397 .",
    "disentangling the effects of cluster destruction and core collapse on binary production will probably require significant theoretical work .",
    "the very loose cluster ngc 288 has an x - ray source with @xmath109 from rosat hri data ( verbunt 2001 ) , even though it is very poor with @xmath82=0.005 .",
    "ngc 288 shows centrally concentrated binary stars and blue stragglers ( bellazzini et al . 2002a ; ferraro et al .",
    "however , bellazzini et al . ( 2002a ) think that it would be very difficult to re - expand ngc 288 to its current low density after compressing the core sufficiently to produce collisional products .",
    "they and ferraro et al .",
    "( 2003 ) instead suggest that ngc 288 s large numbers of blue stragglers are the result of primordial binary evolution , like the halo blue stragglers in m3 ( ferraro et al .",
    "1997 ) , and may be due to an initially high binary fraction .",
    "the high destruction rate of ngc 288 suggests that its binary fraction may be enhanced by the removal of lower - mass single stars from the halo during its repeated disk shocks .",
    "it will be of great interest to see if the same processes that generate large numbers of blue stragglers in ngc 288 also produce numerous x - ray sources detectable in recent  observations ( principal investigator : w.  g.  h. lewin ) .",
    "metallicity has been suggested to have an effect on the luminosity of extragalactic globular cluster x - ray sources ( e.g. kundu , maccarone , & zepf 2002 ) .",
    "this metallicity effect may be due to differences in cluster initial mass functions ( grindlay 1993 ) or to the larger radii of metal - rich stars increasing both tidal capture and roche - lobe overflow rates ( bellazzini et al .",
    "more massive clusters should be better able to retain neutron stars after their formation kicks ( pfahl et al .",
    "2002 ) , which will affect the numbers of msps as well as qlmxbs .",
    "neither mass nor metallicity have obvious effects upon the galactic globular clusters studied here .",
    "analyzing the effects of all the above factors on the various globular cluster populations will require deep observations of a number of clusters with very different parameters , paired with deep radio and optical datasets to clearly identify different source types below the luminosities discussed here .",
    "we have created a catalog of known qlmxbs containing neutron stars in globular clusters , adding three probable qlmxbs in ngc 6440 to those already known .",
    "we have reanalyzed those qlmxbs in archived globular cluster observations using the hydrogen atmosphere models of lloyd ( 2003 ) , and find general consistency with 10 km radii .",
    "the hard power - law component required in the spectra of many field qlmxbs is absent in most globular cluster qlmxbs , with the notable exception of the recently active transient in ngc 6440 .",
    "the radial distribution of these qlmxbs within their globular clusters is consistent with a mass of 1.5@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "this is as expected for accreting neutron star systems , and suggests that the neutron stars do not grow significantly in mass .",
    "globular cluster qlmxbs range in luminosity from @xmath4 ergs s@xmath1 up to a few @xmath9 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "quiescent lmxbs below @xmath4 ergs s@xmath1 would have been identifiable in most clusters , so the cutoff implies a lower limit to the time - averaged mass accretion rate .",
    "this range of luminosities is consistent with the brown et al .",
    "( 1998 ) model for qlmxb emission , as higher mass transfer rates would lead to persistent systems and significantly lower rates would probably require systems older than a hubble time .",
    "the luminosity function of globular cluster qlmxbs is consistent with the lf of globular cluster sources analyzed by johnston & verbunt ( 1996 ) , which is not surprising as they are usually the brightest sources in a cluster .",
    "the lfs of harder sources above @xmath15 ergs s@xmath1 , which are mostly cvs , appear to vary between clusters , suggesting an influence of metallicity or core collapse upon cv properties .",
    "the numbers of qlmxbs in different clusters are consistent with the relative numbers of close encounters , allowing either tidal capture or exchange encounters as a mode of production .",
    "this suggests that the total number of accreting neutron stars in globular clusters is near 100 .",
    "the harder sources , however , show a lesser dependence upon density , suggesting that dense environments may tend to destroy cvs . the core collapse process could be responsible for differences in the numbers and types of x - ray binaries between ngc 6397 and similar clusters .",
    "tidal destruction or evaporation of clusters may leave substantial numbers of x - ray sources in apparently poor clusters .",
    "this study has begun to probe individual source populations across different globular clusters , and test the effects of varying central density and core radius upon the properties of two populations , qlmxbs and cvs .",
    "future  observations will allow us to test the effects of metallicity , cluster mass , and other dynamical processes in clusters .",
    "deep optical and radio datasets are also allowing identification and study of populations of abs and msps .",

    "<S> we identify an empirical lower luminosity limit of @xmath4 ergs s@xmath1 among globular cluster qlmxbs . </S>",
    "<S> the bolometric luminosity range of qlmxbs implies ( in the deep crustal heating model of brown and collaborators ) low time - averaged mass transfer rates , below the disk stability criterion . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray luminosity functions of the cv populations alone in ngc 6397 and 47 tuc are shown to differ . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of qlmxbs among globular clusters is consistent with their dynamical formation by either tidal capture or exchange encounters , allowing us to estimate that seven times more qlmxbs than bright lmxbs reside in globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of harder sources ( primarily cvs ) has a weaker dependence upon density than that of the qlmxbs . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss possible effects of core collapse and globular cluster destruction upon x - ray source populations . </S>"
