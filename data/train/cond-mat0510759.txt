    "the largest challenge in developing a meaningful theory of plasticity is often linking the microscopic behavior of individual , discrete dislocations to the macroscopic plastic behavior of the system . in atomic and molecular crystals for example , understanding the effect of dislocations on mesoscopic and macroscopic material properties involves the treatment of length and time scales that capture the relevant dynamics of individual dislocations ( @xmath0@xmath1,@xmath0@xmath2 ) through those that describe the macroscopic response of the material ( @xmath0@xmath3,@xmath0@xmath4 ) . an important approach to the problem of spanning this large range of scales has been to measure the dynamics of individual dislocations and/or small numbers of interacting dislocations on the shortest time scales from molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite .",
    "these results are then used as input into coarse - grained , mesoscopic simulations such as dislocation dynamics ( dd ) @xcite , which can provide information on systems with large numbers of dislocations under the action of experimentally accessible strains and strain rates .",

    "a slight increase with @xmath58 was noted , and is linked to the time required for the strain applied at the edges to diffuse inward to the dislocation core .",

    "[ peivrate ] .",
    "note that if @xmath68 is negligible , then clearly this effect will not be noticeable , but since the dynamics are necessicarily diffusive in these simulations , it is reasonable to expect some contribution from this effect .",
    "[ [ section-24 ] ]    accurate fits to the rigid displacement data were more difficult to obtain , most likely due to the transition to no @xmath54 dependence for large @xmath54 .",
    "this can be shown by studying the evolution of @xmath51 under an applied shear . in @xcite ,",
    "the change in @xmath51 for a one - mode approximate hexagonal solution under the action of shear was be found by minimizing @xmath51 when @xmath14 is replaced with @xmath84 .",
    "the resulting equation , valid for small @xmath45 , is @xmath85 in principle , this represents a rigid displacement of @xmath14 at infinitely large @xmath54 . in this limit",
    ", @xmath52 has no explicit dependence on @xmath54 ; @xmath86    [ [ section-25 ] ]    dislocation dynamics in soft structures such as colloidal crystals are reasonably expected to correspond to the case of relaxational displacement .",
    "these systems typically exhibit very little rigidity associated with sound modes or phonons , thus their relative softness .",
    "conversely , dynamics in atomic crystals are believed to correspond to the case of rigid displacement at large @xmath54 .",
    "atomic crystals exhibit a significant rigidity in response to an applied shear , which can be reasonably approximated by a linear shear profile as is done for rigid displacement .",
    "a more constructive way to model atomic crystals would be to explicitly consider a phonon or wave term in the dynamics , as is being done by other authors @xcite . if such modes were considered , the collective motion of particles in response to an applied force would naturally be enhanced , more resembling the case of rigid displacement .",
    "it is argued in this sense that the methods of rigid displacement in the large @xmath54 region and relaxational displacement represent limiting cases of response , and that a more rigorous description including effective phonon dynamics would fall between these limits .",
    "[ [ section-26 ] ]    the nature of the dislocation motion in these simulations ( fig .  [ glide ] ) is stick - slip at low velocities with a transition to a more continuous character at high velocities .",
    "this is expected , as the lattice barrier leads to thermally activated motion when @xmath87 approximately equals @xmath88 , while at large values of @xmath87 the barrier becomes secondary and the motion assumes a damped character .",
    "the shear rate dictates the maximum velocity and therefore the extent to which the motion becomes continuous .",

    "the dislocation approaches a continuous glide motion and eventually reaches a steady - state velocity .",
    "this velocity can be calculated by equating the orowan equation @xmath95 to the applied shear rate , giving the quantity @xmath91 defined in eq .",

    "the cycle then repeats itself once enough strain is re - accumulated to overcome the barrier again .",
    "this oscillatory motion will occur whenever the velocity assumed just above the peierls barrier is greater than the theoretical @xmath91 for the system .",
    "the rate at which the dislocation glide relieves strain is temporarily greater than the applied strain rate , so the energy falls below the peierls barrier and glide is no longer possible until the strain energy again increases sufficiently .",
    "[ [ section-29 ] ]    empirically , dislocation glide velocity is described by the following equation : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the shear wave velocity , @xmath99 is the effective shear stress on the dislocation , @xmath100 is the material stress constant , and @xmath101 is the stress exponent @xcite .",
