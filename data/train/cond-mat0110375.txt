    "we find the band structures for either valence or conduction bands of carbon nanotube are not significantly changed upon the molecule adsorption .",
    "however , the degeneracies of the energy bands in swnt are removed by the molecule - tube interaction .",
    "the band splitting cause by no@xmath0 is more pronounced than that by nh@xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the larger charge transfer and the higher adsorption energy ( table ii ) .",
    "+   +    = 4.5 in    in fig.5 , we present the electronic density of states ( dos ) of individual ( 10,0 ) swnts adsorbed with no@xmath0 , nh@xmath1 , along with that of the pure swnt . except for the slight modification on dos shape due to band splitting",
    ", we find the dos of nh@xmath1 adsorbed nanotube is very close to that of pure tube .",
    "similar behavior is obtained for all charge donor molecules studied ( n@xmath0 , h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 etc . ) .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the interaction between nanotube and these gas molecules is weak and does not have significant influence on the electronic structures of swnts .    in the cases of no@xmath0 and o@xmath0 , the interaction between molecule and swnt are much more pronounced .",
    "as shown in fig.5 , the adsorption of no@xmath0 has considerably modified the shape of dos . due to existence of a half occupied molecule level near the valence band edge",
    ", the coupling between tube and molecule shift the fermi energy into the valence band and the dos at the fermi energy is high .",
    "therefore , a semiconductor swnt can be turned into @xmath8-type conductor after no@xmath0 or o@xmath0 adsorption .",

    "nmr experiment has further proved the increase of density of state at fermi level of swnts after exposure to oxygen @xcite while most other gas like h@xmath0 , co@xmath0 do not have such effect @xcite .",
    "our calculations suggest that this is probably due to the hybridization between the tube valence bands and nearby molecule level . as suggested in ref.[15 ] , the air exposure effect on the measured properties of as - prepared nanotubes should be carefully examined .",
    "many supposedly intrinsic properties measured on tube samples might be severely compromised by extrinsic air exposure effects . based on present calculations , we propose that the effects from most gas molecules in the air , such as n@xmath0 , co@xmath0 , h@xmath0o , are relatively weak .",
    "the air exposure effect should be dominated by o@xmath0 , which is charge acceptor and make all nanotubes @xmath8 type conductors .",

    "weak coupling is found between no@xmath0 and carbon nanotube .",
    "the carbon @xmath9 bonds near the molecule are weakened due to the charge transferred from carbon to no@xmath0 .",
    "we also find charge density redistribution on carbon close to the no@xmath0 molecule .",
    "therefore , we think that the molecule adsorption can induce a local charge fluctuation in the contact region of the nanotube . such fluctuation may have pronounced effect on the transport properties of metallic swnt . the charge fluctuation can act as scatting centers for conducting electrons and increase the resistance of a metallic nanotube . in a recent experiment ,",
    "it was found that the resistance of metallic tube bundle increase with gas molecules ( o@xmath0 , n@xmath0 , etc ) @xcite .",
    "we have carried out preliminary resistance calculations on the molecule induced charge fluctuations found that significant resistance increase can be detected with a single molecule adsorption .",
    "the detailed study on this subject will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have performed first principles calculations on the electronic properties of nanotube upon adsorption of gas molecules .",
    "we found that all molecules are weakly adsorbed on swnt with small charge transfer , while they can be either charge donor or accepter of nanotube .",
    "the adsorption of some gas molecules on swnts can cause significant change in electronic and transport properties of nanotube due to the charge transfer and charge fluctuation .",
