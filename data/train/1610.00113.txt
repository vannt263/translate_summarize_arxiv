    "the fractional quantum hall states assuming even - denominator landau level ( ll ) filling factor@xcite have recently come into the limelight both in the experimental@xcite and theoretical investigations@xcite due to a theoretical prediction that they are promising candidates to be useful for topological quantum computing@xcite .",
    "the use of the topological charge is constrained by the measurements , which should be able to readout the qubits .",
    "hence , interferometers are indispensable for the implementation of topological quantum computation . the topological quantum computation proposal seeks to explore quasiparticle statistics of a particular fractional quantum hall state , namely filling factor @xmath0 , which is believed to obey non - abelian statistics@xcite .",

    "recently , there have been advances in realising quantum hall edge - state based interferometers at fractional filling factors at the lowest ll@xcite .",
    "much of the attention has been focused on the filling factor @xmath0 state in quantum dots ( qds ) which consist of the two lls@xcite . for an infinite system",
    "the lowest ll is fully occupied and is spin compensated , whereas the second lowest ll is spin polarised . for a finite system ,",
    "e.g. a qd , the formation of spin droplet ( sd ) is expected , due to competition between the confinement potential and interactions . once the spin polarised electrons in the second lowest ll is localised to the centre of the qd emanating from exchange - correlation effects , they are called sd , which is a many - body phenomenon of interacting electrons@xcite .",
    "rasanen et al.@xcite show that theoretical evidence of sd formation in large ( @xmath2 ) qds at the filling factor range @xmath3 by using numerical many electron methods .",
    "their calculations indicate that the paired electron state breaks down leading to fragmentation of spin and charge densities in parabolic external confining potentials .",
    "they point out that evidence of the fragmentation can be tested by investigating the spatial dependence of the spin and charge densities in different geometries . before our previous work@xcite ,",
    "there has been no systematic investigation on the stability of sds at the filling factor range @xmath3 considering broken rotational symmetry .",
    "there it is shown that , the broken rotational symmetry does not considerably affect the stability of sd formation . however , the stability of a sd under complete break down of both the axial and the rotational symmetry of the confinement is still under debate and such an asymmetric confinement is much more realistic in investigating experimental systems . here , we perform numerical investigation of the formation of sds in a half - side etched , half - side gated qd yielding an asymmetric confining potential .     sketch of the layer sequence of gaas / algaas heterostructure , which has the dimensions of @xmath4 nm@xmath5 .",

    "in contrast to compressible region , when the fermi level is between two consequent ll , electrons do not contribute to screening locally i.e. the confining potential could not be screened perfectly .",
