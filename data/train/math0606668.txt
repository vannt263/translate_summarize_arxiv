    "( see gunawardena and keane  @xcite , where topical functions were introduced . )",
    "the max - plus case has , for instance , been applied to model queuing networks ( mairesse  @xcite , heidergott  @xcite ) , train networks ( heidergott and de  vries  @xcite and braker  @xcite ) or job - shop ( cohen , dubois , quadrat and viot  @xcite ) .",

    ".    we will focus on the asymptotic behavior of @xmath40 .",
    "it follows from theorem  [ thvincent ] , due to vincent , that @xmath41 converges to a limit  @xmath42 .    in many cases ,",
    "if the modeled system is closed , then every sequence of coordinate @xmath43 also tends to @xmath42 , by theorem  [ lgn ] .",
    "the so - called cycle time @xmath42 is the inverse of the network s throughput or the inverse of the production system s output , as in example  [ exprod ] .",
    "therefore , there have been many attempts to estimate it ( cohen  @xcite , gaujal and jean - marie  @xcite , resig et al .",
    "@xcite ) . even when the @xmath37 s are i.i.d . and",
    "take only finitely many values , approximating @xmath42 is np - hard ( blondel , gaubert and tsitsiklis  @xcite ) .",
    "hong and his coauthors have obtained @xcite analyticity of @xmath42 as a function of the law of  @xmath44 .",
    "they did so under the so - called memory loss property ( mlp ) introduced by mairesse to ensure some stability of @xmath40 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we prove another type of stability under the same assumptions .",
    "if @xmath0 has the mlp , then @xmath40 actually satisfies a central limit theorem ( clt ) under the same mixing and integrability hypotheses as the real variables in the clt for sum of stationary variables by billingsley  @xcite and ibragimov  @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , two clts have already been proved for this type of sequences : one in  @xcite and the other in  @xcite .",
    "the most obvious improvement is that both assumed that the @xmath37 s are i.i.d .",
    "moreover , in  @xcite , the hypothesis is difficult to check and the @xmath37 s are max - plus operators defined by almost surely bounded matrices . in",
    "@xcite the main hypothesis is also the mlp , but integrability hypotheses were stronger , except for a subclass of topical operators .",
    "the remainder of this article is divided into two sections . in section  [ secpres ]",
    "we define the memory loss property , present some law of large number type results and state our central limit theorems . in section  [ secproofs ] we prove the theorems .",
    "first , we state the clt for subadditive processes by ishitani  @xcite , then we check that @xmath45 satisfies each of its hypotheses . to this aim ,",
    "we use mairesse s construction of the stationary version of the srs , as well as different results from ergodic theory , depending on the hypothesis .",
    "we eventually deduce the results on @xmath40 from those on @xmath45 .",
    "dealing with homogeneous operators , it is natural to introduce the quotient space of @xmath12 by the equivalence relation @xmath46 defined by @xmath47 if @xmath48 is proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "this space will be called projective space and denoted by @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , @xmath51 will be the equivalence class of  @xmath52 .",
    "the function @xmath53 embeds @xmath50 onto a subspace of @xmath54 with dimension @xmath55 .",
    "the infinity norm of @xmath54 therefore induces a distance on @xmath50 which will be denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "a direct computation shows that @xmath57 . by a slight abuse",
    ", we will also write @xmath58 for @xmath59 . the projective norm of @xmath52 will be @xmath60 .",
    "let us recall two well - known facts about topical operators .",
    "first , a topical operator is nonexpanding with respect to the infinity norm ( crandall and tartar  @xcite ) .",
    "second , the operator it defines from @xmath50 to itself is nonexpanding for @xmath56 ( mairesse  @xcite ) .",
    "the key property for our proofs is below :    1 .   a topical operator @xmath19 is said to have rank  1",
    "if it defines a constant operator on @xmath61 does not depend on @xmath8 .",
    "a sequence @xmath0 of @xmath15-valued random variables is said to have the memory loss property ( mlp ) if there exists an @xmath62 such that @xmath63 has rank  1 with positive probability .",
    "this notion has been introduced by mairesse  @xcite , with the @xmath37 s as max - plus operators . in this case , the denomination rank  1 is natural .",
    "we have proved in  @xcite that this property is generic for i.i.d .",
    "max - plus operators : it is fulfilled when the support of the law of @xmath44 is not included in the union of finitely many affine hyperplanes , and in the discrete case the atoms of the probability measure are linearly related .",
    "this result applied to example  [ exprod ] states that the sequence @xmath0 has the mlp provided that the support of @xmath64 is not included in a union of finitely many affine hyperplanes of @xmath65 .",
    "this is not completely straightforward because the matrix @xmath66 is defined by only 5 variables , but the detailed result ( see remark  5.1 in @xcite ) shows that the linear forms on  @xmath67 that define the hyperplanes are not canceled by @xmath66 , because of the @xmath20 entries .    in  @xcite",
    ", we have proved that if the @xmath37 s are i.i.d . and the sequence has the mlp",
    ", then @xmath68 satisfies the same limit theorem as a sum of i.i.d . real variables .",
    "here we prove that it still satisfies the clt if the @xmath37 s are mixing quick enough .",
    "quick enough means that the @xmath37 s satisfy the same integrability and mixing hypothesis as the real variables in the clt for the sum of stationary variables by billingsley  @xcite and ibragimov  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this proves the clt under weaker integrability condition than in  @xcite .",
    "there have been many papers about the law of large numbers for products of random max - plus matrices since its introduction by cohen  @xcite .",
    "we can , for instance , cite baccelli @xcite , the most recent paper by bousch and mairesse  @xcite and merlet  @xcite ( in french ) .",
    "the latter article gives results for a larger class of topical operators , called uniformly topical .",
    "vincent @xcite proved a law of large number for topical operators that will do in our case .",
    "he noticed that @xmath45 [ resp .",
    "@xmath69 is subadditive ( resp .",
    "superadditive ) , which leads to the following :    [ thvincent ] let @xmath0 be a stationary ergodic sequence of topical operators and @xmath70 an @xmath12-valued random variable . if @xmath71 and @xmath70 are integrable , then there exist @xmath72 and @xmath73 in @xmath74 such that @xmath75    baccelli and mairesse give a condition to ensure @xmath76 , hence , the convergence of @xmath77 :    [ lgn]let @xmath0 be a stationary ergodic sequence of topical operators and @xmath70 an @xmath12-valued random variable such that @xmath71 and @xmath70 are integrable .",
    "if there exists an @xmath62 , such that @xmath63 has a bounded projective image with positive probability , then there exists @xmath42 in @xmath74 such that @xmath78    that being the case , @xmath42 is called the lyapunov exponent of the sequence . since matrices with rank  1 have a bounded projective image , any ergodic sequence @xmath0 with the mlp fulfills the hypotheses of theorem  [ lgn ] .",
    "let us state the definitions of mixing to be used in the sequel .",
