    "the past decade of near - ir sky surveys and technological advances in high dynamic range imaging have found a large number ( @xmath0100 ) of very low - mass ( vlm ) , ultracool objects .",
    "this has brought about spectral classification schemes ( burgasser et al . 2001 ; geballe et al .",
    "2001 ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ; martn et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , 1999b ) attempting to organize and understand them in the same way as we understand main sequence stars through the mk spectral classification scheme .",
    "however , the interpretation of physical parameters from the classification schemes is a more complicated exercise with ultracool objects as the lack of a sustained hydrogen burning core creates a degeneracy between mass and age as the luminosity fades in time .",
    "also , the spectra of these objects are significantly affected by dust in their atmospheres ( allard et al .",
    "2001 ; basri et al .",
    "2000 ; schweitzer et al .",
    "2001 ) possibly introducing a weather - like time variable phenomenon ( bailer - jones & mundt 2001 ; martn et al . 2001 ; nakajima et al .",
    "just as stellar evolution theory was calibrated using the dynamical mass estimates of binary stars , it is important to check evolutionary tracks of vlm objects using low - luminosity binaries .    in recent years",
    ", there have been surveys using the high resolution capabilities of the hst ( martn et al .",
    "1999a , 2000a ; reid et al .",
    "2001 ) and of large ground based telescopes ( close et al . 2002",
    "; koerner et al . 1999 ; martn et al .",
    "2000b ) to look for companions to the known vlm objects .",
    "one goal of these searches is to build a sample of vlm binary systems in which accurate dynamical masses can be obtained .",
    "a handful of brown dwarf binaries are known , but only gl  569b ( lane et al .",
    "2001 , kenworthy et al .",
    "2001 ) , 2massw  j0746425 + 200032 ( reid et al . 2001 ) , and 2massj 1426316 + 155701 ( close et al . 2002 ) have periods @xmath310 years .    in this paper",
    "we add to the growing list of vlm ultracool binary systems . in a companion search around nearby , young ( less than 1 gyr ) , solar - type stars selected from the sample of gaidos et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we found two companions next to the star hd  130948 .",
    " 2 overviews the observations ,  3 presents the photometric , astrometric , and spectroscopic results which confirm that the companions are truly associated with the primary star.4 discusses the placement of the objects on an hr - diagram compared with theoretical evolutionary models , and presents estimations of the age and mass of the companions .",
    "the two companions of hd  130948 were discovered using the hokupaa ( graves et al .",
    "1999 ) curvature sensing adaptive optics ( ao ) system mounted on the gemini north telescope in the wollaston prism mode ( potter et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) on the night of 2001 february 24 ( ut ) .",
    "figure  1 displays the discovery image of the companion system which is separated by 2@xmath464@xmath50@xmath401 and is 8 magnitudes fainter in the h - band relative to the primary star .. before the photometric and astrometric analysis , all images were flat - fielded with the bad pixels filtered from the images .",
    "the field of view in the wollaston prism mode is a rectangle that is 4@xmath6x20@xmath6 .",
    "three sets ( 20 exposures / set ) of 20 second exposures were obtained to give a total exposure time of 1200 seconds .",
    "each set of exposures was taken with different field orientations separated by 90@xmath7 using gemini s instrument rotator .",
    "no other stars were observed in the field .    to check for a common proper motion between the primary star and the new companions , and for possible orbital motion between the vlm binary pair ,",
    "the objects were observed on four different occasions over a time baseline of 204 days between 2001 february 24 ( ut ) and 2001 september 20 ( ut ) .",
    "the proper motion of hd 130948 is well known ( perryman et al . 1997 ) to be 148 mas / year , which equates to 4.3 pixels of relative movement between background stars and common proper motion objects on the hokupaa / quirc detector .",
    "we find there is no significant differential motion between the binary pair ( b and c ) and the primary star ( a ) within our astrometric accuracy of @xmath05 mas .",
    "therefore , the two objects are most likely a gravitationally bound pair at the same istance as the primary star ( 17.9 pc ) .",
    "the average astrometric result is a separation between hd  130948 b and c equal to @xmath8=0@xmath4134@xmath50@xmath4005 and a position angle equal to pa=317@xmath9@xmath51@xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 photometry was obtained using the mko near - ir photometric system based on the ukirt faint standard star list ( hawarden et al .",
    "the photometry was obtained on 2001 april 19 ( ut ) .",
    "the halo of the bright primary star presented an obstacle in obtaining accurate photometry of the companions . in order to subtract the profile of the halo ,",
    "each image was differenced with a version of itself , rotated about the photocenter of the primary by 180@xmath9 . after the subtraction ,",
    "the background immediately surrounding the companions was relatively flat which allowed the use of curve of growth aperature photometry on the combined light of both companions .",
    "the brightness ratio of the two companions was then estimated to be b / c=4/3 based on the profiles of the stars .",
    "the same parameters for the curve of growth method were used for the ukirt faint standard , fs137 .",
    "the absolute magnitudes based on a 17.9 pc distance and their errors are provided in table 1 .",
    "the measured colors of both objects are consistent with those of field l dwarfs ( leggett et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    ".photometry of hd  130948b and c [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     on the basis of the measurements shown in table  2 , and the visual comparison with standard spectra , we estimated that both hd  130948b and c are cooler than m9 and warmer than l5 .",
    "however , the relatively narrow spectral region covered with nirspec does not allow us to distinguish between spectral subclasses in the range l0 to l4 .",
    "thus , we adopt a spectral type of dl2 with an uncertainty of 2 spectral subclasses for both hd  130948b and c.",
    "hd  130948 is a chromospherically active single g2v star with high lithium abundance , and fast rotation ( p=7.8 days ) .",
    "all these properties are indicative of youth ( age@xmath20.8  gyr ; gaidos et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the space motions of hd  130948 suggest that it could be related to the ursa major stream ( fuhrmann 2002 , in preparation ) , which has an age of about 300  myr .",
    "the two new companions of hd  130948 are probably contracting brown dwarfs because of the young age of the primary star . with the aim of estimating their ages and masses , we placed hd  130948  b and c on an h - r diagram with theoretical evolutionary tracks shown in figure  3 .",
    "we used the evolutionary models of chabrier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that include dust in the equation of state and the opacity because those are appropiate for l dwarfs ( allard et al .",
    "basri et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and schweitzer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have estimated the effective temperatures ( t@xmath13 ) of l dwarfs using the dusty models of allard et al .",
    "leggett et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have used the same atmosphere models plus structural models for objects of known distance .",
    "we adopt t@xmath13=1950@xmath5250  k for hd  130948b and c , which includes the whole range of t@xmath13 estimates for l0l4 dwarfs in the literature .",
    "our nirspec data alone are not sufficient to tell whether hd  130948b and c have different l spectral type because the region that we observed does not contain features that are sensitive to changes in subclass in the range l0 to l4 .",
    "we note , however , that if we force hd  130948b and c to lie on the same isochrone , their spectral types should differ by about 2 subclasses .",
    "further spectroscopic observations , particularly at optical wavelengths , can test the agreement between the position of these objects in the h - r diagram and the model predictions .    for an age",
    "younger than 1  gyr ( consistent with youth of hd  130948a ) , the chabrier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) dusty models give a mass less than 0.075  m@xmath14 for hd  130948b , and less than 0.065  m@xmath14 for hd  130948c .",
    "it is very likely that both objects are young contracting brown dwarfs . for a total mass of the binary system of about 0.013  m@xmath14 , and a semimajor axis of 2.4  au",
    ", the orbital period should be @xmath010 years .",
    "follow - up observations of this binary system over the next few years will yield dynamical masses for these two l dwarfs , which will extend the mass - luminosity - spectral type relation to cooler temperatures , and will provide two well constrained calibration points for the theoretical models describing low - mass , ultracool objects .",
    "although there are a handful of brown dwarfs known as companions to main sequence stars , hd130948 b - c is the first brown dwarf binary system imaged around a g - type star .",
    "this advance has been rendered possible by the high dynamic range provided by the hokupaa ao system on the gemini - north telescope . at the time of writing this paper ,",
    "31 g - type stars less than 1gyr old have been observed with hokupaa / gemini in our ongoing survey for vlm companions to the stars in the gaidos et al .",
    "( 2000 ) sample and other nearby , young g - type stars .",
    "the survey observations are sensitive to objects 2 magnitudes fainter than the hd130948b - c objects at radii inbetween 10 au and 100 au from the stars .",
    "the detection of this new binary brown dwarf system in our survey gives a 3.2% @xmath53.2% frequency of brown dwarfs in the radius region we are sensitive to .",
    "this number is likely a lower limit because we are not sensitive to low mass brown dwarfs .",
    "gizis et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have reported a frequency of brown dwarf companions to g - type stars of 18% @xmath5 14% for separations",
    "larger than 1000 au .",
    "liu et al . (",
    "2002 ) have found an l - type companion at 14  au of a g - type star using adaptive optics . combining our result with that of gizis et al . and liu et al . , we suggest that brown dwarf companions to g - type dwarfs with separations larger than 10  au may be common .",
    "the brown dwarf desert may be restricted to separations less than 10  au .",
    "this supports the theoretical models of armitage & bonnell ( 2002 ) that explain a lack of brown dwarfs within 10  au of solar type stars as a consequence of orbital migration in circumstellar disks .",
