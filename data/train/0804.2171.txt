    "p_-type semiconducting bnnts.@xcite the role of defects and also the role of polarization field in bnnts have been reported.@xcite however , to the best of our knowledge , it is still unclear how transverse electric fields affect the electronic structures of bnnts with intrinsic defects .    in this work ,",
    "we report the first - principles studies on the electronic structures of ( 16,0 ) bnnts with antisite , carbon substitution , single vacancy , and stone - wales 5775 defects under transverse electric fields .",
    "electric fields at three different directions perpendicular to the tube axis are applied .",
    "our electronic structure calculations are performed by means of the spin polarized density - functional theory implemented in vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp).@xcite the projector augmented wave ( paw)@xcite method is used to describe the electron - ion interaction , and the cut - off energy is set to 400.0 ev .",
    "perdew - wang functional@xcite is used for the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "the total energy is converged to 10@xmath0 ev .",
    "the atomic structures are fully relaxed without electric field until the forces are less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "the optimized geometrical structures are used to calculate the electronic structures under transverse static electric fields .",
    "our test calculations on a ( 16,0 ) bnnt with b antisite indicate that geometry relaxation under electric field gives similar results .",
    "we adopt ( 16,0 ) bnnts with diameter 12.8  in our calculations .",
    "the tube axis is along the @xmath1 direction . to minimize the interaction between adjacent images , we use a large cubic supercell ( 25.000 @xmath2 25.000 @xmath2 4.349 @xmath3 ) for the pristine bnnt . for bnnts with antisite and carbon substitution defects ,",
    "we use a supercell with _ _ c__=8.698  , twice of the lattice parameter for the pristine bnnt . and for bnnts with vacancies and stone - wales defects , we use a supercell with _ _ c__=17.397  .",

    "the method of applying static electric field implemented in vasp is in the spirit of the work of neugebauer and scheffler.@xcite the electrostatic potential decreases along the direction of electric field . for convenience ,",
    "all the defects are put at the positive @xmath4 side in the supercell .",
    "the transverse electric field applied from the pristine side to the defective side is thus at the positive direction along @xmath4 axis ( @xmath5 ) . and",
    "the effects of electric fields applied at the positive @xmath6 direction ( @xmath7 ) and negative @xmath4 direction ( @xmath8 ) are also studied .",

    "the strength here is enough to induce distinct change of electronic properties of the tubes but no electron emission .",
    "it is expected that similar results should be obtained for larger bnnts under weaker electric fields .",
    "first , we examine the electronic properties of a pristine ( 16,0)bnnt under electric field . the pristine ( 16,0 ) bnnt is a semiconductor with a 4.47 ev band gap .",
    "the conduction band mainly comes from b atoms , and the valence band mainly comes from n atoms . when the electric field increases from 0.0 to 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 v /  , the band gap decreases from 4.47 ev to 4.04 , 3.52 , and finally 2.96 ev .",
    "it changes almost linearly with the increase of electric field strength , which is consistent with the work of khoo _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "the charge densities of the conduction band edge ( cbe ) states are moved along the direction of the electric field , to one side of the tube . and",
    "the valence band edge ( vbe ) states are moved to the opposite side of the nanotube .",
    "we consider seven kinds of defects on the ( 16,0 ) bnnts : boron antisite ( @xmath12 ) , nitrogen antisite ( @xmath13 ) , carbon substitution in a boron site ( @xmath14 ) or a nitrogen site ( @xmath15 ) , boron vacancy ( @xmath16 ) , nitrogen vacancy ( @xmath17 ) , and stone - wales 5775 ( sw ) .",
    "the results without electric field are presented first .",
    "the relaxed geometries are shown in fig .",
    "the formation energies presented in table  [ tform ] are calculated as @xmath18-e_{binding}[ideal\\text{-}tube ] ,   \\label{eform } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 $ ] are binding energies of systems without and with defects , respectively .",
    "the results are a little larger than those in the ( 8,0 ) bnnt .",
    "@xcite we also present work function of these bnnts in the table  [ tform ] .",
    "the band structures of the pristine and defective nanotubes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fband ] , which are similar with the previous results.@xcite the defect @xmath13 introduces only occupied defect state , @xmath16 introduces only unoccupied defect states , all the other defects introduce both unoccupied and occupied states in the band gap . in ( 16,0 ) bnnts with @xmath15 and @xmath12 , the unoccupied defect states are close to the vbe , but farther than that in the @xmath16 case . while in the tube with @xmath14 , the occupied defect states are near to the cbe .",
    "the defect states in bnnts with @xmath17 and sw are deep in the band gap .",
    "the band structures of these systems can be sketched schematically in fig .",
    "[ fdiag ] , we define the energy difference between the cbe and the vbe as @xmath21 ; the one between the lowest unoccupied defect state and the vbe as @xmath22 ; and the one between the highest occupied defect state and the cbe as @xmath23 . from table",
    "[ tgap ] , we can see that , under zero electric field , the introduction of defects does not change the @xmath21 . as for the charge densities of the defect states",
    ", they are localized near the defect sites .",
    "it is shown from the profiles of the defect state charge densities in fig .",
    "[ fchg ] . for bnnts with carbon substitution and single vacancy defects ,",
    "there are also local magnetic moments in these systems ( see table  [ tmag ] ) . for the defective ( 16,0 ) bnnts , we study the effects of the 0.3 v /  electric fields at different directions .",
    "the @xmath21 in the defective systems are all reduced by the electric fields , with slight dependence on the field directions . in the narrowed band gap , the energy levels of the defect states shift with the field directions remarkably , independent of whether the defect states are occupied or not .",
    "the @xmath5 lower the energy levels of the defect states .",
    "the @xmath8 uplift the energy of the defect states .",
    "the energy levels of the defect states are between the above two cases , when @xmath7 is applied .",
    "as shown in table  [ tgap ] , when electric fields are applied , with the increase of the angle @xmath10 , the relative movement of the defect states and the band edge states makes @xmath22 increase and @xmath23 decrease . in some defective systems , the lowest unoccupied defect state can be pushed into the conduction band by the electric fields , it makes the absence of the @xmath22 in some cases in the table  [ tgap ] . and",
    "the highest occupied defect state can be also pushed into the valence band .",
    "the localized charge densities of these defects keep almost unchanged under electric fields . in fig .",
    "[ fchg ] , as an example , the profiles of the charge density of the lowest unoccupied defect state of the bnnt with @xmath12 defect without and with 0.3 v /  @xmath8 are shown .",
    "although the energy levels of defect states move almost linearly with the increase of @xmath10 in all cases , it affects the concentration of carriers differently , depending on the kind of defects . for bnnts with @xmath16 and @xmath15 defects , the 0.3 v /  @xmath5 results in a small @xmath22 and enhances the _ p_-type conductivity .",
    "the 0.3 v /  @xmath8 reduces the @xmath23 and enhances the _ n_-type conductivity most for the bnnt with @xmath14 defect .",
    "in other situations , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 are maybe still too large to improve the conductivity significantly .",
    "however , we can use the change of conductivity under electric fields with different directions to identify the defect positions . if we change the directions of the transverse electric fields and measure the conductivity , for bnnts with _",
    "p_-type carriers , when the electric field is applied from the pristine side to the defective side , we would get the max conductance . for bnnts with _ n_-type carriers , we can get the max conductance at the reversed field direction . for the bnnts with carbon substitution and single vacancy defects ,",
    "the local magnetic moments show slight dependence on the field directions ( see table  [ tmag ] ) , it can be related to the change of @xmath22 or @xmath23 . especially , in the bnnt with @xmath16 defect , when the electric fields are applied , with the increase of @xmath10 , the magnetic moment is reduced . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fband](b ) , in the band gap , there is one unoccupied defect state in the majority spin channel , and two in the minority spin channel .",
    "the reduction of @xmath22 can increase the occupation probability on the lowest unoccupied defect state in the majority spin channel , so the total local spin can be increased , and the local magnetic moment can thus be enhanced .",
    "other cases can be understood in a similar way .",
    "when the @xmath22 and @xmath23 are not so small , the magnetic moment changes little with the electric field .    to understand the behavior of defect states under electric fields",
    ", we present an explanation based on the field induced electrostatic potential shift .",
    "when @xmath5 is applied , the defect is at the low potential side . while the field is reversed , the defect becomes at a relative high potential .",
    "so the electrostatic potential at the defect site can be related to @xmath10 .",
    "if we take the center of the bnnts as origin , at which the electrostatic potential is set to zero , the potential induced by electric fields at defect sites can be expressed as @xmath24 in which @xmath25 is the strength of the transverse electric field ( 0.3 v /  ) , @xmath4 is the @xmath4 coordinate of the defect site . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fdef ] , we examine the energy levels of the defect states and the band edge states with the @xmath26 induced by electric fields , taking bnnts with @xmath12 and @xmath17 defects as examples",
    ". the energy levels of the localized defect states are raised significantly with the increase of electrostatic potential at the defect sites .",
    "however , the levels of cbe and vbe are little affected compared to those of the defect states . the behavior of @xmath23 and @xmath22 under electric fields thus can be ascribed to the change of electrostatic potential at defect sites . and it can be expected that , stronger @xmath5 would bring down the electrostatic potential at the defect sites further , and reduce @xmath22 more .",
    "the reversed stronger electric fields would reduce @xmath23 similarly .    in most situations ,",
    "@xmath21 is reduced to the value similar to the pristine bnnt under the electric field .",
    "but in some cases , the @xmath21 is unexpectedly large .",
    "those are bnnts with @xmath16 , @xmath15 , and @xmath12 under 0.3 v /  @xmath5 and bnnts with @xmath14 under 0.3 v /  @xmath8 .",
    "the large @xmath21 is related to the corresponding small @xmath22 or @xmath23 in these cases .",
    "the small @xmath22 or @xmath23 enhances the metallicity of that system , and thus increases the screening . with the stronger screening ,",
    "the reduction of electrostatic potential along the direction of electric field is slower , therefore , @xmath21 reduction is smaller .",
    "it can be seen from the profiles of @xmath27-plane - averaged electrostatic potential under 0.3 v /  @xmath5 and @xmath8 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fpot ] .    from the above results",
    ", we can see that , the electric fields can adjust the electronic structures of the defective bnnts in a different way from pristine bnnts .",
    "the transverse electric fields narrow the band gaps , move the defect states near to the vbe or cbe , and can change the conductive and optical properties smoothly . under the same strength of electric fields ,",
    "the quantities of @xmath22 and @xmath23 change monotonously with the increase of the angle @xmath10 .",
    "compared to @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the @xmath21 changes little with @xmath10 .",
    "so transverse electric fields can create shallow acceptor or donor states , depending on the kind of defects and the field directions .",
    "for one kind of defective bnnts , one can measure the conductivity under different direction of electric fields , to identify the positions of the defects .",
    "the change of @xmath22 and @xmath23 under electric fields can also affect the local magnetic moments in the bnnts with single vacancy and carbon substitution defects .",
    "the charge densities of the localized defect states are all almost unaffected by the electric fields . besides changing their conductivity ,",
    "the electric field engineering of the electronic structures of the defective bnnts can also modify their optical properties .",
    "these external field tunnable properties facilitate application of defective bnnts as nano devices .",
    "in summary , we study the electronic structures of defective bnnts under transverse electric fields",
    ". the band gaps of these bnnts can be reduced by electric field like that in pristine bnnts .",
    "the relative positions of the defect states in the band gap are moved when the transverse electric field direction is changed .",
    "the charge densities of localized defect states are not affected by the electric field .",
    "the behavior of electronic structures can be ascribed to the difference of the electrostatic potential induced by electric fields at the defect sites .",
