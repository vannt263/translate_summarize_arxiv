    "the exact shape of these spectral features in the x - ray binaries depends on ionization state of the reflecting medium and might be modified by strong gravity effects and intrinsic motions in the reflector ( e.g. fabian et al . , 1989 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the reflection signatures depends primarily on the ionization state and the solid angle subtended by the reflector as seen from the source of the primary radiation .    recently , revnivtsev , gilfanov & churazov ( 1999 , hereafter paper i ) proposed fourier frequency resolved spectral analysis to study spectral variability in the x - ray binaries . although interpretation of the fourier frequency resolved spectra in general",
    "is not straightforward and requires a priori assumptions to be made , one of the areas where this method can be efficiently used is the fast variability of the reflected component .",
    "it has been found that in the low spectral state of cyg x-1 and gx339 - 4 the energy spectra corresponding to the shorter time scales ( @xmath8 sec ) show less reflection than those of longer time scales ( revnivtsev , gilfanov & churazov 1999 , 2000 ) .",

    "the geometry , element abundances and ionization state of the reflector being fixed , the equivalent width of the fe fluorescent line determined from a conventional energy spectrum is proportional to the relative amplitude of the reflected component and approximately measures the solid angle subtended by the reflector .",
    "the equivalent width of the fluorescent line determined from a fourier frequency resolved spectrum measures the ratio of the rms amplitudes of variations of the reflected component and the primary emission in a given fourier frequency range .",
    "the constancy of the equivalent width of the line at fourier frequencies @xmath30 hz observed in the soft state ( fig.[eqw ] ) implies that the rms amplitude of variations of the reflected component has the same frequency dependence as that of the primary radiation .",
    "this would naturally appear if the reflected emission was reproducing variations of the primary radiation down to the time scales of @xmath31 msec .",
    "such behavior is in contrast to the hard spectral state , in which variations of the reflected flux are notably suppressed in comparison with the primary emission on the time scales shorter than @xmath32 msec .",
    "the most straightforward explanation of this effect would be in terms of a finite light crossing time of the reflector @xmath33 due to its finite spatial extend @xmath34 . in this case the frequency dependence of the fluorescent line equivalent width , @xmath35 , is determined by the geometry of the primary source and the reflector .",

    "below we consider this problem in a more quantitative way .",
    "the time dependence of the reflected emission is defined by the following relation : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are primary and reflected flux , @xmath41  the transfer function of the reflector , defined by the geometry .",

    "the equivalent width of the fluorescent line determined from the fourier frequency resolved spectra is @xmath47 i.e. is proportional to the fourier transform of the transfer function of the reflector .",
    "fig.[timeresp ] shows the transfer function and its fourier transform for an isotropic point source located at the height @xmath48 above a flat disk with the inner radius @xmath49 and inclination angle @xmath50 for different values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "a lambert law for the angular dependence of the reflected flux has been assumed .",
    "no general or special relativity effects have been taken into account .",
    "the characteristic width of the @xmath35 dependence is mainly defined by the distance @xmath51 between the primary source and the inner edge of the disk and depends only weakly on the inclination angle @xmath50 .",
    "a small offset of the primary source , @xmath52 or non - zero opening angle of the disk do not significantly affect the characteristic width of fourier transform of the response function ( fig.[ri100var ] ) .",

    "] we compare fourier transform of the transfer function of a flat disk with inclination @xmath53 , appropriate for cyg x-1 @xcite , with the frequency dependence of the equivalent width observed in the soft and hard spectral states of cyg x-1 . as seen from fig.[eqw_mod ]",
    ", suppression of the high frequency variations in the reflected emission observed in the hard state can be satisfactorily described by reflection from a disk with an inner radius of @xmath54 around a @xmath5 black hole .",
    "significantly larger , @xmath55 , or smaller values of the inner radius , @xmath56 , are inconsistent with the data .",
    "the soft state data , on the other hand , requires much smaller values of the inner radius of the disk , @xmath57 .",
    "it should be noted that since we use the equivalent width of the fe fluorescent line as a measure of the amplitude of the reflected emission , the results might be somewhat affected by the non - uniformity of the ionization state of the accretion disk with radius and geometrical effects ( e.g. radial and azimuthal dependence of the reflection angle ) .",
    "results of more detailed modeling of the disk transfer function and rigorous comparison with the data will be published elsewhere ( a paper in preparation ) .",
    "study of fast variability of the reflected emission by means of fourier frequency resolved spectroscopy offers a new independent method to probe the geometry of the accretion flow which complements conventional x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "the presence of a luminous soft component dominating the x - ray spectrum in the soft spectral state of black hole candidates ( fig.[spe ] ) strongly favors small values of the inner radius of the disk ( e.g. gierlinski et al . , 1999 ) , in good agreement with the above result , @xmath4 . in the hard spectral state conventional estimates of the inner radius of the accretion disk range from several tens @xmath58 in coronal model ( e.g. poutanen , krolik & ryde , 1997",

    "our result , @xmath3 , falls in the middle of this range .",
    "the inner radius of the accretion disk determined in the above analysis refers to the inner radius of the `` reflective '' part of the disk , where the ionization state is such that the disk is capable to produce a fluorescent iron line",
    ". therefore substantial change of the ionization state of the surface layer of the inner disk ( e.g. young et al . , 1999 ) may have similar effect on the frequency dependence of the equivalent width of the iron line as physical change of the inner disk radius .    in the simplified geometry of an isotropic point source above flat disk solid angle subtended by the reflector",
    "is @xmath59 ( in the notation of the previous section ) . for the parameters from fig.[eqw_mod ]",
    "respective values of the solid angle are : @xmath60 for the hard state ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 for the soft state ( @xmath61 , @xmath64 ) .",
    "equivalent width of the iron fluorescent line expected for these values of the solid angle and solar abundance of iron are several times smaller than those given in the table [ bestfit ] , especially for the hard spectral state . however , as was noted above , the absolute values of the equivalent width quoted in table [ bestfit ] are subject to some uncertainty due to simplified model used for the spectral fits .",
    "comparison of the model predictions with more accurately determined values of the equivalent width and amplitude of the reflected component can further constrain geometry of the accretion flow .",
    "finally , we should note that interpretation of the frequency dependence of the equivalent width of the fluorescent line in terms of the finite light crossing time of the reflector is not unique .",
    "an alternative explanation might be that the short time scale , @xmath65 50100 msec , variations appear in a geometrically different , likely inner , part of the accretion flow and give a rise to significantly weaker , if any , reflected emission than the longer time scale events presumably originating in the outer regions .",
    "this might be caused , for instance , by a smaller solid angle of the reflector as seen by the short time scale events and/or due to screening of the reflector from the short time scale events by the outer parts of the accretion flow .",
    "however , independent of the nature of the fall off of the equivalent width at high frequency , the flat response of the reflected emission to variations of the primary radiation observed at low frequencies puts an upper limit on the spatial extent of the reflector , i.e. on the inner radius of the accretion disk .",
    "in particular , large values of @xmath49 , significantly exceeding @xmath66 in the hard and @xmath67 in the soft spectral state are excluded by our analysis .",
    "we have exploited fourier frequency  resolved spectral analysis to study fast variability of the reflected emission on time scales of @xmath68 sec  10 msec in the soft and hard spectral states of cyg x-1 .",
    "our conclusions are :    1 .   in the soft spectral state variations of the reflected component",
    "have the same frequency dependence of the rms amplitude as the primary emission up to the frequencies @xmath69 hz .",
    "this would be expected if , for instance , the reflected flux was reproducing , with flat response , variations of the primary radiation down to the time scales of @xmath31 msec .",
