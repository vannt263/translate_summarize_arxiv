    "we present here a highly biased observational review of this meeting . rather than giving an equally - weighted recap , we emphasize those aspects that happen to be of most interest  to us . in the process",
    ", we ca nt help slighting some of the interesting and important papers presented at the meeting .",
    "in particular , we are more interested in tiny - scale structures as discrete structures instead of part of a statistical distribution of turbulence .",
    "our presentation , and the detail and accuracy of our review , reflects our biases .    while the presence of tiny - scale structure is empirically fascinating , that s not why this subject and this meeting are important .",
    "rather , for tiny , discrete structures to manifest themselves observationally , they have to be _ dense _ ; otherwise you ca nt build up the high observable column densities in short path lengths . and",
    "these high densities mean _ high pressures_. this is a problem because these highly overpressured structures want to explode !    there are two types of overpressures , one with respect to the local environment and one with respect to the overall galactic hydrostatic equilibrium . locally , typical thermal pressures in the ism ( which we always write as @xmath0 , with units of @xmath1 k ) are a few thousand .",
    "turbulence , magnetism , and cosmic rays all have comparable pressures , so the total is several times the thermal pressure . in the final analysis , the ensemble / time average of the total pressure",
    "has to be the hydrostatic - equilibrium pressure for the vertical structure of the galaxy , which is @xmath2 @xmath1 k ( boulares & cox 1990 ) .",
    "the inferred pressures of tiny - scale structures as discrete objects dwarf this equilibrium pressure , so they can not possibly be confined for long .",
    "this pressure problem lies at the heart of the difficulties in understanding tiny - scale structure .",
    "the above paragraph assumes that the observational manifestation of tiny - scale structure  variability  comes from discrete structures .",
    "another possibility is that the variability arises simply from the accumulated small - scale turbulence along the line of sight ( deshpande , sins ) .",
    "another is that velocity gradients plus scintillation lead to apparent variations in optical depth ( gwinn , sins ) .",
    "in other words , the observed effects might result from actual structures ( `` things '' ) or , more elegantly , from ordinary turbulence piled up along the line of sight ( `` spooks '' ) .",
    "these appropriately descriptive terms were introduced by vladimer strelnitski ( sins ) , who discussed the `` things '' called interstellar masers .    a convention : we refer to lots of papers presented at the meeting , which we identify by placing ( sins ) after the speaker . personal comments about neutral gas are carl s , while those about ionized gas are dan s .",
    "tiny - scale atomic structure ( tsas ) is revealed by variability of 21-cm and optical absorption lines with both position and time .",
    "the story began with the original vlbi effort by dieter , welch , & romney ( 1976 ) .",
    "given our knowledge of the interstellar medium , it seemed impossible that there could be observable tiny - scale structure because it would mean high volume densities , and therefore pressures .",
    "privately , i scoffed at the possibility .",
    "but fortunately , the spirit of adventure prevailed and here we are today as a result .",
    "the tsas had inferred sizes of @xmath3 au ; the pressure problem was real , but could be ameliorated by low temperatures and anisotropy ( heiles , sins ) .    in 1997",
    "( review by heiles 1997 ; h97 ) there were vlbi studies of three sources , 3c138 , 3c147 , and 3c380 ; the first two , and probably 3c380 , showed tsas .",
    "there were searches for time variability of the 21-cm line absorption against 6 pulsars ; all showed variability .",
    "there were searches for angular changes in optical absorption lines against 17 binary stars with separations ranging down to 450 au ; all showed changes .",
    "ubiquitous_. adding spice was tiny - scale ionized structure ( tsis ) , which was revealed by extreme scattering events ( eses ) , and tiny - scale molecular structure ( tsms ) , which was revealed by time variability of h@xmath4co absorption lines .",
    "tsis and tsms might not have been ubiquitous , but they existed .      how things have evolved !",
    "tsms and tsis have flourished , with the discovery of fascinating new effects and structures (  [ tsms ] and  [ tsisobs ] ) . in tsas ,",
    "more pulsars have been observed for 21-cm line variability and some of the original variable ones have been reobserved .",
    "the result : most pulsars do _ not _ exhibit time - variable 21-cm line absorption ( weisberg & stanimirovic , minter & balser , sins ) .",
    "seven sources have been studied with vlbi ( brogan , sins ; brogan et al .",
    "2005 ) and only two exhibit tsas .",
    "3c138 stands out very distinctly as the best case",
    " it exhibits variability in _ both _ angle and time !",
    "vlbi maps are compelling in revealing it to be a single physical structure ( a `` thing '' ) ; 3c147 shows detectable structure that might be from turbulence ( a `` spook '' ) instead of a single structure .",
    "see brogan ( sins ) for details and references .",
    "so now , in 2006 , tsas , as revealed by the 21-cm line , is _ by no means _ ubiquitous !",
    "optically , though , structure remains ubiquitous .",
    "and tsis is alive and thriving .",
    "tsms is not only still there , but is also both more puzzling than ever and also more indicative of physical processes in turbulence (  [ tsms ] ) .",
    "tsas has sizes measured in tens of astronomical units ( au ) .",
    "we also find very small structure that is nt quite so tiny , as reviewed by stanimirovic ( sins ) .",
    "she discusses very low - column density clouds whose inferred sizes are @xmath5 au , lots bigger than the tsas but , nevertheless , small in anybody s book .",
    "there s a large range of unstudied scale sizes lying between `` tiny '' and typical parsec - scale structures .",
    "lauroesch ( sins ) reviewed the observations of nai absorption lines against stars .",
    "these lines have it all : time variability , angular variability from two - point sampling of binary stars , and angular variability from quite densely sampled stars in clusters",
    ".      angular differences of nai absorption against binaries are _ always _ seen ( watson & meyer 1996 ) . the projected binary separations run from 500 to 30000 au . against the globular cluster",
    "m14 the sampling is dense enough to make a good map ; variations by a factor of 16 occur on scales of 4 arcsec ( meyer & lauroesch 1999 ) .",
    "the absorbing material lies in the galactic plane , not in the cluster itself , so it s distance is probably @xmath6 pc , which translates to a variability length scale of @xmath7 au .",
    "well - sampled absorption line changes are also seen against the galactic clusters h and @xmath8 persei ( points , meyer , & lauroesch 2004 ) .",
    "time variability is definitely _ not _ ubiquitous , with only 10 detections out of at least 40 stars examined .",
    "some of these changes are really dramatic : for example , the absorption against the star 23 ori , which itself moves only 0.8 au per year , _ doubles every year!_.    crawford ( 2003 ) presents an excellent comprehensive review of both the data and their interpretation .",
    "all but one of these time - variable absorption line stars lie behind shell structures , seen either as supernovae remnants or as expanding hi bubbles in the 21-cm line , so it s not just the motion of the star but also the motion of the foreground gas itself that produces rapid variability .",
    "the one exception is @xmath9 vel ; despite its location in the constellation velorum , it lies well away from both the vela supernova remnant and the gum nebula , so the variablity arises from the star s motion alone .",
    "common optical interstellar absorption lines are produced by minority ionization species .",
    "nai is the most convenient , and consequently its line is the one that usually reveals time- and angle- variability . as a minority species , its line strength @xmath10 ( heiles , sins ) .",
    "tsas should be cold and dense , so these lines should be strong . moreover , the line strength is sensitive to temperature and density , so its variations with angle and time might be tracing small changes in environmental conditions instead of large changes in total column density of na ( and h ) nuclei .",
    "there are two arguments that nai variations are primarily tracing relatively small changes in environmental conditions :    1 .",
    "majority ionization species are better tracers of total column density than minority ones .",
    "majority ionization species are less well studied , but when they are observed they rarely exhibit variations with angle or time ; for example , see lauroesch et al .",
    "the ci fine structure lines are very good tracers of interstellar pressure ( jenkins & tripp 2001 ; jenkins , sins ) .",
    "lauroesch et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and welty & fitzptrick ( 2001 ) observed ci lines that correspond to time - variable nai lines , but find no unusually large pressures .",
    "both arguments favor the idea that nai variability results from small changes in environmental conditions instead of large changes in column density .",
    "however , the jury is still out !",
    "crawford ( 2003 ) explicitly discusses the important caveat : multiple regions along the line of sight tend to mask high - pressure low - column density regions , and some of the observed lines do indeed look like they have multiple components .",
    "jenkins ( sins ) interprets his recent data as supporting the presence of high - pressure regions (  [ jenkins ] ) ; and crawford argues quite convincingly that two stars ( hd32040 and hd219188 ) do , indeed , indicate high - pressure regions .",
    "it seems that the most straightforward conclusion is that most of the optical variability comes from ionization effects  but also that the most straightforward conclusion may not be correct , at least in some cases .",
    "we clearly need lots more work in this area !",
    "this is very relevant to tsas because of the tsas pressure problem .",
    "jenkins ( sins ) follows the techniques of jenkins & tripp ( 2001 ) to derive pressures for about 100 stars .",
    "their technique exploits the relative populations of the three fine structure spectral lines associated with the @xmath11p ci ground state .",
    "the populations of the three levels depend on collision rates , and comparing the three line intensities provides information on density and temperature in a form that approximates pressure .",
    "thus ci is a probe of interstellar pressure .",
    "jenkins finds that the probability density function of the pressure is bimodal .",
    "the primary component , which contains most of the mass , is centered near @xmath12 @xmath1 k. this is undoubtedly the standard cnm , whose statistical properties are given by heiles & troland ( 2005 ) .",
    "the other is centered near the amazingly high @xmath13 @xmath1 k.    this high - pressure component is just what we need for tsas ! instead of invoking the physically - reasonable pressure equality between tsas and other interstellar components , together with the necessary adoption of unusual temperatures and geometries",
    ", we might simply throw caution to the winds and accept the high pressure ! for these @xmath14 @xmath1 k components",
    ", jenkins suggests that the temperature must exceed 100 k. this greatly increases ( by a factor @xmath15 ) the quasi - equilibrium tsas column density at @xmath16 k. if indeed there are components with this pressure and temperature , then heiles s ( sins ) equation ( 6 ) implies the components are roughly spherical !",
    "so we have two contrasting ideas .    1 .   the h97 picture of approximate _ pressure equality _ , minimizing the tsas pressure by a invoking a combination of the lowest possible tsas temperature ( 16 k ) and morphological _",
    "anisotropy_. 2 .",
    "in contrast , we have the jenkins picture of huge _ overpressure _ and much warmer tsas ( @xmath17 k ) , and approximate morphological _ isotropy_.",
    "how different can you get ?    the jenkins picture produces a severe overpressure for the tsas , and any such structure would explode at mach 20 or so .",
    "it could nt last long and the ensemble of observed structures would be continually dissolving and reforming .",
    "so from the standpoint of _ theoretical interpretation _ , it s hard to envision .",
    "however , from the standpoint of _ pure empiricism _ , this is nt a problem because both the high pressures and the tsas time variablity are _",
    "observed_and correct observations always trump theory .",
    "nevertheless , i am bothered : from the conceptual framework of astrophysics , it s hard for me  even as an _",
    "observer _ by trade  to imagine a mechanism by which such structures can actually be produced at a sufficient rate that we see them reasonably often , and i keep looking for ways to discount jenkins s results .",
    "this reminds me of the situation i described in the first paragraph of this paper : i m privately scoffing at the possibility that jenkins s high pressures are correct . and ,",
    "of course , i was wrong then       as a side project , ivan king ( private communication ) is using the turnover region of the hr diagram , whose tracks are roughly orthogonal to the reddening vector , to derive accurate reddenings of individual stars .",
    "this works well for mapping the reddening against globular clusters , which contain lots of evolved stars .",
    "he has already made maps for about 20 clusters , and intends to double that number !",
    "he typically sees reddening structure at the level of a few hundredths of a magnitude in e(b - v ) , or @xmath18 @xmath19 , on 20 arcsec scales ( but so far , at least , not below ) .",
    "if the absorbing material is 100 pc distant , this corresponds to a few thousand au .",
    "these are extinctions , so they reflect _ total _ column densities . if this variability is produced by isotropic structures , then the volume density @xmath20 is equal to the column density divided by the length scale , which is @xmath21 @xmath1 ; at any reasonable interstellar temperature , this produces a hefty overpressure",
    "!    it would be very interesting to compare the nai maps with the total extinction maps ; this would provide a definitive measurement of the degree to which the nai variations are produced by ionization structure .",
    "here at this meeting we are focused on tiny - scale structure in _ total _ density , but clearly tiny - scale structure in _ ionization fraction",
    "_ opens up a new window on the ism . and",
    "comparison of these two datasets provides both !      optical images of reflection nebulae have the capability of revealing small - column density structures .",
    "a spectacular example is the pleiades , where a network of very fine - scale aligned filaments is seen in scattered light .",
    "the alignment suggests a magnetic field .",
    "it is thought that the cluster and the ism encountered each other by chance and that the ism has suffered only minimal interaction with the cluster , so we have a nice unbiased sample of tiny - scale structures in the ism that happen to lie `` under a streetlight '' .",
    "gibson ( sins ) combined optical and radio images of the pleiades optical reflection nebulosity over resolution scales ranging from @xmath22 arcsec ( hst pc image ) , to @xmath23 arcsec ( wiyn telescope image with excellent seeing ) , to @xmath24 arcsec ( a mosaic of burrell schmidt images ) , to somewhat larger ( vla d - array image with zero - spacing from the gbt ) .",
    "combining all these into a single power spectrum yields a power - law index @xmath25this is over 5 orders of magnitude in scale !",
    "this is close to kolmogoroff , like the famous armstrong , rickett , & spangler ( 1995 ) spectrum , which covers even more range but is patched together from disparate data sources and astronomical objects .",
    "it is also the same slope found by deshpande , dwarakanath , & goss ( 2000 ) in their vla map of cas a. the similarity of all these slopes suggests that this slope is a robust characteristic of the ism .",
    "clearly , such studies of more regions would confirm ( or deny ) this suggestion .",
    "but suppose , after more studies , that the slope turns out to be about the same everywhere .",
    "then we have to ask : so what ?",
    "if the same slope applies to disparate types of region , does it provide any useful physical information or physical insight ?",
    "mcclure - griffiths ( sins ) showed a fabulous map of the riegel - crutcher cloud , which is a cold cloud seen in self - absorption discovered decades ago .",
    "her new map uses the sgps data to map a huge section of the cloud with exquisite angular resolution ( @xmath6 arcsec ) .",
    "the images show angel - hair structure with clear filaments whose widths are unresolved at about 0.07 pc resolution . with column densities @xmath26 @xmath19 ,",
    "the volume density @xmath27 @xmath1 if they are cylindrical . with the inferred temperature @xmath28 k ,",
    "this leads to overpressures with @xmath29 @xmath1 k.    these overpressures are not unexpected because this cloud is associated with the edge of the north polar spur , which is an expanding superbubble . from x - ray data ( nousek et al .  1982 ) , one can estimate the internal hot - gas pressure to be @xmath30 @xmath1 k. this hot , overpressured gas drives the shock , which sweeps up the gas into the cold shell containing this cloud",
    ". the cloud pressure should be comparable to the hot gas , but it s lower .",
    "this is nt so bad , though , because the filamentary angel - hair structure suggests a magnetic field , which adds pressure .",
    "mcclure - griffiths uses optical polarization of background stars with the chandrasekhar - fermi method to infer a magnetic field strength of @xmath28 @xmath31 g in the filaments ; this is large , far larger than the hot gas pressure ! pressure equality would want a field strength @xmath32 @xmath31 g .",
    "chandrasekhar - fermi field strengths are not very accurate , so maybe it all works out . in any case ,",
    "any overpressure problem here is small compared to the pressure problems posed by the discrete - cloud interpretation of the tsas .",
    "this is a cold cloud whose origin is clear : it s the shell associated with the expanding north polar spur superbubble , and the cloud gas was swept up by the superbubble shock .",
    "this cloud is nearby and presents an ideal opportunity to study the detailed structure of a supershell wall .",
    "in particular , we often think that tsas ( and tsis ) might be associated with shocks , and this is an ideal opportunity to find out . with its well - defined self - absorption 21-cm",
    "line and large suggested magnetic field , it s an ideal candidate for zeeman splitting .",
    "we have four different ideas for tsas :    1 .",
    "tsas is discrete structures in approximate thermal pressure equality with other ism phases ( heiles , sins ) . to achieve this",
    ", the tsas temperatures must be cold , approaching the lowest possible limit of 16 k. and it requires nonspherical structures with morphological anisotropy factor @xmath33 or so .",
    "velocity gradients plus scintillation lead to apparent variations in optical depth of small hi structures ( gwinn , sins ) .",
    "tsas is simply a result of the pileup of column density versus velocity along the line of sight that results from the turbulent cascade spectrum ( deshpande , sins ) .",
    "the spectrum needs to be flat enough to provide enough small - scale structure .",
    "there are probably some lines of sight where this requirement is satisfied .",
    "tsas can result from discrete objects or turbulent fluctuations that are highly overpressured ( jenkins , sins ) .",
    "temperatures are @xmath17 k , somewhat warmer than standard cnm temperatures .",
    "if we have discrete structures , they can be round",
    ".    it would nt be surprising for all ideas to apply , with one idea dominating a particular sightline depending on conditions . but  how to empirically decide in any particular case ?    1",
    "if discrete objects have sharp edges , they can be recognized by mapping the tsas absorption against background extended sources . in the optical we can do this with star clusters and in the radio with vlbi against background radio sources .",
    "vlb maps of 3c138 show a spectacular discrete object .",
    "the concept of tsas being discrete objects is the simplistic , nave observer s view , which is why it appeals to me .",
    "if tsas simply results from interstellar turbulence , then we expect the slope of the turbulent spectrum to be flatter in regions that exhibit tsas .",
    "we no longer regard tsas as being ubiquitous , so if the turbulent slope is the same everywhere  as might be suggested by gibson s ( sins ) results  then this would argue against tsas being simply turbulence .",
    "if tsas is highly overpressured as suggested by jenkins ( sins ) , then the ci line ratios should reflect this so there should be an observable correlation between high pressures and the presence of tsas .",
    "existing studies do nt show such a correlation , but we must emphasize the caveats that crawford ( 2003 ) has suggested .",
    "marscher , moore , & bania ( 1993 ) and moore & marscher ( 1995 ) detected tsms in ordinary molecular clouds by time variability of the 6-cm h@xmath4co lines seen in absorption against quasars .",
    "the inferred transverse sizes @xmath32 au and densities @xmath34 @xmath1 . with @xmath35",
    "k these densities give @xmath36 @xmath1 k , which greatly exceeds standard pressures in the ism .",
    "however , this huge overpressure does not necessarily imply explosive expansion because self - gravity is an important force in molecular clouds .",
    "heithausen ( sins ) reviewed his remarkable small area molecular structures ( sams ) .",
    "these are small , dense galactic molecular clouds , which he discovered serendipitously while mapping mm - wave molecular lines in tidal features of the m81 group ( heithausen 2002 ) . with overall sizes @xmath23 arcmin",
    ", we can not classify an individual sams as `` tiny '' in the sense used for tsas .",
    "however , the sams contain substantial substructure ( heithausen 2004 ) at the few arcsec scale , equivalent to a few hundred au at a distance of 100 pc : that certainly classifies them as tiny !    an unbiased search ( heithausen 2006 ) shows that they might be very common .",
    "dirsch , richtler , & gmez ( 2005 ) serendipitously found one optically in projection against ngc3269 , which shows that column densities are high .",
    "so far , these objects have been seen only at high galactic latitudes , where their weak emission does nt have to compete with the much stronger co emission at lower latitudes .",
    "they are not embedded in dense hi and are best described as lying `` in the middle of nowhere '' ; it would be like having a city block of new york city in the middle of new mexico .    with volume densities of h - nuclei @xmath37",
    "several thousand @xmath1 , these objects are heavy and should fall towards @xmath38 , yet their velocities are low ( @xmath39 km s@xmath40 ) and they seem to be plentiful",
    ". maybe they are held together and/or are prevented from falling by a magnetic field , as suggested by don cox .",
    "what makes them ? what s their life cycle like ?",
    "why do their interiors have such small substructure at the tsas size scale ?",
    "as such , we can call them tsms , and in some respects they are even more challenging than tsas .",
    "recent studies of tsms by the french group concentrate on macroscopic velocity gradients and their associated turbulent dissipation on nonequilibrium chemistry .",
    "these studies are detailed by hily - blant ( sins ) and falgarone ( sins ) .",
    "they used the iram 30 m telescope to map @xmath41co and @xmath42co in the taurus molecular clouds and found filaments with diameters ranging down to @xmath43 au , which size is limited by the angular resolution .",
    "these filaments follow the local magnetic field orientation as derived from starlight polarization .",
    "the filaments have h@xmath4 volume densities ranging up to @xmath5 @xmath1 , with @xmath44 k. these conditions are not particularly extreme for molecular clouds and do not produce a severe overpressure .",
    "what is very unusual , however , is the macroscopic velocity field associated with the filaments .",
    "the filaments exhibit intense velocity shear in the form of vorticity , with velocity changes of 1 km s@xmath40 over the filament width of 1000 au ; this amounts to an impressively high velocity gradient of 200 km s@xmath40 pc@xmath40 ! these large gradients are seen only in the filaments , so we conclude that the vorticity and the presence of thin filaments are related . as we mentioned above , the filaments are aligned with the local magnetic field , and this association might be an important part of the dynamics .    hily - brandt suggests that the dissipation of these large gradients can be a source of local heating that is unrelated to the usual mechanism of photons or cosmic rays , and in particular can generate large local temperatures that can greatly accelerate chemical processes that require high activation energy .",
    "observations of such chemistry come from higher resolution observations of certain difficult - to - form molecules .",
    "falgarone ( sins ) described the molecular maps made with the plateau de beurre mm - wave array .",
    "these show hco@xmath45 with abundance far above those predicted by equilibrium models , by factors of 10 to 100 .",
    "the lines are much wider ( several km s@xmath40 ) than the thermal width , and this is consistent with the large velocity gradients seen in the filaments of hily - brandt .",
    "overabundances of h@xmath4o and oh by similar factors are seen by swas .",
    "the chemistry of hco@xmath45 requires high abundances of ch@xmath45 and @xmath42ch@xmath45 , whose formation requires an activation energy of 4640 k ; production of the overabundant oh and h@xmath4o from o and h@xmath4 requires activation energy 2980 k.    how can such temperatures be produced in a molecular cloud ?",
    "this pair of papers by hily - brandt ( sins ) and falgarone ( sins ) makes a strong case that this energy comes from dissipation of the large velocity gradients that reside in the vorticity associated with the filaments .",
    "studies like this are fascinating because they reveal unusual aspects of turbulence : vorticity , large velocity gradients , dissipation , and intermittency .",
    "do such processes also play roles in tsas and tsis ?",
    "tiny ionized structure comes in two flavors : classical turbulence at tiny scales ( `` spooks '' in this meeting s parlance ) and actual high - density structures ( `` things '' ) . and also , probably , there are mixtures . here",
    "we separate observed phenomena into these two categories , but bear in mind that the separation might not be so well - defined ; an example is arclets .",
    "we should keep in mind deshpande s ( sins ) warning that one person s structures might be another person s statistical fluctuations    brisken ( sins ) , stinebring ( sins ) , and rickett ( sins ) describe the observations and theory of arcs and substructure .",
    "stinebring concentrates on observations , the other two on theory ",
    "brisken on details of scattering theory and rickett more with the global interpretation .",
    "cordes ( sins ) and rickett ( sins ) describe classical scintillation .",
    "pulsar radiation is greatly affected by its journey through ionized gas .",
    "the simplest effects are the classical ones of dispersion and faraday rotation .",
    "scintillation / scattering is more complicated because it depends on the characteristics of electron density fluctuations .",
    "the observable effects include angular broadening , time variability , and frequency structure  all a result of `` spooks '' .",
    "the turbulence itself is described by the power spectral index , together with the inner and outer scales .",
    "these scales range from a few hundred _ kilometers _ ( ! ) to a few hundred au  truly tiny stuff !",
    "moreover , the fluctuations @xmath46 are nt large , so there is no pressure problem as we have for tsas",
    ".    however , there were important clues in the scintillation literature , stretching back more than 25 years , that classical turbulence is not the whole story .",
    "there were examples of  tilted scintles \" and  fringing events \" that seemed to require excess bending power in the medium that could not be provided by a kolmogorov spectrum of density variations .",
    "these puzzles started to clarify with the discovery of `` scintillation arcs '' ( stinebring et al .",
    "these clues form part of the non - classical scintillation picture , which , in turn , may be related to other long - standing puzzles , as we discuss below .",
    "they lead to the necessity for actual _ structures _       some observational phenomena demand the presence of tiny ( @xmath47  au ) _ structures _ in the ionized gas , and we reserve the acronym tsis ( short for tsi _ structures _ ) for this stuff .",
    "the observational phenomona include a specific pattern of quasar flux variability known as extreme scattering events ( eses ) , and also rapid time variability known as intra - hour and intra - day variables ( ihv , idv ) . for pulsars , we see arcs and arclets ; the arcs arise from `` spooks '' , and the arclets might require `` things '' .",
    "we think of these effects being produced by discrete ionized structures with large densities  and , in contrast to the classical pulsar scintillation , they _ do _ produce a pressure problem in the tsas sense ( rickett , sins ) .",
    "the effect of turbulence on the scattering and scintillation properties is described by the fluctuation parameter @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is filling factor ) , which comes from the theory of wave propagation in the presence of fluctuations . while we ( or at least some of us ) can do the nontrivial propagation theory , what we _ can not _ do is to predict how @xmath50 depends on _ physical conditions _ in the interstellar medium .",
    "in other words , we have yet to understand how to relate physical processes  energy input mechanisms , ionization mechanisms , shocks  to the electron density fluctuations , their spectrum , and the inner / outer scales .",
    "nevertheless , the fluctuation parameter @xmath50 tells us a lot : it s much bigger ( factor @xmath6 ) in the inner galaxy than in the outer , which tells us that energy input from young stars , both living and dying , increases turbulence .",
    "cordes ( sins ) reviews the pulsar scintillation literature with an eye towards its dependence on galactic structure .",
    "although classical pulsar scintillation is a valuble probe of the ionized medium , there is nothing here that requires over - pressured , discrete structures .",
    "a kolmogorov turbulence spectrum ( or similar ) distributed uniformly , or with some intermittency , along the line of sight can explain most of the classical  scintle \" structure in pulsar dynamic spectra .",
    "we want to clarify the concept of the `` thin screen '' of scintillation theory and observations . this terminology can be misleading .",
    "the  thin screen \" approximation is often invoked in scintillation theory because it is tractable and gives some physical insight . in the evidence above ( stinebring , sins )",
    "the thinness of scintillation arcs indicate that much of the scattering is localized in",
    " thin screens .",
    "\" these may sound like thin , sheetlike structures whose dimension along the line of sight is much smaller than that on the plane of the sky .",
    "this is the _ wrong picture ! _",
    "the term `` thin screen '' means only that the ionized , scattering medium occupies a small fraction of the line of sight . its actual line - of - sight length might be measured in parsecs . on the contrary ,",
    "though , the plane - of - the - sky distance that affects the scintillation is only a few tens of au : the scattering angles are very small . in other words ,",
    "the bundle of scattered radiation from the pulsar is extraordinarily thin and long and punches through any structures along the line of sight .",
    "so the `` thin screen '' could be spherical , or even a cylinder whose length along the line of sight is much , much larger than its diameter .",
    "thus , in the context of classical pulsar scattering observations , the term does not refer to the shape of the scattering region , but only to the fraction of the line of sight that it occupies .",
    "dynamic pulsar spectra usually have a characteristic pattern that looks like intersecting ocean wave trains , so it s hard to resist taking the fourier transform .",
    "the 2d power spectrum of the dynamic ( or primary ) spectrum is called the secondary spectrum .",
    "it has a conjugate - frequency axis that is proportional to differential time delay between pairs of rays from the image ( point - spread - function ) and a conjugate - time axis that is proportional to differential doppler shift between the same pairs of rays . in high sensitivity observations",
    "there is almost always faint power extending away from the origin of the secondary spectrum along a symmetric parabolic locus ( classical scintle power is localized near the origin of the secondary spectrum plane ) .",
    "a parabola arises because the differential time delay axis is proportional to offset angle squared whereas the differential doppler shift axis is proportional to offset angle .",
    "the center of the scattered beam acts like a holographic reference signal for interference between it and peripheral rays in a weak halo of scattered radio light .",
    "interference between the central part of the beam and a halo generically produces a parabolic pattern in the secondary spectrum because of this linear - quadratic relationship on angle ( see walker et al .",
    "2004 or cordes et al .",
    "2006 for further details ) .",
    "the curvature of the parabola depends in a simple way on location of the scattering material along the line of sight , observing frequency , distance to the pulsar , and pulsar proper motion .",
    "the arc curvature can be used in cases where good estimates of the pulsar distance and proper motion exist to determine the location of the scattering material along the line of sight .",
    "this determination and the remarkable thinness of some ( primary ) arcs provide strong evidence that the dominant scattering material occupies a small fraction ( @xmath51  3  % ) along the line of sight . in six of the 25 or so pulsars in which scintillation arcs have been detected ,",
    "multiple arcs are seen , implying scattering screens at different distances .",
    "in fact , recent studies ( stinebring , sins ) indicate that multiple arcs may be the norm and that we are simply limited by signal strength in detecting multiple arcs along many lines of sight .",
    "the super sensitivity of the ska would let us see many more such multiple arcs and get enough statistics to solve that problem !",
    "the parabolic arcs do not require high densities or anything exotic .",
    "they are a generic part of small angle forward scattering in the case that the point - spread - function ( psf ) can be described in terms of a central ( point - like ) beam and a wider , low - level halo .",
    "this is the psf produced by scattering in a medium with kolmogorov turbulence or any other inhomogeneity spectrum that is shallow and produces significant wings to the image .",
    "so the arcs are , in this meeting s parlance , `` spooks . ''",
    "while scintillation arcs can be explained with kolmogorov turbulence , there are frequent instances when inverted parabolas or  arclets \" show up as substructure along the main parabola .",
    "these features appear to require compact , relatively dense structures with a size of @xmath47  1  au and an electron density of @xmath47  100  @xmath1 ( hill et al .",
    "2005 ) . in one case , up to four discrete structures moved systematically along the parabola  at the proper motion speed of the pulsar  while the pulsar moved across the sky .",
    "these definitely incur a pressure problem : it s almost impossible to have ionization with @xmath52 k , so these must have @xmath53 @xmath1 k , i.e.  they are overpressured with respect to other thermal pressures by a factor @xmath54 .",
    "the physical conditions required are extreme , but less extreme than those required by extreme scattering events ( ese ) .",
    "in one of the highlights of the meeting , especially for the ionized medium crowd , brisken et al ( sins ) showed a remarkable secondary spectrum from a pulsar observed as part of a large - telescope vlbi observation . by using a software correlator on the baseband data they were able to construct a filter bank with 250  hz resolution .",
    "the pulsar obliged in producing arclet structure out to delays of more than 1  ms , a world record setter ! this may not sound like a lot , but , for the known characteristics of the scattering material along the line of sight to this pulsar ( b0834 + 06 ) , this delay corresponds to an offset from the direct line of sight of 25  mas . compare this with the angular radius of the  core \" of the scattering disk of approximately 1  mas at their observing frequency of 327  mhz !",
    "brisken et al.s results showed dozens if not hundreds of extremely thin arclets in the secondary spectrum .",
    "surely not all of these are discrete , over - pressurized features in the ism !",
    "so , some rethinking of that interpretation is needed .",
    "it looks like brisken s ultra - thin arclets clump into bands that , at the lower resolution reported by hill et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , may correspond to discrete scattering structures .",
    "it would be _ these _ that are identified with tsis , although more work is needed to pin this down .",
    "eses produce large , rapid changes in point - source flux ( walker , sins ) .",
    "they are produced by interstellar ionized structures that must be moving fast ( @xmath17 km s@xmath40 ) , have large electron columns ( @xmath55 @xmath19 ) and small sizes ( a few au ) , leading to large volume densities ( @xmath56 @xmath1 ) .",
    "large ionization requires @xmath57 so we have a _ big thermal pressure problem .",
    "_ in a new model presented at the meeting , walker invoked ram pressure and self - gravitating molecular clouds with ionized sheaths , whizzing through interstellar space at velocities up to 350 km s@xmath40 .",
    "one huge problem : to explain the observed rate , these objects need to be _ plentiful _ : they are so small that for them to ever produce the observed rate of events there must be a huge number scattered throughout interstellar space , of order @xmath24 pc@xmath58 ! if these are truly self - gravitating molecular clouds , they contribute a significant amount to the total interstellar mass .",
    "walker s molecular clouds sound like extreme versions of heithausen s tiny molecular clouds ( sams ) , except that the sams do nt whiz  they have small velocities .",
    "stinebring ( sins ) emphasized that scintillation arc studies may revolutionize our understanding of eses if , indeed , they turn out to be caused by the same underlying structures in the ionized medium .",
    "the reason is simple . unlike distant quasars ,",
    "pulsars have high proper motions and scan the ism relatively rapidly .",
    "in addition , the information in the secondary spectrum is interferometric in character and is influenced by scattering structures off the direct line of sight to the pulsar . in the best cases ,",
    "the field of view that influences scintillation arc substructure is @xmath47  1001000 times the angular area that causes quasar light curve variations , and this area moves across the sky at a rate that is typically 10 times greater .",
    "for example , in the case of b0834 + 06 observed by brisken , the 25:1 ratio of scattering disk size to core of the image translates into a 625:1 ratio of detection probability since only the core of the image would undergo an ese if it were to intersect an over - pressurized tsis .",
    "lovell ( sins ) described the micro - arcsecond scintillation - induced variability ( _ masiv _ ) survey .",
    "this is an unbiased survey of 482 radio sources selected for suitability ( from an original sample of 710 ) .",
    "they used the vla with four epochs , now going on five , and found 56% of the sources to be variable on intra - day time scales  the _ intra - day variables _ , or _ idvs_. with increasing rate of incidence , the variability gets weaker and slower .",
    "the variability exhibits an annual cycle and a perfect crosscorrelation at different observing sites with a time delay ; these confirm interstellar scintillation as the variability mechanism and their analysis produces limits on screen velocity , scale length of scintillation pattern , and screen distance .",
    "intra - hour variables _ ihv_s are more extreme , with faster time scales and typically large modulations ( @xmath59 in one hour ) .",
    "it seems that idvs and ihvs might be the same except for the distance of the scattering centers , with ihvs being much closer .",
    "given their extreme properties , it s not surprising that they are very rare  there are only three known .",
    "bignall ( sins ) and de bruyn & macquart ( sins ) discuss the properties , which are derived from the beautifully consistent seasonal properties and crosscorrelation time delays .    attaining variability on intra - hour time scales",
    "requires that the scattering screen be nearby , @xmath60 pc  within the local bubble ! two sources , b1257 - 326 and j1819 + 3845 , are well studied .",
    "their scattering centers lie at distances of only 10 and 2 pc , respectively !",
    "the scintillation length scales are tens of thousands of km  a few earth diameters ! the transverse velocity of the j1819 + 3845 scattering screen is 35 km s@xmath40 and its transverse dimension lies between 60 and 6000 au ; the lower limit comes from the number of years the variability has been observed and the upper from the absence of variability in nearby sources .",
    "the shapes of the scintillation patterns show that the turbulence is anisotropic by a factor 10 or so .",
    "above in  [ tsis ] , we confidently quoted high electron densities for tsis that produce arclets and rapid , strong time variability .",
    "this confidence reflects the attitude of most people at the sins meeting , and it certainly is justified for eses .",
    "however , for the other observed phenomena some caution might be in order because estimating these densities is not easy .",
    "the problem is that electron density _ fluctuations _ cause the radio wave scattering and so it is @xmath61 that is being probed , not @xmath62 alone . also , the analysis is complicated by lack of information about the thickness of the scattering screen and the largest scale of the turbulence ( the outer scale ) for a particular screen . without better information on this , it is impossible to estimate @xmath62 reliably . about the best we can say with regard to idvs and ihvs",
    "is that the screens _ may _ have overpressured tsis in them , but that it is not _ required _ ( macquart , private communication ) . if these screens are related to the same structures causing eses and scintillation arclets then there is an overpressure problem , but this is not required in order to explain the remarkable day to hour quasar variability .        1 .",
    "it is full of hot gas that emits soft x - rays ; in fact , this how it was originally discovered . 2 .",
    "it contains some fluff ( frisch , sins ; linsky , sins ) in the form of a `` cluster of local interstellar clouds '' ( clic ) , which consists of partially - ionized warm neutral medium ( @xmath63 a few thousand k ) .",
    "3 .   it might have enough magnetic fields to produce interesting dynamical effects for the local fluff ( cox & helenius 2003 ) .",
    "4 .   it contains material passing through the solar system that is coming from the direction of the sco / oph association ( frisch , sins ) .",
    "old supernovae in this association are responsible for the nearby superbubble known as the north polar spur ( radio loop i ) , so this approaching material is probably its edge .",
    "5 .   otherwise ( being simplistic and , to some , infuriating ) , it is otherwise empty and boring .      1 .   within a few pc",
    "it contains the most spectacular ihv - producing scattering screen ( for the source j1819 + 3845 ) .",
    "given its location , this screen might be a boundary of one of linsky s ( sins ) clouds  or a common boundary of two of them , perhaps in collision .",
    "2 .   within a dozen pc",
    "it contains the second out of three ihv - producing screens ( for the source b1257 - 326 ) .",
    "all of the ihvs lie within the local bubble .",
    "3 .   it contains , within 40 pc distance , the coldest known hi cloud , which has aspect ratio like a few pieces of paper ( meyer , sins ) .    if we have all of these interesting structures so close to the sun , and if we are not the center of the universe , then extreme objects like this are much more common than we normally imagine !",
    "one more thing : do these interesting structures exist _ because _ they are embedded in the hot gas of the local bubble , or is the hot gas _",
    "incidental _ to their existence ?",
    "hi folks , who study neutral gas , tend to think of tsas , with its length scales of tens of au , as tiny .",
    "pulsar and ihv / idv folks , who study scintillation phenomena , consider the same tsas as huge  because they concentrate on ionized gas , whose density - dependent refractive index allows them to see truly tiny structures .",
    "we think of the regimes as disparate , but this thinking might simply reflect our myopic concentration on our own areas of specialty :    1 .",
    "iss reveals tsis ionized turbulent scales from hundreds of km to hundreds of au  a factor of @xmath64 .",
    "_ larger _ iss scales would nt be easy to see , so pulsar and ihv / idv folks would nt be aware of it .",
    "tsas observations reveal scales of tens of au upwards . _",
    "smaller _ scales would nt be easy to see because the observations tend to be sensitivity limited .",
    "so the observable regimes of tsas and tsis do nt overlap . in their observable regimes ,",
    "the tsas and tsis power spectra have comparable slopes .",
    "are the power spectral densities  the factors out in front ",
    "do tsis and tsas fit onto the _ same _ power spectrum ?",
    "in other words , does the beautiful power - law spectrum for ionized gas of armstrong et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which covers a range of almost 100 km to 100 pc , apply to neutral gas as well ?        1 .",
    "as discussed by ransom ( sins ) , globular clusters contain lots of evolved stars , and many neutron stars have been spun up because space is crowded with stars and binary systems form easily .",
    "these turn into pulsars , and those pulsar dms reveal changes in @xmath65 on small angular scales . most of these changes come from the foreground galactic gas , not gas in the cluster , because the electron columns are not correlated with pulsar acceleration ( and statistically , the observed acceleration depends on the pulsar location with respect to the cluster s center ) .",
    "maps of optical nai absorption lines reveal changes in @xmath66 in the foreground gas on small angular scales .",
    "@xmath66 depends on @xmath67 and @xmath62 ( and therefore , to some degree , @xmath65 ) .",
    "3 .   a clever new technique by ivan king using ",
    "stars!!reveals changes in extinction , and therefore @xmath67 , in the foreground gas on small angular scales ."
