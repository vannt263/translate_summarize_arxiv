    "it is the frustration - induced interchain charge polarization rather than the two - band modeling employed that breaks the electron - hole symmetry .",
    "there is a possibility of structural instabilities of longer period existing under doping .",
    "indeed we have extensively investigated solutions of @xmath187 , including incommensurate phases , but none of them competes in energy with those of @xmath109 in the present modeling .",

    "the @xmath190 orbitals are effectively @xmath191- and @xmath192-filled , where formally commensurate , that is to say , cell - tripled , @xmath20-cdw states are found , while at @xmath193 and @xmath194 the @xmath190 orbitals are effectively @xmath195- and @xmath196-filled , where subharmonic , namely , cell - quintupled , @xmath20-cdw states are found .",
    "trimerized cdw solutions are available at @xmath197 and @xmath198 , whereas pentamerized ones are detectable at @xmath199 and @xmath200 , but they are never stabilized into the ground state under the standard parametrization .",
    "with increasing @xmath201 , however , they closely compete in energy with dimerized cdw solutions and finally become preferable in general . in the cases of @xmath188 and @xmath189 ,",
    "the transition points are estimated at @xmath202 and @xmath203 , respectively , while in the cases of @xmath193 and @xmath194 , they turn out @xmath204 and @xmath205 , respectively , all of which may be too large to be realized in available platinum halides .",
    "it was predicted for a single @xmath35 chain that incommensurate ground states should appear even at @xmath132 filling provided the site - diagonal electron - lattice coupling is sufficiently strong , @xcite but they are not yet observed experimentally .",
    "there is an attempt at fabricating a platinum - bromide triple - chain compound .",
    "@xcite substitution of platinum ions with nickel ions should lead to stronger correlations between @xmath4 electrons and might result in novel spin arrangements .",
