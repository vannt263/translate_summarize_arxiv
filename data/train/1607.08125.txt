    "the reason is that while the regular triangle is reduced , this is no longer the case for the regular simplex in @xmath2 , @xmath1 . indeed , heil conjectured @xcite that a certain reduced subset of the regular simplex is extremal for pl s problem .",

    "in his recent arxiv preprint @xcite , polyanskii claims that he has found a reduced polytope in three - dimensional euclidean space . unfortunately , his example is invalid . in this section ,",
    "we revisit polyanskii s polytope to find its flaw .",
    "the polytope @xmath31 considered by polyanskii is the convex hull of eight points @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . for properly chosen parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    ", the points @xmath57 are the vertices of @xmath31 , see for an illustration .",
    "note that @xmath31 has the same combinatorial structure as johnson s solid @xmath58 .",
    "there are two types of vertices : the four vertices @xmath59 are incident to four edges each , and the remaining four vertices @xmath60 belong to five edges each . by symmetry , it is sufficient to take one vertex of each group and specify which faces should be strictly antipodal and at distance @xmath38 to the chosen vertices .",
    "polyanskii decides to pair the vertices @xmath61 and @xmath62 up with the facets @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "additionally , he also sets the distances between the skew edges @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and between @xmath67 , @xmath68 equal to the minimum width of @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath69 will be this common distance .",
    "this yields the four equations formulated in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "these equations may be manipulated as follows . from @xmath70 and @xmath71 ,",
    "we get @xmath72 this can be plugged into the equation @xmath73 in order to write @xmath74 as a function of @xmath75 , namely @xmath76 plugging and in @xmath77 we obtain one equation with variable @xmath75 .",
    "this equation is equivalent to the polynomial equation @xmath78 . using the relevant solution of this equation",
    ", we obtain the parameters @xmath79    if we compute the outer normal vectors of the facets @xmath80 and @xmath63 , assume their orthogonality , and substitute @xmath74 and @xmath69 according to and again , we obtain the same polynomial equation @xmath78 .",
    "in other words , provided three of polyanskii s distances are equal , the fourth distance equals the other three if and only if the orthogonal projections of the vertices @xmath59 onto their strictly antipodal faces lie on edges , i.e. , not in the relative interior of any facet .",
    "hence polyanskii s polytope is not reduced , see again .",
    "another evidence of this fact can be seen in the polyanskii s list of pairs of skew edges whose distance is larger than the presumed minimal width . in this list ,",
    "pairs of edges of type @xmath81 , @xmath82 are missing , and these pairs are exactly those where the actual minimum width @xmath83 of @xmath31 is attained .",
