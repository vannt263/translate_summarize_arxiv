    "rrently deployed wired and wireless communication systems employ half duplex .",
    "namely , either frequency division duplex ( fdd ) or time division duplex ( tdd ) has been used for separate transmission and reception . in fdd and tdd , transmitted signal does not interfere with received signal due to orthogonal use of time / frequency resources for transmission and reception . since two orthogonal channels are needed in half duplex systems , twice of time and/or frequency resources are required in half duplex compared to full duplex systems .",
    "it is clear that the capacity can be doubled by simultaneous transmission and reception in the same frequency at the same time .",
    "str or full duplex systems not only improve the physical layer capacity but also provide other important benefits in layers beyond physical layer @xcite .",
    "for example , str can reduce or completely eliminate hidden node problem which is typical issue in csma networks such as wireless local area networks ( wlan ) . when a node receives a packet designated to it and meanwhile has a packet to transmit , by having str capability it can transmit the packet while receiving the designated packet .",
    "this not only provides twice throughput but also enables hidden nodes to better detect active nodes in their neighborhoods . on the other hand ,",
    "when the node has no packet to send , it can transmit a dummy signal so that any hidden node can detect the activity in its vicinity and realize that the channel is in use .",
    "another benefit of str is significant reduction in end - to - end delay in multi - hop networks @xcite . in half duplex systems ,",
    "each node can start transmission of a packet to the next node only when it is fully received from the previous node in network .",
    "therefore , the end - to - end delay is equal to packet duration multiplied by the number of hops .",
    "however , when str is employed , a node can forward a packet while receiving it , and consequently the end - to - end delay in str systems can be just a bit longer than the packet duration .",
    "this will be a huge advantage over half duplex systems especially as the number of hops grows .",
    "meanwhile , the forwarded packet to next node can play a role of implicit acknowledgement ( ack ) to previous node as well .",
    "interesting application of str includes channel sensing in cognitive radio systems @xcite . in cognitive radios ,",
    "active secondary users have to release the spectrum when primary users start their transmissions . without str capability , it is a challenge for secondary users to detect activity of primary users while they are using the spectrum for their own communications . however , str enabled secondary users can scan the activities of primary users frequently ( even as they transmit ) and stop their transmissions immediately once they detect primary users transmissions .",
    "likewise , str makes the device discovery easier in device - to - device ( d2d ) systems .",
    "this is due to the fact that in d2d systems , when user equipment ( ue ) has str capability , it can discover neighboring ues easily by monitoring ul signals from proximate ues without stopping its own ul transmission .",
    "it is interesting to note that str techniques can be used for interference cancellation in co - existence of multiple radios in the same device .",
    "multiple radios such as wlan , bluetooth , gps receiver , 2 g and 3 g cellular transceivers are put into the same device particularly a small handheld device type @xcite .",
    "although those radios operate at different rf carriers , due to proximity of transceivers in the same device , they can still interfere with each other .",
    "this interference can be treated as echo since the transmitted signal from a radio is arrived at other radios in the same device .",
    "hence , by using the proposed technique in this paper , the co - existence issues in the same device can be resolved .",
    "multiband support requires large number of switched duplexers in fdd , resulting in quite complicated rf architecture , increased cost and form factor @xcite , @xcite .",
    "multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) and carrier aggregation techniques aggravate the situation .",
    "however , by str techniques duplexer free systems are possible by cancelling transmitted signal appeared at receive band .",
    "despite all the advantages mentioned , implementation of str has its own challenges .",
    "the main difficulty in str system is echo cancellation at receive chain .",
    "the strongest echo is introduced to the system when transmitted signal is leaked into receive chain through circulator .",
    "this causes a large interference to the desired received signal as the echo power level is much higher than desired received signal .",
    "for example , with 46 dbm output power at power amplifier ( pa ) , assuming 25 db isolation at circulator , the echo power will be 21 dbm .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned echoes , echoes can be caused by impedance mismatch at antenna .",
    "besides , transmitted signal can bounce off objects such as buildings and mountains , and return to the antenna as echoes at receive chain . hence , without echo cancellation , the received signal can not be decoded .",
    "furthermore , in order to avoid saturation at lna and high resolution adc , echo cancellation should be performed before lna .",
    "therefore , it is imperative to cancel echoes in analogue domain in order for str systems to be commercially deployable .",
    "an off - the - shelf hardware @xcite is available for rf interference cancellation in analogue and can be used for echo cancellation in rf .",
    "however , it is a narrowband interference canceller and performs interference cancellation by adjusting phase and magnitude of interference .",
    "thus , the performance of echo cancellation in wideband signals is very limited . in @xcite",
    "about 20 db echo suppression is reported for 5 mhz ieee 802.15.4 signals .",
    "in addition , this narrowband interference canceller can create higher sidelobe power than in - band interference power @xcite .",
    "an str implementation in analogue assuming separate transmit and receive antennas was reported in @xcite claiming 37 db suppression by the rf echo canceller itself .",
    "recently , @xcite presented an open - loop technique for full duplex mimo . a hardware based experiment shows 50 db of echo suppression . in @xcite , the echo cancellation using transmit beamforming is studied .",
    "this technique uses two transmit antennas and one receive antenna .",
    "the additional two transmit antennas create a null toward receive antenna , resulting in reduced echo power at receive chain .",
    "however , the transmitted signal is not omni - directionally transmitted due to the transmit beamforming .",
    "when the intended receiver is located in the null direction , signal - to - noise power ratio ( snr ) loss is inevitable .",
    "additionally , the transmit beamforming is narrowband beamforming .",
    "thus , it is not suitable for wideband signal .",
    "since this technique needs separate transmit and receive antenna set , increased form factor is unavoidable .",
    "nonetheless , the echo suppression of 20 @xmath0 30 db by this technique is not promising .",
    "however , with the aids from digital baseband cancellation and the narrowband noise canceller @xcite , the imperfect prototype achieves 1.84 times of throughput compared to half duplex system throughput .",
    "a scalable design to mimo using extra antennas with special placement antennas is proposed in @xcite . in @xcite , assuming variable delay line , one - tap echo canceller is suggested .",
    "it is shown that 45 db suppression of echo is achieved by using heuristic approach in adaptive parameter adjustment .",
    "the throughput measurements in @xcite show 111% gain in downlink .",
    "another prior work @xcite proposed to cancel echo before lna .",
    "firstly , to avoid saturation at lna , separate transmit and receive antennas with large displacement are used .",
    "various antenna orientations are investigated in @xcite .",
    "the receiver estimates the echo channel at every subcarrier using ofdm signal . using another transmit radio chain , an echo cancelling ofdm signal",
    "is generated based on the estimated channels of echo path and the additional radio , and added to the receive chain before lna .",
    "the measured echo cancellation is about 31 @xmath0 32 db in @xcite and 24 db in @xcite .",
    "this type of open - loop technique is directly sensitive to impairments as it relies on high accurate echo channel estimation . since the suppression in this case is not sufficient to realize the full duplex gain , other mechanisms such as digital domain cancellation and separate transmit / receive antenna have to be incorporated .    without using additional antennas",
    ", we propose an adaptive echo cancellation technique that can be implemented in analogue domain for wideband signals .",
    "the proposed technique is a closed - loop technique which provides more robustness to impairments than open - loop techniques .",
    "furthermore , the proposed technique is scalable to any mimo system .      as mentioned earlier , with perfect echo cancellation , str systems",
    "can achieve the doubled capacity especially in isolated links such as point - to - point communications and wireless backhaul .",
    "however , in cellular systems the situation is different .",
    "in addition to the regular co - channel interference present in half duplex systems , namely base station ( bs ) to ue and ue to bs interferences , there are two unique and serious interferences caused by system operation in full duplex mode : one is _",
    "bs - bs _ and the other is _ ue - ue_.    on one hand , due to str at bss , neighboring bss dl signals interfere with desired ul signal at home bs .",
    "this is called _ bs - bs interference _ and is extremely severe .",
    "firstly , unlike bs to ue channel ( downlink or uplink ) , bs - to - bs channel is closer to line - of - sight ( los ) with much smaller path loss . secondly , the transmit power and antenna gain at bs is much larger than those of ue .",
    "hence , the interferences from neighboring bss to home bs easily dominate desired weak ul signal .",
    "hence , without cancelling bs - bs interferences , ul communication is impossible . in this paper",
    "we suggest a solution for bs - bs interferences and provide system level evaluations for str systems with and without bs - bs interference cancellation .    on the other hand , in str systems , ul signal transmitted by a ue",
    "creates interference to dl signals received at other ues _",
    "i.e. _ , dl signal will be corrupted by proximate ul signals .",
    "this is called _ ue - ue interference _ and results in loss of dl capacity .",
    "unfortunately , with simple transceiver and omni - directional single antenna at ue , no fancy transmit and receive beamforming can be utilized in ue to handle ue - ue interference .",
    "therefore , one option to confront ue - ue interference is to coordinate between neighboring bss such that scheduler avoids scheduling proximate ue pairs that cause serious ue - ue interference to each other .",
    "however , in this paper we propose a non - cooperative technique which , despite its simplicity , can hugely reduce ue - ue interference and greatly improve dl capacity .    unlike cellular systems ,",
    "the aforesaid bs - bs and ue - ue interferences are absent in csma network such as wlan systems even when multiple co - channel cells are deployed .",
    "the reason is that due to csma protocol , access points ( aps ) or terminals will hold their transmissions if they hear any transmission from other proximate aps or terminals .",
    "in fact owing to str , the hidden node issue can be easily solved .",
    "of course collisions still can happen between nodes due to other factors such as propagation delay and some delay in header decoding .",
    "however , this is common problem even without employing str . in this paper",
    "we investigate a few protocols and demonstrate how str can reduce the hidden node problem .",
    "we show that the throughput is improved even with the assumptions of asynchronous packet arrival and some delay in decoding header or decision on channel activity .",
    "unlike @xcite where detail issues such as variable packet length , fairness and scheduler design are addressed , we study the hidden and exposed node issues in simplified model of csma which renders comparisons with theoretical throughput expression .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii analogue domain echo cancellation technique is described together with performance evaluations . in section iii , the application of str to csma network for reduction of hidden node problem is discussed and throughput improvements are demonstrated with multiple cell simulations .",
    "section iv presents the solutions for bs - bs and ue - ue interferences .",
    "finally , conclusions are provided in section v.",
    "echo cancellation is a well - known topic studied extensively in the literature and proved technology in the field . despite the comprehensive investigations ,",
    "the derivation of algorithms and implementations are performed in digital baseband . however , as described previously in section i , the echoes should be cancelled before lna _",
    "i.e. _ in analogue domain .",
    "implementing digital signal processing techniques in analogue domain is very challenging due to rf impairments and the fact that only limited mathematical operations are allowed in analogue domain . in this section ,",
    "we derive echo cancellation techniques in analogue domain and show that our method can cancel echoes very effectively even with rf impairments .",
    "the transmitted signal in passband can be written as    @xmath1    where @xmath2 represents the real part , @xmath3 is the carrier frequency in radian / sec , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are baseband in - phase and quadrature phase signals , respectively . without loss of generality , we assume one echo with unknown gain and delay . then , the received signal @xmath6 at receive chain can be modeled as    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the unknown gain and delay of the echo , respectively , @xmath10 is the desired received signal and @xmath11 is additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) . in this paper",
    "we cancel the echo in passband by creating estimated echo signal using multiple replica of @xmath12 with different delays and subtracting it from the signal corrupted by echo .",
    "for instance , the echo can be estimated by a linear combination of @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the delay of @xmath16-th tap . in order to rotate the phases of @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    ", we also need to use the hilbert transform of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "then , the estimated echo using two taps can be written as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are in - phase and quadrature component of @xmath16-th tap weight , and @xmath20 is the hilbert transform of @xmath12 .",
    "then , the echo canceller output can be expressed as    @xmath21    in order to simplify derivation of the weights @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we transform the passband model to equivalent complex baseband model .",
    "the transmitted complex baseband signal @xmath22 is defined by    @xmath23    then , from , the received signal in complex baseband is in the form of    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are complex baseband versions of desired received signal and awgn , respectively .",
    "likewise , we can develop the complex baseband model of the echo canceller output from ( [ e - t0 ] ) and ( [ cancelloutput0 ] ) as follows    @xmath27    after some manipulations , it is not difficult to show that @xmath28 .",
    "for the concise representation , the echo canceller output can be written in vector form as    @xmath29    where superscript @xmath30 represents transpose , @xmath31^t$ ] and @xmath32^t$ ] .",
    "although it is not possible to implement wiener solution in analogue domain , minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) solution provides valuable insights on the performance and design parameters . minimizing the power of the echo canceller output means that the echo is cancelled",
    "this is due to the fact that unknown desired receive signal @xmath10 and awgn can not be cancelled by linear combination of @xmath33 as @xmath33 is uncorrelated with @xmath10 and noise .",
    "therefore , we define the cost function which minimizes the power of the echo canceller output as    @xmath34    in appendix a the derivation of wiener solution in analogue domain is presented .",
    "echo cancellation performance is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mse ] where the suppression level is defined by    @xmath35    the suppression is not a function of the carrier frequency and echo power as shown in appendix a. rather , it is a function of delay difference between taps and the number of them .",
    "1 ( a ) exhibits suppression as a function of tap delay difference normalized by signal bandwidth ( b ) assuming that the echo delay is in the middle of the first and second tap delay . as it can be observed from the figure ,",
    "smaller normalized tap delay difference @xmath36 and larger number of taps provide better echo suppression .",
    "even with two taps , the suppression level close to 90 db can be achieved with the normalized tap delay difference equal to 0.01 which means 1 nsec of delay difference between taps in 10 mhz bandwidth systems .",
    "this is equivalent to 100 times oversampling in digital signal processing .",
    "it is apparent that as the tap delay difference goes to zero the suppression level goes to infinity ( _ i.e. _ no residual echo ) .",
    "we emphasize that having a small tap delay difference is not a challenging issue .",
    "for example , assuming the speed of electromagnetic ( em ) wave in transmission line is equal to the speed of light , @xmath37 difference in length will yield @xmath38 pico second delay difference . in fig .",
    "[ fig_mse ] ( b ) the effect of echo delay on echo canceller performance is illustrated assuming that the normalized tap delay difference is 0.1 . in reality",
    "the delay of echo is unknown .",
    "however , typical value or range of values of circulator delay can be measured .",
    "interestingly , when the tap delay coincides with the true delay of the echo , even with only two taps suppression beyond 150 db can be easily achieved .",
    "the reason that even when @xmath9 is equal to either @xmath39 or @xmath40 the suppression is not infinity is that @xmath41 is not approaching zero .",
    "it is simple to show that when the delay of either taps coincides with the echo delay , one tap echo canceller instead of two tap echo canceller has infinity suppression level .    in two tap wiener filter , we study the impact of number of echoes under the condition of same total echo powers .",
    "assume one echo having delay @xmath9 located in the middle of neighboring two taps    @xmath42    where @xmath43 . without loss of generality assume @xmath44 .",
    "let us add one more echo with the same power as the first echo but closer to the second tap with arbitrary phase @xmath45 and delay @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "then , @xmath56 and @xmath50 have the same power but @xmath56 has one echo in the middle of taps while @xmath50 contains two echoes : one in the middle of the taps and the other closer to either taps .",

    "[ fig_mse2echoes ] it is clear that as the second echo moves toward the second tap , the residual echo power is reduced .",
    "notice that @xmath66 means that only one echo exists .",
    "hence , the assumption of one echo in the middle of neighboring taps is the worst simulation condition .",
    "this is from the fact that echo closer to either tap is easier to estimate as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mse ] ( b ) .",
    "the argument can be easily extended to arbitrary number of echoes with arbitrary echo powers located between neighboring taps .      in the previous subsection ideal phase shifter",
    "is assumed for hilbert transform . however , due to phase imbalance in phase shifter , hilbert transform of @xmath67 will not be orthogonal to @xmath67 . to overcome the phase imbalance problem we use multiple phase shifters .",
    "as far as those phases are not identical , by a linear combination of the multiple phase shifter outputs we can rotate and scale @xmath67 even with large phase imbalances . assuming @xmath68 taps and @xmath69 phase shifters per tap , @xmath70-th phase shifter output at @xmath16-th tap can be written as    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is phase shifter gain to represent amplitude imbalance , and @xmath73 , which can be modeled as @xmath74 , is phase shift including phase imbalance @xmath75",

    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath82 can be written as    @xmath84    and @xmath85 respectively . since implementing wiener filter in analogue domain",
    "is quite difficult if not impossible , it is desirable to design techniques which are implementable in analogue domain . for this end",

    "since it is quite noisy estimation due to random signal @xmath12 , noise and impairments which will be discussed in next subsection , the noisy estimation is low - pass filtered by integrator with small step - size @xmath87 as shown in ( [ lms ] ) .",
    "together with , leads to the block diagram of the adaptive echo cancellation in analogue domain shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_blk ] .",
    "note that the multipliers in the outputs of phase shifters are in fact variable attenuators since the magnitudes of weights can be limited to less than 1 by design .",
    "also notice that as the step - size @xmath87 is much less than 1 , it can be implemented by a fixed attenuator .",
    "overall , it is quite clear that the proposed structure is implementable .",
    "unfortunately , however , @xmath90 and @xmath91 can not be obtained due to phase noise , phase / amplitude imbalances in downconverter . with unknown phase error @xmath92 and @xmath93 in in - phase and quadrature phase",
    "respectively , and unknown gains of @xmath94 and @xmath95 in in - phase and quadrature phase respectively , following signal has to be used    @xmath96    where @xmath97 represents imaginary part and @xmath98 is phase noise .",
    "similarly , we can define @xmath99 .",
    "in addition , although all downconverters are driven by the same oscillator , each downconverter may have different phase rotation .",

    "next , the effect of phase distortion in the variable attenuator is investigated . in wideband variable",

    "thus the second term in the right - hand side of is changed to    @xmath104    as in @xcite , the phase distortion can be modeled as a linear function of attenuation in log scale .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath105 and @xmath106 phase rotations at 3 db and 38 db attenuations respectively leads to    @xmath107    the additional phase rotation due to the phase distortion in the attenuator can be absorbed in @xmath101 .",
    "the phase distortion is large when the attenuation is large .",
    "however , when the attenuation is large , its contribution to echo estimation is small .",
    "thus , the phase distortion at high attenuation can be ignored .",
    "the values of above mentioned impairments are unknown . hence , we do not take any attempt to compensate those impairments in our study .",
    "simply , the outputs of downconverters which include all those impairments are used to train the weights .",
    "although the second terms in the right hand side of and are quite different due to impairments , as far as the signs of the second terms are same , the adaptive technique can converge as explained in appendix b. this is why the proposed method exhibits immunity to impairments unlike open loop techniques .",
    "the fixed phase shifter , combiner , splitter and coupler are quite linear components . in @xcite ,",
    "the input third order intercept point ( iip3 ) of the variable attenuator is 50 dbm which means with 0 dbm input power non - linear distortion power can be less than -100 dbm .",
    "hence , 0 dbm input power at the variable attenuator is maintained .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     however , one difficulty in solving this optimization problem is the lack of a well - known cost function that can capture gains in cell edge and cell average in both dl and ul . in general different cost functions",

    "it can be seen from table v that more than 100% of gain in dl cell average capacity can be achieved by str with null forming in both 8 and 12 antennas and decent gain in cell edge with 12 antennas .",
    "the gains beyond 100% in cell average come from the reduction of dl co - channel interference due to null forming .",
    "however , since ul is less interference limited , the gain is smaller .",

    "next , let us consider the case where ue - ue interference is more dominant than dl co - channel interference _ i.e. _ small cell with small @xmath108 .",
    "as it can be observed from table vi , without addressing ue - ue interference , cell edge users experience serious loss in dl capacity .",
    "nevertheless , by employing the proposed resource block structure and optimizing above cost function , positive gains can be achieved with str and 12 antennas by sacrificing ul capacity as shown in table vii .    although we assumed that each ue uses the whole bandwidth for time division multiplexing ( tdm ) , it is possible to allocate fraction of bandwidth to each ue for frequency division multiplexing ( fdm ) .",

    "<S> full duplex or simultaneous transmission and reception ( str ) in the same frequency at the same time can potentially double the physical layer capacity . </S>",
    "<S> however , high power transmit signal will appear at receive chain as echoes with powers much higher than the desired received signal . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to achieve the potential gain , it is imperative to cancel these echoes . </S>",
    "<S> as these high power echoes can saturate low noise amplifier ( lna ) and also digital domain echo cancellation requires unrealistically high resolution analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) , the echoes should be cancelled or suppressed sufficiently before lna . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a closed - loop echo cancellation technique which can be implemented purely in analogue domain . </S>",
    "<S> the advantages of our method are multiple - fold : it is robust to phase noise , does not require additional set of antennas , can be applied to wideband signals and the performance is irrelevant to radio frequency ( rf ) impairments in transmit chain . </S>",
    "<S> next , we study a few protocols for str systems in carrier sense multiple access ( csma ) network and investigate mac level throughput with realistic assumptions in both single cell and multiple cells . </S>",
    "<S> we show that str can reduce hidden node problem in csma network and produce gains of up to 279% in maximum throughput in such networks . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , at high traffic load , the gain of str system can be tremendously large since the throughput of non - str system is close to zero at heavy traffic due to severe collisions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate the application of str in cellular systems and study two new unique interferences introduced to the system due to str , namely _ bs - bs interference _ and _ ue - ue interference_. we show that these two new interferences will hugely degrade system performance if not treated appropriately . </S>",
    "<S> we propose novel methods to reduce both interferences and investigate the performances in system level . </S>",
    "<S> we show that bs - bs interference can be suppressed sufficiently enough to be less than thermal noise power , and with favorable ue - ue channel model , capacities close to double are observed both in downlink ( dl ) and uplink ( ul ) . </S>",
    "<S> when ue - ue interference is larger than dl co - channel interferences , we propose a simple and  non - cooperative \" technique in order to reduce ue - ue interference .    </S>",
