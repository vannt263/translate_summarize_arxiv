    "it is well known that hermitian operators have real eigenvalues and are therefore used to construct physically meaningful objects . however , the converse is not true .",
    "an operator having real eigenvalues need not necessarily be hermitian .",
    "this fact gained prominence over the last decade when it was realised that consistent quantisation is possible with nonhermitian hamiltonians if the theory is @xmath0 symmetric @xcite . @xmath0 symmetric theories are not merely of academic interest .",
    "they have appeared in the study of experimental systems in diverse fields e.g in superconductivity , quantum optics etc @xcite and very recently , in optical microcavities .",
    "optical microcavities have been the subject of many experimental and theoretical research in recent times .",
    "an important class of such systems has been branded as the whispering- gallery microresonators ( wgmr ) @xcite .",
    "very recently an interesting experiment has been performed with a coupled system of wgmrs having balanced loss and gain @xcite .",
    "the importance of the experiment is related to the fact that it implements a classical analogue of quantum systems described by non hermitian @xmath0 symmetric hamiltonians .",
    "the experiment also demonstrates phase transition from @xmath0 symmetry breaking phase to @xmath0 symmetric phase .",
    "these results have been discussed theoretically by bender et al @xcite who considered a coupled system of one - dimensional oscillators with balanced loss and gain . specifically , it was shown that for a particular value of coupling , there is an onset of equilibrium between the oscillators .",
    "intense research over the last decade has shown that sensible quantum theories with non - hermitian hamiltonians can be constructed @xcite .",
    "a new quantum theory of the damped harmonic oscillator ( dho ) was constructed by the present authors @xcite which is based on the property @xmath1 , where @xmath2 hermitian adjoint of a complex operator @xmath3 by @xmath4 and name it to be @xmath5 hermitian when @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonians considered in @xcite are @xmath5 hermitian . ]",
    "the classical system discussed there consisted of the dho and its time reversed image @xcite . interestingly ( though not accidentally ) , this doublet is just the system considered in @xcite in the limit of zero coupling .",
    "this suggests that similar techniques that were developed in @xcite may be employed in the context of the coupled wgmr experiment @xcite .",
    "taking another step forward , the elementary modes identified in @xcite may be utilised to describe the interaction between the coupled oscillators .",
    "this yields a new insight on the phase transitions mentioned in the beginning .",
    "this may facilitate the construction of a quantum theory of the coupled system .",
    "in this paper we have provided an alternative approach to the problem providing novel results and fresh insights .",
    "we have explicitly constructed the lagrangian that corresponds to the coupled system of oscillators given in @xcite .",
    "this lagrangian is shown to be a composite of two @xmath5 hermitian model lagrangians .",
    "such an analysis for zero coupling was earlier done by us @xcite . in that limit one of the elementary modes",
    "gives an exponentially growing solution and can thus be identified with the gain mode .",
    "the other mode is the loss mode .",
    "as energy is pumped into the system the gain mode is excited and due to the coupling with the loss mode , energy dissipation takes place .",
    "the coupling results in mode mixing which changes the effective parameters of the elementary modes .",
    "the whole equilibrium process may thus be understood in terms of the energy sharing between the elementary modes .",
    "these modes correspond to the pair of microresonators in the wgmr experiment .",
    "the isolated modes are @xmath5 hermitian but not @xmath0 - invariant .",
    "only the composite system is @xmath0 - symmetric .",
    "thus until the coupling is stabilized the system is in @xmath0 - symmetry breaking phase .",
    "the value of the coupling at which equilibrium is attained , or there is a phase transition from the broken @xmath0 - symmetry to an unbroken one , is obtained from purely analytic means and reproduces earlier findings @xcite .",
    "the organaisation of the paper is as follows : in section ii we present the whispering- gallery model @xcite .",
    "some new results are given here pertaining to the issue of symmetry .",
    "in section iii the elementary modes of the wgmrs are constructed . using the soldering method geared for chiral oscillators",
    "@xcite it is shown that the composite model constructed from these basic modes is just the coupled model of @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion pertaining to the elementary modes have been written and their implications are discussed .",
    "elements of the hamiltonian analysis are provided in this section . in section",
    "iv the qualitative nature of the motion of the combined system is analysed which also explains the phase transitions .",
    "section v contains our conclusions .",
    "we begin with a review of the model of @xcite which represents the coupled whispering- gallery microresonators ( wgmr ) .",
    "the equations of motion of the coupled system are @xmath7 the physical system consists of two directly coupled microtoroidal whispering- gallery mode resonators @xcite with balanced loss and gain @xcite . the first oscillator ( the one with loss ) is represented by @xmath8 whereas the second gain oscillator is represented by @xmath9 . the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are independent of time . also observe that the same parameter @xmath10 occurs in both the equations signifying balanced loss and gain .",
    "the special case @xmath12 is the uncoupled motion of the two oscillators that corresponds to bateman s doublet consisting of a damped harmonic oscillator ( dho ) and its time reversed image @xcite which has been analysed in a novel way in the recent past @xcite .",
    "we will have more occasions to refer to this uncoupled limit .",
    "for now let us note that if the ratio @xmath13 is greater than one , the free motion of the dho is oscillatory with exponentially decaying amplitude . otherwise , the motion is nonoscillatory i.e. overdamped @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of the system ( [ d1 ] ) can be constructed by the inverse lagrangian method @xcite .",
    "first we write the variation of the action as @xmath14                            \\label{7}\\ ] ] from ( [ 7 ] ) , the first equation of ( [ d1 ] ) is obtained by varying @xmath15 with respect to @xmath9 whereas the second equation of the set follows from varying @xmath15 with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "since the equations of motion for @xmath8 and @xmath9 follow as euler - lagrange equations for @xmath9 and @xmath8 respectively , this method is called the indirect method .",
    "now , starting from ( [ 7 ] ) we can deduce @xmath16                            \\label{8}\\ ] ] it is then possible to identify the lagrangian of the system as @xmath17 where @xmath8 coordinate and @xmath9 coordinate represent the loss and gain wgmrs . either under parity @xmath18 , @xmath19 or under time reversal @xmath20 which enforces @xmath21 the theory is not invariant .",
    "however , invariance is achieved under the combined operation @xmath0 . for the following analysis",
    "it will be advantageous to introduce the hyperbolic coordinates @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite where , @xmath24 using these hyperbolic coordinates the lagrangian ( [ n ] ) can be written in a compact notation as @xmath25 where the pseudo - eucledian metric @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 = -@xmath28 = 1 and @xmath29 = 0 . under @xmath0 @xmath30 naturally , the lagrangian ( [ l2 ] ) is also @xmath0 symmetric .    at this point",
    "one should note an important aspect of the problem . without the coupling term ( i.e",
    "when @xmath31 ) the bidimensional oscillator system ( [ d1 ] ) is invariant under the @xmath32 transformation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the first pauli matrix and @xmath35 is an infinitesmal parameter .",
    "the introduction of the coupling term breaks this invariance .",
    "the stronger the coupling , more pronounced is the symmetry breaking .    before finishing this section it will be appropriate to write the hamiltonian following from ( [ l2 ] ) .",
    "it is given below @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the canonical momenta , conjugate to @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "note the difference of the effect of coupling in different degrees of freedom . when @xmath39 the last term changes sign signifying a qualitative change in the behaviour of the system .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ l2 ] ) ( in conformity with ( [ n ] ) ) is not invariant under parity .",
    "thus the elementary modes of the wgmrs must be one dimensional yet planar oscllators with opposite sense of rotation. these basic modes will now be explicitly constructed .",
    "they bear a striking resemblance to chiral oscillators that have been utilised in the literature in connection with the landau problem @xcite , the dho problem @xcite etc .",
    "in fact the model ( [ l2 ] ) passes to the dho problem in the limit @xmath40 .",
    "the resolution of the dho in terms of complex lagrangians in the underdamped regime was of great use in the analysis of the model @xcite .",
    "similar reduction of ( [ l2 ] ) will now be discussed .",
    "this will enable one to understand the mechanism of the interactions between the microresonators and will be useful for future investigations .",
    "accordingly we introduce the lagrangian doublet @xmath41 where , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are as yet undetermined constants .",
    "the synthesis of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is now done by the soldering formalism . due to the presence of the constraints both @xmath47",
    "have one degree of freedom each .",
    "they may be suitably combined to yield the lagrangian ( [ l2 ] ) which has two degrees of freedom .",
    "we start from a simple sum @xmath48 substituting @xmath47 from ( [ 12 ] ) we get @xmath49 the essence of the soldering procedure can be understood in the following way .",
    "use @xmath50 in @xmath51 to eliminate @xmath52 so that @xmath53\\nonumber\\\\          & - & \\frac{k_-}{2}g_{ij}\\left[y_i y_j - y_i x_j - x_i y_j + x_i x_j\\right ]           + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\left[-2y_i{x}_i   + x_i{x}_i\\right ]          \\label{sn5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since there is no kinetic term for @xmath54 it is really an auxiliary variable . eliminating @xmath54 from @xmath55 by using its equation of motion we directly arrive at @xmath56",
    "if we make the following identification @xmath57 the lagrangian ( [ l2s ] ) goes over to ( [ l2 ] ) .",
    "note that the opposite sign of the kinetic term of the elementary lagrangians is crucial in the cancellation of the time derivative of @xmath9 in ( [ sn5 ] ) which in turn is instrumental in the success of the soldering method .",
    "the identification ( [ id1 ] ) has an immediate consequence .",
    "the ratio ( [ r ] ) is found to be , @xmath58^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\label{28}\\ ] ] different situations may arise depending on the coefficients @xmath43 . for real @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "hence in this case the parameters identified by ( [ id1 ] ) correspond to an aperiodic motion of the free oscillators .",
    "also note that for consistency of the first and third relations of ( [ id1 ] ) we require @xmath59 and @xmath60 to be of opposite sign , with a suitable choice of their absolute values . finally , @xmath62 is required for positive @xmath10 , .",
    "we first consider the physically more important situation where the parameters of ( [ l2 ] ) must be such that the ratio @xmath63 .",
    "as already observed in the preceding paragraph this condition can not be simulated by the identification ( [ id1 ] ) for real values of @xmath43 . however , if @xmath59 and @xmath60 are continued to complex values so that @xmath64 and @xmath65^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\label{32}\\ ] ] then clearly @xmath66 , which is the required condition for oscillatory motion",
    ". now equation ( [ id1 ] ) gives @xmath67 we express @xmath68 as @xmath69 with @xmath70 positive .",
    "the relations ( [ 33 ] ) give @xmath71 .",
    "we find that @xmath72 i.e @xmath42 must be purely imaginary .",
    "again , using this value of @xmath42 in ( [ 33 ] ) we get @xmath73 note that there are two arbitrary real positive parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the above . to simplify the expressions we put @xmath76 here @xmath77",
    "is kept explicit to show the effect of coupling . substituting ( [ 31 ] ) and ( [ 34 ] ) in ( [ 12 ] ) we get the elementary modes @xmath78 the soldered form of which is the lagrangian ( [ l2 ] ) pertaining to the oscillatory limit .",
    "evidently @xmath45 and @xmath46 are a complex conjugated pair .",
    "several comments are due about the modes ( [ ln1 ] , [ ln2 ] ) .",
    "first , they are first order planar lagrangians .",
    "there are two second class constraints which reduce the number of degrees of freedom by 2 in the phase space .",
    "thus notwithstanding the fact that it is a two coordinate system , the number of degrees of freedom ( in configuration space ) is one .",
    "next , these components satisfy @xmath79 under @xmath80 .",
    "this can be easily checked by using equations ( [ parity ] , [ tr ] and [ c3 ] ) .",
    "the result is consistent with the @xmath0 - symmetry of ( [ l2 ] ) . in the uncoupled limit",
    "these elementary modes carry opposite noether charges @xcite . since under @xmath0-symmetry @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the left handed oscillator switches to the right handed oscillator . the coupled motion may be viewed as interaction between the elementary modes of opposite handedness.    now it will be useful to derive the equations of motion from the lagrangians @xmath47 given by ( [ ln1 ] , [ ln2 ] ) . from @xmath45",
    "we can easily find the equations corresponding to @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively as @xmath83 from ( [ x2 ] ) we get @xmath84 substituting this in ( [ x1 ] ) we get the equation of motion for @xmath22 .",
    "thus we find that @xmath85 using the correspondence ( [ 33 ] ) this can be written in terms of the physical parameters @xmath11 , @xmath10 and @xmath77 as @xmath86x_i = 0 , i = 1,2 \\label{eom2}\\ ] ] similarly , the equations of motion from the lagrangians @xmath87 are @xmath88x_i = 0 , i = 1,2 \\label{eom3}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 note that both ( [ eom2 ] ) and ( [ eom3 ] ) can be written in a compact way as @xmath90 where , @xmath91\\label{w}\\ ] ] for @xmath92 it is not possible to write the square root of the rhs of ( [ w ] ) exactly as an elementary function of complex variables .",
    "thus the physical interpretation of the oscillations in the general case is difficult to obtain .",
    "however , such an interpretation is manifest in the uncoupled limit .",
    "going over to the @xmath40 we find that @xmath93 .",
    "one can then identify @xmath45 with the loss oscillator and @xmath46 with the gain oscillator .",
    "this observation will further be elaborated in the following section where an investigation of the coupled wgmrs is presented .",
    "it will be appropriate to write the hamiltonians corresponding to the lagrangans @xmath94 . from equation ( [ ln1 ] ) ) we can write @xmath45 as @xmath95 which is already in the first order form .",
    "the hamiltonian can thus be read off from ( [ ln11 ] ) as @xmath96 the canonical momentum conjugate to @xmath23 is @xmath97 after a canonical transformation ( ct ) @xmath98 this hamiltonian can be written as @xmath99 similarly , the hamiltonian corresponding to the lagrangian @xmath46 ( see equation ( [ ln2 ] ) ) can be written as @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the complex conjugates of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "it will be advantageous to express the hamiltonians ( [ hplus],[hminus ] ) in terms of the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath105 and @xmath77 . using the connections ( [ 34 ] )",

    "this reproduces the expected form of the hamiltonians of the modes with the frequency @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "the motion of the coupled system ( [ d1 ] ) has been analysed in their elementary modes in the above section . in the present section",
    "we will consider a situation where the coupled system is driven externally .",
    "this situation pertains to the coupled wgmrs experiment @xcite .",
    "indeed , the elementary modes ( [ ln1],[ln2 ] ) which are @xmath5 hermitian in isolation , will be identified as the coupled microcavities of the wgmr exeriment .",
    "our aim will be to find the conditions for equilibrium from a physical point of view , in terms of the elementary modes .    to understand the physical situation it will be useful to study the uncoupled case ( @xmath77 = 0 ) . from equation ( [ eom2 ] )",
    "we see that in this case the complex frequency is given by @xmath111 , where , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the corresponsing solution for @xmath22 in the complex form is @xmath114 . again using @xmath77 = 0 in ( [ eom11 ] ) and the relations @xmath115 and @xmath116 we get @xmath117 . taking the real parts we get @xmath118 together they form a right handed mode with loss .",
    "similarly the mode corresponding to @xmath46 is a left handed mode with gain since its solution involves ( @xmath119 ) instead of(@xmath120 ) .",
    "remember that these oscillatory modes are obtained when @xmath121 ( see equation ( [ r ] ) and the discussion below it ) .",
    "the limiting condition for the underdamped motion can be written in terms of the complex frequency as @xmath122 if this condition is not realised the oscillatory gain mode is not excited .",
    "we assume this to happen for zero coupling .",
    "thus the system of wgmrs behave as two oscillators in isolation . since the individual oscilators are not @xmath0 invariant , it is in the @xmath0 breaking phase ( see figure ( [ uc_plots ] ) ) .",
    "the coupling is now initiated by bringing the wgmrs close enough .",
    "when the coupling is very small the motion of the gain oscillator is still non oscillatory and it can not supply enough energy to the loss oscillator to establish stability . as the coupling is gradually increased a point comes when the motion of the gain oscillator begins .",
    "it then delivers the gained energy to the loss mode in a balanced way and equilibrium is attained ( see figure ( [ c_plots ] ) .",
    "unlike the uncoupled case we are unable to find the exact frequencies , but it is clear that the characteristic frequency will be modified by the coupling . due to the feedback to the gain oscillator the damping will also be modified .",
    "however for small coupling we can neglect the effect on damping .",
    "then , in analogy with ( [ aa1 ] ) we can define a condition that will dictate the onset of equilibrium . from ( [ hminuspm ] ) and ( [ aa1 ] ) this condition",
    "is given by @xmath123 i.e. @xmath124 squaring both sides and simplifying yields , @xmath125 ^ 2 = \\gamma^4 + \\epsilon^2 \\label{aa2}\\ ] ] where , at an intermediate step , @xmath126 has been eliminated in favour of @xmath11 by using ( [ x ] ) . the solution for @xmath105",
    "is now found by a perturbation expansion in powers of the coupling @xmath77 , @xmath127 subjected to the boundary condition that @xmath128 for @xmath31 . substituting ( [ p])in ( [ aa2 ] ) and retaining terms upto @xmath129(which corresponds to the leading approximation ) , yields the condition , @xmath130 that implies the onset of equilibrium .",
    "this condition was earlier obtained in @xcite by using a graphical technique to solve a quartic equation .",
    "now if the coupling strength @xmath77 is arbitrarily increased the point @xmath131 is reached .",
    "if @xmath77 exceeds this limit equation ( [ i2 ] ) shows that the coefficients of @xmath132 and @xmath133 have the same sign which qualitatively alters the structures of the oscillatory modes .",
    "the effective model is now bereft of the equilibration .",
    "the point @xmath131 thus gives an upper bound on the coupling strength for stable motion of the doublet .",
    "in this paper we have analysed a system of two coupled oscillators , one with gain and the other with loss . for",
    "the particular case of identical gain and loss parameters the system becomes pt - symmetric and is closely connected with recent experiments @xcite on whispering- gallery microcavities , a fact that was first noticed in @xcite .    in the absence of coupling the present system",
    "consists of a damped harmonic oscillator and its time reversed image .",
    "a method was developed by us @xcite , both in the lagrangian and hamiltonian formulations , to study such a model .",
    "specifically the elementary modes of this composite model were shown to be chiral oscillators rotating in opposite directions .",
    "chiral oscillators are basically simple harmonic oscillators with a preferred sense of rotation or ` chirality ' .",
    "the nontrivial ingredient now is the presence of coupling .",
    "however this fact was incorporated here and , with suitable modifications , we were able to construct the elementary modes .",
    "these modes were a pair of oscillators but their chirality gets smeared due to mode mixing brought about by the coupling .    a pt - symmetrical picture of the experiment on whispering- gallery microresonators emerged .",
    "in the absence of coupling , the elementary modes are the pair of chiral oscillators with opposite chirality , signifying loss and gain .",
    "these may be identified with the pair of microresonators with loss and gain .",
    "the individual lagrangians of the elementary modes are @xmath5 hermitian but not pt - symmetric . however , the composite system has @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "thus when the oscillators are isolated there is no pt - symmetry . as the coupling is switched on there is mode mixing between the basic oscillators .",
    "if the coupling is very small , the oscillatory condition of the gain mode is not attained so that there is no equilibrium .",
    "on increasing the coupling , there is a definite value when the oscillations commence and there is a balanced loss and gain .",
    "this signals the onset of equilibrium .",
    "the particular coupling where equilibrium is attained was found by using analytic techniques and reproduced the results obtained by a graphical analysis @xcite . at this point",
    "the composite lagrangian ( [ l2 ] ) has pt - symmetry .",
    "this implies a phase transition from a broken pt- symmetric phase to an unbroken one .",
    "if the coupling is further increased , then there is a definite value where the oscillatory mode dies out and equilibrium is lost .",
    "this is the second phase transition point where an unbroken pt - symmetric phase passes over to a broken one .",
    "this second point also agreed with previous results @xcite .",
    "the success of our analysis depends on the lagrangian method .",
    "if we have a coupled set of loss oscillators then it is not possible to use the inverse lagrangian method to construct the lagrangian of the system as we have done in ( [ n ] ) from ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the problem of damped harmonic oscillator ( dho ) where we need to supplement the dho by another oscillator which absorbs the dissipated energy @xcite .",
    "it may be interesting to see whether , by invoking the bateman doublet for each of the loss oscillators , it is possible to form a conservative system and apply our method to find out the exceptional points .    to sum up , we were able to provide a physical picture of the wgmr experiments .",
    "it was based on a suitable extension of the method developed by us @xcite to discuss uncoupled oscillators with balanced loss and gain .",
    "we also feel that the methods initiated in @xcite and further developed here may be useful to analyse other pt - symmetry related phenomena ( a good set of such references may be found in @xcite ) based on chirality .",
