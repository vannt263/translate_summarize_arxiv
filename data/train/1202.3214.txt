    "the recent discovery of the compound nigas@xmath5 , and the suggestion that it might be a spin liquid or a spin nematic , @xcite has revived the interest in the heisenberg model with bilinear and biquadratic interactions defined by the hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 stands for nearest neighbor pairs on a lattice . in one dimension",
    ", the spin-1 case has been very thoroughly investigated following haldane s prediction that the pure heisenberg model is gapped,@xcite and a rather complete picture of its properties has emerged both in zero ( see e.g. refs .  [ ] and references therein ) and in finite magnetic field.@xcite    in two dimensions , most of the attention has also been devoted to the spin-1 case , and some trends have emerged from the investigation of this model on the triangular and square lattices . @xcite with the standard notation @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the phase diagram as a function of @xmath10 consists of four main phases : an antiferromagnetic phase ( with two sublattices on the square lattice and three sublattices on the triangular lattice ) around @xmath11 , followed counter - clockwise by a three - sublattice antiferroquadrupolar phase up to @xmath12 , a ferromagnetic phase around @xmath13 , and finally a ferroquadrupolar phase that persists until the antiferromagnetic order sets in .    in comparison , little attention has been paid to the classical limit , where spins are classical vectors of length @xmath14 .",
    "the main reason lies in the fact that , unlike for spin-1/2 models , in the spin-1 case the classical limit is not equivalent to the hartree approximation ( in which the ground state is approximated by a product of local wave functions ) since local wave functions are not necessarily purely magnetic but can also describe quadrupolar states .    in the classical limit",
    ", the most unusual feature introduced by the presence of the biquadratic exchange is the possibility ( realized in the parameter range with @xmath15 ) to have the minimum of the interaction of two spins in a _ noncollinear _",
    "configuration in which they make an angle @xmath16 with respect to each other , while the overall orientation of the spins is arbitrary .",
    "@xcite such an interaction may be called a _ rotationally invariant spin - canting interaction_. it should not be confused with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , which also induces a canting between a pair of spins but forces them to lie in a specific plane .",
    "note that the physics will be essentially the same for any rotationally invariant canting interaction between pairs of spins that leads to the same angle @xmath17 , for instance interactions that include higher powers of @xmath18 , in which case the relation ( [ eq : phi ] ) would have to be replaced by a more complex one .",
    "for this reason we prefer below to characterize the interaction in terms of the angle @xmath17 and not in terms of the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the classical xy model with rotationally invariant spin - canting interaction on the square lattice has been investigated by lee _",
    "_ @xcite and the classical heisenberg model on the triangular lattice by kawamura and yamamoto .",
    "@xcite    according to ref .",
    ", the zero - temperature phase diagram of the classical version of model [ eq : hbb ] on the triangular lattice includes four phases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_phase_diagram_circle ] ) : a ferromagnetic phase for @xmath19 , a nematic - like phase with collinear orientation of spins for @xmath20 , a three - sublattice antiferromagnetic phase for @xmath21 , and a phase with non - coplanar orientations of spins for .",
    "this phase diagram is reminiscent of the spin-1 phase diagram , but the non - degenerate ferro- and antiferroquadrupolar phases of the spin-1 case are replaced by highly degenerate magnetic phases . the nematic - like phase is thoroughly discussed in ref .  , with the conclusion that it has the same degeneracy and correlations as the antiferromagnetic ising model on the triangular lattice .",
    "@xmath22     the discussion of the non - coplanar phase is much more sketchy however .",
    "the authors point out that there is a degeneracy due to the two possible chiralities of a local umbrella [ formed on each triangular plaquette when @xmath23 , but no attempt has been made to identify the structure of the ground state manifold or to study the consequences of the degeneracy on the spin correlations in a typical ground state . in the present paper , we construct the complete classification of the ground states which allows us to conclude that the non - coplanar phase is a non - trivial one even at zero temperature because the total number of ground states grows exponentially with the area of the system , as in various versions of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) potts model and other frustrated models with a finite residual entropy per site .",
    "@xcite in situations like this , it is not evident _ a priori _ whether the degeneracy leads at zero temperature to the disordering of the system or to an algebraic decay of correlations , or whether long - range order is nevertheless present .",
    "interestingly enough , in the two - dimensional antiferromagnets known to have an extensive residual entropy , all three scenarios are realized .",
    "in particular , both the af ising model on the _ kagom _ lattice @xcite and the three - state af potts model on the square lattice",
    "@xcite at zero temperature are disordered , the af ising model on the triangular lattice @xcite and the three - state af potts model on the _ kagom _ lattice @xcite are critical , whereas the three - state af potts model on the dice lattice has a genuine long - range order .",
    "@xcite the main aim of our paper is to establish which of the three scenarios is realized in the present case .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ grstates ] is devoted to a complete classification of the ground states of the model in terms of the nonintersecting closed loops living on the bonds of the triangular lattice , which allows us to redefine the problem as a loop model . in sec .",
    "[ o(n ) ] we show that the order - parameter manifold of this loop model has the same topology as that of the @xmath24 model with @xmath25 , which suggests that they belong to the same universality class and , therefore , that both of them are in the ordered phase . in sec .",
    "[ potts ] , the same conclusion is confirmed by establishing a relation with the four - state af potts model on the same lattice and by relying on some known properties of this potts model . for completeness ,",
    "[ pi/2 ] briefly discusses the case , where the model is trivially exactly solvable , and sec .",
    "[ concl ] summarizes the results .",
    "appendix [ rproblem ] is devoted to the analysis of a simplified problem corresponding to freezing the spins on one of the three sublattices in a perfectly ordered state .",
    "it also includes estimates from below and from above of the residual entropy of the full problem .",
    "we assume that classical spins @xmath26 ( three - dimensional vectors of unit length ) are located at the sites @xmath27 of the triangular lattice and that the energy of the interaction of two neighboring spins @xmath28 depends only on the angle between @xmath29 and @xmath30 and is minimal when this angle is equal to @xmath31 . in terms of the coupling constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hbb ] ) this corresponds to ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : phi ] ) . for such values of @xmath17",
    ", it turns out to be possible to minimize @xmath34 simultaneously for all pairs of neighboring spins @xmath35 , which means that the system is not frustrated .",
    "however , as we shall see , it is very highly degenerate .",
    "the simplest ground states of the model can be constructed by choosing three unit vectors @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 which form angles @xmath17 with respect to each other .",
    "after that , one can partition the triangular lattice into three triangular sublattices ( denoted below a , b , and c ) and set all spins on sublattice a to @xmath36 , on sublattice b to @xmath37 and on the third one to @xmath38 .",
    "in such a way , one obtains a periodic ground state which has a three - sublattice structure .",
    "@xcite below we call such ground states regular states",
    ".    the family of regular states is characterized by an @xmath39 degeneracy , where the group @xmath40 is related to the possibility of simultaneously rotating all spins and the group @xmath41 to the possibility of choosing the sign of the mixed product of the three spins located in the corners of a given plaquette to be either positive or negative .",
    "however , it is clear that the family of ground states is much wider than the set of regular states , and that , in addition to these two symmetry - induced degeneracies , it possesses also an infinite set of discrete degeneracies not related to global symmetries .",
    "indeed , for any pair of spins @xmath42 and @xmath43 forming an angle @xmath44 with respect to each other there are always two possibilities to choose the orientation of the third spin in such a way that it forms the same angle @xmath17 both with @xmath36 and with @xmath37 .",
    "these two orientations are mirror images of each other with respect to the plane formed by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "since in a regular state all plaquettes contain the same triad of spins ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , it is clear that in such a state one can always flip an arbitrary spin into its mirror image without increasing the energy of the system .    flipping one spin leads to a new ground state in which six neighboring triangular plaquettes ( surrounding the flipped spin ) form a domain of a different regular state . in order to obtain a larger domain",
    ", one has to flip other spins belonging to the same sublattice .",
    "as soon as a domain of another regular state is sufficiently large , a new domain can be formed inside it by flipping spins belonging to another sublattice , and so on .",
    "a convenient method of describing the full set of ground states is based on the notion of a zero - energy domain wall .",
    "@xcite in the system under consideration , a zero - energy domain wall can be defined as a line passing through the bonds of the triangular lattice in such a way that each segment of this line separates two plaquettes corresponding to different regular states .",
    "this means that each segment of such a wall separates two unparallel spins which on the original triangular lattice are next - to - nearest neighbors and therefore belong to the same sublattice .",
    "then it is clear that the spin configuration in a ground state is uniquely defined as soon as one specifies the orientations of three spins on an arbitrary plaquette and the positions of all zero - energy domain walls . for brevity , in the following we simply call these objects domain walls .    by definition , a regular state contains no domain walls , whereas flipping of a single spin leads to the formation of the simplest closed domain wall consisting of six segments joining each other at angle @xmath45 , i.e. a hexagon . by flipping a larger number of spins belonging to the same sublattice",
    "one can construct more complex domain walls .",
    "however , it is clear that any wall has to be closed ( or end at the boundary ) and its neighboring segments always have to form angles of @xmath46 with respect to each other , as in fig .",
    "[ fig - v](b ) .    , ( e ) the vertex corresponding to an intersection of loops ( allowed only at @xmath4 ) .",
    "the domain walls on different sublattices are shown with lines of different types.,width=283 ]    since each domain wall can be associated with spin - flipping on a particular sublattice of the triangular lattice , all domain walls can be partitioned into three classes ( which below are called colors ) .",
    "the domain walls of a given color live on one of the three equivalent honeycomb sublattices into which the bonds of the triangular lattice can be partitioned .",
    "therefore , just by construction walls of the same color have no possibility of crossing or touching each other .     with respect to the original one .",
    ", width=321 ]    a less evident property is that for a generic value of @xmath17 walls of different colors are also unable to cross each other .",
    "this is so because when going around an intersection of two walls [ see fig .",
    "[ fig - v](e ) ] one has to perform successive spin flips on sublattice @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 ) , then on another sublattice @xmath49 and once again on @xmath47 and then on @xmath49 , and return after that to the same configuration . at a formal level",
    ", this corresponds to the fulfillment of the condition @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the operation of spin - flipping on sublattice @xmath47 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "however , since each of the operators @xmath51 and @xmath53 involves a rotation of a spin around the third spin of the triad by the angle @xmath54 , where @xmath55 the application of @xmath56 rotates the whole configuration by @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to check that one returns to the initial configuration only for @xmath4 ( when @xmath58 is also equal to @xmath59 ) , whereas for all other values of @xmath17 the operator @xmath56 brings a triad of spins into a configuration rotated with respect to the original one , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - f ] .",
    "condition ( [ rarb ] ) can be also rewritten as @xmath60 , which means that the zero - energy domain walls can cross each other only when operators @xmath51 commute with each other .",
    "however , walls of different colors can touch each other , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - v](c ) .    as a consequence of the rules discussed above , for each site of the triangular lattice",
    "there are only three possibilities : ( i ) the absence of any domain wall passing through this site [ see fig .",
    "[ fig - v](a ) ] , ( ii ) the presence of a single domain wall whose segments form an angle @xmath45 with each other [ see fig . [ fig - v](b ) ] and ( iii ) the presence of two domain walls touching each other [ see fig . [ fig - v](c ) ] . therefore ,",
    "to understand the zero - temperature properties of the system , one has to study a loop model on the triangular lattice in which on each site only the configurations shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - v](a)-(c ) are allowed ( as well of course as those that can be obtained from them by rotation ) , whereas all other configurations are prohibited [ for example , the intersection of two domain walls shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - v](e ) ] .",
    "the two exceptions where other configurations of zero - energy domain walls are allowed are the cases @xmath2 and @xmath4 , discussed respectively in sec .",
    "[ potts ] and sec .",
    ".    one can introduce on each triangular plaquette @xmath61 a binary variable @xmath62 defined in such a way that it is perfectly ordered in any regular ground state and changes its sign on crossing each domain wall . in terms of the original spin variables",
    "@xmath63 the value of @xmath64 is given by the sign of the mixed product @xmath65 $ ] , where the three sites @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 belonging to plaquette @xmath69 are labelled after the sublattice to which they belong .",
    "below for simplicity we call variable @xmath64 chirality of plaquette @xmath69 , although more accurately it should be called staggered chirality .",
    "let us define neighboring regular states as regular states which can be transformed into each other by flipping the spins of one of the three sublattices . from the definition of a domain wall",
    "it is clear that in any ground state the domains lying on both sides of any domain wall belong to neighboring regular states .",
    "since each regular state has exactly three neighboring states , at zero temperature the order - parameter manifold of our system has the topology of an infinite cayley tree ( also known as bethe lattice ) with coordination number @xmath25 .",
    "each node of this tree represents a regular ground state , while the links connect neighboring states .",
    "if one ascribes to each link on the tree the color of the corresponding domain wall , the three links connecting any node with its neighbors will all be of different colors .",
    "[ fig_loops ] illustrates the correspondence between the domains of various regular states and the nodes of the cayley tree whose links are colored in such a way . on the top panel ,",
    "the domains corresponding to the same regular state are marked by the same number ( the numbering being arbitrary ) .",
    "on the bottom panel , the same set of numbers is used to mark the nodes of the cayley tree .",
    "the distance on the tree corresponds to the minimal number of spin flips one has to make ( in other terms , the minimal number of domain walls one has to cross ) to get from one regular state to another .",
    "the tree - like topology of the order - parameter manifold ( that is , the absence of closed loops ) is ensured by the impossibility ( for a generic value of @xmath17 ) to return to the same state after crossing a sequence of domain walls corresponding to a product of operators @xmath51 which can not be reduced to unity by application of the identity @xmath70 .",
    "this property follows from the fact that intersections of domain walls are not allowed .        another model with the same structure of the order - parameter manifold",
    "is obtained when one considers a loop model on the honeycomb lattice @xcite in which each closed loop of length @xmath71 is ascribed a factor @xmath72 in this model the loops can not intersect or touch each other simply because the geometry of the honeycomb lattice does not allow for this .",
    "the number @xmath73 can then be interpreted as the number of different colors the loops can have .",
    "this allows one to interpret these colored loops as domain walls @xcite separating the states on a cayley tree with coordination number @xmath73 by following the same rule that the states separated by a domain wall of a given color correspond to neighboring nodes connected by a link of the same color .",
    "for @xmath25 the only difference between the two models is that in our model the loops of different colors are living on three different ( interpenetrating ) honeycomb lattices , whereas in the loop model of ref .",
    "they are living on the same honeycomb lattice .",
    "however in both models the loops can not cross each other or have an overlap , which ensures that the two models have the same order - parameter manifold and therefore can be expected to belong to the same universality class .    in ref .",
    "it has been shown that the loop model defined by eq .",
    "( [ w(l ) ] ) is a dual representation of a ferromagnetic @xmath24 model whose partition function can be written as @xmath74\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath75 are @xmath73-dimensional unit vectors defined at the sites @xmath69 of the honeycomb lattice , the product is taken over all bonds @xmath76 of this lattice and the trace implies the unweighted integration over all variables @xmath75 . on the other hand , it is also well known that in @xmath24 models with @xmath77 the long range order in @xmath75 is always destroyed by small continuous fluctuations of the order parameter ( the spin waves ) , @xcite which leads to an exponential decay of the correlation functions @xmath78 with the distance between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "it follows from the analysis of refs . and that in terms of the loop representation the exponential decay of @xmath81 means that the insertion into the system of a string ( an open loop ) going from @xmath79 to @xmath80 leads to the suppression of the partition function of the system by a factor which exponentially depends on the distance between @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this suggests that long loops have large effective free energy and accordingly the probability of finding a sufficiently large loop also decays exponentially with the size of this loop . as a consequence , the typical number of irreducible loops separating the two points can not experience an unrestricted growth with the increase of the distance between these points and has to saturate at some finite value .",
    "this means that in terms of the order parameter defined on a cayley tree the system is in the ordered phase , that is , it remains localized in some region of the order parameter manifold even when its size tends to infinity . from the universality",
    "we expect the loop model constructed in the previous section ( which has the same symmetry of the order - parameter manifold ) to be also in the ordered phase . in terms of original spin variables",
    "@xmath26 , such a situation corresponds to the existence of a genuine long - range order .",
    "this is especially evident for @xmath84 .",
    "it is clear that if in a typical ground state the system is localized on the tree within the region of diameter @xmath85 , then for @xmath86 the distant spins will be almost parallel to each other .",
    "to support the hypothesis that there should be no qualitative difference between the system in which the loops of different colors live on different sublattices and the one where they live on the same sublattice , we analyze in appendix [ rproblem ] a reduced problem with @xmath87 .",
    "in particular , we explicitly demonstrate that the system in which the non - intersecting loops of two different colors live on two interpenetrating honeycomb lattices can be in an exact way transformed into the system in which the loops of two different colors live on the same honeycomb lattice .",
    "when @xmath2 , different spins @xmath63 can have only four different orientations in any ground state , which means that at zero temperature the system is equivalent to the four - state af potts model .",
    "it has been shown in refs . and that the set of ground states of the four - state af potts model on the triangular lattice allows a mapping onto the set of ground states of the three - state af potts model on a _ kagom _ lattice ,",
    "whose exact solution at zero temperature was constructed by baxter in 1970 .",
    "@xcite his results imply that the four - state af potts model has a finite extensive entropy per site whose numerical value is approximately equal to @xmath88 .",
    "much later huse and rutenberg @xcite have demonstrated that baxter s solution corresponds to an algebraic decay of spin correlations on the same triangular sublattice of a _ kagom _ lattice : @xmath89 with @xmath90 , @xmath91 being the distance between @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( the application of the same approach shows that in terms of the four - state af potts model on the triangular lattice @xmath94 ) .",
    "this conclusion was reached by constructing another mapping @xcite which puts each ground state of the three - state af potts model on the _ kagom _ lattice into correspondence with a ground state of a solid - on - solid ( sos ) model describing fluctuations of a two - dimensional interface in a four - dimensional space . in this sos model height variables",
    "@xmath95 ( defined on the sites @xmath27 of the original triangular lattice @xmath96 ) are points on an auxiliary triangular lattice @xmath97 defined in the transverse ( height ) space .",
    "the only restriction on possible configurations of @xmath98 is that if @xmath27 and @xmath99 are nearest neighbors on @xmath100 , then @xmath101 and @xmath102 have to be nearest neighbors on @xmath97 .    to make the description of the system more transparent ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the locally coarse - grained heights @xmath103 $ ] , that is the averages of variables @xmath98 over the three sites belonging to a given triangular plaquette of @xmath100 .",
    "@xcite these variables can be considered as defined at the sites @xmath69 of the honeycomb lattice @xmath104 dual to @xmath100 , and their values belong to the honeycomb lattice @xmath105 dual to @xmath97 .",
    "variables @xmath106 are more convenient than variables @xmath101 because , in any regular state , all variables @xmath106 are equal ( in contrast to variables @xmath101 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "each domain wall separates @xmath106 and @xmath107 which are nearest neighbors on @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath69 and @xmath108 are nearest neighbors on @xmath104 , then @xmath106 and @xmath107 have to be either equal or nearest neighbors on @xmath105 .",
    "thus , for , different regular states can be associated with different points of @xmath105 , which means that the order - parameter manifold instead of being a cayley tree with coordination number @xmath25 ( as for generic values of @xmath17 ) has the topology of a periodic lattice with the same coordination number , namely , of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "@xcite on a formal level , this follows from the existence of the identity @xmath109 .",
    "this difference in the topology of the order - parameter manifold leads to a change of the universality class , and , instead of being long - ranged , the correlations are algebraic . in terms of the loop representation introduced in sec .",
    "[ grstates ] , a special feature of the case @xmath2 is that in addition to vertices @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( see fig . [ fig - v ] ) , the vertex @xmath113 shown in the same figure is also allowed ( with the same unitary weight as all other vertices ) .",
    "it is known from the analysis of ref .",
    "that the sos model corresponding to the potts model under consideration is in the rough phase , where the large scale fluctuations of @xmath114 can be described by a free field effective hamiltonian , @xmath115 however , the value of the dimensionless rigidity modulus @xmath116 is such that the perturbation responsible for the discreteness of @xmath117 is marginal . in other terms",
    ", the model is located exactly at the point of the roughening transition .",
    "therefore , any additional suppression of height fluctuations should drive the system into the ordered phase .",
    "in particular , we argue below that this happens when one suppresses the formation of vertices @xmath113 ( which for a generic value of @xmath17 are not allowed ) .    in terms of height variables",
    "@xmath118 the main property of the loop model defined by vertices @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 is that its order - parameter manifold does not allow for the existence of closed loops in the height space . as a consequence , when going around any of these vertices , the vector @xmath114 makes in the height space just a trivial loop that can be contracted to a point and has zero area .",
    "in contrast to that , when going around vertex @xmath113 the vector @xmath114 sweeps a loop whose area is equal to that of the elementary hexagon cell of @xmath105 .",
    "accordingly , in terms of height variables @xmath106 an interaction that keeps the weights of vertices @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 unchanged but leads to the partial or complete suppression of vertices @xmath113 can be written as @xmath119 where @xmath120 , @xmath121 is the area of a loop swept by @xmath114 when going counterclockwise around the hexagonal plaquette of the dual lattice surrounding site @xmath27 of the original lattice , and @xmath122 numbers ( in the same direction ) the six sites of the dual lattice belonging to this plaquette .",
    "naturally , complete suppression corresponds to @xmath123 .    in the framework of a continuous description , eq .",
    "( [ vd ] ) should be replaced by @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the two components of the vector @xmath127 and the quantity in brackets is the jacobian of the mapping @xmath128 .",
    "it seems natural to expect that the addition of such an interaction with @xmath120 to the large - scale hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) would lead to the suppression of the fluctuations of @xmath129 and indeed the perturbative treatment demonstrates that already in the first order of the expansion in powers of @xmath130 one obtains a correction to @xmath116 . for @xmath120",
    "this correction is positive and therefore has to shift the system into the ordered phase .",
    "this provides one more argument in favor of the conclusion that for a generic value of @xmath17 the system has to be in the ordered phase , which corresponds to the existence of a genuine long - range order in terms of the original spin variables @xmath63 .    however , the existence of such a long - range order does not necessarily imply the presence of the long range - order in chirality .",
    "even if in a typical configuration the system is localized in some region of the order - parameter manifold , its distribution does not have to be centered on a particular node of the order - parameter tree , but can also be , for example , symmetric with respect to the center of a link connecting two neighboring nodes .",
    "in such a case there will be no long - range order in chirality , although the original spin variables @xmath63 will be ordered on all three sublattices .",
    "in the case @xmath4 , the spins on neighboring sites always have to be perpendicular to each other ( where `` always '' means `` in any ground state '' ) . as a consequence",
    ", each spin always remains flippable independently of the flips made by other spins .",
    "in such a situation it is natural to describe the ground states of the system in terms of ising pseudospins @xmath131 such that @xmath132 , where @xmath133 denotes the sublattice to which site @xmath27 belongs and @xmath36 , @xmath134 , @xmath38 are three unit vectors perpendicular to each other .",
    "since all possible sets of @xmath135 are allowed , the residual entropy per site is equal to @xmath136 and the zero - temperature spin - spin correlation function @xmath137 vanishes as soon as @xmath138 .",
    "however , the system has long - range order in terms of the spin - nematic order parameter , @xmath139 , @xcite with three different easy axes ( which are perpendicular to each other ) for the three sublattices . in refs . and devoted to the investigation of model ( [ eq : hbb ] ) with @xmath140 , the phase with such a structure of the order parameter ( realized for @xmath141 ) was called the antiferroquadrupolar phase .",
    "the difference between the quantum system with @xmath140 and the classical limit , @xmath142 , is that for @xmath140 the order parameter on each sublattice is like in an easy - plane spin nematic , whereas for @xmath142 it is like in an easy - axis spin nematic .    as it was already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ grstates ] , in terms of the loop representation the case @xmath4 corresponds to the situation where the intersections of loops [ see fig . [ fig - v](e ) ] are not prohibited . in such a case , the three subsystems of loops ( on different sublattices )",

    "this conclusion has been confirmed by showing that our model can be constructed by imposing an additional restriction onto the four - state af potts model on the triangular lattice , which leads to the suppression of the fluctuations of the free field describing the large - scale fluctuations of this potts model and therefore pushes it from the point of roughening transition into the ordered phase .",
    "numerical simulations of the classical bilinear - biquadrartic heisenberg model on the triangular lattice demonstrate @xcite that at @xmath144 and very low temperatures the spins in a typical configuration form a non - collinear structure analogous to what can be expected from a typical ground state in the presence of weak continuous fluctuations .",
    "however , the authors of ref . have not studied how the spin - spin correlation functions behave in the @xmath145 limit ( at any finite temperature the long - range order in spin orientation in any case has to be destroyed by the spin waves @xcite ) , so their results can not be used for checking our conclusions .",
    "moreover , it still remains to be elucidated if the behavior of the system at very low temperatures is determined mostly by its zero - temperature properties , or whether the removal of the accidental degeneracy by continuous fluctuations ( spin waves ) can play an important role , as in the case of a heisenberg or xy antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "@xcite note that the only possibility for the non - collinear phase considered in this paper to have a genuine long - range order at finite temperatures consists in having a long - range order in chirality , and our conclusions allow for the realization of such a scenario .",
    "the two exceptions from the generic behavior described above are the cases @xmath4 and for which the model at zero temperature is exactly solvable .",
    "for @xmath4 the fluctuations of any pair of spins are uncorrelated , @xmath146 , but the system has long range order in terms of the spin - nematic order parameter with three different easy axes for the three sublattices ( the antiferroquadrupolar phase@xcite ) . on the other hand , for @xmath2",
    "the model is equivalent to the four - state af potts model , in which the chirality and spin correlations are algebraic , @xmath147 @xmath148 .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with sandro wenzel .",
    "this work was supported by the swiss national fund , by manep and by the hungarian otka grant no .",

    "let us consider a `` reduced '' loop problem which differs from the one formulated in sec .",
    "[ grstates ] by the suppression of the formation of loops on one of the three honeycomb sublattices .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the spins on one of the three triangular sublattices are not allowed to flip and remain aligned in the same direction ( below this sublattice is denoted @xmath149 and two other sublattices @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) . in such a situation , the formation of loops on the honeycomb lattice @xmath152 formed by the sites of @xmath150 and @xmath151 is impossible and the loop system consists of only two types of loops ( on honeycomb lattices @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) .",
    "when all spins on @xmath149 point in the same direction , @xmath155 , the orientation of spins on the two other sublattices ( @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) can be described by a single variable @xmath156 , the angle between the projection of @xmath63 on the plane perpendicular to @xmath157 and some reference direction in this plane . since the angle between neighboring spins is always equal to @xmath17 , the difference between the values of @xmath156 on neighboring sites of @xmath158 has to be equal ( modulo @xmath159 ) to @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is given by eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) . for @xmath0",
    ", @xmath161 belongs to the interval @xmath162 and is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath17 .    for @xmath163 ( that is , @xmath164 ) ,",
    "the existence of such a relation between the orientations of neighboring spins allows one to introduce integer variables @xmath165 defined on the sites of honeycomb lattice @xmath152 in such a way that on neighboring sites of @xmath152 ( belonging to different sublattices ) they always differ by @xmath166 .",
    "in particular , one can choose variables @xmath165 to be even on @xmath150 and odd on @xmath167 .",
    "then on neighboring sites of the same triangular sublattice these variables either differ by @xmath168 ( when these sites are separated by a domain wall ) or are equal to each other ( in the absence of such a wall ) .",
    "accordingly , the system of @xmath169 and @xmath170 loops can be discussed in terms of a @xmath171-dimensional solid - on - solid ( sos ) model defined on @xmath158 . in the sos representation ,",
    "variables @xmath165 have the meaning of surface heights , whereas each domain wall plays the role of a step between the regions in which the values of either @xmath172 or of @xmath173 differ by @xmath168 . the sos model defined in such a way",
    "can be considered as a generalization of the bcsos model ( introduced by van beijeren @xcite on the square lattice ) to the honeycomb lattice . in particular ,",
    "the representation of the model in terms of ising - type pseudospins can be constructed with the help of the same relations as for the bcsos model , @xcite      where we still follow the convention that variables @xmath175 are even on @xmath150 and odd on @xmath151 .",
    "the pseudospin variables @xmath135 are defined in such a way that each flip of the original spin @xmath176 leads to a change of sign of @xmath135 .",
    "accordingly , pseudospins of opposite signs belonging to the same sublattice are separated by domain walls .    all configurations allowed in this sos model",
    "enter the partition function of the reduced problem with the same weight ( like in the infinite temperature limit of the model ) .",
    "the existence of the mapping to a sos model confirms that the suppression of spin flips on one of the three sublattices reduces the order parameter manifold of the system from a tree with coordination number @xmath25 to a trivial tree with coordination number @xmath87 .",
    "the sos model on @xmath152 introduced above can be further mapped onto the 20-vertex model on the triangular lattice introduced by baxter .",
    "@xcite in order to perform the mapping , one should put on each bond of @xmath149 an arrow directed in such a way that the larger of the two heights at the ends of the @xmath177 bond crossed by this arrow is always to the right of the arrow .",
    "then on each site of @xmath149 one will have three incoming and three outcoming arrows ( the ice rule ) which precisely corresponds to the selection of the allowed vertices in the 20-vertex model .",
    "the exact solution of the 20-vertex model on the triangular lattice found by baxter @xcite demonstrates that when all vertices have the same weight ( as in our case ) the dimensionless free energy per vertex is equal to @xmath178 . in terms of the current discussion",
    "this means that the residual entropy of the reduced problem ( per site of the original triangular lattice @xmath96 ) is equal to @xmath179 .",
    "the residual entropy of the full loop problem should be larger than this value but lower than that of the four - state af potts model ( approximately equal to @xmath180 @xcite ) .",
    "let us now compare the contributions to the partition function of the reduced problem which can be associated with different configurations of the @xmath170 loops ( in other terms , with different allowed configurations of variables @xmath181 ) .",
    "the contribution from the configuration in which the @xmath170 steps are completely absent ( that is , all variables @xmath181 are equal to each other , @xmath182 ) can be found very easily .",
    "in such a situation , all variables @xmath183 can acquire two values @xmath184 independently of each other .",
    "therefore , the corresponding contribution is equal to @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the number of sites on each of the three sublattices .    if there is a closed @xmath170 loop of length @xmath71 separating the regions in which the values of the variables @xmath181 differ by 2 , then on all @xmath187 sites from @xmath151 passed by this loop the variables @xmath183 can not fluctuate and have to be equal to the average between the values of @xmath188 on both sides of the loop .",
    "this means that the presence of a loop of length @xmath71 decreases the number of allowed configurations on sublattice @xmath151 from @xmath185 to @xmath189 .",
    "the additional factor of 2 appears because for each loop configuration this loop can represent two types of steps ( positive and negative ) .    after noting that an analogous reduction is induced by every loop on @xmath154",
    ", one can conclude that after summation over all allowed configurations of variables @xmath183 one obtains an sos model defined on the triangular lattice @xmath150 . in this model",
    "the values of height variables on neighboring sites of @xmath150 can either be equal or differ by @xmath168 , whereas each step is ascribed a weightfactor exponentially decaying with its length .",
    "this model can also be interpreted @xcite as the ashkin - teller model on the triangular lattice @xcite with one of the weights equal to zero .",
    "thus we have reduced a model in which the loops of two different types are living on different interpenetrating honeycomb lattices to a model in which all loops are living on the same honeycomb lattice .",
    "however the weight factor corresponding to each loop @xmath190 contains a factor @xmath191 related to the existence of two types of loops .",
    "the loop model defined by the weight factor ( [ w(2l ) ] ) is just a particular case of the more general model @xcite with @xmath192 given by eq .",
    "( [ w(l ) ] ) . for @xmath193",
    "this model is known @xcite to have a phase transition at .",
    "this suggests that for @xmath87 and the sos model on @xmath150 defined two paragraphs above is located exactly at the point of the roughening transition , where large - scale fluctuations of @xmath172 diverge logarithmically and can be described by a ( dimensionless ) free - field effective hamiltonian , @xmath194 with dimensionless rigidity modulus @xmath195 .",
    "this value of @xmath116 ensures the marginality of the operator @xmath196 favoring even values of @xmath188 .",
    "it follows then from eq .",
    "( [ sigmaa ] ) that the correlation function decays algebraically , with @xmath197 , @xmath91 being the distance between @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it is clear already from symmetry that the analogous correlation function on @xmath151 has to decay in exactly the same way as on @xmath150 .",
    "the law of this decay can also be derived with the help of another approach .",
    "it can be rigorously shown that the correlation function of the two pseudospins on sublattice @xmath151 is equal to the probability that they belong to the same @xmath170 loop . in terms of sos representation",
    "such a loop corresponds to a closed step at which variables @xmath198 jumps by @xmath168 .    in the framework of the sos model defined on sublattice @xmath150",
    ", the total statistical weight of configurations in which the two given sites on @xmath151 belong to the same @xmath170 loop can be found by reversing the sign of the step on one of the two segments into which these two sites split the loop .",
    "@xcite this transforms the full set of such configurations into the set of configurations allowed in a system with a neutral pair of screw dislocations on going around each of which @xmath198 changes by @xmath199 .",
    "when the large - scale fluctuations of @xmath188 can be described by the hamiltonian ( [ heff - b ] ) , the dimensionless free energy associated with such a dislocation pair will be given by @xmath200 , which shows that .",
    "the same value of the exponent follows also from the possibility to unambiguously interpret the steps in the considered model as the contours of equal height .",
    "@xcite the consistency of the results produced by different approaches supplies an additional confirmation that the value of the rigidity modulus @xmath116 in eq .",
    "( [ heff - b ] ) has been correctly chosen .    in the framework of the reduced problem",
    ", the expression for the chirality of a plaquette is reduced to the product of two pseudospins on neighboring sites , @xmath201 . in order to find how chirality correlations decay with distance",
    ", it is convenient to express this product in terms of locally coarse - grained height @xmath202 $ ] as @xmath203 the variables @xmath204 are defined on @xmath177 bonds and acquire values which are shifted from integers by @xmath205 .",
    "it follows from the definition of @xmath204 that the values of these variables on adjacent bonds can be either equal to each other or differ by @xmath166 .",
    "in particular , in any regular state the values of @xmath204 are the same on all @xmath177 bonds .",
    "since the large - scale fluctuations of @xmath206 have to be described by the same hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ heff - b ] ) , as those of @xmath188 , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) that chirality correlations have to decay with exponent @xmath207 ( as in the four - state antiferomagnetic potts model , see sec .",
    "[ potts ] ) .",
    "this means that @xmath208 is a marginal operator .",
    "note that the decay of @xmath209 is much faster than that of the product of @xmath210 and @xmath211 . in terms of the loop representation",
    "the origin of this property is quite clear .",
    "the presence of an @xmath169 loop passing through the sites @xmath66 and @xmath212 strongly decreases the number of configurations with a @xmath170 loop passing through the sites @xmath67 and @xmath213 . from the analogy with the case of a single loop ( discussed two paragraphs above ) , the fraction of configurations in which two such loops are present simultaneously can be estimated by considering a system with a neutral pair of screw dislocations with @xmath214 , which again gives @xmath207 .",
