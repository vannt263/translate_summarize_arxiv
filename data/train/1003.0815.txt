    "the above picture explains the initial increase of thermopower as @xmath122 decreases .",
    "however , when the carrier density is very close to zero , the chemical potential also lies close to zero energy .",

    "the critical @xmath122 below which the magnitude of thermopower starts to decrease is thus expected to increase with temperature .",
    "this explains the shift of peak position as observed in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "4 . in ref . 7 on thermopower of monolayer graphene , the deviation at low carrier density from the higher density mott s behavior @xcite is ascribed to impurity scattering mediated coherence between the conduction and valence bands . according to this mechanism , as impurity concentration @xmath129 increases",

    "is needed to know whether or not the peak position for 300 k would shift for much larger @xmath129 .",
    "it is also interesting to ask why introducing a gap significantly enhances the thermopower of bilayer graphene .",
    "formerly , a ` pudding mold ' mechanism@xcite is introduced to account for the large thermopower observed in cobaltates . in that model , a band with a somewhat flat portion connected to a highly dispersive portion",

    "the interlayer hopping is estimated to be in the range of @xmath17@xmath120@xmath149 ev @xcite .",
    "our test calculation in clean system with @xmath17=0.4 ev for @xmath18=1 ev ( with other parameters unchanged ) gives a peak thermopower value of approximately 544 @xmath44v / k at 300 k , which is 132 @xmath44v / k larger than the result for @xmath17=0.3 ev .",
    "so , the thermopower of gapped bilayer graphene is large regardless of the choice of model parameters .    applying an electric field to trilayer or other multilayer graphene system , a gap could also be induced@xcite . for certain parameters ,",
    "the band structure is also of ` pudding mold ' like@xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting to ask how the peak value of thermopower evolves as a function of the layer number . in this work , we have only considered the effect of charged impurity scatterings .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that scattering by short - range disorder may also play an important role in the transport of gapless bilayer graphene because the screening of charged impurities in zero gap bilayer graphene is much stronger than that in monolayer graphene@xcite . though we believe that the degree of screening in gapped bilayer graphene should be much smaller than that in the gapless system",
    ", it is an interesting question whether the inclusion of short - range scatterers would change our present results much . on the other hand",
    ", the regime of large impurity concentration or strong impurity strength deserves an explicit study in terms of a less severe approximation as compared with scba used above .",
    "we defer the above questions to later studies .",
    "we have theoretically studied the thermopower of bilayer graphene .",
    "if a band gap of approximately 288 mev is induced in the system by an external bias , the room temperature thermopower is greatly enhanced by a factor of larger than 4 as compared with that of the monolayer graphene and the gapless bilayer graphene . in the presence of dilute charged impurities ,",
    "peak value of the room temperature thermopower is shown to increase slightly .",
    "this behavior is analyzed in terms of the different dependence of @xmath91 and @xmath96 on the modification of density of states by impurity .",
    "as temperature decreases , peak position of thermopower shifts slightly towards zero carrier density in the presence of dilute charged impurities .",
