    "one of the most striking aspects of quantum mechanics is certainly the superposition principle which has no counterpart in classical physics .",
    "a direct consequence of this principle is the entanglement of physical states whose characterization has been a subject of intense research in the recent years .",
    "however , the interest for the entropy in quantum systems has first emerged in black holes physics @xcite pre - empting the recent favour in condensed matter physics .",
    "the relationship between entanglement and quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) has especially drawn much attention since the original works on one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin systems @xcite . in these studies",
    ", it has been shown that entanglement measures are very sensitive to the presence of a critical point in the phase diagram .",
    "for example , in the 1d quantum ising model in a transverse field , the entanglement entropy of the ground state has been shown to be finite everywhere except at the critical field where it diverges .",
    "this entropy , which is the central topic of this paper is defined as follows .",
    "suppose that we split the degrees of freedom of the system under consideration into two subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath2 of any pure quantum state @xmath3 with respect to this bipartition is defined as the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "several fundamental questions arise concerning this entropy . in particular",
    "when , why and how does it diverge ?",
    "in @xmath6-dimensional non - critical ( gapped ) systems , the entanglement entropy is generically proportional to the surface area @xmath7 of the considered subsystem with linear size @xmath8 ( _ area law _ ) . in critical systems ,",
    "logarithmic corrections to this scaling may occur .",
    "in particular , a logarithmic scaling @xmath9 is found in critical one - dimensional boson and fermion ( and thus also spin ) systems @xcite .",
    "note that in conformal field theory , the prefactor is determined by the central charges @xcite . in higher - dimensional critical systems ,",
    "the scaling behavior is different for bosons and fermions . for bosons , field theoretical and numerical results",
    "show that the area law prevails also in the critical case @xcite . for fermions ,",
    "the area law is in this case corrected by a logarithmic factor @xcite .",
    "note also that recently , noncritical fermionic systems with rapidly decaying interactions have been shown to violate this area law @xcite .",
    "all the above cited studies focus on low - dimensional systems .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate collective systems which , in a sense , can be seen as infinite - dimensional . the physics of these models can be easily analyzed by a classical approach but the entanglement entropy comes from the quantum fluctuations around the classical ground state . here ,",
    "we map those collective systems onto models with two interacting bosonic modes , each of them corresponding to one part of a bipartite splitting of the original system .",
    "we show that the scaling of the entanglement entropy depends mainly on two factors : the number of goldstone modes ( 0 , 1 or 2 ) or , when approaching a critical point , the number of vanishing excitation gaps ( 1 or 2 ) . after giving the general results for quadratic two - mode boson hamiltonians , we discuss in detail several collective models covering different behavior of entropy scaling .",

    "[ sec : general ] , we derive the expression of the ground state entanglement entropy for general quadratic two - mode boson hamiltonians and extract its explicit dependence on the excitation energies . section [ sec : dicke ] is devoted to the study of the dicke model for which the entropy is shown to diverge as @xmath10 at the critical point where @xmath11 is the number of two - level systems . in sec .",

    "[ sec : lieb ] , we exactly compute the ground state entanglement entropy which behaves as @xmath14 .",
    "section [ sec : lmg ] focuses on the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model for which we analyze the dependence of the entropy on several parameters ( anisotropy , system and subsystem sizes ) . in each case",
    ", we compare our analytical predictions based on the scaling hypothesis ( see appendix [ app : scaling ] ) with numerics .",

    "we restrict here to the case where the coupling matrices @xmath17 and @xmath18 are real so that there are six free parameters .",
    "the aim is to find a simple expression for the entanglement entropy between both modes . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing over one of the two modes can be expressed in terms of the green function matrices defined as @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is therefore convenient to reparametrize the hamiltonian as    [ eq : twobosongen - hamvwparam ] @xmath21    where @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 . the matrices @xmath25 need to be positive definite , because the single - particle energies are necessarily positive",

    ", we thus need to rotate the spin operators according to @xmath186 note that this choice corresponds to study quantum fluctuations around one of the two classical minima ( see @xcite for discussion ) .",

    "such a point is often present in anisotropic systems @xcite .",
    "+      for @xmath137 , the above expression of the gaps are still valid in the thermodynamical limit and one recovers the goldstone mode predicted by the classical approach .",
    "this gapless excitation prevents from using the scaling hypothesis to determine the behavior of the entropy .",
    "fortunately , the isotropic case is trivial since the eigenstates of the lmg hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham_lmg ] ) are then the eigenstates @xmath193 of @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "the ground state is obtained for @xmath138 and @xmath196 for @xmath115 , whereas for @xmath92 one has @xmath197 .",
    "thus , in the symmetric phase , the entropy vanishes since the state @xmath198 is separable , but in the broken phase , the entropy of the dicke state @xmath199 is known to diverge as @xmath12 @xcite .",

    "the classical ground state has a finite degeneracy , i.e.  no goldstone mode : this situation is met in the broken phases of the dicke and anisotropic lmg model , as well as in the symmetric phases of the models studied here . in this case , and away from critical points , both excitations around any classical states are gapful and the entropy is finite ( possibly vanishing ) .",
    "the classical ground state has one goldstone mode : this situation is met in the broken phases of the two - level bcs model and the isotropic lmg model . in this case , one excitation energy is finite and the other vanishes and the entropy diverges as @xmath12 .",

    "the general analysis of the order @xmath99 ( at which the effective bosonic models are quadratic ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] shows how the entanglement entropy diverges when excitation gaps vanish .",
    "its scaling can thus be classified according to the number vanishing of gaps , when a critical point is approached . in the anisotropic lmg model as in the dicke model , there is only one vanishing gap and the entropy diverges as @xmath10 in both models .    in the two - level bcs model ,",
    "there are two vanishing gaps and we obtained an entropy that diverges as @xmath13 .",
    "however , these behaviors are found using the scaling hypothesis which relies on the scaling variable @xmath202 ( see appendix [ app : scaling ] ) . in models studied in this paper ,",
    "one always has @xmath203 due to their relationship with a quartic oscillator @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this value depends on the hamiltonian and would be different if , for instance , at the critical point , the terms of order @xmath99 and @xmath69 vanish simultaneously . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian would be sextic instead of quartic in the creation and annihilation operators and the scaling of the entropy would be different @xcite .",
    "note also that in the isotropic lmg model , the entropy vanishes at the critical point even though there are two vanishing gaps at the critical point .",
    "the analysis performed here for simple models corroborates the results obtained in many 1d systems where it has been also found that diverging entropies are always associated to gapless excitations @xcite .",

    "if @xmath215 near the critical point , the scaling hypothesis predicts that it diverges as @xmath216 .",
