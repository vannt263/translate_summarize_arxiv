    "growing surfaces are commonly divided into two classes , vicinal or singular @xcite .",
    "on vicinal surfaces the density of atomic steps , originating from the miscut of the sample , is high , so that most of the atoms arriving on the surface attach to these steps and the nucleation of adatom islands on the terraces may be neglected .",
    "the crystal then grows in the step - flow mode , simply by propagation of the steps .",
    "as no new steps appear , all the steps have the same sign , and the surface profile remains monotonic in the direction of vicinality . even if the step morphology is unstable against step meandering , the growth may be considered as a two - dimensional problem .",
    "it has been observed however in experiments @xcite as well as in computer simulations @xcite that the step - flow mode is only metastable .",
    "eventually steps having a sign opposite to the original vicinality appear on the surface .",
    "this destroys the two dimensional character of the growth and leads to the formation of genuinely three - dimensional structures .",
    "steps of opposite sign may originate from two different mechanisms : either from the nucleation of adatom islands on the terraces , or through the formation of vacancy islands .",
    "island nucleation on the terraces is severely suppressed by the steps as they collect the deposited adatoms , keeping the adatom concentration low . due to fluctuations ,",
    "however , some nucleation events do occur .",
    "nucleation of islands on the terraces alone is not enough to destabilize the step - flow growth , as the islands collide with the propagating steps and merge with them .",
    "the step - flow growth is destabilized only if new islands are nucleated , on the average , on top of the terrace islands before the latter are incorporated into the steps .",
    "vacancy islands can be formed on the terraces due to the meandering of the steps . during growth the atomic steps",
    "often do not remain straight , but form a meander pattern @xcite either due to the bales - zangwill ( bz ) instability @xcite , or due to a kink - ehrlich - schwoebel effect ( kese ) @xcite . as the meander amplitude becomes large in the course of time , it is plausible that a step might cross itself forming thus a closed loop , _ i.e. _ a vacancy island . before turning to the detailed analysis of this effect , which forms the main subject of this letter",
    ", we briefly discuss destabilization due to the nucleation of islands .",
    "a common criterion for step - flow growth is that the step distance @xmath0 should be smaller than the nucleation length @xmath1 , the distance between the nucleation centers on a singular surface ; for irreversible aggregation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the adatom diffusion coefficient and @xmath4 is the deposition flux @xcite . when @xmath5 essentially all atoms go to the existing steps and nucleation events are very rare . due to fluctuations in the deposition beam , however , nucleation of adatom islands occurs also during step - flow growth .",
    "when @xmath0 is not too much smaller than @xmath1 , islands are continuously nucleated on the terraces and incorporated into the steps .",
    "the nucleation length is altered by the presence of the steps and becomes @xmath6 parallel to the steps @xcite .",
    "coalescence of the terrace islands with the steps also affects the step morphology @xcite .",
    "nucleation of islands on the terraces is not enough to launch mound formation .",
    "it is also required that , _ on average _ , a new island will be nucleated on top of the terrace island before it is incorporated into the step , because this process must be repeated several times when a mound starts to form .",
    "nucleation on top of islands is enhanced by an ehrlich - schwoebel ( es ) barrier , which prevents the descent of adatoms across steps @xcite .",
    "the strength of this effect depends on the ratio of the es - length @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the interlayer hopping rate , to the island radius @xmath9 @xcite . when @xmath10 second layer nucleation on a singular surface does not occur until the first layer islands have started to coalesce , at @xmath11 , and the initial growth proceeds layer by layer",
    "; on a vicinal surface this implies that second layer nucleation is preempted by incorporation of the first layer islands .",
    "destabilization of step flow growth by mound formation thus requires a strong es effect , in the sense that @xmath12 at the time of incorporation . to obtain a quantitative criterion",
    ", we start from the expression @xmath13 for the nucleation rate on top of an island of radius @xmath9 , which holds for strong es barriers and irreversible nucleation @xcite . the probability that nucleation has occurred on the island within a time @xmath14 after its creation is then @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the island radius at time @xmath14 .",
    "mound formation requires that @xmath17 grows to order unity , say @xmath18 , during the time @xmath19 that the step needs to travel a distance @xmath20 , and hence to engulf the island . as the step velocity is @xmath21 , we have @xmath22 .",
    "we further assume that half of the material landing on a terrace segment of length @xmath9 contributes to the growth of the island , so that @xmath23 . evaluating ( [ nuc_number ] ) and setting @xmath24 , we find that mound formation occurs when @xmath25 the length scale @xmath26 has the same dependence on the growth parameters as the radius of the top terrace of a mound growing on a singular surface @xcite , though the dimensionless prefactor is somewhat larger .",
    "note that since for strong es barriers @xmath27 , the condition ( [ lc ] ) does not contradict the conventional step flow criterion @xmath28 .",
    "this analysis assumes that steps are straight and equidistant , and that the nucleation events on the terraces are uncorrelated . in reality",
    "the step train may suffer from growth instabilities either in the step direction ( _ step meandering _ ) @xcite or in the direction of the vicinality ( _ step bunching _ ) @xcite ; sometimes the two instabilities even coexist @xcite . in the case of step",
    "bunching the large terraces forming between the bunches are prominent sites for island nucleation and consequently for the formation of mounds .",
    "also step meandering leads to a non - uniform terrace width . in an in - phase meander",
    "the terrace width becomes locally smaller than the initial terrace width @xmath0 @xcite , but at sites where the phase - shift between consecutive steps is large , large terraces are formed .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in the following section . in growth experiments on cu(1 1 12 ) a fairly regular array of mounds was observed @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the mounds do not form independently of each other .",
    "the formation of vacancy islands was studied using kinetic monte - carlo simulations of a standard sos model on a square lattice .",
    "the elementary processes are the deposition of atoms at rate @xmath4 and the hopping of adatoms to nearest neighbor sites with a rate @xmath29 .",
    "the activation energy @xmath30 includes an energy barrier @xmath31 for diffusion on a flat terrace , a contribution @xmath32 for each lateral in - plane bond , an additional energy barrier @xmath33 for breaking a bond , and an es - barrier @xmath34 , which is implemented through the change in the number of next - nearest neighbors in the planes above and below the hopping atom . the bond breaking",
    "barrier @xmath33 serves to enhance step edge diffusion compared to detachment from the step .",
    "we used rectangular lattices with @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) sites along ( perpendicular to ) the steps and periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath37-direction .",
    "the nominal step spacing was @xmath38 . for a detailed description of the model",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the activation barriers were set to the values @xmath39  ev , @xmath40  ev , @xmath41  ev and @xmath42  ev .",
    "the temperature was @xmath43 k and the diffusion pre - factor for this choice of parameters the steps undergo a meandering instability due to the kink - ehrlich - schwoebel effect ( kese ) @xcite , leading to wavy steps with a wavelength @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the diffusion rate along a straight step ; within our model , the activation energy for edge diffusion is @xmath46",
    ". in the kese instability the steps start to meander with random phase shifts , in contrast to the bales - zangwill instability , where the steps meander collectively and the step modulations are in - phase from the outset @xcite . due to the es barrier the phase correlation increases during time , as the steps have a tendency to follow the leading step @xcite .",
    "even if the phase correlation increases locally , however , globally the steps remain incoherent , leading to occasional large phase shifts between subsequent steps where two domains of ( relatively ) coherent meander are joined , see fig [ vac_form ] . at these sites",
    "the strong meander easily leads to formation of a closed step loop , as a step crosses itself .",
    "this process is shown in fig .",
    "[ vac_form ] . for the parameters used in the simulations the critical length ( [ lc ] ) @xmath47 ,",
    "so the formation of mounds due to island nucleation can safely be disregarded .",
    "the average distance of islands in the step direction is @xmath48 even for the largest value used for the flux @xmath4 . in the simulations adatom islands",
    "were never observed .    unless the vacancy island created through the self - crossing of a step is rapidly filled , it acts as a pinning center for the following steps .",
    "consequently the pinned steps then also form closed loops around the pinning center , and a deepening crater appears .",
    "the development is seen in the snap shots in fig .",
    "[ crater_grow ] .",
    "it should be noted that the filling of vacancies is severely hampered by the es - barrier . during further growth ,",
    "the uphill surface current induced by the es - barrier @xcite leads to the deepening , lateral growth and coalescence of craters . as seen in fig .",
    "[ crater_grow ] , the ripple pattern is now severely distorted and large terraces between neighboring carters appear .",
    "eventually islands are nucleated on these large terraces , launching the formation of a mound .",
    "creation of mounds has been observed also earlier in simulations of a similar sos model @xcite . in",
    "the previous works the meandering of the steps was due to the bz - instability , rather than the kese mechanism which is relevant for this work .",
    "also in the earlier works the mounds were seen form preferentially at the sites where the phase coherence between the steps is poor @xcite .",
    "we have seen above that the formation of a vacancy island requires a large amplitude meander and a large phase shift between consecutive steps . however , as the meander amplitude grows in time , the phase correlation also improves .",
    "the spatial distribution of the vacancies results from the competition between these two effects . to acquire good statistics for the vacancy separation , simulations of extremely large system sizes would be necessary . here",
    "we focus instead on the statistics of the appearance of the _ first _ vacancy island in the system .",
    "vacancy islands were identified as closed step loops in the sos configuration .",
    "this method does not differentiate between vacancy and adatom islands , but in the parameter regime of our simulations no island nucleation takes place on the terraces .",
    "the loops were searched by first finding the contour lines separating the lattice in parts where the surface height @xmath49 is higher or lower than some reference height @xmath50 . by varying the reference height @xmath50 between the highest and the lowest value of the height in the configuration , all steps are found . after finding a step",
    "it was checked whether the same point appears in the contour twice , indicating a closed loop .",
    "steps having length 4 were neglected as they mark adatoms .",
    "to study the vacancy separation in the direction of the vicinality it was investigated whether vacancies form at all in systems containing a relatively small number of steps , @xmath51 . for small @xmath36 the phase coherence propagates through the whole system before the meander amplitude becomes large enough for loop formation and the final configuration is a perfect in - phase step train . for larger @xmath52 vacancies may form before the meander phases have synchronized . thus varying the system size @xmath52 , keeping the step distance fixed , an estimate for the distance between the vacancies in the vicinal direction",
    "is obtained .",
    "results from such simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ pnuc - ly ] .",
    "the probability for the creation of a vacancy changes quite rapidly from zero to one as the number of steps in the system increases .",
    "the data also show a weak dependence on the step length @xmath53 , which we however expect to saturate at large @xmath35 . based on fig .",
    "[ pnuc - ly ] , we estimate that the distance between vacancies in the @xmath54-direction is of the order of 50 under the conditions of the simulations .",
    "the most natural candidate for the vacancy distance in the step direction is the meander wavelength @xmath55 . to study this length scale , the average waiting time @xmath56 before the appearence of the first vacany , starting with a train of perfectly straight steps , was measured .",
    "the waiting time is inversely proportional to the number @xmath57 of potential vacancy formation sites . for fixed @xmath36",
    "we expect that @xmath58 , and hence @xmath59 .",
    "figure [ tx - lx ] confirms that @xmath60 , showing that there is a constant vacancy formation probability per unit step length .",
    "to test the relation @xmath61 , we have conducted simulations with various values of the growth flux @xmath4 and the bond energy @xmath32 , which control the meander wavelength ( [ lambda_m ] ) @xcite .",
    "results for @xmath62 , @xmath63 are plotted in fig .",
    "surprisingly , the data are consistent with the relationship @xmath64 , which indicates that the number of potential vacancy sites scales as @xmath65 rather than as @xmath66 we have no explanation to offer at present .",
    "qualitatively , we note that the deposition flux and the bond energy also affect the growth rate of the meander amplitude and the ordering time scale into the in - phase mode , and hence changing these parameters alters also the vacancy separation in the vicinal direction in addition to the meander wavelength .",
    "in this paper we have studied two mechanisms for the destabilization of step flow growth in the presence of an ehrlich - schwoebel effect .",
    "we have derived a quantitative criterion for destabilization due to mound formation , and presented extensive simulation results for destabilization due to vacancy island formation mediated by strong step meandering . in the latter case",
    "we have found evidence for the appearance of a new length scale , proportional to the square of the meander wavelength , which determines the distance between vacancy islands along the step direction .",
    "an important insight is that the vacancy formation process is controlled by the competition between the growth of the meander amplitude and the increase of phase correlations between consecutive steps .",
    "this suggests that the behavior may be rather different when step meandering is driven by the bales - zangwill - instability , rather than by the kese mechanism considered here , because in the former case phase correlations are present from the very outset .",
    "it may also be of interest to extend the present study to systems without an explicit es - barrier .",
    "on the one hand , in such a system the phase correlations develop much more slowly @xcite , favoring the formation of vacancy islands ; on the other hand , in the absence of the es - barrier the deepening and coarsening of craters would also be slowed down .",
