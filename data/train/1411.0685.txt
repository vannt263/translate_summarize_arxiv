    "the heterogeneous techniques that have been used to detect binary agn , coupled with the alternate phenomena that can describe double - peaked spectral emission lines , implies that significant progress in this field will require a statistical sample of binary agns with well - understood selection biases .",
    "the most direct way to search for binary agns is to use galaxy mergers identified with optical or near - infrared ( ir ) images .",
    "but , the vast majority of such mergers are expected to contain either inactive or single agns .",
    "so , the addition of high - resolution radio or x - ray imaging , or spatially resolved spectroscopy , is necessary to truly identify and characterize two active components in such mergers .",
    "this work is motived by the discovery of sdss j150243.1@xmath5111557 , a double - peaked [ oiii ] agn at @xmath6 that we confirmed as a binary agn with high - resolution multi - frequency radio images from the very large array ( vla ; * ? ? ?",

    "the catalogs of the co - added sdss images are not band - matched , so each band has different source lists . to include cases where the optical counterparts in a pair have very different colors",
    ", we consider a radio source to have an optical i d if an optical source is found within the matching radius in _ any _ of the five sdss bands .",
    "we avoid cases where multiple radio sources share the same optical counterpart by associating the optical source with the closest radio source only .",
    "we identified optical counterparts for 11,203 ( 62% ) radio sources .",
    "we then search for radio pairs with angular separations less than 5 .",
    "we choose such a small separation because ( 1 ) we are mainly interested in kpc - scale binaries ( 5  = 10 kpc at @xmath22 ) and ( 2 ) to reduce contamination from projected pairs ( since we only have limited spectroscopic redshifts for the radio sources , see   [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "we also require both radio sources in a pair to have optical ids to reduce contamination by extended radio sources such as multiple hotspots / jets emergent from the same radio galaxy . considering",
    "the surface density of radio sources with optical counterparts is @xmath3122 deg@xmath23 in the vla - stripe82 survey , the probability that two random radio sources are within 5  is only 0.074% . over the entire area of the survey , we would therefore expect to find only @xmath38 pairs by chance .",
    "in contrast , we find 134 such pairs . because some sources belong to multiple pairs , these pairs contain 261 radio sources .",
    "note that the separations between the optical ids may be greater than 5  because of the adopted 1.8  matching radius .",
    "next , we examine the optical and radio images of these pairs to remove the following clear contaminants ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : single ] for examples ) :    * singles * : :    a single optical source is assigned to two separate radio sources due    to cross - band astrometry errors ; this problem is particularly    significant for faint sources . or , one of the optical ids is a    spurious source , e.g. , because of nearby bright stars ,    over - deblending , or edge effects ( 35 cases ) . * lobes",

    "based on the mean source density in the sdss co - adds    ( @xmath316 arcmin@xmath23 at    @xmath24 ) , we expect a background density of    @xmath36 arcmin@xmath23 for random optical pairs    with separations less than 5  ( 16 cases ) .",
    "finally , the remaining 83 pairs are divided into the following four grades .",
    "this step is necessary because we have adopted a relatively large matching radius between radio and optical sources ( 1.8 ) when compared with the pair separation ( @xmath255 ) .",
    "* grade a * : :    both optical sources are well enclosed by the radio structure and are    clearly associated with a discrete radio source ( i.e. , `` secure    optical ids '' ) . in such cases ,",
    "the pa between the optical ids is well    aligned with that of the radio structure ( i.e. , `` aligned pas '' ) ( 22    cases ) . * grade b * : :    secure optical i d and aligned pas , but the radio morphologies suggest    that one of the optical components could be either a projected source    within the radio lobe generated by the primary component or    emission - line gas ejected by the radio outflow .",
    "projected pairs are a    significant concern because of the high source density of the deep    co - added sdss images . on average ,",
    "@xmath336% of optical    sources in the sdss co - adds would have a nearby optical source within    5 .",
    "however , we note that there is no clear boundary between grade a    and b and the separation is quite subjective ( 30 cases ) . * grade c * : :    one of the optical ids shows significant offset from the corresponding    radio sources .",
    "but the optical and radio pas are aligned ( 13 cases ) .",
    "* grade d * : :    offset optical ids as in grade c , but the pas are misaligned ( 18    cases ) .",
    "we consider grade c and d sources as misidentified optical ids ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gradecd ] for examples ) , and grade a and b sources as candidate binary radio agns ( see figs .  [ fig : gradea ] and [ fig : gradeb ] ) . the properties of these candidates",
    "are tabulated in tables  [ tab : gradea ] and [ tab : gradeb ] .    in summary ,",
    "using the vla - stripe82 survey and the depth - optimized sdss co - adds , we could place a strict upper limit on the surface density of binary radio agns with 1.8  @xmath13 sep @xmath13 5.0  of @xmath130.6  deg@xmath23 .",
    "although excluded from this study , grade c and d pairs are also interesting because one of the galaxies could be experiencing harassment from the radio outflow of the neighboring galaxy , if they are at the same redshift .",
    "spectroscopy is useful to measure the redshifts and to determine the nature of the radio sources .",
    "here we have obtained optical spectra for the radio sources from the sdss and our own keck program .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts of the candidate binaries are included in tables  [ tab : gradea ] and [ tab : gradeb ] .",
    "we obtained spectroscopy for both components for eight candidate binaries ( 5 grade a s and 3 grade b s ) .",
    "two out of the eight candidates turned out to be projected pairs ( i.e. , the optical ids are at widely different redshifts ; 2302@xmath160003 and 2318@xmath50045 ) , and the other six are all confirmed mergers with radial velocity separations less than 140  km s@xmath12  and projected physical separation between 4  kpc @xmath13 sep @xmath13 12  kpc .",
    "properties of these confirmed pairs are listed in table  [ tab : pairs ] , and their spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : specs ] .",
    "we cross - matched the radio sources optical ids with the sdss dr10 spectroscopic catalog ( specobj-dr10.fits ) .",
    "the dr10 catalog includes spectra from sdss i , ii and iii , including the sdss - i and ii legacy surveys , segue1 , segue2 and boss .",
    "we use a matching radius of 1.0 , @xmath26 smaller than that used in matching the radio catalog with the photometric catalogs .",
    "2,622 radio sources have sdss spectra .",
    "although the spectroscopic redshifts range from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , 75% of the sources are at @xmath29 and the median redshift is @xmath30 .    because two fibers on the same plate can not be placed closer than 55  and 65  for sdss and boss , respectively , pairs of galaxies with small angular separations would suffer from incompleteness due to fiber collisions @xcite , unless they are in overlapping regions of different plates .",
    "so we expect only a small fraction of the pairs in our sample have sdss spectroscopy for both components .",
    "indeed , only 4 out of the 44 candidate binaries have sdss spectra for both components ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specs ] ) . among those ,",
    "two binaries overlap with the binary agn sample selected from spectroscopically identified agns within sdss dr7 ( 0051@xmath50020 and 2206@xmath50003 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other two , 0134@xmath160107 and 2300@xmath160005 , are not in their sample because their optical emission comes almost entirely from old stellar populations without detectable emission lines .",
    "as we will show , galaxies in the latter pairs are _ bona fide _ radio agns .",
    "we obtained longslit spectroscopy during part of 2011 oct 23 ( ut ) with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the keck i telescope .",
    "we used the 600/4000 grism in the blue , the 400/8500 grating in the red , and the 560 dichroic .",
    "the central wavelength of the grating was 8000   , so that the blue and red spectra overlap between 5595 and 5810   , and the full wavelength range is from 3100    to 1  @xmath21 m .",
    "the 1.5-wide longslit was used throughout the night . with the chosen dispersive elements , the spectral resolutions in fwhm are @xmath36    and @xmath310    for the blue and red spectra , respectively .",
    "the integration times ranged from 10 min to 30 min .",
    "the seeing was highly variable : the cfht / dimm s measurements ranged from 0.3  to @xmath312  with a mean around 1.5 .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard star bd@xmath528  4211 was observed at the beginning of the night for flux calibration .",
    "we reduced the raw data with the xidl codexavier / idl/ ] written and maintained by j.  x.  prochaska , j.  hennawi , and others .",
    "the xidl / low - redux pipeline follows the standard data reduction steps and reduces the blue and red channels separately .",
    "it begins by subtracting a super bias from the raw ccd frames , tracing the slit profiles using flat fields , and deriving the 2d wavelength solution for each slit using the arcs .",
    "then it flat - fields each slit and rejects cosmic - rays , identifies objects automatically in the slit , and builds the 2d bspline super sky model .",
    "no rectification is performed to avoid interpolations . before and after subtracting the super sky model ,",
    "we extract 1d spectra from each object using a top hat profile that follows the continuum trace of the object itself or that of the brightest source on the slit if the object is too faint .",
    "finally , instrument flexure is removed by tweaking the wavelength array of the extracted 1d spectra using isolated sky lines , and a sensitivity function is derived from the extracted standard star spectra and is applied to the science spectra .",
    "seven candidate binaries were selected for keck spectroscopy .",
    "the lris sample included 2 grade a candidates ( 2232@xmath50012 and 2300@xmath160005 ) , 4 grade b candidates ( 0152@xmath160010 , 2220@xmath50058 , 2302@xmath160003 , and 2318@xmath50045 ) , and 1 grade d pair ( 2252@xmath50106 , which is shown in the lower left panel in the grade d examples in fig .",

    "all pairs are spatially resolved except 0152@xmath160010 , for which we were only able to measure the spectroscopic redshift for the brighter component , 015253.79@xmath16001005.6 .",
    "six of 13 resolved sources covered by lris already have sdss spectra , and they are consistent with the lris spectra with similar s / n ; so we have obtained new optical spectra for 7 radio sources .",
    "the lris spectra of the grade d pair , 2252@xmath50106 , shows that it is a merging pair of a red elliptical and a tidally distorted star - forming galaxy at @xmath32 .",
    "we do not discuss it further because of its lowered grade .",
    "for the sdss spectra , we adopt the emission line measurements from the portsmouth group @xcite .",
    "the measurements are based on public codes penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and gas and absorption line fitting ( gandalf ; * ? ? ?",
    "stellar population templates and gaussian emission lines are fit simultaneously to separate stellar continuum and emission / absorption lines from ionized gas .",
    "dust - extinction correction is applied to both the stellar continuum and the emission lines .",
    "the same decomposition method is applied for the keck / lris spectra .",
    "the emission line fluxes and their upper limits are corrected for fiber / slit aperture losses using the difference between @xmath33-band spectrum - synthesized magnitude and the @xcite magnitude from the @xmath33-band image .    out of the 2,629 radio sources with optical spectra , 1,386 are between @xmath34 .",
    "we now discuss the properties of this subsample because we could measure h@xmath2 fluxes , which is critical to classify the sources based on the @xcite diagram ( `` bpt diagram '' ) involving the [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratio ( fig .

    "clearly , we need an independent determination of the merger fraction among radio - selected agns to break this degeneracy and obtain a reliable estimate of the duty cycle of radio - mode accretion in galaxy mergers .    our search of radio - selected binary agns complements binary searches in x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , optical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or ir ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because the majority of radio - selected agns show different properties from agns selected at other wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that radio - selected agns at @xmath51 primarily inhabit luminous red - sequence galaxies in massive ( @xmath52  @xmath40 ) dark matter halos .",
    "their accretion rates are lower than x - ray - selected and ir - selected agns , with eddington ratios of @xmath53 .",
    "it has been suspected that the progenitors of radio - selected agns live in the most massive halos at @xmath54 .",
    "their host galaxies have gone through intense growth phases as merger - triggered starburst galaxies and quasars at @xmath55 . at the observed epoch ( @xmath51 ) ,",
    "star formation in the host galaxies has long ceased and the central black holes are presumably accreting hot halo gas in a radiatively inefficient mode ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , our radio search is sensitive to accreting black holes at a different evolutionary stage , in a different population of host galaxies , and in different galactic environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , when compared to x - ray / optical / ir - selected binaries .",
    "the major advantages of using high - resolution radio imaging to find binary agns are : ( 1 ) radio emission is free of dust obscuration , and ( 2 ) the relatively fast survey speed ( at 1.4  ghz , each pointing of the vla covers 0.25  deg@xmath0 with an angular resolution of 1.4 ) . looking ahead , our method will be able to identify thousands of kpc - scale binary agns , as high - resolution radio surveys of even wider areas become available , e.g. , the vla 3  ghz survey of the entire 300  deg@xmath0 stripe 82 @xcite , the 10,000 deg@xmath0 vla sky survey ( vlass ) , and eventually an all sky survey with the square kilometer array ( ska ) .",
