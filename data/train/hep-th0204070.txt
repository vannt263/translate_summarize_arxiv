    "despite numerous efforts , it seems difficult to reconcile string theory with the highly successfull paradigm of inflation . in this brief note , following gibbons @xcite , we investigate whether some form of sen s tachyonic matter @xcite might provide the necessary ingredients for a phase of inflationary expansion in the early universe .    according to sen @xcite ,",
    "( see also @xcite ) , a rolling tachyon condensate in either bosonic or supersymmetric string theory can be described by a fluid which in the homogeneous limit has energy density @xmath0 and pressure [ eos ] p = - v(t ) - ( t ) ( 1 - t^2 ) with @xmath1 the tachyon field and @xmath2 the tachyon potential .",
    "these expressions are obtained from the tachyon matter effective lagrangian [ lag ] l = - v(t ) . given the generic properties of @xmath2 for @xmath3 , a most remarkable feature of sen s equation of state ( [ eos ] ) is that tachyon matter interpolates smoothly between p = - w = -1 for @xmath4 and p = 0 w = 0 as @xmath5 reaches its limiting value @xmath6 . as already emphasized by gibbons",
    "@xcite , if the tachyon condensate starts to roll down the potential with small intial @xmath5 , a universe dominated by this new form of matter will smoothly evolve from a phase of accelerated expansion to a phase dominated by a non - relativistic fluid .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the latter could contribute to some new form of dark matter .",
    "however , the topic of this paper is whether or not the tachyon condensate could be relevant for inflation .",
    "( for related speculations , see for instance @xcite@xcite . )",
    "the shape of the tachyon condensate effective potential depends on the system under consideration . in bosonic string theory for instance ,",
    "this potential has a maximum @xmath7 at @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the tension of some unstable bosonic d - brane , a local minimum with @xmath10 , generically at @xmath11 , corresponding to a metastable closed bosonic string vacuum , and a runaway behaviour for negative @xmath1 .",
    "an exact classical potential ( _ i.e. _ exact to all orders in @xmath12 , but only tree level in @xmath13 ) encompassing these properties has been computed @xcite , [ potential ] v(t ) = v_0(1 + t / t_0 ) .",
    "note that the curvature at the top of the potential ( [ potential ] ) is @xmath14 . as the tachyon field has dimension @xmath15 = e^{-1}$ ] , if @xmath16 , from eq.([lag ] ) we see that it is natural to rescale @xmath1 by @xmath17 . at @xmath7 ,",
    "the mass of the canonically normalized @xmath18 is then @xmath19 . in @xcite , @xmath20 and @xmath9",
    "is the tension of a bosonic dp - brane , @xmath21 .",
    "we shall see that these values of @xmath9 and @xmath22 seem marginally incompatible with inflation : the potential is simply too steep . however , the values for @xmath9 and @xmath22 required to obtain slow - roll inflation are within an order of magnitude of these values .",
    "as shown by gibbons , for a roberston - walker tachyon matter dominated universe , the friedman equation takes the standard form h^2 = ^2 3 = ^2 3v with @xmath23 and where we have assumed spatial flatness , a closed universe will eventually recollapse .",
    "we assume flatness for simplicity .",
    "alternatively , the recollapse can be supposed to be in the far future of our model universe . ] and have chosen to put the cosmological constant to zero .",
    "entropy conservation gives as usual = - 3 h ( + p ) the latter being equivalent to the equation of motion for the tachyon field @xmath1 , [ eom ] v t1 - t^2 + 3 h vt + v^= 0 where @xmath24 .",
    "we would like to use these equations to determine the slow - roll conditions for inflation .",
    "the first condition to be satisfied is that the expansion is accelerating ( see for instance @xcite or @xcite ) @xmath25 which requires that . ]",
    "[ inflation ] t^2 < 23 . in order to have a sufficiently long period of inflation ,",
    "the tachyon field should start rolling with small initial @xmath5 . to relate the condition ( [ inflation ] ) to the shape of the potential",
    ", we have to calculate the slow - roll conditons . following a standard procedure @xcite",
    ", we can express the evolution of the universe as a function of @xmath1 rather than time .",
    "using h = - ^2 2 v t^2 and because of the monoticity of @xmath1 with respect to time , we can rewrite this equation as h^(t ) = - ^2 2 v t where the prime denotes derivation with respect to @xmath1 . taking the square of the friedmann equation we get [ hj ] h^^2 - 94 h^4(t ) + ^4 4 v(t)^2 = 0 .",
    "this first order differential equation is the analog for tachyon matter of the hamilton - jacobi form of the friedmann equation with a single inflaton field @xcite .",
    "it expresses the fact that @xmath26 is negligible as long as h^2 v. solving ( [ hj ] ) for @xmath27 , we can then get @xmath5 as a function of @xmath1 = 1 - ( ^2 v3 h^2)^2 . using the potential ( [ potential ] ) one can solve ( [ hj ] ) numerically .",
    "we have chosen the field @xmath28 to be slightly displaced from the maximum of the potential with initial @xmath29 .",
    "we also assume @xmath30 for obvious reasons . the amount of inflation obtained depends upon the variable @xmath31 and on a dimensionless parameter @xmath32 which characterizes the flatness of the potential close to its peak x_0 ^ 2 = ^2 t_0 ^ 2 v_0 . in figure [ dott2 ] we plot @xmath33 for different values of @xmath32 .",
    "the pertinent feature of this figure is that for increasing @xmath32 , inflation ends at increasing values of @xmath1 .",
    "this is equivalent to requiring that as the rolling of the field commences , the @xmath34 term is negligible in the equation of motion for the tachyon field ( [ eom ] ) , so that 3 h v t - v^. [ slow ] another quantity of interest is the number of e - folds during the inflationary phase , n(t ) = _ t^t_end h dt = - _",
    "t^t_end h^2 vv^ dt this is shown in figure [ efolds ] .",
    "to successfully use inflation to solve the horizon problem and bring us a suitably flat spectrum of perturbations we require @xmath35 e - folds of inflation whilst the field is rolling .",
    "as always , there is some uncertainty in the number of e - folds related to the choice of initial conditions . however ,",
    "if we assume that @xmath33 is small initially and that @xmath31 starts at less than about @xmath36 then the total number of e - folds becomes insensitive to the exact initial conditions .",
    "we choose the value of @xmath32 so as to accommodate enough e - folds and the normalization to the cobe spectrum , which we shall describe in the next section . for",
    "the time being , we simply note that inflation lasts longer if @xmath32 is larger , as shown in figure [ dott2 ] .",
    "once inflation is over the expansion of the tachyon - matter dominated universe slows rapidly which precludes the possibility of the modes generated during the slow roll regime being pushed outside our present day horizon .",
    "the numerical analysis shows that inflation requires that @xmath37 .",
    "once this is satisfied the field @xmath1 evolves in a framework analogous to the slow - roll approximation for scalar fields . in order for the conditions",
    "h^2 v and h v t - v^to hold , the following inequalities must be satisfied : [ epsilon ] 1 and [ eta ] - v^2 v^2 1 .",
    "these are just the usual definitions of the slow - roll parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "their form is different from the usual expressions because we are taking derivatives with respect to @xmath1 . near @xmath9 , for small @xmath5 , one can use the canonically normalized field @xmath40 which brings ( [ epsilon ] ) and ( [ eta ] ) to their usual form @xcite . as we assume that the tachyon is rolling from the top of the potential , generically @xmath41 for small @xmath31 , so that the second condition is the most stringent one . using the potential ( [ potential ] ) to be specific , ( [ eta ] ) becomes ^2 v_0 t_0 ^ 2 x_0 ^ 2 1 [ condition1 ] a condition which is consistent with the numerical analysis of the preceding section .",
    "finally we must estimate the size of the fluctuations and compare this estimate with the magnitude of the density pertubations observed by cobe .",
    "assuming that the slow - roll approximation can be made to hold over a significant range of cosmic scales , the spectral index @xmath42 is taken to be scale independent with n 1 - 2 1 .",
    "[ spectrum ] we also follow the standard procedure to estimate the density perturbations ||t where .",
    "we then use the slow roll condition ( @xmath43 ) to eliminate @xmath44 leading to the expression || and we obtain the expression for the density perturbation during inflation when @xmath31 is of order one    @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath46 we see that ^3 v_0 t_0 610 ^ -4 .",
    "[ condition2 ] in order to calculate the magnitude of our perturbations , we assumed that @xmath47 is negligible and that we are close to the peak of the potential so that we can substitute @xmath1 for the canonical scalar field @xmath48 .",
    "however , without a full derivation of the perturbations starting with the lagrangian ( @xmath49 ) we can not say at what point our approximations break down , and what kind of behaviour replaces the normal lore at that point .",
    "we have not mentioned the precise origin of the tachyon field in question , but given the string theory origin of sen s equation of state , it is tempting to write the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath22 in terms of the string length @xmath50 and the open string coupling constant @xmath13 , v_0=,t_0=_0 l_s . where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are dimensionless parameters such that @xmath53 is the tension of a d3-brane and @xmath54 is the inverse tachyon mass@xcite .",
    "the gravitational coupling in 4 dimensions is given in terms of the stringy parameters by @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the compactification radius of the compact 6 dimensional manifold , taken here to be a 6-torus . for the @xmath57 effective theory to be applicable one usually requires that @xmath58 since @xmath59 denotes the self t - dual point where the mass spectrum of kk and winding modes become degenerate @xcite .",
    "the volume of the compact space therefore must satisfy the inequality @xmath60 .    in order for the gravitational waves at the end of inflation to be compatible with cmb observtions",
    ", there is a further condition @xmath61 @xmath62 which together with the requirement for enough e - folds ( @xmath63 ) and the magnitude of the perturbations as given by equation ( @xmath64 ) leads to three conditions which can be written as @xmath65 these conditions can not all be satisfied simultaneously with the values one would choose as a first guess , @xmath66 , for any @xmath67 . in the expression of the planck mass which led us to underestimate strong gravity effects . ]    for @xmath68 and insisting on @xmath69 , ( [ ngw ] ) gives @xmath70 while ( [ ic ] ) imposes @xmath71 , corresponding to a rather light tachyon mass @xmath72 .",
    "this is phenomenologically the simplest solution , but is at odds with expectations from string theory .",
    "( see however @xcite . )",
    "if one insists on a tachyon mass @xmath73 , the only alternative without entering the strong coupling regime is to increase the energy density , for instance by increasing the number of branes , in the spirit of @xcite where the potential arises from the combined tachyonic potential of a number of brane / anti - brane systems .",
    "the problem here is that in order for each individual brane to act in the way described by sen s effective action the typical seperation between branes within the compact directions would have to be larger than @xmath50 .",
    "pairs @xcite . ] a miminal , although _ ad hoc _ , setting is to take @xmath51 to be equal to the number of string length size volumes within the compact space , i.e. @xmath74 then it is possible to fulfill the above requirements with @xmath75 , @xmath76 , corresponding to a very large number of branes ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "this initial condition is quite baroque and at first sight rather unattractive .",
    "however we take note that such a large number is not foreign to speculations on the ds / cft correspondence @xcite , which suggests that the number of light degrees of freedom of the putative euclidean cft dual to the inflationary phase of the universe should be very large @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "one last issue we would like to comment on is that of reheating at the end of inflation . in this paper",
    "our approach has been rather phenomenological .",
    "we took sen s equation of state together with a string - theory motivated effective potential . both ingredients rest on quite severe approximations , but are supposed to capture at least some of the physics of tachyon condensation .",
    "remarkable features are that 1 ) the minimum of the tachyon potential is at @xmath79 and that 2 ) the energy of the brane stays confined to its hyperplane in the form of a pressureless fluid . as far as we understand , the first feature is supposed to be generic .",
    "as has been recently emphasized by kovman and linde @xcite , this is quite worrisome for the purpose of reheating the universe at the end of inflation .",
    "they also note that this is potentially a problem for _ all _ string - inspired models of inflation based on the annihilation or decay of branes .    from a phenomenological point of view the simplest resolution would be to have a potential that vanishes at finite @xmath1 so that reheating can proceed through oscillations of the tachyon fluid around its minimum .",
    "either way , this raises the issue of the decay of the tachyon fluid .",
    "the standard lore in the string - community is that unstable d - branes should ultimately decay into closed string modes . to make this process manifest",
    "one should take into account @xmath13 corrections to the tachyon effective action , a program which has not been completed yet .",
    "we believe that a related issue will be to understand the precise nature of the tachyon fluid at the minimum of the potential .",
    "it is expected to be stable only in the limit @xmath80@xcite and should in principle be a good zeroth order approximation to the problem of tachyon matter decay .",
    "an intruiging characteristic of sen s effective action is that at the minimum of the potential , the tachyon fluid equations of motions reduced to , in hamiltonian form and in flat space - time , @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the momentum conjugate to @xmath5 .",
    "these are precisely the equation of motion of a relativistic pressureless fluid of partons of mass unity , with velocity field @xmath83 and energy density @xmath84 .",
    "solutions of these equations of motions are quite trivial to work out",
    ". a time - independent but otherwise arbitrary configuration of the energy - density @xmath85 corresponds in the parton picture to a bunch of massive partons _ at rest_. however , generic solutions have caustic singularities and the free parton picture has probably a limited range .",
    "it makes nevertheless clear why there are no propagating tachyon waves at the minimum of the potential , simply because there are no collective excitations in a pressureless fluid .    in the limit of @xmath86 ,",
    "the tachyon fluid is stable and behaves as some new form of dark matter .",
    "the problem with this is that the universe would never become radiation dominated and for tachyon matter to be relevant in cosmology requires some fine - tuning @xcite .",
    "for finite @xmath13 however tachyon matter should be unstable and decay .",
    "if we are willing to take the parton picture seriously , it is plausible that their decay could solve the issue of reheating of the universe at the end of tachyon rolling , however , not being string theorists , we have no idea how this question could be addressed .",
    "as an illustration we simply parametrize the decay rate as @xmath87 the reheat temperature is then ( presumably over- ) estimated to be t_rh~ ~()^g_s^m_pl which for generic powers of @xmath88 is high enough for most cosmological puposes .",
    "obviously it would be interesting , both for string theory and for phenomenological applications to develop further insights on this issue .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the possibility of using sen s equation of state to see if we can obtain viable cosmological inflation .",
    "we have described the conditions which the potential and the tachyon mass must fulfil in order to provide enough e - folds of inflation and density perturbations of the correct magnitude .",
    "our approach has been essentially phenomenological . in particular , the conditions for slow - roll are essentially independent of the precise shape of the potential and whether it vanishes at finite or infinite @xmath1 .",
    "one attractive feature of sen s equation of state is that it give an explicit realization of so - called k - inflation @xcite .",
    "a related interesting property is that the exit from inflation is automatic for generic string - inspired effective potentials due to the limiting value @xmath89 for homogeneous configurations .",
    "as already emphasized numerous times a straightforward matching with string theory is problematic but perhaps not altogether impossible .",
    "an important issue , both for cosmological applications and , we presume , for string theory is to understand the ultimate fate of the tachyon matter at the bottom of the potential .",
