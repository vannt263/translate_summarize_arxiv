    "since the end of the eighties and by this time works on designing and development of physical programs for @xmath0 and @xmath1 - colliders are under development in different countries .",
    "now there are projects on their creation in usa [ 1 ] , germany [ 2 ] , japan [ 3 ] .",
    "physical programs for these colliders created as a result of long - term cooperation of the representatives of many high - energy physics centres are stated in `` conceptual design reports '' [ 1 - 3 ] . in these projects electron - photon and photon - photon beams",
    "are supposed to be obtained on the basis of linear accelerators with @xmath2 beams .",
    "one of the best methods of obtaining intensive @xmath3 beams is the use of the compton backscattering of laser light on an electron beam of the linear collider .",
    "for the first time in works [ 4 ] it was shown , that on the basis of linear colliders with @xmath2 beams it is possible to realize @xmath4 and @xmath5 - beams with approximately the same energies and luminosities , as for initial electron beams .",
    "the necessary intensive bunches of @xmath6 quantums were offered for receiving at scattering of powerful laser flash on electron bunches of these accelerators .",
    "the small sizes of linear colliders beams make it possible to obtain conversion coefficient ( the attitude of number of high - energy photons to number of electrons in a bunch ) @xmath7 at energy of laser flash in some joules , i.e. it is possible to convert the most part of electrons to photons .    the detailed description of the scheme of an electron beam conversion in @xmath6 beam , the basic characteristics of @xmath8 and @xmath9 collisions , problems of a background and calibration of luminosity were considered in detail in [ 5 ] .",
    "the region of laser conversion @xmath10 is unique by its physical properties .",
    "it is the region of an intensive electromagnetic field ( the focused laser bunch ) .",
    "this fact allows one to investigate such processes of nonlinear quantum electrodynamics as radiation of a photon by electron in a field of an intensive electromagnetic wave , and also `` subthreshold '' pairs production @xcite .    at sufficient power of laser flash in the field of conversion",
    "the processes are essential due to absorption from a wave more than one of laser photons simultaneously @xmath11 @xmath12    processes ( [ 1]),([2 ] ) represent nonlinear by intensity of a field processes of interaction electrons and photons with a field of an electromagnetic wave .",
    "the first of these nonlinear processes results in expansion of spectra of high - energy photons and occurrence of additional peaks in spectra of scattered radiation due to absorption of several photons from a wave , and the second one effectively reduces a threshold of @xmath2 pairs creation .",
    "the interaction of electrons and positrons with a field of an electromagnetic wave results in effective increase of their masses ] : @xmath13 which is characterized by parameter of intensity of a laser wave @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16- density of photons in a laser wave , @xmath17 - their energy , @xmath18 - amplitude of classical 4-potential of electromagnetic wave , @xmath19 - a charge of electron .",
    "regular research of nonlinear breit - wheeler ( [ 2 ] ) and compton ( [ 1 ] ) processes was carried out in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "now the area of nonlinear effects is rather actual and is of great interest because here essential are the processes of radiation due to absorption from a wave of a few of photons , and their probabilities are essentially nonlinear functions of intensity of a field . recently on accelerator slac @xcite a series of experiments e-144 with check of predictions of nonlinear qed was finished in the field of parameter @xmath20 that became possible due to use of the supershort and rigidly focused laser pulses .",
    "thus for the first time the experiment was set up in which the process of @xmath2 - pair production at participation of only real , instead of virtual photons was carried out .",
    "the main features of the conversion are described by a quantity @xmath21 which is determined via the initial electron beam energy @xmath22 and the laser photon energy @xmath23 as @xmath24 the differential probability of process of radiation of a photon by electron performed by a summation over polarizations of final electron and a photon has the following form @xcite :    @xmath25    @xmath26,\\ ] ] @xmath27,\\ ] ] @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 is the bessel functions of nth order , @xmath31 is energy of high - energy photon .    the expression in the sum ( [ 5 ] ) ,",
    "determines probability of radiation of n- harmonics by electron in a field of circular -polarized electromagnetic wave ( from a wave n laser photons can be absorbed ) .",
    "the change of a variable @xmath32 corresponds to the change of a variable @xmath33 : @xmath34 @xmath35 the influence of nonlinear effects results in the fact that the maximum energy of high - energy photons of the first harmonic @xmath36 decreases in comparison with the maximum energy of photons in usual compton effect and the energy of the @xmath6 - quanta formed at absorption from a wave of several photons exceeds energy , achievable in usual copmton effect .     and various values of parameter @xmath37 , @xmath38,title=\"fig : \" ]   and various values of parameter @xmath37 , @xmath38,title=\"fig : \" ]    results of numerical calculations of power spectra of photons in a nonlinear case at @xmath39",
    "are given in fig 1 .",
    "apparently from these figures , the account of nonlinear effects results in essential change of spectra in comparison with spectra of usual copmton scattering .",
    "first , simultaneous absorption from a wave of several laser photons results in expansion of spectra of rigid @xmath40 quanta and occurrence of the additional peaks , appropriate to radiation of harmonics of higher order .",
    "this expansion at the same parameter x increases with the intensity of a wave .",
    "second , effective electron weighting results in compression of spectra , i.e.in shift of the first harmonic aside smaller values y. with increase of parameter x compression of the first harmonic decreases .",
    "the process discussed in this section , is the good test on check of nonlinear quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the `` hard '' photons propagated in the region of laser conversion can produce @xmath2 pairs in collision with s laser photons simultaneously @xmath41 threshold value for energy of a photon is defined from the relation @xmath42 here @xmath43 , @xmath44 - 4- momentum of photons @xmath40 and @xmath45 .",
    "the maximum energy of compton photon emitted at interaction of electron with n laser photons is @xmath46 thus the corresponding value of electron energy for @xmath47 pairs creation at absorption from a laser wave s of photons is @xmath48 in particular if the `` hard '' photon is emitted as a result of interaction with one laser photon@xmath49 @xmath50 when @xmath51 electron - positron pairs will be created only due to nonlinear processes qed .",
    "thus at the first stage of realization of projects nlc ( in particular for tesla ) at x=4.5 occurrence of the big number of positrons will be a consequence of nonlinear effects qed",
    ".    calculated in @xcite the probability of @xmath2 pair production at interaction with circle - polarized laser photons can be submitted by the high - energy non - polarized photon as @xmath52    @xmath53 \\biggl]\\ ] ] @xmath54    the total number of the produced positrons can be obtained by averaging on an energy spectrum of compton photons ( [ 5 ] ) @xmath55 here @xmath56 .",
    "expression ( [ 7 ] ) contains two factors 1/2 .",
    "the first one arises at the account of relative movement of bunches of photons @xmath40 and @xmath45 .",
    "the same multiplier appears because of the fact that photons interact in the average with the half of a laser bunch ( the length of a laser pulse does not exceed the sizes of area of conversion and distribution of density of bunches in a direction of movement is homogeneous ) . in fig .",
    "2 the number of the created positrons per one electron is shown depending on x at various values of parameter @xmath57 , value of factor of conversion @xmath58 , the length of a laser bunch @xmath59 .",
    "at the first stage of project tesla will be observed @xmath60 pairs per one collision .",
    "these pairs will form the essential background , therefore the produced positrons should be removed from the region of interaction with the help of a magnetic field . to observe the process of creation of pairs it is necessary to extract the positrons moving practically along the direction of initial electrons .",
    "we shall consider distribution on energy of the created positrons .",
    "energies of positrons ( electrons ) are distributed in the interval    @xmath61    from here it is easy to get restricts of distribution of positrons on energy @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64    table    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     this table represents borders of positrons energies for various number s of the absorbed laser photons , parameter @xmath65 .",

    "we show the same distributions , but averaged in the spectrum of high - energy photons . in fig . 4a and 4b distributions for energy of electrons",
