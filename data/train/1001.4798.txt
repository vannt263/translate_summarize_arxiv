    "recent observational advances in x - ray astrophysics have led to a new high - energy perspective on the interstellar medium and star - forming regions ( sfrs ) .",
    "the x - ray point sources in sfrs comprise pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars as well as massive stars . sometimes , x - ray emission from deeply embedded young stellar objects ( yso ) is observed , albeit such observations remain rare @xcite .",
    "it is now firmly established that the shocked winds of young massive ob stars contribute to the heating of interstellar matter up to @xmath11mk @xcite . in older massive stellar aggregates , the combined action of stellar winds and supernova explosions results in powerful cluster winds and associated superbubbles @xcite .",
    "higher temperatures ( up to 100mk ) are observed in these objects .",
    "hot , x - ray - emitting gas is present around massive stars and fills the large volumes of star clusters , and , in some cases beyond .",
    "there is a small group of sfrs where hard , sometimes non - thermal x - ray emission is observed . in cases",
    "when strong fluorescent lines are seen in the spectra , the emission is explained by the presence of a recent supernova remnant ( snr ) and its interaction with the cool dense material of a nearby molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "however , in some prominent sfrs , such as rcw38 , the non - thermal x - ray emission can not be easily explained unless the presence of magnetic fields is assumed @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields , along with turbulence , play an important role in star formation @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields were directly measured in m17 @xcite and orion @xcite , and are predicted to be a common feature in sfrs @xcite . if accelerated particles are present in the same volume , synchrotron emission would naturally occur .",
    "a region within a few arcminutes of the oh maser on2 in cygnusx is an established site of ongoing massive star formation .",
    "following the literature we refer to this whole sfr as on2 @xcite .",
    "this region is located within the well - studied massive star cluster berkeley87 .",
    "one of the most interesting members of berkeley87  is the wo type star wr142 .",
    "only three stars of this spectral type are known in the galaxy , and the wo star in berkeley87  is the closest among them .",
    "stars of this spectral type represent the evolutionary stage immediately before the supernova or @xmath2-ray burst explosion , and drive the fastest stellar winds among all stars .",
    "berkeley 87 traditionally attracts the attention of high - energy astrophysics as a potential site of particle acceleration .",
    "therefore , sfr on2 provides an ideal laboratory to study the interactions between and the massive star feedback .    in this paper",
    "we present our _ xmm - newton _  observations of the field encompassing on2 and berkeley87 , and provide their analysis and interpretation .",

    "@xmath1330 - 50kyr ) and the high luminosities inferred for the ysos ( 5000 , 430 , and 330 ) they suggest that a near - simultaneous massive star formation event occurred in this region @xmath14yr ago .",

    "on2 is located in the cygnus region , and thus we are looking tangentially to the orion local spiral arm and observe numerous objects at different distances @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate the distance to on2 as 5.5kpc , while @xcite argue that on2 is located at the same distance as the cluster berkeley87 and is physically connected with this cluster .",
    "@xcite obtained new photometric measurements of stars in berkeley87  and derived a distance of @xmath16pc .",

    "@xcite notice that a trunk - like zone of heavy obscuration seen in fig.[fig : ris ] corresponds spatially with a co clouds belonging to the cygnusx complex .",
    "in a recent study @xcite show that the uv radiation from the clusters within the cygnus ob1 association , including berkeley87 , affects the molecular cloud complex in the cygnusx south region , and note that a distance between 1.1 and 1.3kpc is favored from o stars spectroscopy .",
    "this supports the likely association between berkeley87 and on2 .",
    "berkeley87  is a relatively sparse , moderately reddened cluster , whose members represent some of the key stages in the evolution of massive stars . the most intriguing is a wo - type star , wr142 .",
    "analysis of its x - ray observations was presented in @xcite .",

    "@xcite is located immediately south of on2s .",
    "the history of berkeley87  is not well understood .",
    "the ages of ob stars , the wo star , and the red supergiant star are in apparent disagreement with an evolution within a nearly coeval cluster .",
    "@xcite found that 27% of the young galactic massive clusters contain wr and ( rsg ) members , and that such clusters must be older than 4myr .",
    "moreover , wc / wo stars can co - exist with rsg stars only during a short time interval of @xmath18yr .",
    "@xcite studied berkeley87  among other galactic open clusters .",
    "they suggested that ob stars in berkeley87  were formed within the time span of @xmath191myr and are coeval with wr142 at 3.2myr . using evolutionary tracks of schaller  ( 1992 )",
    ", they estimate the initial mass of wr142  as @xmath20@xmath21 . in the meantime",
    ", the initial mass of bccyg is @xmath22@xcite .",
    "a star of such mass must be older than 6.4myr when it reaches rsg stage @xcite .",
    "this apparent contradiction can be resolved with stellar evolutionary models that account for rotation @xcite .",
    "we have recently found indications that wr142  may be a fast rotator @xcite . in fast rotating stars ,",
    "the rsg stage will occur earlier , perhaps even during the h - burning stage , while the wo stage occurs later compared to the non - rotating models .",
    "therefore , the simultaneous presence of a rsg and a wo star can be explained if berkeley87  is @xmath134 - 6myr old .    assuming that the most massive star in berkeley87  has an initial mass higher than 80  and the universal initial mass function ( imf )",
    ", we estimate that about 30 stars with initial mass more than 10@xmath21 should be present in berkeley87 .",

    "the only way to reconcile these earlier results with the o5 spectral type derived from the 2mass magnitudes and x - ray spectroscopy is to assume that the x - ray source is embedded deeper than the ionizing stars .",
    "note that this conclusion is independent of the adopted distance .",
    "thus , there are good arguments that the ionizing stars in gal75.84 + 0.40 are not the main source of the observed x - ray emission : the x - ray source is deeper embedded , extended , and hard or non - thermal .",
    "the x - rays in gal75.84 + 0.40 fill a nearly circular area , with no obvious ir source being correlated with its center ( see fig[fig : abx ] ) .",
    "one of the possibilities to explain this can be an embedded cluster of young stars behind the hii  region , which we observe in projection , and which is the source of x - ray emission .",
    "however , given the small linear extension of the x - ray source ( 0.1pc ) and the character of its spectrum , a cluster of pre - main sequence stars seems to be an unlikely explanation . albeit some contribution from point sources is possible , we believe that a truely diffuse component is present in gal75.84 + 0.40 .",
    "only a handful of star - forming regions with similar properties of x - ray emission is presently known ( see table[tab : hxr ] ) .",

    "therefore , it is not possible to attribute the diffuse x - ray emission from on2s to the cluster wind .    if indeed the molecular cloud onsala2c and the adjacent star - forming region on2 are immediate neighbors of the cluster berkeley87 , whose intra - cluster medium is filled with hot tenuous wind , the situation may be analogous to the one considered by @xcite for the evaporation of a cool cloud in a hot gas . for a spherical cloud",
    ", the solutions of @xcite predict that the temperature rises steadily with the distance @xmath101 from the cold cloud ( @xmath102 ) and the x - ray emission forms a `` halo '' around the cool cloud ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "broadly speaking , the thermal conduction would lower the temperature and increase the x - ray luminosity of the hot gas close to the interface @xcite .    there are , however , a number of arguments against attributing the x - ray emission from on2s to the thermal evaporation of cool cloud material .",
    "the observed x - ray temperature at the interface between cool and hot gas appears to be unreasonably high ( @xmath103mk ) .",
    "moreover , the diffuse x - ray emission is localized in small areas , while the interface between cool and hot gas in berkeley87  extends over parsecs ( see sketch in fig.[fig : ris ] ) .",

    "the location of berkeley87  in the complex region of the cygnusx superbubble makes the detection of an individual bubble around berkeley87  even more difficult .",
    "thus we conclude that stellar winds can not be the main reason for the observed apparently diffuse emission .",
    "diffuse hard x - ray emission with a power - law spectrum can be produced by the synchrotron mechanism .",
    "the latter requires the presence of energetic particles and magnetic fields .",
    "it has been argued that the shocks in the cluster winds and/or colliding wind binaries efficiently accelerate electrons and protons to relativistic energies @xcite .",
    "the model calculations by @xcite show that particles up to tev energies should be present in berkeley87 .",
    "these particles should be advected from the cluster on the time scale of @xmath108yr .",
    "a simple scaling relations to estimate the expected surface brightness of the synchrotron emission from the cluster of massive stars were derived by @xcite and applied to the cluster in the central parsec of the galaxy .",
    "berkeley87  is less rich than the galactic center cluster , but it contains wr142 , a wo star that alone has the wind kinetic energy @xmath109erg s@xmath7 , making it comparable to the whole of the galactic center cluster . the small number of ob stars in berkeley87  results in the order of two lower uv luminosity , thus the cooling of particles by inverse compton process is less significant . according to the scaling relations of @xcite , the surface brightness of berkeley87  in @xmath2-rays is @xmath110 lower than that of the central cluster .",
    "it is interesting to note that the winds from the dense group of three ob stars south of the on2s ( see sketch in fig.[fig : ris ] ) may provide an additional source of particles accelerated _ in situ _ nearby to on2s .",
    "to estimate at which distance from the stars the winds terminate and shock the hii  gas , we consider a typical o star wind density profile which declines with distance as @xmath111 . the wind density close to the surface of an o star",

    "recently , @xcite addressed the effect of a random magnetic field on synchrotron emission . in",
    "was shown ( in the context of young supernova remnants ) that prominent localized structures can appear in synchrotron maps of extended sources with random magnetic fields , even if the particle distribution is smooth .",
    "the bright structures originate as high - energy electrons radiate efficiently in local enhancements of the magnetic field .",
    "the size of the `` patch '' of hard x - ray emission in on2s is about 0.1pc@xmath78 .",

    "these measurements provide strong support to the idea that magnetic fields of similar strengths can be present in other , if not all , sfrs , with on2s being no exception .",
    "@xcite reviewed several recent observational studies of the relationships between magnetic fields , stellar feedback , and the geometry of hii  regions .",
    "the observations reveal that magnetic field lines can be preferentially aligned perpendicular to the long axis of the quiescent cloud before stars form .",
    "after star formation and push - back occurs , ionized gas will be constrained to flow along the field lines and escapes from the system in directions perpendicular to the long axis .",
    "wave motions may be associated with the field and so could contribute a turbulent component to the observed line profiles .",
    "it appears that all ingredients required to produce a small bright patch of synchrotron radiation in the x - ray image may be present in on2s .",
    "the particles accelerated up to tev energies may result from the shocked cluster winds and/or from the yso outflows . sufficiently strong turbulent magnetic fields may be present in the vicinity of star forming regions .",
    "in addition , the presence of clumps of matter would enhance the surface brightness of the radiation @xcite , and such clumps of matter are present in the radio maps of the region @xcite . to summarize",
    ", a synchrotron emission may be expected from the region where the strongly shocked stellar winds and turbulent magnetic fields co - exist .",
    "in table[tab : hxr ] we expand the list compiled by @xcite to summarize the properties of high - mass star forming regions with detected hard diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "it can be immediately seen that the properties of sfrs in table[tab : hxr ] are quite diverse .",
    "it appears that three broad categories can be distinguished .",
    "the superbubbles around large clusters and associations of massive stars belong to one of these categories .",
    "large spatial scale ( 10100pc ) , high luminosity , and often limb brighten morphology are characteristic for objects such as 30dorc , lmcn11 , lmcn51d .",
    "the star clusters blowing cluster winds belong to the second category .",
    "the examples include westerlund1 , the arches , and ngc3603",
    ". although their x - ray emission is hard , it can , usually be fitted with hot ( @xmath116mk ) thermal plasma .",
    "the diffuse x - rays fill the cluster interior on the scale of a few pc . in the third group , where , as we believe on2 belongs , small scale areas ( @xmath117pc ) are filled with diffuse x - rays . in such sfrs as on2 , rcw38 , wr49a , or sgr2 , the hot ( @xmath118mk ) or non - thermal plasma",
    "is found in immediate vicinity of uchii  regions .",
    "while @xcite and @xcite suggest that hard x - rays may originate from unresolved populations of low - mass pre - main sequence stars , we suggest , that at least in some objects , the non - thermal emission may be expected from interactions between magnetic fields and the particle accelerated in shocked stellar winds .    it is interesting to note that the distribution of hard extended x - ray emission in the two closest sfrs  orion nebula and on2s  is somewhat similar : diffuse x - ray emission filling a cavity seen in the ir images , slightly offset from a small group of massive stars .",
    "the x - ray spectrum , however is noticeably harder in the case of on2s .",
    "throughout the paper we adopted the distance @xmath119kpc to both the young massive star cluster berkeley87 and the sfr on2 . this assumption has allowed us to propose physical interaction between the radiative and mechanical feedback from ob stars in berkeley87 and the observed diffuse x - ray emission in the regions of active star formation .    in the majority of papers published on the sfr on2 , a distance in excess of 4kpc is adopted . in this case , there would be no physical connection between the massive star cluster and the sfr .",

    "<S> the _ xmm - newton _  observations detected x - rays from massive stars in berkeley87  as well as diffuse emission from the sfr on2 . the two patches of diffuse x - ray emission are encompassed in the shell - like hii  region gal75.84 + 0.40 in the northern part of on2 and in the on2s region in the southern part of on2 . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse emission from gal75.84 + 0.40 suffers an absorption column equivalent to @xmath0mag . its spectrum can be fitted either with a thermal plasma model at @xmath1mk or by an absorbed power - law model with @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> we discuss different explanations for the apparently diffuse x - ray emission in these sfrs . </S>",
    "<S> these include synchrotron radiation , invoked by the co - existence of strongly shocked stellar winds and turbulent magnetic fields in the star - forming complex , cluster wind emission , or an unresolved population of point sources . </S>"
