    "a _ rectangular layout _ @xmath0 is a partition of a rectangle @xmath4 into a set @xmath5 of disjoint smaller rectangles by vertical and horizontal line segments so that no four smaller rectangles meet at the same point . for a plane graph @xmath1",
    ", we say a rectangular layout @xmath0 _ represents _ @xmath1 if the following hold : ( 1 ) the set of smaller rectangles of @xmath0 one - to - one corresponds to the set of vertices of @xmath1 ; and ( 2 ) two vertices @xmath6 and @xmath7 are adjacent in @xmath1 if and only if their corresponding rectangles in @xmath0 share a common boundary .",
    "in other words , if @xmath0 represents @xmath1 , then @xmath1 is the dual graph of @xmath0 .",
    "an _ area assignment function _ of @xmath8 is a function @xmath9 .",
    "we say a rectangular layout @xmath0 is a _ rectangular cartogram _ for @xmath1 with respect to @xmath10 if @xmath0 represents @xmath1 and , for every @xmath11 , the area of the rectangle in @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath6 equals to @xmath12 .",
    "we also say @xmath0 _ realizes _ the area assignment function @xmath10 .",
    "the concept of the rectangular cartograms was introduced by raisz in 1934 as a way of visualizing spacial information , such as population or economic output , of geographic regions @xcite : each rectangle @xmath13 in @xmath0 represents a geographic region ; the positioning and adjacencies of these rectangles are chosen to suggest their geographic locations to the viewer ; while their areas are chosen to represent the numeric values being represented by the cartogram .",
    "heuristic algorithms for computing pre - specified rectangle area for a given rectangular layout were presented in @xcite",
    ".    often , more than one quantity are to be displayed as a cartogram for the same set of geographic regions .",
    "the first three figures in @xcite , for example , are cartograms of land area , population , and wealth within the united states . to make the visual comparison of multiple related cartograms easier , it is desirable that their underlying rectangular layouts are _ combinatorially equivalent _ ( to be defined later ) , although the relative sizes of smaller rectangles will differ . fig [ fig : layout ] ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) show two combinatorially equivalent layouts with different area assignments .",
    "this naturally raises the question : when is this possible ?",
    "the following notion was introduced in @xcite .",
    "a rectangular layout @xmath0 is _ area - universal _ for a plane graph @xmath1 if @xmath0 represents @xmath1 and , for any area - assignment function @xmath10 of @xmath1 , there is a layout @xmath14 that is _ combinatorially equivalent _ to @xmath0 and is a cartogram of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "area - universal rectangular layouts are useful for side - by - side display of cartograms with different data on the same set of regions .",
    "in addition , it has applications in a number of other fields @xcite .",
    "for example , area - universal layouts have applications in vlsi circuit design @xcite .",
    "the rectangles in a rectangular layout @xmath0 represent circuit components , and the common boundary between rectangles in @xmath0 model the connections between components .",
    "in early vlsi design stage , the chip area requirements of circuit components are not known yet .",
    "thus , at this stage , only the relative position of the circuit components are considered . at later design stages , the areas of components ( namely , the rectangles in @xmath0 ) are specified .",
    "an area - universal layout @xmath0 enables the realization of the area assignments specified at later design stages .",
    "thus , the ability of finding an area - universal layout for @xmath1 at the early design stage will greatly simplify design process at later stages . as another example , in building design , it is desirable to be able to determine the areas of different rooms according to their function @xcite . and , in tree - map visualizations , alternative area - universal layouts may be of use in controlling rectangle aspect ratios @xcite .",
    "this raises the next natural question : what kind layouts are area - universal ?",
    "this problem was studied in @xcite .",
    "a nice characterization of area - universal rectangular layouts was discovered in @xcite :    @xmath15[thm : universal ] a rectangular layout @xmath16 is area - universal if and only if every maximal line segment in @xmath16 is a side of at least one rectangle in @xmath0 .    in fig",

    "some of them may be area - universal , while the others are not .",
    "not every plane graph has an area - universal layout . in @xcite",
    ", rinsma described an outerplanar graph @xmath1 and an area assignment to its vertices such that no rectangular layout realizes the area assignment .",
