    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) represent the last stages of evolution for low- and intermediate - mass stars of masses less than about 8 solar masses .",
    "the pn phase begins when the central contracting white dwarf reaches an effective temperature of above 30,000 k and starts to ionize the gaseous envelope ejected during the previous asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "the pn phase is short , lasting for just tens of thousands years maximally .",
    "pne enrich the interstellar medium ( ism ) with dust grains , helium , carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and other products of nucleosynthesis , and are vital probes of the stellar nucleosynthesis processes , abundance gradients and chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "in addition , pne play a key role in studying the physics and time - scales of mass - loss and stellar evolution for low- and intermediate - mass stars ( iben 1995 ) .",
    "pne may also be progenitors of type ia supernovae that return large amounts of iron to the ism .",
    "new pne have been continually discovered via various surveys ( parker et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the strasbourg - eso catalog of galactic planetary nebulae ( secgpn ) compiled by acker et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1996 ) contains @xmath0  1,500 true , probable or possible pne .",
    "kohoutek ( 2001 ) lists @xmath0  1,500 objects classified as galactic pne known up to the end of 1999 , as well as a number of possible pre - pne and post - pne . using the the anglo - australian observatory uk schmidt telescope ( aao / ukst ) supercosmos h@xmath4 survey ( shs ; parker et al .",

    "( 2009a , b ) discover several pn candidates .",
    "jacoby et al . ( 2010 ) describe a technique to search for additional unknown pne via visually inspecting the existing data collections of the digital sky surveys ( dss ) such as the poss - i and poss - ii surveys , and find tens of new pne . up to now",
    ", there are in total less than 2,850 true or probable pne known in the milky way ( miszalski et al .",
    "2012 ) . however , the number is still a small fraction of the total predicted by any pn population model .",
    "for example , the stellar population synthesis models of moe & de marco ( 2006 ) predict a total number of 46,000 @xmath5 13,000 pne with radii @xmath6 0.9 pc in the milky way if all low- and intermediate - mass stars of 1 - 8 solar mass will go through a pn phase .",
    "the number drops to @xmath0  6,600 if all pne have to form via the channel of close binaries ( through the common envelope phase ) ( de marco & moe 2005 ) .",
    "observationally , based on a solar neighborhood ( @xmath6 2 kpc ) sample of about 200 pne , frew ( 2008 ) estimates a total galactic population of 24,000 @xmath5 4,000 pne of radii @xmath6 1.5 pc , or 13,000 @xmath5 2,000 pne of radii @xmath6 0.9 pc .",
    "a variety of multi - waveband observations ranging from the radio up to the x - ray have been utilized to detect pne .",
    "essentially , all the efforts have been based on the technique of wide field , interference filter or objective prism slitless spectroscopic imaging surveys , primarily searching for emission in the light of the [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 line and/or h@xmath4 . however , it is a very challenging task to to find all pne in the galaxy directly .",
    "firstly , since most pne are distributed in the galactic plane where dust extinction is high , a large fraction of them are unobservable at optical wavelengths where pne are most luminous . secondly , when only imaging data are available , it is difficult to differentiate pne from other diffuse emission line nebulae such as hii  regions , supernova remnants , nova shells , symbiotic nebulae and distant emission line galaxies .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) provides uniform and contiguous imaging photometry for about one - third of the sky in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands , as well as over two million high quality low resolution optical spectra of stars , galaxies and quasars .",
    "the latest sdss data release 9 ( dr9 ; ahn et al .",
    "2012 ) delivers spectra for about 1.46 million galaxies , 0.23 million quasars and 0.67 million stars .",
    "the sdss observations mainly target high galactic latitude regions of the northern and southern galactic caps .",
    "if by chance a pn ( or an extended emission line nebula of other types ) falls in the sightline of some sdss targets ( including sky background targets by sky fibers ) , lines emitted by the nebula , such as the [ o  iii ]  @xmath14959 , 5007 , typically the strongest for a medium to high excitation nebula , will appear in the spectra of those targets .",
    "then by systematically searching and measuring the [ o  iii ]  @xmath14959 , 5007 emission lines of galactic nebular origins in those millions of sdss spectra , one may expect to discover and study previously unknown pne or other types of extended emission line nebula in the galaxy .",
    "this spectroscopic approach has the following advantages : a ) compared to previously commonly used techniques , such as narrow - band imaging and slitless objective prism imaging spectroscopy , the sky background is much reduced in slit or fiber spectroscopy .",
    "thus the latter is much more sensitive to faint nebular emission and capable of detecting large ( evolved and/or nearby ) pne of very low surface brightness ; b ) with spectral information available over a wide wavelength coverage , it is much easier to differentiate different types of emission line nebulae ; and c ) with a contiguous and uniform coverage over a huge sky area such as that provided by the sdss , it is possible to construct a statistically meaningful sample to improve the census of galactic pne .    in this paper",
    ", we present results of a systematic search for pne in the sdss spectroscopic database .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the data and method used to search for pne .",
    "the results are presented in section 3 and discussed in section 4 .",
    "a brief summary then follows in section 5 .",
    "we used the sdss dr7 ( abazajian et al . 2009 ) spectroscopic database in the current work .",
    "the release contains over 1.6 million low - resolution ( @xmath9 ) spectra targeting approximately 930,000 galaxies , 120,000 quasars , 460,000 stars and 97,000 blank sky positions .",
    "most targets are within a large contiguous area over 7,350 deg@xmath10 in the northern galactic cap , with the remaining ones from a number of stripes in the southern galactic cap and a few stripes across the galactic plane targeted by the program of the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ; yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the sdss are usually undertaken in non - photometric conditions when the imaging camera is not in use .",
    "at least three fifteen - minute exposures are taken until the cumulative mean signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) per pixel exceeds 4 for a fiducial fiber magnitude of @xmath11 = 20.2 and @xmath12 = 19.9 .",
    "for faint segue plates , a total exposure time of about 1.5 hours is required .",
    "a total number of 640 spectra are collected simultaneously covering 3,800  9,200 , at a spectral resolution of @xmath0  1,800 .",
    "the large aperture size of the sdss telescope ( 2.5 meter ) and the long exposures ( @xmath13  45 minutes ) make the sdss spectra extremely sensitive to narrow nebular emission lines . note that each sdss fiber samples a sky area of angular diameter of 3   and the sdss wavelength scale is based on vacuum wavelengths .      for each spectrum from the sdss dr7 spectroscopic database",
    ", we have performed gaussian fitting to the [ o  iii ]  @xmath14959 , 5007 lines around their rest wavelengths .",
    "the two lines are fitted independently . to reduce the degrees of freedom of fit ,",
    "we have adopted a fixed line width of fwhm 2.82  and assumed a flat continuum in the vicinity of both lines .",
    "when a positive signal is detected , the snr of the detection is then computed by dividing the peak value of the fitted gaussian by the standard deviation of a segment spectrum of a wavelength span of 40 around the rest wavelength of the line .",
    "note that the snrs thus calculated are lower limits of the true values . in cases of very strong signals",
    ", the snrs would be greatly under - estimated .    to minimize spurious detections",
    ", we require that : a ) snrs of the [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 line should be higher than 3 ; b ) the difference of radial velocities deduced from the two [ o  iii ]  @xmath14959 , 5007 lines must be smaller than 60  km s@xmath14 ; c ) the intensity ratio of the two lines @xmath15/@xmath16 must fall between 2 and 4 , bracketing the intrinsic ratio of 2.98 ( mathis & liu 1999 ; storey & zeippen 2000 ) .",
    "the [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 line emission from galactic pne may be contaminated by emission lines ( e.g. the [ o  ii ]  @xmath13726 , 3729 lines , the balmer lines and the [ o  iii ]  @xmath14959 , 5007 lines ) of target galaxies and quasars .",
    "such cases are also carefully avoided by visual check of the sdss images and spectra to remove nearby galaxies whose [ o  iii ]   emission lines are regarded as galactic emission and distant galaxies and quasars that have an emission line shifted to the wavelength of the [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 line .",
    "faint background emission line galaxies at a given redshift , such as [ o  ii ]  emission line galaxies at redshift about 0.35 and ly@xmath4  emitters at redshift about 3.1 , are important contaminations for pne surveys beyond the milky way ( e.g. gerhard 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "to further avoid such contaminations , we have excluded a few pn candidates whose [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 line widths are larger than 4.23  ( 1.5 times the expected line width ) .",
    "these measures have lessened the extragalactic contamination in our work .",
    "the radial velocities of the pn candidates ( see fig.14 in section4 ) also suggest their galactic origins , as extragalactic origins would result a uniform radial velocity distribution . in addition",
    ", we find a few cases that some spectral features of a normal galaxy at a given redshift , such as the 4661  feature at redshift around 0.074 and the 4819  feature at redshift about 0.039 , can mimic the [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 emission .",
    "such cases are also excluded .",
    "detection of the [ o  iii ]  @xmath14959 , 5007 lines is a good indicatation but not sufficient to identify a pn .",
    "the pn candidates found in this work may be contaminated by reflection nebulae , diffuse ionized gas , hii  regions , supernova remnants , emission line stars and nova shells ( frew & parker 2010 ) .",
    "imaging data , particularly narrow - band images , can provide important clues to classify the pn candidates .",
    "therefore , both the sdss spectra and available imaging data are used to help classify the nature of the pn candidates in this work .",
    "after applying the above criteria , a total number of 160 spectra with reliable detections of the galactic [ o  iii ]  @xmath14959 , 5007 emission lines are selected . the spectral sequence number , sdss spectral i d , the type , redshift and equatorial and galactic coordinates of the target , the surface brightness and radial velocity of the detected galactic [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 line of each spectrum are listed in tab.1 .",
    "note the redshifts here indicate the sdss targets and are given by the sdss pipeline .",
    "while the radial velocities are associated the pne or pn candidates and measured from the [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 emission lines in this work .",
    "the sdss spectra and colour - composite thumbnails are displayed in figs.a1 and a2 in the appendix , respectively .",
    "based on the coordinates and radial velocities , they are divided into 58 groups , with each group representing a pn ( candidate ) .",
    "after cross - correlating with existing pn catalogs including secgpn , mash , mash - ii , kohoutek et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and the iphas pn catalog , the 58 groups are further divided into 3 categories : previously known pne or other types of emission line nebulae recovered in this work ( spectral sequence number seq 1  37 ) , pn candidates of multiple [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 detections ( seq 38  123 ) and pn candidates of single detection ( seq 124  160 ) , with each category having 14 , 7 and 37 members , respectively .",
    "their galactic distribution is shown in fig.1 .",
    "as listed in tab.1 , the 160 sdss spectroscopic targets include 59 galaxies ( gal ) , 28 blank skies ( sky ) , 16 blue horizontal - branch stars ( bhb ) , 12 f - turnoff stars ( fto ) , 7 quasars ( qso ) , 9 white dwarfs ( wd ) , 7 x - ray sources from the rosat all - sky survey ( ros ; voges et al .",
    "1999 ) , 7 g - dwarfs ( gd ) , 3 hot stars ( hot ) , plus a few other types of object .",
    "note that the target types are assigned by the sdss .",
    "the fraction of spectra with detectable galactic [ o  iii ]  line emission are 0.007 , 0.004 , 0.006 and 0.016 per cent for target type gal , qso , gd and fto , respectively .",
    "the fractions increase to 0.022 , 0.025 and 0.022 per cent for target type ros , bhb and sky , and further to 0.087 and 0.12 for hot and wd , respectively .",
    "such increases are caused by the facts that it is easier to detect the [ o  iii ]  @xmath14959 , 5007 emission on spectra of blue stars or blank skies and some of the wds and hot stars are exactly the central stars of the pne .",

    ", a widely used method is based on the identification of a complete sample of pne within a local volume and then extrapolating that pn density ( usually relative to either mass or luminosity ) to the entire milky way ( e.g. ishida & weinberger 1987 ; phillips 2002 ; frew 2008 ) .",
    "such method requires knowing distances to the local sample . however , accurate pn distances are very difficult to obtain , resulting uncertainties in the estimated total number of galactic pne of a factor of 2  10 . consequently , this method yields total counts that have a wide spread in values  from 13,000 ( frew 2008 ) to 140,000 ( ishida & weinberger 1987 ) .    with sophisticated modeling of galactic pn population (",
    "e.g. their luminosity and size distributions ) and the sampling effects of the sdss spectroscopic surveys , it is possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the total number of pne in the galaxy without knowing distances of pne .",
