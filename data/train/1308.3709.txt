    "the availability of only two observing epochs , and the large uncertainties on the blob position do not allow us to confirm this result so far .",
    "if this new component is confirmed by further mojave epochs , it will be an indication of a different relation between the knot ejection and the @xmath1-ray activity for sbs0846@xmath0513 in 2009 and 2011 .",
    "the @xmath1-ray activity observed in 2011 and 2012 for sbs0846@xmath0513 could be related to different flaring episodes .",

    "the flux increase in these bands occurs close in time , suggesting that the radio and @xmath1-ray emission may originate in the same part of the jet , likely at large distance from the central engine , where the opacity effects should be less severe .",
    "no new superluminal component has been detected so far that is likely related to this flare .",
    "further high spatial resolution observations of the source are necessary to detect a possible new component ejected at that period .",

    "this could be an indication that the second @xmath1-ray flaring activity was produced close to the bh , where the opacity effects should be more severe , causing a time delay at radio wavelengths .",
    "the presence of a third radio outburst during 2012 december2013 january peaking on 2012 december 30 ( mjd 56291 ; labelled with ( iii ) in fig .",
    "[ mwl ] ) suggests an alternative scenario where the first @xmath1-ray flare in 2012 may is not directly connected with the radio activity observed by ovro 40-m in the same period . in this case , the 2012 may and august @xmath1-ray flaring episodes are related to the radio activity observed at 15 ghz on 2012 october and 2013 january , respectively . in both cases",
    "the peak of the radio emission is delayed with respect to the @xmath1-ray one by @xmath104.5 months .",
    "this delay may be due to opacity in the core region of the source at radio frequencies , suggesting that the @xmath1-ray emission is produced relatively close to the bh in both the 2012 may and august @xmath1-ray flares .",
    "on the basis of the delay between @xmath1-ray emission and radio emission at 15 ghz usually observed in blazar - like objects ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this second scenario seems to be favoured .",
    "taking into account the lack of significant @xmath1-ray emission from sbs0846@xmath0513 between 2011 december and 2012 april , it is difficult to associate the radio activity observed in 2012 may with a previous @xmath1-ray flare .",
    "this further suggests a complex relation between the radio and @xmath1-ray emission in this source .",
    "the 15 ghz light curve is highly variable ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "for this reason we can estimate the variability doppler factor on the basis of the radio data collected during an outburst in a similar manner to that proposed by @xcite .",
    "given the frequent time sampling during the first part of the ovro light curve we can estimate the rise time ( @xmath48 ) of the first flaring episode .",
    "however , the second and third outbursts were not well sampled by the observations , precluding a reliable determination of its variability time - scale .",
    "we consider @xmath48 as the time interval of the flux density variation between the maximum and minimum flux density of a single outburst @xmath49 .",
    "this assumption implies that the minimum flux density corresponds to a stationary underlying component and that the variation is due to a transient component .",
    "on the basis of the causality argument we can derive the brightness temperature and then the variability doppler factor .",

    "<S> two further @xmath1-ray flaring episodes from sbs0846@xmath0513 were observed in 2012 may and august , reaching a daily peak flux integrated above 100 mev of ( 50@xmath212)@xmath310@xmath4 ph @xmath5 s@xmath6 , and ( 73@xmath214)@xmath310@xmath4 ph @xmath5 s@xmath6 on may 24 and august 7 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the most likely scenario suggests that the 2012 may @xmath1-ray flare may not be directly related to the radio activity observed over the same period , while the two @xmath1-ray flaring episodes may be related to the radio activity observed at 15 ghz in 2012 october and 2013 january . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-ray flare in 2012 may triggered _ swift _ observations that confirmed that sbs0846@xmath0513 was also exhibiting high activity in the optical , uv and x - ray bands , thus providing a firm identification between the @xmath1-ray source and the lower - energy counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> we compared the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the flaring state in 2012 may with that of a quiescent state . </S>",
    "<S> the two seds , modelled as an external compton component of seed photons from a dust torus , could be fitted by changing the electron distribution parameters as well as the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> no significant evidence of thermal emission from the accretion disc has been observed . </S>",
