    "the statistical properties of the temperature anisotropies of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation offer a powerful probe of the physics of the primordial universe . in particular the study of non - gaussianity of cmb",
    "is a powerful approach to probe the origin and evolution of structures in the universe ( see , for example , the refs .   and references therein ) . given the far reaching consequences of a convincing detection ( or non - detection ) of primordial non - gaussianity for our description of the physics of the early universe , it is important to employ different statistical tools to quantify its amount , type and the angular scale in order to have information that may be helpful for identifying its causes . apart from revealing features of non - gaussianity",
    ", different statistical estimators can be sensitive to different systematics .",
    "on the other hand , since one does not expect that a single statistical estimator can be sensitive to all possible forms of non - gaussianity that may be present in cmb data , it is important to study the possible deviations from gaussianity by using different statistical tools to identify any non - gaussian signals in the cmb data .",
    "recent analyses of cmb data made with different statistical tools have provided indications of either consistency or deviation from gaussianity ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . in a recent paper@xcite",
    "we have proposed two new large - angle non - gaussianity indicators , based on skewness and kurtosis of large - angle patches of cmb maps , which provide measures of the departure from gaussianity on large angular scales .",
    "we have used these indicators to carry out analyses of large - angle deviation from gaussianity in both band and foreground - reduced wmap cmb maps with and without a _ kq75 _",
    "mask.@xcite we found that while non - gaussianity of the q , v , and w masked maps are consistent with gaussianity , there is a strong indication of deviation from gaussianity in the k and ka masked maps .",
    "we have also shown that the full - sky five - year foreground - reduced internal linear combination ( ilc)@xcite as well as the harmonic ilc ( hilc )  @xcite and the needlet ilc ( nilc)@xcite maps present a significant deviation from gaussianity.@xcite    simulated cmb maps endowed with assigned primordial non - gaussianity are essential tools to test the power and sensitivity of non - gaussian indicators .",
    "the first reported simulations of cmb temperature maps with primordial non - gaussianity introduced through a non - gaussian parameter @xmath1 were given by the wmap team.@xcite subsequently , liguori et al . produced generalized algorithm that improves the computational speed and accuracy,@xcite and includes polarization.@xcite a set of @xmath2 temperature and polarization maps with non - gaussianities of the local type at the wmap angular resolution were then produced.@xcite more recently , elsner and wandelt@xcite presented new algorithm and generated @xmath3 high - angular resolution simulated non - gaussian cmb temperature and polarization maps with non - gaussianities of the local type , for which the level of non - gaussianity is defined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath4 .    in this paper , we extend and complement the investigations of refs . and ( see also the related ref .  ) , by using their skewness and kurtosis indicators to carry out analyses of gaussianity of high - angular resolution simulated non - gaussian cmb temperature maps , equipped with non - gaussianity of local type with different amplitude parameters @xmath4 , and generated according to the procedure given by elsner and wandelt@xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ indicators ] we introduce our non - gaussianity indicators .",
    "section  [ analyses ] contains the results of applying our statistical indicators to the non - gaussian simulated maps and our main conclusions .",
    "the steps of a constructive way of defining our non - gaussianity indicators @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the associated maps ( discrete functions defined on @xmath7 ) from input cmb ( simulated or real data ) maps are the following:@xcite .",
    "take a discrete finite set of points @xmath8 homogeneously distributed on the cmb celestial sphere @xmath7 as the centers of spherical caps of a given aperture @xmath9 ; and calculate for each cap @xmath10 the skewness and kurtosis given , respectively , by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of pixels in the @xmath13 cap , @xmath14 is the temperature at the @xmath15 pixel , @xmath16 is the cmb mean temperature of the @xmath13 cap , and @xmath17 is the standard deviation .",
    "clearly , the whole set of numbers @xmath18 and @xmath19 for each @xmath10 , obtained through this discrete scanning of the cmb sphere , can be viewed as a measure of non - gaussianity in the direction of the center of the cap centered at @xmath20 with aperture @xmath9 .",
    "patching together the @xmath18 and @xmath19 values for all spherical cap @xmath10 , give discrete functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 defined over the celestial sphere , which can be used to measure the deviation from gaussianity as a function of the angular coordinates @xmath23 .",
    "the mollweide projection of skewness and kurtosis functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are nothing but skewness and kurtosis maps , hereafter referred to as @xmath24map and @xmath25map , respectively .",
    "clearly , the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are functions defined on @xmath7 and can be expanded into their spherical harmonics to have their power spectra @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "thus , for example , for the kurtosis indicator @xmath22 one has @xmath28 and can calculate the corresponding angular power spectrum @xmath29 which can be used to quantify the amplitude ( level ) and angular scale of the deviation from gaussianity .",
    "the power spectrum can also be used to calculate the statistical significance of such deviation by comparison with the corresponding power spectrum calculated from input gaussian maps ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "obviously , similar expressions and analyses of the statistical significance can be made for the skewness @xmath21 .    in the next section",
    "we shall use the statistical indicators @xmath21 and @xmath22 to make analyses of non - gaussianity of the high - angular resolution simulated cmb temperature maps endowed with non - gaussianities of the local type , for which the level of non - gaussianity is characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath0 .",
    "from the previous section it is clear that in order to calculate the skewness and kurtosis functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the associated @xmath5 and @xmath6 maps , one ought to have an input cmb map .",
    "the input maps used in our analyses are high - angular resolution simulated cmb temperature maps endowed with non - gaussianities of the local type defined by different values of the dimensionless amplitude parameter @xmath31 .",
    "a simulated map with a desired level of non - gaussianity @xmath4 is such that the spherical harmonic coefficients are given by@xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the linear and non - linear spherical harmonic coefficients of the simulated cmb non - gaussian maps generated in ref .   and are available for download .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows examples of such simulated input cmb maps .",
    "the left panel gives a gaussian map @xmath35 , while the right panel shows a non - gaussian maps with @xmath36 .",
    "the healpix resolution parameter for map of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , as well as in all the high resolution simulated input cmb maps used in this paper , is @xmath37 , which corresponds to @xmath38 pixels .",
    "a maximum multipole moment @xmath39 was also taken .    in the following",
    "we report the results of our analyses made by using @xmath3 simulated as input cmb temperature maps endowed with non - gaussianities of the local type with amplitude parameter @xmath40 .    in our calculations of skewness and kurtosis indicator maps ( @xmath24map and @xmath25map ) , to minimize the statistical noise we have scanned the celestial sphere with spherical caps of aperture @xmath41 , centered at @xmath42 points on the two - sphere homogeneously generated by using healpix package.@xcite         as an illustration of typical skewness and kurtosis maps , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the mollweide projection of @xmath5 ( left ) and @xmath6 ( right ) maps generated from an input cmb simulated map for @xmath43 .",
    "these maps show spots with higher and lower values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which suggest _ large - angle _ dominant components ( low @xmath46 ) in these maps .",
    "we have also calculated similar maps from the simulated input maps endowed with non - gaussianity of local type for the other values of @xmath4 that we are concerned with in this paper . however , since these maps provide only _ qualitative _ information , to avoid repetition we only depict the pair of maps of figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] merely for illustrative purpose .    in order to obtain",
    "_ quantitative _ large - angle - scale information of the non - gaussianity of @xmath47 calculated @xmath5 and @xmath6 maps ( obtained from @xmath48 simulated input cmb maps generated for @xmath49 ) , we have calculated the low @xmath46 ( @xmath50 ) averaged power spectra @xmath26 and @xmath27 , obtained by averaging over @xmath3 power spectra of @xmath5 and @xmath6 maps , calculated for each value of @xmath4 .",
    "the statistical significance of these power spectra is estimated by comparing the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 obtained from input maps generated for @xmath51 with the values of the corresponding power spectra @xmath26 and @xmath27 obtained from the gaussian ( @xmath52 ) input simulated map .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the average power spectra of the skewness @xmath26 ( left panel ) and kurtosis @xmath27 ( right panel ) , for @xmath50 , calculated from input simulated gaussian ( @xmath52 ) maps , and from cmb maps equipped with non - gaussianity of the local type for which @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath54 confidence level , obtained from the @xmath5 and @xmath6 maps calculated from the gaussian cmb simulated maps , is indicated in this figure by the dashed line . and",
    "@xmath6 maps and associated power spectra we refer the readers to refs .   and .",
    "] to the extent that the average @xmath26 and @xmath27 obtained from input simulated cmb maps endowed with @xmath55 are within @xmath54 monte - carlo ( mc ) average values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath52 , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that our indicators are not suitable to detect this small level of primordial non - gaussianity of local type in cmb maps .",
    "however , this figure also shows that they can be effectively employed to detect higher level of non - gaussianity of local type .",
    "these results square with the refined numerical analysis we shall report in the remainder of this paper .    to have an overall assessment power spectra @xmath56 and @xmath57 , calculated from the input simulated non - gaussian maps equipped primordial non - gaussianity of local type",
    ", we have performed a @xmath58 test to find out the goodness of fit for @xmath26 and @xmath27 multipole values as compared to the expected multipole values obtained from @xmath5 and @xmath6 maps calculated from monte - carlo ( mc ) statistically gaussian ( @xmath52 ) simulated cmb maps . in each case , this gives a number that quantifies collectively the deviation from gaussianity .",
    "for the power spectra @xmath56 and @xmath57 we found the values given in table  [ table1 ] for the ratio @xmath59 ( dof stands for degrees of freedom ) for the power spectra calculated from non - gaussianity of local type with @xmath53 .    clearly , the greater are the values for @xmath59 the smaller are the @xmath58 probabilities , that is the probability that the values of power spectra @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the expected values of the power spectra of the gaussian maps agree .",
    "thus , from table  [ table1 ] one concludes that the maps endowed with @xmath55 present very small level of primordial non - gaussianity , as detected by our indicators , while the non - gaussinity of the maps with @xmath60 are a few orders of magnitude higher and suitably detected by both indicators @xmath5 and @xmath6 , in particular by the kurtosis indicator @xmath6 .",
