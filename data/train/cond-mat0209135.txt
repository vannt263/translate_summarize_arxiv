    "these results nicely demonstrate the difference between the convergence of the stochastic process for the field amplitude @xmath35 and for the many - body ansatz .",
    "since the deterministic term ( [ eq : b1 ] ) is norm - conserving and the noise term ( [ eq : b2 ] ) does not grow faster than @xmath168 , one can apply a regularity theorem which guarantees that no finite time divergences can occur in the random dynamics of the field amplitude @xmath35 and that all the moments of the stochastic wave function are finite ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) . however , the statistical uncertainty is still divergent because the bargmann ansatz involves an exponential function of the field amplitude @xmath31 and not only a polynomial one as was the case with fock states  @xcite .      in the previous subsection we showed that the statistical uncertainty for a simulation performed according to the bargmann scheme is infinite . in",
