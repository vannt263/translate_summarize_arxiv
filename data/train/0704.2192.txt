    "accreting x - ray pulsars were discovered in the late 1960s by rocket flights from white sands in new mexico @xcite . since that time",
    "the number of known x - ray pulsars of all types has grown to over 100 .",
    "the prevailing model for accreting x - ray pulsars consists of a neutron star orbiting a normal stellar companion that is losing matter via either roche lobe overflow or a stellar wind .",
    "accreting x - ray pulsar spectra are characterized by a power - law dependence on energy in the range above @xmath0 kev with a quasi - exponential cutoff at higher energies , typically near 20 - 40  kev .",
    "for example , see the x - ray spectrum of 4u11626 - 67 reported by @xcite , or the multiple source spectra reported by @xcite .",
    "cyclotron features have also been observed in many sources @xcite .",
    "comptonization is known to play an important role in the x - ray pulsar spectral formation process .",
    "this is a general result , based on the overall spectral shape ( a power - law ) and the fact that comptonization tends to result in a power - law dependence with energy in many accreting compact object sources .",
    "the usual method of characterizing accreting x - ray pulsar spectra is to fit the broad - band x - ray spectra using a number of ad - hoc functions such as power - laws , gaussian emission line features , gaussian or lorentzian absorption features , and various types of quasi - exponential high - energy cutoffs .",
    "however , most of these functional forms have little physical motivation beyond the fact that they `` look like the spectra '' and they are easy to incorporate into spectral fitting programs ( e.g. , xspec ) . the real physical parameters of the source ( e.g. , accretion rate , accretion region size , shock height , plasma temperature , etc .",
    ") are not directly connected with the ad hoc parameters and are in fact much harder to determine .",
    "three principal models have been put forward to explain the energy spectra of accreting x - ray pulsars : the gas - mediated collisionless shock model @xcite ; the coulomb collisional stopping model @xcite ; and the radiation - dominated flow model @xcite . the collisionless shock model and the coulomb collisional model",
    "can only be applied in the case of low - luminosity accretion onto neutron stars . in such models ,",
    "the effects of radiation pressure are assumed to be small , and the flow impinges directly onto the neutron star surface ( in the absence of other effects ; see below ) .",
    "these models tend to produce pencil - beamed emission patterns because the radiation escapes primarily through the top of the neutron star atmosphere . in high - luminosity pulsars ,",
    "the dynamical structure is expected to be dominated by the effects of radiation pressure , which decelerates the gas to rest at the stellar surface .",
    "the radiation - dominated inflow models of @xcite and @xcite attempt to describe the flow dynamics across a broad range of x - ray pulsar luminosities , all the way up to the eddington limit .    neither the collisionless shock model nor the coulomb collisional model have demonstrated good agreement with actual x - ray pulsar spectra . @xcite compared the spectrum of her  x-1  with results obtained using the coulomb collisional model . the observed her  x-1  spectrum was not well fit by the calculated spectra .",
    "furthermore , the applicability of the coulomb collisional model to her  x-1  is questionable because the source luminosity is believed to be close to the eddington limit ( @xmath1  at 5 kpc ) , implying that radiation pressure is important @xcite . for further discussion of coulomb collisional stopping models",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "insight into the photon transport in the accretion column can be gained by estimating the optical depth to electron scattering in the magnetic field direction , @xmath2 , and the scattering optical depth across the accretion column , @xmath3 .",
    "assuming thomson scattering and a free - fall velocity profile , we can express these quantities in cgs units using ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the accretion luminosity , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the neutron star mass and radius , respectively , and @xmath9 is the radius of the accretion region on the neutron star surface . based on the modeling described below , we find that @xmath10 and @xmath11 for .",
    "conversely , in the her  x-1  case we obtain @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "hence photons will scatter many more times while escaping from the accretion flow in her  x-1  than in .",
    "this is a general result that applies to all high - luminosity x - ray pulsars such as her  x-1  because of the larger accretion rates compared with the low - luminosity , steep spectrum sources such as .",

    "we define a source function @xmath32 such that @xmath33 gives the number of seed photons injected per unit time in the altitude range @xmath16 to @xmath34 and energy range @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
