    "in the present article , we first point out that we can regard the rashba spin - orbit interaction and the dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction in two - dimensional semiconductor heterojunctions as a non - abelian gauge field , or the yang - mills field  @xcite .",
    "the yang - mills field generates a physical field due to which the wave function acquires a spin - dependent phase factor .",
    "this phase is called the aharonov - casher phase  @xcite in the context of semiconductor physics and often discussed in connection to the berry phase  @xcite .",
    "we show that the aharonov - bohm phase and the aharonov - casher phase are straightforwardly understood in terms of the standard non - abelian gauge field theory in a unified way .",
    "we next show that , applying the non - abelian gauge field together with the usual vector potential on an mesoscopic interference circuit , we can construct a perfect spin filter from which only one component of the spin comes out .",
    "there have been indeed similar proposals  @xcite ; the essential difference here is the explicit specification of the tilt of the spin quantization axis .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction  @xcite in the two - dimensional electron gas attracts much attention recently , particularly because of possibilities of manipulating the spin under an electric field .",
    "there have been many numerical calculations of the conductance in a quantum ring with the rashba spin - orbit interaction  @xcite . however , it is our observation that there are not many guiding principles of designing nanostructures for particular purposes .",
    "we here give a simple way of analyzing the effect of the spin - orbit interaction on the electron wave function , thereby providing a general guiding principle of designing a nano - scale interference circuit .",
    "the hamiltonian with the rashba spin - orbit interaction is given by  @xcite @xmath0 and the hamiltonian with the dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the effective mass of the electron and @xmath3 is the coupling constant of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "let us , for the moment , describe our theory in the case of the rashba interaction ; the discussion is completely parallel for the dresselhaus interaction .",
    "the key to the analysis below is to transform the hamiltonian  ( [ eq010 ] ) in the form @xmath4 & & \\nonumber\\\\ + \\mathrm{const.},&&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 we could regard @xmath6 as a charge and the terms @xmath7 as the corresponding vector potential , but the essential difference is that the components of the `` vector potential '' do not commute with each other .",
    "thus we have a non - abelian gauge field .",
    "a simple way of finding a consequence of the non - abelian gauge field is given as follows .",
    "consider the paths i and ii on an infinitesimal @xmath8 square as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the gauge fields are constant but non - commutative , which generates a phase difference between the two paths . ]",
    "the phase factor which the electron taking the path i acquires is given by @xmath9/8},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the phase factor on the path ii is given by @xmath10/8},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the lowest - order baker - campbell - hausdorff formula for infinitesimal @xmath11 .",
    "thus the phase difference between the paths , or equivalently the phase factor which the electron acquires upon circling the infinitesimal square is @xmath12/4 } = e^{i\\theta^2 l^2 \\sigma_z/2}.\\ ] ] this phase factor is caused by the non - commutativity of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . interpreting that a flux @xmath15 of a physical field generates the phase factor  ( [ eq100 ] ) in the form @xmath16 we find that the physical field @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 for infinitesimal @xmath11 .",
    "we thus realize that the non - abelian gauge field actually generates a physical field .",
    "note here that the physical field is spin - dependent .",
    "the above argument holds quantitatively only for the lowest order in @xmath11 ; the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula gives in eq .",
    "( [ eq80 ] ) and  ( [ eq90 ] ) higher order terms containing @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this fact is important in realizing a perfect spin filter in sec .",
    "iii below .",
    "let us now generalize the above argument to the case where we have both a spin - orbit interaction and a vector potential .",
    "the hamiltonian with the vector potential and the rashba interaction is given by  @xcite @xmath19 + \\mathrm{const .",
    "} , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the generalized momentum operator with the vector potential @xmath21 .",
    "let us compare the hamiltonian  ( [ eq11 ] ) with the yang - mills hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the coupling constant and each of the gauge field components @xmath24 is actually a @xmath25 hermitian matrix .",
    "we can make the identification @xmath26 we here set @xmath27 for later convenience .",
    "the standard gauge field theory asserts that the physical field generated by the gauge field @xmath28 is  @xcite @xmath29 \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq50 } & = & \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_\\mu}\\tilde{a}_\\nu-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_\\nu}\\tilde{a}_\\mu\\right ) -i\\frac{\\tilde{e}}{\\hbar}\\left[\\tilde{a}_\\mu,\\tilde{a}_\\nu\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the covariant derivative defined by @xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the first term of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq50 ] ) is the contribution due to the rotation of the gauge field , while the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq50 ] ) is the contribution due to the non - abelian nature of the yang - mills field .    applying the formula  ( [ eq50 ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq41 ] ) , we find the physical field to be @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the usual magnetic flux penetrating the area @xmath37 , while @xmath15 is the flux of the physical field given by eq .",
    "( [ eq115 ] ) .",
    "a parallel discussion shows that the dresselhaus interaction gives the physical field @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the flux of the physical field generated by the dresselhaus interaction .    in both eqs .",
    "( [ eq70 ] ) and  ( [ eq75 ] ) , the first term on the right - hand side is the usual magnetic field coming from a rotating vector potential , which causes the aharonov - bohm phase , and @xmath40 is the electron charge .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side is the physical field generated by the non - commutativity of the yang - mills field , which causes the aharonov - casher phase , and @xmath6 plays the role of the charge for the spin - orbit interaction . the two phases are often explained in the following context ; a charged particle circulating a magnetic flux acquires the aharonov - bohm phase , whereas a magnetic moment circulating an electric flux acquires the aharonov - casher phase .",
    "we emphasize that the standard non - abelian gauge field theory explains the phases straightforwardly in the unified way shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq70 ] ) and  ( [ eq75 ] ) .",
    "it is our opinion that the explanation here is more general than the prevailing explanation of the aharonov - casher phase as a phase of a spin circulating an electric flux .",
    "the rashba coupling @xmath3 is indeed proportional to the external electric field , but the dresselhaus interaction is induced by a crystal field , not an external electric field .",
    "we also note that the physical fields in eqs .",
    "( [ eq70 ] ) and  ( [ eq75 ] ) have no cross terms between the vector potential and the spin - orbit interaction ; the position - dependent abelian part of the gauge field ( the vector potential ) solely gives the aharonov - bohm phase , while the position - independent non - abelian part of the gauge field ( the spin - orbit interaction ) solely gives the aharonov - casher phase .",
    "a position - dependent spin - orbit interaction would result in two modifications of the above theory .",
    "first , the constant term of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) would be a static potential instead .",
    "second , the first term of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq50 ] ) would include a contribution from the spin - orbit interaction , and hence the second term of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq70 ] ) would be position - dependent .",
    "the first modification , in particular , would result in changes of the energy dependence of the conductance below and hence might hinder the realization of the perfect spin filter discussed in sec .",
    "we again concentrate on the rashba spin - orbit interaction hereafter . we stress that the second term of the physical field  ( [ eq70 ] ) is spin - dependent .",
    "when an up - spin electron feels a positive field , the down - spin electron feels a negative field of the same magnitude .",
    "in contrast , the usual vector potential that generates the usual magnetic field ( the first term of the physical field  ( [ eq70 ] ) ) is spin - independent ; it creates a phase factor of the same sign for both up spins and down spins .",
    "now let us adjust the parameters so that , when electrons circle an interference circuit , the spin - orbit interaction may create the phase @xmath41 for up and down spins , respectively , _ and _ the usual vector potential may create the additional phase @xmath42 for both spins .",
    "then the up - spin electrons acquire the phase factor @xmath43 while the down - spin electrons acquire the phase factor @xmath44 ; the interference is completely destructive for the up - spin electrons and completely constructive for the down - spin electrons .",
    "the up - spin electrons would not come out of such an interference circuit .",
    "this constitutes a perfect spin filter .    in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate that the above idea is indeed realized in two systems with a slight modification .",
    "a difference of the reality from the above naive argument is due to the fact that eq .",
    "( [ eq100 ] ) holds only in the lowest order of infinitesimal @xmath11 . as mentioned at the end of sec .",
    "iia , other terms proportional to @xmath13 and @xmath14 appear in the phase for a circuit of finite size .",
    "therefore , the perfect spin filter is realized only for a tilted quantization axis which diagonalizes the phase factor @xmath45 .",
    "the idea of the perfect spin filter was presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , but both works , employing perturbation theory , did not elaborate the idea to the extent of tilting the spin quantization axis .",
    "the tilt of the spin quantization axis was taken in ref .",
    "@xcite to analyze a spin switch .      as a first example",
    ", we consider a tight binding model on a lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .     and to the right of the point @xmath46 .",
    "]    the four edges on the central square are subject to the rashba spin - orbit interaction , while the left lead ( @xmath47 ) and the right lead ( @xmath48 ) are free of the rashba interaction .",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath49 penetrating the square can be described by the vector potential @xmath50 assuming that the magnetic field is contained inside the square and not applied on the paths themselves , we neglect the zeeman term here .",
    "we use the standard definition of the tight - binding model with the rashba interaction  @xcite for the square .",
    "the hopping from @xmath51 to @xmath52 generates the phase factor @xmath53 .",
    "hence we have the hopping term @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the creation and annihilation operators that have two components : @xmath58 the hopping from @xmath51 to @xmath59 is described by the term @xmath60 the hopping from @xmath59 to @xmath46 has , in addition to the above hopping elements , a phase due to the vector potential  ( [ eq120 ] ) of the form @xmath61 and the hopping from @xmath52 to @xmath46 has the additional phase @xmath62 .",
    "the leads attached to the points @xmath51 and @xmath46 , on the other hand , are given by the simple tight - binding model : @xmath63    the above definitions of the hopping elements give the phase factor that the spin - up and spin - down electrons at @xmath51 , @xmath64 acquire upon circling the square , in the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the magnetic flux and @xmath68 the flux unit .",

    "we note that the spin quantization axis of these bases is considerably tilted .",

    "thus we realized a perfect spin filter .",
    "the geometric symmetry between the lower and upper arms of the interference circuit in fig .  [ fig2 ] does not seem to play an apparent role in the above argument .",
