    "in the coming years , the major effort in high  energy physics will be the search for a higgs boson or an alternative to such a fundamental higgs scalar at the lhc . however , fundamental scalars are difficult to accommodate in field theory  their masses are quadratically divergent with the cutoff scale of the theory .",
    "this problem naturally leads to speculations about the necessary ultraviolet completion of the standard model , which should remove such quadratic divergences and allow to extrapolate our understanding to maybe even the planck scale .",
    "such an ultraviolet completion can ( and should ) at the same time solve the second big mystery of high  energy physics , the existence of cold dark matter .    an overwhelming amount of data on possible ultraviolet completions of the standard model has been amassed over the past decades , consistently confirming the standard model .",
    "lep and tevatron have put stringent bounds on the masses of new particles , cutting into the preferred region for example for supersymmetric dark matter  @xcite not only via the derived light higgs mass , but also via direct searches  @xcite .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon may or may not seriously threaten the standard model , but it will certainly disfavor many possible interpretations of lhc signatures  @xcite .",
    "flavor physics lead to the postulation of additional symmetries in ultraviolet completions , an example being supersymmetry  @xcite . and",
    "last but not least , the measured relic density of the dark matter agent puts very stringent constraints not only on the mass and coupling of such a candidate , but also on other particles involved in the annihilation process or in its ( direct or indirect ) detection  @xcite .",
    "physics scenarios do not simply predict a new narrow resonance , such as for example a @xmath0 . instead , a wealth of measurements at the lhc , and later on at the ilc and other experiments might be available , and with it the need to be combined properly .",
    "the situation could be similar to current fits of electroweak precision data , but most likely it will be much more complex .",
    "the lhc era with all its experiments can give a great many hints about new ",
    "physics scenarios , it will certainly rule out large classes of extensions of the standard model  but it will definitely not give a one  to  one map between a limited number of observables and a well  defined small set of model parameters .",
    "bayesian probability distributions and frequentist profile likelihoods are two ways to study an imperfectly measured parameter space , where some model parameters might be very well determined , others heavily correlated , and even others basically unconstrained .",
    "this situation is different for example from @xmath1 physics , where theoretical degeneracies and symmetries have become a major challenge  @xcite .",
    "a careful comparison of the benefits and traps of the frequentist and the bayesian approaches in the light of new  physics searches is therefore necessary .",
    "sfitter follows both paths .",
    "if heavy strongly interacting particles can be produced at the lhc , they will decay into lighter weakly interacting particles and finally into the dark matter candidate  @xcite , with decay cascades longer than the top  quark decay chain .",
    "these cascade measurements not only carry information on the masses of the particles involved .",
    "the angular correlations also reflect the spins of the particles in the cascade and allow tests for example of the susy hypothesis against an extra  dimensional hypothesis  @xcite . at the ilc ,",
    "detailed analyses of kinematically accessible particles will be possible , for example using threshold scans  @xcite .",
    "masses , branching ratios as well as measurements of particle spins will shed additional light on the underlying theory .",
    "currently , no attempt is made to measure discrete quantum numbers of new  physics particles using sfitter .",
    "instead the analysis is limited to the continuous space of the parameters .    in this paper",
    "the analysis will be restricted to the parameter point sps1a",
    "@xcite , only because it has been studied in detail by the experimental communities at the lhc and ilc .",
    "after briefly reviewing the experimental results and the treatment of the experimental and theoretical errors in sfitter , the relevant features of these measurements as well as the approach of sfitter  @xcite will be illustrated in the msugra model , before moving on to the weak  scale mssm .",
    "the organization of the msugra and the mssm sections follows the general logic of sfitter : first , a fully exclusive log - likelihood map of the respective parameter space is constructed and a ranked list of the best ",
    "fitting points is produced .",
    "we will see that already for the msugra parameter space the lhc measurements will lead to strong correlations and alternative likelihood maxima .",
    "the situation will become more complex in the case of the mssm , where equally good alternative best ",
    "fitting points are induced by the structure of the gaugino  higgsino mass parameters , the sign of the higgsino mass parameter , and the correlations between the trilinear coupling in the top sector and the top  quark mass .",
    "this degeneracy would have to be broken by additional measurements , at the lhc or elsewhere .    starting from the log - likelihood map we then use frequentist and bayesian constructions to study lower  dimensional probability distributions including correlation effects .",
    "again , this analysis illustrates the complex structure of the mssm parameter space as well as the features of the statistics methods employed .",
    "finally , the weak  scale mssm lagrangian is reconstructed with proper experimental and theory error distributions .",
    "this weak  scale result should serve as a starting point to probe supersymmetry breaking bottom  up without theoretical bias .",
    "in the appendices we discuss the techniques of sfitter using a simple toy model .",
    "the approach of mapping measurements onto a high  dimensional parameter space as well as the sfitter tool are completely general : model parameters as well as measurements are included in the form of model files and can simply be replaced .",
    "sfitter serves as a general tool to map typically up to 20dimensional highly complex parameter spaces onto a large sample of highly correlated measurements of different quality .",
    "the analysis in this paper critically depends on detailed experimental simulations of measurements and errors at the lhc and at the ilc .",
    "therefore the well  understood parameter point sps1a",
    "@xcite is used .",
    "this point has a favorable phenomenology for both lhc and ilc .",
    "the original version sps1a instead of the dark ",
    "matter corrected spa1/sps1a point is used , since cosmological measurements like the relic density are not part of this work  @xcite .",
    "the parameter point sps1a is characterized by moderately heavy squarks and gluinos , which leads to long cascades including the neutralinos and sleptons .",
    "gauginos are lighter than higgsinos , and the mass of the lightest higgs boson is close to the mass limit determined at lep . the summary of particle mass measurements is listed in table  [ tab : mass_errors ] , taken from ref .",
    "the central values are calculated by suspect  @xcite . in general , we see from the table that the lhc has the advantage of a better coverage of the strongly interacting sparticle sector , whereas a somewhat better coverage and precision in particular in the gaugino sector can be obtained with the ilc  @xcite . it should be noted that the quoted lhc mass measurements are obtained from measurements of kinematical endpoints and mass differences  @xcite , using the observables shown in table  [ tab : edges ] .",
    "the systematic error quoted in these measurements is essentially due to the uncertainty in the lepton and jet energy scales , expected to be 0.1% and 1% , respectively , at the lhc .",
    "these energy  scale errors are each taken to be 99% correlated as discussed in ref  @xcite .",
    "precision mass measurements at the lhc are not possible from the measurement of production rates of certain final states ,",
    "_ i.e. _ combinations of ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the reason are the sizeable qcd uncertainties on the cross section  @xcite , often largely due to gluon radiation from the initial state , but by no means restricted to this one aspect of higher  order corrections .",
    "generic errors on the cross section alone of at least @xmath3 , plus errors due to detector efficiencies and coverage imply that one would only rely on ( @xmath4)type information in the absence of other useful measurements  @xcite . for such cases , the next ",
    "to - leading order production rates for strongly interacting sparticles ( based on prospino2  @xcite ) are implemented in sfitter and can be readily included in the analysis .",
    "the same is true for the branching ratios , where interfaces to msmlib  @xcite and sdecay / s - hit  @xcite are implemented .",
    "the qcd corrections to measurements of the decay kinematics are known to be under control : additional jet radiation is well described by shower monte carlos  @xcite and will not lead to unexpected qcd effects .",
    "off - shell effects in cascade decays can of course be large once particles become almost mass degenerate  @xcite , but in the standard sps1a cascades these effects are expected to be small .    for the ilc , as a rule of thumb",
    "if particles are light enough to be produced in pairs given the center - of - mass energy of the collider , their mass can be determined with impressive accuracy .",
    "the mass determination is possible either through direct reconstruction or through a measurement of the cross section at production threshold with comparable accuracy but different systematics .",
    "precision measurements of the branching ratios , _",
    "e.g. _ of the higgs boson , are possible .",
    "additionally discrete quantum numbers like the spin of the particles can be determined similarly well .",
    ".errors for the mass determination in sps1a , taken from  @xcite . shown are the nominal parameter values ( from suspect ) , the error for the lhc alone , from the lc alone , and from a combined lhc+lc analysis .",
    "empty boxes indicate that the particle can not , to current knowledge , be observed or is too heavy to be produced .",

    "we use a modified version of minuit  @xcite . for the gradient and diagonal second derivatives ,",
    "we replace the simple three - point formulae in the standard minuit version with ridders method  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm starts with the three - point formulae using a large step size , then iteratively shrinks the step size ( typically by a factor of two ) and computes an estimate using all points calculated so far .",
    "the result of the three - point formula using only the new points is used to estimate the calculation s uncertainty .",
    "the iterations terminate when the desired accuracy is reached or when numerical uncertainties dominate for very small step sizes . in this method , not only all odd  power terms in the taylor expansion of the derivative cancel , but also the leading even ",
    "power terms , in turn improving the accuracy .",
    "in addition , the step size is dynamically adjusted to its optimal value .",
    "a slight complication arises from our box ",
    "shaped theory errors , because the function has a discontinuous second derivative .",
    "the minos error estimate is in principle not affected by this , but this discontinuity breaks ridders algorithm : the higher derivative can now vastly differ between two neighboring points , and the terms listed above do not cancel any longer . to solve this problem",
    ", we replace the likelihood function by its original shape around the discontinuity : suppose the parameter point for which we want to compute the derivatives falls into the central region of eq.([eq : flat_errors ] ) where @xmath9 . for the derivatives we always assume @xmath10 , no matter if the parameter point probed by ridders algorithm falls inside or outside the flat region .",
    "similarly , in case the parameter point we are interested in is on the positive branch of the parabola , for the derivatives we just replace the flat region with the opposite branch of the parabola .",
    "note that this is only a technical trick to improve the estimate of the derivative and that the calculated values of @xmath11 are not used anywhere else .    to reduce the number of dimensions over which we would like to compute a probability distribution we have three options :",
    "first we can simply slice the parameter space in @xmath6 , which is useful to illustrate the behavior of @xmath12 but has no statistical meaning whatsoever .",
    "second , we can compute the profile likelihood described in sec .",
    "[ sec : sugra_likelihood ] , just projecting out dimensions by replacing the reduced  dimensional value of @xmath13 by its maximum in the removed dimensions . and finally , we can marginalize over the dimensions .",
    "note that only marginalization will produce a mathematically well  defined lower  dimensional probability distribution . technically , marginalization means nothing but binning the pdf and collecting its values in a histogram for the two remaining dimensions @xmath14 .    in the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig : toy_model ] we immediately see that the small sphere appears more prominent in the profile likelihood version of @xmath5 while the large sphere dominates the two  dimensional bayesian distribution of @xmath5 .",
    "the same effect we see in the one  dimensional distributions @xmath7 , where in the profile likelihood case one of the cuboids appears prominently , as expected from the list of best values for @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 were a pdf we could conclude that the small sphere contains the most likely parameter points while the large sphere is the most likely physics configuration .",
    "this dominance of the large sphere over the most likely single point in the small sphere is an effect of the marginalization , _",
    "i.e. _ an example for a volume effect .",
    "the question if such volume effects should be considered , if instead the best single point is preferable , or if actually the third  best point should be picked out by a theory bias can not and should not be answered by sfitter as a tool .",
    "instead , sfitter provides all information needed by the user to correctly answer each of these different questions .      for reviews of supersymmetry ,",
