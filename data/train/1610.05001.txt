    "application of electric and magnetic fields has turned out to be extremely helpful for developing a detailed understanding of atoms , as the electronic level structure is modified by characteristic energy shifts and/or lifting multiple state degeneracies .",
    "the latter is associated with the symmetry reduction from the so(3 ) group of all rotations down to u(1 ) for rotations about the field , caused by introduction of the preferential field direction in space .",
    "typically , the separation between atomic levels belonging to different principal quantum numbers @xmath2 is so large that resonances between these states can hardly occur for the field strengths accessible in the laboratory .",
    "this is different for rydberg atoms where the valence electron has been promoted into a level with high @xmath4  @xcite . in this range , for the hydrogen atom the levels of the stark ladder simply cross each other , when they come into resonance by application of an electric field .",
    "by contrast , for many - electron atoms the excited electron experiences close to the nucleus a deviation from the @xmath5-coulomb potential due to the core electrons . the influence of this deviation is often comprised in the quantum defect , by which the rydberg formula for the excited electron binding energy is modified to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the rydberg energy and @xmath8 is the quantum defect for an electron with orbital angular momentum @xmath9 .",
    "accordingly , the states within a particular shell show a splitting in zero field , and when an electric field is applied they may show avoided crossings when they approach each other .",
    "excitons in semiconductors can be described as hydrogen - like complexes for which the crystal environment is captured by introducing effective carrier masses and the dielectric function , resulting in a renormalization of the rydberg energy , @xmath10 . like in atomic physics ,",
    "electric and magnetic fields are essential tools for obtaining information about the details of the energy spectrum , determined also by the material parameters",
    ". however , typically the exciton rydberg energy is quite small , so that the observable states are limited to small principal quantum numbers , for example , @xmath11 in the prototypical direct band gap semiconductor gaas .",
    "moreover , when applying an external field it is challenging to separate the split states in energy because of their proximity , making a state identification complicated .",
    "in addition , exciton ionization occurs already in relatively weak electric fields .    here , cu@xmath0o has a somewhat unique position because of its remarkable crystal quality in combination with a large exciton rydberg energy of about @xmath1290 mev  @xcite .",
    "both features have allowed us to observe exciton states up to @xmath2 = 25 in high resolution laser absorption studies  @xcite .",
    "these states , even in absence of external fields , show a fine structure splitting that is related to the reduction from the continuous symmetry of atoms to the discrete o@xmath13 symmetry of the cubic crystal lattice  @xcite .",
    "the fine structure can be traced to the details of the band structure where band mixing effects lead to considerable deviations from a simple parabolic dispersion mostly for the holes  @xcite . by analogy with atoms",
    ", the resulting exciton level series can be approximately cast into an effective quantum defect model , even though we stress that the origin of the quantum defect is quite different  @xcite .    despite the sizable rydberg energy compared to other semiconductors ,",
    "the splitting between different exciton states with @xmath14 is small enough , that application of feasible electric fields should allow one to bring states with different @xmath2 close to each other or even in resonance , without going to highly excited rydberg states . from the quantum defect analogy",
    "a considerable state mixing and avoided crossings may occur between levels .",
    "naively one may still expect that the absorption spectrum has the rather simple appearance of a stark ladder , as the optical parameters like the dielectric function are scalar quantities for a cubic crystal . here",
    "we present the results of an extensive experimental study of the excitonic absorption spectrum for the states with low principal quantum numbers @xmath2 = 3 , 4 , and 5 in cu@xmath0o crystals in presence of an electric field applied along the light propagation axis .",
    "by contrast to the simple expectations , we observe a rich fine structure of the spectra with intricate dependences on crystal orientation and light polarization .",
    "this is because the electric field reduces the system symmetry further down to at least @xmath15 and thereby shuffles oscillator strength from the dominant @xmath16-excitons with @xmath17 to other angular momentum states , activating dipole - forbidden transitions  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the involvement of quadrupolar transitions leads to a high complexity of the spectra involving multiple lines whose presence in the spectra depends strongly on the polarization of the incident laser light relative to the crystal orientation .",
    "our experimental findings are substantiated by detailed numerical calculations .    for completeness",
    ", we note that the cuprous oxide exciton level spectrum in electric field has been experimentally studied before , see the reviews @xcite .",
    "however , in these studies the fine structure could not be resolved in that much detail , which may be related , for example , to the application of much higher fields in order to observe similar effects .",
    "also a connection to previous microscopic calculations  @xcite could not be established . here",
    "the understanding of the exciton level structure is taken to an unprecedented level by providing studies with high spectral resolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we give the details of the experiment . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the experimental results , while in section  [ sec : theory ] the theoretical model for the excitons in electric field is described .",
    "the comparison between theory and experiment is provided in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "in our absorption studies natural cuprous oxide crystal slabs of different orientations were studied : one sample ( sample 1 with a thickness of 50 @xmath18 m ) was cut and polished such that the [ 001 ] direction is along the crystal normal ; in the other case ( sample 2 with a thickness of 30 @xmath18 m ) the [ 110 ] direction is normal to the surface .",
    "the samples were inserted in the liquid helium insert of an optical cryostat at @xmath19 = 1.3 k.    the optical axis was chosen along the crystal normal .",
    "excitation was done by using a broadband white light source the bandwidth of which was reduced to the wavelength range of interest by a double monochromator .",
    "the polarization of the exciting light was chosen to be linear , so that for propagation of the beam along the [ 001 ] direction in sample  1 , the polarization vector @xmath20 was along [ 100 ] , equivalent to @xmath21[010 ] . for the sample  2 with the light propagating along the [ 110 ] direction ,",
    "the two different independent light polarizations are @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that the @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath24 $ ] axes are not equivalent in the cubic @xmath25 point group , hence , it is not a priori obvious whether the transmission spectra are identical or not for these two polarization configurations .",
    "after transmission through the crystal the light is dispersed by a double monochromator and detected by a si - charge coupled device camera .",
    "the spectral resolution provided is less than 10  @xmath18ev .",
    "as will be explained in further detail below , we were focussing in our experiments on the excitons with principal quantum number from @xmath2=3 to 5 . from previous experiments",
    "@xcite we know that the spectral widths of these features exceed considerably the above spectral resolution .",
    "therefore we decided that the white light absorption is sufficient to study the electric field induced modification of the exciton spectrum .",
    "indeed , up to a principal quantum number of @xmath2 = 7 the spectra for laser and white light excitation coincide . for comparison and in depth studies we have also used a tunable single frequency dye laser with a photo - diode detection system , see sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] for details .    for application of the electric field",
    "@xmath26 a special holder was fabricated , in which the samples were mounted strain - free .",
    "the holder was designed such that the field could be applied along the optical axis ( longitudinal configuration , @xmath27 ) . by contrast , in previous experiments  @xcite , only the transversal configuration with @xmath28 was studied .",
    "the sample holder is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sampleholder ] .",
    "the crystal is mounted freely within a kapton - spacer of 75 @xmath18 m thickness that is placed between quartz plates with transparent electrodes of indium tin oxide ( ito ) evaporated on them .",
    "the thickness of the electrodes was chosen to minimize interference signals in the transmission spectra .",
    "we carefully checked that no measurable leakage current is flowing between the contacts .",
    "we note that for recent fine structure studies of the exciton states this geometry was used to activate the @xmath29- and @xmath30-excitons ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively ) and extrapolate their energies towards zero electric field .",
    "however , in these studies the level splitting by electric field was not assessed  @xcite .",
    "m ( * 3 * ) , sample ( * 4 * ) , free space filled with helium ( * 5 * ) . ]    despite all these efforts , we note that we observe depolarization effects in the optical measurements when applying an electric field .",
    "these effects may arise from charges on the crystal surfaces , charge redistribution among defects or optically injected carriers .",
    "as time resolved measurements have shown , these effects can be minimized by cutting down the laser power to less than @xmath33w and pulsing the electric field .",
    "these tools therefore were consequently applied in our studies . with these low laser powers",
    "the effects of the electric field on the spectra were the same in laser excitation as well as in white light excitation .",
    "in particular , we emphasize that the excitation densities are so low , that the formation of dressed states by simultaneous driving of two closely spaced exciton levels by a laser as demonstrated recently for rydberg excitons , see ref .",
    "@xcite , is not relevant .",
    "nevertheless , we find a difference in the electric field scale in the calculations and the scale in experiment determined as described above .",
    "since the precise influence of these depolarization effects is hard to determine , we have rescaled the fields used in the calculations by a constant ( field - independent ) factor when comparing them with experiment .",
    "the scaling factors are about 3  5 and do not vary systematically with studied sample , exciton principal quantum number etc .",
    "most likely the variation of the scaling factors is related to the depolarization - causing charge distributions , which may vary upon thermal cycling of the crystal , for example .",
    "still , we stress again that the elaborated design of the sample holder and the careful choice of experimental conditions have allowed the observation of field - induced effects at field strengths much smaller than in earlier studies .",
    "we study the exciton states of the yellow exciton series in cuprous oxide , involving the topmost valence band and the lowest conduction band .",
    "these bands are formed mainly from copper orbitals : the conduction band is of @xmath34-type character and the valence band is of @xmath35-type character , both with even parity .",
    "optical transitions in electric - dipole approximation require an orbital angular momentum component change by unity , @xmath36 , which obviously can not be achieved in band - to - band transitions at the @xmath37 point , i.e. , the center of the brillouin zone .",
    "the total angular momentum and resulting symmetry of the exciton are given by the product of electron and hole bloch amplitudes with the envelope function .",
    "hence , in contrast to other semiconductors such as gaas or cdte , the dipole - transitions in cuprous oxide become possible due to a nonzero angular momentum of the envelope , namely by exciting excitons with a @xmath16-type envelope wavefunction  @xcite .    the spin - orbit interaction results in the complex coupling of the envelope and bloch functions angular momenta  @xcite .",
    "hence , one expects the exciton with a certain principal quantum number @xmath2 to consist of a multiplet comprising a large number of states .",
    "the symmetry reduction from so(3 ) to @xmath25 by the cubic crystal environment , as compared to the isotropic model often used to describe excitons from the atom analogy , has been shown to activate higher exciton states with odd parity of the envelope : in a crystal angular momentum is strictly speaking no longer a good quantum number . as a result",
    ", oscillator strength is shuffled from the dominant @xmath16-excitons to the @xmath38- or @xmath39-excitons which therefore become detectable in single photon absorption as demonstrated recently  @xcite .",
    "still , the oscillator strength of these features is comparatively small .",
    "therefore we will use the angular momentum notation for the excitons at zero field , for reasons of simplicity and to facilitate the connection to previous results .",
    "the effect of a static electric field is described by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath40 acting on the exciton envelope functions , where @xmath41 is the coordinate of the relative electron - hole motion .",
    "the electric field has odd parity with respect to the space inversion . as a result",
    ", the electric field lifts the inversion symmetry of the cuprous oxide crystal .",
    "if applied along the high symmetry crystallographic direction @xmath22 $ ] , the symmetry is reduced to the @xmath15 point symmetry group .",
    "this will lead to an additional state mixing , by which the odd envelope @xmath16-excitons are mixed with the even @xmath29- and @xmath30-excitons in lowest order perturbation theory .",
    "similarly , the @xmath38-excitons become mixed with the even envelope @xmath42-excitons ( as well as with @xmath30-excitons ) , provided the principal quantum number permits such high angular momentum states according to the limitation to @xmath43 . as a consequence of this state mixing , by application of the electric field not only a splitting of the lines observed already at zero field occurs , but also multiple additional lines are expected to emerge , resulting in a stark ladder . if applied along the [ 110 ] direction ( as in the sample 2 ) , the symmetry is even further reduced to @xmath44 point symmetry from which we expect a further enhancement of the effects of state mixing .      to test these expectations and to set a reference for the subsequent white light studies , we recorded electric field series of the high energy side of the @xmath2 = 4 and 5 excitons using a tunable single frequency dye laser ( sirah matisse ds ) with a linewidth of about 5  nev @xcite .",
    "the laser emission was stabilized by a noise eater ( tem messtechnik noiseeater ) in front of the sample with a suppression of intensity fluctuations by about a factor @xmath45 .",
    "the transmitted laser light was detected by a photo - diode .",
    "the corresponding spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg - exc ] as water - fall plots . since , in general , the spectra are dominated by the @xmath16-excitons with an intensity at least two orders of magnitude larger than that of any other line ( see also the left hand side of fig .  [ fig : comparison ] , giving the transmission for the excitons from @xmath2 = 5 to 7 )",
    ", we have cut the @xmath16-excitons from the shown energy ranges and present only their high energy flanks for different applied voltages , in order to focus on the weaker lines from excitons with higher angular momenta .",
    "the triplet of @xmath38-excitons activated by the mixing with the @xmath16-excitons due to the spin - orbit interaction and cubic symmetry effects are clearly observable starting from @xmath2=4 onwards .",
    "previous calculations showed that four @xmath38-excitons should have finite oscillator strength , but two of them are almost degenerate  @xcite .",
    "application of the field lifts this degeneracy and leads also to activation of other states . in the @xmath2=4 spectra",
    "we observe two more @xmath38-exciton states appearing whose character we conclude from the emergence in the same energy range as the triplet .",
    "simultaneously one of the original @xmath38-exciton peaks remains prominent , while the other two become faint .",
    "note that the linewidths of the additional exciton resonances are considerably broader than those of the original ones , and are similar to those of the @xmath16-excitons . on the high energy side",
    "also another feature appears which we tentatively attribute to a @xmath30-exciton state , also with quite large linewidth .",

    "the @xmath38-excitons split into @xmath48 lines . for @xmath49",
    "we observe two additional lines besides the @xmath38-states , which are identified as @xmath42-envelope excitons .",
    "note the different scales at the energy axis .",
    "the increase of optical density towards lower energies corresponds to the high energy flanks of the @xmath16-excitons .",
    "]    similar absorption lines with qualitatively the same appearance can be resolved for the multiplet related to the @xmath2 = 5 exciton .",
    "note , however , that as expected from the larger polarizability of this exciton the equivalent splitting patterns appear at considerably smaller fields , roughly reduced by a factor of 2 illustrating strongly superlinear scaling of the polarizability with the principal quantum number  @xcite .",
    "also additional lines appear compared to the @xmath2=4 case . as increase of",
    "the principal quantum number by unity also allows for a larger value of the maximum angular momentum @xmath50 by unity , we attribute these two lines to @xmath42-excitons with angular momentum @xmath9=4 .",
    "note that for @xmath2 = 5 also a broad spectral feature shifting from higher to lower energies with increasing voltage appears on the high energy flank .",
    "we attribute this line to the @xmath29-exciton from the @xmath51 multiplet .",
    "irrespective of these details , the two electric field series confirm the expectations of a complex level splitting pattern which can not be explained within a simplified hydrogen - like model .        to obtain better insight into the fine details of the spectra with all the faint lines and the strong field - induced changes , we have calculated the second derivative over the energy of every recorded spectrum and assembled them in a contour plot .",
    "doing so , the huge differences in intensity between the different features are levelled and an easier comparison becomes possible .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] for the excitons with principal quantum numbers from @xmath49 to @xmath52 for three different cases , sample 1 with [ 001 ] orientation and [ 100 ] light polarization ( left contour plot ) and sample 2 with [ 110 ] orientation , in one case for [ 001 ] polarization ( mid ) and in the other case for @xmath53 $ ] polarization ( right ) , respectively . here",
    "the studied energy range has been on purpose extended also to excitons with @xmath54 , in order to present a systematic phenomenology . for the quantitative comparison with theory",
    "we will later on restrict to @xmath55 to @xmath48 , as for higher principal quantum numbers accurate calculations are challenging due to the huge size of the hilbert space involving multiple states , in particular , because of the vicinity of the states with different @xmath2 and necessity to account for ionization processes , which we did not include in our modeling .    comparing the contour plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] , one finds the somewhat surprising result : in the cubic crystal of cuprous oxide the transmission spectra depend on the light propagation direction and light polarization .",
    "the number of lines vary from panel to panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] and the spectra have the simplest appearance for @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57 $ ] coming closest to the simple expectations of a stark ladder .",
    "it is even more surprising that this particular light propagation direction corresponds to the lowest symmetry direction described by the @xmath44 point group . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectra for the other two configurations from first sight appear rather similar , but deviate considerably from a stark fan .",
    "in addition , we note that within the experimentally achievable fields exciton levels from multiplets of different principal quantum numbers can be brought into resonance , especially for the higher @xmath2 . in the right panel , within the experimental accuracy the levels cross each other , contributing to the rather simple appearance of the contour plot .",
    "this crossing behavior changes for the configurations in the other two contour plots : here , in particular , on the high energy flank of a @xmath16-exciton anticrossings are observed , when the states with given @xmath2 ( moving to higher energies ) come into resonance with the states descending in energy from the exciton with the next higher principal quantum number . as mentioned above ,",
    "the anticrossings are somewhat expected from the reduced symmetry in the crystal , effects of the spin - orbit interaction and the deviation of the coulomb interaction potential in the exciton from a pure @xmath5-form by the presence of the short - range part of the electron - hole interaction .",
    "one also confirms that the field induced splitting between different states within a multiplet with a given @xmath2 becomes visible at the lower fields , the higher the principal quantum number .",
    "in addition , the exciton lines split in more and more states with increasing @xmath2 as higher angular momenta become accessible .",
    "in order to describe the experimental data and explain the dependence of the observed transmission spectra on the light propagation direction and the experimental geometry , in this section we present the model of the exciton stark effect in cu@xmath0o and address the optical selection rules for excitonic transitions in the presence of the electric field .",
    "we consider the effect of the external electric field @xmath26 on the yellow exciton series formed of an electron with @xmath58 symmetry bloch amplitudes and a valence band hole with @xmath59 bloch function .",
    "the complex valence band structure results in the admixture of the @xmath60 valence band to the @xmath59 band in the exciton  @xcite . the admixture yields ( i ) the fine structure splitting of exciton multiplets with a given principle quantum number @xmath2 and ( ii ) the fine structure of states with a given orbital angular momentum @xmath9  @xcite . in accordance with eq .",
    "the main effect of the external electric field is on the exciton envelope functions , hence , the band mixing effects can be included in the hydrogen - like model perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we introduce the basis of the exciton states @xmath61 where @xmath41 is the position - vector of the relative electron - hole motion , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are its polar and azimuthal angles , respectively , @xmath65 are the hydrogen - like radial functions , and @xmath66 are the spherical harmonics  @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath67 is the product of the electron and hole bloch amplitudes with @xmath68 , being the spin components .",
    "the effective exciton hamiltonian in cuprous oxide can be written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 takes into account only the orbital energies , @xmath71 is the spin - orbit coupling hamiltonian , @xmath72 describes the exchange interaction between the electron and the hole and @xmath73 comprises the effects of the cubic ( o@xmath13 point symmetry ) environment . in our calculations ,",
    "the excitonic wavefunction is decomposed over the basis functions  , and the hamiltonian @xmath74 , eq .",
    ", is represented in matrix form .",
    "the diagonalization of this matrix yields the exciton energies and wavefunctions which enable us to calculate the transmission spectra in the electric field .",
    "the orbital hamiltonian is diagonal in the quantum numbers @xmath2 , @xmath9 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 and its non - zero matrix elements read @xmath78 where the diagonal energies @xmath79 can be conveniently parametrized in terms of the exciton rydberg and the quantum defect : @xmath80 the spin - orbit coupling is dominant for the valence band states .",
    "therefore it is sufficient to take into account the interaction of the hole spin and its orbital momentum only . in the spherical approximation the spin - orbit hamiltonian acting in the manifold of the states with",
