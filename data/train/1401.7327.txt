    "new experimental results from the large hadron collider have questioned the existence of new physics relevant to the weak scale .",
    "in particular , the discovery of a neutral scalar with properties very similar to those of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson and a mass @xmath0 gev , has set strong constraints on the spectrum of physics beyond the sm , especially the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .    the friction between the higgs boson discovery and the mssm originates from the fact that the mssm predicts an upper bound on the lightest higgs mass at tree level .",
    "this bound is simply the @xmath1 gauge boson mass , @xmath2 gev .",
    "large quantum corrections are then required in order to achieve a higgs mass in agreement with the experimental measurements .",
    "these corrections require heavy stops or a large trilinear stop term , with somewhat lighter stops .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review of the higgs mass in supersymmetric models .",
    "there are two scenarios beyond the mssm , which allow a higgs mass larger than the @xmath1 mass at tree level :    * @xmath3-term contributions : in this case , the mssm higgs interact with new fields which contribute to the higgs quartic coupling through @xmath3-terms .",
    "there are three such possible sets of fields : * * the singlet , @xmath4 , which couples as @xmath5 .",
    "this scenario is referred to as the nmssm or next - to - minimal supersymmetric sm .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . * * the hyperchargeless triplet , @xmath6 , which also modifes the higgs couplings through the new interaction , @xmath7 . for details see refs .",
    "* two @xmath8 triplets , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , so that the superpotential now contains the new interactions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "not only do these fields contribute to the tree level higgs mass but they also generates neutrino masses through the term @xmath13 .",
    "this is referred to as the type ii seesaw mechanism . for a recent discussion of this scenario see ref .",
    "+ the nmssm and the real triplet scenario only increase the higgs mass when the ratio between the mssm higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath14 , is small . on the other hand ,",
    "the enhancement in the type ii scenario can occur for any value of @xmath15 and provides a connection to neutrino masses .",
    "unfortunately , the introduction of triplets spoils the unification of the sm gauge couplings at high scales , if one assumes the presence of the desert between the weak and unification scales .",
    "* @xmath16-term contributions : the introduction of new gauge symmetries , abelian or non - abelian , relevant for the higgs bosons of the mssm , modify the quartic terms of the higgs fields and can , therefore , increase the lightest higgs boson mass at tree level .",
    "such new symmetries require a new higgs sector , which is used to break the new symmetry at some scale above the weak scale .",
    "this type of mechanism has also been investigated by many experts in the field .",
    "see for example refs .",
    "@xcite for details .    in this letter , a third , new",
    ", possibility is presented for increasing the higgs mass at tree level beyond the z mass .",
    "we introduce a new abelian force which changes the mssm higgs fields interactions , as in the @xmath16-term case , but the mass of the new gauge boson is generated through the stueckelberg mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this modifies the higgs mass at tree level , while keeping all of the beneficial features of the mssm .",
    "we investigate this model in detail , showing the dependence of the higgs mass on the new parameters .",
    "since the stueckelberg mechanism leaves the new abelian symmetry unbroken in the mssm sector , one can use the same abelian symmetry to explain the conservation of r - parity and solve a second major issue present in the mssm .",
    "this is possible when the new gauge symmetry is related to @xmath17 . in this case",
    ", the new symmetry has a dual role : it can increase the higgs mass and allow for the conservation of matter parity .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss the stueckelberg mechanism for a simple abelian extension of the mssm , while in section iii we discuss the higgs and neutral gauge boson spectrum .",
    "finally , we discuss the main features of this scenario and its dark matter possibilities .",
    "the simple extension of the mssm investigated in this article is based on the gauge group @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a new abelian symmetry , relevant for all the mssm fields .",
    "the stueckelberg extension of the mssm has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case where the new symmetry is only relevant for the hidden sector , while a @xmath17 stueckelberg extension was studied in  @xcite .",
    "we proceed by leaving the @xmath20 charges of the mssm particle content completely general , but allow for the @xmath21 term in the superpotential , requiring the @xmath20 charge of @xmath22 to be the opposite of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 while symmetry breaking in the sm gauge group is defined by the higgs mechanism , the mass of the new @xmath19 gauge boson is generated by the stueckelberg mechanism . in this case , the relevant lagrangian for this discussion is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is defined in the usual way , and @xmath28 is the vector superfield associated with the new abelian force . for simplicity , we neglect any possible kinetic mixing between the abelian symmetries .",
    "the kinetic terms for the mssm higgs fields are given by @xmath29 where the @xmath30 and @xmath31 vector superfields are represented by @xmath32 ( @xmath33 being the pauli spin matrices ) and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "since the new gauge boson associated with @xmath19 acquires mass through the stueckelberg mechanism , an extra chiral superfield @xmath35 is needed . in order to set our notation",
    "we define the vector and chiral superfields as @xmath36 the stueckelberg gauge transformations for @xmath37 and @xmath35 are @xmath38 these transformations allow the following terms in the lagrangian @xmath39 notice that in this approach , only one chiral superfield , @xmath35 , is needed to generate mass for the abelian gauge boson .",
    "this can be compared to a typical higgs mechanism , which requires at least two chiral superfields , due to anomaly cancellation , when the chiral superfields have a traditional gauge charge .    neglecting kinetic terms , in component form , eq .",

    "this middle term mixes @xmath46 with the mssm higgs fields once the latter fields acquire a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "the combination of these two terms have important implications for the lightest higgs mass . for more details on the application of the stueckelberg mechanism to abelian extensions of the mssm ,",

    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the application of this mechanism to the conservation of @xmath47-parity when the new symmetry is @xmath48 .",
    "using the above interactions , the scalar potential for the neutral higgs fields is @xmath49 with @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the soft mass of @xmath46 . in our notation ,",

    "such mixing is highly constrained by electroweak precision tests and will , therefore , force @xmath56 .",

    "namely , these terms represent the product of the quartic coupling of the higgs and the higgs vev squared . in the mssm",
    ", this is simply @xmath84 , the @xmath1 mass . in this model",
    "this is extended by @xmath85 times a factor that measures the splitting between the mass of @xmath46 and it s mixing with @xmath86 . when @xmath87 , there is a strong mixing between @xmath86 and @xmath46 that cancels out the positive contribution from the new quartic term . in the opposite limit , when @xmath88 , this mixing effect decouples and one is left with the positive contribution from the new quartic term .",
    "therefore , for a large @xmath63 , the tree - level higgs mass can be increased beyond the @xmath1 mass .",
    "then , the upper bound on the lightest higgs mass in this model is given by @xmath89 this bound is saturated in the decoupling limit , @xmath90 .    in order to numerically appreciate the impact of the stueckelberg mechanism on the higgs mass , fig .",

    "[ fig : mh0 ] , @xmath91 and @xmath92 tev , the higgs mass is increased from about 89 gev to 97 gev , an increase of about @xmath93 .",
    "figures  [ fig : mh2 ] and  [ fig : mh2b ] extend the calculation of the higgs mass to the two - loop level in order to illustrate that the stops can be light even with a negligible trilinear term . here",

    "this connection can be realized when the @xmath19 is a linear combination of weak hypercharge and @xmath17 . in this theory , anomaly cancellation",
    "can be achieved by simply adding three generations of right - handed neutrinos , see _ e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is well - known that this type of symmetry can be obtained from grand unified theories based on the @xmath105 gauge group . in this case",
    "the r - parity violating terms @xmath106 are forbidden by the presence of @xmath17 and therefore r - parity is automatically conserved .",
    "this guarantees the stability of the lightest supersymmetric particle and that it can be a dark matter candidate in the usual way .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for the study of dark matter candidates in models with the stueckelberg mechanism .",
    "such a scenario allows yukawa couplings between the right - handed neutrinos and the sm neutrinos indicating that neutrinos are dirac fermions .",
    "while consistent with the mssm , the recently discovered higgs boson places some tension on the mssm .",
    "this is because the mssm requires heavy stops or a large stop trilinear term , with somewhat lighter stops , to reproduce the experimentally measured higgs mass .",
    "various extensions of the mssm have been proposed to relieve this tension through either new @xmath3-term or @xmath16-term contributions to the tree - level higgs mass . in this letter , we have proposed a new scenario to achieve this goal .",
    "similar to the case of non - decoupling @xmath16-terms associated with a new abelian gauge group , but here , the new gauge boson acquires mass through the stueckelberg mechanism .",
    "because the stueckelberg mechanism allows gauge boson to acquire masses without breaking their associated abelian symmetry , it can explain the origin of r - parity conservation .",
    "this is possible when the new symmetry is related to @xmath17 , because r - parity is a subgroup of @xmath17 .",
    "it this way , the gauge symmetry can play a dual role of both explaining the conservation of r - parity and increasing the higgs mass at tree level .",
    "since this mechanism provides a solid foundation for r - parity conservation , it motivates the study of dark matter in this context .",
    "in particular , the superpartner of the right handed neutrinos can be a good spin zero candidate .",
    "we will investigate the experimental constrains for this scenario in the near future .",
