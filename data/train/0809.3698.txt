    "nowadays , the production of heavy quarkonium states at high energies is under intense theoretical and experimental study @xcite .",
    "the production mechanism involves the physics of both short and long distances , and so , appeals to both perturbative and nonperturbative methods of qcd .",
    "the creation of a heavy quark pair proceeds via the photon - gluon or gluon - gluon fusion ( respectively , in @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions ) referring to small distances of the order of @xmath4 , while the formation of the colorless final state refers to longer distances of the order of @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "these distances are longer than the distances typical for hard interaction but are yet shorter than the ones responsible for hadronization ( or confinement ) .",
    "consequently , the production of heavy quarkonium states is under control of perturbative qcd but , on the other hand , is succeeded by nonperturbative emission of soft gluons .",
    "this feature gives rise to two competing theoretical approaches known in the literature as the color - singlet @xcite and color - octet @xcite models . according to the color - singlet approach",
    ", the formation of a colorless final state takes place already at the level of the hard partonic subprocess ( which includes the emission of hard gluons when necessary ) . in the color - octet model ,",
    "also known as nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , the formation of a meson starts from a color - octet pair and proceeds via the emission of soft nonperturbative gluons .",
    "the former model has a well defined applicability range and has already demonstrated its predictive power in describing the production at hera , both in the collinear @xcite and the @xcite approaches . as it was shown in the analysis of recent zeus @xcite data ,",
    "there is no need in the color - octet contribution , neither in the collinear nor in the approach .",
    "the numerical estimates of co contributions extracted from the analysis of tevatron data are at odds with the hera data , especially as far as the inelasticity parameter @xmath6 is concerned @xcite . in the approach ,",
    "the values of the color - octet contributions obtained as fits of the tevatron data appear to be substantially smaller than the ones in the collinear scheme , or even can be neglected at all @xcite .    in the present note",
    "we want to compare the predictions of @xmath7 factorization approach  @xcite with the d0 experimental data on the @xmath8 distributions  @xcite and the polarizaton of @xmath9 ( 1s ) meson states produced at the tevatron energies  @xcite .",
    "in the approach , the cross section of a physical process is calculated as a convolution of the partonic cross section @xmath10 and the unintegrated parton distribustion @xmath11 , which depend on both the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath12 and transverse momentum @xmath13 : @xmath14 in accord with the prescriptions @xcite , the off - shell gluon spin density matrix is taken in the form @xmath15 in all other respects , our calculations follow the standard feynman rules .    in order to estimate the degree of theoretical uncertainty connected with the choice of unintegrated gluon density , we use two different parametrizations , which are known to show the largest difference with each other , namely , the ones proposed in refs . @xcite and @xcite . in the first case @xcite , the unintegrated gluon density is derived from the ordinary ( collinear ) density @xmath16 by differentiating it with respect to @xmath17 and setting @xmath18 .",
    "here we use the lo grv set @xcite as the input colinear density . in the following , this will be referred to as dgrv parametrisation .",
    "the other unintegrated gluon density @xcite is obtained as a solution of leading order bfkl equation @xcite in the double - logarithm approximation . in the following ,",
    "this will be referred to as jb parametrisation .",
    "the production of mesons in @xmath3 collisions can proceed via either direct gluon - gluon fusion or the production of @xmath19-wave states @xmath20 followed by their radiative decays @xmath21 .",
    "the direct mechanism corresponds to the partonic subprocess @xmath22 which includes the emission of an additional hard gluon in the final state .",
    "the production of @xmath19-wave mesons is given by @xmath23 only .",
    "all essential parameters were taken from our previuos paper  @xcite .",
    "1 shows the comparison of our results for the ( 1s ) meson production with the d0 experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented here are also valid for the @xmath24 state , except the lower total cross section ( by an approximate factor of 1/3 ) because of the correspondingly lower value of the wave function @xmath25 gev@xmath26 .",
    "the state ( 3s ) is producted by the purely direct production mechanism and the prediction on the spin alignment parameter @xmath1 becomes less uncertain .",
    "the polarization state of a vector meson is characterized by the spin alignment parameter @xmath1 which is defined as a function of any kinematic variable as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the reaction cross section and @xmath29 is the part of cross section corresponding to mesons with longitudinal polarization ( zero helicity state ) .",
    "the limiting values @xmath30 and @xmath31 refer to the totally transverse and totally longitudinal polarizations",
    ". we will be interested in the behavior of @xmath1 as a function of the transverse momentum : @xmath32 .",
    "the experimental definition of @xmath1 is based on measuring the angular distributions of the decay leptons @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the polar angle of the final state muon measured in the decaying meson rest frame .",
    "1 ( right panel ) shows the comparison of our results for the ( 1s ) meson polarization with the d0 experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the integration limits over rapidity were adjusted to the experimental acceptances of d0 ( @xmath35 ) at the tevatron . the yellow band in fig .",
    "1 corresponds the nrqcd predictions , where the strong transverse polarization is connected with the gluon fragmentation mechanism .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the rapidity distribution for ( 1s ) production in more wide rigion than the d0 experimental data , and behaviour of the alignment parameter @xmath1 as fuction of rapidity . we see that @xmath1 becomes positive at large @xmath36 .",
    "therefore we propose to measure the double differential cross sections of quarkonium productions .    in summary",
    "we have considered the production of mesons in high energy @xmath3 collisions in the approach and compred the predictions on the spin alignment parameter @xmath37 with new the d0 experimental data .",
    "we point out that the purest probe is provided by the polarization of @xmath24 mesons .",
    "we proposed to measure the double cross section of quarkonium production and the spin aligment parameter in more wide kinematical region on the rapidity also .",
