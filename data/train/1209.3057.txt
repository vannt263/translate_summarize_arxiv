    "<S> we break the symmetry by inducing staggered @xmath63 on the uranium sites and determine the largest possible symmetry group that is compatible with their existence . then by iteration we determine if this starting assumption converges to a non - trivial solution . in principle </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that two cases of induced op of the same ir do lead to two different solutions , but they may of course also converge to the same solution .    </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure is determined with the dft+@xmath6 approximation within the apw+@xmath64 method as implemented in the elk - code @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations were performed in a similar way as earlier described @xcite , and is presented in more details in sm @xcite .    for each possible tmtm component of each ir as given in table [ symm ] we have started a calculation with a large value of the corresponding multipole . </S>",
    "<S> all calculations enforce a staggering wave vector @xmath49 for tensors with rank @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that one solution exists for each tr - labelled ir and these results are collected in table [ calc ] for the case of @xmath66 ev . in order to quantify the importance of different tensor components we have utilized the concept of polarization @xmath67 @xcite , which is a normalization independent quantity that directly measures the importance of the different contributions to the polarization of the density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> it is proportional to the square of the components of the tmtm @xmath63 and all components except @xmath68 add up to a total polarization @xmath69 , see sm @xcite for more details . in the case of tr - even all ir converged to the trivial un - polarized case of @xmath70 with only the rotational invariant tensors , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , being non - zero . </S>",
    "<S> they correspond to expectation values of the @xmath5-occupation and the operator @xmath73 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated large value of @xmath72 leads to an enhancement of the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling , which brings the solution in to a relativistic regime with predominantly @xmath74 occupation . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting op is not actually staggered . when the tr symmetry is broken we find in all cases that components of the triakontadipole @xmath75 dominate . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we find smaller contributions from all tmtm components that are allowed by symmetry as given in table [ symm ] , that is both tr - odd as well as tr - even . </S>",
    "<S> however , only two tmtm have significant polarizations , @xmath72 and @xmath75 for all cases except @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in all these cases </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath72 have similar polarizations as in the tr - even case . </S>",
    "<S> the case of @xmath51 is the most complicated . </S>",
    "<S> here there is a strong competition for the exchange energy between the magnetic dipole moments along @xmath26-axis and the two allowed triakontadipole components . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic dipoles have significant polarization for all three mp variants , spin @xmath76 , orbital @xmath77 , and spin dipolar @xmath78 , while the triakontadipole @xmath79 has a contribution of similar strength but @xmath80 has the largest polarization . </S>",
    "<S> although all initializations lead to the same solution , the convergence is often extremely slow which indicates that there is a flat energy - landscape . </S>",
    "<S> this was observed in the earlier study where we first observed the triakontadipoles in the @xmath51 phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the two dimensional ir @xmath52 we have performed two calculations where the op is oriented along the in - plane symmetry directions ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> both the two solutions are stable although different , indicating a strong anisotropy . as anticipated both cases posses non - vanishing magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> the local magnetic moments are 1.1 and 0.8 @xmath81 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> no polarized solution could be found in the case of tetragonal @xmath52 , i.e.  with the ordering vector @xmath82 .    for the tr - odd case we have also looked for the possibility of superimposed op . </S>",
    "<S> only one new solution was found when allowing for various combinations of superimposed op , but this is one of the ho op candidates that were singled out fulfilling all the experimental constrains . </S>",
    "<S> it is @xmath7 , with the @xmath83 two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the product of these two op interacts with the global magnetic field in the @xmath85-plane and gives rise to a nonzero @xmath53 ir of the magnetic susceptibility @xcite , which explains the in - plane response of the torque experiments @xcite .     </S>",

    "<S> we observe that the fs of the two solutions are radically different , while at finite @xmath6 they become surprisingly similar . hence if we would identify the non - magnetic solution with a @xmath1 op as the ho phase and the magnetic solution @xmath51 as the af phase , we see that the calculated fs are in excellent qualitative accordance with recent shubnikov - de haas measurements  @xcite that observe only minor changes in the phase transition from ho to af phase under pressure . in the calculated case </S>",
    "<S> we can see very large resemblances in topology as well as sizes between the fs of the two solutions at both @xmath99 ev and @xmath66 ev . </S>",
    "<S> since the fs for the two different @xmath6-values do not even have the same topology , the fs geometry is very @xmath6 dependent . </S>",
    "<S> so it is left for a future study to calculate more in detail the @xmath6 variation of the fs and to compare more quantitatively with experiments .    in this study </S>",
    "<S> we have performed a detailed and systematic survey of possible ho op in terms of ordering within the uranium @xmath5-bands . </S>",
    "<S> a picture arises from some common features of tables [ symm ] and [ calc ] . </S>",
    "<S> first we observe there are no indication at all in the calculations for a tr - even ho op . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , it is clear that the af solution at high pressure is the ir @xmath51 where the op in the calculation is a superposition of magnetic vector op and tr - odd rank 5 tmtm components , with the last ones dominating . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , this phase competes with an almost pure tmtm op of the kind @xmath83 which belong to the ir @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these two solutions , @xmath51 and @xmath1 , are among the ones that have the largest polarizations , as shown in table [ calc ] . </S>",
    "<S> the ho phase @xmath1 only allows a few multipolar components with tesseral component @xmath58 , where all except @xmath102 become small . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an optimally hidden op . </S>",
    "<S> it is further found that there exist a solution where this @xmath1 op is superimposed with a smaller @xmath4 triakontadipole op , which would explain the recently observed anisotropic in - plane susceptibility@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> from table [ calcop ] we can directly observe that the various solutions for the different ir all have a large contribution from the rank 5 tmtm op @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in good accordance with our earlier observations that these trikontadipoles play a large role for uru@xmath0si@xmath0 in particular @xcite and for the time reversal symmetry breaking for moderate or strong spin - orbit coupling in general @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is summarized as katts rules . </S>",
    "<S> after completion of this study we became aware of a recent calculational study @xcite which also identify the importance of large rank 5 multipoles in the electronic structure of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 . in those random phase approximation ( rpa ) </S>",
