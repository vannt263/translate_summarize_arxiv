    "insufficient stability monitoring and situational awareness have been identified as critical contributors to recent large power system failures , such as august 14 , 2003 @xcite and sept .  8 , 2011 @xcite .",
    "recent deployment of phasor measurement units ( pmu ) produce large quantities of time - series data , which open tremendous opportunities to improve power system stability monitoring and control .",

    ", this paper draws from research on critical transitions in stochastic dynamical systems .",
    "the statistics of time - series data change notably in most stochastic dynamical systems as they approach critical transitions ; systems are more easily perturbed from equilibrium , and take longer to return after being displaced @xcite , @xcite . collectively , this phenomenon is known as critical slowing down ( csd ) , and is most easily observed by testing for autocorrelation and variance in time - series data . increasing autocorrelation and variance have been shown to indicate proximity to critical transitions in climate models @xcite , ecosystems  @xcite and the human brain @xcite . in prior work by the authors",
    ", csd has been shown to be an early warning sign of critical transition in power systems .",
    "a deep understanding of csd in power systems could lead to new tools for wide area measurement and control .",
    "in many systems with critical transitions , slow - varying continuous parameters cause gradual trends in state variables , which generally move the system closer to , or further from , unstable operating points . simultaneously , random perturbations cause fast changes . as a result ,",
    "such systems have two time scales : fast and slow . in power systems , loads have slow predictable trends , such as load ramps in the morning hours , and fast stochastic ones , such as random load switching .",
    "whereas conventional generators tend to vary slowly , intermittent renewable generation , such as pv on a partly cloudy day , can have fast stochastic changes .",
    "because of this , the mathematical framework of fast - slow systems @xcite and stochastic differential equations @xcite can help to explain phenomena in these systems , such as the manner in which autocorrelation and variance increase with proximity to critical points . in  @xcite , the variance and autocorrelation of state variables for several prototypical fast - slow systems is calculated using the fokker - planck approach and numerical simulations .    estimating the proximity of a power system to a particular critical transition ( e.g. , voltage collapse ) has been the focus of a number of papers in the power systems literature .",
    "references @xcite-@xcite present methods to measure the distance between an operating condition and voltage collapse with respect to slow - moving state variables , such as load .",
    "while these methods provide useful information about system stability , they require accurate network models all of which contain some error .",
    "another approach to estimating the distance to critical transitions is to identify statistical patterns in the response of a system to stochastic forcing , such as fluctuations in load , or production from renewable energy sources . to this end , a growing number of papers study power system stability using stochastic models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "reference @xcite models power systems using stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) and solves the sdes using @xmath0 calculus to develop a measure of voltage security . in @xcite , the euler and milstein methods for numerically solving sdes",
    "are used to assess transient stability in power systems , given fluctuating loads and random faults .",
    "reference @xcite uses the time evolution of the probability density function for state variables in a single machine infinite bus ( smib ) system to show how random load fluctuations affect system stability .",
    "the results above clearly show that power system stability is affected by noise in the system .",
    "however , more work is needed to identify useful statistical trends in high sample - rate measurements from power systems .",
    "results from the literature on csd suggest that the combination of both increased autocorrelation and variance in time - series data are needed in order to gain insight into the proximity to critical transitions from data .",
    "reference increasing autocorrelation and variance for an smib model and the 9-bus test case .",
    "reference @xcite shows that voltage variance at the end of a distribution feeder increases as it approaches voltage collapse .",
    "however , these results do not provide insight into autocorrelation . to our knowledge , only @xcite derives an approximate analytical autocorrelation function ( from which either autocorrelation or variance can be found ) for state variables in a power system model .",
    "however , the autocorrelation function in @xcite is limited to the operating regime very close to the threshold of instability . in this paper",
    ", we derive exact autocorrelation functions for the state variables of an smib system .",

    "the stratonovich interpretation also facilitates the use of ordinary calculus , which is not possible under the @xmath0 interpretation .    in this paper",

    "<S> critical slowing down ( csd ) is the phenomenon in which a system recovers more slowly from small perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> csd , as evidenced by increasing signal variance and autocorrelation , has been observed in many dynamical systems approaching a critical transition , and thus can be a useful signal of proximity to transition . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we derive autocorrelation functions for the state variables of a stochastic single machine infinite bus system ( smib ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that both autocorrelation and variance increase as this system approaches a saddle - node bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> the autocorrelation functions help to explain why csd can be used as an indicator of proximity to criticality in power systems revealing , for example , how nonlinearity in the smib system causes these signs to appear . </S>"
