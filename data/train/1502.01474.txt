    "since the `` cold fusion '' publication by fleischmann and pons in 1989 fp1 a new field of experimental physics has emerged .",
    "although even the possibility of the phenomenon of nuclear fusion at low energies is in doubt in mainstream physics , the quest for low - energy nuclear reactions ( lenr ) flourished and hundreds of publications ( mostly experimental ) have been devoted to various aspects of the problem .",
    "( for the summary of experimental observations , the theoretical efforts , and background events see e.g. krivit , @xcite . )",
    "the main reasons for revulsion against the topic according to standard nuclear physics have been : ( a ) due to the coulomb repulsion no nuclear reaction should take place at energies corresponding to room temperature , ( b ) the observed extra heat attributed to nuclear reactions is not accompanied by the nuclear end products expected from hot fusion experiences , ( c ) traces of nuclear transmutations were also observed , that considering the repulsive coulomb interaction is an even more inexplicable fact at these energies .    also in the last two decades , investigating astrophysical factors of nuclear reactions of low atomic numbers , which have great importance in nuclear astrophysics @xcite , @xcite , in the cross section measurements of the @xmath4 reactions in deuterated metal targets extraordinary observations were made in low energy accelerator physics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , czerski 2 , @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of increasing cross sections of the reactions measured in solids compared to the cross sections obtained in gaseous targets is the so called anomalous screening effect .",
    "several years ago a systematical survey of the experimental methods applied in investigating and the theoretical efforts for the explanation of the anomalous screening effect was made @xcite from which one can conclude that the full theoretical explanation of the effect is still open .",
    "motivated by the observations in the above two fields we search for physical phenomena that may have modifying effect on nuclear reactions in solid state environment .",
    "earlier we theoretically found @xcite , @xcite that if the reaction @xmath5 @xmath6 takes place in solid material then the nuclear energy is mostly taken away by an electron of the environment instead of the emission of a @xmath7 photon , a result that calls the attention to the possible role of electrons .",
    "concerning the assistance of the electrons and other charged constituents of the solid , a family of electron assisted nuclear reactions , especially the electron assisted neutron exchange process , furthermore the electron assisted nuclear capture process and the heavy charged particle assisted nuclear processes were discussed mostly in crystalline solid state ( particularly in metal ) environment @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to summarize our theoretical findings and on this basis to explain some experimental observations .",
    "we adopt the approach standard in nuclear physics when describing the cross section of nuclear reactions .",
    "accordingly , heavy , charged particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 of like positive charge of charge numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 need considerable amount of relative kinetic energy @xmath12 determined by the height of the coulomb barrier in order to let the probability of their nuclear interaction have significant value .",
    "the cross section of such a process can be  derived applying the coulomb solution @xmath13 , @xmath14which is the wave function of a free particle of charge number @xmath10 in a repulsive coulomb field of charge number @xmath11 @xcite , in the description of relative motion of projectile and target . in @xmath15 @xmath16 denotes the volume of normalization , @xmath17 is the relative coordinate of the two particles , @xmath18 is the wave number vector in their relative motion and @xmath19 ) , \\label{hyperg}\\]]where @xmath20 is the confluent hypergeometric function and @xmath21 is the gamma function . since @xmath22 ,",
    "the cross section of the process is proportional to @xmath23 -1}=f_{jk}(e ) ,   \\label{fjk}\\]]the so - called coulomb factor .",
    "here @xmath24is the sommerfeld parameter in the case of colliding particles of mass numbers @xmath25 , @xmath26 and rest masses @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 @xmath30 is the atomic energy unit , @xmath31 is the fine structure constant and @xmath12  is taken in the center of mass @xmath32 coordinate system.@xmath33is the reduced mass number of particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 of mass numbers @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus the rate of the nuclear reaction of heavy , charged particles of like positive charge becomes very small at low energies as a consequence of @xmath34 being very small .    in the processes",
    "investigated the coulomb and the strong interactions play crucial role .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath35 comprises the coulomb interaction potential @xmath36 with the charged constituents of surroundings ( solid ) and the interaction potential @xmath37 of the strong interaction : @xmath38(the coulomb interaction between the charged participants of the nuclear reaction is taken into account using @xmath15 . ) therefore the charged particle assisted nuclear reactions are at least second order in terms of standard perturbation calculation . according to @xmath39 , the lowest order of s - matrix element of a charged particle assisted nuclear reaction has two terms which can be visualized with the aid of two graphs . however , the contribution by the term , in which @xmath37 according to chronological order precedes @xmath36 , is negligible because of the smallness of the coulomb factor the root square of which is appearing in the matrix element of @xmath37 in this case .",
    "( in the following we only depicts the graph of the dominant term . )    when describing the effect of the coulomb interaction between the nucleus of charge number @xmath40 and a slow electron one can also use coulomb function , consequently , the cross section of the process to be investigated is proportional to @xmath41 -1 } ,   \\label{fee}\\]]but with @xmath42here @xmath43 is the rest mass of the electron . in the case of low ( less than @xmath44 @xmath45 ) kinetic energy of the electron",
    "@xmath46 reads approximately as @xmath47 .",
    "for instance , the cross section of electron assisted neutron exchange process ( as it will be discussed later , and the graph of which is depicted in fig .",
    "1 ) is proportional to @xmath46 only ( instead of @xmath34 ) since the neutron takes part in strong interaction and so the corresponding matrix element does not contain coulomb factor .",
    "the increment in the cross section due to changing @xmath34 for @xmath46 in the case of electron assisted neutron exchange process can be characterized by the ratio @xmath48 which is an extremely large number .",
    "the cross section of electron assisted neutron exchange process has a further ( about a factor @xmath49 ) increase due to the presence of the lattice since the cross section is also proportional to @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 is the volume of the elementary cell of the solid with @xmath52 the lattice parameter of order of magnitude of @xmath53 @xmath54 .",
    "the extremely huge increment in the coulomb factor increased further by the effect of the lattice makes it possible that the cross section of electron assisted neutron exchange process may reach an observable magnitude even in the very low energy case .",
    "thus it can be concluded that the actual coulomb factors are the clue to the charged particles assisted nuclear reactions and therefore we focus our attention to them especially concerning the coulomb factors of heavy charged particles .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that usual nuclear experiments , in which nuclear reactions of heavy charged particles are investigated , are usually devised taking into account the hindering effect of coulomb repulsion .",
    "consequently , the beam energy is taken to be appropriately high to reach the energy domain where the cross section of the processes becomes appropriately large.therefore in an ordinary nuclear experiment the role of charged particle assisted reactions is not essential .",
    "recognizing the possibility and advantage of the assistance of electrons in lenr we consider first the electron assisted neutron exchange process , namely the    @xmath55    reaction @xcite  ( see fig.1 ) . here",

    "the intermediate neutron ( particle @xmath65 ) is captured due to the strong interaction by the nucleus @xmath68 ( particle @xmath69 ) forming the nucleus @xmath70 ( particle @xmath71 ) in this manner .",
    "all told , in @xmath61 the nucleus @xmath62 ( particle @xmath63 ) looses a neutron which is taken up by the nucleus @xmath68 ( particle @xmath72 ) .",
    "the process is energetically forbidden if @xmath73 .",
    "it was found , as it will be seen later , that the electron takes away negligible energy . in this process",
    "the coulomb factor of electrons arises only since the particle , which is exchanged , is a neutron .",
    "the physical background to the virtual neutron stripping due to the coulomb interaction is worth mentioning .",
    "the attractive coulomb interaction acts between the @xmath74 protons and the electron .",
    "the neutrons do not feel coulomb interaction .",
    "so one can say that in fact the nucleus @xmath66 is stripped of the neutron due to the coulomb attraction .",
    "as an example we take @xmath0 and @xmath1 as target material .",
    "it is thought that the metal ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) is irradiated with slow , free electrons . in this case reaction @xmath61",
    "reads as@xmath75with @xmath76 .",
    "now we demonstrate our calculation .",
    "let us take a solid ( in our case a metal ) which is irradiated by a monoenergetic beam of slow , free electrons .",
    "the corresponding sub - system hamiltonians are @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "it is supposed that their eigenvalue problems are solved , and the complete set of the eigenvectors of the two independent systems are known .",
    "the interaction between them is the coulomb interaction of potential @xmath79 and the other interaction that is taken into account between the nucleons of the solid is the strong interaction potential @xmath80 . in",

    "the reaction energy @xmath58 is shared between the quasi - free final electron and the two final nuclei which take part in the process .",
    "since the aim of this paper is to show the fundamentals of the main effect , the simplest description is chosen .",
    "the electron of charge @xmath82 and the nucleus @xmath83 of charge @xmath84 take part in coulomb - interaction .",

    "<S> the features of electron assisted heavy charged particle exchange processes , electron assisted nuclear capture processes and heavy charged particle assisted nuclear processes are also overviewed . </S>",
    "<S> experimental observations , which may be related to our theoretical findings , are dealt with . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous screening phenomenon is related to electron assisted neutron and proton exchange processes in crystalline solids . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation of observations by fleischmann and pons is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of the phenomenon of nuclear transmutation is qualitatively explained with the aid of usual and charged particle assisted reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the electron assisted neutron exchange processes in pure @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 composite systems ( in the rossi - type e - cat ) are analyzed and it is concluded that the electron assisted neutron exchange reactions in pure @xmath0 and @xmath3 composite systems may be responsible for recent experimental observations . </S>"
