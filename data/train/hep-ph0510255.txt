    "it is well - known that a spin-@xmath12 particle associated with a no self - conjugate field has @xmath13 cp - odd permanent electromagnetic moments . in particular , a charged @xcite or neutral vector particle @xcite has two electromagnetic moments , namely , the electric dipole moment ( edm ) and the magnetic quadrupole moment ( mqm ) .",
    "the scrutiny of these properties may provide relevant information for our knowledge of cp violation , which still remains a mysterious phenomenon whose experimental validity has been well established via some flavor - changing processes such as the mixing of the @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite hadrons .",
    "there is no yet conclusive evidence that the origin of cp violation in @xmath16 mixing is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) phase @xcite , which is the only source of cp violation in the electroweak sector of the standard model ( sm ) , but recent results from @xmath15 factories at slac and kek strongly suggest @xcite that the dominant contribution to @xmath17 mixing arises from such a phase indeed .",
    "this means that , as far as @xmath15 hadron physics is concerned , there is no much room left to detect new sources of cp violation . on the other hand ,",
    "diverse studies @xcite show that the ckm phase has a rather marginal impact on flavor - diagonal processes such as the electric dipole moments of elementary particles , which means that they could be highly sensitive to new sources of cp violation .",
    "in fact , neither the fermions nor the @xmath0 gauge boson can have edms at the one - loop level because a cp - violating phase can not arise at this order since the corresponding amplitudes depend only on the absolute value of the ckm matrix elements .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the edm of both quarks and @xmath0 boson vanishes also at the two - loop level and appears first at the three - loop level @xcite . in the case of charged leptons , without the presence of right - handed neutrinos the edm is still more suppressed and it can only be generated at the four - loop level or higher orders @xcite . however , the existence of new sources of cp violation in this sector is expected due to the recent discovery of neutrinos masses and lepton mixing @xcite . in contrast , as far as the @xmath0 mqm is concerned , it has been shown @xcite that it receives a tiny contribution at the two - loop level in the sm .",
    "apart from the mere theoretical interest , the study of the edm and mqm of the @xmath0 boson is important from the experimental point of view because they can induce large contributions to the edm of the fermions @xcite , such as the electron or the neutron , which may be at the reach of low - energy experiments .",
    "it is thus worth investigating new sources of cp violation beyond the sm .",
    "although these properties of the @xmath0 boson can only be generated through loop effects within renormalizable theories , they may receive large contributions in many sm extensions @xcite .",
    "the only class of models which can generate these quantities at the one - loop level are those involving both left- and right - handed currents with complex phases @xcite . in principle , this one - loop generated effect would contribute dominantly to these @xmath0 properties , but it could be strongly suppressed due to the presence of a tiny complex phase , as occurs in left - right symmetric models(lrsm ) @xcite due to experimental constraints on the @xmath18 mixing . although the presence of at least one fermionic loop involving a dirac trace is required to generate a term proportional to the levi - civita tensor in the @xmath19 vertex , the combination of fermion and scalar fields may supply a potential source of cp violation in flavor - diagonal processes , provided that their interactions involve both scalar and pseudoscalar couplings .",
    "the simultaneous presence of these types of higgs - fermion couplings violate cp invariance , which in turn can induce a trilinear higgs-@xmath0 vertex with similar cp property at the one - loop level .",
    "a @xmath20 vertex including a linear combination of cp - even and cp - odd couplings is enough to generate a cp - odd component in the on - shell vertex @xmath19 , which would correspond to a two - loop effect in a renormalizable theory .",
    "although this source of cp violation is generated at the two - loop level , it could give a contribution to the cp - odd electromagnetic moments of the @xmath0 boson larger than those induced by other alternative sources .",
    "this mechanism does not depend crucially on the existence of a complex phase since it is a direct consequence of the presence of higgs - fermion couplings that violate cp invariance in the fundamental lagrangian , which contrasts with the case of the ckm phase or that arising from left- and right - handed charged currents .",
    "indeed , it is not necessary to go beyond the fermi scale to introduce the most general renormalizable cp - violating @xmath21 vertex .",
    "it arises for instance in the yukawa sector of the type - iii two - higgs doublet model ( thdm ) @xcite , where the @xmath20 vertex is induced at the one - loop level as a linear combination of cp - even and cp - odd couplings , which in turn generate the most general on - shell @xmath19 vertex including both cp - even and cp - odd dynamical structures at the two - loop level .",
    "although there are many types of feynman diagrams contributing to the @xmath0 cp - odd properties in this model @xcite , the contribution from the one - loop @xmath20 vertex generated by the yukawa coupling @xmath22 differs from any other source as it leads to a finite and gauge invariant result by itself @xcite .",
    "the same type of effect can arise from heavy fermions that may be present in several sm extensions , and we will focus on this possibility .",
    "although sm extensions composed by very complex higgs sectors are common , it is worth emphasizing that most of them contain at least one sm - like higgs boson @xmath23 .",
    "such a higgs boson is sm - like in the sense that it is expected to be relatively light , with a mass of order of the fermi scale , and with tree level couplings presenting small deviations from the sm that vanish in some appropriate limit . in this work ,",
    "we are interested in studying this class of deviations , which may lead to the appearance of cp - odd electromagnetic properties of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "more specifically , we will concentrate on the most general @xmath3 vertex including both cp - even and cp - odd components . instead of focusing on a specific model , it is convenient to parametrize this class of effects in a model independent manner via the effective lagrangian technique @xcite",
    ". it is assumed that these effects are induced by particles that are much heavier than the fermi scale and can thus be integrated out in the generating functional .",
    "this framework is quite appropriate to describe any physics phenomenon that is absent or very suppressed in the sm .",
    "apart from the advantages of working in a model - independent fashion , this approach has some additional advantages from the technical point of view .",
    "in particular , a two - loop calculation , as the one we are interested in , can be treated as a one - loop effect .",
    "below , we will discuss the structure of the effective @xmath3 vertex and its implications on the edm and mqm of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the @xmath4-invariant effective lagrangian description of the @xmath3 vertex is presented and used to determine its impact on the on - shell @xmath19 vertex at the one - loop level within the effective theory , whereas secs .",
    "iii and iv are devoted to discuss our results and present our conclusions , respectively .",
    "a scheme that is well suited to analyze new physics effects lying beyond the fermi scale consists in introducing @xmath4-invariant operators of dimension higher than four that modify the sm dynamics .",
    "in particular , the structure of the tree level @xmath3 vertex can be modified by introducing a dimension - six effective lagrangian given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath26 field strength , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the standard model higgs doublet . the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 parametrize the details of the underlying physics , and",
    "they could be determined once the fundamental theory is known . on the other hand , @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "are new different physics scales , the latter being associated with cp - violating effects .",
    "such anomalous higgs-@xmath0 interactions have already been considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "for instance , they were introduced to analyze the cp structure of the @xmath3 coupling at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , and more recently at next linear colliders ( nlc ) @xcite . also , it is worth mentioning that this vertex already arises at the one - loop level within the context of the sm provided that at least one @xmath0 boson is off - shell @xcite . for the purpose of this work ,",
    "it is enough to concentrate on the first and last terms of the lagrangian ( [ el ] ) .",
    "our main goal is to study the impact of this anomalous @xmath3 vertex on the cp - odd electromagnetic properties of the @xmath0 boson , which are generated at the one - loop level in the context of effective lagrangians .",
    "the most general on - shell @xmath19 vertex can be written as a linear combination of cp - even and cp - odd electromagnetic gauge structures @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the cp - even ( cp - odd ) component : @xmath36 + 2\\delta \\kappa ( q_\\beta g_{\\alpha \\mu}-q_\\alpha g_{\\beta \\mu})+\\frac{4\\delta q}{m^2_w}p_\\mu q_\\alpha q_\\beta,\\\\ \\gamma^o_{\\alpha \\beta \\mu}&=&2\\delta \\widetilde{\\kappa}\\epsilon_{\\alpha \\beta \\mu \\lambda}q^\\lambda+\\frac{4\\delta \\widetilde{q}}{m^2_w}q_\\beta \\epsilon_{\\alpha \\mu \\lambda \\rho}p^\\lambda q^\\rho.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the notation and conventions used in these expressions are shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath38 form factors define the cp - conserving electromagnetic moments of the @xmath0 boson , the magnetic dipole moment @xmath39 and the electric quadrupole moment @xmath40 , through the following relations @xmath41 on the other hand , @xmath5 and @xmath6 determine the cp - violating edm and mqm : @xmath42 we now turn to show that a @xmath3 vertex involving a linear combination of both cp - even and cp - odd couplings induces the @xmath43 and @xmath7 form factors at the one - loop level . as already mentioned , this is a two - loop or higher order effect since the effective operator @xmath44 can only be generated at one - loop or higher orders by the underlying theory @xcite .",

    "we have introduced the definition @xmath48 , being @xmath49 gev the fermi scale .",
    "notice that , due to @xmath4-invariance , the @xmath19 vertex receives contributions from both the trilinear @xmath3 and quartic @xmath50 couplings .",

    "[ fig2 ] , with the @xmath51 tensor given by @xmath52 in the unitary gauge , the cp - violating @xmath3 vertex contributes to the @xmath5 and @xmath7 form factors through the feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
    "it is worth noting that the effective lagrangian given in eq .",
    "( [ el ] ) generates nonrenormalizable dimension - five @xmath3 and @xmath53 vertices , which yield a divergent contribution to @xmath43 . after evaluating the feynman diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we arrive at an ultraviolet divergent amplitude , which is due to the presence of a nonrenormalizable interaction , thereby requiring a renormalization scheme . we have used the @xmath54 scheme with the renormalization scale @xmath55 , which leads to a logarithmic dependence of the form @xmath56 .",
    "after some algebra , the cp - odd form factors can be written in terms of two - point passarino - veltman scalar functions : @xmath57,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath58,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",

    "we turn now to our numerical results .",
    "the edm and mqm of the @xmath0 boson depend on three free parameters : the coupling constant @xmath30 , the new physics scale @xmath32 , and the higgs boson mass @xmath64 .",
    "as already mentioned , the effective operator @xmath65 can only be generated at one - loop or higher orders by the fundamental theory @xcite .",
    "assuming that it is induced at the one - loop level , the @xmath30 parameter must contain a factor of @xmath66 along with a @xmath67 coupling for each gauge field . from these considerations , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a dimensionless loop function , whose specific structure depends on the details of the underlying physics . since the cp - violating effects are expected to be of decoupling nature , @xmath70 is expected to be of the order @xmath71 at most . in order to make predictions , we will adopt a somewhat optimistic scenario , which consists in assuming that @xmath72 . we will thus make predictions under the assumption that @xmath73 has the following form @xmath74 we now would like to analyze the behavior of @xmath1 and @xmath2 as a function of @xmath64 and @xmath32 . the dependence of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) on the higgs boson mass is shown in fig .

    ", we would like to discuss the sm predictions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 . as already noted ,",
    "the lowest order nonzero contribution to @xmath1 arises at the three - loop level , whereas @xmath2 appears up to the two - loop order . at the lowest order ,",
    "@xmath1 has been estimated to be smaller than about @xmath87 e@xmath9 cm @xcite . as far as @xmath2 is concerned",
    ", it has been estimated to be about @xmath88 e@xmath9@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , some sm extensions predict values for @xmath1 that are several orders of magnitude larger than the sm one . it must be emphasized here that all these studies have focused only on @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , a value of @xmath89 e@xmath9 cm was estimated for @xmath1 in lrsm @xcite , and similar results were found in supersymmetric models , which induce this moment via one - loop diagrams mediated by charginos and neutralinos @xcite .",
    "also , a nonzero @xmath1 can arise through two - loop graphs in multi - higgs models @xcite .",
    "explicit calculations carried out within the context of thdms show that @xmath90 e@xmath9 cm @xcite . a similar value was found in the context of the so - called @xmath91 models , which induce a nonzero @xmath1 via two - loop graphs similar to the ones of thdm @xcite . from these results",
    ", we can conclude that our model - independent estimation for @xmath1 lies within the range of the predictions obtained from most popular renormalizable theories .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath0 edm and mqm can induce important contributions to the edm of light fermions .",
    "this fact was exploited by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , who used the experimental upper bound on the neutron edm , @xmath92 e@xmath9 cm , to obtain the upper bound @xmath93 e@xmath9 cm .",
    "our prediction for @xmath1 , which is eight orders of magnitude larger than that of the sm , is consistent with this upper bound .",
    "as far as @xmath2 is concerned , currently there is no indirect experimental upper bound , but we would like to emphasize that our result is quite remarkable as predicts that new physics effects are capable of enhancing @xmath2 up to fifteen orders of magnitude above the sm contribution .",
    "as far as the direct observation of the cp - odd structure of the @xmath19 vertex is concerned , the prospect of the nlc and clic @xcite have triggered the interest in the @xmath94 reaction as an efficient tool to produce large quantities of @xmath0 boson pairs , which would allow one to study new physics effects on the @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) vertex .",
    "the possibility of extracting cp - odd asymmetries from these colliders has been examined by several authors , mainly in a model - independent approach via effective lagrangians @xcite .",
    "these studies suggest that an effect in @xmath1 at the level of @xmath97 e@xmath9 cm may be at the experimental reach .",
    "also , it is expected that careful studies on the polar and azimuthal distributions of lepton - antilepton pairs produced in @xmath0 decays may further enhance the constraints on the size of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the origin of cp violation is a fascinating open problem worthwhile of both theoretical and experimental attention .",
    "although flavor - diagonal cp - violating processes , such as the electric dipole and magnetic quadrupole moments of the @xmath0 boson , are not induced by the ckm mechanism , their presence can not be dismissed since they may represent a genuine effect of physics lying beyond the fermi scale .",
    "this is suggested by many sm extensions predicting the existence of new sources of cp violation that may give sizeable contributions to the static quantities of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "as far as renormalizable theories are concerned , the yukawa sector of several sm extensions seems to be a potential source of cp violation since it may involve the presence of higgs bosons with both scalar and pseudoscalar couplings to the fermions . in this work",
    ", we examined such a possibility via the model - independent approach of effective lagrangians .",
    "we assumed the existence of new heavy fermions that generate the most general @xmath3 vertex at the one - loop level .",
    "such a cp - violating nonrenormalizable interaction was parametrized through an @xmath4-invariant operator and combined with the usual cp - even sm coupling to calculate the one - loop contribution to the cp - odd structure of the on - shell @xmath19 vertex .",
    "the fact that the dimension - six operator can only be generated at the one - loop level means that the cp - odd property of the @xmath19 vertex is a two - loop effect in the fundamental theory .",
    "explicit expressions for the form factors @xmath5 and @xmath7 , which define the edm and mqm of the @xmath0 boson , were derived .",
    "an appropriate renormalization scheme was adopted in order to renormalize the divergent form factor @xmath43 . as for the form factor @xmath7 ,",
    "its nondivergent nature reflects the fact that it can not arise at the one - loop level in any renormalizable theory . assuming reasonable values for the unknown parameters of the effective theory , the estimated values of the cp - odd electromagnetic moments are @xmath98 e@xmath9 cm and @xmath99 e@xmath9@xmath11 .",
