    "isolated high transverse energy ( `` prompt '' ) photon processes at hera could yield information about the quark and gluon content of the photon , together with the gluon structure of the proton .",
    "the particular virtue of prompt photon processes is that the observed final state photon emerges directly from a qcd diagram without the subsequent hadronisation which complicates the study of high @xmath3 quarks and gluons .    in a zeus paper",
    "@xcite the observation of prompt photons was first confirmed at hera .",
    "more recently  @xcite , zeus collaboration has measured the cross sections of inclusive prompt photons in photoproduction reactions , using an integrated luminosity of 38.4 pb@xmath4 .",
    "comparisons are made with predictions from monte carlo models containing leading - logarithm parton showers , and with next - to - leading - order qcd calculations , using currently available parameterisations of the photon structure .",
    "the data used here were obtained from @xmath5 running in 199697 at hera , with @xmath6 gev , @xmath7 gev .",
    "the major components in the analysis are the central tracking detector(ctd ) and the uranium calorimeter(ucal ) .",
    "prompt photons are detected in the barrel section of the calorimeter , which consists of an electromagnetic section ( bemc ) followed by two hadronic sections .",
    "it enable a partial discrimination between single @xmath8 signals and the decay product of neutral mesons .",
    "a typical high-  photon signal is observed in a small cluster of bemc cells , with no associated ctd track . an isolation cone was also imposed around photon candidates within a cone of unit radius in @xmath9 , to reduce backgrounds from dijet events with part of one jet misidentified as a single photon .    -1 cm    two shape - dependent quantities were studied in order to further distinguish @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 signals . these were ( 1 ) the mean width @xmath12  of the bemc cluster in @xmath13 and ( 2 ) the fraction @xmath14 of the cluster energy found in the most energetic cell in the cluster .",
    "the  distribution is shown in figure 1(a ) , in which peaks due to the @xmath8 and @xmath10 contributions are clearly visible .",
    "the tail quantified the @xmath11 background ; photon candidates in this region were removed .",
    "the extraction of the photon signal from the mixture of photons and a neutral meson background was done by means of the @xmath14 distribution . figure 1(b ) shows the shape of the @xmath14 distribution for the final event sample , after the  cut , fitted to the @xmath11 component determined from the distribution and freely - varying @xmath8 and @xmath10 contributions . above an @xmath14 value of 0.75 ,",
    "the distribution is dominated by the photons ; below this value it consists mainly of meson background .",
    "the numbers of candidates with @xmath15 and @xmath16 were calculated for the sample of events occurring in each bin of any measured quantity . from these numbers , and the ratios of the corresponding numbers for the @xmath14 distributions of the single particle samples ,",
    "the number of photon events in the given bin was evaluated .",
    "further details of the background subtraction method are given in reference .",
    "we evaluate cross sections for prompt photon production corrected by means of pythia using grv photon structure functions  @xcite .",
    "a bin - by - bin correction factors were applied to the detector ",
    "level measurements so as to correct to cross sections in the @xmath1 centre  of  mass energy 134  285 gev .",
    "the systematic error of 15% were taken into account and were finally combined in quadrature .",
    "the main contributions are from the energy scale of the calorimeter and the background subtraction . in presenting cross sections ,",
    "comparison is made with two types of theoretical calculation , in which the pdf sets taken for both the photon and proton can be varied . these are ( 1 ) pythia and herwig calculations evaluated at the final - state hadron level and ( 2 ) nlo parton  level calculations of gordon  @xcite(lg ) and of krawczyk and zembrzuski  @xcite(k&z ) .",
    "figure 2 ( a ) gives the inclusive cross ",
    "section @xmath17 for isolated prompt photons in the range @xmath18 .",
    "all the theoretical models describe the shape of the data well ; however the predictions of pythia and especially herwig are too low in magnitude .",
    "the lg and k&z calculations give better agreement with the data .",
    "the inclusive cross  section @xmath19 for isolated prompt photons in the range @xmath20 gev is shown in figure 2 ( b ) and compared with theoretical calculations , using two sets of photon pdf , gs  @xciteand grv .",
    "the lg and k&z calculations gives a good description of the data for forward ( proton direction ) @xmath2 range and are similar to pythia prediction .",
    "however all the calculations lie below the data in the lower @xmath2 range , where the curves using the gs parton densities give poorer agreement than those using grv .",
    "the discrepancy between data and theory at negative @xmath21 is found to be relatively strongest at low @xmath1 centre - of - mass energy range . in the lowest @xmath22 range ( 134170  gev ) ,",
    "both theory and data show a peaking at negative @xmath2 , but it is stronger in the data . in the highest @xmath22 range ( 212285  gev ) , agreement is found between theory and data .",
    "the movement of the peak can be qualitatively understood by noting that for fixed values of  and @xmath23 , where @xmath23 is the fraction of the incident photon energy that contributes to the resolved qcd subprocesses , measurements at increasing @xmath24 correspond on average to decreasing values of pseudorapidity . by varying the theoretical parameters ,",
    "the discrepancy was found to correspond in the k&z calculation to insufficient high @xmath23 partons in the resolved photon .",
    "the photoproduction of isolated prompt photons within the @xmath1 centre - of - mass energy range 134285 gev has been measured in the zeus detector at hera .",
    "inclusive cross sections have been presented as a function of  for photons in @xmath18 , and as a function of @xmath2 for photons with @xmath25 gev .",
    "comparisons have been made with predictions from lo monte carlos , and from nlo calculations .",
    "the models are able to describe the data well for forward @xmath2 , but are low in the rear direction .",
    "none of the available variations of the model parameters was found to be capable of removing the discrepancy with the data .",
    "this result would appear to indicate a need to review the present theoretical modelling of the parton structure of the photon .",
    "we are grateful to l. e. gordon , maria krawczyk and andrzej zembrzuski for helpful conversations , and for providing theoretical calculations ."
