    "a major goal of numerical relativity is to simulate the coalescence of an orbiting pair of black holes . in studying such systems , we will be interested in determining many quantities : the energy and momentum radiated , the associated waveforms , the total angular momentum of the system , etc .",
    "in addition to these common physical quantities , we will also want to understand the causal structure of the spacetime . not only will this give us a more complete picture of the dynamics , but it also seems that tracking the causal structure may prove to be a crucial step in successfully evolving black - hole spacetimes@xcite .",
    "knowing which events are inside black holes may allow them to be excised from the computational domain , thereby avoiding numerical difficulties that have plagued black hole evolutions .",
    "ideally , we would like to be able to track all of the event horizons in a given spacetime .",
    "however , this is not possible _ during _ the evolution : event horizons can only be reconstructed after the evolution is complete . instead , _",
    "apparent horizons _ can be located on each individual space - like hypersurface during an evolution .",
    "since apparent horizons must lie inside event horizons and asymptote towards them as the system settles down , they provide much of the desired causal information .",
    "they can also be used to define regions that can be excised from a computation .",
    "various methods exist for locating apparent horizons . in practice ,",
    "one searches for marginally outer - trapped surfaces ( mots)@xcite . the apparent horizon is the outermost such surface . for axisymmetric problems , shooting methods@xcite have been the most widely used for locating apparent horizons , although decomposition into orthogonal polynomials@xcite , the solution of elliptic boundary - value problems@xcite , and the use of curvature flows@xcite have been used",
    "unfortunately , shooting methods do not generalize to three - dimensional spatial slices .",
    "the first general apparent - horizon finders were based on a spherical - harmonic decomposition of the mots@xcite . in this approach , each coefficient in the spherical - harmonic expansion is determined , iteratively , by performing an integral over a complicated function that characterizes the mots .",
    "the mots equation can also be posed as an elliptic equation for a function that parametrically specifies the location of the mots@xcite .",
    "curvature flow methods are also certainly applicable in the general case of a three - dimensional spatial hypersurface .",
    "recently , a variant of the spherical - harmonic decomposition method has been proposed by libson _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "this approach is conceptually appealing , having two particularly nice features .",
    "first , the coefficients in the spherical - harmonic expansion are determined by a minimization procedure , eliminating the need to perform surface integrals .",
    "second , libson _",
    "et al_. have proposed the use of symmetric trace - free ( stf ) tensors for parametrically representing the mots .",
    "this latter feature is particularly appealing when cartesian coordinates are used on the three - dimensional hypersurface .    in this paper",
    ", we will review the method proposed by libson _",
    "et al_. and describe how we generalize the method by extending the expansion in stf tensors to arbitrary order . because one is always using a truncated expansion , it is important to understand clearly the behavior of the apparent - horizon finder when the maximum order of the expansion is varied .",
    "as we will see , the number of points where the mots is determined will also affect the behavior of the apparent - horizon finder .",
    "we have examined both of these effects in detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in   [ sec : methods ] we outline the method and basic equations , and in   [ sec : numerics ] we explain our numerical implementation . in   [ sec : tests ] we carefully discuss results from various test calculations , and in   [ sec : summary ] we briefly summarize the most important results .",
    "all technical details are provided in the appendices .",
    "appendix  [ app : expressions ] contains a number of useful equations relating to stf tensors .",
    "appendix  [ app : storage ] describes the storage for arbitrary rank tensors . in appendix",
    "[ app : init_recur ] we derive recurrence relations for stf tensors . finally , in appendix  [ app : area_elem ] we derive an expression for the area element on the apparent horizon .",
    "a mots is a closed two - surface embedded in a three - dimensional spatial hypersurface and , therefore , can be defined as a level surface of some scalar function @xmath0 .",
    "if we use cartesian coordinates on the hypersurface then we can parametrically define the level surface as @xmath1 here , @xmath2 are cartesian coordinates , @xmath3 is a location _ inside _ the @xmath4 surface , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are polar coordinates centered on @xmath3 .",
    "the function @xmath7 then measures the _ coordinate _ distance between @xmath3 and the @xmath8 surface in the direction @xmath9 .",
    "the outward pointing unit normal on the @xmath8 surface is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the normalization factor @xmath12^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] and @xmath13 is the metric on the spatial hypersurface .",
    "the expansion @xmath14 of an outgoing null - bundle can now be written @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the extrinsic curvature and @xmath17 is the covariant derivative operator associated with @xmath13 .",
    "note that the term @xmath18 involves both first and second derivatives of @xmath0 and hence of @xmath7 .",
    "writing these out explicitly yields @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the kronecker delta , @xmath21 is the unit vector in the @xmath9 direction , and @xmath22 are the connection coefficients associated with @xmath13 .",
    "one must be careful in deriving this equation since there are effectively two metrics being used : the spatial metric @xmath13 and the kronecker delta @xmath20 used in computing coordinate distances . in particular , we note that @xmath23    our goal is now to find a function @xmath7 such that the @xmath4 surface is a mots , i.e. that the expansion  ( [ theta ] ) vanishes on that surface . in practice , instead of making the expansion vanish , we can evaluate it at a number @xmath24 of points on the surface @xmath4 and look for a function @xmath25 such that @xmath26 vanishes .",
    "if ( [ ahsum ] ) vanishes for arbitrary weights @xmath27 , then in the limit @xmath28 ( so as to completely cover the surface ) we are guaranteed of having located a mots .",
    "our strategy will be to expand @xmath7 in terms of multipole moments and to search for a minimum in @xmath29 .",
    "the sum  ( [ ahsum ] ) then depends on the corresponding expansion coefficients , which can be varied until the sum assumes a minimum .",
    "if this minimum comes arbitrarily close to zero an apparent horizon has been found .",
    "thus , the problem has been reduced to a multidimensional minimization , for which standard methods can be used .",
    "an obvious choice of basis functions for the expansion of @xmath7 are the spherical harmonics , @xmath30 where the expansion is truncated at order @xmath31 .",
    "however , since we have to take up to second derivatives with respect to cartesian coordinates , an expansion in terms of stf tensors @xmath32 turns out to be a better choice . in the following",
    "we adopt the notation of  @xcite , where additional details of this formalism can be found .",
    "in particular , repeated indices will always be summed over .",
    "the subscript @xmath33 denotes a multi - index of length @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the vector product of @xmath34 unit vectors @xmath36 : @xmath37 in  ( [ stf ] ) , these are contracted with the stf tensors @xmath38 ( of rank @xmath34 ) .",
    "these are the _ location - independent _ expansion coefficients equivalent to the @xmath39 in  ( [ sph ] ) .",
    "note that a stf tensor of rank @xmath34 has @xmath40 independent components , just like the spherical harmonics .",
    "the relationship between  ( [ sph ] ) and  ( [ stf ] ) can be seen even more clearly by choosing the @xmath41 basis for the stf tensors as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see appendix  [ app : expressions ] ) . in terms of these , @xmath38 can be written @xmath42 where the @xmath39 are the same as in  ( [ sph ] ) .",
    "the @xmath41 also provide a relation between the spherical harmonics and the @xmath35 @xmath43 inserting this into  ( [ sph ] ) and using  ( [ sum ] ) immediately yields  ( [ stf ] ) .    note that because the coefficients @xmath38 are location independent , derivatives of @xmath25 can be calculated from derivatives of @xmath35 @xmath44 and similarly for second derivatives .",
    "our code is designed in such a way that it can find a mots to arbitrary order @xmath31 in the multipole expansion . on input",
    "we therefore have to specify the order @xmath31 .",
    "also , we have to specify the number of points @xmath24 on the surface at which the expansion  ( [ theta ] ) ( and , of course the sum for @xmath29 ) are evaluated .",
    "these points must be distributed somehow over the surface .",
    "currently , they are distributed equally in @xmath6 and @xmath45 on the unit sphere , but different choices could easily be made .",
    "results for different values of @xmath31 and @xmath24 will be presented in the next section .    next the tensors @xmath35 , their first and second derivatives , as well as the basis stf tensors @xmath41 have to be initialized .",
    "the latter are independent of location , so that we need to calculate them only once .",
    "the @xmath35 do , however , depend on the direction @xmath9 , and therefore have to be calculated once for every point on the surface . in the code , we define arrays of length @xmath24 to store @xmath35 and its derivatives .",
    "since all of the stf tensors are completely symmetric , we can store the independent components in a very elegant and efficient way .",
    "this is explained in detail in appendix  [ app : storage ] . in appendix",
    "[ app : init_recur ] we present recurrence relations that allow for a very efficient initialization of these objects .",
    "the mots search is started with a set of trial expansion coefficients @xmath39 .",
    "these are then contracted with the basis stf tensors @xmath41 , which yields the @xmath38 .",
    "since these quantities are independent of location , this needs to be done only once per iteration step .",
    "the @xmath38 are then contracted with @xmath35 and its derivatives to find @xmath25 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 for each direction @xmath9 .",
    "once @xmath25 is known we can construct the coordinate location @xmath48 of the trial surface ( @xmath4 ) at each of the @xmath24 points on the surface .",
    "for each point , we read in @xmath13 , @xmath16 and @xmath22 . these can either be numerically evolved quantities or , for the test purposes in this paper , analytical values .",
    "( [ theta ] ) now yields the expansion @xmath14 for this location on the trial surface . repeating these steps for every point @xmath24",
    "we can finally construct the sum @xmath29 . currently , we choose the weights @xmath27 in ( [ ahsum ] ) based on the proper area element ( [ area_elem ] ) defined in appendix  [ app : area_elem ] .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ ahsum ] ) is an approximation to the mean square of the expansion : @xmath49    any multidimensional minimization routine can now be used to vary the @xmath39 until @xmath29 has assumed a minimum .",
    "so far we have found best results with powell s method@xcite , although it is likely that a method that uses derivatives with respect to the expansion coefficients @xmath39 will be significantly faster , especially when the initial guess is already close to the final answer .",
    "we hope to explore this in the future .",
    "once a minimum has been found we shift the center of the black hole @xmath3 according to the dipole moment ( i.e.  we choose @xmath3 so that the @xmath50 moments vanish ) .",
    "we then repeat the mots search until the @xmath50 moments stay below a predetermined maximum value .",
    "this procedure enables us to locate apparent horizons even when the initial guess is very poor ( see next section ) and should allow us to follow black holes that move through a numerical grid .",
    "an obvious test for the apparent - horizon finder is the schwarzschild spacetime . since the mots is spherically symmetric , it can be described with the monopole term alone .",
    "this test strongly demonstrated how well the shifting of the center @xmath3 according to the @xmath50 moments works .",
    "the code was able to locate the mots accurately even when the initial guess was completely disjoint from the true horizon .",
    "the code worked equally well when we located the black hole away from the origin of the coordinate system . in all cases the sum @xmath29 , as well as all expansion coefficients @xmath39 with @xmath51 , vanished to whatever tolerance we specified .",
    "a spacetime containing two black holes has multiple mots , some of which can be highly distorted .",
    "such a spacetime provides a much stronger test for the apparent - horizon finder .",
    "a metric for two time - symmetric black holes can be written in the conformally - flat form @xmath52 where the conformal factor @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are @xmath57 here @xmath58 is the mass of the individual black holes , and @xmath59 is their coordinate distance from the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "note that the singularities in  ( [ confact ] ) can be removed by adding matter sources ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . since this is advantageous in a numerical application and does not change the external metric we have implemented this form of the equations .",
    "the causal structure of this spacetime has been investigated in detail by bishop@xcite .",
    "the mots can be found by using a shooting method to solve a set of coupled differential equations to high accuracy .",
    "this provides us with a solution that we can check the stf based apparent - horizon finder against . in the following",
    "we will refer to these solutions as the `` true horizons '' .",
    "in general there will be mots around the individual holes .",
    "if the holes are close enough , a pair of encompassing mots will also appear ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a careful discussion ) . according to ade  @xcite these encompassing",
    "mots first appear at as separation of @xmath60 . for separations close to the critical separation ( i.e.  @xmath61 )",
    "they will be strongly distorted .",
    "note that this situation is quite similar to what we expect in a binary black - hole evolution .",
    "having that application in mind , it provides a strong test for our apparent - horizon finder and it can help us to decide to which order @xmath31 we need to expand and at how many points @xmath24 we need to evaluate the expansion @xmath14 in order to accurately locate the an encompassing mots .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : location ] we plot the estimated location of the mots based on expansions to order @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the case @xmath66 .",
    "( by symmetry , only even @xmath31 can contribute since @xmath67 ) .",
    "the `` true horizon '' is fairly distorted , causing the lower order expansions to perform very poorly .",
    "note that all the lower order expansions find a location for the mots outside of the true horizon .",
    "this behavior could have severe consequences in numerical evolution codes that use `` apparent horizon boundary conditions''@xcite and that ignore the causally disconnected region inside a mots . if we were to use one of the lower - order mots solutions for this purpose we could be ignoring a region that is _ not _ causally disconnected .",
    "this test clearly demonstrates that high order expansion is absolutely necessary for the detection of highly distorted horizons . on the other hand",
    "it also demonstrates that high order expansion is very expensive : increasing the order of the expansion by 2 increases the cpu time by roughly a factor of 3 , ranging from several seconds for @xmath62 to several minutes for @xmath68 ( on a serial computer ) .",
    "details will depend on the particular numerical implementation as well as parameters associated with a given minimization routine .",
    "however , since we are searching for minima in an @xmath69-dimensional space ( see eq .",
    "( [ flm ] ) ) the required cpu time will always be a steep function of @xmath31 .",
    "another important factor for both the accuracy and the cpu time is the number of points @xmath24 at which the expansion @xmath14 is evaluated . in fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] we show results for @xmath70 using different numbers of points @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the number of points in the @xmath5-direction and @xmath73 in the @xmath6-direction .",
    "since the @xmath39 up to order @xmath31 have @xmath69 independent components , we will need at least @xmath69 points . from fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] it is obvious that @xmath74 points are not enough for an expansion to order @xmath75 : the result is worse than for a lower order expansion .",
    "however , it can also be seen that increasing the number of points beyond this minimum can drastically increase the accuracy .",
    "( 504,504 ) ( 0,268)=3.5 in ( 252,268)=3.5 in ( 0,16)=3.5 in ( 252,16)=3.5 in    as a next test we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : expansion ] the integral ( [ ahint ] ) as a function of @xmath59 for different expansion orders .",
    "for all these calculations we start with an initial guess close to where we expect a common mots . for @xmath76 ,",
    "when the two black holes have a common mots , we would therefore expect this sum to vanish , if we could resolve the mots arbitrarily well",
    ". for values of @xmath59 larger than @xmath77 the minimization routine will find a nonzero minimum ",
    "however we expect these minima to go to zero as we approach @xmath60 .",
    "since we use an expansion to finite order we can not resolve the mots arbitrarily well .",
    "this means that , while we will find a minimum , it will typically be different from zero even for @xmath76 .",
    "the value will , again , depend on a number of parameters , but primarily on the order of the expansion @xmath31 .",
    "this can be seen very clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : expansion ] .",
    "in particular for the lower order expansions the expected drop at @xmath60 can not be detected at all  a significant decrease can only be seen for @xmath68 .",
    "this demonstrates again that an early detection of a common mots will only be possible with a high order expansion .",
    "also , this suggests that it is hardly possible to decide on the basis of the value of the sum @xmath29 if a mots has been found . as a better test",
    ", we suggest checking whether @xmath14 is negative everywhere on a surface just inside the approximate mots . this surface `` just inside '' can be determined very easily by reducing the monopole term @xmath78 by a small fraction .",
    "we have developed an apparent - horizon finder based on a multipole expansion to arbitrary order @xmath31 .",
    "the primary application we have in mind is the numerical evolution of a binary black - hole system . in order to check the performance of the mots finder in a spacetime of similar structure",
    "we have performed careful tests using initial data for two time - symmetric black holes .    from these tests",
    "it is evident that a reliable search for highly distorted mots requires high order expansion . on the other hand ,",
    "using a high order expansion is very expensive and it is questionable if this will be affordable during a dynamical evolution .",
    "however , in the evolution of a binary black - hole system for example , it is desirable to detect a common mots as early as possible since the region interior to this surface no longer needs to be evolved .",
    "it may , therefore , be worthwhile searching for this common mots using a high order expansion .    as a compromise , it is possible to use a low order expansion for nearly spherical mots ( as will be the case for the mots around individual black holes or the common mots in the later phases of an evolution ) and a high order expansion for highly distorted mots ( as in the early phase of the common mots ) .",
    "unfortunately , `` nearly spherical '' is a coordinate dependent concept in this context , and it is not clear how well the coordinates will behave in a binary black - hole evolution code .",
    "an obvious optimization of the code is to change to a minimization scheme that uses derivatives .",
    "this is a fairly tedious , though straightforward task .",
