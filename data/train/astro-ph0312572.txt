    "high resolution uv spectra of @xmath10 quasars found in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) provide solid evidence that the intergalactic hydrogen was in a _ completely ionized _ state up to an early epoch of @xmath0 ( e.g. , fan etal .",

    "recently , cen ( 2003 ) proposed that the universe might have been reionized twice , where the first epoch was completed at @xmath1216 and the second epoch at @xmath0 .",
    "the first reionization is consistent with an early beginning of reionization suggested by the recent wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) results ( e.g. , spergel etal .",

    "it is still not certain what kind of objects provided the reionizing background .",
    "here we focus on the end of the reionization era at @xmath0 .",
    "there seems to be a consensus that the agn population is not sufficient to account for the entire required reionizing photon budget ( e.g. , fan etal . 2002 ) , which leaves @xmath13 star - forming galaxies as the only alternative . the discovery of @xmath14 emitters at @xmath15 ( hu etal .",

    "currently , the number of confirmed galaxies at @xmath0 is still insufficient to derive their lf in a conventional way .",
    "yan etal . ( 2002 ) presented an @xmath22 of the lf of galaxies at @xmath0 in terms of their cumulative surface density as a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "this estimate was made by using a schechter function , @xmath23,\\ ] ] with the values of its three free parameters adopted as following : the characteristic absolute magnitude @xmath24 ( measured around rest - frame 1300 ) and the faint - end slope @xmath7 obtained at @xmath3 ( steidel etal .",

    "( 2003 ) searched for such objects in their deep acs guaranteed time obsevation ( gto ) data .",
    "most recently , the goods team released its @xmath0 candidate list derived from the stacked three - epoch acs data ( dickinson etal .",
    "all these new observations agree with our @xmath0 lf .",
    "the goods candidate catalog has sufficient statistics to allow us to derive not just one , but several constraints at different flux levels from 25.0 to 27.0 mag .",
    "all these values agree very well with our lf from 23.0 to 26.5 mag . at @xmath30 mag ,",
    "the goods counts are significantly lower than our estimate , which is possibly due to the incompleteness of the catalog at the faint - end .",
    "to summarize , our lf broadly agrees with all known constraints , and is about the best that one can get with the available data so far .    for our purpose , an analytic form of the agn lf",
    "is preferred .",
    "the  standard \" double power - law quasar lf ( e.g. , boyle , fong & shanks 1988 ) is therefore used : @xmath31 this form has been proved to be a very good representation for quasars up to at least @xmath32 .",
    "there are four free parameters involved : the turn - over magnitude @xmath24 , the scaling factor @xmath4 , the bright - end slope @xmath33 , and the faint - end slope @xmath34 .",
    "the sdss has discovered 6 quasars at @xmath35 in 2870 deg@xmath36 to @xmath37 mag ( see fan etal .",
    "2003 ) . using this as the normalization , and adopting @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( fan etal .",
    "2001 ) , we obtain @xmath40 .",
    "the biggest uncertainty is the faint - end slope @xmath34 , which is essentially unknown for @xmath41 .",
    "therefore three values , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , are used .",
    "the first one is the value observed at @xmath45  3 , the second one is the steepest value that we consider to be reasonable , and the last one is the limiting case ( @xmath46 ) , which is considered for illustrative purposes only .",
    "the surface densities of agn at @xmath0 calculated based on these parameters are superposed in fig . 1 as blue curves .",
    "we first need to answer the following question : in order to keep the intergalactic hydrogen ionized at this redshift , what should be the critical ionizing photon emission rate per unit co - moving volume ( @xmath47 ) ? we can then find out if the integrated production rate of photons at @xmath48  due to either agn or galaxies meets this critical value .",
    "a recipe of calculating @xmath47 has been given in madau , haardt & rees ( 1999 , their eqn .",
    "26 ; hereafter mhr99 ) : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the ionized hydrogen clumping factor .",
    "choosing @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , one finds @xmath54 . as noted by mhr99 , the time - dependent clumping factor in this expression",
    "has be written in the form that is scaled to the value inferred at @xmath55 from the numerical simulation of gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) , which gave @xmath56 at @xmath55 .",
    "the total ionizing photon production rate , @xmath57 , due to a given population of objects , can be related to its differential lf , @xmath58 , via the following form ( yan 2003b ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is absolute magnitude ( in the ab system ) defined around rest - frame 1300 , @xmath61 is the luminosity distance ( in mpc ) to the objects in question , and @xmath62 is the absolute magnitude of the least luminous object that should be used in the integration .",
    "@xmath63 is a constant whose value depends on the shape of the uv - sed of these objects , which can be represented by power laws . to be specific , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are power - law indices ( in the frequency domain ) for @xmath67912 and 912@xmath68 1400 , respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath69 is the continuum discontinuity factor across the lyman limit at 912 .",
    "following mhr99 , we assume that the shape of the sed of a quasar has power - law indices of 1.8 at @xmath70 1050 and 0.8 at 1050@xmath712500 , respectively . using these values and the agn lf described in  2",
    ", it is found that the contribution from agn falls far short of the critical value @xmath47 for any reasonable faint - end lf slope ( see also lehnert & bremer ( 2003 ) for their discussion at @xmath72 ) .",
    "integrated to @xmath73 mag beyond which the existence of agn activity becomes implausible , their total contribution are @xmath74 and @xmath75 s@xmath21 mpc@xmath28 for the faint - end slopes of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . even for the limiting case where @xmath76 ,",
    "the derived @xmath77 value is only @xmath78 s@xmath21 mpc@xmath28 .",
    "based on 29 lbg spectra at @xmath3 , steidel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) measured the ratio of the continuum flux at rest - frame 1300 and at the blue side of the lyman limit to be @xmath79 4.6 .",
    "this is equivalent to taking @xmath80 in our expression for @xmath63 , and is used hereafter .",
    "note that by using this value , we implicitly adopt the lyman continuum photon escaping fraction ( @xmath81 ) of steidel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which is 1013% in absolute terms .",
    "the index @xmath66 used in the following analysis was estimated by using a set of model spectra of galaxies with ages of 0.1 gyr ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) , and it was found that this sed slope is close to an equivalent power - law index of @xmath82 .",
    "we find that the original lf estimate of yan etal .",
    "( 2002 ) , which has a relatively shallow slope of @xmath2 , can not produce a large enough @xmath57 that reaches @xmath47 .",
    "this lf can account for about 67% of the critical value if eqn . 2",
    "is integrated to @xmath83 mag , but the integral increases only very slowly towards fainter magnitudes and never meets @xmath47 , even when pushed to globular - cluster - type luminosities ( @xmath84 mag ) .",
    "modifying our lf by adopting a luminosity evolution scheme of @xmath85 , such as @xmath86=3@xmath87 , will not mitigate this problem , because the value of @xmath88 is negative in a reasonable hierarchical structure formation model , and thus will make @xmath89 fainter and the @xmath57 value even less .",
    "thus we explore other steeper @xmath7 values to see if @xmath47 can be met at a reasonable minimum luminosity .",
    "we consider @xmath90 , and @xmath43 , where the steepest one is the critical value at which the integral of a schechter function diverges if the integration is carried to infinitely low luminosity .",
    "for these slopes to meet the normalizing condition ( cumulative surface density of 1.37 per arcmin@xmath36 to @xmath91 mag ; see yan etal .",
    "2002 ) , @xmath4 has to be 4.27 , 4.00 , 3.74 , and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "we find that @xmath47 can be reached at the following critical absolute magnitudes for the above slopes , respectively : @xmath93 8.8 , 14.6 , 15.8 , and 16.6 mag ( at @xmath0 these corresponds to apparent magnitudes of 37.9 , 32.1 , 30.9 , and 30.1 mag , respectively ) . in other words , the @xmath8 luminous galaxies that the universe should have produced by",
    "this redshift should be at these magnitude levels or fainter in order to have a fully ionized universe at @xmath0 .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "2 ( top panel ) .",
    "the quantitative results above depend on three factors , namely , the clumpiness of ionized hydrogen ( @xmath50 ) , the scaling factor of the lf of galaxies ( @xmath4 ) , and the escaping fraction of lyman continuum photons ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the first one affects the value of @xmath47 , while the last two affect @xmath77 .",
    "the value of @xmath47 scales linearly with the clumping factor @xmath50 . in eqn .",
    "1 , this clumping factor is scaled to its value at @xmath55 .",
    "we followed mhr99 and adopted @xmath52 , which is suggested by the numerical simulations of gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) .",
    "should @xmath50 drop to @xmath79 20 , @xmath47 would drop by 1/3 , and a faint - end slope steeper than @xmath2 would no longer be required , since now @xmath57 would reach the critical absolute magnitude at @xmath83 mag .",
    "similarly , steeper slopes , @xmath94 1.7 , 1.8 , 1.9 , and 2.0 would make @xmath77 reach the critical absolute magnitude at @xmath9317.0 , 17.4 , 17.7 , and 17.9 mag , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath57 scales linearly with the scaling factor @xmath4 of the lf . since",
    "increasing @xmath57 has the same effect as decreasing @xmath47 , we get exactly the same answers as above , if the scaling factor increases by a factor of 1.5 . since @xmath57 also scales linearly with @xmath81 ( assuming it is not a function of luminosity ) , the same answers hold if @xmath81 increases by the same factor .",
    "on the other hand , if either @xmath4 or @xmath81 drops by 1/3 , a faint - end slope steeper than 1.8 is necessary to reionize the universe . in this case",
    ", @xmath47 can be reached at @xmath95 and 14.7 mag for a slope of 1.9 and 2.0 , respectively .",
    "smaller @xmath4 or @xmath81 requires the lf extend to fainter luminosity ; however , if either of them is smaller by a factor of two , only @xmath5 can meet the reionization requirement .",
    "these values give the critical luminosity that the least luminous galaxies should have , i.e. , a lower limit to @xmath60 . by considering the additional constraint that the intergalactic hydrogen at slightly earlier epoch still had a non - negligible neutral fraction",
    ", we can further improve these limits into two - sided luminosity ranges .",
    "cen ( 2003 ) gave a detailed modeling of the evolution of intergalactic medium in the double - reionization scheme , and the neutral fraction inferred from this modeling is about 15% at @xmath9 .",
    "the precise neutral fraction at a specific redshift does not matter too much for our purpose ; the point is that at an earlier epoch , e.g. at @xmath9 , the total ionizing photon production rate of galaxies should not exceed the critical value such that a significant amount of neutral hydrogen can still exist , otherwise no gp - trough would be seen at @xmath0 .",
    "the calculation can be performed similarly to that described in  3 . to first order",
    ", we can assume that there is no evolution in the lf during the relatively short time period from @xmath53 to 7 , which is only 0.16 gyr .",
    "at @xmath96 , @xmath97 s@xmath21 mpc@xmath28 for the nominal @xmath50 value of 30 .",
    "now the requirement is @xmath98 .",
    "if nothing else changes , a lf faint - end slope of 1.8 or shallower will satisfy this criterion .",
    "steeper slopes of @xmath94 1.9 and 2.0 require that the lf truncates before it reaches @xmath93 12.5 and 14.6 mag , respectively .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "2 demonstrates these results .",
    "if @xmath99 , or equivalently if either @xmath4 or @xmath81 is increased by a factor of 1.5 , it requires that the lf truncates before it reaches @xmath93 12.4 , 15.8 , 16.9 , and 17.5 mag for slopes of 1.7 , 1.8 , 1.9 , and 2.0 , respectively ( a cut - off is not required for a slope of 1.6 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if either @xmath4 or @xmath81 is decreased by 1/3 , or equivalently if @xmath100 , slopes of 1.9 and 2.0 require the lf truncate before it reaches @xmath93 4.4 and 11.8 mag .",
    "table 1 summarizes these results .",
    "we note that case a ) is what we believe to be the most plausible , given our best knowledge about the relevant parameters .",
    "case b ) and c ) , on the other hand , explore a wider parameter space . however , we point out that case b ) is not very likely for several reasons .",
    "first , the clumping factor is not likely to be as low as 20 , since the nominal value of @xmath52 obtained by gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) might already have underestimated the true value because of the finite resolution of their simulation .",
    "second , the scaling factor of the lf , @xmath4 , is not likely to be significantly higher than the value suggested in yan etal .",
    "( 2002 ) , otherwise all the recent searches for @xmath0 objects would have resulted in more bright ( @xmath101-band @xmath102 mag ) candidates than what have been actually observed .",
    "third , the lyman photon escaping fraction of star - forming galaxies is not likely to be much higher than @xmath79 1013% , given that such a value already seems to be rather high ( cf .",
    "giallongo etal .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the ultra deep field ( udf ) campaign of the acs / hst ( http://www.stsci.edu/hst/udf ) , whose data are now being taken and will be released to the public in february 2004 , will greatly narrow down the range of @xmath7 . depending on its the real value , we predict a total of 50 to 80 genuine @xmath0 objects in the udf to its designed 10 @xmath103 depth of 28.4 mag .",
    "in this paper we investigate the major sources of reionization at @xmath0 based on the best available observational constraints . using the lf estimate proposed for galaxies at this redshift ( yan etal .",
    "2002 ) as the starting point , we find that @xmath13 galaxies can account for the entire reionizing background , provided that the faint - end slope of their lf is steep enough and that the lf extends to sufficiently low luminosity .",
    "we explore a range of faint - end slopes , from @xmath2 , a value that the lf has at @xmath3 , to @xmath5 , the critical value at which the integration of a schechter lf diverges .",
    "we find that dwarf galaxies , rather than their more luminous counterparts or agn , produced the vast majority of the reionizing photons at @xmath0 .",
    "using the best estimate of the relevant parameters , we find that the faint - slope of the lf of galaxies at @xmath0 should be steeper than 1.6 , if the adopted @xmath4 holds , or as steep as @xmath5 if @xmath4 is lower by a factor of two . in addition , we show that the least luminous galaxies should be fainter than a certain critical luminosity , whose exact value depends on the actual faint - end slope .",
    "furthermore , by requiring that there still was a non - negligible neutral hydrogen fraction at slightly earlier epochs ( @xmath9 ) , we point out that the lf should truncate at a certain luminosity threshold , whose value again depends on the actual faint - end slope .",
    "the hst udf data will be able to narrow down the range of this important parameter , whose precise value is obviously important for planning the performance of the james webb space telescope .",
