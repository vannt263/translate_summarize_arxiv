    "its unclear how differences in the assumed parametric forms for the hod affect the modeling results . on small scales ,",
    "pairs of galaxies in the same halo dominate the clustering signal .",
    "an accurate knowledge of the number density distribution of galaxies in a single halo and the satellite fraction ( fraction of galaxies of a given luminosity which are satellites ) are required to model this signal ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the occupation number of satellites in halos of a given mass is often assumed to be distributed in a poisson manner , which is perhaps a questionable assumption ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "the transition region where the clustering of galaxies is equally composed of pairs from the same halo and those from separate halos has also been notoriously difficult to model .",
    "an accurate knowledge of the scale dependence of the bias and an accurate treatment of halo exclusion is central to model the clustering in this region @xcite . given all these complications , it is important to test for consistency of the small scale clustering results with the independent measurement from the large - scale power spectrum of galaxies , especially as precision constraints on cosmological parameters are being obtained from the modeling of small - scale clustering ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another potential systematic effect concerns the range of integration used along the line - of - sight , @xmath115 , to project the 3-dimensional correlation function to obtain @xmath116 . in figure @xmath117 of @xcite ,",
    "the authors show that the projection of the correlation function by integrating in redshift space upto @xmath118 gives results that are systematically larger compared to results when the integration is carried out in real space .",
    "the difference between these results is as large as @xmath119 on scales of @xmath120 with differences which increase with scale and grow as large as @xmath121 at scales of @xmath44 .",
    "the projection is supposed to get rid of the redshift distortions but only when the integration is done along the entire line - of - sight . however , when the integration is done only out to a certain maximum value ( @xmath122 is a commonly used value ) , the large scale redshift distortions ( known as the kaiser effect ) may still persist .",
    "this can cause an overestimate of the correlation function corresponding to an overestimate of the galaxy bias .",
    "the exact overestimate will depend upon the quantity @xmath123 our preliminary estimates of the effect indicate that it can reduce the discrepancy between the two measures of the galaxy bias but not entirely eliminate it . the galaxy bias measurements from z10 when the kaiser effect is included should be smaller than those shown in figure  [ fig1 ] by roughly 1 @xmath90 .",
    "we intend to pursue the issue of estimating the magnitude of the kaiser effect on the projected clustering measurements , its dependence on @xmath115 and comparisons with n - body simulations in future work .",
    "the luminosity dependence of the galaxy bias obtained by t04 was used in conjunction with hod modeling of the galaxy - galaxy lensing results by @xcite to obtain constraints in the @xmath124 plane .",
    "it is unclear how the likelihood contours obtained by these authors will shift in the @xmath124 plane if they were to use the small scale clustering results instead .",
    "future analyses which combine galaxy - galaxy lensing and clustering data should be able to shed more light on this issue .",
    "the luminosity dependence of the galaxy bias has also been used to obtain an effective halo mass for galaxies of a given luminosity ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "one should be aware that the systematics highlighted in this paper will lead to large uncertainties in the halo masses especially at the bright end .",
    "the lrg power spectrum measurements @xcite use the @xmath45 obtained by t04 to correct for the red - tilt of the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the shape of @xmath45 shown in this paper can cause a residual scale - dependence in the galaxy power spectrum modifying its shape and systematically bias the estimates of the cosmological parameters derived from it .",
    "a consistent understanding of galaxy bias and the systematics associated with each of the methods is therefore crucial to obtain precision constraints on cosmological parameters from the galaxy distribution .",
