    "density functional theory ( dft ) is one of the great successes in tackling the many - electron problem@xcite .",
    "density - dependent exchange - correlation potentials , such as the local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximations ( ggas ) , are useful and surprisingly accurate for many properties of materials despite the known deficiencies of these functionals .",
    "generally , the lda slightly underestimates lattice constants , while ggas slightly overestimate them and both underestimate single - particle band gaps in solids.@xcite the exchange energy can be calculated exactly using the non - local hartree - fock ( hf ) formalism , rather than being approximated as part of the lda or gga .",
    "however pure hf grossly overestimates band gaps in solids and is considerably more expensive computationally because of the fully non - local nature of the exchange operator .",
    "the central theorem of density functional theory@xcite demonstrates that a local potential @xmath0 is sufficient to completely define a many - electron system in the ground state .",
    "a local potential that includes the effect of the exact exchange interaction was first proposed by sharp and horton@xcite and solved nearly a quarter of century later by talman and shadwick.@xcite this potential is known as the optimized effective potential ( oep ) , because a local potential is created to optimally represent the non - local hf exchange potential .",
    "the total energy of the oep system is variational with the potential in the same way the lda or gga total energy is variational in the electronic density .",
    "this allows the construction of equations to describe the potential within a kohn - sham dft formalism .",
    "the resultant single particle excitation energies agree much better with experiment than those calculated using the lda , ggas and hf.@xcite    the improved oep description of excited states is a consequence of the freedom from self - interaction error of both occupied and unoccupied kohn - sham states@xcite . within the lda and",
    "ggas the potential experienced by all states includes some degree of self - interaction@xcite . in hf",
    "the exchange term cancels the self - interaction error in the occupied states , but no such cancellation is present for the unoccupied states .",
    "this results in too small an electronic band gap using the lda and ggas and too large in hf@xcite .",
    "there is a distinction between the fundamental band gap of a material and the corresponding kohn - sham gap . the kohn - sham gap ( @xmath1 ) is defined as the difference between the eigenvalues of the highest occupied orbital and the lowest unoccupied orbital @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the eigenvalue of the @xmath4th orbital and n is the total number of electrons in the system .",
    "whereas the fundamental band gap ( @xmath5 ) is defined as the difference in the ionization potential and the electron affinity @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ionization potential , @xmath8 is the electron affinity and @xmath9 is the total energy of a @xmath10 electron system .",
    "the two are related by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the derivative discontinuity in xc energy with respect to particle number.@xcite this constant is the energy associated with a change in the exchange - correlation potential when a infinitesimal charge is added to a @xmath10 electron system .",
    "while a comparison between the kohn - sham and fundamental band gaps would be instructive , the value of the derivative discontinuity is unknown for most real materials .",
    "( see however godby _ _ et al__@xcite and gorling _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite )    in finite systems , the exchange potential should decay as -1/r in the long - range limit for all states . in the oep this decay occurs for all states irrespective of occupancy . in hf",
    "the non - local potential for occupied states behaves correctly but for the empty states decays exponentially and in the lda / gga the potential for all states decays exponentially@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the orbitals in the oep each correctly decay with an individual exponent , whereas in hf all occupied orbitals decay with the same exponent .",
    "@xcite    the oep is potentially as versatile as lda / gga and hf methods .",
    "it could be used instead of hf as a foundation for orbital - dependent potentials ( so called hybrid functionals)@xcite . furthermore once the local potential has been obtained ,",
    "the calculation of system properties is faster than hf based methods , as the computationally expensive application of the exchange operator is avoided .    while the oep correctly describes many system properties ( see grabo _ _",
    "et al__@xcite ) , it is not as widely used as the lda , gga and hf - hybrid based methods .",
    "this can be attributed in part to the lack of comparably efficient and robust computational schemes to evaluate it . in most formulations of the oep method",
    "a sum over all excited states is required and truncation to a finite sum yields a slowly - convergent series .",
    "furthermore an accurate description of these high energy states requires large basis sets at high computational expense if a local basis description is used . despite these deficiencies ,",
    "some calculations have been done in solids within the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) basis set@xcite , the fplapw method@xcite as well as in plane - wave pseudopotential implementations@xcite .",
    "the agreement of the calculated results in the previous work above with experiment can be very good ( see ref . [ ] ) .",
    "however most applications have been to semiconductors . for wide - gap insulating systems the performance of the oep can be poor , notably for noble - gas solids.@xcite see ref .",

    "were chosen so that total energy differences , evaluated using the lda , were less than 1 mev / atom .",
    "the same settings were used for the oep calculations , which resulted in a very similar convergence error with cutoff as the lda case .",
    "however the oep calculations were more sensitive to brillouin - zone sampling error ; for example , in the case of diamond , @xmath59 resulted in a 1 mev / atom error using the lda but 3 mev for oep rising to 9 mev for zno .",
    "convergence testing was also performed on the fft grid used to represent the potential and the energy error was determined to be @xmath60ev .",

    "the resultant band gaps are shown in table  i and for the lda , oep and hartree - fock calculations are also plotted in figure  [ fig : linegraph ] . the mean absolute error is 0.55ev for the oep , 1.39ev for the lda and 1.19ev for pbe , although these values are skewed by the underestimated values for the band gap found for diamond , nacl and cao materials .",
