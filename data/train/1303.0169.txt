    "a central problem in the study of deterministic dynamical systems is to identify different types of asymptotic behavior of a given system and to understand how the behavior changes as the system parameter changes  @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic behavior can be , for instance , a periodic oscillation , a quasiperiodic motion , a sna , or a random or a chaotic motion  @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable work in the past addressing how dynamical systems develop chaos from periodic or quasiperiodic motions and how they can be characterized by various diagnostic tools such as lyapunov exponents , fractal dimemsion and recurrence analysis .",
    "some among these like the lyapunov exponents and fractal dimension also require substantial amounts of data , free of noise , in order to perform well .",
    "recently , a much simpler test for the presence of deterministic chaos was proposed by gottwald and melbourne  @xcite .",
    "their 0 - 1 test for chaos takes as input a time series of measurements , and returns a single scalar value either 0 for periodic attractors or 1 for chaotic attractors .",
    "the test does not require phase space recontruction .",
    "the dimension of the dynamical system and the form of the underlying equations are in general irrelevant , and the input is just the time series data",
    ". the test returns a unit value in the presence of deterministic chaos and zero otherwise .",
    "recently , many works have been carried out in this connection , including reliability of the 0 - 1 test  @xcite , characterization of noisy symbolic time series  @xcite and efficient time series detection in fpu lattices  @xcite .",
    "however all these studies focused only on distinguishing between regular and chaotic motions . in the present work we investigate and characterize the performance of the 0 - 1 test when applied to quasiperiodically forced dynamical systems exhibiting snas .",
    "+ snas which are commonly found in quasiperiodically forced systems were first described by grebogi et al  @xcite .",
    "these attractors are geometrically strange as they are properly described by a fractal dimension but the largest nontrivial lyapunov exponent is negative , implying nonchaotic dynamics . briefly speaking , a sna has a complicated ( fractal ) structure but does not have a positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "trajectories separate at rates that are slower than an exponential divergence  @xcite .",
    "snas have been reported in many physical systems such as the quasiperiodically forced pendulum  @xcite , biological oscillators  @xcite , and quantum particles in quasiperiodic potentials  @xcite , which are also related to the anderson localization in the schr@xmath0dinger equation  @xcite . also , these exotic attractors were confirmed by an experiment consisting of a quasiperiodically forced , buckled , magnetoelastic ribbon  @xcite , in analog simulations of a multistable potential  @xcite , neon glow discharge experiment  @xcite , chemical oscillations  @xcite and various electronic circuits  @xcite .",
    "snas can be quantitatively characterized by a variety of methods , including the estimation of lyapunov exponents and fractal dimension  @xcite and spectral properties  @xcite .",
    "the geometric strangeness of the attractor can be measured through indices such as the phase - sensitivity exponent  @xcite , while the chaoticity properties can be studied by examining the finite - time lyapunov exponents  @xcite .",
    "the transition from quasiperiodic to chaotic motion via snas can be studied by both the variance of finite time lyapunov exponents and the recurrence plots  @xcite .",
    "the quasiperiodic ( torus ) attractor and snas are characterized by the lyapunov exponents with zero and negative values , respectively . however , for quasiperiodically forced dynamical systems , the values of the lyapunov exponents are negative for both quasiperiodic attractors(tori ) and snas . in this case",
    "the lyapunov exponents fail to detect transitions from quasiperiodic dynamics to snas . moreover , analytical methods such as the approximation of quasiperiodic forcing by a series of rational approximations , or the analysis of the phase sensitivity of the dynamics demand a knowledge of the underlying map or differential equations which is often not available .",
    "however in the present work for the first time it is reported that the 0 - 1 test clearly distinguishes tori , snas and chaos , from the time series alone .",
    "in particular this test indicates a value 0 for torus , a value in between 0 and 1 for sna , and for chaos a value that tends to 1. + the mechanisms and routes for the birth of snas , their characterization in different dynamical systems , and tools for distinguishing different dynamical transitions to snas were reported in  @xcite . among the different routes to snas ,",
    "heagy - hammel , fractalization and intermittency transitions are ubiquitous in quasiperiodically driven nonlinear systems . in the present paper",
    ", we employ the 0 - 1 test to characterize different dynamical transitions to snas , in particular the heagy - hammel , fractalization and intermittent transitions .",
    "specifically , the 0 - 1 test characterization for transition to snas is examined in quasiperiodically driven logistic map , cubic map and parametrically driven duffing oscillator to validate our conclusions . + the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we briefly review the 0 - 1 test .",
    "in sec.iii we report the applicability of the 0 - 1 test to quasiperiodically driven systems .",
    "sec.iv examines the characterization using the 0 - 1 test for different routes of creation of snas , while in sec.v we discuss the transition from snas to chaos .",
    "the final section gives our conclusions . in appendix",
    "a we briefly describe our procedure to identify an optimal value for the parameter @xmath1 required for the 0 - 1 test . in appendix b we briefly analyze the behaviors of the translation variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the asymptotic growth rate @xmath4 as a function of the length of the time series @xmath5 . in appendix c",
    "we present the nature of attractors in the quasiperiodically forced cubic map using the 0 - 1 test .",
    "finally , in appendix d we analyze the distribution of local asymptotic growth rate @xmath6 along with finite time lyapunov exponents(ftles ) for a statistical evaluation of the results .",
    "consider an n - dimensional dynamical system @xmath7 , @xmath8 and denote a solution of the underlying system as @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be an observable of the underlying system .",
    "the 0 - 1 test uses the observable to drive the dynamics on a well chosen euclidean extension , and then exploits a theorem from nicol et al  @xcite , which states that the dynamics on the group extension is bounded if the underlying dynamics is nonchaotic , but it behaves like a brownian motion if the dynamics is chaotic .",
    "the 0 - 1 test for chaos first appeared in  @xcite .",
    "it is designed to distinguish chaotic behavior from regular behavior in deterministic systems .",
    "the test results in a value 1 if the system is chaotic and a 0 if the system is regular .",
    "theoretical justification was given to the 0 - 1 test in  @xcite .",
    "an implementation technique was also proposed for the 0 - 1 test in  @xcite , which has been very useful for the present work . here",
    "we present a brief outline of the 0 - 1 test followed by a modified version of the 0 - 1 test illustrated in  @xcite .",
    "consider a time series of length @xmath5 .",
    "the 0 - 1 test begins with a computation of two variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 which are the so - called translation variables : @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 + here @xmath16 is an observable constructed from the time series .",
    "the value of @xmath1 may be chosen randomly in the interval ( 0,2@xmath17 ) for nonquasiperiodic systems  @xcite .",
    "one may note that it is the behavior of these translation variables that determines whether the dynamics of the system is regular or chaotic .",
    "the translation variables also exhibit a brownian motion as a function of @xmath18 , when the dynamics is chaotic . for brownian motion",
    "we expect the average of [ @xmath19-@xmath20 and [ @xmath21-@xmath22 to grow like @xmath23 for @xmath24 therefore the square of [ @xmath19-@xmath20 and [ @xmath21-@xmath25 should asymptotically approach a linear growth proportional to @xmath18 for sufficiently large values .",
    "hence , to find the behavior of the translation variables the 0 - 1 test calculates their mean square displacement @xmath26 ,    @xmath27^{2 } + \\left [ q(j+n ) - q(j ) \\right]^{2}\\ ] ]    however , in order to obtain a better convergence of mean square displacement , for numerical purpose , we have used a modified mean square displacement @xmath28(which exhibits the same asymptotic growth rate as @xmath29 ) of the form as suggested in  @xcite @xmath30    where @xmath31 the theory behind the 0 - 1 test shows that if the dynamics of the system is regular , then ( 4 ) is bounded in time .",
    "however if the dynamics of the system is chaotic then ( 4 ) scales linearly in time . for numerical purpose , with the limit in ( 4 ) , we must use @xmath32 . in practice , the limit @xmath28 exists when @xmath33 , where one expects @xmath28 to scale linearly .",
    "the dynamics is further characterized through the computation of the asymptotic growth rate @xmath4 which can be calculated directly from @xmath28 by using a linear regression for the log - log plot of @xmath28 given by the defnition , @xmath34 it has been pointed out in  @xcite that the linear regression method leads to a distortion for small values of @xmath18 .",
    "hence , it has been recommended  @xcite to estimate the asymptotic growth rate @xmath4 by using a correlation method which works better than the linear regression method . in the present work",
    "we employ the correlation method for the estimation of @xmath4 . in this procedure",
    ", @xmath4 is the correlation coefficient of the vectors    @xmath35    now one can define the correlation coefficient @xmath36 \\label{k - eq}.\\ ] ]    here @xmath37    where @xmath38    finally a value of @xmath39 indicates a non - chaotic data set while a value of @xmath40 indicates a chaotic data set .",
    "we use the above analysis to characterize snas from quasiperiodic and chaotic attractors by properly choosing the value of c in eqs.(1)-(2 ) for quasiperiodic dynamical systems .",
    "+ the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 in eq.(1 ) can be viewed as a component of the solution to the skew product system , @xmath41",
    "@xmath42 @xmath43 + driven by the dynamics of the observable @xmath44 . here ( @xmath45,@xmath46,@xmath47 ) represent the coordinates on the euclidean group rotation @xmath45 and translation @xmath48 in the plane .",
    "it was argued that an inspection of the dynamics of the ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) trajectories provides a quick and simple visual test of whether the underlying dynamics is regular or chaotic  @xcite .",
    "the above 0 - 1 test , when applied in the standard way to quasiperiodically forced systems , exhibiting snas , does not clearly distinguish snas from torus and chaotic attractors .",
    "the 0 - 1 test returns either a value 0 or 1 for the snas depending on the route by which they are created , as long as the parameter @xmath1 in eqs.((1)-(2 ) ) is chosen as an arbitray number in the interval ( 0,2@xmath17 ) .",
    "in fact , in a recent study dawes and freeland  @xcite have attempted to distinguish between quasiperiodic attractors and snas with a modification of the 0 - 1 test by the addition of noise with the mean square displacement .",
    "in particular , by choosing the value of @xmath1 to be equally spaced in the interval ( 0.1,@xmath49 ) , they showed that for a quasiperiodic attractor @xmath4 takes a value zero and for a sna it takes a value 1 with large deviations for certain values of @xmath1 . however",
    "this method does not distinguish snas from chaotic attractors . in the present study",
    ", we have chosen the value of @xmath1 in terms of the golden mean number like @xmath50 or @xmath51 , where @xmath52 to characterize snas in quasiperiodically forced dynamical systems , so as to avoid resonance with the translation variables .",
    "details are given in appendix a. with such a choice , we find that we can clearly distinguish torus , sna and chaos as well as different dynamical transitions involving snas . these are discussed in detail in the following .",
    "+ in our numerical analysis the value of the asymptotic growth rate @xmath4 is computed by taking the average of it over a number of segments in the given trajectory .",
    "that is , a given trajectory is divided into a number of segments each of length @xmath53 and , in each of these , the corresponding asymptotic growth rate @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 denotes the segment ) is evaluated .",
    "finally the average is taken to compute the value of @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , we consider a total time series of length @xmath56 for both quasiperiodically forced logistic map and cubic map while for quasiperiodically forced double well duffing oscillator we take @xmath57 ( for continuous systems the data points are considered after sampling the time series data ) . in the total time series",
    "@xmath58 data points is considered as the length of each segment .",
    "+ we also note here that the qualitative nature of the attractors , the trajectories in the translation variables @xmath48 space , and the mean square displacement essentially remain unchanged as a function of @xmath5 ( as discussed in appendix b ) .",
    "so whenever these quantities are displayed in the following , we use @xmath59 data points , but for the calculation of @xmath4 we use a much larger time series as mentioned above .",
    "in this section we consider the applicability of the 0 - 1 test for quasiperiodically forced dynamical systems to identify snas and distinguish them from periodic , quasiperiodic and chaotic attractors .",
    "we choose the following models of quasiperiodically forced dynamical systems for our present study ; + ( i)*_quasiperiodically forced logistic map _ * : + the dynamics is described by the coupled map  @xcite ,    @xmath60 x_{n}(1-x_{n } ) , \\\\ & & \\theta_{n+1}=\\theta_{n}+\\omega\\,(mod\\ , 1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 is the irrational driving frequency , @xmath61 represents the forcing amplitude , and @xmath62 is a driving parameter . the different dynamical regimes can be characterized by using the rescaled parameter of the forcing amplitude @xmath63 versus @xmath62 . in this map the transition from torus to snas is characterized by the behavior of the largest lyapunov exponent as well as the characteristic distribution of the finite time lyapunov exponents .",

    "the formation of snas through heagy - hammel , fractalization , type - iii intermittency and crises induced intermittency are described in  @xcite .",

    "in addition to these , torus collision route to sna as well as fractalization route have been identified in  @xcite .      to start with",
    "we characterize periodic and chaotic attractors in eqs.(11 ) and ( 12 ) in the absence of quasiperiodic forcing . for this purpose",
    "the value of @xmath1 in eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) is randomly chosen in the interval ( 0,2@xmath17 ) , and the observable is @xmath72 .",
    "first , the periodic and chaotic behaviors are investigated in the logistic map by using the new coordinates of translation variables @xmath73 and @xmath74 . to analyze the behavior of the translation variables ,",

    "the aforementioned analysis clearly shows that the 0 - 1 test allows one to distinguish snas from quasiperiodic regime and chaos .",
    "a similar analysis has also distinguished tori , snas and chaotic attractors in the quasiperiodically forced cubic map represented by eq.(12 ) . for details , see appendix c. + we next study the characterization of different dynamical attractors as a function of the parameter @xmath62 in the quasiperiodically forced logistic map ( eq.11 ) in the parameter regime @xmath62 @xmath96 by using the 0 - 1 test .",
