    "( @xcite ) adjusted the dimensionless numbers ( reynolds , magnetic reynolds and peclet ) of the plasma in these experiments in appropriate regimes for astrophysics . a critical ingredient of these laboratory experiments is the significant thermal energy loss of both the jets and the ambient medium plasmas ; it plays a critical role in many astrophysical jet environments , e.g. ysos .",
    "the experimental setup of lebedev et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) consisted of a pair of concentric electrodes connected by a conical array of tungsten wires , of 13@xmath0 m in diameter , inside a vacuum chamber .",
    "a tw electrical pulse ( 1ma , 250ns ) was applied to this circuit .",
    "such current causes ablation of the wires which results in the formation of a background ambient plasma ( figure  1a ) .",
    "this material is pushed above the wires by lorentz forces then , while resistive diffusion keeps the current close to the wires .",
    "the current induces a toroidal magnetic field which at this stage is confined around the central electrode , below the wires . after the complete ablation of the section of the wires near the central electrode , the current switches to the plasma and creates a magnetic cavity ( figure  1b ) containing a central jet .",

    "( @xcite ) found that the body of the jets in their experiments was significantly affected by the development of instabilities ( figure  1e ) .",

    "we will now briefly describe the setup of our simulations , see huarte - espinosa et  al .",
    "( 2012b ) for a full description of the implementation .",
    "initially , the gas is static and has an ideal gas equation of state ( @xmath45@xmath53 ) , a number density of 100cms@xmath1 and a temperature of 10000k .",
    "the magnetic field is helical , centrally localized ( @xmath6 within @xmath7 ) and the magnetic pressure exceeds the thermal pressure inside the magnetized region .",
    "we use source terms to continually inject magnetic or kinetic energy at cells where @xmath7 .",
    "we have carried out six simulations : three pfd magnetic tower jets and three hydrodynamic jets .",
    "for each case we calculated an adiabatic , a cooling and a rotating case .",
    "the hydrodynamic runs were implemented is such as way as to have same time average propagation speed and energy flux as the adiabatic pfd jet run .",
    "we use the cooling tables of dalgarno & mccray  ( @xcite ) for the cooling case . for the rotating runs we applied a keplerian rotation profile to the gas and magnetic fields located within @xmath7 .",
    "our magnetic tower simulations consistently show that magnetic pressure gradients , alone , push field lines and plasma upward , forming magnetic cavities with low densities ( figure  2 , all but right panel ) .",
    "pfd jets decelerate relative to the hydro ones ; although both the pfd and the hydro jets have the same injected energy flux , the pfd case produces both axial and radial expansion due to magnetic pressure .",
    "+    r.73     +    the cores of the pdf jets are confined by magnetic hoop stress , while their surrounding cavities are collimated by external thermal pressure .",
    "in contrast , the pre - collimated hydro jets can only expand via a much lower thermal pressure .",
    "thus for our setup all of the energy flux in the hydro - case is more efficiently directed to axial mechanical power .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our hydro cases can emulate to some degree the asymptotic propagation regime of a jet that was magneto - centrifugally launched ( e.g. blackman 2007 ) which is distinct from a pfd jet .",
    "+ regarding the structure of the jets , we find that the pfd jet cores are thin and unstable , whereas the hydro jet beams are thicker , smoother and stable",
    ". these are observationally distinguishable features . the base rotation and the cooling conditions that we explore ( see end of section  [ model ] ) have mild effects on the propagation of the hydro jets , but strong effects on the stability of pfd jets .",
    "+ instabilities in our pdf jets are current driven ; the jets carry high axial currents which return along their outer contact discontinuity .",
    "lebedev et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) saw this current density distribution in their magnetic tower experiments .",
    "we find that the thermal to magnetic pressure ratio distribution , @xmath8 , consists of a central high beta plasma column the jets core surrounded by the low beta plasma of the cavities ( figure  3 ) .",
    "the growth rate of the current driven instabilities is accelerated by cooling , firstly , and by base rotation , secondly .",

    "these are logarithmic false gray - scale maps of the adiabatic ( left ) , the rotating ( middle ) and the cooling ( right ) jets.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    at the core of these jets the axial magnetic field dominates over the toroidal one .",
    "thus the columns instability condition is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the magnetic vacuum permeability , @xmath14 is the plasma thermal pressure and @xmath15 is the characteristic wavelength of the current - driven perturbations ( huarte - espinosa et  al . , 2012b ) .",
    "the cooling jet core consistently shows @xmath161 which means that because of thermal energy losses it does not have sufficient thermal energy to damp the toroidal magnetic pressure .",
    "hence kink perturbations grow exponentially .",
    "a different path to instability operates in the case in which we apply a keplerian rotation profile at the base of the pdf jet .",
    "rotation causes a slow amplification of the toroidal magnetic field , hence the left hand side of equation  ( [ insta ] ) increases slowly and so do the kink mode perturbations .",
    "the rotating jet is not completely destroyed by these perturbations , and their amplitude is about twice the radius of the central jet ( see huarte - espinosa et  al . , 2012b for details ) , in agreement with the kruskal - shafranov criterion ( kruskal et  al .",
    "@xcite ; shafranov  @xcite ) .      in figure  [ pfd ]",
    "we show logarithmic color maps of the distribution of the jet poynting to kinetic flux ratio @xmath17 as a function of time , where @xmath18_z \\ , ds , \\\\     f_k = & \\int\\limits_s   \\ , \\frac{1}{2 } \\ , \\rho \\ , |{\\bf v}|^2 \\ , v_z \\ , ds .",
    "\\end{array } \\label{fluxratio}\\ ] ] these integrals are taken over the area of the jets beam .",
    "we consistently see the core of the jets is dominated by kinetic energy flux ( @xmath191 , blue region ) , while the bulk of the beams is pfd ( @xmath201 , red region ) .",
    "such distribution is consistent with the one in the laboratory jets of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  [ exps ] ) .",

    "+    r.5    @xmath23 +   +    a very interesting result of our simulations is the long term evolution of pfd jets which yields a series of collimated clumps , the magnetization properties of which vary over time and distance from the engine .",
    "pfd flows may thus eventually evolve into hd jets at large distances from the central engine .",
    "a future avenue for this investigation is a comparison of the @xmath24 distribution between our magnetic towers where @xmath251 for the parameters explored and models of jets created by mcl processes ; while mcl jets begin with @xmath261 on scales less than the alfvn radius , in the asymptotic limit the kinetic energy flux comes to dominate the flux of electromagnetic energy leading .",
    "simulations of mcl launching in which the flow is cold and gas pressure can be ignored show typical values of @xmath270.7 at observationally - resolved distances from the engine ( krasnopolsky et al . 1999 , 2003 ) .",
    "changes in the distribution of @xmath24 are quite relevant for astrophysical jets .",
    "e.g. hartigan et al .",
    "2007 have shown that in yso , and perhaps in planetary nebulae jets as well , some mechanism may be needed to reduce the magnetization of plasma close to the jet source .",
    "if these flows began as magnetic towers then the disruption of the central jets via kink modes may provide a means to produce collimated high beta clumps of material as is observed in hh flows .",
    "our calculations are thus the fists steps towards distinguishing between different launch mechanisms by providing descriptions of asymptotic flow characteristics where observations might be possible , specially with the next generation of telescopes , e.g. alma .",
    "our magnetic tower jet simulations are in good agreement with the laboratory experiments of @xcite . in both investigations jets : ( 1 ) carry axial currents which return along the contact discontinuities , ( 2 ) the cores have a high @xmath28 plasma , ( 3 ) the beams and cavities are pfd , ( 4 ) are eventually corrugated by current driven instabilities becoming a collimated chain of magnetized `` clumps '' or `` bullets '' .",
    "we stress the similarity between our models and the laboratory experiments because our implementation was not tuned to represent the laboratory results at all .",
    "the laboratory experiments and the simulations support each other then , as well as the conclusion that both are revealing generic properties of pfd outflows .",
    "our simulations show that pfd jet beams are lighter , slower and less stable than pre - collimated asymptotically hydrodynamic jets .",
    "the latter might represent the asymptotic propagation regimes of magneto - centrifugally launched jets .",
    "we find current - driven perturbations in the pfd jets , which for the regimes studied are amplified by cooling , firstly , and by base rotation , secondly .",
    "this happens because shocks and thermal pressure support are weakened by cooling , making the jets more susceptible to kinking .",
    "base rotation , on the other hand , amplifies the toroidal magnetic field which in turn exacerbates the kink instability .",
    "eventually the instabilities cause the corrugation of the jets beam .",
    "pfd jets become a collimated chain of magnetized `` clumps '' or `` bullets '' then .",
