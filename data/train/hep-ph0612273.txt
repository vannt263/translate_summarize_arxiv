    "since supersymmetry ( susy ) is so appealing in particle physics , cosmology and string theory , its exploration will be a central focus of future collider experiments .",
    "if susy is at tev - scale , as required by solving the fine - tuning problem in particle physics , the lhc expects to discover it or at least reveal some of its fingerprints and then the ilc @xcite will zero in on its precision test and map out its detailed structure . however , if the fine - tuning in particle physics works in nature , just like the fine - tuning for the cosmological constant , susy may turn out to be a kind of split - susy @xcite , in which all scalar supersymmetric particles ( sfermions and additional higgs bosons ) are superheavy and only gauginos and higgsinos are possibly light and accessible at foreseeable colliders like the lhc and ilc .",
    "so , if split - susy is the true story , the focus of experimental and theoretical studies on susy will be gauginos and higgsinos .    to facilitate the collider searches for gauginos and higgsinos in split - susy , it is important to examine the possible range of their masses by considering various direct and indirect constraints and requirements .",
    "the lightness of gauginos and higgsinos is required by the consideration of the unification of gauge couplings and the explanation of cosmic dark matter .",
    "it turns out that the gauge coupling unification does not require gauginos or higgsinos necessarily below tev scale and they may be as heavy as 10 tev @xcite .",
    "however , the cosmic dark matter measured by wmap imposes much stronger constraints on the masses of gauginos and higgsinos ( except gluinos ) , whose lightest mass eigenstates , i.e. , the lightest neutralino and chargino , must be lighter than about 1 tev under the popular assumption @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 being the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gaugino masses , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that unlike the neutralinos and charginos , the gluino is not directly subject to the dark matter constraints and its mass constrained by gauge coupling unification can be as high as 18 tev @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the gluino is usually speculated to be much heavier than neutralinos and charginos .",
    "so , although the gluino is the only colored particle among gauginos and higgsinos and usually expected to be copiously produced in the gluon - rich environment of the lhc @xcite , it may be quite heavy and thus out of the reach of the lhc and ilc . therefore , to explore split - susy , it is important to examine the neutralinos and charginos .",
    "the neutralinos and charginos in split - susy constrained by the cosmic dark matter can be explored at the lhc and ilc in two ways .",
    "one way is directly looking for their productions , such as chargino pair productions .",
    "our previous analysis @xcite showed that the chargino pair production rates at the lhc and ilc are quite large in some part of the wmap - allowed parameter space , but in the remained part of the parameter space the production rates are unobservably small . the other way to reveal the existence of these particles",
    "is through disentangling their virtual effects in some processes which can be precisely measured .",
    "it is shown that susy may have sizable virtual effects in higgs boson processes @xcite and top quark processes @xcite since they are the heaviest particles in the sm and sensitive to new physics . for split - susy ,",
    "its virtual effects in top quark interactions and higgs - fermion yukawa interactions are expected to be small since the relevant vertex loops always involve sfermions which are superheavy .",
    "so , to reveal the virtual effects of split - susy , we concentrate on the gauge interactions of the higgs boson .",
    "such virtual effects of weakly interacting neutralinos and charginos are usually at percent level and only the high - luminosity @xmath8 collider like the ilc can possibly have such percent - level sensitivity . as the discovery machine , the lhc , however , is not expected to be able to disentangle such percent - level quantum effects due to its messy hadron backgrounds .",
    "so in this work we investigate the virtual effects of the wmap - allowed split - susy in higgs productions @xmath0 and @xmath1 through @xmath2 fusion at the ilc . note",
    "that although the susy corrections to these processes were calculated in the literature @xcite , our studies in this work are still necessary since those calculations were performed in the framework of the general minimal supersymmetric model and did not consider the dark matter constraints .",
    "this work is organized in the follows . in sec .",
    "ii we calculate the split - susy loop contributions to higgs production @xmath0 and @xmath1 through @xmath2 fusion at the ilc . in sec .",
    "iii we present some numerical results for the parameter space under wmap dark matter constraints .",
    "the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "iv . note that for the susy parameters we adopt the notations in @xcite .",
    "we assume the lightest supersymmetric particle is the lightest neutralino , which solely makes up the cosmic dark matter .",
    "in split - susy the higgs sector at low energy is fine - tuned to have only one higgs doublet @xcite and the effective spectrum of superparticles contains the higgsinos @xmath9 , winos @xmath10 , bino @xmath11 and gluino @xmath12 .",
    "the most genenral renormalizable lagrangian at low energy ( say tev scale ) contains the interactions @xmath13 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 .",
    "thus the higgs sector in split - susy is same as in the sm except for the additional higgs couplings to gauginos and higgsinos .",
    "other four higgs bosons in the mssm are superheavy and decouple .",
    "as is well known , an upper bound of about 135 gev exists for the lightest higgs boson in the mssm @xcite , which is relaxed to about 150 gev in split - susy @xcite .    the gauginos ( winos and bino ) and higgsinos mix into the mass eigenstates called charginos and neutralinos .",
    "the chargino mass matrix is given by @xmath15 and the neutralino mass matrix is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the weak mixing angle , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 defined by @xmath23 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the @xmath24 and @xmath25 gaugino mass parameters , and @xmath26 is the mass parameter in the mixing term @xmath27 in the superpotential .",
    "the diagonalization of ( [ mass1 ] ) gives two charginos @xmath28 with the convention @xmath29 ; while the diagonalization of ( [ mass2 ] ) gives four neutralinos @xmath30 with the convention @xmath31 .",
    "so the masses and mixings of charginos and neutralinos are determined by four parameters : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath26 and @xmath32 .",
    "note that the low energy lagrangian in eq.([lagran ] ) should be understood as an effective theory after squarks , sleptons , and heavier higgs bosons are integrated out .",
    "then , as is discussed in @xcite , the higgs - higgsino - gaugino couplings in eq.([lagran ] ) should deviate from the susy results shown in the off - diagonal elements of the mass matrices in eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) , although such deviation is negligible for numerical results .    in split",
    "susy the possible channels of higgs ( @xmath33 ) productions at the ilc are the higgs - strahlung process @xmath34 and @xmath2-fusion process @xmath1 .",
    "both processes will be precisely measured at the ilc if the light higgs boson @xmath33 is indeed found at the lhc . since these processes may be sensitive to new physics , they may serve as a good probe for tev - scale new physics .",
    "other channels , such as the production of @xmath33 associated with a cp - odd higgs boson @xmath35 and the charged higgs pair production , can not occur due to the superheavy @xmath35 and the superheavy charged higgs bosons .      the tree - level @xmath0 process is shown in fig .",
    "[ eezh - tree ] .",
    "for the one - loop effects of split susy , we need to calculate the diagrams containing the effective @xmath36-boson propagator and several effective vertices shown in fig .",
    "[ eezh - loop1 ] .",
    "note that the box diagrams always involve sfermions in the loops and thus drop out since all sfermions are superheavy in split susy . in our calculations we use the on - shell renormalization scheme @xcite . for each effective vertex or @xmath36-boson propagator",
    ", we need to calculate several loops plus the corresponding counterterms . for the new rare vertices induced at loop level , such as @xmath37 ,",
    "there are no corresponding counterterms .",
    "since in split - susy all scalar superparticles are superheavy and decouple from this process , the loops only involve charginos and neutralinos , as shown in fig .",
    "[ eezh - loop2 ] .    for the @xmath2-fusion process",
    "@xmath1 our calculations are similar as for @xmath0 .",
    "the tree - level feynman diagram is shown in fig .",

    "[ eezh - loop2 ] , each effective vertex or @xmath38-boson propagator contains several loops plus the corresponding counterterms , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ww - loop2 ] .    note that for @xmath1 , in addition to the @xmath2-fusion contribution shown in fig .",
    "[ ww - tree ] , another contribution comes from higgs - strahlung process @xmath0 followed by @xmath39 .",
    "the cross section of @xmath40 peaks at the threshold of @xmath41 and then falls rapidly as @xmath42 increases , where @xmath43 is the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy of @xmath8 collision .",
    "by contrast , the cross section of @xmath2-fusion process grows monotonously as @xmath42 increases and is far dominant over @xmath40 for @xmath44 . in our calculation",
    "we assume @xmath45 tev ( @xmath46 ) and thus we only consider @xmath2-fusion process .",
    "note that in the literature @xcite the supersymmetric corrections to this @xmath2-fusion process have been computed , but those calculations focus on the loops involving sfermions ( squarks and sleptons ) . in our calculations in the scenario of split - susy , we consider the loops involving charginos and neutralinos , ignoring the loops involving sfermions since all sfermions are superheavy in split - susy .",
    "so far in the literature such chargino / neutralino loop corrections have not been reported .",
    "each loop diagram is composed of scalar loop functions @xcite which are calculated by using looptools @xcite .",
    "the calculations of the loop diagrams are tedious and the analytical expressions are lengthy , which are not presented here .",
    "in split - susy the masses of squarks and the cp - odd higgs boson @xmath35 are assumed to be arbitrarily superheavy .",
    "as our previous study showed @xcite , their effects in low energy processes will decouple as long as they are heavier than about 10 tev .",
    "the higgs mass @xmath47 can be calculated from feynhiggs @xcite and in our calculations we assume the masses of squarks and higgs boson @xmath35 are 200 tev . among the low - energy parameters of split - susy , i.e. , @xmath32 , @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath26 , @xmath47 is sensitive to @xmath32 and a large @xmath32 leads to a large @xmath47 . in our calculations we fix @xmath48 since a large value of @xmath32 is favored by current experiments .",
    "our results are not sensitive to @xmath32 in the region of large @xmath32 value and our results are approximately valid for @xmath49 . with the input values of @xmath32 and squark masses ,",
    "we get @xmath50 gev from feynhiggs @xcite .    with the fixed value of @xmath32",
    ", there remained three split - susy parameters : @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath26 .",
    "we further use the unification relation @xmath51 , which is predicted in the minimal supergravity model .",
    "thus finally we have two free susy parameters .",
    "the sm parameters used in our results are taken from @xcite .      in order to show the features of our results",
    ", we first present some results without considering the wmap dark matter constraints . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the relative one - loop correction of split - susy to the cross section of @xmath0 versus the c.m .",
    "energy of @xmath8 collision for @xmath52 gev and @xmath53 gev . in this case the lightest chargino mass @xmath54 gev .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] that the corrections are negative and have a peak at @xmath55 due to the threshold effects .",
    "the magnitude of the corrections for @xmath56 tev , which will be taken for our following studies , is relatively small .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we fix @xmath56 tev and @xmath57 tev ( note that the scenario with a very large @xmath26 is proposed and argued in @xcite ) , and by varying @xmath7 we show the relative one - loop correction of split - susy to the cross section of @xmath0 versus the lightest chargino mass @xmath58 ( in this case the chargino mass @xmath59 is almost equal to @xmath7 due to the superheavy higgsinos ) .",
    "the peak happens at @xmath60 due to threshold effects .",
    "when the chargino mass gets heavier than 1 tev , the corrections becomes very small , showing the decoupling property .",
    "now we require the lightest neutralinos make up the cosmic dark matter relic density measured by wmap , which is given by @xmath61 at @xmath62 @xcite with @xmath63 being the hubble constant .",
    "of course , the direct bounds from lep experiments @xcite need to be also considered , which are : ( i ) the lightest chargino heavier than about 103 gev ; ( ii ) the lightest neutralino heavier than about 47 gev ; ( iii ) @xmath32 larger than 2 .",
    "note that the lep bound @xmath64 is obtained from the search limit of the lightest higgs boson for squarks below 1 tev .",
    "such a bound may be relaxed in split - susy because of superheavy squarks .",
    "we then perform a scan over the parameter space of @xmath7 and @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath62 allowed region is shown in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "( note that in @xcite we used the one - year wmap data @xmath65 .",
    "the allowed region with one - year wmap data is approximately same as that with three - year wmap data ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we show the one - loop correction of split - susy to the cross section of @xmath0 ( lower panel ) with comparison to the chargino pair production rate ( upper panel ) .",
    "the chargino pair production rate is calculated at tree - level , as in our previous work @xcite .    from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we see that when the chargino is lighter than about 300 gev , the chargino pair production rate at the ilc is large and the corresponding virtual effects in @xmath0 are positive .",
    "when the chargino gets heavier , the chargino pair production rate at the ilc drops rapidly . of course , when the chargino is heavier than 500 gev , beyond the threshold of the ilc ( with c.m .",
    "energy of 1 tev ) , the charginos can not be pair produced .",
    "then it is interesting to observe that for a chargino between 500 and 600 gev , although the ilc can not produce chargino pairs , the virtual effects in @xmath0 can still reach a couple of percent in magnitude and thus may be observable at the ilc with a high integrated luminosity . finally ,",
    "when the chargino is heavier than about 600 gev , it will probably remain unaccessible because both the chargino pair production rates and the virtual effects are very small due to the decoupling property of susy .",
    "note that for @xmath0 we numerically compared our results with the full one - loop corrections given in @xcite ( we thank the authors of @xcite for giving us their fortran code ) . in our calculations",
    "we only considered the chargino and neutralino loops , while in their calculations the sfermion loops are also considered besides the chargino and neutralino loops . in principle , their results in the limit of superheavy sfermions should approach to our results .",
    "we found that although their fortran code does not work well for superheavy sfermions ( say above 10 tev ) due to the limitation of numerical calculation , for a given point in the parameter space our results agree well with those by using their fortran code with all sfermions above 1 tev .",
    "the one - loop correction of split - susy to the cross section of @xmath2-fusion process @xmath1 is very small in magnitude , below one percent , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "even with a high luminosity the ilc can hardly reveal such a small deviation from the measurement of this process .",
    "the reason why the virtual effects in the @xmath66-channel process @xmath0 is much larger in magnitude than in the @xmath67-channel process @xmath68 may be that for the @xmath66-channel process the virtual sparticles ( charginos and neutralinos ) in the loops could be more energetic and cause larger quantum effects .",
    "anyway , such virtual effects of split - susy , no matter large or small in magnitude , could be informative and complementary to the real sparticle productions in probing split - susy at colliders .",
    "for example , if split - susy turns out to be the true story and the chargino pair production is observed with the chargino mass around 150 gev at the ilc , then we know from figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] that the virtual effects of susy must be about @xmath69 for process @xmath0 and @xmath70 for @xmath2-fusion process @xmath1 .",
    "in split supersymmetry , gauginos and higgsinos are the only supersymmetric particles possibly accessible at foreseeable colliders like the lhc and the ilc . in order to account for the cosmic dark matter measuerd by wmap ,",
    "the parameter space of the gauginos and higgsinos in split supersymmetry are stringently constrained , which can be explored at the lhc and the ilc through direct productions and the virtual effects of these gauginos and higgsinos .",
    "the clean environment of the ilc may render the virtual effects of percent level meaningful in probing the new physics . in this work we assumed split supersymmetry and calculated the virtual effects of the wmap - allowed gauginos and higgsinos in higgs productions @xmath0 and @xmath1 through @xmath2 fusion at the ilc .",
    "we found that the production cross section of @xmath3 can be altered by a few percent in some part of the wmap - allowed parameter space , while the correction to the @xmath2 fusion process @xmath1 is below @xmath4 .",
    "such virtual effects are correlated with the cross sections of chargino pair productions and thus can offer complementary information in probing split supersymmetry at the colliders .",
    "our results indicate that if the lightest chargino is in the light region allowed by the wmap dark matter ( say below 200 gev ) , then at the ilc and lhc the chargino pair production rates are large and the virtual effects of charginos / neutralinos in the process @xmath0 at the ilc can reach a few percent , both of which may be measurable and cross - checked .",
    "an interesting observation is that for a chargino between 500 and 600 gev , although the ilc ( with c.m . energy of 1 tev ) can not produce chargino pairs , the virtual effects in @xmath0 can still reach a couple of percent in magnitude and thus may be observable at the ilc with a high integrated luminosity .",
    "the wmap - allowed region with the chargino heavier than about 600 gev will most likely remain unaccessible because both the chargino production rates and the virtual effects are very small due to the decoupling property of susy .",
