    "as quoted by nelkin @xcite , vorticity is intrinsically a non - local quantity , and therefore it can hardly be measured by using local probes ( e.g. hot wire anemometers ) @xcite .",
    "although vorticity could `` conceptually '' be measured by local probes , the main problem resides in that one needs at least two probes , separated by a finite distance in order to compute the gradients involved by the curl operator . from an experimental point of view",
    "the situation is even worse : at least nine probes are needed to reconstruct the three components of the vorticity , within the appropriate taylor hypothesis ( see @xcite ) . since these probes have a finite extension and finite time response , the computation of the gradients at the smallest scale of the turbulent flow becomes problematic @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing here that an alternate experimental has been proposed by noullez & al .",
    "@xcite in order to probe directly the spatial transverse velocity increments in a turbulent flow .",
    "+ taking these latter remarks into account , one can find several theoretical @xcite , experimental @xcite and numerical works @xcite addressing the direct measurement of the vorticity field using acoustic scattering .",
    "as in any scattering experiment , one expects to be sensitive to the spatial fourier distribution of the scatterers ( as the amplitude of the scattered wave is expressed in terms of some coherent average on `` secondary sources '' ) over a finite volume defined as being the cross section of the acoustic beams ( incident and scattered ) . in a recent paper , lund _",
    "@xcite derive a linear relation between the fourier transform of the scattered ultrasound amplitude and the space - time fourier transform of the vorticity field .",
    "in analogy with the more usual light scattering phenomenon , the physical mechanism at the origin of acoustic scattering by vorticity can be thought of as follows  : an acoustic wave impinging on a vorticity distribution induces fluctuations of the vorticity at the incoming sound frequency ( by virtue of the kelvin circulation theorem ) .",
    "each scatterer ( vortex ) acting as a secondary source will , in turn , radiate a sound wave .",
    "the coherent average ( taking into account the relative positions of the individual vorticity elements ) over the scatterers distribution results in the emission , outside the vorticity domain , of a scattered acoustic wave .",
    "it is important to emphasize here that many vortices interact simultaneously with the wave front .",
    "such interactions have been numerically investigated in @xcite in the case where a unique vortex is present . in a scattering process ,",
    "one is sensitive to spatial details of the scatterers distribution at a typical length scale measured by the wavelength .",
    "note that whereas a light scattering process is usually linear , the acoustic scattering phenomenon depicted here stems from the non - linear term of the navier - stokes equation , and requires much explanations and details computations that are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in particular , one can find in @xcite a clear explanation of the respective contributions to the acoustic scattering cross - section of the vorticity field on one hand , and of the irrotational velocity field , induced by the vorticity , on the other .",
    "+ using a born approximation , lund _",

    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the unit vectors in the direction of the probing and detected sound waves    it is important to emphasize here that among the hypothesis used in @xcite the characteristic time of any process within the flow has to be very large compared with the period of the analyzing sound wave .",
    "this latter remark implies that @xmath16 and that this method is relevant only for flows with low mach number .",
    "equation ( [ eqn_diff ] ) shows that , using acoustic scattering , it is possible to probe one component ( perpendicular to the scattering plane defined by the vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) at a chosen length scale through the selection of a known scattering wave vector @xmath6 .",
    "+ in a previous similar experiment @xcite ( see also @xcite ) performed on the regular vortex street behind a cylinder at low reynolds numbers , we have demonstrated that the scattering cross section is indeed strongly dependent on the direction of the vorticity field accordingly to equation ( 1 ) of the present paper .",
    "this latter experiment evidences the existence of direct interactions between vorticity and acoustic waves  : among the nine components of the stress tensor only one vector can be defined without ambiguity , i.e. the vorticity ( antisymmetric part of the tensor ) .",
    "furthermore , a nice feature of this method lies in the fact that it is a non perturbating technique .",
    "the acoustic waves are produced and detected by sell - type transducers ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the dimensions of which are 15 cm x 15 cm . the advantage of dealing with such large transducers is to minimize diffraction effects and therefore to enable a sharp selectivity of the scattering wave vectors ( @xmath6 defined above ) , both in modulus and direction @xcite . as shown on figure",
    "( [ setup ] ) , the direction of @xmath6 is aligned with the mean - flow velocity   in order to maximize the doppler shift .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath6 , and thus the probed length - scale in the flow , is then selected by tuning the incoming sound frequency @xmath9 , the scattering angle being held fixed . indeed , for practical purposes , it is much simpler to hold the geometry of the experimental setup constant . therefore , @xmath11 is constant and @xmath6 has constant direction .",
    "the scattering angle @xmath11 was set to 60 degrees , as a trade - off between optimizing the sensitivity of the measurements and limiting the spurious effects induced by diffraction side - lobes @xcite .",
    "it can then be seen from ( [ eqn_diff ] ) , that the fourier transform ( ft ) of the scattered pressure signal is proportional to the band - pass spatial frequency filtered vorticity field .",
    "the central frequency of the latter filter is @xmath17 .",
    "its width ( @xmath18 ) can be obtained from the diffraction pattern of the sell transducers @xcite . a rough estimate of @xmath18 is given by differentiating @xmath6 with respect to @xmath11 , which leads to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is given by a diffraction ansatz : @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the characteristic size of the transducer @xcite .",
    "the volume which is analyzed is defined by the cross section of the incident beam and the main lobe of the receiver ( antenna beam ) .",
    "its dimensions in our experimental setup were of the same order of magnitude ( a bit larger ) than the transducers dimensions .",
    "+ the flow which we investigate in this paper , consists in an axi - symmetric turbulent jet flow ( @xmath23 ) . emerging from a circular nozzle of diameter 5 cm , at a high velocity ( about 60 ms@xmath24 ) .",
    "details about our wind tunnel facility can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the volume of interest was set at a distance of about 50 nozzle diameters downstream ensuring that the turbulence is fully developed .",
    "a study based on classical anemometry ( performed in the same area of interest ) leads to the estimated following parameters  : the average longitudinal velocity is about 5.3 ms@xmath24 and the turbulence ratio is about 28% @xcite .",
    "the third order structure function exhibits a clear power law scaling over 1.5 decades ( from the taylor scale @xmath25 mm up to the integral length scale @xmath26 m ) , with an exponent close to 1 in accordance to the kolmogorov four - fifths law @xcite . from this inertial range scaling",
    ", we deduce the value of the mean energy dissipation per unit mass @xmath27 m@xmath28s@xmath29 , the kolmogorov micro scale @xmath30 @xmath31 m and the large eddy turnover time @xmath32 ms .",
    "the analyzing sound frequency can be varied from 5khz up to 200khz ( where sound attenuation effects can not be neglected ) .",
    "thus we are able to probe a large part of the inertial range , as well as length scales belonging to the beginning of the dissipation range @xcite .",
    "however in this paper , we shall restrict our analysis to a single length scale pertaining to the inertial range ( @xmath33 cm@xmath24 corresponding to a typical length scale of 1.7 cm ) .",
    "an experiment consists in measuring and recording time series of the acoustic pressure signal received on a sell - type transducer ( see above ) .",
    "the emitted sound wave can be considered as being a monochromatic plane wave ( if diffraction effects are neglected at first sight ) .",
    "the sampling device ( hp3565 ) has 16 bit resolution and its sampling frequency is 262144 hz . each recording channel is provided with its own local oscillator ( tuned at @xmath35 ) , thus enabling a numerical heterodyne detection of the scattered signal around the frequency of the impinging sound wave .",
    "note also that , in order to reduce phase noise along the whole measurement line , the waveform generators ( sound emission ) , the sampling clock and the local oscillators ( demodulation ) are locked on the same 10 mhz master clock .",
    "two time series associated with synchronous phase and quadrature signals are recorded at a rate of 8192 samples per second , from which the analytical complex signal is computed ( characterized by a phase and an amplitude ) .",
    "indeed , thanks to the linearity of our ultrasonic detectors , the phase information of the scattered pressure wave is preserved ( the phase reference being that of the incoming sound wave ) . + as indicated by equation ( [ eqn_diff ] ) ( expressing a convolution in the time fourier domain ) , the scattered pressure signal is obtained as a time modulation of the incoming pressure signal ( carrier wave ) by the low frequency signal associated with the vorticity of the flow under investigation ( for small enough mach numbers ) .",
    "one thus expects a narrow band scattered signal with frequencies close to the incoming sound frequency @xmath9 ( see figure [ spec_fig ] a ) .",
    "then , the purpose of the above mentioned heterodyne detection is to significantly reduce the amount of stored data . equations ( [ eqn_diff],[q_scat ] ) lead ( for @xmath16 ) to express the fourier transform of the detected pressure signal as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 stand for the magnitude of the scattering wave - vector and the vorticity component orthogonal to the scattering plane , respectively",
    ". we have represented on figure [ spec_fig ] ( a ) a typical averaged power spectral density of the scattered pressure signal ( after demodulation ) obtained in the turbulent jet flow .",
    "notice that in this figure and throughout this paper , the frequency axis represents the frequency shift with respect to the incoming sound frequency @xmath35 .",
    "the spectrum is clearly non - symmetric with respect to the null frequency .",
    "this latter fact is a simple consequence of the advection of the vorticity field by the flow velocity and to our decision to align the scattering wave vector with the direction of the mean flow velocity @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , the scattering of waves by a moving structure gives rise to a frequency shift @xmath40 as a consequence of a doppler effect @xcite : @xmath41 notice that this latter relation can be obtained by applying a galilean transform in the real space followed by a double fourier transform on the space and time variables .",
    "+ from ( [ eqn_diff2 ] ) one expects a divergence of the scattered signal around @xmath42 , for which @xmath43 and thus @xmath44 .",
    "indeed , the existence of direct paths between the emitter and receiver ( associated to diffraction effects due to the finite size of the transducers ) results in the presence of a very strong peak in the spectrum @xmath45 around @xmath44 . from ( [ doppler ] ) , we are able to relate @xmath37 to @xmath40 , and thus get the following expression for the received acoustic signal @xmath46 bearing in mind that the scattered pressure signal is recorded after a numerical heterodyning procedure that shifts its analytical frequency spectrum around the null frequency ( the frequency of local oscillator in the lock - in is set to @xmath35 ) , one gets @xmath47 where @xmath48 stand for the scattered pressure recorded signal . taking the inverse ft of equation ( [ eqn_diff4 ] ) leads to @xmath49 the preceding equation expresses the recorded scattered signal ( after heterodyning ) as being the integral of @xmath50 with respect to the time variable as a consequence , the recorded data must be differentiated to give a correct representation of @xmath50 .",
    "it is important to notice here that the latter differentiation must be performed at a low frequency , since the heterodyne detection has already been applied .",
    "the averaged power density spectrum ( pds ) of @xmath51 recorded for the jet flow ( see preceding section ) and @xmath52 , is shown on figure ( [ spec_fig ] a ) .",
    "figure ( [ spec_fig ] b ) illustrates the efficiency of the difference filter applied to the time series for extracting a pds proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "it is worth noticing at this point that this differentiation ansatz is nothing else than a transposition of the taylor hypothesis ( heavily used in single point measurement ) .",
    "actually , it suffers from the same limitations with regards to the level of turbulence.however , as explained below , these limitations can be overcome by the resort to the time - frequency distributions .      according to ( [ q_scat ] ) ,",
    "a given spatial spectral component of the vorticity field may be probed by using different sets @xmath54 , associated with a couple of transducers ( one emitter , one receiver ) which will be referred to as a _ channel _ in the rest of the paper .",
    "the acoustical paths corresponding to the null scattering angle for which divergence occurs ( thus explaining the presence of a strong peak at zero frequency shift , see ( [ doppler ] ) ) is then different for each set of ultrasonic emitter - receiver . as a consequence",
    ", it is expected that the parts of the signals corresponding to the null scattering angle , recorded on each channel are mutually non coherent .",
    "following the same reasoning , it is expected to find a high degree of coherence between parts of signals that are due to scattering effects from the same measurement area ( cf preceding sections ) , provided that both channels are tuned to probe the same scattering wave - vector : @xmath55 where @xmath56 stands for the ultrasound frequency and scattering angle associated with channel @xmath57 .",
    "the additional hypothesis in the 2-channel measurement scheme , is that the measurement areas defined by the 2 sets of transducers are actually identical .",
    "this point is crucial in our experiment , as any mismatch in the measurement areas would preclude any possibility to compare scattering signals , which would then be associated to different spatial distributions .",
    "the setting of the experiment is derived by carefully aligning the transducers with laser diode rays .",
    "then , the lengths of the acoustical paths for each channels are set to the same value ( up to a precision of 1 mm ) , i.e. much smaller that the sampling period . ] , in order to insure equivalent propagations delays on both channels . this is achieved by checking the phase of the cross channels inter - spectrum estimates , and shifting the transducers along its main diffraction axis accordingly : for null propagation delay , the slope of the phase with respect to frequency must be zero , as group delays are expected to be identical on both channels .",
    "+ figure ( [ figcoh ] ) illustrates the fact that the divergences at zero - frequency shifts , measured on two channels verifying ( [ tuning ] ) are mutually non coherent , whereas the part of the spectrum corresponding to the scattered waves from the same measurement area ( doppler shifted ) are highly similar ( high cross - coherence values ) .",
    "furthermore , the values obtained for the cross - coherence do not depend on whether the differentiation ( see preceding paragraph ) was performed , as the same linear filter ( time differentiation ) is applied to both channels .",
    "this latter observation illustrates the pertinence of the differentiation for extracting the interesting part ( i.e. the signature of the vorticity ) in the recorded signal .",
    "the phase of the cross - channels inter - spectrum is shown on the last plot of figure ( [ figcoh ] ) : one sees that the phase slope takes low values within the frequency domain where the spectrum of scattered signals is significant . + so far",
    ", we have dealt with second order statistical properties of the turbulent flow , and considered long enough records , to insure that the stationary hypothesis was correctly met . however , the spectrum of the recorded time - series corresponding to one spatial frequency component of the vorticity field , turns out to have an important width ( equivalent 10db bandwidth= 400hz ) .",
    "this may be ascribed to either fluctuations of the advection velocity ( thus leading to fluctuations of the doppler shift ) , or to finite duration of vorticity structures . in this latter case ,",
    "one then expects to record \" sine - wave trains of finite duration .",
    "notice that both effects are likely to occur simultaneously .",
    "therefore , one is naturally led to look for an analyzing tool allowing a joint representation in time ( in order to access `` vortex life time '' ) and frequency ( for evidencing doppler shifts , or equivalently , advection velocity fluctuations ) .",
    "when finite duration events of vorticity are present , the scattered acoustic signal will exhibit a time - varying spectrum , as the frequency of the measured pressure signal drops from @xmath58 to @xmath59 when a vorticity event exists , that has energy in the spatial fourier domain at the wave - vector @xmath6 . due to the randomness of the velocity field which advects the vorticity field , the finer details of the time dynamics of individual events",
    "are wiped out when average spectra of the scattered signals are computed .",
    "indeed , on the average , the scattered spectrum has a gaussian shape reflecting the statistical properties of the flow velocity @xcite .",
    "notice that an infinitely thin and localized vortex ( theoretical ) would have contributions at all wave - vectors in the spatial fourier domain .",
    "our aim is thus twofold  : first , detecting presence / absence of such events in the recorded signal , and second , estimating the frequency shift @xmath40 at which this occurs , in order to characterize its relative velocity .",
    "we are thus faced with the need for a representation of the signal which preserve simultaneously the time and frequency information .",
    "+ temporal fluctuations of the spectral distribution can be approached by the common spectrogram analysis .",
    "watkins @xcite , among others , has addressed this problem and provides examples of reasonable and unreasonable spectrogram results in the analysis of bio - acoustics signals ( marine mammal sounds ) .",
    "however , the spectrogram involves a sliding time window which intends to capture a portion of the signal which is sufficiently restricted in time so that stationarity assumptions are approximately met .",
    "furthermore , the presence of the window results in a time - frequency distribution ( tfd ) exhibiting both temporal and spectral leakage . + the wigner - ville distribution ( wvd ) avoids the problems of windowing the signal but the presence of interference terms between signal components , due to the quadratic nature of the wvd ( see next paragraph ) @xcite often precludes its applicability .",
    "recent studies have shown that a class of smoothed wvd , the cohen s class of tfds , allows to reduce the amplitude of the interference terms , while preserving covariance properties of the wvd in both the time and frequency domains .",
    "cohen @xcite and flandrin @xcite have recently provided excellent reviews of tf analysis , including recent developments .",
    "it is worth noticing here that the above mentioned signal representations do not rule out the gabor - heinsenberg inequalities ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a brief presentation of the main issues on cohen s class tf analysis and the key role played by the ambiguity function is given below .",
    "+ in this paper , we focus on one distribution from the cohen s class , the reduced - interference distribution ( rid ) .",
    "it was first introduced by choi and williams @xcite , and has the additional feature of preserving the time and frequency support of signal components  : ( @xmath60 is non zero if the signal is non zero at @xmath61 and has a spectral component at @xmath62 ) .",
    "these are highly desirable properties if one wishes to infer statistical properties of the vorticity distributions from this tf analysis .",
    "the examples shown were computed with a binomial rid , which is a good discrete approximation of the continuous distribution @xcite .",
    "the wigner - ville distribution of @xmath63 is defined as the fourier transform ( f ) of @xmath64 with respect to the lag variable @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66=f_{\\tau}[r_z(t,\\tau ) ] \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the time signal , @xmath67 is its complex conjugate .",
    "the operator @xmath68 denotes the fourier transform operator , with respect to the variable @xmath69 ; this notation will be adopted in the rest of that paper . from an experimental and heuristic point of view",
    ", the effect of the operator @xmath70 is equivalent to a local phase conjugation of the signal which enhances the phase derivative related to the doppler shift ( p. flandrin : private communication ) .",
    "similarly , but a with different physical meaning , the symmetrical , with respect to @xmath61 .",
    "the symmetric af used here is defined as the inverse ft of @xmath70 , with respect to @xmath61 .",
    "this does not induce any change in the interpretation of the af ( see @xcite ) , and is only a matter of convention .",
    "however , it allows to relate the af to the wvd via a two - dimensional ft with respect to @xmath61 and @xmath65 ( see equation [ wvd - af ] ) . ]",
    "ambiguity function ( af ) is defined as the inverse fourier transform ( @xmath71 ) of @xmath70 with respect to the first variable is set to zero .",

    "similarly , application of the kernel in the tf domain involves convolution in time and frequency in cohen s class of distributions .",
    "conventional filtering concepts can be adapted to reduced interference distribution ( rid ) design .",
    "new distributions with reduced interference ( rids ) @xcite have been developed in recent years , serving as attractive alternates for the spectrogram and the wvd .",
    "the rid represents an attempt to preserve most of the desirable features of the wvd while alleviating most of the confusing interference between signal components .",

    "preservation of the time and frequency marginals is one of the important properties of rids .",
    "one can recover the energy spectrum ( by integrating with respect to time ) or the instantaneous power ( by integrating with respect to frequency ) .",
    "this is not the case for spectrograms and many other popular tf distributions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a nice discrete kernel which has a binomial form has been used in our applications .",
    "this kernel is computationally efficient and also exhibits desirable characteristics in terms of tf distributions @xcite .",

    "the binomial tfd is a good discrete time approximation of the continuous rid .",
    "the binomial tfd ( hereafter called the tf - rid ) was computed for acoustic signals obtained in the turbulence experiment depicted in the previous sections . + in the cases which are presented , two channels were used to probe the same measurement area  : the experimental setup is carefully arranged in such a way that the measurement areas defined by the intersection of the acoustic beams of each channel are actually superimposed .",

    "first and second channel had the following characteristics @xmath106 and @xmath107 . applying eq .",

    "+ the pertinence of both the tf - rid approach , and the length scale selection , within the context of these experiments is illustrated by the high similarity between the tf - rid obtained from the two different ( and independent ) measurement channels .",
    "both channels evidence the existence of time localized structures ( energy packets in the tf - rid ) at the same set of instants and with identical doppler shifts , which was to be expected as the probed wave vectors are very close to each other ( in modulus and direction ) and are defined within the same measurement volume ( cf figure ( [ setup ] ) ) .",
    "+ the interest of such tf - rid representation in the present context is thus threefold .",
    "first , it emphasizes the fact that the broadening of the averaged spectrum is due to both the short duration of the structure or events that are the origin of the scattering effects , and the fluctuations of the doppler shifts ( the center of mass of the energy packets in the tf - rid are not well aligned along an axis @xmath121 .",
    "second , such representation provides a straightforward way to detect the time of occurrence of events at a given scale .",
    "a systematic study of the statistical distributions of such events , as functions of the probed scale is presently a matter of great interest and will be presented in a future paper .",
    "third , the use of two simultaneous channel measurements allows one to test the existence of events at different wavelengths arbitrarily close to each other ( scale resolution ) . in the preceding example , the characteristics were set to probe two close scales ( namely @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) .",
    "structures that are evidenced on one channel clearly appear jointly in the second channel ; this latter point is illustrated on the central plot of figure ( [ fig20294 ] ) , where the normalized time marginal of the geometric mean of the rid of the channels , @xmath124 is shown : @xmath125 @xmath126 is the tf - rid of the signal recorded on channel @xmath57 , and @xmath127 is the normalized frequency . note that @xmath128 by virtue of cauchy - schwarz inequality . this method ( maximum likelihood criterion )",
    "allows detection of the joint presence of energy at a given time an d with a given doppler shift on both channels .",

    "the normalized co - occurrence function @xmath124 takes lower values than those obtained in the preceding case .",
    "furthermore , the number of co - occurrences that are detected is much lower in this case , compared to the co - occurrence detected when the tuning condition ( cf eq .",

    "it is worth noticing here that the measured correlation length remains smaller than the size of our transducers .",
    "it is interesting at this point to mention a few words about the spatial and spectral resolutions of the experimental setup .",
    "the spatial resolution is determined by the maximum frequency one is able to propagate through the flow of interest ; actually , this frequency is around @xmath151 enabling to probe lengthscales as small as @xmath152 @xcite ( this upper frequency limit is due to sound absorption phenomena ) . the spectral resolution , determining the minimum spatial wavevector separation one can probe , depends directly on the size @xmath22 of the transducers which fixed the width @xmath18 of the equivalent spatial filter @xcite ( @xmath153 see also section 2 ) .",
    "notice however , that the latter limitation ( analogous to the rayleigh criterion used in optics ) can be overcome by resorting to a deconvolution scheme once the diffraction pattern of each transducer has been modelized or characterized .",
    "we propose a method for evidencing coherent vorticity structures in turbulent flows .",
    "though this existence seems to be widely accepted and evidenced by numerical simulations @xcite or in some peculiar flows @xcite it still deserves further experimental efforts .",
    "furthermore , no clear definition seems to exist for coherent structures .",
    "the experimental technique described here is derived in the spatial fourier domain and recovers the intuitive notion of phase stationarity thus allowing one to understand these structures as propagating energy ( more precisely enstrophy ) packets .",
    "+ the main advantage of the acoustic technique relies on its global and non pertubative character , as it gives access to the instantaneous value of spatial fourier components of the vorticity field . + using two distinct channels ( acoustic interferometry ) we are able to establish the robustness ( noise immunity ) of our vorticity detection scheme .",
    "in addition , this configuration enables the simultaneous probing of two spatial wave vectors arbitrarily close to each other ( scale resolved spectroscopy ) .",
    "this latter remark is in contrast with usual one - point measurement ( hot wire anemometry ) in turbulence which do not allow a clear separation of time and space dynamics .",
    "indeed in such measurements , one has to use the taylor hypothesis in order to recast time increments into spatial increments .",
    "+ the joint resort to acoustic scattering and to time - frequency distributions leads to a measurement process whereby time ( date of occurrence ) and frequency ( doppler shifts ) informations are preserved ( time resolved spectroscopy ) .",
    "it is worth noticing here that this kind of analysis could be easily transposed to data obtained from numerical simulations .",
    "indeed , in the case of pseudo - spectral direct numerical simulations ( dns ) , a great part of the computing time is spent in the spatial fourier space .",
    "we claim that time - frequency distributions offer an efficient tool for the detection of coherent structures as it is a `` blind '' detection : no a priori information is needed ( for example on the shape of the structures ) and one only resorts to a stationary phase criterion ( stating that components of a coherent structure are convected with the same velocity ) . from the rid representations of the scattered signals ( simultaneously acquired ) ,",
    "we define a generalized time - scale correlation function based upon a maximum likehood criterion .",
    "this time - scale correlation function reveals salient features of the time - scale dynamics of the detected coherent structures .",
    "the most interesting one is the existence of a cascade process from larger scale towards smaller one , this process being continuous in time .",
