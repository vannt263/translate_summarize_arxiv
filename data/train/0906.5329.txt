    "by now it has been demonstrated that neutrinos can change flavour . experiments with solar , atmospheric",
    ", reactor and accelerator neutrinos have established that there is a nonzero probability that a neutrino created with a certain flavour is detected with a different one after having propagated for some distance , and that this probability is dependent on the propagated distance , @xmath3 , and the neutrino energy @xmath4 .    the standard mechanism that explains neutrino flavour transitions makes use of two different bases : the basis of neutrino mass eigenstates , which have well - defined masses , and the basis of neutrino interaction states -the flavour basis- which are the ones that take part in weak processes such as @xmath5 decay .",
    "the two bases are connected by means of a unitary transformation @xmath6 , so that we can write each of the flavour states @xmath7 as a linear combination of the mass eigenstates @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 where the coefficients @xmath10 are components of the unitary mixing matrix that represents the transformation . assuming the existence of three active neutrino families ( @xmath11 ) , as indicated by experiment @xcite , the summation index runs @xmath12 and @xmath6 is a @xmath13 matrix . using this definition for the flavour states it is straightforward to conclude that flavour transitions occur because neutrinos are massive , and because different mass eigenstates have different masses .",
    "this can be seen , within the three - neutrino formalism , by writing the transition probabilities from @xmath14 to @xmath15 as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the mass of the @xmath19-th eigenstate , and @xmath20 . clearly , if @xmath21 , no transitions occur .",
    "note the @xmath22 dependence on the energy associated with this standard , mass - driven , oscillation mechanism .",
    "the experiments that have studied neutrino flavour transitions @xcite have been designed to detect neutrinos with energies that range from a few mev ( solar neutrinos ) to the tev scale ( atmospheric neutrinos ) .",
    "the mass - driven mechanism mentioned in the preceding paragraph has been experimentally confirmed within this energy range .",
    "notably , data from the super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino experiment @xcite was used to find an energy dependence of the oscillation probability of @xmath23 , with @xmath24 at @xmath25 confidence level , thus confirming the dominance of the mass - driven mechanism in this energy range , and relegating any other possible mechanism due to new physics to subdominance .",
    "it is possible , however , that one or more of such subdominant mechanisms become important at higher energies .    in the present paper , we have explored a possible scenario where there is an extra oscillation mechanism present which results in an energy - independent contribution to neutrino oscillations .",
    "this mechanism , though subdominant in the mev - tev range , might become dominant at higher energies .",
    "we will deferr the detailed treatment of how the contribution is introduced to section [ section_theory ] and focus now on the possible mechanisms behind it .",
    "an energy - independent contribution to neutrino oscillations is introduced by a vector coupling of the form @xmath26 such a term results in an energy - independent oscillation phase @xmath27 , with the @xmath28 eigenvalues of the @xmath29 matrix , so that the phase in eq .",
    "( [ eqtransprob ] ) becomes @xmath30 and the mixing matrix @xmath6 is modified as well .",
    "specially relevant to the detection prospects of new physics is the fact that not only the oscillation phase -which , as we will see , is lost when considering neutrinos from distant astrophysical sources- , but also its amplitude , is modified by such an energy - independent contribution .    a vector coupling like that of eq .  ( [ eqlagrangian ] ) could be induced by violation of lorentz invariance which in turn results in a violation of cpt symmetry .",
    "a realisation of this possibility is the standard model extension @xcite , which includes cpt - odd terms in the lagrangian , such as that of eq .",
    "( [ eqlagrangian ] ) .",
    "a different possible mechanism is a nonuniversal coupling to a torsion field @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we will argue that a possible energy - independent contribution to flavour oscillations could become important , with respect to the standard oscillation terms , when the neutrino energy is high ( pev or more ) .",
    "the highest - energy available flux of neutrinos is the expected ultra - high - energy ( uhe ) flux from astrophysical sources -notably , active galaxies- which are located at distances in the order of tens or hundres of mpc . for these conditions , the flavour - transition probability in eq .",
    "( [ eqtransprob ] ) oscillates very rapidly , and so we are moved to use its average value instead , which is obtained by averaging the oscillating terms in the expression , i.e. @xmath31 thus the information in the oscillation phase is lost , but the modifications due to the energy - independent new physics is preserved in the elements of the mixing matrix .",

    "the mass eigenstates @xmath34 satisfy schrdinger s equation and so propagate as @xmath35 where we have assumed that @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 , and that , because neutrinos are highly relativistic particles , @xmath38 ( in natural units )",
    ". thus , after having propagated for a distance @xmath3 , the neutrino created with flavour @xmath39 has become @xmath40_{\\alpha i } e^{-i\\frac{m_i^2}{2e}l } \\lvert \\nu_i \\rangle ~.\\ ] ] we see that each mass eigenstate acquires a phase that depends on the value of its mass : the interference of these phases is the source of the flavour transitions . at detection ,",
    "the probability amplitude of seeing a @xmath15 is @xmath41_{\\alpha i}^\\ast \\left[u_0\\right]_{\\beta j } e^{-i\\frac{m_i^2}{2e}l } \\langle \\nu_j \\lvert \\nu_i \\rangle    = \\sum_i \\left[u_0\\right]_{\\alpha i}^\\ast \\left[u_0\\right]_{\\beta i } e^{-i\\frac{m_i^2}{2e}l}\\ ] ] and so the probability @xmath42 for the transition @xmath43 turns out to be eq .",
    "( [ eqtransprob ] ) .",
    "( the reader is referred to @xcite for a more extended treatment of the basics of neutrino oscillations . )    the oscillation hamiltonian in the previous description of standard neutrino oscillations was written in the basis of mass eigenstates .",
    "an alternative , but equivalent , description of the same phenomenon can be achieved by writing the hamiltonian in the flavour basis instead . using a hamiltonian in the flavour basis will allow us to introduce contributions from new physics in a more straightforward manner . if a neutrino is produced with flavour @xmath39 , then , after having propagated for a distance @xmath3 , its evolved state will be @xmath44 where the oscillation hamiltonian @xmath45 is the one corresponding to the standard , mass - driven , mechanism , and is written in the flavour basis .",
    "@xmath45 is related to the hamiltonian in the mass basis -the `` mass matrix''- through a similarity transformation that makes use of the unitary mixing matrix @xmath33 : @xmath46 @xmath33 is the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata mixing matrix , which can be written in terms of three mixing angles , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and one cp - violation phase , @xmath2 , as @xmath50 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 .    using the latest data from solar , atmospheric , reactor ( kamland and chooz ) and accelerator ( k2k and minos ) experiments , the authors of @xcite found the best - fit values ( @xmath53 ) of the standard oscillation parameters to be @xmath54 the are no experimental values for @xmath2 presently .",
    "motivated by the vector coupling considered in eq .",
    "( [ eqlagrangian ] ) , and in analogy to the standard oscillation scenario , we can introduce an energy - independent contribution in the form of the hamiltonian ( also in the flavour basis ) @xmath55 where @xmath27 .",
    "following @xcite , we write the mixing matrix in this case as @xmath56 the mixing angles associated with this hamiltonian are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 fills the role of @xmath2 in the standard hamiltonian .",
    "the two extra phases , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , appear because of how the mixing matrix between flavour and mass eigenstates was defined in section [ section_theory_sub_stdosc ] .",
    "@xmath63 is dependent on eight parameters -two eigenvalues ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) , three mixing angles ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) and three phases ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62)- whose values are currently unknown . experimental upper limits",
    "@xcite , however , have been set for @xmath64 , using solar and super - kamiokande data , and @xmath66 , using atmospheric and k2k data : @xmath67    the full hamiltonian , including standard oscillations and the energy - independent contribution , is then @xmath68 in section [ section_intro ] , we saw that @xmath45 has been experimentally demonstrated to be the dominant contribution to the oscillations in the low energy ( mev - tev ) regime : according to eq .",
    "( [ eqbijlimits ] ) , the values of the @xmath69 are too low for the new physics , if there is any , to manifest at these energies . the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath45 , however , allows us to explore the possibility that , at higher energies , when its contribution is reduced , the effect of an energy - independent hamiltonian @xmath63 becomes comparable to it or even dominant .",
    "such energy requirement is expected to be fullfilled by the uhe astrophysical neutrino flux ( see section [ section_intro ] . )",
    "we would like to write the flavour transition probability corresponding to this hamiltonian in a form analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eqtransprobavg ] ) . in order to do this , we need to know what is the mixing matrix @xmath70 between the flavour basis and the basis in which @xmath71 is diagonal . according to basic linear algebra , this",
    "is achieved simply by diagonalising @xmath71 , finding its normalised eigenvectors , and building @xmath70 by arranging them in column form .",
    "the components of the resulting matrix are in general complicated functions of the standard mixing parameters ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath2 ) and of the parameters of @xmath63 ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) . in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eqtransprobavg ] ) , the average flavour transition probability associated to the full hamiltonian @xmath71 is then @xmath77_{\\alpha i}\\rvert^2 \\lvert\\left[u_f\\right]_{\\beta i}\\rvert^2 ~.\\ ] ] by comparing the mixing matrix obtained by diagonalisation of @xmath71 with a general pmns matrix , eq .  ( [ eqpmnsmatrix ] ) with mixing angles @xmath78 and",
    "phase @xmath79 , we are then able to calculate how the effective mixing angles @xmath78 vary with the parameters of @xmath63 and @xmath2 .",
    "succintly put , we have @xmath80    up to this point , @xmath70 is dependent on @xmath81 free parameters .",
    "however , the standard mixing parameters @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 have been fixed by neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "additionally , in order to simplify the analysis , in the present work we have set all of the phases to zero , i.e. @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , also to simplify our analysis , we have made the eigenvalues of @xmath45 proportional to those of @xmath63 , at an energy of @xmath85 pev , that is , @xmath86 with @xmath87 the proportionality constant .",
    "the upper bounds on the @xmath69 , eq .",
    "( [ eqbijlimits ] ) , are satisfied for @xmath88 .",
    "thus we are left with only four free parameters to vary : @xmath87 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "in the preceding section , we saw that , in order for the energy - independent contribution to flavour transitions to be visible , we would need to use the expected high - energy astrophysical neutrino flux .",
    "as mentioned in section [ section_intro ] , the sources of this flux , e.g.  active galaxies , are located at distances of tens to hundreds of mpc , so that the appropriate flavour transition probability to be used is the average one , eq .",
    "( [ eqtransprobavg ] ) .",
    "if , at the sources , neutrinos of different flavours are produced in the ratios @xmath89 , then , because of flavour transitions during propagation , the ratios at detection will be @xmath90 for @xmath91 . evidently , the initial flavour ratios depend on the astrophysics at source , which is currently not known with high certainty .",
    "the standard initial flux @xcite considers that the charged pions created in proton - proton and proton - photon collisions decay into neutrinos and muons , which decay into neutrinos , too : @xmath92 such process yields @xmath93 . in the standard oscillation scenario , i.e. in the absence of the energy - independent contribution , plugging this initial flux into eq .",

    "in the standard scenario , this initial flux yields a detected flux of @xmath97 . alternatively , a scenario of pure-@xmath98 production ( @xmath99 ) through beta decay has been considered , e.g.  in @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "high - energy nuclei emmited by the source have sufficient energy for photodisintegration to occur , but not enough to reach the threshold for pion photoproduction .",
    "the neutrons created in the process generate @xmath100 through beta decay .",
    "for this initial flux , the resulting detected fluxes , in the standard oscillation scenario , are @xmath101 . in what follows",

    "assuming that the neutrinos decay into products that are not detectable ( i.e. `` invisible daughters '' such as sterile neutrinos ) , then , following @xcite , the flux of flavour @xmath39 at earth will be @xmath137_{\\beta i}\\rvert^2 \\lvert \\left[u_0\\right]_{\\alpha i}\\rvert^2 e^{-l/\\tau_i }    ~~\\underrightarrow{l\\gg\\tau_i}~~ \\sum_{\\beta = e,\\mu,\\tau } \\sum_{i\\text{(stable ) } } \\phi_\\beta^0 \\lvert \\left[u_0\\right]_{\\beta i}\\rvert^2 \\lvert \\left[u_0\\right]_{\\alpha i}\\rvert^2 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath138 is the lifetime of the @xmath19-th mass eigenstate in the laboratory frame .",
    "as explained in @xcite , this expression corresponds to the case where the decay has been completed when the neutrinos arrive at earth .    in a normal hierarchy , @xmath139 is the only stable state and so @xmath140_{\\alpha1 } \\rvert^2 \\sum_{\\beta = e,\\mu,\\tau } \\phi_\\beta^0 \\lvert \\left[u_0\\right]_{\\beta 1 } \\rvert^2~,\\ ] ] while in an inverted hierarchy @xmath141 is the stable state and @xmath140_{\\alpha3 } \\rvert^2 \\sum_{\\beta = e,\\mu,\\tau } \\phi_\\beta^0 \\lvert \\left[u_0\\right]_{\\beta 3 } \\rvert^2~,\\ ] ]    in figure [ figscattersr_1sigma_lambda100 ] , decay to @xmath139 has been coloured red and decay to @xmath141 , green .",
    "we see that the @xmath123 region for decay into @xmath139 does not intersect the region accessible with @xmath121 , assuming an initial flux of @xmath105 or @xmath108 .",
    "it is , however , totally contained within the allowed region for @xmath111 , and thus there is a possibility of not being able to disentangle the effects of neutrino decay ( in a normal hierarchy ) from an energy - independent contribution , under this production model .",
    "the region allowed for decay into @xmath141 , on the other hand , is superposed to that of @xmath108 , for values of @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "a notable feature of this plot is that it reveals that , while there are many opportunities of establishing the presence of an energy - independent contribution by measuring @xmath115 and @xmath116 , it is a more difficult task to deduce from this measurement what the initial flux was .",
    "an extreme example occurs in the region around @xmath144 , @xmath145 , where the three assumptions of initial flux result in the same prediction for @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "in other words , if we measured values for @xmath115 and @xmath116 around this region , we could conclude ( provided there are no other new physics effects ) that there is an energy - independent contribution present , but we could not conclude what the initial flux was . on the other hand ,",
    "if we measured a value of @xmath146 , then ( again , assuming there are no unaccounted effects ) , we could conclude both that there is an energy - independent contribution _ and _ that the initial flux was @xmath108 .",
    "the same would occur if we measured @xmath147 , @xmath148 : in this case , in addition to concluding that an energy - independent contribution is present , we could also conclude that the initial flux was @xmath111 .",
    "as evidenced in figure [ figscattersr_1sigma_lambda1 ] , if we now make the contributions from standard , mass - driven , oscillations and energy - independent new physics comparable , effectively setting @xmath149 , the regions of allowed values of @xmath115 and @xmath116 do not change significantly with respect to the case with @xmath121 , corresponding to dominance of the new physics .",
    "hence , it is not necessary for the new physics effects to be dominant in order for them to affect the astrophysical flavour neutrino flux in a measurable way . in the @xmath149 case , however , we recover some capability to disentangle neutrino decays to @xmath139 from the allowed region corresponding to the production mechanism @xmath111 .",
    "additionally , for values of @xmath150 and @xmath151 , it seems to be possible to identify , in principle , the production mechanism to be @xmath105 .    because @xmath116 depends on the number of @xmath120 s detected , and given that this is expected to be a low number ( e.g. one every two years at icecube @xcite ) , the uncertainty on @xmath116 , using the present generation of neutrino telescopes ,",
    "will be high .",
    "figures [ figscattersr_1sigma_lambda1 ] and [ figscattersr_1sigma_lambda100 ] show estimated error bars at the points corresponding to standard oscillations using the best - fit values of the mixing angles , considering a @xmath152 uncertainty on @xmath116 , due to the low statistics of @xmath120 , and a lower value of @xmath153 for @xmath115 , dominated by the systematic error introduced by the atmospheric @xmath95 flux . nevertheless ,",
    "knowledge of only @xmath115 could be enough to establish whether energy - independent new physics exists at the uhe scale or even to deduce what the initial was .",
    "for instance , we have seen that , if a value of @xmath115 between @xmath154 and @xmath155 is measured then we could establish that there is energy - independent new physics and that the initial flux is @xmath108 .",
    "we have shown that introducing an energy - independent contribution to neutrino flavour oscillations in the form of an additional term in the oscillation hamiltonian affects the mixing angles , which , in turn , modify the flavour - transition probabilities .",
    "this contribution is motivated by scenarios of new physics such as flavour - dependent coupling to the gravitational field and violation of cpt symmetry .",
    "given that the standard oscillation hamiltonian has a @xmath22 dependence on energy , we have considered in our analysis the expected ultra - high - energy astrophysical neutrino flux , so that it becomes possible for the dominant term in the full oscillation hamiltonian to be the energy - independent term .",
    "this flux , however , propagates over distances of tens or hundres of mpc , so that we need to use the average flavour - transition probability and , more importantly , it makes sense to consider the possibility that neutrino decays occur .",
    "the modifications to the mixing angles result in a change in the expected flux of each flavour that arrives at earth , which depends both on the initial flux of each flavour and on the oscillation probabilities .    for the initial flavour fluxes ,",
    "we have considered three possibilities : either neutrinos are produced by the decay of pions generated in proton - proton and proton - photon collisions , and of the muons produced by pion decay , which yields an initial flux of @xmath93 ; or , in a situation where the muons lose most of their energy before decaying , they are produced predominantly as direct products of the decay of pions , which yields a pure-@xmath95 flux of @xmath108 ; or else they are produced by the beta decay of neutrons liberated in the photodisintegration of nuclei , yielding a pure-@xmath98 flux of @xmath111 .",
    "we have defined the ratios @xmath156 and @xmath157 , and shown that large deviations from their standard values are possible , in all three neutrino production scenarios , given our current lack of knowledge about the intervening new physics parameters .",
    "both when the effects of the new physics are dominant as well as when they are comparable to the standard oscillation terms , our ability to deduce , from a single measurement of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the existence of an energy - independent contribution _ and _ the value of the initial flux is dependent on the particular values of @xmath115 , @xmath116 measured . given that the number of @xmath120 s to be detected at current neutrino telescopes is very low ( about one every two years at icecube ) , however , the uncertainty on @xmath116 will be quite high . in spite of this , knowledge of only @xmath115",
    "could be enough to establish the presence of the extra contribution or to deduce what the initial flux was , with particular sensitivity to a @xmath108 initial flux .",
