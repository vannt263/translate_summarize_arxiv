    "universal scaling behavior appears to be an ubiquitous property of critical dynamic systems . while initially believed to hold only in the long time limit , it was realized during the last decade that the dynamical scaling hypothesis can be extended to the short - time limit  @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished by assuming that , close to the critical point , the @xmath0 moment of the order parameter obeys the homogeneity relation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is time , @xmath3 is the reduced temperature @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the linear system size , @xmath6 is the initial value of the order parameter and @xmath7 is a spatial rescaling parameter .",
    "@xmath8 is a universal exponent that describes the short - time behavior , while @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the usual critical exponents .",
    "when @xmath12 we recover the usual dynamic scaling relation , from which a power law relaxation at the critical point ( for instance , in the magnetization @xmath13 ) @xmath14 when @xmath15 and @xmath16 follows .",
    "this is the critical slowing down .    on the other hand , the short - time dynamics ( std ) scaling properties of the system",
    "depend on the initial preparation , i.e. , on the scaling field @xmath6 .",
    "setting @xmath17 , from eq .",
    "( [ scaling1 ] ) one obtains for small ( but non - null ) values of @xmath18 in the large @xmath5 limit @xmath19 hence , at the critical point @xmath20 an initial increase of the magnetization @xmath21 is observed .",
    "for the second moment @xmath22 the dependency on @xmath6 can be neglected when @xmath23 . since @xmath24 in the large @xmath5 limit (",
    "@xmath25 is the spatial dimension ) , one obtains at the critical point @xmath26    the short - time universal scaling behavior has been verified in a large variety of critical systems both by renormalization group ( rg ) calculations  @xcite and monte carlo ( mc ) numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis also applies when the system starts in the completely ordered state , i.e. , @xmath27 . in this case",
    "it is assumed that the homogeneity relation @xmath28 holds even for short ( macroscopic ) time scales .",
    "hence , in the large @xmath5 limit we have @xmath29 and taking the derivative of @xmath30 , @xmath31    while the scaling hypothesis starting from the disordered state is supported both by numerical simulations and rg , its validity for an initial ordered state relies up to now only on numerical simulations .",
    "recently , numerical simulations have shown that the short - time scaling hypothesis ( [ scaling1 ] ) holds not only close to a critical point , but also close to spinodal points in systems exhibiting a first - order phase transition , both for mean - field and short - range interactions models  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly interesting , because it suggests the existence of some kind of diverging correlation length associated to a spinodal point . since the proper concept of spinodal in short - range interactions systems is still a matter of debate ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , a deeper understanding of the microscopic mechanisms behind the observed short time scaling could shed some light on this problem .",
    "one way of achieving this goal is to look for exact solutions of particular models .",
    "a first step in that direction is to analyze mean - field ( i.e. , infinite - range interactions ) models , for which the concept of spinodal is well defined  @xcite .",
    "that is the objective of the present work : we analyze the exact std behavior of far from equilibrium mean - field systems with non - conserved order parameter .",
    "non - equilibrium phenomena in physics and other fields are commonly studied through fokker - planck equations ( fpes ) . in particular , non - equilibrium dynamical aspects of phase transitions",
    "can be analyzed by means of the fpe associated to the master equation describing the microscopic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this tool was proved to be useful in the description of the relaxation of metastable states  @xcite , finite - size effects  @xcite or the impact of fluctuations in control parameters  @xcite , and have been considered for mean - field spin models  @xcite and coupled oscillators  @xcite , amongst many others .",
    "as soon as the degrees of freedom of the system can be reduced to a few relevant ones , a low - dimensional fpe can be found .",
    "although this description is suitable for properties that do not depend on the details of the dynamics , or for mean - field kinetics , many conclusions are expected to hold in more general instances .    for a single order parameter @xmath32 ,",
    "the fpe for its probability @xmath33 is @xmath34 p \\equiv l_{fp}(m)p   \\,,\\ ] ] where the drift and diffusion coefficients are determined by the hamiltonian and the particular dynamics ( e.g. , glauber or metropolis ) .    following this stochastic approach , here we study the scaling of the short - time relaxational dynamics in the vicinity of critical and spinodal points .",
    "in first approximation , the drift @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is generically linear in the vicinity of a critical point and quadratic in the spinodal , following the quadratic and cubic behavior of the drift potential @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , typically in various models , the noise intensity @xmath38 scales as @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "therefore , although we will present the std for a particular spin model , our results can be straightforwardly extended to more general mean - field ones .",
    "the formal solution of the fpe  ( [ fpe ] ) , for the initial condition @xmath40 , is  @xcite @xmath41 the average of an arbitrary quantity @xmath42 can be derived directly from the fpe , by means of the adjoint fokker - plank operator @xmath43 , as follows @xmath44^k q(m_0)\\,t^k / k !",
