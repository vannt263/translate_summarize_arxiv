    "such corrections are a direct consequence of the nucleon s _ pion cloud _  essentially , a dressing of the nucleon wavefunction by short - lived configurations of virtual @xmath0 mesons , of which the pion as the lightest mode is expected to dominate at small momenta ( @xmath1 mev ) .",

    "the existence of the pion cloud is in principle well - established by a substantial body of experimental measurements and theoretical analyses ( _ e.g. _ , of light quark sea asymmetries @xmath5(x ) \\neq 0 $ ] relevant to gottfried sum rule violation @xcite ) . at the same time",
    ", the detailed momentum dependence of the pion - nucleon vertex remains a significant source of model dependence in any effort at first - principles calculation ; proposed dis extractions of the pion structure function ( sf ) @xmath6 at the crucial pion mass pole @xmath7 depend upon sensitivity to mechanisms including those depicted in fig .",
