    "decision - making is an important issue in many fields such as signal detection , psychology , radiology , and medicine .",
    "for example , preoperative diagnostic tests are medically necessary and implemented in clinical preventive medicine to determine those patients for whom surgery is beneficial . for the sake of cost - saving or performance improvement , new diagnostic tests are often introduced and the classification accuracies of them are evaluated and compared with the existing ones .",
    "the roc curve , a plot of the true positive rate ( tpr ) versus the false positive rate ( fpr ) for each possible cut point , has been widely used for this purpose when the considered diagnostic tests are continuous .",
    "one advantage of the roc curve is that it describes the inherent classification capability of a biomarker without specifying a specific threshold .",
    "moreover , the invariance characteristic of roc curve in measurement scale provides a suitable base to compare different biomarkers . generally , the more the curve moves toward the point @xmath0 , the better a biomarker performs .    in many applications , the area under the roc curve ( auc ) ,",
    "one of the most popular summary measures of the roc curve , is used to evaluate the classification ability of a biomarker .",
    "it has the probability meaning that the considered biomarker of a randomly selected diseased case is greater than that of a non - diseased one .",
    "generally , a perfect biomarker will have the auc of one while a poor one takes a value close to 0.5 . since the auc is the whole area under the roc curve",
    ", relevant information might not be entirely captured in some cases .",
    "for example , two crossed roc curves can have the same auc but totally different performances .",
    "furthermore , there might be limited or no data in the region of high fpr . in view of these drawbacks , it is more useful to see the pauc within a certain range of tpr or fpr . to evaluate the performance of several biomarkers , mcclish ( 1989 )",
    "adopted the summary measure pauc for the fpr over a practically relevant interval . on the other hand ,",
    "jian , metz , nishikawa ( 1996 ) showed that women with false - negative findings at mammography can not be benefited from timely treatment of the cancer .",
    "thus , these authors suggested using the pauc with a portion of the true positive range in their applied data .",
    "although their perspectives are different , the main frame is the same : only the practically acceptable area under the roc curve is assessed . as mentioned by dwyer ( 1997 )",
    ", the pauc is a regional analysis of the roc curve intermediate between the auc and individual points on the roc curve .",
    "the pauc becomes a good measure of classification accuracy because it is easier for a practitioner to determine a range of tpr or / and fpr that are relevant .",
    "several estimation and inference procedures have been proposed by emir , wieand , jung , and ying ( 2000 ) , zhang , zhou , freeman , and freeman ( 2002 ) , dodd and pepe ( 2003 ) , among others .",
    "a more thorough understanding of the roc , auc , and pauc can be also found in zhou , mcclish , and obuchowski ( 2002 ) .",
    "recent research in roc methodology has extended the binary disease status to the time - dependent setting .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the time to a specific disease or death and @xmath2 represent the continuous diagnostic marker measured before or onset of the study with joint survivor function @xmath3 .",
    "for each fixed time point @xmath4 , the disease status can be defined as a case if @xmath5 and a control otherwise . to evaluate the ability of @xmath2 in classifying subjects who is diseased before time @xmath4 or not ,",
    "heagerty , lumley , and pepe ( 2000 ) generalized the traditional tpr and fpr to the time - dependent tpr and fpr as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which can be further derived to be @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 . for the time - dependent auc , chambless and diao ( 2006 ) , chiang , wang , and hung ( 2008 ) , and chiang and hung ( 2008 ) proposed different nonparametric estimators and developed the corresponding inference procedures .",
    "as for the time - dependent pauc , there is still far too little research on this topic . we propose nonparametric estimators , which are shown to converge weakly to gaussian processes , and the estimators for the corresponding variance - covariance functions .",
    "the established properties facilitate us to make inference on the time - dependent pauc and can be reasonably applied to the time - dependent auc because it is a special case of this summary measure .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the nonparametric estimation and inference procedures are proposed for the time - dependent pauc .",
    "the finite sample properties of the estimators and the performance of the constructed confidence bands are studied through monte carlo simulations in section 3 .",
    "section 4 presents an application of our method to the actg 175 study . in this section ,",
    "an extended inference procedure is further provided for the comparison of the time - dependent paucs .",
    "some conclusions and future works are addressed in section 5 .",
    "finally , the proof of main results is followed in the appendix .",
    "in this section , we estimate the time - dependent pauc and develop the corresponding inference procedures . without loss of generality , the time - dependent pauc is discussed for restricted @xmath11 because that for restricted @xmath12 can be derived in the same way by reversing the roles of case and control subjects .",
    "let @xmath13 be the minimum of @xmath1 and censoring time @xmath14 , @xmath15 represent the censoring status , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 $ ] , denote the @xmath18 quantile of @xmath2 conditioning on @xmath19 at the fixed time point @xmath4 .",

    "same with the interpretation of cai and dodd ( 2008 ) , the rescaled time - dependent pauc @xmath26 can be explained as the probability that the test result of a case @xmath27 is higher than that of a control @xmath28 with its value exceeding @xmath29 for @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 .    from the formulation in ( [ 1.1 ] ) , an estimator of @xmath21 can be obtained if @xmath23 is estimable . under marker",

    "the application of kernel function @xmath52 provides the nearest neighbor estimator of @xmath23 .",
    "an alternative choice of kernel function is possible and will lead to a different estimator of @xmath21 . as mentioned in akritas ( 1994 ) ,",
    "the asymptotic properties of @xmath41 is irrelevant to the choice of kernel function under some regularity conditions and so is @xmath53 .",
    "the author further showed that any other estimator for @xmath23 is at least as dispersed as @xmath41 and the choice of @xmath40 is irrelevant to the measurement scale of @xmath2 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the estimation problem of @xmath21 becomes that of @xmath23 . from this perspective",
    ", the proposed estimation procedure can be extended to any censoring or truncation mechanisms provided that @xmath23 is estimable .",
    "alternatively , one might be interested in making inference on the time - dependent pauc @xmath54 over the range @xmath55 $ ] , @xmath56 , of @xmath57 .",
    "the estimator @xmath58 is suggested and the limiting gaussian process of @xmath59 is a direct consequence of the large sample property of @xmath53 . when the complete failure time data @xmath60 are available , @xmath23 can be estimated by an empirical estimator @xmath61 .",
    "a natural estimator for @xmath21 is obtained as @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . by substituting the disease and disease - free groups for the time - varying case and control ones , @xmath66 and the estimator @xmath67 will reduce to the time - invariant pauc and the nonparametric estimator of dodd and pepe ( 2003 ) . by the similar argument as in the proof of the asymptotic gaussian process of @xmath53 , it is straightforward to derive that @xmath68 converges weekly to a gaussian process with mean zero and variance - covariance function @xmath69 $ ] , where @xmath70 @xmath71 - 2h(t , y)$ ] , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",

    "when survival times are subject to censoring , an appropriate smoothing parameter urgently becomes necessary in the estimation of @xmath66 .",
    "it usually attempts to select a bandwidth that minimizes the asymptotic mean squared error of an estimator , which is obtained by using the plug - in method for unknown parameters .",
    "this approach , however , would lead to further bandwidth selection problems and is infeasible in our current setting . for the bandwidth selection ,",
    "we propose a simple and easily implemented data - driven method .",
    "this procedure is to find a bandwidth , say , @xmath117 which minimizes the following integrated squared error @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the kaplan - meier estimator computed based on the data @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 is computed as @xmath123 with the @xmath124th observation @xmath125 deleted , and @xmath126 . the rationale behind ( [ 3.1 ] )",

    "moreover , the variance @xmath143 tends to be underestimated , which leads to a lower coverage probability .",
    "as expected , the bias and standard deviation of @xmath129 will separately increase and decrease as the bandwidth becomes larger .",
    "it is also detected from these tables that the poor estimates of @xmath144 s appear at extremely small or large bandwidths . in the numerical studies , the larger bias of @xmath145",
    "is found and the main reason for this is because it is computed via comparing only ( at most ) the top ten percent of subjects in the control group with those in the case group . for @xmath146 , the availability of data used for statistical analysis is expanded and , hence , the performance becomes better .",
    "the biases of the proposed estimators is indistinguishable in the presence of heavy censoring , whereas the standard deviations and the standard errors will become larger . at each simulated sample",
    ", we can see that the estimators using @xmath117 provide generally satisfactory results .",
    "the empirical coverage probabilities of pointwise confidence intervals ( tables 1 - 3 ) show the good performance of bandwidths selected from the automatic selection procedure for interval estimation , except for @xmath147 of @xmath148 and @xmath149 at the time point @xmath111 . however , most of the coverage probabilities are lower than 0.95 for the bandwidths of 0.01 and 0.2 . for samples without censoring , it is revealed from tables 1 - 3 that the empirical coverage probabilities of the pointwise confidence intervals computed based on @xmath129 with @xmath117 are more close to the nominal level of 0.95 than those based on @xmath150 .",
    "similar conclusions can be also drawn from table 4 for the simultaneous coverage probabilities .",

    "in the actg 175 study ( hammer et al . ( 1996 ) ) , the classification accuracy of cd4 cell counts on the time in weeks from entry to aids diagnosis or death might depend on whether they received the prior antiretroviral therapy .",

    "the confidence intervals for @xmath157 s are further constructed from ( [ 2.4 ] ) and ( [ 2.6 ] ) . due to the large variation of estimators before week 98",

    "based on the summary measures @xmath158 s and compared with 0.005 , one can conclude from the simultaneous confidence bands that the cd4 count is a useless biomarker in classifying patient s survival time within the considered time period for both therapy and non - therapy patients .",
    "however , a different conclusion will be drawn at each time point based on the pointwise confidence intervals .",
    "the time - dependent paucs @xmath159 and @xmath160 are detected to be significantly higher than @xmath161 for @xmath22=0.2 and 0.3 after week 110 and week 98 , respectively .",
    "figures 1 ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( e ) give a clear indication that the paucs decrease slightly over time for patients without prior therapy .",
    "however , the paucs stay very close to a constant throughout the study period for those with prior therapy ( figures 1 ( b ) , ( d ) , and ( f ) ) .",

    "it is revealed in figures 2 ( a)-(c ) that @xmath166 , @xmath22=0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 , tend to be positive within the study period and the difference becomes negligible as @xmath22 increases .",
    "in other words , with small values of @xmath11 , a prior antiretroviral therapy might lower the discrimination ability of cd4 counts in classifying subject s t - week survival .",
    "one possible explanation for this conclusion is that the prior therapy makes patients more homogeneous in survival time and cd4 counts .",
    "the estimates are further found to be around zero after about week 160 .",
    "it means that for long term survival classification the performance of cd4 counts is irrelevant to whether patients receive prior therapy or not . due to the large variability in the data",
    ", we could not detect any significant difference between @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "it would necessitate extremely large sample sizes to enable demonstration of significant differences between the paucs .",
    "for the time - dependent pauc , it was traditionally estimated by the trapezoidal numerical integration method . the derivation for its",
    "sampling distribution becomes complicated and the computation load is prohibitively expensive .",
    "although the inferences can be developed through a bootstrap technique , there is still no rigorous theoretical justification for this procedure .",
    "we can see in this article that the proposed estimators are simple and have explicit mathematical expressions .",

    "the estimation and inference procedures are further shown to be useful through simulation studies and an application to the actg 175 data .",
    "it is detected from our numerical studies that the performance of the proposed estimator @xmath53 is very sensitive to small value of @xmath22 . to obtain a more stable estimate of @xmath21 , a large sample size relative to @xmath22",
    "is usually suggested especially in the presence of censoring .",
    "moreover , the price for the assumption of marker dependent censoring is to find an appropriate bandwidth in estimation .",
    "to this problem , we propose a simple and easily implemented selection procedure and show its good performance through simulations . as for the estimation of @xmath180",
    ", it can be also derived via using the bivariate estimation methods of campbell ( 1981 ) or burke ( 1988 ) for @xmath23 .",
    "however , these estimators are only valid under independent censorship which appears to be very limited and may not always be met in applications .",
    "one advantage of totally independent censoring assumption is that no smoothing technique is required",
    ".    in some empirical examples , censored survival data of the form @xmath181 are often occurred in a paired design with @xmath182 being the different biomarkers of the @xmath124th subject .",
    "the scientific interest usually focuses on comparing the discrimination abilities of @xmath162 and @xmath163 on subject s survival status at each time point within the study period .",
    "obviously , the assumptions of marker dependent censoring made separately on @xmath183 and @xmath184 are often unreasonable in practice . under a more flexible assumption of conditionally independent censorship ( @xmath1 and @xmath14 are independent conditioning on @xmath185 ) , the estimated joint survivor function of @xmath1 and @xmath162 and that of @xmath1 and @xmath163 in this article are quite inadequate in the estimation of @xmath166 without modification .",

    "<S> can be used to measure the usefulness of a biomarker for disease detection over time . without using a trapezoidal rule , </S>",
    "<S> we propose nonparametric estimators , which are easily computed and have closed - form expressions , for the time - dependent pauc . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic gaussian processes of the estimators are established and the estimated variance - covariance functions are provided , which are essential in the construction of confidence intervals . </S>",
    "<S> the finite sample performance of the proposed inference procedures are investigated through a series of simulations . </S>",
    "<S> our method is further applied to evaluate the classification ability of cd4 cell counts on patient s survival time in the aids clinical trials group ( actg ) 175 study . </S>",
