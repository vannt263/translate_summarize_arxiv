    "the spacetime around an isolated black hole is flat and minkowskian at a large distance where usual quantum mechanics is applicable , while the spacetime closer to the singularity is curved and no satisfactory quantum field theory could be developed as yet .",
    "however , occasionally , it is useful to look into an intermediate situation when a weak perturbation ( due to , say , gravitational , electromagnetic or dirac waves ) originating from infinity scatters from a black hole .",
    "the resulting wave is partially transmitted into the black hole through the horizon and partially scatters off from it to infinity . in the linearized ( ` test field ' )",
    "approximation this problem has been attacked in the past by several authors [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "these methods are mostly numerical and most of the solutions obtained so far is for particles of integral spin only .",
    "chandrasekhar [ 3 - 4 ] separated the dirac equation in kerr geometry into radial and angular parts .",
    "these works were extended to other spacetimes , such as in kerr - newman geometry [ 5 ] , and around dyon black holes [ 6 ] .",
    "subsequently , chakrabarti [ 7 ] solved the angular part of the dirac equation in kerr geometry and gave the eigenvalues of the equation .",
    "these and the present works mostly concern scattering off tiny black holes and thus changing the incoming solution appreciably into an outgoing solution . scattering effects from larger black holes could be studied by phase shift analysis and these has also been done recently [ 8 ] .    in the present paper , we attack a simpler problem to have a ` feel ' for the complete solution when the black hole is non - rotating . in the next section , we present the basic equations . in  3 ,",
    "we classify the parameter space in terms of the physical and unphysical regions and present the method we adopt to solve the equations . in  4 , we present a complete solution . in  5 , we present solutions using a classical method in which the potential is approximated by a series of steps and then compare solutions of these two methods . in  6 , we also compare solutions of various parameters and show how a schwarzschild black hole distinguishes incoming particles of various masses .",
    "finally , in  7 , we draw our conclusions .",
    "following chandrasekhar [ 4 ] , the radial part of the dirac equation is easily reduced into a schrdinger like equation . however , because the spin - spin coupling term is absent in the schwarzschild geometry , the radial equation is much simpler to deal with .",
    "the eigenvalue of the angular equation for spin @xmath0 is trivially obtained as @xmath1 [ 7 , 9 - 10 ] where @xmath2 is the orbital quantum number . in what follows ,",
    "we choose @xmath3 throughout for concreteness .",
    "this eigenvalue turns out to be the separation constant @xmath4 of the original dirac equation [ 4 ] .",
    "here we solve the equation for one possible value of separation constant @xmath4 ( for @xmath5 , @xmath4 is unity ) . in future",
    "we plan to explore the nature of the solutions for other orbital quantum numbers .    presently , we need to solve only the following coupled radial equations [ 4 ] :    @xmath6    @xmath7    where , @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10 here @xmath11 = integer , @xmath12 = frequency of incoming dirac wave , @xmath13 = mass of the black hole , @xmath14 = azimuthal quantum number , @xmath15 = rest mass of the dirac particle ; p indicates particle , @xmath16 = radial wave function for spin up ( down ) particles .",
    "@xmath17 is the complex conjugate operator .",
    "it is to be noted that the dimensionless unit is chosen , so that @xmath18 .",
    "the radial equation here is in coupled form .",
    "we can decouple it and express the equation either in terms of spin up or spin down wave function .",
    "however , it is more convenient to follow chandrasekhar s [ 4 ] approach by which the basis was changed along with the independent variable @xmath19 .",
    "that way , the coupled equation was reduced into two independent one dimensional wave equations since they are easier to solve .",
    "we first define @xmath20 where , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and choose @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "in terms of @xmath25 , the operators take the form : @xmath26 and @xmath27    we choose @xmath28 which yields , @xmath29 and @xmath30    following exactly chandrasekhar s [ 4 ] approach we write @xmath31 \\eqno{(5)}\\ ] ] and @xmath32 .",

    "the differential equations ( 1 - 2 ) are re - written as @xmath35 and @xmath36 where , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 one important point to note : the transformation of spatial coordinate @xmath19 to @xmath25 ( and @xmath39 ) is taken not only for mathematical simplicity but also for a physical significance . when @xmath19 is chosen as the radial coordinate , the decoupled equations for independent waves show diverging behaviour . however , by transforming those in terms of @xmath25 ( and @xmath39 ) we obtain well behaved functions .",
    "the horizon is shifted from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",

    "we obtain solutions by employing wkb [ 11 - 12 ] method and then imposing strict boundary conditions on the horizon , so that the reflection coefficient is zero and transmission coefficient is unity at the horizon . after establishing the general solution ,",
    "we present here the solution of eq .",
    "( 9 ) for two sets of parameters as illustrative examples .",
    "it is advisable to choose the parameters in such a way that there is a significant interaction between the particle and the black hole .",
    "this is possible when the compton wavelength of the incoming wave is of the same order as the schwarzschild radius of the black hole , i.e. , @xmath46 here , we are choosing @xmath47 , so @xmath48 again , in the case of schwarzschild geometry , frequency of the incoming particle ( or , wave ) will be of the same order as inverse of time .",
    "so , @xmath49 using the units as before , one can write , @xmath50 in principle , however , one can choose any values of @xmath12 and @xmath15 for a particular black hole and the corresponding solution is possible but we shall concentrate the region of parameter space where the solution is expected to be interesting as pointed out above , namely , region close to @xmath51 . in fig . 1a , we draw this line .",
    "the parameter space is spanned by the frequency @xmath12 and the rest mass of the incoming particle @xmath15 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath52 of total parameter space where @xmath53 is unphysical , and one need not study this region .",
    "rest of the parameter space ( @xmath54 ) is divided into two regions  i : @xmath55 and ii : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the maximum of the potential . while in region i , the wave is _ locally _ sinusoidal because the wave number @xmath58 is real for the entire range of @xmath59 . in region ii , on the other hand , the wave is decaying in some region when @xmath60 , i.e. , where the wave ` hits ' the potential barrier and in the rest of the region , the wave is propagating",

    "one has to employ different method ( such as using airy functions , see below ) to find solutions in this region .",
    "in this region , for any set of parameter , energy of the particle is always greater than the corresponding potential energy .",
    "we first re - write equation ( 9 ) as , @xmath68 this is nothing but schrdinger equation corresponding to the total energy of the wave @xmath69 .",
    "this can be solved by regular wkb method [ 11 - 12 ] .",

    "here , @xmath94 is to be determined self - consistently by equating the asymptotic behaviour of this reflection coefficient with that obtained using wkb method .",

    "in this paper , we analytically studied scattering of spin - half particles from a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "in particular , we presented the nature of the radial wave functions and the reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "our main motivation was to give an analytical expression of the solution which could be useful for further study of interactions among hawking radiations , for instance .",
    "we verified that these analytical solutions were indeed correct by explicitly solving the same set of equations numerically using step - potential approach as described in section v. we classified the entire parameter space in terms of the physical and unphysical regions and the physical region was further classified into two regions , depending on whether the particle ` hits ' the potential barrier or not .",
    "we chose one illustrative example in each of the regions .",
    "we emphasize that the most ` interesting ' region to study would be close to @xmath201 .",

    "1b ) that for @xmath202 , wkb solutions can not be trusted , and other methods ( such as those using airy functions ) must be employed .",
    "we used the well known wkb approximation method as well as the step - potential method of quantum mechanics to obtain the spatial dependence of the coefficients of the wave function .",
    "this in turn , allowed us to determine the reflection and transmission coefficients and the nature of wave functions .",
    "the usual wkb method with constant coefficients and ( almost ) constant wave number @xmath58 is successfully applied even when the coefficients and wave number are not constant everywhere .",
    "solution from this ` instantaneous ' wkb ( iwkb for short ) method agrees fully with that obtained from a purely classical numerical method where the potential is replaced by a collection of steps ( simple quantum mechanical approach ) .",
    "the resulting wave forms satisfy the inner and the outer boundary conditions .",
    "our method of obtaining solutions should be valid for any black hole geometry which are asymptotically flat so that radial waves could be used at a large distance . this way we ensure that the analytical solution is closer to the exact solution . in region",
    "ii , in some regions , wkb method can not be applied and hence airy function approach or our step - potential approach could be used .    in the literature , reflection and",
    "transmission coefficients are defined at a single point .",
    "these definitions are meaningful only if the potential sharply changes in a small region while studies are made from a large distance from it . in the present case , however , the potential changes over a large distance and we are studying in these regions as well .",
    "although we used the words ` reflection ' and ` transmission ' coefficients , in this paper very loosely , our definitions are very rigorous and well defined .",
    "these quantities are simply the instantaneous values . in our belief",
    "these are more physical .",
    "the problem at hand is very similar to the problem of reflection and transmission of acoustic waves from a strucked string of non - constant density where reflection and transmission occurs at each point .    unlike in the case of a kerr black hole ,",
    "the solution of the angular equation around a schwarzschild black hole is independent of the azimuthal or meridional angles [ 5 - 7 ] .",
    "this is expected because of symmetry of the space - time .",
    "however , otherwise , the nature of the reflection and transmission coefficients were found to strongly distinguish solutions of different rest masses and different energies as illustrated in figs .",
    "10(a - d ) .",
    "for instance , when the energy of the wave is increased for a given mass of the particle , reflected component goes down . in regions where @xmath196 , re(@xmath192 ) goes down with energy , but where @xmath194 , re(@xmath192 ) goes up with energy . in any case , the wave scattered off are distinctly different . in a way , therefore , black holes can act as a mass spectrograph ! for instance a mixture of waves should be splitted into its components by the black hole .",
    "our method is quite general and should be used to study outgoing hawking radiations also .",
