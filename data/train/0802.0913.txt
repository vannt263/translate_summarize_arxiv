    "<S> the observable line shape of the spontaneous emission depends on the procedure of atom s excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of radiation emitted by a two - level atom excited from the ground state by a pi pulse of the resonant pump field is calculated for the case when the rabi frequency is much larger than the relaxation rate . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the central part of the spectral distribution has a standard lorentzian form , whereas for detunings from the resonance that are larger than the rabi frequency the spectral density falls off faster . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the wings of the spectral line is sensitive to the form of the pi pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the implications for the quantum zeno effect theory and for the estimates of the duration of quantum jumps are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 42.50.ct , 42.50.lc , 32.70.jz    we shall treat the problem of the natural line shape - the shape of the spectral line of the spontaneous emission - the radiation emission by a secluded atom accompanying the transition from the excited state ( to some lower one ) that originates from the interaction of the atom with the quantized electromagnetic field . in what follows we use the model of the two - level atom with the excited state @xmath0 and the ground state @xmath1 with the energies @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , which are connected by the electrical dipole transition . </S>",
    "<S> the theory originally developed by weisskopf and wigner @xcite starts with the assumption of the exponential decay of the amplitude of the initial state , @xmath4 it yields the lorentzian line shape , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the transition frequency ( @xmath7 is the planck s constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> the natural linewidth is @xmath8 , where the transition rate @xmath9 is given by the equality @xmath10 that was originally derived by dirac @xcite and now is universally known as the fermi golden rule . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the initial and final states of the system `` atom + field '' , @xmath13 are the matrix elements of the interaction of atom with the quantized field , and @xmath14 is the energy density of the final states . </S>",
    "<S> the summation over the quantum numbers others than energy is carried out .    </S>",
    "<S> the expression ( 3 ) includes the values of the matrix elements and of the density of states on the energy surface @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> since the relative variations of @xmath13 and @xmath14 within the main peak of the spectral line ( 2 ) in the optical range have values about @xmath16 , the lorentzian line shape promises to be very accurate . to my knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> the deviations from ( 2 ) were never established experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> however , from the theoretical point of view the lorentzian form of spectrum is irritating . </S>",
    "<S> on one side , this expression can not be universally valid , since the negative frequencies of photons are physically meaningless . on the other side , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) gives for the mean frequency of the radiation @xmath17 the expression that diverges - literally logarithmically , but even faster , if the energy density growth @xmath18 is taken into account @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the line shape eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) can be interpreted as the form of the energy distribution @xmath19 for the quasistationary initial state of the system @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the law of decay of the initial state is given by the fourier transform of the energy distribution , @xmath21 the lorentzian form of the energy distribution leads to the exactly exponential decay law @xmath22 , that makes the weisskopf and wigner theory self - consistent . </S>",
    "<S> thence the problem of the natural line shape can be reformulated as the problem of the law of the decay of the initial state : deviations from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) will lead to the nonexponentiality of the decay - and vice versa . the additional incentive to study </S>",
    "<S> the detailed form of the initial stage of the decay law came from the concept of the quantum zeno effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if for small times the decay law is quadratic , @xmath23 ( the parameter @xmath24 is known as the zeno time ) , then frequent measurements of the energy of the system will prevent the decay of the initial excited state . </S>",
    "<S> this property permitted schulman @xcite to introduce the estimate for the duration of the quantum jump between the atomic states as the crossover time from the quadratic decay to the exponential ( fermi ) decay : @xmath25 the logic behind this definition is lucid : if the measurement can influence the kinetics of the quantum jump , then it has not been completed yet .    </S>",
    "<S> several authors have attempted to calculate the zeno time @xmath26 for the spontaneous emission of radiation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they have used the two - level model of the atom ; in this case the account of the momentum of the emitted photon suppresses the matrix elements in the high frequency domain and effectively truncates the lorentzian line shape at the frequencies around @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the fine structure constant ( @xmath29 is the electric charge of the electron and @xmath30 is the speed of light ) , and the atomic frequency unit @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the electron s mass ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the results of these authors contradict their assumptions : if the hydrogen atom in the initial state @xmath33 can indeed emit a photon with the energy about @xmath34 , then there is no reason to limit the channels of decay by the transition only to the state @xmath35 . with the account of all possible transitions </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion @xmath36 of the energy distribution of the initial state diverges ; that prohibits the existence of the quadratic stage of the decay and makes @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the influence of the truncation of the lorentzian shape ( 2 ) in the domain @xmath38 on the decay law has been studied in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this truncation diminishes the initial decay rate by half , but does nt lead to the quadratic decay .    </S>",
    "<S> the physically unsatisfactory divergences of @xmath39 and @xmath36 are rooted in the unphysical initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it is a commonplace of the theory of quasistationary states that their properties depend on the procedure of their preparation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore this procedure must be taken into account explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of this approach in the problem of the natural line shape was noted long time ago @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let s assume that the atom initially was in the ground state @xmath1 and then was excited by a pulse of the resonant pump field ( of the frequency @xmath40 ) that has the properties of the pi pulse @xcite , that conveys the two - level system ( in the absence of relaxation ) from one state into the other . </S>",
    "<S> we take the hamiltonian of the system in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the hamiltonians of the two - level atom and of the quantized field respectively , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 take account of the atom s interaction with the quantized radiation field and with the classical pump field correspondingly . in the dipole approximation </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath46\\ ] ] where the index @xmath47 numerates the modes of the quantized field . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 is the quantization volume , @xmath49 is the operator of the momentum of the atomic electron , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the frequency of the photon and the polarization vector of the mode @xmath47 respectively , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the creation and annihilation operators for this mode . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath45 is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the envelope of the electric field of the pulse .    </S>",
    "<S> the state vector of the system can be expanded as @xmath56 where @xmath57 denote states of the system with the atom in the state @xmath58 and the field in the vacuum state ; in the state @xmath59 the atom is in the ground state @xmath60 , one photon is present in the mode @xmath47 , and there are no photons in other modes ; @xmath61 .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the system is governed by the system of equations @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath63 @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the ( time - dependent ) rabi frequency , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the matrix element of the momentum between the states @xmath1 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the frequency detuning between the atomic transition and the emitted photon .    </S>",
    "<S> let s consider the pi pulse with the rectangular envelope , @xmath71 and assume that the rabi frequency is much larger than the relaxation rate , @xmath72 . then throughout the duration of the pulse we can neglect the spontaneous radiation , and take into account only the pump field . </S>",
    "<S> thus from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) with the initial conditions @xmath73 , @xmath74 in the rotating wave approximation we obtain @xmath75 to describe the second stage , that of the free emission , we can use the exponential decay of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) : @xmath76 by substitution of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 12 ) and integration we obtain for the limiting values of amplitudes @xmath77 : @xmath78 where the spectral amplitude is given by the expression @xmath79 the spectral distribution of photons is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the normalization constant ; in our case @xmath82 . the explicit expression for @xmath83 is too cumbersome ; it is more convenient to work with the formula ( 18 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> firstly , it must be noted that the first term in the rhs of ( 18 ) is regular at @xmath84 , since at these points both the numerator and the denominator have simple zeroes . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , for small frequency detunings @xmath85 the second term in the rhs of ( 18 ) dominates , and the line shape is given just by the standard lorentzian form ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , for large @xmath86 , after expanding both terms in negative powers of @xmath87 , we find that two terms of the order @xmath88 cancel each other . </S>",
    "<S> the dominating contribution comes from the term @xmath89 that defines the asymptotics of the spectral density @xmath90 it decreases rapidly enough to provide a finite average value of the frequency of the emitted photons @xmath91 ( that in our approximation is indistinguishable from the transition frequency @xmath40 ) and the finite value of the frequency dispersion @xmath92 .    </S>",
    "<S> it must be noted that the behavior of the wings of the spectral line depends on the form of the envelope of the pi pulse . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the spectral density @xmath93 also for the pi pulse with the sine envelope : @xmath94 the results are compared in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 with the lorentzian line shape and the spectral distribution for the rectangular envelope . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that for both types of pulses the crossovers between lorentzian and asymptotic forms occur at @xmath95 .    the dependence of the logarithm of the spectral density @xmath96 on a scaled frequency detuning @xmath97 for the rabi frequency @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> solid line - the lorentzian form ( 2 ) , dashed line corresponds to the rectangular envelope of the pi pulse , eq . ( 14 ) , dotted line - the same for the sine pulse envelope , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 21 ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the finite dispersion of the frequency defines the zeno time of the system @xcite ; thus @xmath99 . then from eq . ( 5 ) we obtain a somewhat trivial estimate for the duration of the quantum jump in our case , @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> it must be noted that indefinite increase of the amplitude of the pi pulse will eventually violate the applicability of the two - level model . </S>",
    "<S> the transitions to other states of the system are necessarily important if the rabi frequency is comparable to the transition frequency , @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> thus our model assures that the duration of the quantum jump accompanying the spontaneous emission from a given transition will always be larger than the field period , @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> this inequality is almost universally accepted by the community of physicists on the grounds of common sense and is reflected in the literature @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is limited by the domain @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare it with the opposite limiting case . for @xmath104 the rectangular `` pi pulse '' defined by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 14 ) lasts much longer than the relaxation time @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore during the most part of the pulse the initial state of the system is already ignorable , and the difference between the sequence of long `` pi pulses '' and the continuous pump field is unimportant . the spectrum of radiation of the two - level system under the influence of the continuous monochromatic field has been calculated by mollow @xcite . for @xmath104 and the pump frequency that equals that of the transition , @xmath40 , the power spectrum in our notation has the form @xmath106,\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the dirac s delta - function . </S>",
    "<S> the first term in the brackets describes the scattering of the pump radiation with unchanged frequency . </S>",
    "<S> only the second , incoherent term can be interpreted as a spectrum of the `` spontaneous '' emission by the atom that is excited by a weak resonant field . </S>",
    "<S> the term `` spontaneous '' in this case may be too stretched , since the atom in the continuous monochromatic field can hardly be considered a secluded one . however , </S>",
    "<S> if one accepts this interpretation of the incoherent term , then it may be noted that for large @xmath108 it follows the inverse quartic law , similar to our eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 20 ) . pushing the interpretation further </S>",
    "<S> , we may say that for the spectral distribution given by the incoherent term the zeno time and the quantum jump time happen to be equal : @xmath109 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that the line shape of the radiation , spontaneously emitted by an atom excited by a strong pi pulse is lorentzian only in the domain of frequency detunings that do not exceed the rabi frequency of the pulse , @xmath110 . for larger values of @xmath108 </S>",
    "<S> it falls off much faster . for the transition with the frequency @xmath111 and the momentum matrix element </S>",
    "<S> @xmath112 the spontaneous emission rate is @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition @xmath98 corresponds to the intensity of the rectangular pi pulse @xmath114 and to its duration @xmath115 . in these conditions for the lorentzian line shape approximately 6% of the emitted photons must have frequency detunings @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of shortage of these photons seems to be accessible to the modern spectroscopic experiment .    </S>",
