    "weber gravitational wave antennae are designed to weakly convert gravitational waves into acoustic vibrations@xcite .",
    "the damping of acoustic vibrations ultimately heat the detector accounting for the energy lost by the incident gravitational disturbance .",
    "the total cross section for the absorption of the gravitational wave is ( of course ) very small due to the weak nature of the gravitational forces .",
    "if @xmath0 denotes an incident graviton which is converted into a phonon @xmath1 , then the first stage of graviton absorption is thought to involve the conversion @xmath2 in the second stage of absorption , the phonon decays . in metallic samples ( such as aluminum ) at not too high a temperature , the dominant mode of decay of the phonon is into an @xciteelectron - hole pair @xmath3 the decay in eq.([phonon_decay ] ) is known to be true in virtue of experimental work on sound wave attenuation in metals .",
    "the final electronic excited states are described in terms of an effective `` electronic viscosity '' .",
    "taking eqs.([graviton_decay ] ) and ( [ phonon_decay ] ) together , one finds that the gravitational wave decays into electronic particle hole pairs via the process @xmath4 wherein the acoustic phonon @xmath5 enters into the absorption process as a virtual ( resonant ) intermediate state .",
    "also possible is the _ direct _ conversion of the graviton into an electron hole pair @xmath6    at first glance , it might appear that the electron - graviton coupling would be much weaker than the phonon - graviton coupling since the mass of the vibrating nuclei is much larger than the mass of the electrons .",
    "however , as will be discussed in detail below , the graviton couples into the _ pressure _ and _ not _ directly into the energy density . the spatial ( pressure ) part of the space - time stress tensor @xmath7 directly couples into a gravitational wave while the time ( energy density ) part of the space - time stress tensor @xmath8 couples into the newtonian part of gravity@xcite .    the electron contribution to an earthly ( ordinary )",
    "condensed matter pressure tensor @xmath9 dominates the nuclei contribution .",
    "the absorption rate of gravitational disturbances are considerably enhanced by the large kinetic energy and high density of final electronic states .",
    "a similar view has been discussed in some previous work@xcite . nevertheless , the conventional wisdom is that the nature of the acoustic wave decay rate has little to do with the total absorption rate of the gravitational wave , provided that the former is much larger than the latter @xcite .",
    "our purpose is to exhibit the flaw in the above conventional argument by providing a counter example .",
    "the fact that the electrons dominate the coupling to both the phonons and the gravitons considerably enhances the total cross section in metallic antennae ( such as aluminum ) .    in sec.2",

    "the microscopic quantum mechanical expression for the gravitational wave total cross section will be exhibited .",
    "the mathematical derivations rely on the kubo formulae ( in condensed matter physics ) for the transport coefficients associated with phonon damping . in sec.6 , the dispersion relations for the dynamical elastic coefficients will be discussed . the results will be applied to the subtracted dispersion relations for the dynamic lam coefficient and the viscosity .",

    "the feynman diagrams for the absorption of a graviton will be explored and the enhancement of the absorption due to electronic coupling will be computed . in the concluding sec .",
    "8 , we present a brief summary of our results as well as directions for future work .",
    "in relativity one considers ( in general ) a background curved space - time metric for the local proper time interval @xmath11 which arises from a solution of the einstein field equations @xmath12 upon varying by @xmath13 the `` stress '' applied to space - time @xmath14 one finds a response in the distortion ( i.e. `` strain '' @xmath15 ) of space - time by requiring a neighboring solution to eq.([gr2 ] ) ; i.e. @xmath16 the response in the strain due to the application of a stress defines the gravitational wave propagator @xmath17 via @xmath18 wherein @xmath19 .",
    "let us decompose the stress into a source @xmath20 _ external _ to the antenna and a stress",
    "_ induced _ in the antenna @xmath21 by the strain @xmath22 . in total",
    "@xmath23 the full propagator describes the response in the strain to an `` external '' stress @xmath24 while the `` induced '' stress responds to the strain via the elastic response function @xmath25 we note in passing that eqs.([gr5])-([gr8 ] ) imply dyson s eq.([gr9 ] ) below ; i.e. @xmath26 wherein the dynamic elastic coefficients @xmath27 play the role of the gravitational wave propagator self energy .",
    "since the external stress radiates the incoming strain via the relation @xmath28 it follows from eqs.([gr7 ] ) , ( [ gr9 ] ) and ( [ gr10 ] ) that the gravitational wave scattering equation takes the form @xmath29 in eq.([gr11 ] ) , the total gravitational wave is the sum of an incoming gravitational wave and an `` elastic '' scattered gravitational wave @xmath30 from the imaginary part of the forward elastic scattering amplitude one may compute the total cross section for the wave to scatter off the antenna . since the propagator @xmath31 contains the weak gravitational coupling strength @xmath32 to first order , it is sufficient to employ the lowest born amplitude for the scattered gravitational wave @xmath33 to compute the scattered wave to lowest order in @xmath32 one needs to know ( i ) the incoming gravitational wave @xmath34 , ( ii ) the dynamic elastic coefficients @xmath35 of the antenna and ( iii ) the unperturbed ( by the antenna ) gravitational wave propagator @xmath31 .",
    "let us consider this in more detail .",
    "consider a gravitational wave moving through a flat space - time background in a reference frame in which an antenna is at rest . in the transverse traceless gauge",
    "one may describe the gravitational wave by a spatial _ strain tensor _ @xmath36 which enters into the proper time as follows @xmath37 the definition of `` strain '' in terms of the spatial metric in @xmath38 conforms to the standard usage in elasticity theory@xcite . in terms of the traceless part of the spatial pressure tensor @xmath39 in the antenna , @xmath40 the gravitational wave equation ( with a pressure source ) reads @xmath41 the general solution of eq.([gw3 ] ) may be written @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",

    "if the wavelength of the incident graviton is large on the scale of the size @xmath68 of the antenna , @xmath69 then one may ignore the wave vectors @xmath70 in the integrals of eq.([gw17 ] ) .",
    "this constitutes the mass quadrupole approximation . for an antenna of volume @xmath71 and with @xmath72 the mass quadrupole absorption cross section is @xmath73    averaging over the initial gravitational wave polarizations ( i.e. helicity ) , @xmath74 and defining the transverse dynamical elastic lam coefficient as @xmath75 yields the total cross section @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes a unit vector along the incident propagation direction of the gravitational wave .",
    "we note in passing that the dynamical lam coefficient @xmath78 for a finite volume system may have frequency @xmath48-poles corresponding to both transverse and longitudinal acoustic modes .",

    "large _ electronic induced detection enhancement ; it is @xmath160 such an enhancement allows for the experimental feasibility of detecting gravitational radiation from sources within our own galaxy .",
    "in this work , we have considered in detail the dynamical response produced in a metallic weber bar by a gravitational wave .",
    "our treatment differs from all previous analyses in several major aspects .",
    "first , departing from tradition , we follow the einstein equations so that a ( transverse , traceless ) gravitational wave is directly coupled to the ( transverse , traceless ) part of the pressure .",
    "secondly , observing that in a metal ( at not too high a temperature ) electrons ( not the phonons ) provide the bulk of the pressure .",
    "previous estimates of the couplings based on direct graviton to resonant phonon conversions need a major revision .",
    "in fact , we find that the electron - hole pair loop contributions significantly renormalize the relevant couplings . we have computed this using a thomas - fermi model with uniform electron density to estimate the average kinetic energy per unit volume of the electrons .",
    "the enhancement factor is found in this way to be @xmath161 .",
    "the true factor is likely to be somewhat higher since the assumption of uniform electron density underestimates the kinetic energy of the localized core electrons .",
    "our results can be employed to explain the solution to a theoretical problem raised by experimental observations with the room temperature resonant detectors of the maryland and rome groups during the sn1987a@xcite . at this time",
    "the rome and maryland detectors showed signals with energy of about 100 k correlated with the observation of the neutrino detectors mont blanc , kamiokande , baksan and imb . using the previous cross - section ,",
    "a @xmath162 signal requires the total conversion into gravitational waves of about one thousand solar masses .",
    "this would be impossible for an original star mass of @xmath163 .",
    "however , with the renormalized detection cross section of this work , each @xmath162 signal requires just one tenth of a solar mass ( still high but energetically possible ) yielding important information on collapse mechanisms .",
    "also the rennormalized cross - section yields a sensible astrophysical interpretation of the recent result concerning experimental coincidences@xcite between the cryogenic resonant detectors explorer ( cern ) and nautilus ( frascati ) .",
