    "in situ observations in the solar wind , in planetary magnetosheaths , in the heliosheaths and in other weakly collisional , generally turbulent astrophysical plasmas show isolated or wave - trains of compressible pressure - balanced structures @xcite .",
    "many of these structures are thought to be generated by the mirror instability driven by the perpendicular particle temperature anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the mirror instability has peculiar features .",
    "it generates nonpropagating modes ( at least in a plasma without differential streaming ) and near threshold the unstable modes appears on fluid scales , i.e. , on large scales with respect to the particle characteristic scales .",
    "on the other hand , the instability is resonant , the resonant particles ( with nearly zero parallel velocities with respect to the ambient magnetic field ) have a strong influence on the instability growth rate @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear properties of the mirror instability are not well understood .",
    "@xcite proposed a nonlinear model for this instability near threshold , based on a reductive perturbative expansion of the vlasov - maxwell equations .",
    "this model extends the mirror dispersion relation by including the dominant nonlinear coupling whose effect is to reinforce the mirror instability . in this approach both the linear and nonlinear properties are strongly sensitive to the details of the proton distribution function @xcite . in the perturbative nonlinear model",
    "the particle distribution is , however , fixed . for bi - maxwellian particle distribution functions",
    "the nonlinear model predicts formation of magnetic depressions / holes at the nonlinear stage of the instability . on the other hand ,",
    "direct numerical simulations typically show generation of magnetic enhancements / humps @xcite .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with expectations based on the energy minimization argument in the simplified framework of usual anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "@xcite attempted to combine the reductive perturbative expansion approach with the quasilinear approximation @xcite .",
    "this combined model leads to a fast deformation of the proton distribution function that modifies the ( sign of the ) nonlinear term , and , consequently , magnetic humps are generated in agreement with fully self - consistent simulations .",
    "the quasilinear approximation is however questionable in the case of coherent structures and , moreover , one expects particle trapping to be important at the nonlinear level of the mirror instability @xcite .    in situ observations in the terrestrial magnetosheath",
    "show that mirror magnetic humps are typically observed in the mirror - unstable plasma whereas in the mirror - stable plasma magnetic holes are more probable @xcite . the two - dimensional hybrid expanding box simulation of a homogeneous plasma system ( with the magnetic field in the simulation box , without turbulent fluctuations but with an expansion that drives the perpendicular temperature anisotropy ( cf .",

    "* ) ) of @xcite predicts that in a high - beta plasma the mirror modes are dominant , and , as the expansion pushes the system to lower betas , the system becomes dominated by the proton cyclotron waves whereas the mirror mode structure continuously disappear .",
    "the mirror modes , however , survive relatively far the stable region where they are ( linearly ) damped ; in the unstable region the mirror modes have the form of magnetic humps and on the way to the stable region they transform to magnetic holes similar to the observations in the terrestrial magnetosheath @xcite .",
    "the transition from humps to holes is not understood but is in agreement with the energetic arguments .",
    "the mirror instability is usually investigated in homogeneous or weakly inhomogeneous plasmas @xcite . behavior of this instability is a strongly turbulent ( and strongly inhomogeneous ) plasma such as the solar wind one is an open problem . as in the case of the oblique fire hose instability",
    "@xcite one expects that the mirror instability coexists with plasma turbulence if it is fast enough to compete with the turbulent cascade . in this paper",
    "we investigate properties of the mirror instability in 2-d expanding box simulation where we include important turbulent plasma motion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ code ] describes the numerical code , section  [ simul ] presents the simulation results , and in section  [ discussion ] we discuss the obtained results .",
    "in this paper we test the relationship between proton kinetic instabilities and plasma turbulence in the solar wind using a hybrid expanding box model that allows to studying self - consistently physical processes at ion scales . in the hybrid expanding box model a constant solar wind radial velocity @xmath0 is assumed .",
    "the radial distance @xmath1 is then @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the initial position and @xmath4 is the initial value of the characteristic expansion time @xmath5 .",
    "transverse scales ( with respect to the radial direction ) of a small portion of plasma , co - moving with the solar wind velocity , increase @xmath6 .",
    "the expanding box uses these co - moving coordinates , approximating the spherical coordinates by the cartesian ones @xcite .",
    "the model uses the hybrid approximation where electrons are considered as a massless , charge neutralizing fluid and ions are described by a particle - in - cell model @xcite .",
