    "as well known the yang - mills gauge field is the geometrical object : a connection on the principal bundle .",
    "the base of this bundle is spacetime and the fibres are structural group . if we include gravity then it acts only on the base of this bundle and this is the einstein - yang - mills theory .",
    "the simplest extension of such 4d gravity is assumption that the gravity acts on total space of the principal bundle .",
    "the relation between two these theories give the following theorem @xcite-@xcite :    let @xmath0 group be the fibre of principal bundle .",
    "then there is the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath0-invariant metrics on the total space @xmath1 and the triples @xmath2 .",
    "where @xmath3 is einstein s pseudo - riemannian metric on the base ; @xmath4 is gauge field of the @xmath0 group ( the nondiagonal components of multidimensional metric ) ; @xmath5 is symmetric",
    "metric on the fibre .",
    "the such multidimensional ( md ) gravity differs from standard md gravity by following manner :    1 .   the extremal dimensions ( fibres of bundle ) are not equivalent to spacetime dimensions , as they make up group .",
    "2 .   any physical fields on the total space of bundle ( including md metric )",
    "can depend only on base ( spacetime ) coordinates .",
    "3 .   in this vacuum theory",
    "the gauge fields appears by natural way as a nondiagonal components of md metric .    in standard md gravity",
    "the gauge field is added as an external matter field .",
    "see , for example @xcite-@xcite , where the spherically symmetric and cosmological solutions are obtained in md gravity coupling with generalized maxwell field . in @xcite an inhomogeneous multidimensional cosmological model with a higher dimensional space - time manifold @xmath6 ( @xmath7 )",
    "are investigated under dimensional reduction to tensor - multi - scalar theories .",
    "( @xmath8 is einstein s spacetime , @xmath9 are internal spaces ) .",
    "we note that the metric on the fibre can have only following view : @xmath10 where conformal factor @xmath11 depends only on spacetime coordinates @xmath12 is euclidean metric ; @xmath13 index on fibre ( internal space ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that the fibre is a symmetrical space ( gauge group ) .",
    "@xmath14 are one - form satisfies maurer - cartan structure equations : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a structural constant of gauge group .",
    "thus , md metric on the total space can be written in the following view : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is multidimensional index on the total space .",
    "hence we have only following independent degrees of freedom : conformal factor @xmath19 and md metric @xmath20 .",
    "varying with respect to these variables leads to the following gravity equations : @xmath21 these equations are einstein s md equations for gravity on the principal bundle in vacuum .",
    "below we consider two cases : spherically symmetric and cosmology solutions .",
    "we remind the solution for @xmath22 kaluza - klein s theory derived in @xcite .",
    "the metric is : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the 5th supplementary coordinate ; @xmath25 are @xmath26 polar coordinates ; @xmath27 is the time .",
    "the solution of @xmath22 einstein s equations is : @xmath28 this solution is the wormhole - like object located between two null surfaces @xmath29 .",
    "we note that this solution is nonsingular in @xmath30 .",
    "really , determinant of this",
    "md metrics is equal to : @xmath31 this is indirect confirmation that multidimensional metrics does nt have singularity on null surface @xmath32 .",
    "also we can say that from einstein s equations follows that @xmath33 and hence @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . at last",
    "it can shown that invariant @xmath36 .    such solution we can name as cutting off wormhole ( wh ) in contrast to standard wh joining two asymptotical flat regions .",
    "we can introduce the euler s angles @xmath37 on fibre ( @xmath38 group ) .",
    "then one - forms @xmath14 can be written as a follows : @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "we see a solution of the form : @xmath41 we choose the `` potentials '' @xmath4 in following monopole - like form : @xmath42 let us introduce tetrads @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 are tetrads indexes ; @xmath46 is @xmath47 minkowski metric .",
    "the input equations are written below in the following form : @xmath48 @xmath47 gravity equations become : @xmath49 here the eqs([3 - 10 - 5 ] ) and ( [ 3 - 10 - 6 ] ) are `` yang - mills '' equations for nondiagonal components of the md metric . for simplicity",
    "we consider @xmath50 case .",
    "this means that we have `` color electrical '' field @xmath51 only ( i=1,2,3 ) . in this case",
    "it is easy to integrate eq.([3 - 10 - 6 ] ) : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the constant of the integration ( `` color electrical '' charge ) .",
    "let us examine the most interesting case when the linear dimensions of fibres @xmath54 are vastly smaller than the space dimension @xmath55 and `` charge '' @xmath53 is sufficiently large : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the throat of the wh .    on this approximation",
    "we deduce the equations system : @xmath58 this system has the following solution : @xmath59 let us define value @xmath60 in which metric has null surfaces . from condition : @xmath61 it follows that : @xmath62 it is easy to verify that @xmath63 @xmath64 by @xmath65 .",
    "this value lies beyond the null surfaces .",
    "this means that the small terms in ( [ 3 - 10 - 1 ] ) , ( [ 3 - 10 - 4 ] ) will stay also small even near the null surfaces .",
    "analogous to spherically symmetric metric ( [ 3 - 6 ] ) we will search the md cosmology metric on the total space as follows : @xmath66 here @xmath67 are euler s angles on @xmath68 ( 3d sphere is spacelike section of universe ) .",
    "we write down the nondiagonal components of md metric in following instanton - like form : @xmath69 after substitution to initial gravity equations ( [ 3 - 9 - 1])-([3 - 9 - 2 ] ) we have : @xmath70 these equations have the following interesting properties . in 4d case friedman - walker - robertson ( frw )",
    "solutions is not the solutions with bouncing off ( they do nt have even though local minimum ) .",
    "let us consider the time moment in which the all functions @xmath71 have the local extreme and analyze this extremum . in this point we have the following expression for @xmath72 and @xmath73 : @xmath74 here sign 0 indicate that the value of corresponding function at @xmath75 is given . from these equations",
    "we see that 3d universe ( time section of 4d base of principal bundle ) has , at least locally , a bouncing off effect in contrast with 4d case .",
    "this leads from the fact that the effective 4d stress - energy tensor derived from metric on extremal dimension evidently violate the strong energy conditions .",
    "the total space of principal bundle behaves as md kasner s universe with expanding space dimensions and contracting extremal dimensions ( at least locally ) .",
    "but unlike to standard md gravity the space coordinates can be only expand and respectively the extremal dimensions ( fibre of principal bundle ) only shrink .    the general solution of eq s ( [ 4 - 3 - 1]-[4 - 3 - 4 ] ) has a singularity .",
    "let us investigate the behaviour of functions @xmath71 near this singularity .",
    "we will search solution in this region in the following form : @xmath76 @xmath77 are some constants .",
    "the simple calculations give us the following results : @xmath78 the initial equations are very difficult for analytical investigations and hence we solve these equations only numerically with following bouncing off initial conditions : @xmath79 without loss of generality we can take @xmath80 .",
    "the condition for @xmath81 follows from initial conditions eq .",
    "( [ 4 - 3 - 4 ] ) : @xmath82 thus , this system has only own independent parameter @xmath83 .",
    "the typically solution of these equations is presented on fig.1 - 3 . from these",
    "fig s we see that our solution has a local bouncing off effect by @xmath75 and singularity by some @xmath84 .",
    "finally , we can to say following : 4d einstein - yang - mills theory and corresponding md gravity on the principal bundle conform to each another in some sense .",
    "but the dynamic of these theories is sufficiently another . in static spherically symmetric case",
    "the 4d einstein - yang - mills theory has solution outside of event horizon ( black hole filled by yang - mills gauge field ref s ( @xcite ) whereas analogously solution in md gravity there is under null surfaces .",
    "further , 4d frw solution does nt have the bouncing off but md gravity on the principal bundle has ( at least locally ) bouncing off effect in general solution .",
    "most likely this take place from the fact that the md gravity on principal bundle can violate the energy conditon .",
