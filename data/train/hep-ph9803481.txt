    "<S> the susy - breaking lagrangian will , ultimately , be determined by the physics of supersymmetry breaking and flavor but at the moment the best approach is to simply parameterize it with a general set of explicitly susy - breaking parameters . a general explicit soft susy - breaking lagrangian @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 for each generation , contains more than 100 new parameters and makes the study of the mssm parameter space completely inviable . </S>",

    "<S> it is important to note that the particle spectra of models with the gmsb are similar to those of the vmssm @xcite and we will , therefore , concentrate our discussion on the vmssm and possible modifications to it .    </S>",
    "<S> the issue we would like to address is how restrictive the vmssm is to collider phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to be able to explore more diverse particle spectra while still satisfying all experimental bounds and keeping the number of parameters small . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we propose a `` less minimal supersymmetric standard model '' ( lmssm ) , which adds only one extra parameter to the vmssm : the fayet  iliopoulos @xmath4-term for the @xmath3 gauge group , @xmath6 . unlike the vmssm </S>",

    "<S> finally , if @xmath78 and @xmath1 is large , the left - handed @xmath8 can become the lsp due to left - right mixing in the mass squared matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to draw attention to the _ existence _ of different particle spectra for different regions in the parameter space rather than the size of those regions ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig ] ) . like the vmssm </S>",
    "<S> , the lmssm should be considered as a parameterization and not a model , and the fact that diverse spectra can occur is what interests us .    </S>",
    "<S> next we discuss interesting aspects of the phenomenology of the spectra outlined above semi - quantitatively .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath8 is the lsp , heavy stable charged particles become a good signature for susy searches . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of this situation was done in the context of models with the gmsb where the @xmath53 is the lsp@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> heavy stable charged particles might be found by looking for an excess of hits in the muon chambers , or tracks with anomalously large @xmath79 in the tracking chambers .    </S>",
    "<S> if the lsp is a higgsino - like neutralino , the phenomenology is very different from the vmssm case , where the lsp is an almost pure b - ino . in this case </S>",
    "<S> there are four fermions relatively close in mass : @xmath54 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which are all higgsino - like . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation experimental searches are much harder . </S>",
    "<S> chargino searches become more difficult because the mass splitting between @xmath81 and @xmath82 becomes very small ( @xmath83 in the limit of @xmath84 ) , and @xmath81 will decay into missing transverse energy ( @xmath85 ) plus low energy leptons or jets ( @xmath86  gev if @xmath87  gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimental searches for chargino signals at the tevatron usually require that @xmath88  gev@xcite .    at hadron machines </S>",
    "<S> the amount of @xmath85 is reduced because of the small coupling between first and second generation squarks and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the main decay mode of a squark is @xmath90 or @xmath91 , and the heavier chargino / neutralinos , which are gaugino - like , further decay via , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the decay chains are therefore much longer and the amount of @xmath85 should decrease . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that there might be a significant increase in the number of top quark , b - jet , and @xmath93 events because of the production of heavy higgs boson states ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) , which have large branching ratios into third generation fermions .    </S>",
    "<S> the clean tri - lepton signature at hadron machines will decrease by an order of magnitude mainly because of the smaller leptonic branching ratio for @xmath80 and @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this effect is not restricted to the pure higgsino - like neutralino limit , but also applies to a mixed @xmath54@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if the lsp is @xmath7 , the decay modes of the heavier particles change dramatically . </S>",
    "<S> there are different possibilities , depending on @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath98 the main decay mode for sleptons is @xmath99 or @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> charginos , on the other hand , decay into two particles , namely @xmath101 or @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> the pair production of two sleptons at an @xmath103 machine will yield , for instance , @xmath104 , which is the typical chargino pair production signal in the vmssm . </S>",
    "<S> the production of a chargino - pair will yield acoplanar leptons plus @xmath105 , which is the typical slepton signal at @xmath103 machines in the vmssm . </S>",
    "<S> the two leptons , however , do not have to be of the same flavor . </S>",
    "<S> there are , of course , ways of distinguishing a slepton signature in the vmssm from the chargino signal in this scenario because the cross sections and angular distributions are quite different .    </S>",
    "<S> another important feature is the visible decay @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the production @xmath107 a feasible susy signature . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore squarks decay dominantly as @xmath108 because @xmath76 is much lighter than @xmath70 or @xmath69 , and hence the squarks produced are dominantly @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> this can lead to a rather impressive four leptons plus jets plus @xmath85 signature at hadron machines . </S>",
    "<S> the total fraction of @xmath109 events is only about 0.5% because typically @xmath110 and @xmath111 for @xmath112 or @xmath1 , but they have much lower backgrounds @xcite .    in the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath113 both the @xmath81 and the @xmath114 decay into two on - shell particles ( @xmath115 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath54 , though unstable , is still invisible , because its only allowed decay mode is @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario has , therefore , four `` virtual lsps '' ( 3 @xmath117 and the @xmath54 ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the amount of @xmath85 in hadron machines is virtually unchanged with respect to the vmssm@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the clean tri - lepton signature is enhanced ( given that @xmath118 is allowed with reasonable branching ratio ) because both the @xmath81 and the @xmath114 always decay into one charged lepton .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , there is another type of signature , which has no vmssm analog , if the sneutrino is the lsp and @xmath119 : visible sneutrino decays , @xmath120 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the first and second generation sneutrinos are heavier than @xmath7 enough to decay visibly . </S>",
    "<S> the other allowed sneutrino decays are @xmath121 and @xmath122 . for @xmath31 , @xmath123(gev)@xmath56 , @xmath124  gev and @xmath125  gev , @xmath126  gev , and </S>",
    "<S> the visible branching ratio is approximately @xmath127% . in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> , there is a very striking signature for @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) production in @xmath130 machines if one of the sneutrinos decays visibly and the other invisibly . </S>",
    "<S> one expects to see @xmath131 plus @xmath85 for @xmath132 of all @xmath133 produced , for the parameters mentioned earlier . </S>",
    "<S> the main backgrounds for this signal are @xmath134 and @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> however , simple kinematic cuts should efficiently suppress these events , because their kinematics are quite different from the signal s . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic study of the appropriate cuts is beyond the scope of this letter . </S>",
    "<S> there is also the possibility that @xmath136 decays with a displaced vertex , if @xmath137 is small enough . in this case , however , the visible branching ratio is significantly smaller because of the phase space reduction due to the tau mass .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the so - called `` minimal supergravity inspired '' supersymmetric standard model is too restrictive as far as collider phenomenology is concerned . </S>",
    "<S> we proposed the addition of only one extra parameter to the vmssm , the fayet  </S>",
    "<S> iliopoulos @xmath4-term for @xmath47 , and showed that it is capable of yielding a much more diverse phenomenology while still satisfying all experimental constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> while the vmssm almost always yields a b - ino - like lsp , our lmssm also allows @xmath117 , @xmath8 or higgsino - like @xmath54 lsp . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that for each one of these cases there are important phenomenological consequences , including new signatures for susy and the disappearance of other `` standard '' signatures . </S>",
    "<S> even though we do not advocate the lmssm as _ the _ model of susy breaking , we emphasize that is a much less restrictive , and yet workable , parameterization of the susy breaking sector . </S>"
