    "the extraordinary success of the _ fermi _ mission marks the beginning of the golden age for gamma - ray astrophysics . with 24 months of data ,",
    "the second _ fermi_-lat catalogue ( 2fgl ) lists 1873 sources in the 100 mev to 100 gev energy range , of which 886 are agns and 108 are pulsars .",
    "while _ fermi _ has greatly mitigated issues inherent to source localisation in the gamma - ray regime , 269 sources in the 2fgl ( 15% of the total ) remain without obvious counterparts at galactic latitude @xmath0 . such failure to associate the entire",
    "_ fermi _ catalogue continues to fuel speculation about the existence of new types of gamma - ray source classes .",
    "probably the most intriguing potential sources of gamma ray emission are dark matter subhaloes @xcite .",
    "numerical cold dark matter ( cdm ) simulations suggest that galaxies like our own are surrounded by a wealth of small dark matter subhaloes that survived structure formation @xcite .",
    "massive subhaloes ( @xmath2 ) would correspond to `` classical '' dwarf galaxies .",
    "less massive ones would be optically elusive and might only be revealed as gamma - ray point sources when weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) annihilate to gamma rays @xcite . as a result , nearby dark matter subhaloes might be lurking among the unassociated _ fermi _ sources at high galactic latitudes .",
    "if found , an annihilation signal from galactic subhaloes would clinch the first non - gravitational signature of dark matter .",
    "the hunt for dark matter subhaloes in the _ fermi _ catalogue is currently underway @xcite .",
    "most approaches involve the hypothesised sharp spectral cut - off or step expected at the wimp mass @xcite . assuming that the wimp mass falls between 100 mev and 50 gev",
    ", a dark matter subhalo could be detectable in the _ fermi _ mev - gev band , but would disappear in the gev - tev band , effectively creating a tev dropout .",
    "here we investigate the possibility of identifying dark matter subhalo candidates using supervised machine learning algorithms . rather than starting with an _ ad hoc _ theoretical dark matter spectrum",
    "we would like to exploit pattern recognition of known gamma - ray features in associated sources and use this information to locate outliers that might constitute novel emitters .",
    "machine learning algorithms have already been used to study the first _ fermi _ lat catalogue ( 1fgl ) .",
    "for example , @xcite investigated classification trees and logistic regression to predict classes of unassociated sources in the 1fgl based on a set of gamma - ray features .",
    "k - means clustering was also applied to help distinguish individual counterparts within _ fermi _ error contours @xcite .    with an additional year of collected _ fermi _ data , the gamma - ray features reported in the 2fgl",
    "have improved substantially . in this paper",
    "we train the random forest classifier @xcite on identified / associated _ fermi _ objects and build a set of decision trees that provide predictions for high - latitude unassociated _ fermi _ objects in the 2fgl .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ datasets ]",
    "we describe the datasets and the random forest algorithm .",
    "section [ appli ] describes the performance of the classifier on unassociated _ fermi _ sources .",
    "section [ subhalos ] details the search for potential outliers .",
    "finally , we provide our conclusions and discuss future work in section [ discuss ] .",
    "random forest is an ensemble classifier that grows a large forest of classification trees @xcite .",
    "decision trees are classification tools that have a tree structure , where each split is based on the information gained considering the elements of the feature space @xcite . to classify a new object , each tree in the forest votes on the class .",
    "the proportion of votes @xmath3 that agree on a decision provides a measure of the accuracy of the classification .",
    "random forest then makes a prediction based on the majority of votes ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "random forest also computes proximities between pairs of objects and produces scaling coordinates ( 1st and 2nd ) that can be used to visualise datasets easily@xcite .",
    "in addition , a number of comparisons have shown that random forest is unexcelled in accuracy among current classifiers @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented here uses the r randomforest package @xcite .        [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]    given that outlyingness values much greater than 10 usually indicate novel cases @xcite , there is no strong indication of novelties ( significant outliers ) among the 37 objects without firm predictions .",
    "we find that the top five outliers have an average flux of @xmath5 ph @xmath6 s@xmath7 ( 1100 gev ) .",
    "unassociated source fluxes at high latitudes range from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ph @xmath6 s@xmath7 .",
    "thus , they are not necessarily the faintest sources in the dataset . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean photon index of sources in table [ table2 ] is @xmath10 , while photon indices in the unassociated sample range from 1.1 to about 3.0 .",
    "inspection of individual features in this manner yields limited insight into what makes these outliers stand out from the rest of the sample . as mentioned before , the exploration of the entire feature space is precisely where the supervised learning algorithm excels .",
    "unfortunately , _",
    "sibyl _ can not assess by itself whether the outlyingness is due to an anomaly in the data taking process , a simple variation within known _ fermi _ classes , or a true novel source class such as dark matter annihilation in galactic subhaloes .",
    "we have presented the outcome of the random forest predictor _ sibyl_.",
    "the results show that machine learning algorithms provide a reasonable route not only to predict unassociated agns / pulsars in the 2fgl , but also to produce a list of sources with unusual features that could be explored as potential dark matter subhalo candidates . after training on 908 identified",
    "/ associated _ fermi _ objects , _ sibyl _ has been applied to predict the class of unassociated _ fermi _ sources in the 2fgl . out of 269 unassociated sources at high latitudes , we have found that 216 are agn candidates and 16 are considered potential pulsars with prediction accuracy rates greater than 96.5@xmath1 .",
    "_ sibyl _ has also produced a list of 37 outlier objects ; however , none of these exhibits significant outlyingness that can be directly connected to new gamma - ray classes ( including dark matter subhaloes ) at this point .",
    "we emphasise again that our results are strict predictions based on pattern recognition and thus a rigourous source identification process will have to localise actual counterparts at other wavelengths .",
    "the results leave some room , albeit very small , to accommodate dark matter subhaloes or alternative source classes in the 2fgl .",
    "these pockets could be targeted to exhaust all possibilities .",
    "looking forward , zooming in on a reduced group of sources might be a wise observational strategy .",
    "for obvious reasons , the set of objects with the largest outlyingness could be a reasonable place to conduct a dedicated survey .",
    "if dark matter consists of particles with a mass below 60 gev @xcite , dark matter subhaloes might also be camouflaging among the ranks of predicted pulsars as their spectral signature could be similar to the pronounced spectral cut - off predicted predicted by certain dark matter models .",
    "however , a number of these sources could be old radio - quiet pulsars which will complicate the search for a counterpart @xcite .",
    "there are a number of issues that need further exploration .",
    "for instance , the predictions are heavily dependent on the robustness of the spectral parameters listed in the 2fgl .",
    "most machine learning algorithms lack a proper treatment of uncertainties in each of the features considered @xcite .",
    "inclusion of uncertainties as individual features in _",
    "sibyl _ did not yield improved performances in our predictions . with additional years of flight ,",
    "_ fermi _ will likely keep improving the accuracy of the gamma - ray features .",
    "however , attempts should be made to account for feature errors properly . in a forthcoming paper , we plan to explore a more refined breakdown into further _",
    ". there are at least four agn subclasses in the 2fgl comprising bl lacs , flat - spectrum radio quasars , misaligned agns , and seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "pulsars can be further partitioned into radio - loud , radio - quiet , and millisecond pulsars @xcite .    ultimately , the main reason that a large _ fermi _ fraction remains unassociated to begin with has to do with the quality of localisations in the gamma - ray band . at faint flux levels , it becomes ever more difficult to associate a _ fermi _ source with a particular counterpart .",
    "the best association procedures rely on positional coincidences and correlations with flat - spectrum radio sources @xcite .",
    "none the less , considering the results presented here and the scatter in gamma - ray flux it seems likely that many of the unassociated sources at high latitude are agns or mid - latitude pulsars with somewhat fainter radio fluxes than their brighter cousins .    without a major breakthrough in localisations ,",
    "the actual counterparts of most unassociated _ fermi _ objects will be difficult to pinpoint in the short term .",
    "machine learning algorithms can help narrow the options .",
    "eventually , we will see significant improvement in localisations , particularly for galactic sources , courtesy of the future cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) that will achieve enhanced angular resolution above 25 gev @xcite .",
