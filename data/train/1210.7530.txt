    "in the first four decades since their discovery , pulsars were almost the exclusive domain of radio ( and to a lesser extent x - ray ) astronomy .",
    "indeed , of the @xmath12000 known pulsars , the majority were discovered in radio . since june 2008 ,",
    "however , with the launch of the lat , on the _ fermi _ satellite , @xmath0-rays have become a viable means of discovering ( and studying ) pulsars .",
    "more important than the number of lat - detected pulsars ( a small fraction of the overall population ) , the lat sample is subject to different biases than the radio sample .",
    "lat pulsars are typically nearby ( @xmath1few kpc ) and energetic ( @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) , and a large fraction are _ radio - quiet_. furthermore , @xmath0-rays , unlike the radio beams , carry a significant fraction of the rotational energy of pulsars , thus providing a powerful probe into these extreme objects .",
    "finally , lat pulsars provide a crucial input into our understanding of the overall neutron star population of the galaxy .",
    "the lat is a pair conversion telescope consisting of a tracker , a calorimeter , and a segmented anti - coincidence detector , along with a programmable trigger and a complex data acquisition system . by incorporating the latest advances from particle physics '' . ] , including the use of silicon - strip detectors , the lat has achieved a giant leap in capabilities compared to its predecessor , egret .",
    "the lat extends to higher energies ( @xmath4300 gev vs @xmath110 gev ) , has a larger effective area and field of view , improved angular and energy resolutions , and much lower deadtime ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* atwood et al . 2009 ) ) . in its first 4 years of operations ,",
    "the lat has collected @xmath4200 million `` source '' class events , compared to @xmath11.5 million photons collected by egret , in its 9-year lifetime .",
    "regarding pulsars , the progress made by the lat has been spectacular .",
    "the @xmath0-ray pulsar population has grown from 7 firm detections ( plus a few candidates ) at the time of the _ fermi _ launch ( ( * ? ? ? * thompson 2008 ) ) , to 117 detections in three years of lat survey observations ( the second _ fermi_-lat catalog of @xmath0-ray pulsars , _ in preparation _ ) . beyond the jump in the number of pulsars , the increased statistics enable detailed ( e.g. phase - resolved ) studies on individual pulsars , previously out of reach .",
    "the lat has also opened up the unexplored 10100 gev window .",
    "egret detected a mere handful of @xmath410 gev photons from the brightest pulsars ( ( * ? ? ? * thompson 2005 ) ) , whereas the lat detects significant emission from over two dozen pulsars in this energy range and even @xmath425 gev events from the brightest ones ( e.g. crab , vela , geminga , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* saz parkinson 2012 ) ) .    of the 117 lat detections ,",
    "61 pulsars were known prior to _",
    "fermi_. pulsations were obtained by folding the @xmath0-rays with a radio ( or x - ray ) timing model .",
    "of these 61 , 20 are msps ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* abdo et al . 2009c ) ) , a hitherto unknown class of strong @xmath0-ray emitters .",
    "more surprisingly , a large number of msps ( @xmath440 ) were discovered in radio searches of lat unassociated sources ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ray et al . 2012 ) ) .",
    "most ( 20 so far , e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ransom et al . 2011 ) ) will likely exhibit @xmath0-ray pulsations - ray sources selected precisely for their _ pulsar - like _ qualities .",
    "] , once enough data and/or a precise timing model is obtained ( usually from radio observations ) .",
    "finally , 36 of the 117 @xmath0-ray pulsars were discovered directly in blind searches of lat data ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the rest of this paper discusses the challenges , results , and prospects of these searches .",
    "two factors make @xmath0-ray searches for pulsars particularly challenging , compared to radio searches .",
    "the first involves the scarcity of events .",
    "the lat detects @xmath11 @xmath0-ray per day from a typical ( bright ) pulsar .",
    "this means that lat searches for pulsars span months to years ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the second complication involves the broad , energy - dependent psf of the instrument ( from @xmath5 at 100 mev to @xmath6 at 100 gev , 68% containment , normal incidence ) .",
    "this results in significant source confusion , especially in high background regions like the galactic plane , where the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission makes it hard to resolve individual sources .",
    "essentially , it is impossible to select , with certainty , events coming from a source , so maximum likelihood techniques must be employed . using these techniques ,",
    "it is possible to determine the probability that each event is coming from the source of interest and improve the sensitivity of the search by assigning a weight to each event equal to this probability ( * ? ? ?",

    "many of these early @xmath0-ray pulsars discovered by the lat are coincident with old egret unidentified sources .",

    "radio follow - up observations of the lat - discovered pulsars showed that most of them are _ radio - quiet _",
    "( or extremely radio - faint ) , suggesting that the @xmath0-ray emission originates far from the neutron star surface , resulting in broad beams .",
    "it is now clear that these radio - quiet @xmath0-ray pulsars represent a significant fraction of the neutron star population of the galaxy ( see guillemot et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , in these proceedings , for a detailed review of the radio observations of lat @xmath0-ray pulsars ) .",
    "all 36 pulsars found in lat blind searches to date are young ( @xmath7 yr ) energetic ( @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 erg s@xmath3 ) pulsars with frequencies below @xmath120 hz .",
    "these pulsars often exhibit timing irregularities , in the form of _ timing noise _ and glitches .",
    "since most are not detected in radio , the lat is the only instrument capable of timing them ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ray et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "while it is possible to time these noisy ( or `` glitchy '' ) pulsars , a good timing model often requires many frequency derivatives and other whitening terms , making their _ discovery _ over long data spans extremely challenging .",
    "searches for these pulsars may only be possible over lat observing periods lasting @xmath1months , rather than years ( see figure 2 ) .          as mentioned above , the discovery of @xmath0-ray msps ( ( * ? ?",
    "* abdo et al . 2009c ) ) was largely unexpected .",
    "equally unexpected was the large number of msps discovered by radio telescopes searching lat unassociated sources ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ray et al .",
    "this fact , combined with the large fraction of _ radio - quiet _ young pulsars , raises the question of whether large large numbers of _ radio - quiet _ @xmath0-ray msps remain to be discovered in blind searches of lat data .",
    "the answer , from examining the identified @xmath0-ray sources in the _ almost _ flux - limited _",
    "fermi_-lat bright source list ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* abdo et al . 2009a ) ) , appears to be no . whereas at least two thirds of young @xmath0-ray pulsars are _",
    "radio quiet _",
    ", at most one third of @xmath0-ray msps are ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* romani 2012 ) ) .",
    "blind searches for msps are vastly more complicated than searches for young pulsars .",
    "firstly , a majority ( @xmath180% ) of msps are in binary systems , and a full blind search over unknown orbital parameters is out of reach given current computer capabilities .",
    "searches for isolated msps are possible , but the high frequencies increase the memory and cpu requirements .",
    "positional uncertainties become more relevant with increasing frequencies and the typical tolerance of a blind search using several years of data is of order a fraction of an arc second .",
    "this means that one must either perform a fine scan over the lat positions , or else identify a precise position of a plausible counterpart , using multi - wavelength ( e.g. x - ray ) observations .",
    "a number of lat sources have been identified as promising pulsar candidates , by virtue of their variability and spectral properties ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ackermann et al . 2012 ) ) .",
    "more recently , x - ray and optical studies of some of the brightest of these have identified some strong `` black widow '' candidates : eclipsing binary msps with very compact , almost circular orbits , where the pulsar is destroying its low - mass companion ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* romani & shaw 2011 , romani 2012 ) ) .",
    "these studies derive extremely precise positions ( to @xmath10 ) and stringent constraints on two out of the three requisite orbital parameters ( leaving only the projected semi - axis relatively unconstrainted ) .",
    "thus , for the first time , searches for such binary msps using @xmath0-ray data are possible .",
    "a deep lat search of 2fgl j2339.6 + 0532 ( the most promising of these `` black widow '' candidates ) unfortunately produced no significant candidate , but further efforts are in progress ( see belfiore ( 2012 ) for details ) .",
    "understanding the @xmath0-ray emission from the galactic center ( gc ) region is both challenging and controversial .",
    "claims that @xmath0-ray emission from the gc may be related to dark matter ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hooper & goodenough 2011 , weniger 2012 ) ) should be measured up against more conventional explanations , such as a possible origin from @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "as a site of massive star formation , it likely contains thousands of pulsars , but their radio detection is hampered by the large amount of interstellar scattering .",
    "nevertheless , some pulsars have been discovered fairly close to the gc , and predictions for the number of radio pulsars that could be associated with the gc range in the thousands ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* deneva et al . 2009 ) ) .",
    "it is possible that some of the undiscovered pulsars in the region are _ radio quiet _",
    ", like the majority of young pulsars found in lat blind searches ( e.g. psr j1732 - 3131 , see figure 3 ) .",
    "blind searches for @xmath0-ray pulsars around the gc are affected by low fluxes ( due to the large distance ) , and high levels of diffuse emission . indeed , most lat pulsars are likely nearby ( @xmath1few kpc ) .",
    "the lat has , however , detected pulsations from msp j1823 - 3021a , in the globular cluster ngc 6624 , at 8.4 kpc ( roughly the distance to the gc ) .",
    "it is possible to estimate how far blind searches might be sensitive out to . from scaling arguments , considering that the @xmath0-ray flux of the crab is several thousand times brighter than the faintest @xmath0-ray pulsar discovered in a blind search ,",
    "we conclude that it is possible to discover a _",
    "crab - like _ @xmath0-ray pulsar in a lat blind search out to at least @xmath115 kpc .",
    "perhaps the biggest complication in searching for faint pulsars around the gc is the fact that such a pulsar may be young and _ noisy _ ( or `` glitchy '' ) .",
    "as described above , the loss of coherence of the signal limits the amount of data that can be effectively searched ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "thus , regardless of the number of years of lat data available , it may only be possible to search several months at a time .",
    "thus , the sensitivity of searches in this region may only improve significantly with improvements in reconstruction ( e.g. pass 8 , see baldini ( 2011 ) , _ fermi _ symposium ) , or a change in the observing mode . for the first four years of its mission ,",
    "_ fermi _ has operated mostly in survey mode .",
    "this has many advantages for most of the scientific goals of the mission , including pulsar searches ( and timing ) . modifying the observing profile , however ,",
    "could enhance the sensitivity to detection of faint signals ( both from pulsars and/or dark matter ) from the gc .",
    "figure 3 ( right ) shows the relative gain in exposure ( compared to survey mode ) with a modified mode in which the lat points to a location slightly offset from the gc . whenever the gc is occulted , the lat could go back into survey mode , thus maintaining some level of exposure over the entire sky .    3 , while the exposure for other parts of the sky decreases to roughly one third , in the worst case . , title=\"fig : \" ] 3 , while the exposure for other parts of the sky decreases to roughly one third , in the worst case . , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the nasa senior review recently recommended that _ fermi _ operations continue through 2016 . in principle , _ fermi _ could continue to operate well beyond this date .",
    "as the lat accumulates more data , it will detect @xmath0-ray pulsations from ever fainter _ radio - loud _ pulsars .",
    "as for blind searches of @xmath0-ray data , they too will continue to produce new discoveries , although the increasing computational demands will require additional resources ( e.g. einstein@home[multiblock footnote omitted ] ) and efficient computational techniques to exploit them .",
    "finally , multi - wavelength observations ( radio , x - rays , and optical ) , will continue to play a crucial role in lat pulsar studies , especially in facilitating the search for more exotic pulsar systems , such as `` black widow '' systems , young binary pulsars , and pulsars around the gc . in this last case , a modified observing profile enhancing the exposure to this region ( by a factor of @xmath13 )",
    "could play a crucial role in future discoveries .",
    "the @xmath11 lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include nasa and doe in the united states , cea / irfu and in2p3/cnrs in france , asi and infn in italy , mext , kek , and jaxa in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the national space board in sweden . additional support from inaf in italy and cnes in france for science analysis during the operations phase is also gratefully acknowledged .",
