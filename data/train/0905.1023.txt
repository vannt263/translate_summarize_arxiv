    "one of the most important developments in experiments on ultra - cold atoms is the observation of bec - bcs crossover @xcite which was originally predicated for strongly - coupled superconductors @xcite . in experiments on ultra - cold atoms ,",
    "the interaction between atoms can be tuned by the technique of feshbach resonance , and the system can evolve smoothly from a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pairing state to a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) state of diatomic molecules . in the bcs limit where the interaction is weakly attractive ,",
    "the atoms are paired into a bcs state below a critical temperature , very similar to electrons in conventional superconductors . in the bec limit where the interaction is weakly repulsive ,",
    "tightly - bound diatomic molecules are formed , and a molecular bec state appears below a critical temperature . near the resonance , in the unitary region @xcite where the size of the scattering length is much larger than the inter - particle spacing ,",
    "the system is strongly correlated in both the normal and superfluid states .",
    "the bec - bcs crossover can be qualitatively explained by a mean - field bcs theory @xcite . in this theory , the size of atom pairs decreases as the system goes from the bcs side to the bec side . in the bec limit ,",
    "the pair size is so small that atom pairs become diatomic molecules .",
    "however , the mean - field theory predicts an exponentially - divergent superfluid transition temperature in the bec limit @xcite , which is against the result from the theory about an ideal bose gas .",
    "nozires and schmitt - rink ( nsr ) @xcite first pointed out that the pairing fluctuation must be taken into account to obtain the correct superfluid transition temperature @xmath0 of the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "the pairing fluctuation is especially important in the bec limit where nearly all atoms become thermal molecules at @xmath0 .",
    "following nsr s pioneer work , many theoretical studies have focused on improving nsr s method and extending their analysis to the broken symmetry state @xcite , which was recently reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however in the bcs limit , a different type of fluctuation is important .",
    "gorkov and melik - barkhudarov ( gmb ) @xcite found that there is a modification to the pairing interaction due to the many - body medium , referred to as the induced interaction @xcite .",
    "the induced interaction suppresses pairing considerably and reduces the superfluid transition temperature @xmath0 by a factor about @xmath1 with respect to the mean - field @xmath0 in the bcs limit .",
    "the fluctuation considered by gmb is in the particle - hole channel , different from that in the particle - particle channel considered by nsr . in the bcs limit",
    "the nsr fluctuation is much less important than the gmb fluctuation .",
    "when the system moves from the bcs side towards the bec side , the gmb fluctuation becomes weaker and the nsr fluctuation becomes stronger . in the bec limit ,",
    "the nsr fluctuation is dominant . in an accurate description of the bec - bcs crossover",
    ", both gmb and nsr fluctuations should be treated properly , which has not been addressed except in two recent renormalization - group studies @xcite .    ) .",
    "these theoretical results are compared with the data from qmc simulations @xcite shown in symbols.,width=321 ]    in this work , we present our result about the induced interaction in the whole bec - bcs crossover .",
    "first we extend the gmb theory about the induced interaction from the bcs limit to the strongly - interacting region .",
    "then we consider the induced interaction in the nsr framework and compute @xmath0 for the entire bec - bcs crossover .",
    "our main result is shown in fig .",
    "[ tc ] . compared with the original nsr result ,",
    "the superfluid transition temperature @xmath0 is reduced considerably both on the bcs side and in the unitary region . in the bcs limit",
    ", we recover the gmb result . at unitarity",
    ", the critical temperature @xmath0 is found to be @xmath2 , close to the results from quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations @xcite , and about 20% smaller than the nsr result .",
    "our result shows that induced interaction plays an important role in the unitary region and on the bcs side .",
    "discussions and conclusions are given in the end .",
    "a fermi gas with a wide feshbach resonance can be described by a single - channel model , @xmath3 where the coupling constant is given by @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the scattering length , and @xmath6 is the field operator for spin component @xmath7 . in this work ,",
    "we consider only the homogeneous spin - balanced case where the densities of spin-@xmath8 and spin-@xmath9 atoms are the same .    in the bcs limit when the interaction is weakly attractive , gorkov and melik - barkhudarov ( gmb ) @xcite showed that in the particle - hole channel there is a correction to the pairing interaction from the many - body background , given by the feynman diagram shown in fig .",

    "( [ tc - eq ] ) with that in the bcs mean - field theory , the effect of the induced interaction is equivalent to making the scattering length larger . in the bcs limit , the induced interaction leads to a reduction of @xmath0 from the mean - field result , as given in eq .",

    "@xcite and @xmath76 @xcite in renormalization group studies . compared with the original nsr result , our critical temperature is about 20% lower , implying that the induced interaction still plays an important role in the unitary region .",
    "the chemical potential at @xmath67 in our results is @xmath77 , higher than qmc results , @xmath78 @xcite and @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "our results can probably be improved by self - consistently taking into account the self energy in the computations of the induced interaction and @xmath52-matrix .",
