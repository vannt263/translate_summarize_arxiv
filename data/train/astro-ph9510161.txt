    "pixel lensing , gravitational microlensing of unresolved stars , was first proposed by crotts ( 1992 ) and baillon et al .",
    "classical lensing experiments are restricted to monitoring only fields of resolvable stars , e.g. ,  toward the galactic bulge and magellanic clouds ( alcock et al .",
    "1995 ; udalski et al .  1995 ; ansari et al .  1995",
    "; alard et al .",
    "by contrast , pixel lensing can overcome this restriction and thus can extend our ability to probe both galactic and extragalactic massive compact objects ( machos ) .",
    "currently , both groups have demonstrated the technique by detecting various types of variable stars ( ansari et al .",
    "1996 ; tomaney & crotts 1996 )    for classical lensing , the light curve is obtained by subtracting the reference flux , @xmath5 , from the amplified flux , @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the flux of the lensed star after ( or before ) being lensed and @xmath9 is the residual flux from stars not participating in the event .",
    "the amplification is related to the lensing parameters by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the inverse einstein ring crossing time , @xmath12 is the angular impact parameter in units of angular einstein ring radius , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the time of maximum amplification .",
    "the angular einstein ring radius is related to the physical einstein ring radius , @xmath15 , and to the physical parameters of the macho by @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the distances between the observer , source , and lens , and @xmath20 is the mass of the lens . on the other hand ,",
    "it is impossible to measure directly the absolute values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 for the case of pixel lensing because stars can not be resolved .",
    "however , the light curve , @xmath21 , still can be obtained by subtracting the reference image from the image in which a lensing event is occurring .",
    "due to its characteristic differences from classical microlensing observations , additional analysis is required to estimate the pixel lensing event rate . for classical lensing ,",
    "an event with modest maximum amplification ( e.g. , @xmath22 ) can often be detected with high signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath23 , when observed for a few minutes on a 1 m telescope .",
    "this is partly because source stars are nearby , and thus bright , and partly because the residual flux , @xmath24 , is moderate or negligible .",
    "note , however , that @xmath24 is not exactly zero due to the blending of star light in dense fields . for the case of pixel lensing , however , stars are located relatively far away , and thus yield low signal .",
    "additionally , the signal suffers from significant noise from background stars that are not being lensed .",
    "therefore , the event detection rate per observed star is significantly lower than that from classical lensing and thus events can be detected only when either the amplification or the intrinsic flux is very high .",
    "however , the loss of detection rate per star is compensated by the fact that many more stars are monitored .",
    "therefore , one can obtain an equivalent number of total detectable events to that of classical lensing experiments .    in this paper ,",
    "i show that one can detect pixel lensing events at a rate @xmath25 with a dedicated 1 m telescope and a @xmath26 ccd . among the events ,",
    "@xmath1 events have high enough @xmath23 to measure the time scale at the 20% level",
    ". the rate can be increased by up to a factor @xmath27 by employing a few improved observational strategies , and thus @xmath28 with measurable time scale could be detected per year .",
    "these strategies are discussed in   7 .",
    "gould ( 1996 ) developed a general formalism for the analysis of pixel lensing .",
    "the reader is referred to this work for a better understanding of the formalism that i use without detailed derivation .",
    "comparison of the formalism with that developed by colley ( 1995 ) is also recommended .",

    "if the observations are carried out for 4 hrs every night and the camera can detect @xmath34 , then @xmath35 day and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the mean exposure time per day .",
    "individual images obtained during the whole event are combined , yielding the total signal - to - noise ratio @xmath38 ^ 2 . \\eqno(2.2)\\ ] ] by converting the sum @xmath39 ^ 2 $ ] into an integral @xmath40 ^ 2 $ ] , one can obtain a compact form of @xmath23 , @xmath41 ^ 2 \\over   \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } dt ( \\omega^2 t^2 + \\beta^2)^{-1 } } , \\eqno(2.3)\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath42 is evaluated and shown in figure 1 of gould ( 1996 ) .",
    "events are detected either when the star is bright or the amplification is high .",
    "this can be quantified by setting a maximum impact parameter @xmath43 within which a lensing event with flux @xmath6 is detected for a certain threshold signal - to - noise ratio @xmath44 .",
    "the maximum impact parameter is then found by solving equation ( 2.3 ) , i.e. , @xmath43 is the solution of the equation @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the inverse of median einstein time scale .",
    "once @xmath43 is determined , the event rate per angular area @xmath47 is computed by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the optical depth , @xmath50 is the luminosity function ( hereafter lf ) of m31 bulge stars , and @xmath51 is a normalization factor , @xmath52^{-1}$ ] .",
    "for the computation of the event rate , it is necessary to compute the optical depth [ see eq .  ( 2.5 ) ] .",
    "the computation of optical depth toward m31 requires some geometrical transformations since m31 is highly inclined , @xmath53 ( kent 1989 ) .",
    "i define the intrinsic coordinates , @xmath54 , that are centered at the center of m31 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are measured along and normal to the disk plane , respectively .",
    "these coordinates are related to another set of coordinates , @xmath57 , which have the same center but are measured along the projected major , minor axis , and the line - of - sight , by , @xmath58^{1/2},\\   z = | y ' \\sin i - z ' \\cos i | .",
    "$ ] the adopted distance to m31 is @xmath59 .",
    "there are several populations of lenses when stars in the m31 bulge are monitored .",
    "the first is machos in the galactic halo .",
    "the mean optical depth to a single m31 star lensed by the galactic halo machos is @xmath60 where @xmath61 . for the galactic halo matter distribution ,",
    "i adopt a modified isothermal sphere with a core radius @xmath62 ; @xmath63 where the normalization is @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the solar galactocentric distance , and the core radius is @xmath66 ( bahcall , schmidt , & soneira 1983 ) .",
    "the value of the galactic core radius is uncertain , but it hardly affects the optical depth determination because m31 is located @xmath67 away from the galactic center . with this model ,",
    "i find @xmath68 .",
    "the second lens population is the machos in the m31 halo .",
    "since the rotation curve of m31 is flat at large radii up to @xmath69 from the center ( kent 1989a ) , the m31 halo is modeled by a standard isothermal model with a core radius @xmath70 ; @xmath71 where the core radius is determined from the relation @xmath72 with the total core mass of @xmath73 ( see below ) and the m31 rotation velocity of @xmath74 , i find that @xmath75 .",
    "then the optical depth contributed by m31 halo lenses is computed similarly to equation ( 3.1 ) , and results in @xmath76 .",
    "finally , the rest of the optical depth toward the m31 bulge is contributed by the m31 disk+bulge self - lensing events .",
    "this contribution of optical depth is computed by @xmath77^{-1 } , \\eqno(3.5)\\ ] ] where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the m31 disk and bulge densities , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the lower and upper boundaries of mass distribution along the line of sight . the m31 bulge is modeled as an oblate spheroid with its ( unnormalized ) matter density as a function of semimajor axis provided by kent ( 1989b ) .",
    "the best - fitting value of the axis ratio , @xmath83 , is found by fitting the computed surface brightness ( corrected for @xmath84 extinction ) to a @xmath4-band image of m31 bulge ( see   5 for the observations ) . in the central region where the m31 bulge mass dominates ,",
    "the rotation velocity is @xmath85 .",
    "thus i normalize the total m31 bulge mass within @xmath86 kpc by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the adopted rotation speed of the galaxy and galactic bulge mass within @xmath86 kpc ( zhao , spergel , & rich 1995 ) .",
    "this normalization procedure results in @xmath90 , which is in reasonable agreement with the determined value of @xmath91 by kent ( 1989b ) . the m31 bulge is cut off at @xmath92 .",
    "the m31 disk is modeled by the double exponential disk , i.e. , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the normalization , and the radial and vertical scale heights are @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively ( gilmore et al .",
    "1990 ; gould 1994 ) .",
    "this results in @xmath97 .",
    "the resulting optical depth distribution caused by m31 population ( m31 disk+bulge self - lensing plus m31 halo ) is shown as a contour map in figure 1 . the total optical depth both by m31 and galactic halo lenses are obtained by adding @xmath68 to the values marked on the contour .",
    "the contour levels are marked on the map in units of @xmath98 .",
    "i note that the determined optical depth is subject to many uncertainties , especially in the mass distributions . for example , braun ( 1991 ) has argued that there is no need to invoke a massive dark halo component . instead of a halo ,",
    "his model has higher disk and bulge densities , c.f . ,",
    "@xmath99 and @xmath100 within 30 kpc from the center .",
    "pixel lensing experiments may resolve the conflicts in the matter density distribution in m31 from the comparison between the theoretical predictions and future observational result .",
    "not only the optical depth but also the median time scale is required for the computation of the event rate . the time scale is determined by the combination of both the transverse speed , @xmath101 , and the einstein ring radius of the lens , i.e. , @xmath102 . the transverse velocity is related to the lens geometry and velocity of the source , @xmath103 , the lens , @xmath104 , and observer , @xmath105 by @xmath106 .",
    "\\eqno(4.1)\\ ] ] for m31-m31 self - lensing events , one can approximate equation ( 4.1 ) as @xmath107 since @xmath108 .",
    "then the rms transverse velocity is found by @xmath109 because the cross - term @xmath110 .",
    "here @xmath111 , and @xmath112 is the adopted velocity dispersion of the m31 bulge ( lawrie 1983 ) .",
    "the einstein ring radius is related to the location of the lens system by @xmath113 , assuming all lenses have the same mass . in the computation ,",
    "i assume @xmath114 because the most probable lens population is low mass stars . for other masses @xmath115 .",
    "the probability of finding an event located at a certain location @xmath116 is found by @xmath117 then the time scale probability distribution is computed from @xmath118 by @xmath119 p(d ) .",
    "\\eqno(4.3)\\ ] ] i find @xmath120 by taking the median value of @xmath121 .",
    "the resulting median time scale @xmath120 for m31 self - lensing events as a function of position @xmath122 shown in units of days in figure 2 as a contour map . for other population events ,",
    "i.e. , galactic halo and m31 halo events , the time scale distributions are similar to that of m31 self - lensing events ( han & gould 1996b ) .",
    "the light from the m31 bulge suffers some extinction by dust in the disk because half the m31 bulge lies in front of the m31 disk while the other half lies behind it .",
    "hence the bulge light from behind the disk is affected by the dust . by experiencing extinction",
    ", the apparent lf of the stars behind the disk will be different from that of stars in front , and thus @xmath123 is affected by the extinction [ see eq .  ( 2.5 ) ] .",
    "since the disk is tilted , the total light of stars influenced by the extinction differs from position to position .    to quantify the amount of extinction , ccd images in @xmath4 and @xmath124 bands",
    "were obtained on the night of 1995 august 4 using tek2k detector on 1-m united sates naval observatory ritchey chrtien aplanatic telescope , with a plate scale of @xmath125 .",
    "the @xmath124 band filter is centered at @xmath126 and has a band width of @xmath127 .",
    "bias and sky subtraction of the images were carried out using the interactive data reduction package iraf .",
    "i find that the disk of m31 is quite transparent .",
    "let @xmath128 and @xmath129 be the surface brightnesses contributed by stars located behind and in front of the disk , respectively .",
    "then the flux ratio between two bands is given by @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the fraction of light that passes through the disk in each band .",
    "let @xmath132 be the ( instrumental ) ratio of flux in the two bands in the absence of extinction .",
    "this quantity can be determined by measuring the photon counts along the far minor axis where nearly all of the bulge is in front of the disk and where , consequently , extinction has almost no effect on the color .",
    "then , one can rewrite equation ( 5.1 ) as @xmath133 the fraction @xmath134 is related to @xmath135 by @xmath136 which implies more absorption in @xmath4 band , i.e. , @xmath137 .",
    "the surface brightnesses , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , are computed from the mass model in   3 and the color ratio @xmath138",
    "is obtained from the images of the m31 bulge .",
    "then @xmath139 is determined by solving equation ( 5.2 ) numerically using the relation ( 5.3 ) , i.e. , by finding the solution of the equation , @xmath140 in general , equation ( 5.4 ) has two solutions , e.g. , for @xmath141 both @xmath142 ( totally opaque ) and @xmath143 ( totally transparent ) solutions are possible .",
    "for the actual data , one set of solutions has @xmath144 , while the other set has @xmath145 .",
    "if @xmath146 , the m31 bulge surface brightness distribution would be extremely asymmetric with respect to the photometric major axis because most of the light would be extinguished on the near side while only a small fraction would be lost on the far side due to the high inclination of m31 .",
    "in fact , the isophotes are close to symmetric .",
    "the mean extinction is therefore @xmath147 .",
    "because the disk is optically thin , the overall event rate depends only on the mean extinction .",
    "i therefore adopt the simplified model of uniform extinction with @xmath148 , which corresponds to @xmath149 .",
    "the event rate formula in equation ( 2.5 ) is derived under the assumption that the dominant form of noise comes from source stars , i.e. , the poisson photon noise @xmath150 . however , except in the central region , @xmath151 , most of the m31 bulge region has a surface brightness less than the sky brightness , which is @xmath152 averaged over the phases of the moon .",
    "therefore , the noise due to the sky - background , @xmath153 , becomes important .",
    "in addition , the differences in psf from image to image taken at different times cause extra noise ( gould 1996 ) , which i denote @xmath154 .",
    "i define the additional factors in noise due to sky and psf variation by @xmath155 the values of these factors are computed by @xmath156^{1/2 } , \\eqno(6.1.2)\\ ] ] where @xmath157 and @xmath158 are the surface brightnesses of the sky and m31 , @xmath159 is the rate of photon detection at the fluctuation magnitude , @xmath160 for m31 ( tonry , 1991 ) , @xmath161 is the fractional difference in seeing between images , and @xmath162 is the number of sub - exposures in each exposure time @xmath37 . by dividing the total exposure time into smaller exposures , the noise due to the time variation of psf decreases because @xmath154 is averaged out , while @xmath150 remains the same . as a result of the additional noise , the total noise , @xmath163 , is increased relative to the pure m31 photon noise by a factor , @xmath164 the net influence of additional noise on the event rate is that the required @xmath44 increases by the factor @xmath165",
    ".    however , not all the events that satisfy the strict @xmath44 test qualify as detectable events .",
    "additional tests await for them .",
    "one of these tests comes from the duration of an event : if the event lasts for very short time , the event could not be detected however high the @xmath23 is , because the event continues less than the observation interval ( 1 day ) .",
    "this restriction of time scale is quantified in the computation by counting only events with @xmath166 , where the effective duration time is defined by @xmath167 ( gould 1995 ) .",
    "some of these short events might occur during the observation which continues for @xmath168 each night in average .",
    "however , they would not be detected because of another restriction discussed below .",
    "the other restriction comes from the finite size of the source star .",
    "if the source size is bigger than the einstein ring , @xmath169 , the point - source amplification formula in equation ( 1.2 ) is no longer valid at the central region of the light curve , i.e. , when @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the crossing time over the star with a radius @xmath172 .",
    "then the maximum amplification will be overestimated by equation ( 1.2 ) and the event with @xmath173 can not be detected ( gould 1995 ) .",
    "the luminosity at a certain frequency @xmath174 is @xmath175 , where @xmath176 $ ] is the planck function . in the rayleigh - jeans limit ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath177 band @xmath178 , the planck function is approximated by @xmath179 , and thus the luminosity in the @xmath177 band is related to the stellar radius by @xmath180 . here",
    "the frequency is regarded constant over a narrow band .",
    "since the temperature of relevant source star varies within a narrow range , @xmath181 , relative to the luminosity , @xmath182 , the dominant factor in determining stellar radius is the luminosity .",
    "therefore , one can approximate the stellar radius by @xmath183 , where the solar @xmath177-band luminosity is @xmath184 and @xmath177-band lf are provided from the model lf discussed in   6.2 .",
    "i begin by analyzing the event rate in a relatively modest observing program .",
    "the experiment is carried out using a @xmath185 ccd camera with a pixel scale of @xmath186 on a 1 m telescope .",
    "if the pixel scale is too big , the geometric alignment of the images would introduce considerable additional noise ( pixelization error ; gould 1996 ) .",
    "i assume that the camera can detect @xmath187 for an @xmath188 star .",
    "the observation is carried out @xmath189 during the m31 season ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "bad weather will influence the event rate , e.g. , by degrading the @xmath23 and by missing portions of the light curve .",
    "however , the weather pattern is unpredictable and differs dramatically from site to site .",
    "hence , i set the observation time less than what might be being carried out ( @xmath191 ) to compensate the loss of @xmath123 by the bad weather instead of modeling the weather pattern . the total exposure time is subdivided into smaller integration times , @xmath192 , so that the images are not saturated",
    "the angular size of the psf is @xmath193 , assuming typical seeing of @xmath194 .",
    "the fractional seeing difference is kept to @xmath195 by using methods discussed in   7 .",
    "the surface brightness distribution is based on the density models of the m31 bulge and disk and then normalized to the values of walterbos et al .",
    "the lf is modeled primarily by adopting that of galactic bulge stars shown by dotted line in the second panel of figure 3 ( j.  frogel , private communication )    however , the lf in the faint end , @xmath196 , is incomplete .",
    "here @xmath197 corresponds to @xmath198 where the lf begins to decline .",
    "if the lf is adopted without corrections , the fraction of bright stars would be overestimated .",
    "the net effect is then the systematic overestimation of event rate because events are more likely to be detected for brighter stars .",
    "thus , i model the faint part of the lf ( @xmath196 ) by adopting the lf of stars in the solar neighborhood determined by wielen , jahreiss , & krger ( 1983 ) for @xmath199 and by gould , bahcall , & flynn ( 1996 ) for @xmath200 . the corrected model lf yields the fluctuation magnitude of @xmath201 , which matches well with tonry s ( 1991 ) determination of @xmath202 before the extinction correction .",
    "the fraction of light from the stars in the corrected part of the lf ( @xmath203 ) is @xmath204 .",
    "the model lf is shown with a solid line in the second panel of figure 3 .",
    "combining all this information , the values of @xmath43 are computed for a given stellar flux @xmath6 by solving equation ( 2.4 ) and taking the additional noise term @xmath165 into consideration .",
    "the determined @xmath43 as a function of the stellar flux is shown in the upper panel of figure 3 for the position @xmath205 at which @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 for the various @xmath44 noted in the figure .",
    "the lf is normalized by the surface brightness of the position .",
    "note that as a star becomes fainter , it can only be detected at higher amplification and that the detection limit decreases as @xmath44 increases .",
    "now one is ready to compute event rate for any adopted @xmath44 with the results of the @xmath49 and @xmath209 distributions determined in   3 and   4 .",
    "the term `` event rate '' is somewhat subjective because its value depends on the required precision and strategy of the experiment . to measure the time scale with better precision , higher @xmath23",
    "is required .",
    "the relation between the precision of measurement and the required @xmath23 is quantified by a factor @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is the fractional accuracy of the time scale measurement .",
    "its value is computed as a function of @xmath12 and shown in figure 1 of gould ( 1996 ) . to determine @xmath44 , i use the mean value , @xmath212 , since @xmath213 is a slowly varying function of @xmath12 except in the region of very close encounter event ( i.e. , @xmath214 ) ; @xmath215 in the range @xmath216 .",
    "the required minimum signal - to - noise ratio is then , @xmath217    first i estimate the event detection rate based on the precision that can distinguish lensing events from flux variation due to statistical noise . in principle",
    "it is possible to select events up to the poisson limit of @xmath218 fluctuations , i.e. , @xmath219 ( gould 1996 ) . to be conservative ,",
    "i use @xmath220 .",
    "the resultant event rate map @xmath221 , @xmath222 , at this @xmath44 is constructed and shown in figure 4 as a contour map .",
    "the contour levels are drawn in units of @xmath223 .",
    "then the total event rate detected over the entire area of the image , @xmath224 , is computed by @xmath225 resulting in @xmath226 .",
    "now i stiffen the qualification of events by counting only those that can provide time scales with an acceptable uncertainty , @xmath227 .",
    "the required signal - to - noise ratio is then @xmath228 determined from equation ( 6.3.1 ) .",
    "the result is @xmath229 .",
    "the total event rate for other values of @xmath44 are shown in figure 5 for individual lens population events .",
    "there are several ways of improving the event rate .",
    "first , one can increase @xmath123 by reducing the seeing difference , @xmath230 , which causes additional noise @xmath231 .",
    "the easiest way to reduce @xmath161 is classifying images ( there will be @xmath232 of them ) with similar seeing , and then subtracting the current image from reference images of similar seeing .",
    "the other method , which is being developed by tomaney & crotts ( 1996 ) , is reducing the seeing differences by convolving the current image so that the resultant psf matches the reference frame .",
    "second , the event rate would increase by carrying out the experiment at more than one place . by observing more often , one could detect events with shorter @xmath233 than could not be detected from a single site . the other effect of multi - observation on @xmath123",
    "is the increase of the time averaged photon detection rate , @xmath33 .",
    "finally , a bigger telescope will detect more events .",
    "the event rates with the additionally adopted observational strategies ( single or combined ) are shown in table 1 .",
    "the values in the second and third columns represent @xmath123 when @xmath234 and 80 , respectively .",
    "the values in the parentheses represent the improved factors in @xmath123 compared to the value obtained under the observational condition described in   6.2 .",
    "if all of these strategies are adopted , the event rate would increase by up to a factor @xmath235 , so one could obtain events with time scale data at a rate @xmath236 . therefore , a few years of observation would provide one with a data set large enough for the analysis of m31 stars and machos . from this analysis , one can obtain important information such as the lf of m31 bulge stars ( gould 1996 ) , the optical depth distribution of machos , and above all the mass spectrum of m31 machos ( han & gould 1996a ) .",
    "the determined event rate is subject to many sources of uncertainties .",
    "these include insufficiently detailed density and velocity distributions and mass spectrum of m31 bulge machos .",
    "additional uncertainties from the crude models of extinction and the lf also propagate to the determination of the event rate .    among all the uncertainties ,",
    "however , the most important comes from the stellar mass density and the fraction of dark matter in various forms , which can only be determined by the comparison of the theoretical predictions with the observational results .",
    "the other uncertainties will not seriously affect the estimates given here .",
    "for example , the velocity field is spectroscopically well constrained .",
    "although the model lf at the faint end is very uncertain , stars in this regime make little contribution to the event rate because they are generally too faint to be detected .",
    "thus , the detailed structure of the faint end of the lf is not important . of course , my determination of the amount of extinction , @xmath139 , is not precise enough for other type of studies such as the construction of an extinction map which would require very detailed observation .",
    "however , in the optically thin limit , the event rate depends only on the mean extinction ( and even for a totally opaque disk only falls by a factor @xmath237 ) , so the error induced by uncertain extinction is unlikely to exceed 10% .",
    "in addition , it has been demonstrated by tomaney & crotts ( 1996 ) that systematic errors can be brought under very good control .",
    "for example , they measure the flux variation of a variable found in the central m31 bulge ( surface brightness @xmath238 ) with a @xmath239 flux error equivalent to @xmath240 , within a factor @xmath241 of the photon limit and 8 mag below the flux in a seeing disk .",

    "<S> i demonstrate that one can detect pixel gravitational microlensing events at the rate @xmath0 and that some fraction of events ( @xmath1 ) will be good enough to measure time scales at the @xmath2 level if the experiment is carried out toward the central m31 bulge region with a dedicated 1 m telescope and a @xmath3 ccd . </S>",
    "<S> i also show that the event rate could be significantly increased ( up to a factor 6.5 ) if more aggressive observation strategies are adopted . </S>",
    "<S> these aggressive strategies include multiple observation sites , using a bigger telescope , and reduction of seeing differences among images . </S>",
    "<S> a few years of observation could provide a data set big enough to extract important information about the m31 bulge such as the optical depth distribution , the mass spectrum of m31 machos , and the luminosity function , which currently can not be obtained by other methods . </S>",
