    "the schematic view of setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "axially symmetric discharge chamber is placed in the mirror magnetic trap of the length 200 mm , produced by pulsed coils which allow to obtain maximum magnetic field strength of 4.3 t , mirror ratio is about 5 , pulse duration 7ms .",
    "discharge chamber is a tube with inner diameter of 38 mm which is widened in center part by the tube with inner diameter of 72 mm and 50 mm length .",
    "plasma is created and supported under the ecr conditions at the fundamental cyclotron harmonic .",
    "the microwave radiation is launched along the trap axis through the teflon window , and is focused to one of the ecr zones by a matching unit .",
    "the ecr surfaces , that correspond to the magnetic field strength 1.34 t , are situated symmetrically between the magnetic mirror point and the trap center .",
    "ambient pressure of a neutral gas varies during experimental shot from @xmath0 to @xmath1torr .",
    "most of the reported experiments are performed in nitrogen , although similar results are obtained in argon and other gases .",
    "at least four stages of ecr discharge with different plasma parameters can be identified @xcite , see table  [ tab : plasma_parameters ] . at the first stage , with a duration of about 100 @xmath2s ,",
    "the plasma density is small and the absorbed microwave energy is enough to accelerate electrons up to relativistic energies . at the second stage , which lasts until the end of the microwave pulse , the bulk plasma density is higher than during the first stage by more than two orders of magnitude . at that period ,",
    "the plasma consists definitely of two - components , a cold dense component ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) with an isotropic velocity distribution , and the less dense component of hot electrons ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) with anisotropic distribution function .",
    "the transition from the initial start - up discharge stage to the stage of developed ecr discharge takes about several decades of microseconds and is related to the plasma density increase resulted from ionization of neutral gas arriving into the trap with increasing flow rate due to desorption from the inner walls @xcite . the energy stored in hot electrons",
    "is partially spent on ionization of the incoming neutral gas . during this stage ,",
    "the plasma density is about the critical density @xmath7@xmath8 for microwave radiation at 37.5ghz . at this density level",
    ", the absorbed microwave power is not sufficient to heat an essential number of electrons to relativistic energies , thus the average electron energy decreases .",
    "the third stage starts right after the ecr heating switch - off , when density of cold fraction decreases rapidly , while the hot electrons with an anisotropic velocity distribution function are confined in the magnetic trap much longer . starting from a certain time ,",
    "the density of the hot component become equal to or even higher than the density of the cold component .",
    "the fourth stage is observed with a delay about hundreds of microseconds in a decaying plasma when density of cold plasma is much less than the density of the hot component .    the dynamic spectrum and intensity of stimulated plasma emissions",

    "the signal is picked up with a broadband horn antenna with a uniform bandwidth in the range from 2 to 20ghz .",
    "simultaneously , precipitations of energetic electrons ( @xmath9kev ) from the trap ends are measured by a pin - diode detector with time resolution about 1ns .",
    "this experimental technique was reported in refs .  ;",
    "as compared to our early studies @xcite the present experiment allows us to observe the whole picture of instabilities and distinguish details of the radiation spectrum .    to cover all stages of ecr discharge ,",
    "the length of the recorded waveforms is set to 5ms what corresponds to @xmath10 data points ( depending on oscilloscope model ) per channel for a single experimental shot .",

    "the described stages of pulsed ecr discharge offer the opportunity to simultaneously study wave - particles interactions for essentially different plasma parameters : at the initial stage , when the density of hot relativistic electrons exceeds the density of cold electrons , at the developed steady ecr discharge , and in the decaying plasma after the gyrotron switch - off . on each stage",
    "we detect series of quasi - periodic broadband pulses of electromagnetic radiation with typical duration of a few microseconds , and related precipitations of energetic electrons , which are presumably caused by cyclotron instability of different electromagnetic modes or by generation of plasma waves .",

    "after that the spectrum of microwave emission is changed to the continuous broadband radiation during 510 - 580@xmath2s . in both cases the bandwidth of emission is about several ghz .",
    "it is seen from the spectrogram that the lower spectrum boundary of radiation is greater than @xmath17 on the value of about @xmath18 .",
    "analysis of the most favorable conditions for excitation of the loss - cone instability may be used to estimate the maximum energy of the hot resonant electrons @xcite .",

    "this agrees well with the previously published data on the measurement of the electron energy distribution @xcite .      during the developed discharge phase we registered microwave emission in a direction along the trap axis , i.e. longitudinal to the ambient magnetic field , at frequencies about @xmath22 ,",

    "the distinctive feature of this type of instability is the presence of the selected frequencies ( more than ten ) in the spectrum , which are arranged equidistantly relatively to each other .",

    "the dpr condition , @xmath34 or equivalently @xmath35 , was met for the decreasing uhr frequency during the plasma decay . for the example shown in fig .",

    "synchronously , strong precipitations of fast electrons from the trap are triggered .",
    "in contrast to previous types , this kind of emission has no frequency sweep in a single burst , the spectral width of radiation is @xmath36 .",
    "the period of oscillations is about 200ns and a single burst duration is about 50ns .",
    "the electromagnetic energy released during this particular phase is more than a half of the total energy emitted during the entire decay phase . by this moment of time",
    ", the density of the decaying cold plasma does not drop essentially , so that @xmath37 and @xmath38 , hence we still consider the dense plasma case .",
    "it should be noted that increased uhr activity under the dpr conditions is not a rare event in astrophysical plasmas .",
    "it is related to the phenomenon of zebra patterns observed in the solar corona ( type iv bursts ) @xcite , to the decametric radiation of jupiter and even to the radio emissions of pulsars @xcite .",
    "next type of instability develops at the mature phase of plasma decay when @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and the ecr heating of unstable electrons is off , see in fig .",

    "such instability was first observed as quasi - periodic series of pulsed energetic electron precipitations that appeared with some delay after the heating power off @xcite , later rough estimations of plasma cyclotron emission spectrum were obtained using microwave detectors @xcite , and just recently detailed dynamic spectra were measured with a digital broadband oscilloscope @xcite .    typical dynamic spectrum of plasma emission during the decay stage is shown in fig .  [ fig_spectrum5 ] .",
    "plasma emission consists of a sequence of periodic bursts with decreasing frequency within a single burst .",
    "the duration of every burst is about 1@xmath2s and the period varies from 50 to 100@xmath2s .",
    "almost every burst starts with a narrow - band emission at frequency slowly decreasing in time . then during a very short period of time ( about 100ns )",
    "the frequency of radiation rapidly drops with a speed about 5ghz/@xmath2s.the moment of fast frequency drop is correlated with energetic electrons precipitation from the trap ends .",
    "the frequency of emission is between @xmath17 and @xmath29 , and is also proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "originally , the instability was interpreted as a result of resonant interaction at the fundamental cyclotron harmonic between the energetic electrons and the slow extraordinary waves propagating in a rarefied plasma across the external magnetic field at frequencies below the local gyrofrequency @xcite .",
    "the delay between the ecr heating switch - off and triggering of the instability was explained by a polarization depression effect of the background ( more dense and cold ) plasma .",
    "however , more recent measurements clearly showed that the instability develops above the fundamental cyclotron harmonic near the trap center .",
    "it means that either the source region of this instability is not located in the trap center , or the instability can not be attributed to the slow x waves .",
    "the latter option is more reasonable since the region of the most uniform magnetic field in the trap center seems to be most favorable for excitation of kinetic ec instabilities .",
    "thus , we assume now that this instability is more likely related to the obliquely propagating fast x wave generated at the fundamental cyclotron harmonic , just as in the case of x - mode emission at the start - up phase , or its second harmonic . in most shots",
    "we observe a delay before triggering of the instability at the fundamental harmonic that is caused by the cut - off due to presence of the cold and dense background plasma @xcite .",
    "interesting to note that , in spite of completely different mechanisms , the background plasma density required for triggering of the slow and fast x - modes at the fundamental harmonic is defined by qualitatively the same condition @xmath41 where @xmath6 is the characteristic kinetic energy of radiating fast electrons .",
    "as discussed further , the sequences of pulsed bursts at the nonlinear instability phase may be explained in terms of a cyclotron maser model with a fast decrease of electromagnetic energy losses @xcite .",
    "the temporal behavior of microwave bursts and synchronous electron precipitations may be rather complex .",
    "together with periodic patterns of bursts , single bursts may join in periodic groups of bursts , see fig .",
    "[ fig_spectrum5 ] , the interval between bursts may become irregular and generation may even be switched to a stochastic regime@xcite .",

    "frequency band of the observed microwave emission is below the electron cyclotron frequency @xmath17 in the trap center .",
    "dependency of emission frequency band on the ambient magnetic field change proves that the excited waves are of a cyclotron nature .",
    "the dynamic spectrum of emission is a set of highly chirped radiation bursts with both increasing and decreasing frequencies .",
    "frequency change rate is in the range 2040mhz/@xmath2s .",
    "the bandwidth of this narrow - band emission is about @xmath43 . rising tones experience in frequency sweep a saturation level after which the intensity of microwave emission is abruptly reduced .",

    "sometimes a very long series of pulses with a duration up to 1ms are observed .    unlike other types of instabilities observed in the experiment , in this case electromagnetic emission in all cases is not accompanied by precipitating hot electrons .",

    "below we discuss the formation of regions with @xmath54 in phase - space that may serve as a source of free energy for the kinetic instabilities .    as shown by many authors , strong ecr plasma heating in adiabatic magnetic traps results in formation of anisotropic distributions of accelerated fast electrons characterized by a predominance of transverse velocities ( relative to the direction of the magnetic field ) to the longitudinal ones . for weakly relativistic electrons this may by modeled by bi - maxwellian distribution , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an additional step - like function that describes the empty loss - cone in velocity space , @xmath57 , typical for adiabatically confined particles in a mirror trap .",

    "such instabilities are only possible for inclined propagation at @xmath58 , i.e. for the fast x mode @xcite .",
    "let us assume that the resonance curve touches the loss - cone at velocities @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this condition unambiguously defines the frequency and propagation angle for the most unstable x wave @xcite , @xmath63 with @xmath64 defined from the loss - cone boundary .",
    "this may be used to relate the frequency range of the measured emission and the energy of emitting electrons , see e.g. sec .",
    "iii(a ) .",
    "another plasma wave that may be driven unstable by solely the anisotropy of velocity distribution is the whistler wave propagating at small angles to the magnetic field , see e.g. ref .  .",
    "this instability develops at frequencies @xmath65 . on the other hand , in the experiments we measure @xmath66 what corresponds to a very moderate level of the anisotropy required to excite the whistler instability .",
    "peculiar feature of our experiments is that ecr heating is shifted from the trap center towards higher magnetic field .",
    "the distribution function of fast electrons in the ecr heating zone is approximated with eq .",
    "( [ eq_edf ] ) , however this distribution deforms while moving to lower magnetic field regions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_edf ] ( bottom plot ) .",
    "such deformation may be understood assuming adiabatic motion of fast particles along the magnetic field lines such that the kinetic energy @xmath67 and the magnetic momentum @xmath68 are conserved .",

    "so , a strong enough anisotropy of the fast electrons in the heating zone results in butterfly - like distribution in central parts of the trap that possess @xmath60 everywhere except the boundary of the anti - loss - cone , see bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig_edf ] .    the described transition to ``",
    "globally unstable '' butterfly - like distribution function essentially effects the kinetic instabilities .",
    "first , it improves conditions for the fast x mode instability  instead of touching the loss cone boundary at singular point",
    "the resonant curve may go through the body of the butterfly wing ( compare curves 2 in top and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_edf ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the fast x mode instability occurs in a much wider parameters range .",
    "numerically we found that the maximum growth - rate occurs when the resonant curve touches the anti - loss - cone boundary .",
    "thus we again can use eqs .",
    "( [ eq_lcc ] ) to relate the frequency and propagation angle of the measured emission to the energy of emitting electrons , however the angle @xmath82 is now defined from the anti - loss - cone boundary as @xmath83 .",
    "second , the butterfly distribution seems to be less favorable for excitation of the slow x mode than the standard loss - cone distribution ( [ eq_edf ] ) .",
    "the reason is that for butterfly distribution there are always four sharp gradients along the resonant curve  two of them correspond to the loss - cone boundaries and are destabilizing ( @xmath60 ) , the other two correspond to the anti - loss - cone boundaries and are stabilizing ( @xmath84 ) , see curve 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig_edf ] ( bottom ) .",
    "the stabilizing gradients correspond to higher @xmath85 , so they always dominate over destabilizing ones after the integration over the resonance curve .",
    "thus , the slow x mode may develop only inside the ecr heating zone where the anti - loss - cone is absent .",
    "since this region is highly localized , the overall probability of the slow x mode instability is very low .    assuming that @xmath86 and that spread in parallel velocities of fast electrons is defined by its coulomb scattering on dense plasma during the ecr discharge , one obtains the following estimate : @xmath87},\\ ] ] where @xmath88ms is the gyrotron pulse length , and @xmath89 is the collision rate of fast electrons calculated for the background plasma density @xmath90@xmath8 . in our conditions",

    "correspondingly , the magnetic field variation needed for transition to the globally unstable butterfly - like distribution varies from @xmath96 to 40% , so in the worst case @xmath97 t . having in mind that the minimum magnetic field in the trap center is always less than 0.8 t",

    "as seen from the experimental data , the general picture of plasma emission due to kinetic instabilities is very complex .",
    "however , most of the observed features may be understood within a universal model of the cyclotron maser instability .",
    "it is based on common description for the self - consistent evolution of particles and waves by means of the so - called quasilinear theory , a perturbative approach that involves many overlapped wave  particle resonances as a basis for diffusive particle transport in phase space .",
    "quasilinear interaction of hot resonant electrons with the unstable electromagnetic wave reduces its transverse energy , at the same time the wave is exponentially increasing at the linear stage of the instability . as a result , some fast electrons fall within the loss cone and leave the trap .",
    "these losses reduce the instability growth rate and , finally , restrict the increase in the electromagnetic energy density in the system .",
    "the joint evolution of the electromagnetic field and resonant electrons may be described by the standard equations of quasilinear theory@xcite : @xmath100 with @xmath101 these equations describe the wave intensity @xmath102 and the hot electron distribution function @xmath103 over the invariants of adiabatic motion @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the kinetic energy and @xmath2 is the magnetic momentum . here",

    "kernels of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath110 , and of the linear growth - rate , @xmath111 , depend on a particular mode structure .",
    "quasilinear equations are rather complex since they are formulated in at least three - dimensional space  two invariants of the motion and one spatial coordinate in the direction of wave energy travel .",
    "fortunately , the most essential physics may be described qualitatively using much simpler approach of balance equations : @xmath112 with @xmath113 here @xmath114 is the population of resonant electrons , @xmath115 is the total energy of the unstable mode , @xmath116 determines the losses of resonant electrons , @xmath117 is the growth - rate averaged over the wave propagation path , and @xmath118 is the total electromagnetic losses including not ideal reflection from the resonator `` ends '' , where @xmath119 is the `` group time '' of wave packet propagation and @xmath120 is the reflection coefficient .",

    "one can find that very simple balance equations have a rich family of oscillatory solutions , that depending on particular parameters may vary from harmonic oscillations in the vicinity of the equilibrium point up to deeply modulated nonlinear waves with a big intermittency factor .",
    "different regimes of oscillations have been successfully used to interpret the time - resolved burst activity in plasma emission and electron precipitations at different stages of a discharge .",
    "typical examples of simulation of the instability dynamics are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : th ] .      at the initial discharge stage",
    "the free energy is gathered from the source of resonant particles @xmath149 that is increasing in time after the ecr heating switch - on .",
    "correspondingly , the equilibrium is also changing in time .",
    "this may explain the transition between two regimes of the fast x mode instability when periodic wave packets with fast raising frequency smoothly transforms into the continuous spectrum described in sec .",
    "gradual increase of the intensity of the fast electron source results in variation in the stationary level of radiation and related electron precipitations during the discharge evolution .",
    "an increase of this level in times that significantly exceed the relaxation - oscillation period explains the `` quiet '' region ( in which the burst activity is suppressed ) , experimentally observed between the solitary - peak oscillation and the stationary oscillation regions , see times @xmath150 @xmath2s in fig .",
    "[ fig_spectrum1 ] .      during the stationary ecr discharge ,",
    "constant source @xmath148 maintains the equilibrium with a high enough wave energy , so the observed periodic and quasi - stationary emissions may be attributed to small oscillations around this equilibrium .",
    "this picture fits well to the whistler wave instability observed below the central gyrofrequency @xmath17 described in sec .",
    "iii(b ) . however , microwave emissions observed in dense plasma at frequencies between @xmath17 and @xmath29 as described in sec .",

    "theoretical interpretation of this phenomena is still a subject of our efforts .",
    "just after the ecr heating switch - off the source is absent @xmath151 , however initial pool of resonant electrons is still full until the system is below the threshold , @xmath152 . in sec .",
    "iii(d ) we assume the threshold is overcame at the dpr condition @xmath34 . in our model meeting of the dpr condition at some moment of time",
    "is described by a rapid increase of gain @xmath117 in the balance equations ( [ eq : bal ] ) , that triggers the oscillatory motion , most likely , in a deeply non - linear regime of a giant impulse .    in a more accurate description developed in ref .  , the pulsing mode of the uhr turbulence is related either to the competition of the instability and induced scattering of plasma waves , or the excitation of fast magnetosonic waves in the magnetic trap",
    ". the first interpretation seems more favorable due to a rather high growth rates of plasma waves typical of our experimental conditions . with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bal ] ) , the induced scattering of the uh waves is described as additional non - linear modulation of the loss term @xmath118 .      at the late stage of plasma decay",
    "the source is also absent @xmath151 , and the initial pool of resonant electrons may be empty because of instabilities developed previously .",
    "the effective source of free energy is provided by a fast decrease of the wave damping rate , that constantly drives the system above the instability threshold .",
    "it has been shown that , even in the absence of a continuously acting source of nonequilibrium particles , the instability condition @xmath153 is recovered after each individual burst due to a monotonic decrease of the collisional absorption @xmath154 in a decaying plasma @xcite . in this way , we explain the sequences of pulsed bursts discussed in sec .",
    "our simple model does not reproduce many features of a complex temporal behavior of microwave bursts and synchronous electron precipitations observed in the experiment . as already mentioned , together with periodic patterns of bursts",
    ", single bursts may join in periodic groups of bursts with irregular intervals between the patches of bursts . to describe more complex maser dynamics",
    ", the balance equations may be further generalized to include several competing unstable modes . in particular , some features in the",
    "observed complex temporal dynamics in a decaying plasma , such as burst grouping and spontaneous transition from quasi - periodic to stochastic regime , was explained with the idea of self - modulation of a maser due to interference of two counter - propagating degenerate unstable waves resulting in spatial modulation of amplification @xcite .",
    "however this model can not describe the frequency sweeps resolved in the reported experiments , and especially the complex transients in dynamic spectra described in sec .",
    "iii(f ) .",
    "modification of the spectra are typically related to neat modification of the distribution function of the resonant particles . within quasi - linear approach ,",
    "which is most developed for the whistler and alfven wave cyclotron instabilities in space @xcite , the frequency sweeping may be explained as a result of relatively slow modification of the average distribution function of the resonant particles in the frame of the full kinetic equation .",
    "although quasilinear theory is in principle able to describe fast events , such as switching from kinetic to hydrodynamic instability in the inner magnetosphere of the earth @xcite , it faces essential difficulties in many cases involving fast transients .",
    "to explain complex transients with periodic frequency sweeps observed in decaying plasma as described in sec .",
    "iii(f ) , we consider an alternative universal physical mechanism based on formation of nonlinear phase space structures in the proximity of the wave - particle resonances of a kinetically unstable bulk plasma mode@xcite .",
    "such regimes were proposed as a possible mechanism of generation of narrow - band chorus emissions in the earth s magnetosphere@xcite .",
    "later evolution of similar phase space structures was studied in refs .   for the case of essential wave dissipation , which is more relevant to our experiments . here",
    "the wave resonances do not overlap and the global quasi - linear transport in phase space is suppressed . as the mode grows ,",
    "most of the particles respond adiabatically to the wave , and only a small group of resonant particles mix and cause local flattening of the distribution function in phase space within or near the separatrices formed by the waves",
    ". however , when a linear dissipation from a background plasma is present , the saturated plateau state becomes unstable and the mode tends to grow explosively .",
    "this results in the formation and subsequent evolution of long - living structures in the particle distribution , so called holes ( a depletion of particles ) and clumps ( an excess of particles ) , whose frequencies are slightly up- and down - shifted with respect to that of the initial instability .",
    "their subsequent convective motion in the phase space is synchronized to the change in wave frequency , thus leading to complex chirping patterns in dynamical spectra of unstable waves@xcite .",
    "this model seems to be the most suitable to explain the transients with periodic frequency sweeps observed in our experiment . for a very rough estimate",
    ", one can isolate one spectral component and model the evolution in time of one chirping event .",
    "then , in the collisionless limit for resonant particles , a bounce average of maxwell  vlasov kinetic equations yields the frequency shift @xmath155 an unstable mode as@xcite @xmath156 this expression is valid for the regime where resonant particles are deeply trapped in the wave potential and perturbation of the passing particle is negligible@xcite .",
    "although this result was originally obtained for purely electrostatic and one - dimensional bump - on - tail instability , it gives reasonable qualitative estimates for more complex electromagnetic problems@xcite .",
    "thus , we may apply eq .",
    "( [ eq : bb ] ) to oue case of the extraordinary wave propagating in rarefied plasma . fitting the the measured frequency sweeps @xmath157 by constant @xmath158 and assuming near - threshold condition @xmath159",
    ", one may estimate the upper boundary for the dissipation @xmath118 or , equivalently , the lower boundary for the growth rate @xmath121 compatible with eq .",
    "( [ eq : bb ] ) . in the experiments we obtain typical values @xmath160s@xmath161 resulting in @xmath162s@xmath99 , what is in reasonable agreement with independent estimates .",
    "more details may be found in ref .  .",
    "studies of cyclotron instabilities in magnetically trapped laboratory plasmas have a long history but still remain topical , mostly with advent of powerful sources of microwave radiation ( especially , gyrotrons ) , which allow to sufficiently raise the level of energy input into the plasma thereby increasing the `` energetics '' of nonequilibrium resonant particles .",
    "an important advantage of nonequilibrium ecr discharge plasma is an opportunity to recreate different conditions for excitation and amplification of waves in plasma in the same setup . on the other hand , generation of pulsed electromagnetic radiation accompanied by hot electrons precipitation in the laboratory conditions has much in common with similar processes occurring in the magnetosphere of earth , planets , and solar coronal loops .",
    "thus , this paper may be of interest in the context of a laboratory modeling of non - stationary processes of wave - particle interactions in space plasma , since there are a lot of open questions about the origin of some types of emissions in space cyclotron masers , especially mechanisms of fine spectral structures .",
