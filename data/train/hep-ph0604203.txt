    "because the model is nonrenormalizable , the high momentum part of the model has to be regularized in a phenomenological way .",
    "the common practice has been to regularize the divergent loop amplitudes with a three - dimensional momentum cutoff @xmath2  gev , which also sets the energy - momentum scale for the validity of the model .",
    "that is , the model can not be used for studying phenomena involving momenta running in loops larger than @xmath3 . in particular , the model can not be used to study quark matter at high densities @xmath4 with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the quark fermi momentum .",
    "one of the symptoms of this problem is the prediction of vanishing superconducting gaps at high baryon densities , a feature of the model that is solely caused by the use of a regularizing momentum cutoff @xmath3 of the divergent loop integrals  @xcite .",
    "recently , we  @xcite have presented an alternative to the cutoff regularization of the njl model , in which the one - loop integrals are reorganized through mathematical identities in a way finite integrals become separated from density - independent divergent integrals .",
    "the finite integrals are integrated without imposing any restriction on the integration momenta and the divergent integrals are related to physical quantities at the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in vacuum . as a result , instead of a vanishing gap like in the cutoff regularization one obtains a finite gap that grows with density .",
    "however , this does not mean that the model can be used at arbitrarily high densities .",
    "the point is that any implicit regularized integral contains an implicit scale , the regularization scale .",
    "when such an integral is fitted to a physical quantity in vacuum , we are implicitly also fitting this scale .",
    "now , in a loop integral at nonzero density and/or temperature , the vacuum part is determined by the regularization scale and the finite integrals are governed by the chemical potential and temperature . when these scales are very different , one obtains nonsense results .",
    "nevertheless , this mismatch of scales is less problematic in the implicit regularization scheme than in any other cutoff regularization scheme , in the sense that one can go to much higher densities and temperatures before the problem shows up .",
    "the root of the problem is of course the nonrenormalizability of the model . in a renormalizable theory",
    "all the dependence on the cutoff can be removed in favor of running physical parameters , like the coupling constants of qed and qcd .",
    "the running is given by the renormalization group equations of the theory and is controlled by an energy scale that is adjusted to the scale of the experimental conditions under consideration . in a recent publication , casalbuoni et al .",
    "@xcite have introduced the concept of a running coupling constant for the njl model to extend the applicability of the model to high density .",
    "the arguments are based on making the cutoff density dependent , using an analogy with an ordinary solid . in an ordinary solid",
    ", there is a natural maximum phonon frequency - the debye frequency - that increases as the lattice spacing gets smaller . in",
    "quark matter , as the density of quarks increases , the quarks get closer together and therefore the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath7 of the njl model should be allowed to increase correspondingly .",
    "the cutoff can be changed consistently without spoiling the predictions of the model for the chiral properties of the vacuum if the four - fermion coupling constant @xmath8 of the model is allowed to change with the cutoff . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cutoff dependence of @xmath8 is obtained from the joint consideration of the divergent expressions for the pion decay constant @xmath9 and the gap equation for the constituent quark mass @xmath10 : fixing the value of @xmath9 at @xmath11  mev , the divergent expression of @xmath12 ( in the chiral limit ) , regulated with a cutoff @xmath7 , leads to a constituent quark mass @xmath10 that is @xmath7 dependent .",
    "the use of this @xmath13 into the gap equation gives rise to a coupling @xmath8 that runs with @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the running of the coupling is such that @xmath14 decreases with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "this is certainly physically motivated and is also in accord with the interpretation  @xcite that the cutoff in the njl model simulates - albeit in a crude way - the property of asymptotic freedom of qcd , in the sense that the coupling between quarks decreases as higher momentum scales are probed .",
    "a similar suggestion was made by shakin and collaborators  @xcite in studies of hadronic correlation functions .",
    "they found that results in qualitative accord with lattice qcd calculations can be obtained once a significant temperature dependence of the cutoff and of the coupling @xmath8 is allowed .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that it is possible to extend the applicability of the njl model to high densities and temperatures without the use of an explicit regularization of divergences .",
    "the basic motivation for avoiding an explicit regularization such as those commonly used like the three- or four - momentum cutoff , pauli - villars and proper - time regularizations , is that these lead to global and gauge symmetry violations , and to the breaking of causality and unitarity .",
    "although in many situations these problems do not have great influences on the final numerical results , there are situations , however , where they do have drastic consequences , like in studies of correlation functions .",
    "arguments have been used and tricks invented to circumvent such problems , but no satisfactory solution has been found  for a good discussion on these issues , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the implicit regularization scheme has been originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and was used in different contexts   @xcite , including applications to the njl model  @xcite . at the one - loop approximation",
    ", there appears only two divergent integrals , one is quadratically divergent and the other is logarithmically divergent .",
    "once the divergent integrals are assumed to be implicitly regulated , i.e. regulated without the specification an explicit regulator , they will depend implicitly on a momentum scale that we denote by @xmath7 .",
    "these integrals satisfy well - defined scaling relations , in that the integrals at some mass scale can be related to a combination of the same integrals at some another , arbitrary scale .",
    "these scaling relations allow to express the divergent parts of the amplitudes at finite temperature and density in terms of their counterparts at zero temperature and density .",
    "moreover , fixing @xmath9 in the vacuum , one can derive a scaling relation for the four - fermion coupling @xmath8 which gives a running @xmath15 similar to that found in ref .",
    "all this is achieved , we reiterate , without specifying an explicit regularization scheme .    in the next section we review the main aspects of the implicit regularization scheme  @xcite that are most relevant for the present paper .",
    "we start specifying the lagrangian density we are going to use and then explain the scaling relations and their use for obtaining the solution of the gap equation within this scheme . in order to make contact with results of the literature , we solve numerically this gap equation at finite temperature and density and show the results for the quark condensate as a function of temperature @xmath1 and quark chemical potential @xmath16 . in section",

    "the divergent integral is an element of the systematization adopted in the calculational strategy @xcite which we use in the present work . in 4d one - loop calculations , within the context of theories and models where the divergence degree is not higher than cubic , which is the case of the njl model , besides @xmath34",
    "there also appears the basic logarithmically divergent object @xmath35 in the njl model , @xmath34 is related to the constituent quark mass , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ gap_m ] ) , while @xmath36 is related to the pion decay constant in vacuum ",
    "( [ fpi ] ) .",
    "the traditional procedure to treat the divergent amplitudes in nonrenormalizable models is the introduction of a regularization distribution in all loop integrals in order to render them convergent . in the context of the njl model , with rare exceptions  such as in refs .",
    "@xcite  the _ finite _ integral @xmath37 containing the fermi - dirac distributions is also regularized . due to the nonrenormalizable character of the model , the regularization introduced in this way can not be removed along the calculations and therefore the predictions become associated with the chosen regularization . in practice , the amplitudes become functions of the regularization distribution parameters and consequently the energy - momentum dependence of the amplitudes , as emerging from the feynman rules , are modified . as it is well - known , this leads to violation of fundamental symmetries like those associated to space - time homogeneity or to the introduction of non - physical thresholds that break unitarity .    having this in mind ,",
    "an alternative strategy to handle the divergences typical of the perturbative calculations in qft has been developed in ref .",
    "the main idea is to avoid the critical step of the explicit evaluation of a divergent integral .",
    "the finite and divergent parts are separated by using a convenient representation for the propagators , in that all the dependence on the physical momenta is located in finite integrals which are not affected by regularization , thus avoiding the contamination with non - physical behaviors .",
    "the divergent parts obtained in this way are reduced to only a small number of basic objects after the adoption of a set of properties for purely divergent integrals , denominated consistency relations ( cr ) , which are dictated by the requirements of symmetry preservation and elimination of ambiguities  @xcite .",
    "the remaining divergent objects need not be solved explicitly ; in renormalizable theories they are completely absorbed in renormalization of physical parameters , and in nonrenormalizable models they can be directly adjusted to physical quantities .",
    "there are many advantages in the adoption of the procedure just described , but two of them can be immediately noted : the treatment for the divergences is universal and the energy - momentum dependence of the amplitudes is not modified . besides , a connection with traditional procedures can be made .",
    "in particular , all results can be mapped to the ones obtained within the context of dimensional regularization ( dr ) , in situations where this method applies . on the other hand",
    ", the connection with regularizations based on regularizing distributions requires some care in the case of nonrenormalizable models , due to the fact that the effects of the regularization on finite integrals are removed in our strategy . in this sense",
    "it is important to say that the prescription described above , which has been applied in many problems involving divergences in qft @xcite , represents a particular prescription to handle the amplitudes having divergences .",
    "therefore , it should be considered a procedure to make predictions with nonrenormalizable models in the same way as with any other regularization prescription . however , the important point to be noted is that , by construction many of the problems intrinsic to the traditional methods have been circumvented , like violations of symmetry relations among green s functions , ambiguities , non - physical thresholds and scale invariance breaking .",
    "the convenience or usefulness of the method for the treatment of nonrenormalizable models should be judged by the consistency of its phenomenological implications .    at one loop order , only two divergent integrals ,",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath36 need be eliminated by some phenomenological adjustment .",
    "we first note that they are not independent quantities , they obey two scaling relations @xcite @xmath38 , \\label{sr_1 } \\\\",

    "these relations allow us to relate the basic divergent quantities in two different mass scales , as we shall see in a moment .",
    "the imposition of scale independence implies in two properties for these objects @xmath40 it is important to note that only finite quantities have been differentiated .",
    "the above properties work like requirements that must be imposed in regularizations in order to maintain the scaling properties of the amplitudes .",
    "the above referred properties can be understood within the context of regularizations . for this purpose ,",
    "we assume that each integral is regularized through an unspecified distribution @xmath41 , where @xmath7 is a parameter with the dimensions of momentum such that @xmath42 differentiating @xmath34 , relation ( [ rel_1 ] ) follows immediately . by differentiating ( [ ilog ] ) , on the other hand",
    ", we obtain @xmath43 since the integral is finite and assuming the existence of the limit @xmath44 , one can extract the regulating distribution and perform the integration to obtain ( [ rel_2 ] ) .",
    "this last point illustrates the basic difference between our prescription and the traditional ones .",
    "the fact that the parameter @xmath3 plays the role of a cutoff can be made clear even in the case of an implicit regularization .",
    "that is , it is possible to make the @xmath7 dependence explicit without specifying the regulating function .",
    "this can be done by defining the dimensionless ratio @xmath45 and writing @xmath34 and @xmath36 in terms of dimensionless integrals @xmath46 and @xmath47 as @xmath48 with @xmath49 where the integration variable @xmath50 is dimensionless .",
    "the integrals @xmath51 and@xmath52 obey scaling relations completely similar to that ( [ sr_1 ] ) and ( [ sr_2 ] ) , as they should . a general parametrization for these integrals , obeying the properties ( [ rel_1 ] ) and ( [ rel_2 ] ) , can be constructed and written as @xmath53 it should be clear that if a regularization distribution does not furnish the above general form , the scaling properties of the amplitudes can be broken . in principle , different ( consistent ) regularizations should differ only by the values of the constants @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    after this review on the general procedure to handle the divergences ,",
    "let us turn our attention to its application to the njl model .",
    "first , we have that the vacuum quark condensate is related to the scalar one - point function , which can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the mass obtained by solving the gap equation in vacuum . on the other hand , the pion decay constant @xmath9 can be related to the axial - pseudoscalar two - point function , such that @xmath58the point now is that one can express the temperature- and density - dependent gap equation  ( [ gap_m ] ) for quark mass @xmath10 in terms of these vacuum quantities .",
    "this is so because in general the scaling relations ( [ sr_1 ] ) and ( [ sr_2 ] ) can be used to isolate vacuum contributions from temperature - and density - dependent contributions in expressions for physical quantities , that is , it is possible to write @xmath34 and@xmath59 in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath61 . using the scaling relation in ( [ gap_m ] ) , we get @xmath62 \\hspace{0cm}-i(t,\\mu ) \\biggr\\ } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{gap_t_mu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have made use of eqs .",
    "( [ cond ] ) and ( [ fpi ] ) . the corresponding expression for the case",
    "@xmath63 is a little more complicated than the one shown in eq .",
    "( [ gap_t_mu ] ) , since the expression for @xmath64 contains , in addition to @xmath65 , a finite integral involving the pion mass .",

    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ cond_t_mu ] , this implicit regularization scheme gives the expected reduction of the quark condensate in medium .",
    "in addition , this reduction is in qualitative agreement with the result obtained with traditional cutoff regularization schemes - see for example fig .",

    "@xcite . in the chiral limit , the order of the phase transition is first order .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that with these same parameters one is able to obtain good values for the @xmath72- and @xmath73-meson masses  @xcite .",
    "of course , the point of the exercise here was not only to show that this different way of handling the divergent integrals gives results in accord with the expected phenomenology .",

    "in addition , it is easy to show that causality is also preserved by checking that the amplitudes obey the correct dispersion relations . gauge symmetry is also preserved and the ambiguities are eliminated at the one - loop level , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the gauged njl model .",
    "a complete discussion of these matters are discussed in detail in a separate publication  @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of the present approach is that it can be used with heavy quarks .",
    "the scaling relations involve the ratio of the quark mass to the implicit regulation scale and naturally take into account short - distance effects as the quark mass increases .",
    "this is very important in connection with studies of heavy - quark bound states in highly excited quark matter ."

    "<S> traditional cutoff regularization schemes of the nambu  jona - lasinio model limit the applicability of the model to energy - momentum scales much below the value of the regularizing cutoff . in particular , the model can not be used to study quark matter with fermi momenta larger than the cutoff . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> an extension of the model to high temperatures and densities recently proposed by casalbuoni , gatto , nardulli , and ruggieri is used in connection with an implicit regularization scheme . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by making use of scaling relations of the divergent one - loop integrals that relate these integrals at different energy - momentum scales . fixing the pion decay constant at the chiral symmetry breaking scale in the vacuum , </S>",
    "<S> the scaling relations predict a running coupling constant that decreases as the regularization scale increases , implementing in a schematic way the property of asymptotic freedom of quantum chromodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> if the regularization scale is allowed to increase with density and temperature , the coupling will decrease with density and temperature , extending in this way the applicability of the model to high densities and temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> these results are obtained without specifying an explicit regularization . as an illustration of the formalism </S>",
    "<S> , numerical results are obtained for the finite density and finite temperature quark condensate , and to the problem of color superconductivity at high quark densities and finite temperature . </S>"
