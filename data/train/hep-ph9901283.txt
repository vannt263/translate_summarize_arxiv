    "qcd parton distribution functions are specified by matrix - elements of nonlocal quark and gluon twist-2 operators separated by a light like distance and taken inside a forward nucleon matrix element .",
    "although these forward matrix elements were generalized long time ago to nonforward parton distribution functions @xcite , where nonlocal qcd operators are sandwiched between states of unequal momenta , they became only recently the object of intense studies @xcite .",
    "this interest was driven by the hope that the measurement of nonforward parton distributions ( ) and subsequent extrapolation to the forward limit might shed more light on the spin and angular momentum composition of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "contrary to ordinary parton distribution functions , nonforward parton distribution functions are probed when the nucleon recoils elastically .",
    "thus provide a natural interpolation between ordinary parton distribution functions and elastic form factors .",
    "it was shown that are in principle measurable in deeply virtual compton scattering or through exclusive production of light vector mesons .    in this paper",
    "we shall consider the diffractive leptoproduction of quark antiquark pairs in a kinematics where the produced quark pair does not form a single meson but fragments into a @xmath0 or @xmath1 pair with comparatively large @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ momenta ] ) .",
    "we will consider the case of longitudinal polarized electron beam and proton target .",
    "this process is quite similar to diffractive leptoproduction of dijets , analyzed in @xcite , which was proposed to allow for a measurement of the polarized glue in the nucleon .",
    "we notice that at medium energies like in the hermes experiment dijets can not be observed . in this experiment",
    "one can only look for single hadrons representing the jets .",
    "the idea to access the polarized forward gluon distribution function of the nucleon via the measurement of a double hadronic high momentum final state has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "we treat the fragmentation process of the two produced quarks into the final hadrons using the lund string fragmentation model @xcite .",
    "to be precise we use this model to extrapolate from dijet production , where it is known to be valid , to the case where the two jets are represented by e.g. @xmath3 and @xmath4 . while we do not expect the lund model to give precise results in this few particle process",
    "it should allow for an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "in our calculation we will assume that two pion ( kaon ) leptoproduction can be factorized into three parts .",
    "we have two soft parts : one describing the fragmentation of the two partons , the other the production of two partons from the elastic scattering off the nucleon .",
    "the second soft part will be given by a nucleon matrix element of a light cone operator parameterized by .",
    "the hard part connects the elastic scattering process and subsequent fragmentation .    technically , the process we consider is closely related to the exclusive production of a light vector meson . in such a case",
    "the proof of factorization has been given in @xcite .",
    "recall that the proof only holds for longitudinal photons .",
    "meson production by a transversely polarized photon is plagued by endpoint singularities as noted in @xcite .",
    "thus a general factorization theorem does not exist in this case .",
    "further the factorization theorem was proven only on the level of twist-2 .",
    "however , it was noted that the proof in @xcite can be extended to two - pion production if these are produced close to threshold , i.e. if the mass of the produced final state is much smaller than the virtuality of the probing photon @xcite .",
    "in such a kinematics it is useful to describe the pion pair in terms of a two - pion twist-2 distribution amplitude @xcite .",
    "the main difference to our calculation then is the treatment of the produced meson in terms of a light cone twist-2 meson wave function rather than in terms of the fragmentation model . in our calculation",
    "we do not restrict ourselves to the kinematic region @xmath5 because we have to avoid too small invariant masses in the final quark state to justify the application of the lund fragmentation model and for correspondingly large @xmath6 the counting rates are too small for an experiment like hermes .",
    "however , in our kinematics a hard scale is given by @xmath7 with @xmath2 being the transverse momentum of the produced quark in the center of mass system of the incoming nucleon and the virtual photon @xcite .",
    "the hardness of this scale ensures the applicability of perturbation theory .",
    "the calculation therefore can be considered as a parton model description combined with the lund fragmentation model .",
    "we would like to stress that the process we are considering is not the only one leading to two charged pions in the final state .",
    "an exclusively produced @xmath8-meson for instance will immediately decay into a pion - pair .",
    "however , the cuts in our numerical analysis make sure that we only count pions produced away from the @xmath8-resonance .",
    "a pion pair can also be produced through the exclusive production of four quarks , each pair forming a meson .",
    "a leading order diagram for this process is shown in fig .",
    ".    however , one may expect that such diagrams are kinematically suppressed as can be seen best in the center of mass frame of the incoming nucleon and the virtual photon : two of the four produced quarks are obtained by the decay of a gluon taken out of the nucleon and therefore will carry a fraction of the incoming proton momentum while the other quark antiquark pair carries the momentum of the virtual photon . without at least one additional internal gluon line , which would lead to a suppression in @xmath9 , it is not possible to rearrange the momenta such that two light mesons are formed .",
    "also we did not consider the process of two gluon production and their fragmentation into a meson pair .",
    "however , it turns out that in the considered kinematical range contributions from gluon nonforward parton distributions dominate compared to quark nonforward distributions whereas only the latter lead to two gluon production in the leading order .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we define the general kinematics , give the formula for the partonic cross section and derive the amplitudes for exclusive @xmath10 production .",
    "we then discuss the models used for the polarized and unpolarized .",
    "subsequently , we discuss the fragmentation process of the two final partons into the meson pair using pythia / jetset @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned we assume that meson pair production factorizes into hard quark pair production and a fragmentation part .",
    "we treat the fragmentation process on the level of transition probabilities using the program jetset .",
    "therefore we have to calculate analytically only the cross section for the process @xmath12 the corresponding diagram to lowest order qed is shown in fig .  [ momenta ] . for the definition of the particle momenta see also that figure .",
    "we work in the center of mass frame of the exchanged photon and the initial nucleon and neglect nucleon and lepton masses .",
    "furthermore we take the momentum transfer to the nucleon to be proportional to the initial nucleon momentum @xmath13 .",
    "we have chosen the momenta @xmath14 and @xmath15 to define the @xmath16- and @xmath17-direction respectively as explained in @xcite .",
    "see also fig .",
    "[ kinem ] .",
    "the masses of the final quarks are neglected @xmath18 .",
    "recall that for exclusive production of only one particle the on - shell condition leads to the constraint that the skewedness parameter of the @xmath19 equals the bjorken variable @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this is clearly not the case for two produced particles .",
    "therefore it is natural to introduce the variable @xmath22 , which describes the invariant mass of the final @xmath23 state . using furthermore the variables @xmath24 and @xmath25 defined as the difference between the azimuthal angles of @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( see fig .",

    "is suggested ( at least for small values of @xmath69 ) by the condition @xmath72 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . as models for the form factors we take @xmath73 with @xmath74 , @xmath75 in the case of quark distributions and @xmath76 , @xmath77 in the case of gluon distributions .",
    "the quark form factor is taken from measurements of elastic electron nucleon scattering @xcite , the gluon form factor from qcd sum rule calculations @xcite .",

    "in order to evaluate the cross section for @xmath0 and @xmath83 pair production in lepton proton scattering the events generated by jetset are weighted with our differential cross section for quark pair production @xmath84 .",

    "for our simulations we work in the proton rest frame with a lepton energy of @xmath86 and use an acceptance slightly smaller than the hermes acceptance .",
    "we require the angles of all detected particles ( electrons , pions and kaons ) with respect to the electron beam axis to lie in the range @xmath87 .",

    "contributions from the polarized and unpolarized gluonic are denoted by the indices @xmath97 and @xmath98 , contributions from the quark by @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively . since the cross section is quadratic in the parton distributions we find pure gluonic contributions of the form @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , similar expressions for the pure quarkonic part , and interference contributions @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",

    "the gluon contribution dominates the cross section , both in the unpolarized and polarized channel .",
    "note that the normalization of the cross section depends crucially on the form factors ( [ formfaktor ] ) .",
    "for the used input distributions we finally get a spin asymmetry of order 10% .",
    "the cross sections receive their dominating contribution from the small values of @xmath19 . in our analysis",
    "we restrict ourselves on skewedness values larger than @xmath112 . to go to smaller values of @xmath19",
    "ultimately would lead to the requirement that @xmath113 and thus would lead to the region of photoproduction . in that kinematical domain",
    "the scattered electron is not detectable and thus an unambiguous reconstruction of the final hadronic state is not possible unless the outgoing proton could be detected by a recoil spectrometer .",
    "one method to distinguish the elastic events from inelastic ones in this case is provided by the existence of a rapidity gap .",
    "the plots in the middle of fig .  [ cross ] show that the difference between the minimum of the meson rapidities and the rapidity of the outgoing proton @xmath114 is for all diffractive events larger than @xmath115 . in the lower diagrams in fig .",
