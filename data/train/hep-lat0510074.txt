    "glueballs , predicted by qcd , are so exotic from the point of view of naive quark model that their existence will be a direct support of qcd . however , experimental efforts in searching for glueballs are confronted with the difficulty of identifying glueballs unambiguously , even though there are several candidate glueball resonances , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , etc .. the key problem is that there is little knowledge of the nature of glueballs and confined qcd vacuum , which requires reliable nonperturbative methods to be implemented .",
    "the numerical study of lattice qcd , which starts from the first principles , has been playing an important role in this hot field in the last twenty years , and extensive numerical studies have been carried out to calculate the glueball spectrum  @xcite .",
    "these studies give the result that the masses of the lowest - lying glueballs range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , and suggest that the @xmath0 radiative decays be an ideal hunting ground for glueballs . however ,",
    "apart from the mass spectrum , more characteristics are desired in order to determine glueballs in the final states of @xmath0 radiative decays , one of which is the partial widths of @xmath0 decaying into glueballs .",
    "the first step to estimate these partial widths is to calculate the vacuum - to - glueball transition matrix elements(tme ) of local gluonic operators , which are nonperturbative quantities and can be investigated by the numerical calculation of lattice gauge theory .",
    "the techniques of lattice calculations in the glueball sector have been substantially improved in the past decade .",
    "it is known that very large statistics are necessary in order for the correlation functions of gluonic operators to be measured precisely by monte - carlo simulation .",
    "this prohibits the lattice size being too large . on the other hand , because of the large masses of glueballs , the lattice spacing ( at least in the temporal direction ) has to be small enough so that reliable signals can be measured before they are undermined by statistical fluctuations .",
    "this dilemma is circumvented by using anisotropic lattices , which are spatially coarse and temporally fine .",
    "the potentially large lattice artifacts owing to the spatially coarse lattice can be suppressed by the implementation of improved lattice gauge actions .",
    "these techniques has been verified to be efficient in the calculations of glueball spectrum  @xcite , and are adopted as the basic formalism of this work .",
    "the glueball matrix elements computed in this work are of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 refers to the glueball state with specific quantum number @xmath9 , @xmath10 , or @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the gauge field strength , and @xmath13 the gauge coupling .",
    "the lattice version of the gluonic operators @xmath14 are constructed by the smallest wilson loops on the lattice . to reduce lattice artifacts ,",
    "the lattice version of each local gluonic operator is improved by eliminating the @xmath15 ( @xmath16 here is the spatial lattice spacing ) , while the glueball states @xmath8 are obtained by smeared gluonic operators . in order to get a reliable continuum extrapolation ,",
    "five independent calculations are carried out on lattices with spatial lattice spacings ranging from 0.09 fm to 0.22 fm . as by - products",
    ", we also calculate the masses of the lowest - lying stationary states in all of the symmetry channels allowed on a cubic lattice at each lattice spacing . to study the systematic error from finite volume , two extra independent studies are performed at @xmath17 with the same input parameters but different lattice size .",
    "note that the local operators mentioned above are all bare operators , they need to be renormalized to give the physical matrix elements . in this work ,",
    "the renormalization constants of the scalar and tensor gluonic operators at the largest lattice spacing are extracted by the calculations of gluonic three - point functions on a much larger statistical sample ( 100,000 measurements ) .",
    "the pseudoscalar operator renormalization is determined through the calculation of the topological susceptibility .",
    "finally , we give the nonperturbatively calculated and phenomenologically significant matrix elements .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a detailed description of the construction of lattice local gluonic operators .",
    "two types of lattice realization in each channel are defined , including the improvement schemes .",
    "the details of the computation , including the generation of the gauge configurations , the construction of the smeared glueball correlators , the extraction of glueball masses from the correlation functions , and the determination of the lattice spacing , are described in sec . iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we estimate the finite volume errors and some other systematical errors .",
    "the removal of lattice artifacts due to the finite lattice spacing , including the extrapolations to the continuum limit , is described in sec . v. the calculation of three point function and the calculation of renormalization constants",
    "are described in sec .",
    "vii gives the conclusion and some discussion .",
    "in the continuum theory , the lowest - dimensional gauge invariant gluonic operators are of the form @xmath18 , of which the most commonly studied ones are the scalar @xmath19 ( qcd trace anomaly ) , the pseudoscalar @xmath20 ( topological charge density ) , and the tensor @xmath21 ( energy - momentum density ) .",
    "they all have dimension four and are all positive under charge conjugation .",
    "the explicit forms of them are @xmath22    if we introduce the chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields , @xmath23 the lorentz scalar @xmath19 and pseudoscalar @xmath20 can be expressed explicitly by these operators , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the traceless , symmetric chromo - electric and magnetic tensors , @xmath27 the scalar operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the pseudoscalar @xmath30 , and the tensors @xmath25 , @xmath26 , are all irreducible representations of the three - dimensional rotation group @xmath31 .    denoting the normalized scalar , pseudoscalar , and the tensor glueball states as @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively , the non - zero glueball - to - vacuum matrix elements for their annihilation at rest by these operators are @xmath35 where no implicit summation is applied . it is straightforward to reproduce the matrix elements of the scalar @xmath19 and pseudoscalar operator @xmath20 by these quantities , but for the lorentz tensor @xmath36 ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "first of all , any hadron state @xmath37 is an eigenstate of @xmath38 , so that the matrix elements @xmath39 are zero .",
    "together with the traceless property ( @xmath40 ) , the above condition implies that @xmath41 is zero .",
    "therefore , there are only five linearly independent no - zero matrix elements of @xmath36 , which can be decomposed into the color - magnetic part and the color - electric part , @xmath42 due to the rotational invariance , the five polarizations give the same matrix element of the tensor .",
    "the lorentz invariance is broken on the spacetime lattice .",
    "the zero - momentum stationary glueball state on the lattice must be an irreducible representation ( irrep ) of the lattice symmetry group , i.e. the 24-element octahedral point group @xmath43 .",
    "the irreps of group @xmath43 are classified as @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which are the counterparts of angular momentum @xmath49 for the @xmath31 rotational group and have dimensions 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 3 , respectively . together with parity @xmath50 and charge conjugate @xmath51 transformations , the full symmetry group of simple cubic lattice is @xmath52 and the total quantum number of the lattice glueball state is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 stands for @xmath55 or @xmath48 , and @xmath56 can be @xmath57,@xmath58,@xmath59 , or @xmath60 . as mentioned above , we are interested in the matrix elements of the scalar , pseudoscalar , and tensor operators , which correspond to the irreps @xmath53 through the following relation : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "the zero - momentum operators are obtained by summing up all the local operators on the same time - slice in each channel .",
    "the dimensionless lattice operators are given below explicitly .",
    "the magnetic and electric scalar ( labeled @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively ) belong to the @xmath66 representation and are defined as @xmath67 while the pseudoscalar ( labeled @xmath68 ) belongs to the @xmath69 representation and is defined as @xmath70    in the above questions , @xmath71 is the dimensionless spatial volume of the lattice and @xmath16 the spatial lattice spacing . for the spin - two irrep of @xmath31 ,",
    "the five polarizations are split across the @xmath46 and @xmath48 irreps of @xmath43 and so the tensor operators must be decomposed into their @xmath46 and @xmath48 irreducible contents .",
    "the four resulting lattice operators are labeled @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , and are given in terms of their continuum counterparts as @xmath76 @xmath77({\\bf x}_i , t ) \\nonumber\\\\",

    "thus we have seven different matrix elements to be calculated on the lattice , @xmath78    however , in the practical lattice study , the operators @xmath79 ( with @xmath54 representing the labels mentioned above ) are not constructed directly by @xmath80 or @xmath81 , but by the proper combinations of different wilson loops .",
