    "let us consider that the slowly changing usual shallow decay is also due to the pulsar activity . if the dipole magnetic field is constant , the luminosity of the pulsar decreases as @xmath129 , so that we need the increase of the dipole magnetic field to interpret the shallow decay phase . from the total energy conservation , we have @xmath130 where we assume that the rotational energy goes into the magnetic energy by some unknown mechanism satisfying the observed luminosity , @xmath131 integrating the above equations from the beginning of the shallow decay phase @xmath49 to @xmath1 , we have @xmath132\\ ] ] in this model @xmath1 is essentially determined by the total energy conservation as @xmath133",
    "therefore the energy of the shallow decay phase @xmath87 is essentially the total energy of the initial pulsar .",
    "figure [ fig : ex - tbrk ] suggests that the initial rotational period is 1ms@xmath88 3ms , which is an appropriate value in this model . using equation ( [ eq : dipole ] ) and @xmath1-@xmath2 relation we have @xmath134 since @xmath135 is known from @xmath87 , the above equation tells us that the initial strength of the magnetic field determines @xmath1 .",
    "from our observational results , we found that the intrinsic break time at the shallow - to - normal decay transition in the x - ray light curve @xmath1 is moderately well correlated with the isotropic x - ray luminosity in the end of the shallow decay phase ( @xmath2 ) as @xmath136 , while @xmath1 is weakly correlated with the isotropic gamma - ray energy of the prompt emission @xmath4 . using this relation we have determined the pseudo redshifts of 33 grbs and found that the distribution of the pseudo redshifts is similar to that of spectroscopically determined redshifts . since the @xmath5 relation does not have an intrinsic redshift degeneracy",
    ", we can determine the redshift of the grb uniquely .",
    "the @xmath5 relation does not require the parameters of the prompt emission so that it may be useful to determine the redshift of @xmath0 grbs since the energy band of @xmath0 is typically below the peak energy of the prompt emission .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath7 of grbs have @xmath8 .",
    "this means an exciting possibility such that the redshift is estimated in advance of deep follow - ups and possible high redshift grbs ( @xmath137 ) might be selected for detailed observations and identified finally in near future .",
    "we discussed the implications of the @xmath97 relation for some theoretical models recently proposed to explain the shallow decay light curve . in each model , we obtain an additional condition for the models to be satisfied from the @xmath97 relation .",
    "other models including two - component jet ( granot & kumar 2006 ; jin et al .",
