    "what we can do , with large @xmath12 , is to use the range bound as early as possible . for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , corollary  [ thm : lowerrange ] gives the bound @xmath87 . using this as the target range in challis s algorithm",
    ", we can first enumerate the possible @xmath88-prefixes and then extend them by continuing the algorithm ( checking for element - wise bounds at every step ) . with the range bound , the so - called _ gaps test _ in challis s algorithm rejects many prefixes even before @xmath83 .",
