    "discrete breathers are time - periodic , spatially localized solutions of the equations of motion for a system of classical degrees of freedom interacting on a lattice . they are also called _ intrinsically localized _ , in distinction to anderson localization triggered by disorder . a necessary condition for their existence is the nonlinearity of the equations of motion of the system , and the existence of discrete breathers has been proved rigorously for some classes of systems @xcite .",
    "in contrast to their analogues in continuous systems , the existence of discrete breathers is a generic phenomenon , which accounts for considerable interest in these objects from a physical point of view in the last decade .",
    "in fact , recent experiments could demonstrate the existence of discrete breathers in various real systems such as low - dimensional crystals @xcite , antiferromagnetic materials @xcite , josephson junction arrays @xcite , molecular crystals @xcite , coupled optical waveguides @xcite , and micromechanical cantilever arrays @xcite .",
    "properties of discrete breathers , as well as of some generalizations of discrete breathers , have been studied in detail in a large variety of different models .",
    "however , apart from existence proofs and studies of the spatial localization of discrete breathers ( which is typically exponential ) , only a few general results exist . among these",
    "it is worth mentioning the remarkable result by flach , kladko , and mackay @xcite on energy thresholds for discrete breathers in one- , two- , and three - dimensional lattices ( and subsequent generalizations to systems with long range interactions @xcite and to partially isochronous potentials @xcite ) .",
    "results on energy thresholds have practical relevance , as they can assist in choosing a proper energy range for the detection of discrete breathers in real experiments or computer experiments .",
    "it is found that , for hamiltonian systems of infinite size , energy thresholds depend on the spatial dimension @xmath0 of the system . a critical spatial dimension @xmath1 exists , such that    * for a system whose spatial dimension @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath1 , discrete breathers of arbitrarily low energy can be found , i.e. , no energy threshold exist , * for a system where @xmath3 , an energy threshold exists , i.e.",
    ", there is a positive lower bound on the energy of discrete breathers .    the existence or absence of an energy threshold for discrete breathers beautifully explains certain observations made in discrete systems .",
    "one example are statistical properties characterizing the spontaneous formation of discrete breathers in cooled lattices @xcite , a second example are the power spectra observed in thermalized lattices @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the presence of an energy threshold induces a qualitative change in the quantities under investigation .",
    "the result on energy thresholds in @xcite was derived under assumptions which turned out to be not general enough to cover all classes of systems of physical interest , and neither all of the different mechanisms leading to the ( non)existence of an energy threshold . in this article ,",
    "a much richer scenario is described , taking into account a larger class of systems and , most notably , pointing out three different mechanisms effecting the existence ( or non - existence ) of an energy threshold .",
    "the conditions leading to the occurrence of any of these mechanisms will be worked out , providing means to predict the existence of energy thresholds .",
    "a flavour of at least a part of these results has been given previously in a letter @xcite .",
    "in the present article , a more general situation is considered and details and derivations are given .",
    "there are three additional classes of systems , not covered in @xcite , for which energy thresholds and critical dimensions are discussed in the present article : firstly , systems with nonanalytic potential are included in the analysis .",
    "albeit rare , physical systems with such interactions exist and are under experimental investigation , for example in the field of granular media @xcite .",
    "secondly , systems in which no low amplitude discrete breathers exist are considered . even for the class of systems with analytic potentials , these systems constitute a generic subclass , which accounts for their possible relevance in physics .",
    "thirdly , results indicating the absence of an energy threshold in systems with no linear spectrum are presented .",
    "these kind of systems have attracted much interest recently , and strongly nonlinear tunable phononic crystals showing such a behaviour are currently being constructed @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in some notation is fixed , defining the classes of systems under consideration . then , it is appropriate to distinguish between systems _ with _ and _ without _ a linear spectrum .",
    "is devoted to the first category , and the existence of an energy threshold is traced back to the occurrence of a certain modulational instability .",
    "systems without a linear spectrum are treated in .",
    "finally , in , the results for the various cases are summarized , providing a compilation of the different mechanisms which effect the existence of an energy threshold and specifying the conditions which give rise to each of these mechanisms .",
    "we consider a hypercubic lattice @xmath4 in @xmath5 spatial dimensions . for simplicity , we consider @xmath6 an even number",
    ". each of the @xmath7 sites is labelled by a @xmath0-dimensional vector @xmath8 , and to each site a state @xmath9 is assigned , where both , the momenta @xmath10 and the positions @xmath11 , are vectors of a finite number @xmath12 of components .",
    "the dynamical properties of the system are gouverned by the hamiltonian function @xmath13\\ ] ] with periodic boundary conditions in all spatial directions .",
    "@xmath14 is called on - site potential , @xmath15 interaction potential , and site @xmath16 is assumed to interact with its neighbourhood @xmath17 of nearest neighbouring sites on the lattice .    the potentials @xmath14 and @xmath18 are both assumed to attain minima for zero argument , and , without loss of generality , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast to previous related work @xcite , analyticity ( in the sense of the existence of a taylor series ) of the potentials around their minima is not required . by removing this restriction of analyticity ,",
    "additional models of physical interest are included , as for example granular media are described by means of nonanalytic interaction potentials @xcite .",
    "several of the above restrictions on the system are imposed only for notational simplicity of what follows .",
    "extending the computations to systems of different lattice geometries or interactions not only with nearest neighbours should be possible without any substantial change and are discussed to some extend in .",
    "the case of long - range interactions is not included in the following analysis . a treatment of such systems can be found in @xcite , and these results will be confronted with those for short - range interactions in .    for the sake of readability , analytic calculations will be performed for the one - dimensional case @xmath21,\\ ] ] again with periodic boundary conditions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where momenta as well as positions are assumed to be one - component ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the effect of the dimensionality on the results will be discussed in .    the existence of an energy threshold for discrete breathers will depend on the asymptotic behaviour of the potentials @xmath14 and @xmath18 close to their minima , and therefore we choose to represent @xmath14 and @xmath18 as power series in their arguments , @xmath25 with real ( but not necessarily integer ) exponents @xmath26 . for convenience",
    "we consider the powers to be of increasing order , @xmath27 for all @xmath28",
    ". some of the coefficients @xmath29 and/or @xmath30 may be zero , and in this way the expansions in can also account for potentials @xmath14 and @xmath18 having different powers . note that , by treating this class of potentials , we will be able to make statements about energy thresholds for the even larger class of potentials which have as expansions around their minima . the potentials @xmath14 and @xmath18 in are chosen to be symmetric , and this restriction is made to keep the calculations simpler and the presentation more readable , as the number of cases to be distinguished is reduced in this way . for systems with linear spectrum and in the case of analytic potentials , the analysis of systems with asymmetric potentials can be found in @xcite .",
    "these results , as well as the possibility of a generalization of our results to more general systems with asymmetric potentials , are briefly discussed in .",
    "the equations of motion following from are @xmath31 where a dot denotes a total derivative with respect to time , a prime the derivative of a function with respect to its argument .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a transform to normal coordinates @xmath32 where the inverse transform is given by @xmath33 the normal coordinates @xmath34 , like the original ones @xmath35 , are functions of time , but this dependence will often be suppressed in the following . rewriting the equations of motion in terms of normal coordinates yields @xmath36 where @xmath37\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath38 denotes a vector with entries @xmath39 .",
    "in this section , we want to refer to systems with interaction potential @xmath40 quadratic in leading order , i.e. , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "( @xmath43 denotes landau s order symbol . )",
    "the on - site potential , in contrast , can be either zero ( @xmath44 ) , or of quadratic or higher order , @xmath45 with @xmath46 . in the notation of the expansions in this means @xmath47 and @xmath41 .",
    "this setting of parameters allows linearization of the equations of motion with a non - trivial result , @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the frequency of the linear mode @xmath50 .",
    "the set of all the @xmath51 is called the linear spectrum .",
    "the differential equations obviously decouple , having simple sine waves as solutions . in the following",
    "we will be interested in solutions of the _ nonlinear _ equations of motion in the limit of small oscillation amplitudes in which the linearized equations of motion are approached .      for generic hamiltonian systems , discrete breathers , like all periodic orbits ,",
    "occur in one - parameter families .",
    "some typical choices of quantities to index such a family are the energy of a discrete breather , its frequency , or its amplitude measured at the site of maximum amplitude . in numerical studies of discrete breathers in a variety of systems with linear spectrum , the following scenario has been observed : consider some discrete breather with frequency @xmath52 outside the linear spectrum . when following the family of discrete breathers and approaching the edge @xmath53 of the band formed by the frequencies of the linear spectrum , it may or may not be the case that the breather amplitude @xmath54 goes to zero . the reverse conclusion , however , can be drawn : if discrete breathers of arbitrarily low amplitude exist , they can not be found elsewhere but in the limit @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this case where @xmath56 it is observed numerically that in this limit the localization of the discrete breather becomes weaker and weaker .",
    "this fact is illustrated in , where , for the example of the a fermi - pasta - ulam chain and discrete breathers of various frequencies , the maximum values of the amplitude are plotted for a number of lattice sites .",
    "shape profiles ( maximum values of the amplitude ) of discrete breathers , centered at lattice site 0 , in a fermi - pasta - ulam chain of @xmath57 degrees of freedom ( the equations of motion are given in with parameter value @xmath58 ) .",
    "for a system which  like this one  has a linear spectrum , the localization is exponential ( straight lines in the logarithmic plot ) .",
    "when the maximum breather amplitude is lowered ( from + to @xmath59 ) , the localization strength decreases and the solution attains more and more the shape of a plane wave .",
    "lines are merely drawn to guide the eye .",
    ", width=241,height=407 ]    more precisely , the localization strength approaches zero in the limit @xmath60 , and a transformation of a discrete breather into a spatially extended solution ( plane wave ) appears to take place .",
    "this observation gives rise to the following consider a system with linear spectrum as specified above .",
    "assume that in this system there exist low amplitude breathers , i.e. , a family of discrete breathers for which holds",
    ". then low amplitude breathers emerge from band edge plane waves by means of a tangent bifurcation .",
    "a tangent bifurcation by definition takes place when a pair of floquet multipliers of the linear stability analysis of the periodic orbit happens to collide at + 1 on the unit circle . the periodic orbit emerging from the bifurcation appears to be of the same frequency as the one it originates from , and",
    "this is exactly the situation we observe for discrete breathers stemming from band edge modes .",
    "the following three results or observations may serve to substantiate this hypothesis .",
    "firstly , in a recent existence proof of discrete breathers due to james @xcite , it is shown for a large class of one - dimensional systems that discrete breathers of small amplitude exist and that they emerge from a bifurcation of a band edge plane wave .",
    "secondly , flach has shown in @xcite that the periodic orbits emerging from the tangent bifurcation lack a certain permutation symmetry .",
    "this is consistent with the periodic orbits being discrete breathers , but inconsistent with plane wave - type solutions .",
    "thirdly , to the knowledge of the author , in the numerous numerical studies of discrete breathers , there has never been observed a family of discrete breathers in a system with linear spectrum which , in the limit ( if it exists ) of the amplitude going to zero , is not subject to the attenuation of the localization strength as described above .",
    "the above hypothesis allows to tackle the problem of the existence of an energy threshold for discrete breathers in the following way ( which is the outline of the rest of this section ) : instead of directly treating discrete breathers , the analytically more easily accessible band edge plane waves are considered .",
    "since it is the behaviour at low amplitude which will be of importance , this can be done by employing perturbation techniques . performing a floquet analysis of these band edge plane waves , criteria for the appearance of a tangent bifurcation",
    "are found and the corresponding bifurcation energy is obtained .",
    "then , the above hypothesis allows to relate this bifurcation energy to the energies of discrete breathers . in case",
    "the bifurcation energy is vanishing , no energy threshold is present .",
    "if the bifurcation energy is positive , an energy threshold has to be overcome in order to excite a discrete breather .",
    "note that there exist systems in which no low amplitude breathers are present and consequently the above hypothesis does not apply .",
    "this special case is deferred to , whereas for the following sections we assume to be valid .      at the band edges of the linear spectrum , there exist two particularly simple periodic orbits @xmath61 and @xmath62 , each with only one mode excited , @xmath63 where the excited mode is determined as the solution of the respective differential equation .",
    "@xmath61 is called the in - phase mode , characterized by identical oscillations at all sites , i.e. , @xmath64 for all @xmath65 at all times @xmath66 . as is obvious from the differential equation for @xmath67 in i , the presence of an on - site",
    "potential @xmath14 is essential for the existence of an in - phase mode .",
    "@xmath62 we will refer to as the out - of - phase mode , where each two neighbouring sites oscillate in opposition of phase , i.e. , @xmath68 for all @xmath65 at all times @xmath66 .",
    "exemplarily , the following computations will be presented for the in - phase mode only .    of a uniformly valid perturbative solution for the differential equation i , for our purposes",

    "has to be determined up to first order in @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the euler gamma function and higher order terms in @xmath76 have been neglected .",
    "this series expansion can be derived either by standard perturbation techniques @xcite or using a method put forward in @xcite .",
    "our aim is to determine the energy at which a band edge mode undergoes a tangent bifurcation .",
    "such a bifurcation implies a pair of floquet multipliers of the linear stability analysis of the periodic orbit to collide at + 1 on the unit circle , and is hence accompanied by a change in stability . in order to investigate the stability properties of the band edge modes ,",
    "a small perturbation is considered by substituting @xmath77 in the equations of motion . in the case of the periodic orbit @xmath78 ,",
    "this substitution gives rise to equations of motions for the perturbations @xmath79 which , up to linear order in @xmath79 , read @xmath80\\delta_q(t ) = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath81-v_0,\\ ] ] and @xmath51 is defined in .",
    "note that this equation has a periodic coefficient @xmath82 , as @xmath67 is a periodic function in time .",
    "this type of differential equation ( ordinary , homogeneous , second order , with periodic coefficient ) is termed hill equation , and a number of theorems concerning stability are at hand .",
    "let us briefly recall some properties of the hill equation ( for details see @xcite ) and outline how they can be exploited in order to determine the bifurcation energy .",
    "it follows from floquet theory that , depending on the values of the parameters present in , the hill equation has either stable , unstable , or periodic solutions . considering a suitable two - parameter space  in our case we choose the linear frequency @xmath83 and the energy @xmath69 , where the latter in turn determines @xmath82the regions of stable solutions display a particular shape in parameter space , the so - called arnold tongues ( see figure 11 - 3 in @xcite for an illustration ) .",
    "regions of stable solutions are separated from regions of unstable solutions by lines of periodic solutions .",
    "hence , the parameter values at which the band edge mode @xmath78 bifurcates can be obtained by determining the values at which _ any _ of the @xmath79 has a periodic solution .",
    "the tangent bifurcation we are looking for appears at the smallest non - zero energy for which a periodic solution of orbit i and a periodic solution of the corresponding variational equation , both with the same period , exist . in the following , by determining an energy expansion of the frequency @xmath84 of the periodic solution of the variational equations , and equaling it with the frequency @xmath85 of the periodic orbit , the bifurcation energy will be obtained to leading order .",
    "the periodic solutions , as well as the corresponding parameter values , can be obtained by perturbation methods . in order to apply the lindstedt - poincar technique @xcite",
    ", we introduce the transformation @xmath86 into , yielding @xmath87\\delta_q(x,\\tau)=0,\\ ] ] where a dot now denotes a total derivative with respect to @xmath88 .",
    "this change of variable transforms @xmath82 in a function which is @xmath89-periodic in @xmath88 .",
    "the energy dependence has been noted explicitly by the variable @xmath76 . inserting the anstze @xmath90 as well as the series expansions and in the hill equation ,",
    "terms of equal order in @xmath76 can be collected to obtain the differential equations @xmath91 where the @xmath89-periodic function @xmath92 has been defined .",
    "the solution of the zeroth order equation is @xmath93 where @xmath54 and @xmath94 are complex valued constants .",
    "it follows from floquet theory that , in order to obtain periodic solutions of period @xmath95 of the first order equation in the low energy limit , it is sufficient to consider only the first two terms of a fourier series of the driving term , @xmath96 with coefficients @xmath97 inserting the truncated fourier series as well as the zeroth order solution , the first order equation reads @xmath98\\delta_{q,0}(\\tau ) = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath99 the differential equation is linear , and its solutions , which are in general aperiodic , can be obtained .",
    "then , the periodic ones are found by eliminating the secular terms in the solution .",
    "this elimination is achieved only under certain conditions on the frequency , where the ones corresponding to the tangent bifurcation we are looking for are given by @xmath100 equalling the truncated series expansions of the squared frequencies @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and solving for the variable @xmath76 , the critical values @xmath103 of the energy at which a tangent bifurcation of orbit i may occur are obtained . note",
    "that , in the preceding derivation of the bifurcation energy , we have simultaneously considered @xmath104 uncoupled equations for the perturbations @xmath79 , labelled by the index @xmath50 . from @xmath105",
    "no bifurcation can arise , as this component simply effects a time shift of the periodic orbit @xcite .",
    "a change of stability in any of the remaining equations , however , may give rise to a bifurcation .",
    "we are interested in the tangent bifurcation giving the lowest value of the bifurcation energy , which implies the choice @xmath106 .",

    "since we have to demand a positive bifurcation energy , the tangent bifurcation can only occur if @xmath111    a similar analysis for the out - of - phase mode ( periodic orbit ii ) yields the expression @xmath112^{2/(r_1 - 2)}\\ ] ] for the bifurcation energy .",
    "we have @xmath113 and @xmath114 , leading to the necessary condition @xmath115 for a tangent bifurcation to take place .",
    "similar results in @xcite , derived for the case of analytic potentials @xmath14 and @xmath18 , are recovered by setting @xmath116 .",
    "it was already noted in the same reference that conditions and mirror the fact that , for a tangent bifurcation to take place , it is necessary that the frequency of the band edge mode is repelled from the linear spectrum of the system with increasing energy .",
    "the computations and results of the preceding section can be generalized to systems of higher spatial dimensions @xmath0 .",
    "the changes in the expressions of the bifurcation energies and are of small extent , and for our purposes it will only be important to note how the proportionality between the bifurcation energies @xmath117 and the system size @xmath104 changes .    for arbitrary spatial dimension @xmath0 , the normal coordinates are labelled by a @xmath0 dimensional vector @xmath118 with @xmath119 and @xmath120 for all @xmath121 . then , choosing the value of @xmath50 giving rise to the lowest bifurcation energy , a factor @xmath122 is obtained in the expressions of the bifurcation energy instead of @xmath123 .",

    "a second proof , applying a method of centre manifold reduction , was obtained by james @xcite , where existence of discrete breathers has been shown for values of @xmath147 obeying @xmath149 .",
    "furthermore , as this latter method guarantees to catch all small amplitude solutions present in the system , the existence of small amplitude breathers can be excluded for @xmath150 .",
    "recapitulating , for the fpu chain and parameter values @xmath151 , existence of discrete breathers can be proofed , but small amplitude breathers in the sense of are clearly absent . knowing that low amplitude breathers do not exist , it is a triviality to infer the existence of an energy threshold for discrete breathers .    to illustrate this result , numerical data , obtained by the continuation method described in ,",

    "with parameter value @xmath158 , breathers of arbitrarily low amplitude are observed , whereas for @xmath159 the breather amplitude , and hence the breather energy , does not tend to zero when approaching the band edge of the linear spectrum.,width=241,height=407 ]    some speculations can be made regarding the general conditions under which exclusively large amplitude breathers are observed , implying the existence of an energy threshold for discrete breathers . at the end of",
    "we noticed already that , for a tangent bifurcation of the band edge mode to take place in the class of systems considered , the expansion coefficients of the potentials have to fulfill the inequalities and for the in - phase and the out - of - phase mode , respectively .",
    "for the fpu system , the corresponding inequality was already obtained in @xcite , equation ( 3.24 ) , yielding @xmath160 in our notation .",
    "this inequality obviously coincides with the one deduced from the rigorous results @xcite and @xcite , identifying the values of @xmath147 providing low amplitude breathers . from this observation",
    ", one might deduce the following if , in a system with linear spectrum , no tangent bifurcation of any of the band edge modes take place , then discrete breathers of low amplitude in the sense of do not exist .",
    "this hypothesis , if correct , allows to deduce the existence of an energy threshold for discrete breathers from the mere absence of a tangent bifurcation of the band edge modes .",
    "in analogy to the definition at the beginning of , by the expression `` systems with no linear spectrum '' we want to refer to systems whose potential functions @xmath14",
    "and/or @xmath18 of the hamiltonian are not quadratic in leading order . in the notation of the expansions in this",
    "means simply @xmath161 .",
    "the peculiar properties of such systems have attracted much interest recently , and strongly nonlinear tunable phononic crystals showing such a behaviour are currently being constructed @xcite .",
    "in contrast to systems with linear spectrum where discrete breathers are known to be exponentially localized in space @xcite , a localization even stronger than exponential is found in systems with no linear spectrum @xcite .",
    "an upper bound on the breather amplitude is given by the inequality @xmath162 for some @xmath163 in one - dimensional systems @xcite , where the breather is centred at site @xmath164 .",
    "however , arguments by which these results for the spatial decay can be obtained should be equally applicable in higher spatial dimension , and numerical computations confirm this reasoning , finding superexponential localization in higher dimensional systems .",
    "again , as in the preceding sections , we are interested in the low amplitude behaviour ( if existing ) of discrete breathers , which in turn affects the existence of an energy threshold . the mechanism as described in , the emergence of discrete breathers from a bifurcation of a band edge plane wave , can not take place here simply due to the absence of a linear spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , it might in principle be the case that , when lowering the amplitude of a discrete breather in a system with no linear spectrum , the localization strength decreases , giving rise to an energy threshold in some spatial dimension . for lack of any better idea ,",
