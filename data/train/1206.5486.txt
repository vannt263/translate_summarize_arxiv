    "the multi - component microscopic nature of superconductivity has been established in a number of materials ( mgb@xmath1 @xcite , cuprates @xcite , strontium rutenates @xcite , iron - arsenic compounds @xcite , nb - doped srtio@xmath2 @xcite , nbse@xmath1 @xcite , v@xmath2si @xcite etc . ) .",
    "the first relevant theoretical scenarios have been discussed in the literature long time ago @xcite and later on they have been developed for various systems ( see e.g. refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the peculiar properties of multi - component superconductors appear due to the involvement of coupled electron subsystems ( orbitals , different fermi surface sheets or other elements of electron structure ) into the formation of superconducting ordering varying substantially the physical nature of the phenomenon and opening the possibilities for novel effects . as a result of the presence of inter - component pairing the certain quantities (",
    "e.g. coherence lengths and the relaxation times of superconductivity fluctuations ) can not be attributed to the initially independent subsystems and they describe the joint features of the whole two - component condensate @xcite .    in a two - orbital superconductor with inter - orbital pairing , similarly to the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , one of two solutions for coherence lengths diverges near the phase transition point as a function of temperature , while the other one is non - critical @xcite .",
    "we note also that the existence of critical and non - critical length scales in the coherency associates with the conception of critical and non - critical fluctuations @xcite in a two - component superconductor damping in different time - scales .    in the present contribution",
    "we continue to examine the temperature behaviour of characteristic lengths of a two - orbital superconductor described by negative-@xmath0 hubbard model @xcite with inter - orbital pair - transfer interaction in dependence on the number of electrons .",
    "our preliminary study has been done focusing on band filling effects in the spatial coherency including van hove singularity @xcite . however , in that work @xcite the orbital energy differences and charge fluctuations were neglected . in the present paper",
    "we clarify their role in the scaling of critical and non - critical coherence lengths and magnetic field penetration depth by band fillings .",
    "the numerical calculations have been carried out for a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "two - orbital superconductivity is modeled by the hamiltonian of the following form ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath3a_{i\\alpha\\sigma}^{+}a_{j\\alpha\\sigma } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\alpha}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{\\sigma}u^{\\alpha\\alpha } n_{i\\alpha\\sigma}n_{i\\alpha-\\sigma}\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\alpha,\\alpha'}^{,}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{\\sigma}u^{\\alpha\\alpha'}a_{i\\alpha\\sigma}^{+}a_{i\\alpha'\\sigma } a_{i\\alpha-\\sigma}^{+}a_{i\\alpha'-\\sigma } \\",

    "the intra- and interorbital interactions are chosen as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and the site energy @xmath58 is fixed at @xmath59 . in all calculations",

    "using eqs .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) we calculated the superconducting critical temperature @xmath61 .",
    "1 shows the dependence of @xmath61 on the band filling @xmath62 .",
    "one can see that the curve @xmath27 vs @xmath26 is most symmetric as @xmath63 ( see fig1 , curve ( a ) ) . in this case , the small shift of the maximum of @xmath27 towards the smaller values of occupation number @xmath26 is caused by effective hartree corrections @xmath64 .",
    "first of all , these corrections are different for various orbitals as the intra - orbital interactions @xmath65 are different . consequently , the distances between the chemical potential @xmath11 position and the lower edges of orbital bands are slightly different",
    ". therefore the position of the maximum of @xmath61 is moved reflecting the above mentioned difference which appears here due to the choice of intra - orbital pairing potentials @xmath66 .    by increasing the difference between the bare site energies",
    "@xmath67 we observe that the asymmetry of the function @xmath68 increases . in the cases ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "1 , the site energies of orbitals are closer and the influence of the hartree terms does not lead to dramatically different distances between the chemical potential and lower band edges . as a result",
    "the single peak in @xmath61 vs @xmath26 is preserved . however , with the further increase of the difference between of bare site energies @xmath69 the effect of the hartree renormalization @xmath70 becomes stronger and we observe the splitting of the single peak of @xmath61 into two maxima ( see fig1 , curves ( c ) and ( d ) ) caused by the circumstance that the chemical potential passes in the region @xmath71 two van hove singularities related to the bands @xmath6 .",
    "it should be also noted that the larger values of @xmath67 mean the larger difference between the band occupation numbers @xmath72 and @xmath73 which corresponds to the stronger hartree renormalization .     and",

    "( [ 3 ] ) ) below @xmath61 . in fig . 2",
    "one can see the plotted superconducting gaps @xmath75 vs temperature for different band fillings .",
    "note that the increase of @xmath26 changes the order of @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the energy scale for fixed temperature , c.f . figs . 2a , 2b and 2c , 2d .",
    "with that for the intermediate values on @xmath26 the gaps @xmath76 and @xmath77 are relatively close ( figs .",
    "2b and 2c ) while for @xmath78 and @xmath79 one of the gaps strongly dominates ( figs .",
    "2a and 2d ) .",
    "the latter peculiarity is caused by the chemical potential vicinity to the van hove singularity which supports superconductivity in the corresponding band .",
    "the weaker superconductivity in another band is related , at least partially , to the interband proximity effect . at the same time the band fillings @xmath78 and @xmath79 correspond approximately to the maxima of @xmath80 in fig .",
    "1 . thus , the formation of two peaks of @xmath27 as a function of @xmath26 in fig . 1 reflects the redistribution of the driving roles of bands in the appearance of superconductivity .    in a single - orbital ( single - band ) system",
    "the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath81 defines the type - i ( @xmath82 ) and type - ii ( @xmath83 ) superconductivity .",
    "the coherence lengths ( see eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) ) and magnetic field penetration depth ( see eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) ) for two - orbital model are plotted in fig . 3 for the band fillings discussed above .",
    "apart from the divergence of the soft length scale @xmath84 at @xmath27 , we observe also a maximum for the rigid length scale @xmath85 slightly below @xmath27 in figs . 3b and 3c .",
    "this is due to the closeness of the superconductivity gaps for these band fillings , see figs .",
    "2b and 2c .",
    "another interesting observation is related to the crossing point of @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in figs .",
    "3b - d this crossing appears at the temperatures very close to @xmath61 while in fig .",
    "3a the crossing point is located remarkably lower in the temperature scale . thus , there exists always a small temperature region in figs 3a - d where @xmath88 . to make the hartree - fock - gorkov approximation plausible .",
    "in this situation we found that the penetration depth in our calculations is always smaller than the critical coherence length .",
    "the negative - u hubbard model for larger @xmath89 has to be treated in a different way @xcite .",
    "] one can treat the fulfilment of the inequality @xmath90 as necessary but not sufficient condition for type-1.5 superconductivity @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite . to shed more light on the problem one has to study the character of the interaction between vortices @xcite .",
    "the larger extent of the temperature region in fig .",
    "3a where @xmath88 may be related to the interband proximity effect which is more pronounced in this case ( see fig .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that type-1.5 superconductivity can arise due to the proximity effect in a two - band system .",
    "we presented the results of band filling effect on two - orbital superconductor .",
    "the dependencies of critical and non - critical coherence lengths on temperature were compared to the penetration depth for different electron numbers .",
    "it was shown that the band structure including site energy and position of van hove singularity is important for superconducting gaps temperature behaviour as well as in the relationship between the magnitudes of critical and non - critical coherence lengths and penetration depth .",
    "we have identified a temperature region where @xmath88 .",
    "its larger extent could be associated with the presence of interband proximity effect in a two - orbital superconducting system .",
