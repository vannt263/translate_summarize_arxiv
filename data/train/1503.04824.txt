    "<S> the coalescence model proposed here does away with several microscopic details present in the collapsing polymer that could delay the asymptotic approach to scaling . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of simple scaling in coalescence thus points to deeper problems with the simple model of hierarchical collapse , in particular in the assumption of a sharply defined blob - scale . </S>",
    "<S> the coalescence model is interesting in its own right ; it is closely related to widely studied problems of coarsening of growing water drops , but differs in the initial ( polymeric ) distribution of droplets . </S>",
