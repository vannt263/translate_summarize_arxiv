    "the physics of black holes provides a fertile ground in which the confluence of gravitation , quantum mechanics and thermodynamics takes place .",
    "progress in our understanding of this confluence as well as of the specific thermal and mechanical aspects of black holes requires one to construct and study model theories of semiclassical black holes which can provide insights into the kinds of physical effects that may be present in a complete and , as of yet , unrealized description of quantum gravity .",
    "a key to one such model theory is the fact that a black hole can exist in ( possibly unstable ) thermodynamic equilibrium provided it is coupled to thermal quantum fields having a suitable distribution of stress - energy . in the semiclassical approach , such fields are characterized by the vacuum average of a stress - energy tensor obtained by the renormalization of a quantum field on the classical background geometry of a black hole .",
    "using such a tensor as a source in the einstein equation @xmath6 defines the associated semiclassical back - reaction problem .",
    "the solution of ( 1 ) encodes the change induced by the stress - energy tensor on the black hole s spacetime metric .    before a solution",
    "can be obtained however , one needs to be able to calculate the expectation value of stress - energy tensors for quantized fields in a suitable vacuum state .",
    "this task has proven to be considerably difficult when the background spacetime is that of a static black hole .",
    "indeed , to date , the only exact numerical calculations of @xmath7 on this background have been carried out for the conformal scalar @xcite , the u(1 ) gauge boson @xcite , and most recently , for the non - conformal scalar field @xcite . in each of these cases , excellent analytic approximations to the exact , numerically calculated tensors have been found , and these have been used , in turn , via the solutions of ( 1 ) , to explore the thermodynamical and mechanical consequences of the back - reaction of spin-0 and spin-1 quantum fields on a black hole @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the case of a massless spin-@xmath8 fermion has also been investigated in ref @xcite based on an approximate stress - energy tensor . in this way",
    ", one has been able to investigate the effects of quantized matter on the geometry of black holes , in a case - by - case fashion , and rather novel spin - dependent effects have been uncovered in the process @xcite . while much has been learned from these studies , it is also clear that any discussion of back - reaction in quantum field theory in curved spacetime should include the effects of linearized gravitons ( whose spin @xmath9 ) , which are expected to contribute to the one - loop effective stress - energy tensor a term of the same order ( or perhaps higher order ) as those coming from the lower spin fields .",
    "a knowledge of how gravitons behave near the singularity at the center of a black hole is likely to be crucial to our understanding of quantum gravity .",
    "one would also like to obtain a self - consistent picture of the black hole evaporation problem .",
    "however , at the present time , the calculation of such a tensor is confronted by complicated technical difficulties , the solution of which shall require a reconciliation between gauge invariance and renormalization @xcite .",
    "namely , while a complete set of solutions for the linear graviton field equations exists only in the radiation gauge , explicit renormalization has been implemented only in the dedonder gauge .    until such time as the technical difficulties associated with the nonconformal ,",
    "spin-2 linear graviton can be overcome , it is worthwhile to obtain some idea of the magnitude of the back - reaction arising from the spin-2 nature of the graviton .",
    "this , it turns out , can be achieved provided we are willing to dispense altogether with the inherently nonconformal graviton , and consider instead a conformal spin-2 quantum field .",
    "we hasten to point out that we are not suggesting to model the graviton with a conformal field , rather , we seek a concrete means for assessing the importance of spin-2 in the back - reaction on a black hole",
    ". nevertheless , it might well turn out that some of the results of this calculation could serve as a guide as to what to expect in the technically complicated graviton case .",
    "the back - reaction of the conformal spin-2 field can be calculated employing , for example , the approximate stress - energy tensor ansatz constructed by frolov and zelnikov @xcite valid for massless , conformal fields in any static spacetime .",
    "the main idea of their approach is to approximate @xmath7 by a tensor expanded in a basis containing the curvature tensor , the killing vector , and their covariant derivatives , up to some order .",
    "the resulting tensor is covariantly conserved with respect to the background metric , possesses the correct ( and exact ) trace anomaly , and obeys certain important scaling relations and boundary conditions . for a static black hole in a vacuum ,",
    "a unique ( up to a parameter @xmath2 ) tensor is singled out which should provide a reasonable approximation to @xmath10 in the hartle - hawking vacuum state .    that there can arise important features depending solely on the spin of the field coupling to the black hole is supported by results of the back - reaction analyses presented in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these do indeed indicate an important dependence on the spin of the quantum field .",
    "for example , the energy density of the spin-1 vector boson near the black hole horizon is roughly 120 times greater in magnitude than that of the conformal scalar @xcite .",
    "a calculation of the radial acceleration of a massive test particle initially at rest just outside the horizon also manifests a curious spin dependence .",
    "the acceleration is enhanced for the spin-0 scalar and for the spin-@xmath8 fermion , but can be reduced for the spin-1 boson @xcite , for a sufficiently large number ( or multiplicity ) of u(1)fields .",
    "spin dependence also shows up in the effective potential for test particles in the vicinity of the black hole leading to either an increase or decrease in the black hole s capture cross - section @xcite .    in section",
    "ii we discuss the relevant features of the frolov and zelnikov approximate stress - energy tensor needed for the present calculation and calculate the spin dependent parameters needed to apply it to the spin-2 field .",
    "the metric perturbations resulting from using this tensor as a source in the semiclassical einstein equation are calculated in section iii .",
    "the way in which the black hole mass is renormalized and how the remaining constant of integration gets fixed by the thermodynamic boundary conditions is reviewed briefly .",
    "both upper and lower bounds for @xmath2 result from requiring that the metric perturbations due to the back - reaction be uniformly small over the entire range @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the radius of perturbative validity of the solutions of ( 1 ) . in section iv , we compute the entropy @xmath11 by which the back - reaction of the spin-2 field augments the bekenstein - hawking entropy . by requiring that the field increases the thermodynamic entropy of the system , we are able to put an upper bound on the constant @xmath12 , which measures the magnitude of the quantum fluctuations of the field at the horizon .",
    "this particular bound is much more stringent than that coming from the condition of the `` smallness '' of the solutions . combining the results from perturbative validity plus well - behaved entropy",
    ", we obtain the double inequality @xmath13 .",
    "we also calculate @xmath11 for the lower spin conformal fields @xmath14 and compare these results to previous entropy calculations based on exact stress - energy tensors in order to get some indication for the accuracy of the frolov - zelnikov approximation .",
    "further insight into the nature of the modified spacetime geometry is obtained examining the effective potential for test particle orbits in section v. our results are summarized briefly in the final section .",
    "units are chosen such that @xmath15 but @xmath16 .",
    "for the case of a static black hole background with metric @xmath17 @xmath18 the tensor ansatz constructed by frolov and zelnikov @xcite takes on a relatively simple structure depending on just three spin - dependent constants @xmath19 defining the following constant tensors @xmath20 then the various terms in the expansion of @xmath21 are given by @xmath22 , \\\\ \\tau''^{\\nu}_{\\mu } & = & \\kappa^4\\,w^3[(4 + 5w+6w^2 + 15w^3)\\pi^{\\nu}_{\\mu } \\\\",

    "the general result can be expressed in terms of a certain linear combination of curvature invariants @xcite .",
    "for the case of ricci flat ( @xmath27 ) backgrounds , the trace anomaly simplifies to @xmath28 where the final equality holds for the black hole background .",
    "in particular , for spin-2 , @xmath29 , and matching coefficients between ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) yields the identification @xmath30 .",
    "the second tensor , @xmath31 , is the only one contributing at far distances from the singularity @xmath32 , and takes on the asymptotic form , @xmath33 the coefficient @xmath34 is determined from the boundary condition that _ all _ the quantum stress - energy tensors renormalized on a black hole background approach the form of a flat - spacetime radiation stress tensor at the uncorrected hawking temperature @xmath35 .",
    "the radiation stress tensor in flat space is simply proportional to a constant tensor , the proportionality factor depending on the number of independent helicity states of the field in question . for the case of spin-2 ,",
    "the flat - space limit is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the corresponding number of independent helicity states ( this is also the number of independent components of the linear graviton in @xmath38 dimensions ) .",
    "matching coefficients of ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) in this limit yields @xmath39 .",
    "the third and final tensor is finite at the horizon and vanishes asymptotically at infinity as @xmath40 .",
    "it is therefore presumably important only for the intermediate zone near the black hole horizon .",
    "moreover , the coefficient @xmath41 multiplying it can be fixed unambiguously by requiring that @xcite @xmath42 the tensor structure of both sides of this equation is identical at the horizon , so only one constant is actually defined .",

    ", we shall need a different ( but physically equivalent ) criterion for establishing the value ( or bounds ) of @xmath44 .",
    "loose bounds on @xmath45 may be established by appealing to perturbation theory , as will be made explicit in the next section .",
    "however , an improved upper bound results from exploiting the physical properties of the thermodynamic entropy",
    ". we will indeed return to this important point later on when we come to discuss the amount by which the spin-2 quantum field augments the thermodynamical entropy of the black hole . in the meantime",
    ", we continue in what follows , keeping @xmath46 as a free parameter .",

    "related to this limit is the fact that the stress - energy tensors employed in ( 1 ) are asymptotically constant ( see ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) ) , thus the radiation in a sufficiently large spatial region surrounding the black hole would collapse onto the hole and thereby produce a larger one .",
    "this asymptotic constancy of the ( renormalized ) stress tensors is , of course , not an artifact of any approximation or regularization scheme .",
    "it is simply the _ physical _ condition required in order that an observer at spatial infinity measure the correct value of the hawking temperature ( of the unperturbed black hole ) . as the perturbations grow ( in @xmath3 ) without bound , it is therefore necessary to implant the system consisting of black hole plus thermal quantum fields in a finite cavity with a wall radius @xmath70 .",
    "the allowed values for @xmath5 can be determined explicitly by requiring that the metric perturbations remain uniformly small over a certain radial domain .",

    "the new equilibrium metric has been found to order @xmath202 . by calculating the thermodynamical entropy by which the spin-2 field modifies the bekenstein - hawking entropy , we have been able to put an upper limit on one of the constants @xmath203 which parametrizes this approximate stress - energy tensor .",
    "this is done by demanding that the fractional correction to the entropy be a positive and monotone increasing function of @xmath3 , over the entire domain of perturbative validity of the solution .",
    "this has led to an upper bound for @xmath2 .",
    "( conditions that general thermal stress - energy tensors must satisfy in order that @xmath137 have been established recently by zaslavskii @xcite ) .",
    "this bound translates physically into a _ lower _",
    "limit for the magnitude of the quantum fluctuations of the spin-2 field at the black hole horizon . by demanding that the metric perturbations be small over the range in which the perturbative solution is valid ,",
    "we have also estimated a lower bound for @xmath2 , though this particular bound depends on the cavity radius @xmath5 and on the mass ratio @xmath204 .",
    "nevertheless , these limits translate , via the boundary condition ( 13 ) , into corresponding bounds on the magnitude of the spin-2 field fluctuations at the black hole horizon . in the context of the spin - hierarchy of conformal field back - reaction",
    ", the spin-2 case is clearly the most important , giving by far , the largest correction .",
    "this is manifested in the sequence of spin - dependent horizon - energy densities and is exposed in a striking way in the relative correction to the black hole effective potential .",
    "it is hoped that these calculations may shed light on some of the gross features characterizing the graviton back - reaction .",
    "certainly , the marked increase in the magnitude of the fluctuations in going from low spins to spin=2 is a feature we expect to persist in the graviton case , as well as the relative increase in the entropy correction",
