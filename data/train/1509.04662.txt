    "high - energy heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) create matter that is well described as an equilibrated system with initial temperatures in excess of 340420 mev  @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the matter is understood to be a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) with bound hadronic states no longer in existence as the temperatures far exceed the transition temperature of approximately 155  mev calculated by lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite .",
    "this qgp follows hydrodynamical flow behavior with extremely small dissipation , characterized by the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath7 and is thus termed a near - perfect fluid  @xcite .",
    "charm and bottom quarks ( @xmath8  gev/@xmath9 and @xmath10  gev/@xmath9 ) are too heavy to be significantly produced via the interaction of thermal particles in the qgp .",
    "thus the dominant production mechanism is via hard interactions between partons in the incoming nuclei , i.e. interactions that involve large momentum transfer , @xmath11 .",
    "once produced , these heavy quarks are not destroyed by the strong interaction and thus propagate through the qgp and eventually emerge in heavy flavor hadrons , for example @xmath12and @xmath13mesons .",
    "early measurement of heavy flavor electrons from the phenix collaboration in collisions at rhic indicated that although the total heavy flavor production scales with the number of binary collisions within uncertainties  @xcite , the momentum distribution of these heavy quarks is significantly modified when compared with that in collisions  @xcite .",
    "these results indicate a large suppression for high-@xmath14 electrons and a substantial elliptic flow for @xmath15@xmath16 electrons from heavy quark decays . here , and throughout the paper , we use `` electrons '' to refer to both electrons and positrons .",

    "recently , the cms experiment has reported first measurements of @xmath17  @xcite and b - jets  @xcite in collisions .",
    "in contrast to this suppression pattern found in collisions , and peripheral collisions at exhibit an enhancement at intermediate electron in the heavy flavor electron spectrum  @xcite that must be understood in terms of a mechanism that enhances the spectrum , e.g. the cronin effect  @xcite .",
    "that mechanism potentially moderates the large suppression observed in collisions at .",
    "it is notable that in central collisions at = 62  gev an enhancement is also observed at intermediate  @xcite .",
    "the possibility that charm quarks follow the qgp flow was postulated early on  @xcite , and more detailed langevin - type calculations with drag and diffusion of these heavy quarks yield a reasonable description of the electron data  @xcite .",
    "many of these theory calculations incorporate radiative and collisional energy loss of the heavy quarks in the qgp that are particularly important at high- , where qgp flow effects are expected to be sub - dominant .",
    "the large suppression of heavy flavor electrons extending up to @xmath18 has been a particular challenge to understand theoretically , in part due to an expected suppression of radiation in the direction of the heavy quarks propagation  often referred to as the `` dead - cone '' effect  @xcite .",
    "this observation of the high- suppression  @xcite is all the more striking because perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations indicate a substantial contribution from bottom quark decays for @xmath14  @xcite .",
