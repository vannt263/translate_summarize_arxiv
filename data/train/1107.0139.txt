    "the spatio - temporal complexity of turbulent flows demands a statistical description , which can be formulated in terms of probability density functions ( pdfs ) of the fluctuating turbulent quantities such as velocity or vorticity .",
    "the lundgren ",
    "monin  novikov ( lmn ) hierarchy @xcite provides a statistical framework , which , starting from the basic equations of motion ( i.e. the navier  stokes equation or the vorticity equation ) , yields the temporal evolution of the multi - point pdfs of the velocity or vorticity . as typical for a statistical theory of turbulence ,",
    "this approach has to face the famous closure problem of turbulence . when deriving the evolution equation of the single - point pdf , this equation couples to the two - point pdf .",
    "now determining the evolution of the two - point pdf involves the three - point pdf and so forth , ending up in an ever increasing number of evolution equations for the multi - point pdfs .",
    "this chain of equations may be truncated at a given level by introducing reasonable closure approximations , which express the @xmath0-point pdf in terms of the @xmath1-point pdf .",
    "however , these approximations have to be performed with great care as a too crude approximation results in serious defects . an alternative approach is provided by conditional averaging , which , for example , is taken as a starting point for modelling in the realm of the well - known pdf methods by @xcite .",
    "@xcite used this method in the case of the vorticity equation to elucidate the statistical balance of vortex stretching and vorticity diffusion .",
    "when combined with the lmn hierarchy , a truncation at a given level is possible by introducing the conditional averages of the terms appearing in the equations of motion as unknown functions .",
    "these functions then may be modelled or estimated from experiments or direct numerical simulations as recently exemplified in @xcite in the case of the single - point vorticity pdf .",
    "the advantage of this approach lies in the possibility to interpret the unknown functions in terms of their physical meaning .",
    "for instance , it turns out that the single - point velocity pdf depends on the conditionally averaged rate of energy dissipation .",
    "ever since the experimental measurements by townsend presented in @xcite it is an ongoing discussion , whether the single - point velocity pdf displays a gaussian shape .",
    "arguments in favour of this hypothesis often involve the central limit theorem , taking the velocity field as a spatial ensemble of independently fluctuating random variables with finite variances .",
    "this argument turns out to be rather hand - waving as the assumption of statistical independence is obviously violated .",
    "moreover , the same kind of argument should be applicable to the vorticity pdf .",
    "this pdf , however , is known to display extremely non - gaussian tails , which are often associated with the existence of vortex structures in the flow .",
    "when applied with care , however , the central limit theorem together with proper assumptions on the energy spectrum has been shown to produce sub - gaussian tails by @xcite .    while the assumption of gaussianity at least seems to be a good approximation",
    ", experimental and numerical measurements indicate the possibility of sub - gaussian tails @xcite .",
    "theoretical support in this direction was , in the case of forced turbulence , given by @xcite .",
    "the approach , however , depends on the type of forcing applied to the flow .",
    "this point recently was raised in @xcite , where it was hypothesized that decaying turbulence might be profoundly different from forced turbulence . in this work ,",
    "a closure for the lmn hierarchy was suggested leading to a gaussian velocity pdf for decaying turbulence .",
    "gaussian pdfs are also found as a result of the cross - independence hypothesis @xcite for both the single - point pdf and joint pdfs in the inertial range . in both",
    "works the pressure contributions are neglected on the level of the single - point pdf .",
    "the present work aims at clarifying these points .",
    "we make use of the statistical framework of the lmn hierarchy combined with conditional averaging to identify the terms which determine the shape and evolution of the single - point velocity pdf .",
    "this approach gives concise insights how the different terms interplay to determine the functional form of the pdf .",
    "the theory applies to forced as well as decaying turbulence .",
    "the results presented in @xcite can be obtained via a simple approximation , which neglects the statistical dependence of the pressure gradient and the energy dissipation on the velocity .",
    "testing the theory against results from direct numerical simulation , however , indicates slightly non - gaussian pdfs for both forced and decaying turbulence , which is related to the statistical correlations between the velocity and the different dynamical effects such as pressure gradient and energy dissipation .",
    "the remainder of this article is structured as follows . after reviewing the lmn hierarchy and conditional averaging",
    ", we discuss the implications of statistical symmetries , which help to drastically simplify the description .",
    "we then derive explicit formulae for the homogeneous and stationary velocity pdf .",
    "the conditional averages appearing in these formulae have to obey certain constraints which will be derived and used to motivate a simple closure approximation .",
    "we then turn to the numerical results of stationary and decaying turbulence examining the different quantities arising in the theoretical description . to highlight the genuine properties of the velocity statistics ,",
    "some comparisons with the single - point statistics of the vorticity are drawn before we conclude .",
    "as an introduction into the statistical framework used in this work , we start with revisiting the derivation of the lmn hierarchy . for further details ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",

    ", the identity , incompressibility and the sifting property of the delta function , @xmath19 , have been used .",
    "this manipulation explicitly shows how the single - point statistics couples to the two - point statistics .",
    "the remaining unclosed terms can be treated in a similar manner ; for more details , we refer the reader to @xcite . now determining the evolution equation for @xmath20 basically involves the same steps , leading to a coupling to @xmath21 .",
    "this eventually leads to the aforementioned never - ending hierarchy of evolution equations for the multi - point velocity distributions .    instead of establishing this chain of evolution equations , it is possible to truncate the hierarchy on a given level by introducing conditional averages according to e.g. @xmath22 i.e. now the coupling to a higher - order pdf is replaced by introducing unknown functions in the form of conditionally averaged quantities , which may be modelled or obtained by experimental or numerical means .",
    "the conditional averages may be regarded as a measure for the correlation ( in the sense of statistical dependence ) of the different quantities on the single - point level .",
    "we will focus on this approach in the following .",
    "the temporal evolution of the velocity pdf then takes the general form @xmath23.\\ ] ] to rewrite the advective term , here again incompressibility and the sifting property have been used . in this kinetic description for the evolution of the single - point velocity pdf , several unclosed terms appear : the conditionally averaged pressure gradient , the laplacian of the velocity as well as the external forcing .",
    "we take this equation as a starting point for the following considerations and will now utilize statistical symmetries to simplify the description .",
    "for homogeneous flows , several simplifications arise .",
    "first , the advective term on the left - hand side of vanishes as homogeneity means that @xmath16 can not depend on @xmath24 .",
    "this simplifies the kinetic equation resulting in @xmath25.\\ ] ] note that in the case of decaying turbulence , the evolution is determined by the conditionally averaged pressure gradient and the dissipative term only .",
    "homogeneity allows to recast the latter . calculating the laplacian of @xmath26 and averaging yields @xmath27",
    "this is a multi - dimensional version of the homogeneity relation introduced by @xcite . with this expression ,",
    "the kinetic equation takes the form @xmath28 which has also been derived for turbulence with mean flow by @xcite .",
    "this introduces the tensor @xmath29 , sometimes termed conditionally averaged dissipation tensor , which will be of central interest in the following .",
    "before we proceed to the simplifications that arise due to isotropy , we pause for a side remark as we would like to highlight the connection to moment equations which can be obtained directly from the pdf equation",
    ". the law of energy decay may serve as an example .",
    "in the decaying case , the only two terms in governing the evolution of the velocity pdf are the conditionally averaged pressure gradient and the conditional dissipation tensor .",
    "while the former takes the form of a drift induced by the non - local pressure contributions , the latter term may be interpreted as a diffusive term , however with a negative sign .",
    "this sign can be explained in a physically sound way as for a diffusion process an initially localized concentration spreads over time , eventually being dispersed over a large domain .",
    "regarding the decay of the velocity field of a turbulent fluid , the opposite takes place .",
    "an initially broad distribution of velocity contracts as the velocity field dies away .",
    "when the fluid has come to rest , the pdf is localized sharply in probability space , @xmath30 , expressing that we have probability one finding a vanishing velocity .",
    "to proceed , we multiply by @xmath31 and integrate over @xmath9 , @xmath32.\\ ] ] the right - hand side may be integrated by parts . assuming a sufficiently rapid decay of the pdf",
    ", one finds @xmath33 \\nonumber\\\\                         & = -\\big\\langle { \\boldsymbol}u \\cdot { \\boldsymbol}{\\nabla } p\\big\\rangle -\\frac{1}{2 } \\big\\langle \\varepsilon + \\nu \\omega^2 \\big\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\                         & = - \\big\\langle \\varepsilon \\big\\rangle .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the validity of the second equality will become clear in the next section ( see ) .",
    "the last equality comes from the fact that the pressure - related average vanishes due to homogeneity and incompressibility and that the rate of energy dissipation and squared vorticity ( multiplied by @xmath5 ) have the same spatial and hence also ensemble average .",
    "equation is what one expects and also what is long known as the evolution equation of the kinetic energy .",
    "it is not surprising that the correct equation for the energy follows from the equations for the velocity pdf as those were derived directly from the navier  stokes equation without using any approximations .",
    "the conditional averages appearing in and are vector- and symmetric - tensor - valued functions of the velocity vector @xmath9 . statistical isotropy , which is here assumed as invariance under rotation , imposes further constraints on these functions e.g. @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a rotation matrix . in three dimensions",
    "it can be shown that , because of these constraints , isotropic vector- and symmetric - tensor - valued functions like @xmath36 and @xmath37 take the form @xcite",

    "@xmath44 is the eigenvalue of the eigenvector @xmath9 , whereas @xmath45 is the eigenvalue of the ( two - dimensional ) eigenspace perpendicular to @xmath9 .",
    "note that because @xmath46 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are isotropic scalar - valued functions , they depend only on the absolute value of the velocity @xmath47 .",
    "the same goes for the probability density @xmath48 , i.e. it is only a function of the absolute value @xmath47 .",
    "this , however , may not be confused with the pdf of the absolute value of the velocity , in the following denoted by @xmath49 .",
    "however , there is a simple relation between those two , @xmath50 indicating that it suffices to determine the pdf of the absolute value in order to specify the pdf of the full vector .    from the consideration about isotropic vector - valued functions ,",
    "we find @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the unit vectors in the direction of @xmath3 and @xmath9 .",
    "note that it is sufficient to take the conditional average with respect to the magnitude of the velocity to obtain the functions @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this considerably simplifies the numerical estimation of the conditional averages .",
    "let us now turn to the conditional dissipation tensor , which takes the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the velocity gradient tensor .",
    "@xmath59 may be decomposed into symmetric and antisymmetric parts according to @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "these two tensors characterize the local rate of stretching and the rate of rotation of the fluid . in the case of statistical isotropy , @xmath63 is determined by its eigenvalues ( see ) , which can be obtained using the relations @xmath64 the trace of @xmath63 is determined by the conditional averages of the local rate of energy dissipation @xmath65 and the squared vorticity @xmath66 : @xmath67 the second scalar quantity needed to determine @xmath63 is @xmath68 this rather formally looking quantity has a simple physical interpretation . as @xmath59",

    "@xmath75 we note in passing that these equations can also be derived without the assumption of statistical isotropy and therefore correctly describe @xmath76 also in statistically anisotropic turbulence .",
    "however , in that case they are not equivalent to  and @xmath48 is not fully determined by @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , the relations  and are not valid in that case and do not allow a simple interpretation of the quantities @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .      because now having reduced the problem to a one - dimensional , is easily integrated yielding the velocity pdf in homogeneous turbulence , @xmath77 showing that it can be expressed as a function of the conditional averages involving the velocity diffusion , dissipation , enstrophy and the stretching and turning of the velocity vector . here",
    "@xmath78 denotes a normalization constant , which depends on @xmath79 .",
    "note that by only imposing isotropy and homogeneity , the conditional averages will be a function of time .",
    "in the following , we will refer to this solution as the ` homogeneous solution ' .",
    "in the case of forced turbulence , it is possible to maintain a statistically stationary flow .",
    "this immediately implies @xmath80 and from follows @xmath81 i.e. the pressure gradient term , the viscous term and the term stemming from the external forcing identically cancel .",
    "this also means that in the case of stationary , homogeneous and isotropic turbulence the probability current on the right - hand side of identically vanishes .",
    "note that this is not obvious and is due to the fact that the problem becomes effectively one - dimensional by virtue of isotropy . in the case of the turbulent vorticity ,",
    "this balance was discussed in @xcite and more recently in @xcite . in the stationary case , and are equivalent due to the conditional balance .",
    "the stationary solution of reads as @xmath82 and can be either obtained by solving or from by utilizing the conditional balance and omitting the time dependence .",
    "we emphasize here that introducing the second derivatives with the help of the homogeneity relation is essential to obtain a unique stationary solution which can not be obtained solely from .",
    "we now have formally identified the quantities which determine the shape of the single - point velocity pdf , however , the explicit functional form of these quantities is unknown .",
    "further input from the numerical or experimental side is needed to specify the pdf , which will be presented below , after discussing some more theoretical points .",
    "note that the equations and relations derived so far are exact as no approximations have been made .",
    "now that the theoretical framework is set up , we are faced with the closure problem of turbulence in terms of the unknown conditional averages @xmath44 , @xmath45",
    ", @xmath55 , @xmath54 and @xmath56 . in this section , we present constraints on the functional form of these quantities , which follow from elementary statistical relations and statistical isotropy",
    ". these constraints are useful to narrow down the possible functional forms of the conditional averages .",
    "we start out with the pressure gradient .",
    "as already mentioned , its averaged projection on the velocity vector has to vanish because of incompressibility and homogeneity .",
    "this in turn gives an integral constraint on @xmath83-dependence to simplify the presentation .",
    "however , we do not assume stationarity unless explicitly mentioned .",

    "however , this is possible only for the zero vector , thus @xmath89 note that the limit @xmath90 is not defined ; however , the boundedness of @xmath53 is enough for the above result . in summary , we find @xmath91 this type of argument can also be applied to tensor - valued isotropic functions . in three dimensions",
    "the only constant isotropic tensor of rank two is @xmath92 , which leads to constraints on the eigenvalues @xmath93 we can go even further and use this type of argument to obtain constraints on the derivatives at @xmath94 . for this , first note that the isotropic forms of vector- and tensor - valued functions and are also invariant under reflections .",
    "therefore , all the isotropic functions considered here are actually invariant under transformations in @xmath95 .",
    "this means that in our case , the assumption of invariance under @xmath96 yields invariance under @xmath95 .",
    "now , it can be easily checked that if a tensor - valued function is invariant under some transformations , then so are also its derivatives .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1-th derivative of @xmath97 at @xmath94 is a constant @xmath98-th - order tensor , invariant under @xmath95 . for @xmath1 being odd , the derivative has to vanish , because the only constant tensor of odd order which is invariant under reflections is the zero tensor and it follows that @xmath99 where @xmath1 is odd .",
    "with the very same argumentation applied to vectors ( i.e. tensors of rank one ) one also finds @xmath100 where @xmath1 is even .",
    "this shows that in isotropic turbulence , the series expansion of @xmath44 and @xmath45 contains only even powers , whereas that of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 contains only odd .",

    "this solution is valid for decaying as well as stationary turbulence , where @xmath107 is a monotonously decaying function in the first and a constant in the latter case .",
    "the above solution rests upon the homogeneity relation , which in the stationary case is equivalent to the evolution equation .",
    "however , for decaying turbulence , this evolution equation gives another possibility to obtain the pdf which we demonstrate in the following .",
    "for this , we choose the most simple functional form for the pressure gradient which is consistent with and , namely @xmath108 .",

    "for example , the argumentation using the homogeneous solution ( presented at the beginning of this section ) can also be applied to the vorticity field , which is known to exhibit a highly non - gaussian distribution .",

    "this means that a fluid particle will on average be decelerated for low values of velocity and accelerated for high values of velocity . if the pressure term is non - vanishing , it _ has _ to exhibit this zero - crossing , because the integral constraint can be fulfilled only through a zero - crossing or vanishing of @xmath83 .",
    "our numerical investigations show that the pressure contributions to the single - point velocity pdf can not be neglected , in contrast to the assumptions of some recent theories @xcite .",
    "this is especially true for high velocities , where we see a strong @xmath47-dependence of @xmath54 and hence a clear statistical dependence of the pressure gradient and the absolute value of the velocity .",
    "the conditionally averaged forcing term in figure [ fig : pilaphi ] was computed based on the conditional balance .",

    ". an interesting feature of @xmath56 is that it seems to saturate for large values of @xmath47 in contrast to @xmath54 and @xmath55 , suggesting that the forcing plays a minor role for the statistics of high velocities . in @xcite",

    "the conditional averages are inserted into to calculate the homogeneous pdf , and the result is presented in figure [ fig : recpdf ] . an excellent agreement with the pdf directly estimated from the numerical data is found . the same results can be obtained using as it is equivalent to in the stationary case .",
    "a comparison with an angle - integrated gaussian shows that , although the pdf is similar to gaussian , significant deviations occur .",
    "especially notable is the sub - gaussian tail , which has also been found in experiments and other numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "it is well known for a long time that the velocity pdf is similar to a gaussian distribution . however , this fact ( coming from experiments and simulations ) is _ a priori _ not clear at all .",
    "one can certainly arrive at a gaussian distribution by neglecting certain terms or assuming the most simple forms for the conditional averages ( see  [ sec : simple - closure ] ) .",
    "however , as can be clearly seen in figures [ fig : pilaphi ] and [ fig : mulaepsz ] , those assumptions are violated .",
    "furthermore , some of the arguments can also be applied to the vorticity which is known to exhibit a highly non - gaussian pdf .",
    "this shows that one has to be very careful with the utilization of such simple arguments .",
    "therefore , here we rather use the measured conditional averages to understand the similarity of the velocity pdf to the gaussian distribution .",
    "the question sought after is , how it is possible to find strong statistical correlations for the various conditional averages and the velocity , but still only moderate deviations from gaussianity for the pdf .    as already stated , there are clear deviations of the conditional averages from the simple forms suggested in ",
    "[ sec : simple - closure ] .",
    "we see that for small and medium velocities , the assumption of linear @xmath55 ( or equivalently of linear @xmath56 and vanishing @xmath54 ) and constant @xmath132 can be seen as a rough approximation . because of this",
    ", the pdf stays close to a gaussian in this range of velocities .",
    "however , for high velocities we see a strong @xmath47-dependence of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and a functional form of @xmath55 which is clearly not linear . still , only moderate deviations from a gaussian tail occur . to understand this ,",
    "let us examine again the relation between the pdf and the conditional averages : @xmath133 we see that only the quotients @xmath134 and @xmath135 enter the exponential function .",
    "as @xmath136 and @xmath44 both are bended upwards for high velocities , their quotient might still be linear , i.e. the deviations from the simple forms of  [ sec : simple - closure ] might compensate each other . indeed ,",
    "this is roughly true as can be seen in figure [ fig : integrands - analyzed ] , which also shows that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are roughly equal .",
    "furthermore , a comparison with the case of vorticity is shown , which will be discussed later .",
    "assuming for the moment a linear @xmath134 and @xmath137 yields a gaussian shape for the exponential factor in . in this case ,",
    "the second factor , @xmath138 , is then responsible for ( slight ) modifications of the gaussian shape .",
    "therefore , it appears that the compensation of @xmath55 and @xmath44 to yield an approximately linear quotient @xmath134 is crucial for the similarity of the velocity pdf to the gaussian distribution .",
    "for example , if one artificially sets @xmath139 as in ",
    "[ sec : simple - closure ] , but still uses the measured and highly nonlinear @xmath55 for the reconstruction , one obtains a pdf which decays much faster than a gaussian .    to discuss the issue of the sub - gaussian tails ,",
    "we need to take into account the deviations of the quotients from a linear and constant function .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that the deviations from gaussianity can not be solely attributed to the pre - factor @xmath138 , but are also due to the aforementioned deviations of the quotients .",
    "what makes the issue even more complicated is that the relative amount of contribution to the deviations by the two factors in seems to vary with the reynolds number , as has been checked with a number of simulations not presented here .",
    "this shows that the detailed properties of the pdf of the velocity are due to a subtle interplay of the statistical dependences of dynamical quantities such as the dissipation , the velocity diffusion or the pressure gradient .      in view of the complicated statistical dependences ,",
    "it is natural to ask for approximations which simplify the matter but still describe the velocity pdf reasonably well e.g. maintain the sub - gaussianity of the velocity pdf .",
    "it turns out that the conditional dissipation tensor allows simplifications which contain some interesting physical insights .",
    "it appears from figure [ fig : mulaepsz ] that the eigenvalues of @xmath63 have a similar functional form , suggesting the approximation @xmath140 .",
    "all eigenvalues of @xmath63 are approximately equal , which basically states that the conditional dissipation tensor does not contain any directional information and is proportional to the identity matrix @xmath141 in this approximation , @xmath63 depends only on the magnitude of the velocity , i.e. the dissipation tensor @xmath142 and the _ direction _ of the velocity vector are uncorrelated .",
    "note that this property is not a consequence of the statistical isotropy , but rather a special property of the velocity in turbulent flows ( this will become more clear when we examine the dissipation tensor of the vorticity ) .",
    "the equality of the eigenvalues may be motivated with a simple scale - separation argument .",
    "the velocity itself is known to be a rather smooth vector field varying quite slowly in space .",
    "compared to that , the gradients vary on a much shorter scale ( see figure [ fig : vortvel ] ) .",
    "the numerical results suggest that quantities like , for example , the dissipation depend on the absolute value @xmath47 .",
    "if we now assume that the dependence on @xmath47 is crucial , but due to scale separation no correlation between the direction of @xmath3 and the velocity gradient tensor exists , we may consider a projection on @xmath52 as a projection on a random direction .",
    "this immediately gives @xmath143 i.e. averaging the projection of a tensor on a random direction yields one - third of the conditionally averaged trace of the tensor .",
    "this in turn yields @xmath144 , which is suggested by the numerical results as an approximation .    as the trace is the central quantity",
    ", one may wonder if further simplifications are possible . to this end , we consider the average proportionality of enstrophy and dissipation in homogeneous turbulence , @xmath145 , which comes due to @xmath146 .",
    "it is now straightforward to ask whether this balance also holds in a stronger sense , when the conditional average is considered .",
    "the numerical evaluation of these terms is also presented in figure [ fig : mulaepsz ] , supporting that this stronger equality actually holds . as a consequence",
    ", the approximation @xmath147 seems reasonable .",
    "taking this all together , the conditional dissipation tensor can be approximated as @xmath148 depending only on the conditionally averaged rate of kinetic energy dissipation .",
    "it may be hypothesized that the approximate relations so far only hold asymptotically with e.g. increasing reynolds number . by comparing simulations with different reynolds numbers ( up to @xmath149 ) ,",
    "we were not able to clearly verify ( or falsify ) this statement ; hence , simulations with significantly higher reynolds numbers are needed to answer this question .    in the light of these simplifications , it is interesting to reconsider the functional form of the velocity pdf .",
    "equations and together with @xmath150 instantly yield @xmath151 indicating that the shape of the velocity pdf may be solely determined by the velocity diffusion and the rate of energy dissipation . as the diffusive term balances the sum of the pressure and the forcing term ,",
    "the pdf is equivalently determined by how energy is injected into the system , redistributed by non - local pressure effects and finally dissipated .     with the angle - integrated pdf of the approximation .,scaledwidth=65.0%",
    "]    figure [ fig : approximations ] compares this approximation with the measured pdf and a gaussian .",
    "we see that the above formula for the velocity pdf holds quite well for the core of the pdf , but leads to deviations in the tail .",
    "this ( in addition to figure [ fig : mulaepsz ] ) shows that the assumption of absent correlation between the dissipation tensor and the direction of the velocity becomes less valid for high velocities .",
    "nevertheless , this approximation describes the velocity significantly better than the gaussian distribution .",
    "we note here that the closeness of the velocity pdf to a gaussian can be attributed to the approximate validity of @xmath152 it describes the relation of the dissipation and the velocity diffusion , which is actually the dynamical effect responsible for the dissipation .",

    "second , in the work by @xcite , the argument for sub - gaussian tails of the velocity pdf relies strongly on the statistics of the external forcing .",
    "this effect , of course , is absent for decaying turbulence .    figure [ fig : velpdftemp ] shows the velocity pdf for decaying turbulence @xmath156 for different points in time .",
    "the results were obtained by averaging over an ensemble of 12 independent simulations to increase the statistical quality .",
    "the variance of the pdfs decreases as a function of time as the kinetic energy of the system is dissipated .",
    "however , when rescaled to unit variance , the pdfs collapse , indicating a self - similar regime .",

    "the pdf is computed from the conditional averages by , which again performs very well . on the basis of these results",
    ", we can conclude that sub - gaussian velocity pdfs are also found for decaying turbulence , which can be tracked down to the interplay of statistical correlations already discussed in the stationary case .",
    "it is interesting to study this self - similar decay more deeply in the framework of the pdf equation . for decaying turbulence",

    "a detailed analysis shows that the complicated form of the vorticity pdf depends crucially on the non - trivial form of _ both _ quotients , i.e. it can not be attributed to one of them . comparing the quotients for the case of velocity and vorticity",
    ", we see that there is much more non - trivial behaviour in the vorticity case .",
    "this leads to a highly non - gaussian vorticity pdf , whereas the velocity pdf displays only moderate , but still significant , deviations from a gaussian distribution .    in this section ,",
    "we have examined the difference between the velocity and vorticity pdfs , using the conditional averages which determine these pdfs .",
    "we have seen that the approximate relations @xmath204 and @xmath205 , which have been found for the velocity , are clearly violated in the case of vorticity .",
    "overall , we can say that the conditional averages or the statistical dependences which determine the shape of the vorticity pdf are significantly more complicated for the vorticity and hence yield a highly non - gaussian pdf .",
    "to sum up , we studied the statistics of the single - point velocity pdf within the framework of the lmn hierarchy .",
    "combined with conditional averaging and the use of statistical symmetries , this framework provides a clear - cut identification of the quantities which determine the details of the velocity pdf .",
    "the theory identifies the conditional diffusion of velocity and the conditional dissipation tensor in the homogeneous case as the central quantities of interest . in the case of stationary turbulence ,",
    "the diffusive term is equivalently represented by the conditional pressure gradient and the external forcing .",
    "exact expressions for the velocity pdf are presented in terms of these functions , demonstrating that the closure problem of turbulence may be expressed in terms of _ a priori _ unknown statistical correlations of different dynamical contributions directly related to the navier  stokes equation .    in an analytical treatment , we suggest simple closure approximations that comply with the functional constraints on the conditional averages leading to gaussian pdfs for both stationary and decaying turbulence .",
    "it turns out that the presented closure approximations contain the results recently derived in @xcite , explaining which correlations have to be neglected to yield gaussian statistics .",
    "dns simulations of stationary and decaying turbulence are then used to study deviations from gaussianity .",
    "it turns out that the velocity pdf displays slight deviations from a gaussian distribution with sub - gaussian tails .",
    "a detailed investigation of the terms arising in the theoretical framework allows to investigate why only moderate deviations from gaussianity occur in spite of pronounced correlations .",
    "unlike suggested in recent theories , we show that the pressure contributions may not be neglected .",
    "furthermore , the correlations of the velocity with the external forcing do not seem to be the main contributor to the deviations from gaussianity .",
    "the conditional energy dissipation tensor turns out to display strong correlations for high values of the velocity , which contribute to the deviations .",
    "the numerical results additionally suggest that this tensor is approximately diagonal with identical eigenvalues related to the conditional rate of energy dissipation .",
    "the investigation of decaying turbulence gives similar results , indicating that forced and decaying turbulence do not differ in a fundamental way .",
    "interestingly , a self - similar range with an algebraic decay of the kinetic energy has been observed , which considerably simplifies the description of the evolution of the pdf during the decay phase and implies a simple relation for the conditionally averaged right - hand side of the navier  stokes equation .    to highlight the genuine features of the velocity statistics , some comparisons to the vorticity pdf",
    "are drawn .",
    "the general outcome here is that the vorticity is stronger correlated with the terms arising in the vorticity equation that determine the local dynamics such as enstrophy production and dissipation .",
    "the external forcing has a negligible effect as has been found in various other studies .",
    "the conditional enstrophy dissipation tensor can not be assumed to be diagonal , in contrast to the conditional energy dissipation tensor , indicating the presence of non - negligible directional correlations .",
    "this fact may be related to the presence of coherent structures in the case of the vorticity and their absence in the case of the velocity ; however , a concise description of this fact is still lacking .    in conclusion , the approach presented above gives a comprehensive characterization of the shape and evolution of the single - point velocity pdf .",
    "although the introduction of conditional averages does not solve , but rather reformulates the closure problem of turbulence , valuable insights have been obtained highlighting the statistical correlations of the different dynamical influences and the velocity . regarding a statistical theory of turbulence ,",
    "it is interesting to see how pdfs may be expressed in terms of these influences .",
    "a theoretical derivation of the functional shape of these quantities remains a challenging task for the future .",
    "we thank o. kamps , j. llff and f. jenko for valuable discussions and careful reading of the manuscript as well as the editor and one of the referees for constructive input .",
