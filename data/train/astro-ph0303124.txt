    "it was only in 1999 that a periodic signal at 321s was detected with _ rosat _",
    "hri in its soft x  ray flux ( israel et al .",
    "1999 , hereafter i99 ; the discovery of x  ray pulsations were also reported independently by burwitz & reinsch 2001 ) . based on the large pulsed fraction ( @xmath0100% ) , relatively low 0.52.0 kev flux ( 3.05.0@xmath310@xmath4 erg @xmath5s@xmath6 ) , modest distance",
    "( edge of the galaxy is at @xmath71kpc in the direction of the source ) and presence of a faint ( b=20.7 ) blue object in the digitized sky survey 1.5  away from the nominal x  ray position , the source was tentatively classified as a cataclysmic variable of the intermediate polar class ( i99 ) .",
    "subsequent deeper optical studies carried out during 1999 - 2001 both at the very large telescope ( vlt ; cerro paranal ) and at the telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ; la palma ) allowed us to unambiguously identify the optical counterpart of , a blue v=21.1 ( b=20.7 ) star consistent with that proposed by i99 and burwitz & reinsch ( 2001 ) , and with no significant proper motion ( israel et al .",

    "b , v and r time  resolved photometry revealed the presence of @xmath015% pulsations at the @xmath0321s x  ray period ( israel et al .",
    "2002a ; i02 ) .",
    "independently , the discovery of the optical counterpart was reported by ramsay et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ten days later based on photometric observations carried out at the nordic telescope ( not ; la palma ) .",
    "however , one of the most important piece of information was obtained based on medium  resolution spectroscopy ( vlt ) of this faint object and reported in i02 .",
    "the spectral study revealed a blue continuum with no intrinsic absorption lines .",
    "broad ( @xmath8@xmath01500 kms@xmath6 ) , low equivalent width ( ew@xmath9 ) emission lines from the heii pickering series ( plus additional emission lines likely associated with hei , ciii , niii , etc . ) were instead detected .",
    "these findings , together with the period stability and absence of any additional modulation in the 1min@xmath105hr period range , are interpreted in terms of a double degenerate he  rich binary ( similar to the am cvn class ) with an orbital period of 321s , the shortest ever recorded ( i02 ; see also ramsay et al .",
    "the nature of the x  ray emission detected from  and its twin source  is still under debate .",
    "a number of models have been proposed in the last years ( for details see cropper et al . in these proceedings ) . among these",
    "is the double degenerate binary system with mass transfer model which has been proposed in two flavors : with a weakly magnetic primary ( polar  like ; cropper et al .",
    "1998 ) and with a non  magnetic accretor ( algol  like , also known as direct impact accretion model ; marsh & steeghs 2002 ) .",
    "an additional model involves a secondary star which does not fill its roche lobe and crossing the magnetic field of the primary produces an induced electric field ( wu et al 2002 ) . finally , the possibility that  and  are stream  fed intermediate polars ( ip ) seen face  on has been recently proposed under the hypothesis that the even terms of the heii pickering series might be partially due to the presence of h. in the ip scenario the 321s pulsation would represents the spin period of the accreting white dwarf ( norton et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the lack of good quality ( and statistics ) x  ray spectra has been the most important limiting factor in the study and understanding of the nature of this source .",
    "moreover , the study of the possible presence of delays of the minima and/or maxima in the pulse shapes between the x  ray and the optical band is important for understanding the emission geometry from .",
    "therefore , the optical observations of  we requested and carried out in parallel with the x - ray _ chandra_pointing offered us a nice opportunity to shed light on the puzzling nature of this object .",
    "on 11 november 2001 a 20ks _ chandra _  acis  s observation was carried out as part of the ao3 . at the same time we requested a 3hr long discretionary director time ( ddt ) optical observations at the 8.2 m vlt  u4 yepun ( the name of venus in the old mapuche language ) , partially overlapping in time the _ chandra _  data .",
    "the data were reduced with standard tools both for x  ray ( ciao package ) and optical observations ( midas and iraf ) .",
    "we used the _ chandra _",
    "observation ( longer and with higher statistics than the vlt one ) to rely upon an accurate value of the 321s modulation .",
    "this is 321.51@xmath110.03s ( 90% confidence level ) .",
    "then , the optical and x  ray light curves were folded at this period and the result is shown in figure 1 . a @xmath00.5 phase ",
    "shift between the optical and x  ray peak emission is evident , in good agreement with the predictions of the x  ray irradiation .",
    "specifically , we note that the minimum of the optical and the maximum of the x  ray are at the same phase .",
    "the pulsed fraction of the 321s modulation is 100% and 14% in the x  ray and optical bands , respectively ( consistent with results reported by i99 , i02 and ramsay et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the x  ray data were also used to perform a detailed spectral analysis and below we report some preliminary results . in particular , we checked the double degenerate model predictions , where a hot spot ( a soft blackbody as a first approximation ) is thought to be formed at the polar caps or at the equator of the primary star : this would be responsible for the irradiation of part of the companion star and of the accretion stream ( if any ) . a first attempt in fitting the data with a simple blackbody model resulted in the possible presence of a high energy tail ( above @xmath02kev ; crosses in the lower panel of figure 2 ) .",
    "however , an inspection of the _ chandra _  light curve count rate is consistent with the source being piled  up in the phase interval 0.350.85 of figure 1 .",
    "up is inherently a nonlinear process occurring in single photon counting ccd cameras .",
    "hence , corrections are not easy to be taken fully into account , and a parametrization of the effects must be considered ( davis 2001 ) .    with this in mind , we performed a pulse phase spectroscopic ( pps ) analysis adding to the blackbody component an ad hoc model ( developped at the chandra science data center ) for the pile  up .",
    "the results of this study are reported in figure3 and can be summarised as follows : the migration grade parameter @xmath12 is extremely variable and confirmed that the pile  up plays an increasingly important role as the x  ray emission approaches the peak of the modulation , where 90% of the photons are affected .",
    "it is also worth noting that the size of the corresponding blackbody is in the 1020 km range ( assuming a distance of 500pc ) , corresponding to an extremely small surface fraction of a white dwarf .",
    "moreover , the unabsorbed 0.12.5kev flux during the pulse  on of  is @xmath03@xmath310@xmath13erg @xmath5 @xmath14 corresponding to a maximum luminosity of less than 10@xmath15 erg @xmath14 ( assuming a maximum distance of 1kpc ) .",
    "there is a factor of more than 10@xmath16 between the on and off  pulse fluxes .    based on the above results we fitted the phase  averaged spectrum with weighted pps parameters . we obtained a satisfactory @xmath17 of 1.02 for 32 degree of freedom",
    "( see figure 2 and the circled crosses in the lower panel ) for a blackbody with kt@xmath065ev , and absorption of @xmath04@xmath310@xmath18 @xmath5 .",
    "similar results , although with larger uncertainties , where obtained for an annular region around the position of the source , where the pile  up is negligible .",
    "we also performed a radial profile study of  thanks to the spatial resolution offered by _",
    "chandra _ : this was found to be in good agreement with the expected point spread function .",
    "the nearly  simultaneous optical and x  ray observations of carried out during 2001 allowed us have a closer look at this source .",
    "the following preliminary implications can be reported .",
    "\\(i ) the nearly half pulse phase - shift between the two datasets is a clear signature of the fact that the optical and x  ray photons come from two different regions .",
    "this behavior is often observed in binary systems where x  ray irradiation occurs .",
    "it is also worth noting that the same level of phase  shift was measured for the twin source ( ramsay et al .",
    "2000 ; this is also true for the shape of the x  ray and optical modulations ) . in the algol  like model this is easily explained in terms of an elongated equatorial x  ray emitting region self  eclipsed by the accreting white dwarf . in the polar  like and",
    "unipolar inductor models the x  ray emitting region is at the polar cap(s ) of the accretor . in both cases a 40 - 50% of phase ",
    "shift is expected .",
    "\\(ii ) the inferred size of the blackbody component is @xmath020 km , a factor of about 10 lower than expected in the case of the electric star model ( wu et al .",
    "2002 ) , and measured in ips .",
    "however , we note that the predicted radius in the unipolar inductor model depends on a number of parameters ; a more accurate prediction will be likely available soon .",
    "\\(iii ) in order to check the ip scenario we compared the spectral x  ray emissions of  and  with a number of ip which are thought to be stream  fed or at least related to ( fo aqr , v2400 oph and pq gem ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the result of the analysis : all the data are taken from the _ asca _  database but  ( for which we used the _ chandra _  data ;",
    "note that due to the different energy responses of _ asca_and _ chandra _ , only the 0.75kev energy interval can be compared ) .",
    "it is evident how the  and  spectra stand out .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile such a difference only to a different viewing angle .",
    "\\(iv ) regardless the nature of  the number of similarities shared with  is so large that we are necessarily forced in considering them as members of the same class ( currently made up of two objects ) .",
    "finally , within one year we will rely upon new observations which will allow us to likely distinguish among the proposed scenarios . specifically",
    ", we will be able to detect any period derivative larger than about 10@xmath19 s yr@xmath6 . on longer time ",
    "scales the lisa mission will search for gravitational waves from , the strain amplitude of which are among the highest expected from known binary sources ( see phinney et al .",
    "these proceedings ) .",
