    "recently , a pqcd factorization theorem for exclusive heavy - meson decays has been developed by one of us @xcite , and applied to the nonleptonic @xmath10 decays @xcite and the penguin - induced radiative @xmath3 decays @xcite .",
    "these decays involve three scales : the @xmath5 boson mass @xmath11 , at which the matching conditions of the effective weak hamiltonian to the full hamiltonian are defined , the typical scale @xmath12 of a hard amplitude , which reflects the specific dynamics of a heavy - meson decay , and the factorization scale @xmath13 , with @xmath6 being the conjugate variable of parton transverse momenta .",
    "the dynamics below @xmath13 is regarded as being completely nonperturbative , and parametrized into meson wave functions @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the momentum fraction . above the factorization scale",
    ", pqcd is reliable and radiative corrections produce two types of large logarithms : @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the former are summed by renormalization - group ( rg ) equations to give the evolution from @xmath11 down to @xmath12 described by the wilson coefficients @xmath18 , while the latter are summed to give the evolution from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "there also exist double logarithms @xmath19 from the overlap of collinear and soft divergences in radiative corrections to meson wave functions , @xmath20 being the dominant light - cone component of a meson momentum .",
    "the resummation of these double logarithms leads to a sudakov form factor @xmath21 $ ] , which suppresses the long - distance contributions in the large @xmath6 region , and vanishes as @xmath22 , @xmath23 being the qcd scale .",
    "this factor guarantees the applicability of pqcd around the energy scale of the @xmath6 quark mass , which is our motivation to develop a pqcd formalism for heavy - meson decays . for a detailed derivation of the relevant sudakov form factors ,",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite . with all the large logarithms organized ,",
    "the remaining finite contributions are absorbed into the hard @xmath6 quark decay amplitude @xmath24 .",
    "we do not claim that contributions to @xmath0 meson decays are purely perturbative , but that perturbative contributions are important , and it makes sense to compare pqcd predictions with experimental data .",
    "it has been shown that about 70% of the full contribution to the decay @xmath25 arises from the region with @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) in the above pqcd formalism @xcite . since energy releases involved in @xmath0 meson",
    "decays are located in the transition region from nonperturbative to perturbative qcd according to the analysis in @xcite , nonperturbative approaches , such as qcd sum rules @xcite , also give sizeable contributions .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 meson decays are a subject on which perturbative and nonperturbative approaches complement each other .",
    "a three - scale factorization formula for exclusive @xmath0 meson decays possesses the typical expression , @xmath28 , \\label{for}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the exponential involving the quark anomalous dimension @xmath29 describes the evolution from @xmath12 to @xmath13 mentioned above .",
    "all the convolution factors in the above formula , except for the wave functions @xmath14 , are calculable in perturbation theory .",
    "the wave functions , though not calculable , are universal , since they absorb the long - distance dynamics , which is insensitive to the specific decay of the @xmath6 quark into light quarks with large energy release .",
    "the universality of nonperturbative wave functions is the fundamental concept of pqcd factorization theorems .",
    "it can be proved rigorously , but the proof is not the point of this work , and will not be supplied here .",
    "because of the universality , the strategy of pqcd factorization theorems is as follows : evaluate all perturbative factors for some decay modes , and adjust the wave functions such that predictions from the corresponding factorization formulas match experimental data . at this stage , the nonperturbative wave functions are determined up to the twists and orders of the coupling constant , at which the factorization formulas are constructed . then evaluate all the perturbative factors for another decay mode .",
    "input the extracted wave functions into the factorization formulas of the same twist and orders , and make predictions . with this strategy , pqcd factorization theorems are model independent and possess a predictive power .    for light - meson wave functions , such as those of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 mesons , various experimental data and qcd sum rules",
    "@xcite have provided reliable information . for heavy mesons , such as @xmath0 and @xmath33",
    ", the knowledge is still poor . in this paper",
    "we shall determine the heavy meson wave functions from the available experimental data .",
    "since two - body nonleptonic decays involve the maximal energy release that guarantees the applicability of pqcd , and their data are abundant , the decays @xmath4 are ideal processes for extracting the @xmath0 and @xmath33 meson wave functions .",
    "however , both of the @xmath0 and @xmath33 wave functions are unknown , and thus we need the additional data of the @xmath3 decay @xcite in order to determine the @xmath0 meson wave function first . after determining the @xmath0 meson wave function ,",
    "we apply it to the analysis of the @xmath4 decays and obtain the @xmath1 and @xmath34 meson wave functions .",

    "@xmath39 contributes via a charm - quark loop , from which the photon and an off - shell gluon are radiated .",
