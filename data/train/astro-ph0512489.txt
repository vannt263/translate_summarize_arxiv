    "grbs are observed to have non - thermal spectra during its prompt emission phase ( band et al .",
    "it is widely believed that the synchrotron radiation and/or the inverse compton scattering are the likely emission mechanism(s ) for grb s prompt hard x - ray and @xmath5 ray emission .",
    "the electrons accounting for these emissions are thought to be accelerated in relativistic shocks in grbs .",
    "according to the shock diffusive acceleration model , particles are accelerated when they repeatedly cross a shock front , and the competition between the particle s energy again and escape probability per shock crossing cycle leads to a power - law spectrum for the particles : @xmath6 where @xmath5 is the lorentz factor of the particle ( e.g. , blandford & ostriker 1978 ) . for non - relativistic shocks",
    ", the value of @xmath1 depends on the the compression ratio of the flow stream across the shock ; while in relativistic or ultra - relativistic shocks , which is most likely the case in grbs , analytical and numerical studies show that @xmath1 has an `` universal '' value , @xmath7 ( kirk et al .",

    ", we describe the grb spectral data set used and the process of determining the parent @xmath1-distribution . in  3 , we examine the contributions from the spectral fit procedure and the time averaging effect to the dispersion of the parent distribution of @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1-distributions derived from bepposax grbs and from hete-2 grbs , x - ray flashes and x - ray rich grbs are presented in  4 .",
    "we determine the @xmath1-distributions for x - ray afterglows in  5 and for blazars and pulsar wind nebulae in  6 .",
    "a summary and discussions are given in  7 .",
    "for our analysis , we use the baste grb spectral catalog presented by preece et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in the catalog ,",
    "the time sequences of spectral fit parameters for 156 bright bursts are presented , using mostly the high energy and time resolution data from the large area detectors ( lad ) , which covers an energy range of typically 28 - 1800 kev .",
    "all bursts have at least 8 spectra in excess of 45 @xmath9 above background .",
    "the spectral models used in fit are ( i ) ` band ' function ; ( ii ) comptonized spectral model ( a power - law with an exponential cut - off ) ; ( iii ) broken power - law model ; and ( iv ) smoothly broken power - law model .",
    "the ` band ' function , the one used most frequently , is an empirical function ( band et al . 1993 ) @xmath10 , & e < \\frac{\\alpha-\\beta}{2+\\alpha}e_{peak } \\\\",
    "\\big [ \\frac{(\\alpha-\\beta)e_{peak}}{100(2+\\alpha)}\\big ] ^{\\alpha-\\beta } \\exp(\\beta-\\alpha ) ( e/100)^{\\beta } , &                      e \\ge \\frac{\\alpha-\\beta}{2+\\alpha}e_{peak } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the photon counts , @xmath12 is the amplitude , @xmath13 is the low - energy spectral index , @xmath0 the high - energy spectral index , and @xmath14 is the peak energy in the @xmath15 spectrum ( when @xmath16 ) .    since we are here caring about the high - energy power - law portion of the grb spectra , and also because one possible source of systematic error in the spectral parameter determination arises in selecting different spectral models for different bursts ( preece et al .",
    "2002 ) , only the spectral parameters of those band function fitted spectra are selected for our analysis .",
    "one of our major concerns is to select the sample of spectra for which @xmath0 is reliably determined .",
    "the batse burst signal - to - noise ratio decreases at higher energies as a result of fewer photon flux and the decreased detector efficiency . in particular , @xmath0 may not be well determined if @xmath14 is close to the higher limit of the lad energy range , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 2 mev ) ( preece et al . 1998 ) , thus we must choose those spectra with @xmath14 much lower than @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , we select the spectrum for which 100 kev @xmath19 200 kev and the error in @xmath0 is less than 0.1 @xmath20 .",
    "this gives a total sample of 395 spectra for 78 bursts .      for electrons distribution given by a power - law",
    ": @xmath21 the emergent high energy synchrotron spectrum is asymptotically a power law function : @xmath22 for @xmath23 ( `` slow cooling '' regime ) and @xmath24 for @xmath25 ( `` fast cooling '' regime ) , where @xmath26 is the synchrotron injection frequency , and @xmath27 is the synchrotron cooling frequency above which the synchrotron energy loss becomes important .",
    "the spectral index , @xmath1 , of shock accelerated electrons is associated with the high - energy power - law photon index , @xmath0 , of grb photon spectrum , by either @xmath28 ( `` fast cooling '' regime ) or @xmath29 ( `` slow cooling '' regime ) depending on relative positions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 and on which portion of the spectrum is detected .",
    "there is one regime , @xmath32 , in which @xmath33 , independent on @xmath1 .",
    "this case can be ruled out by discarding those spectra with @xmath34 from our sample .",
    "we found only one with @xmath35 in the batse sample of 395 spectra and discarded it .",
    "piran ( 2004 ) argues that the fast cooling must take place during the grb prompt phase and the reasons are : ( i ) the relativistic shocks must radiate their energy efficiently , to avoid a serious inefficiency problem ; ( ii ) the electrons must cool rapidly in order that the fast variability could be observed .",
    "but there is no firm evidence to date that could rule out the slow cooling case for the grb itself , since it is difficult to measure the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 for a specific burst .",
    "thus in our analysis , we assume that each grb spectrum above @xmath14 could be in either slow cooling or fast cooling regime , so as to minimize the width of @xmath1 distribution .",
    "first we plot distribution of @xmath1 by assuming all spectra are in fast cooling regime .",
    "then we make the distribution narrower by relaxing this constraint .",
    "basically the narrowing process is to move some left - hand part of the distribution to the right by adding 1 to @xmath1 and assuming this part of sample are in slow cooling regime , since there is a difference of 1 about @xmath1 value between the two regimes .",
    "the algorithm used is described below .",
    "several algorithms are implemented to get the narrowest distribution . in the most straightforward one",
    ", each spectra has the freedom of calculating @xmath1 from @xmath0 either in `` fast cooling '' or `` slow cooling '' regime , so the number of possible distributions is @xmath38 for a sample of @xmath39 spectra .",
    "the distribution having the smallest standard deviation is chosen as the narrowest one .",
    "this algorithm works well only for @xmath40 because of the computer program running time . for @xmath41 , we divide the overall range of the sample s @xmath0 distribution into 20 equal - width bins and treat the spectra with @xmath0 s located in each bin indistinguishably .",
    "then we apply the first algorithm to the 20 bins . in an alternative algorithm , we start with the histogram of @xmath1 calculated in the `` fast cooling '' regime and mark a demarcation line within and close to the lower limit of the range of @xmath1",
    ". then all @xmath1 s at left to the line in the histogram are moved to right by adding 1 to @xmath1 , and the new histogram s standard deviation is calculated .",
    "repeat it after shifting the demarcation line rightward by a step of 0.01 on the @xmath1-axis . finally the smallest standard deviation , hence the narrowest distribution , is found .",
    "it turns out that both algorithms give the same results for most of the samples presented in this paper . for one sample where minor difference exists between two algorithms results , we use the narrower one .",
    "we show the results of the analysis for batse bursts in figure 1 .",
    "note that all the errors presented in this paper are at 1 @xmath9 level .",
    "the parent distribution of @xmath1 for batse bursts has a width of 0.54 at a 14-@xmath9 confidence level .",
    "the method that estimates the mean and the width of the parent distribution of @xmath1 is described below .",
    "note that the mean value of @xmath1 is @xmath18 3 , substantially larger than that for the distribution before the minimization , which is an artifact of choosing some of the spectra to be in the `` slow cooling '' regime , equivalent to moving the left part of the histograms in the upper panels rightward , in order to minimize the width of the distribution .",
    "the observed distribution of @xmath1 plotted in fig .",
    "1 is a convolution of the measurement error distribution and the true distribution ( or parent distribution ) of @xmath1 s . what we want to know is the true distribution @xmath1 .",
    "we use the maximum likelihood method to estimate the true @xmath1-distribution .",
    "let us say the true distribution of @xmath1 is gaussian , @xmath42.\\ ] ] further , we assume the measurement errors have gaussian distributions too .",
    "then the probability distribution for any one measurement @xmath43 is the convolution of two gaussians , which is the gaussian @xmath44.\\ ] ] the likelihood function for the set of @xmath45 measurements @xmath46 is @xmath47.\\ ] ] the principle of the maximum likelihood estimate is that , the best estimates of @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the ones that maximize @xmath50 . take @xmath51 then the maximum occurs when the following equations @xmath52 @xmath53 have their solution at @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where `` @xmath56 '' symbolizes the best estimation of the parameters .",
    "if we assume that the distribution of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are both gaussian , then one can show that the variances of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are @xmath59^{-1},\\ ] ] @xmath60^{-1},\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "so the best estimate of the parameters of true distribution of @xmath1 are obtained by numerically solving equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) , and their associated errors are calculated through equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) .",
    "preece et al . ( 2000 ) carried out a band function fit to grb spectra observed by batse , and this way determine the high energy power - law index ( @xmath0 ) and the random error in @xmath0 due to error in the observed spectral energy distribution .",
    "there is also a systematic error in @xmath0 resulting from the finite bandwidth of the batse detector , which was not reported in preece et al . , and we estimate it here .",
    "the purpose of this exercise is to estimate the contribution of this systematic error , and its dependence on the peak of the spectrum ( @xmath14 ) , to the dispersion in the @xmath1-distribution .",
    "the systematic error arises because the synchrotron spectrum does not make a sharp transition from one power - law index to another when one crosses a characteristic frequency .",
    "in particular , the steepening of the spectrum to @xmath61 above the synchrotron and cooling frequencies does not occur suddenly at @xmath14 , but instead the spectrum approaches this theoretical value asymptotically at @xmath62 .",
    "since the spectrum is observed in a finite energy range , the measured spectral index will always be somewhat smaller than the true asymptotic value by an amount that depends on the ratio of @xmath17 and @xmath14 ( @xmath17 is the highest energy photon that the detector is sensitive to ) .",
    "the larger the @xmath63 is the smaller the systematic error in @xmath0 would be , and this dependence on @xmath14 causes some broadening of the observed @xmath0 distribution .    to estimate this systematic error we generate synthetic spectra with different values for @xmath14 , and carry out a band function fit to the synthetic spectra to determine @xmath0 and its deviation from the true asymptotic value .",
    "the synthetic synchrotron spectra is calculated for a relativistic homogeneous shell .",
    "the electron distribution function behind the shock is taken to be a single power - law function : @xmath64 , for @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the minimum electron energy after they cross the shock front . the magnetic field in the shell",
    "is taken to be uniform and the energy density is the field is some fraction ( @xmath67 ) of the thermal energy density of the shocked fluid ; @xmath37 and @xmath67 are chosen so that the peak of the spectrum , @xmath14 , is at some desired value . as electrons move down - stream from the shock front they cool via the synchrotron and inverse - compton processes , and their distribution function",
    "is modified .",
    "we calculate the effect of this cooling on electron distribution functions using a self consistent scheme described in panaitescu & m@xmath68sz@xmath69ros ( 2000 ) and mcmahon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum , for a given electron distribution , in the shell comoving frame is calculated as described in detail by sari et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( also see section 2.2 ) .",
    "the spectrum in the observer frame is calculated by integrating the spectral emissivity in the comoving frame over the equal - arrival - time surface as described in kumar & panaitescu ( 2000 ) .",
    "errors are then added to this spectrum in a way that mimics the real grb spectrum .",
    "the synthetic spectrum for a known @xmath1 is fitted to the band function in a finite energy range corresponding to the batse energy coverage . by varying @xmath14 of the generated spectra",
    "we determine the discrepancy between fitted value and `` true '' value of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath63 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 .",
    "we find the fit always gives a smaller @xmath0 ( in absolute value ) than the true asymptotic value and that the `` observed '' @xmath0 does indeed depend on @xmath17 .",
    "the error in @xmath0 is about 10% when @xmath63 is order unity , whereas the error is @xmath705% when @xmath63 @xmath70 20 .",
    "the error also depends on the @xmath1 value as shown in figure 2 ; for @xmath14 located between 100 kev to 200 kev , @xmath17= 1.8 mev , and @xmath1= 2.5 , the contribution of this systematic error to the dispersion in @xmath0 is less than 1.3%  the corresponding contribution to the dispersion in @xmath1 is @xmath71 .",
    "we have also carried out a similar calculation for the synchrotron self- inverse - compton ( ssc ) spectrum for a population of synchrotron electrons .",
    "the incident photons are the synchrotron photons due to the same population of electrons that contribute to inverse - compton scatterings .",
    "the synchrotron radiation is taken to be homogeneous and isotropic in the shell comoving frame , and its spectrum is calculated as described above .",
    "the overall ssc spectrum is obtained by the convolution of the synchrotron spectrum and electron energy distribution using equation ( 7.28 a ) in rybicki & lightman ( 1979 ) .",
    "the curvature in the ssc spectrum is due to the convolution of the incident spectrum and the electron distribution , and we find that the asymptotic value for the ssc power - law index is reached when @xmath72 100 .",
    "for this reason we find that for the ssc case , the systematic error in @xmath0 is @xmath70 13% for the typical @xmath63 in batse bursts .",
    "the dispersion in @xmath1 caused by @xmath14 being distributed between @xmath14= 100 kev to @xmath14= 200 kev is , however , small  @xmath73 .",
    "these results show that the discrepancy between the fitted value and the `` true '' value of @xmath0 is small and dependent on @xmath63 , but its dependence on @xmath63 is too small to account for the observed dispersion in the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "another source of systematic error in @xmath0 is the time - averaging of multiple spectra undergoing spectral evolution , i. e. , @xmath14 evolving with flux ( ford et al .",
    "1995 , crider et al .",
    "the flux - weighted time - averaging of multiple ` band ' spectra may distort the intrinsic high - energy power law .    to examine this effect ,",
    "we select batse time - resolved spectra with @xmath14 in 100 - 200 kev and in 200 - 300 kev , respectively , divide them into non - evolving groups and evolving groups , and analyze their @xmath1 distributions separately .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 .",
    "we find the evolving spectra groups tend to have flatter @xmath1 or @xmath0 , which may be an outcome the time - averaging effect . but the widths of @xmath1 distributions for two groups are consistent with each other , showing that the time - averaging does not contribute to observed dispersion in @xmath1 in figure 1 .",
    "the time - averaging effect is further examined when we use an early batse spectral catalog by band et al .",
    "( 1993 ) in which the time - integrated spectrum of each burst is fitted with the ` band ' function .",
    "we restrict our samples to those with @xmath74 300 kev , and error in @xmath0 less than 0.1 @xmath20 , which gives a sample of 32 spectra from the catalog of 54 grbs .",
    "the @xmath1 distribution is shown in figure 3 .",
    "comparing with figure 1 , one can see that it has approximately the same @xmath75 as that for the time - resolved grb spectra .",
    "this supports that the time - averaging effect has no impact on the observed dispersion in @xmath1 .",
    "we also analyzed a sample of 11 grbs observed by bepposax .",
