    "this paper considers the issue of fubini s theorem and non - linear polynomial changes of variables for integration over a two - dimensional local field ( that is , a complete discrete valuation field @xmath0 with residue field @xmath1 a usual local field ) .",
    "integration over such fields was first considered by fesenko @xcite , then by kim and lee @xcite .",
    "hrushovski and kazhdan @xcite @xcite then developed a very general integration theory on valued fields using model theory ; their methods are valid for residue characteristic zero ( and sufficiently large positive characteristic ) .",
    "the author @xcite has reformulated fesenko s work to provide a new perspective which appears to be useful in treating problems such as fubini s theorem .",
    "a satisfactory theory of translation - invariant integration on algebraic groups over two dimensional local fields should lead to significant advances in the representation theory of such groups .",
    "kim and lee consider this problem in @xcite and construct a translation - invariant measure on @xmath2 .",
    "the methods of hrushovski and kazhdan yield all main results under the restriction on the characteristic .",
    "the author extended @xcite his methods of @xcite to obtain a translation invariant integral on @xmath2 which lifts in a natural sense the usual haar integral on @xmath3 .",
    "a relation between this theory and quantum physics is evidenced by the two - dimensional local field @xmath4 .",
    "subspaces of this space such as @xmath5 $ ] may be identified with subspaces of the space of continuous paths in the plane .",
    "the feynman integral is not understood rigorously ( see @xcite for discussion of the problems ) and measure theory on these path spaces may help to explain it .",
    "further evidence of the relations between quantum field theory and the measure on these fields may be found in sections 16 , 18 of @xcite and example 5.6 of @xcite .    to extend the approach in @xcite from @xmath6 to an arbitrary algebraic group",
    "it is necessary to have a theory of integration on finite dimensional vector spaces over @xmath0 which behaves well under certain _ non - linear _ changes of variable ( for the @xmath6 theory , linear changes of variable suffice ) .",
    "moreover , for use in applications , it is essential that fubini s theorem concerning repeated integrals is valid .",
    "this paper considers the problem of establishing whether the equality @xmath7 holds for appropriate functions @xmath8 and polynomials @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the methods used appear to be suitable for changes of variables much more general than @xmath10 . in the first section of the paper we summarise the integration theory of @xcite . given a haar integrable function @xmath11 ,",
    "let @xmath12 be the lift of @xmath13 to @xmath0 which vanishes outside @xmath14 and satisfies @xmath15 for @xmath16 ; functions expressible as finite sums of functions of the form @xmath17 for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath13 haar integrable on @xmath1 , are said to be integrable on @xmath0 .",
    "a translation invariant @xmath20-valued integral @xmath21 is defined for such functions .    in the second section",
    "we discuss the extension of this integration theory to @xmath22 . given a haar integrable function @xmath23 , let @xmath12 be the lift to @xmath22 which vanishes outside @xmath24 .",
    "taking translations and scaling of such function by @xmath22 and @xmath25 obtains a space of functions similar to the analogous space for @xmath0 .",
    "however , is appears that there are many more functions @xmath26 for which @xmath27 that is , for which both repeated integrals make sense according to the integration theory of @xmath0 and the two repeated integrals have the same value .",
    "the third section describes the action of polynomials on @xmath0 .",
    "given a polynomial @xmath28 $ ] , and a translated fractional ideal @xmath29 , we show how to write @xmath30 as a finite disjoint union of translated fractional ideals ; here @xmath31 is a local parameter of @xmath0 as a discrete valuation field .",
    "if @xmath32 is one of these translated fractional ideals , it is also important to understand the behaviour of the function @xmath33 these results ( indeed , the whole paper ) are closely related to ramification theory of two - dimensional local fields through a.  abbes and t.  saito s theory of ramification for complete discrete valuation fields with imperfect residue field ; a summary of their theory is given towards the end of section three , and further relations explained throughout the remainder of the paper .    the impetus of this paper is conjecture [ conjecture ] , which we rapidly reduce to the following : if @xmath13 is a schwartz - bruhat function on @xmath34 , @xmath12 is defined as above , and @xmath35 $ ] is a polynomial , then surely @xmath36 in section five the conjecture is shown to be true if @xmath9 is linear or if all coefficients of @xmath9 belong to @xmath14 .",
    "the technically difficult case of when @xmath9 contains coefficients not in @xmath14 is taken up in section six .",
    "introduce a polynomial @xmath37 $ ] and integer @xmath38 by the three conditions @xmath39 , @xmath40 $ ] , and @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "we give explicit expressions for the integral of @xmath42 in terms of the decomposition of sets of the form @xmath43 ; the conjecture easily follows if @xmath44 so long as @xmath45 , the image of @xmath46 in @xmath47 $ ] , is not a purely inseparable polynomial .",
    "when @xmath48 calculations become difficult , and the function @xmath49 can fail to be integrable , meaning that the conjecture fails ; however , we present examples suggesting that the space of integrable functions could be extended so as to remedy this deficit .",
    "we then consider the possibility that @xmath1 has positive characteristic and @xmath45 is purely inseparable .",
    "when @xmath44 it is shown that @xmath50 but @xmath51 so if @xmath13 has non - zero haar integral over @xmath34 then the conjecture drastically fails .",
    "this fascinating result provides an explicit example to show that the work of hrushovski and kazhdan really can fail in positive characteristic , and we discuss its relationship with ramification theory .    in the final section we summarise",
    "the results obtained and discuss future work .",

    "studies under i.  fesenko , and i am grateful to him for many interesting discussions surrounding adlic analysis .",
    "later , g.  yamashita kindly read the first version of this paper in detail and introduced me to the ramification theory of a.  abbes and t.  saito , which i began to study while travelling abroad in the final year of my phd .",

    "recall that the existence and equality of the repeated integrals of a complex valued function on @xmath93 does not imply its integrability on @xmath93 ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "however , in our applications we will restrict to well enough behaved functions for this subtle problem to be irrelevant .",

    "we will also follow the habit used in the previous lemma of denoting a constant function on @xmath114 by the value it assumes .",
    "much of this paper is concerned with the problem of explicitly decomposing the preimage of a set under a polynomial and describing the resulting residue field approximations .",
    "here is a example to illustrate the ideas :    set @xmath132 and assume @xmath133 .",

    "we now turn to generalising the example to an arbitrary polynomial ; for later applications to integration the following results will allow us to reduce calculations to the residue field , where we change variable according to the residue field approximation polynomials for example , and then return to @xmath0 .    the first decomposition result treats the non - singular part of the polynomial , and is really just a rephrasing of hensel s lemma :    [ proposition_non_singular_decomposition ] let @xmath149 be a polynomial with coefficients in @xmath14 , of degree @xmath150 and with non - zero image in @xmath117 $ ] ; let @xmath151 .    1 .",

    "therefore @xmath204 , and it becomes clear how the induction should proceed .",

    "we discuss the function of @xmath59 given by @xmath475 note that the assumption that @xmath13 is fubini implies that @xmath452 is defined ( i.e. not infinite ) for all @xmath476 .",
    "we will prove the following :        let @xmath479 and assume that there is a non - singular solution to @xmath480 . the inverse function theorem for complete fields ( see e.g. @xcite ) implies that there exists an open disc @xmath481 , open discs @xmath482 , and @xmath59-analytic maps @xmath483 , @xmath484 ( that is , representable in @xmath485 by a convergent power series ) with the following properties :    1 .",

    "informally , the @xmath488 parametrise the non - singular solutions of @xmath492 , for @xmath491 .    for @xmath491 , we deduce that @xmath502 and so @xmath503 by fubini s theorem and an analytic change of variables @xmath504 . an elementary introduction to change of variables in integrals over non - archimedean fields",
