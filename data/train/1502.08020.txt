    "<S> we present a universal relation between the flow of a renyi entropy and the full counting statistics of energy transfers . </S>",
    "<S> we prove the exact relation for a flow to a system in thermal equilibrium that is weakly coupled to an arbitrary time - dependent and non - equilibrium system . </S>",
    "<S> the exact correspondence , given by this relation , provides a simple protocol to quantify the flows of shannon and renyi entropies from the measurements of energy transfer statistics .    </S>",
    "<S> exact correspondences between seemingly different concepts play important role in all fields of physics . </S>",
    "<S> an example is the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which states that the linear response of a system to externally applied forces corresponds to the system fluctuations . in the last decade </S>",
    "<S> , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem has initiated important developments in quantum transport , quantum computation , and other similar phenomenological theories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this theorem can be extended to nonlinear responses @xcite and to full counting statistics ( fcs ) @xcite , giving more extended sets of such relations similar to crooks formula @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a relation similar to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem that provides an exact correspondence between the flows of renyi entropy and fcs of energy transfers .    in transport theory , stationary flow of a physical quantity can take place from a system into an infinitely large system . in the case a quantity is locally conserved in each system , its flow is determined only by interaction between the two systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the traditional examples include electric current , which is the flow of charge , and energy flow . moreover , there are other conserved quantities which are not physical in a strict sense . </S>",
    "<S> an example is the generalization of entropy by renyi into @xmath0 , with @xmath1 being the probability to be in state @xmath2 and arbitrary @xmath3 , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantum generalization of the renyi entropy is obviously conserved in a system under hamiltonian evolution , with the hamiltonian involving only the degrees of freedom of this system @xcite . for a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> this entropy corresponds to the difference of free energies , i.e. , @xmath5 . in non - equilibrium thermodynamics , </S>",
    "<S> the renyi entropies have already been considered @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they have been studied in strongly interacting systems , in particular spin chains .    </S>",
    "<S> the renyi entropies in quantum physics are considered unphysical , or non - observable , due to their nonlinear dependence on density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> so is the shannon entropy , which is derived from the renyi entropy @xmath6 , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such quantities can not be determined from immediate measurements ; instead their quantification seems to be equivalent to determining the density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this requires reinitialization of the density matrix between many successive measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the flows of renyi entropy between systems @xmath7 are the conserved measures of non - physical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the same pertains to shannon entropy flow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting and non - trivial question is : is there any relation between the flows of renyi entropy and the physical flows ? </S>",
    "<S> an idea of such relation was first put forward by levitov and klich in @xcite , where they proposed that the shannon entropy flow can be quantified from the measurement of full counting statistics ( fcs ) of charge transfers . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of this relation is restricted to vanishing temperature and obviously to the systems where interaction occurs by means of charge transfer . </S>",
    "<S> this has been further elaborated in @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a relation which is similar in spirit . </S>",
    "<S> it gives a correspondence between the flows of renyi and shannon entropies and the fcs of energy transfer in the limit of weak coupling . from analysis of the previous results for entropy production in quantum point contact and </S>",
    "<S> more general perturbative derivations in @xcite , the shannon entropy flow is known to be proportional to heat flow in the absence of external forces . </S>",
    "<S> this is violated in higher - order perturbation series . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the exact correspondence does not hold for strong coupling limit . </S>"
