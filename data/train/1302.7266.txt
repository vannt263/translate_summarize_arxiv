    "adiabatic control ( ac ) of atomic quantum states ( see  @xcite and references therein ) is a powerful technique in quantum optics that allows various applications in nonlinear optics , such as high harmonic generation  @xcite , multiphoton ionization  @xcite , nonlinear frequency conversion  @xcite and several transparency effects  @xcite . the general aim of ac is to create a given population distribution among the working levels of atomic systems in a robust way using a limited number of laser pulses .",
    "the control is achieved by adiabatically tuning one of the parameters of the atom - laser interaction in time , which drives the atomic populations along the adiabatic states of the system  @xcite .",
    "if the evolution takes place along the dark state ( population trapping ) , complete population control can be achieved without excitation of the atom .",
    "this mechanism is the basis of the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap )  @xcite . in the ac schemes based on stirap ,",
    "two ( or more ) time - shifted laser pulses with constant carrier frequencies are applied to a quantum system resulting in adiabatic altering of couplings between the laser fields and the atomic transitions .",
    "frequency chirped ( fc ) laser pulses applied in the atom - laser interaction represents another possibility for performing ac . in this case , it is the frequency of the driving electromagnetic field(s ) that is a key parameter governing the rearrangement of the atomic population among its quantum states .",
    "although no perfect population trapping in ground states can be realized when ac is performed by fc pulses ( like in the stirap - based schemes ) , numerous ac schemes were proposed with negligible atomic excitation@xcite .",
    "the main advantage of these schemes is that due to the frequency chirp , they are not sensitive to resonance conditions and may be successfully utilized in media with both homogeneously and inhomogeneously broadened transition lines  @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned works generally concentrate on ac in single atoms and neglect the back - action of the atoms on the laser fields along with other propgationg effects , such as interaction of the laser pulses with each other .",
    "the latter effects , however have to be taken into account when ac is performed in an optically thick medium  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "preparation of the atoms of a medium in coherent superposition of the quantum states may significantly modify its optical properties leading to very interesting and important propagation effects , like electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) . in the eit - based schemes",
    "( see  @xcite and references therein ) , an intense laser - pulse ( of constant carrier frequency ) renders the whole medium transparent for a weak probe pulse in raman resonance with the intense one .",
    "a nearly lossless propagation was also demonstrated for a _ single _ fc laser pulse in optically thick media consisting of atoms with lambda - type structure of working levels ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : lambda ] ) ) ( lambda - atoms )  @xcite .",
    "the two above mentioned schemes agree in the point that for even significant propagation distances , basically the same population - control mechanism is established in the atoms of the extended media , as it takes place for a single atom .",
    "the explanation is that the initial preparation of the atoms in the medium in both cases corresponds to a dark superposition of the ground states .",
    "this means that no excitation occurs in the atoms during the interaction , which significantly reduces the back - action of the atoms on the laser field . on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that for a sufficiently intense laser pulse pair having constant frequencies in raman - resonance with lambda - structured atoms , it is not indispensible that the atoms of the medium are initially prepared in the dark state : the envelopes of the laser pulses become distorted after propagating some distance in the medium in such a way that the initial preparation of the atoms correspond to a dark state forthe pulse - pair . in this sence ,",
    "the interacting laser pulses become _ matched _ to each other through the interaction with the atoms of the medium  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the question whether there is a matching effect for frequency - modulated laser - pulse pairs as well ?",
    "we analyze the propagation of a fc pulse pair in an optically thick medium consisting of lambda - structured atoms in case of raman - resonant coupling .",
    "we are interested in the physical mechanism of population dynamics in atoms of the optically thick medium in the field of the pair of strong fc laser pulses with emphasis on possibilities of ac of the coherence between the two ground states of the atom .    as it was shown in our earlier work ,  @xcite , the action of a pair of strong raman - resonant fc pulses on a single atom results in adiabatic excitation of the bright component of the superposition of the ground states leaving intact the dark component of this superposition .",
    "as a result , a coherent superposition of the ground states is robustly created along with excitation of the atom .",
    "this excitation , however , is detrimental for the created coherence : one has to transfer the population of the excited state to another ground state to preserve the created coherence from the destructive effect of the spontaneous decay . in the present investigation , we show that the raman - resonant fc pulse pair , which would cause large excitation in a single atom , is modified by the medium in such a way that it no longer causes any significant excitation , and induces a coherent redistribution of the populations among the ground states of the atoms of the medium .",
    "it turns out that the matched propagation of the frequency - chirped pulse pair posesses an important feature which is not typical for the matched propagation of pulses with constant carrier frequencies .",
    "namely , the fc pulse pair , while propagating in a quasi - lossless way in the medium , prepares its atoms in a well - defined superposition of the metastable ground states .",
    "the created coherent superposition can be controlled by the peak amplitudes of the interacting laser pulses .",
    "the robust creation of ( maximum ) coherence between the ground states of the atoms in an extended optically thick medium for applications in nonlinear frequency conversion processes is an important motivation of this investigation .",

    "both the pulse envelopes and the time function of the phases of the pulses are modified by the interaction with the medium in such a way that instead of exciting the atom , the pulses drive the main part of the population into the @xmath135 superposition of the ground states , which is the asymmetric state @xmath66 ( see fig .

    "we have demonstrated a matched propagation of the fc laser pulse pair that resulted in generation of coherence between the two ground states of the atoms of the extended optically thick medium .",
    "while the pulse pair causes a significant excitation in the atoms close to the boundary of the medium , the excitation of the atoms becomes negligible in the medium at larger propagation length .",
    "excitation of the atoms near the boundary of the medium , however , plays an important role in generation of a macroscopic polarization , which interaction with the fc pulses results in the matched quasi - lossless propagation of the pulses in the optically thick medium .    by analyzing the dressed states of the atoms",
    ", we have demonstrated that the fc pulse pair induces a population transfer mechanism substantially different from the transfer process typical for the matched pulses having constant carrier frequency . the fc pulse pair , in course of its propagation transfers the majority of the atoms of the medium into approximately the same coherent superposition of their ground states . in contrary , the population distribution among the ground states induced by the constant frequency pulse pair may change significantly at different locations in the medium . furthermore , the magnitude of the coherence created by the fc pulses can be controlled by the peak amplitudes of the these laser pulses at the boundary of the medium .    the obtained results , especially those concerning the robust creation of coherence between atomic metastable ( ground ) states in a spatially extended , optically thick medium may find important applications in schemes of frequency conversion through nonlinear optical mixing processes , as well as in other nonlinear processes where the initial preparation of an extended medium in a coherent superposition state is needed .",
