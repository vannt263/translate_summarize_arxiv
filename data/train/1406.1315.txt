    "unperturbed central potential of an atom is positive on all distances and can not bind positron . only when correlations between positron and atomic electrons are taken into account , positron can be bound to a majority of atoms  @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a simple explanation of the positron binding is polarization of the atom by positron field .",
    "electron - positron attraction shifts the electron cloud towards the positron producing electric dipole moment of the atom .",
    "this induced electric dipole moment creates polarization potential which on large distances behaves like @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is static dipole polarizability of the atom .",
    "however , many atoms also have a static quadrupole moment which produces a long - range potential which decays slower ( @xmath6 ) than the polarization potential ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore , it looks interesting to investigate the role of the quadrupole potential in the positron binding",
    ".    there are many different techniques used to calculate positron binding energy to atoms .",
    "the variational and configuration interaction calculations may easily include the quadrupole contribution .",
    "in other calculations based on the correlation potential  @xcite and coupled - cluster single - double  @xcite approaches the quadrupole potential contribution was not included since the positron was assumed to be in @xmath8-wave .",
    "note , that assuming positron being in @xmath8 state does not mean that contribution of higher angular momenta are totally neglected .",
    "for example , in the case of correlation potential method  @xcite binding energy is related to the expectation value of the correlation potential @xmath9 : @xmath10 , where @xmath8 is the positron wave function and higher values of both electron and positron angular momenta are included into the perturbation theory calculation of @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the effect of the virtual positron formation is taken into account ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    in spite of the fact that many calculations do include the quadrupole contribution ,",
    "it was never presented separately .",
    "however , it is useful to know it to judge whether it can be at least partly responsible for the difference in results in different calculations .",
    "it is also important to know whether that contribution can be large enough to provide the difference between binding and not binding . in this paper",
    "we study the quadrupole contribution using simple variational approach .",
    "positron trial wave function in the presence of electric dipole and quadrupole potentials is taken in the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the normalization constant , @xmath13 are spherical harmonics , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are variational parameters , and @xmath16 is a cut - off distance from the nucleus .",
    "it is assumed that the wave function is zero at @xmath17 .",
    "the potential energy of the positron for @xmath18 is @xmath19 where @xmath5 is the polarizability of the atom , @xmath0 is its quadrupole moment , and @xmath20 is legendre polynomial . there is also additional infinite potential barrier at @xmath21 which simulates the effect of positron repulsion from the positive electrostatic potential inside the atom .",
    "the mixing of @xmath8 and @xmath22 waves provides localisation of the positron wave function in equatorial or polar areas depending on the sign of @xmath0 .    using schrdinger equation positron energy",
    "can be written as @xmath23 substituting ( [ eq : psi ] ) into ( [ eq : variation ] ) leads to explicit form of @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a dimensionless variational parameter and @xmath27 is the dimensionless variational energy .",
    "the function @xmath28 can be written in the form @xmath29 where @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    and @xmath33 is the exponential integral @xcite .",
    "variation of the energy ( [ eq : variation ] ) with respect of the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath15 requires that @xmath35 solving these equations for @xmath34 and @xmath15 would lead to the ground state energy @xmath36 of the positron in an atom specified by three parameters , the cut - off parameter @xmath16 , the polarizability @xmath5 , and quadrupole moment @xmath0 .",
    "partial derivative of the energy ( [ eq : energy ] ) with respect to @xmath15 leads to @xmath37 this equation can be used to express @xmath15 in terms of the other parameter @xmath34 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a simple function of @xmath34 : @xmath40 the function @xmath41 is the same as the @xmath34-dependent part of the equation ( [ eq : second ] ) .",
    "it is positive for all @xmath42 and @xmath43 asymptotically at @xmath44 .",
    "we substitute the expression ( [ eq : beta ] ) for @xmath15 into second variational equation @xmath45 . for each root @xmath46 of this equation",
    "there are four different values of @xmath15 found from eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) .    final equation to solve for the extrema of the energy , which depends only on @xmath34 after substituting @xmath47 , has the form    @xmath48    this equation is to be solved numerically for the roots @xmath49 if they exist .",
