    "the study on one - dimensional ( 1d ) magnetic systems began in 1930@xmath1s.@xmath2 although several decades passed , the low - dimensional antiferromagnets have still received much renewed attention owing to both experimental and theoretical efforts in the past few years . on the theoretical aspect , most recent works associated with methods such as finite - size scaling,@xmath3 numerical calculations,@xmath4 monte carlo methods,@xmath5 analyses of an exactly solvable model,@xmath6 etc . ,",
    "have been devoted to verifying haldane@xmath1s conjecture@xmath7 that the uniform integer spin chain with heisenberg antiferromagnetic interactions is massive whereas the half - integer spin chain is massless , and much progress towards understanding haldane@xmath1s scenario has been made so far .    on the other hand , haldane@xmath1s conjecture has been confirmed experimentally in a number of 1d antiferromagnets with spin integer .",
    "quite recently , honda et al@xmath8 reported an anomaly of heat capacity on a single crystal sample of the @xmath0 quasi-1d heisenberg antiferromagnet ( haf ) @xmath9 ( briefly ndmap ) in applied magnetic fields , and identified such an anomaly as an indication of a field - induced magnetic long - range ordering .",
    "they found an anisotropy in the susceptibility which can be explained as due to the single - ion anisotropy of @xmath10 .",
    "the model hamiltonian they adopted is expressed as    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the exchange integral ( for ndmap @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the single - ion anisotropy constant , @xmath15 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath16 is the @xmath17 tensor with elements @xmath18 and @xmath19 corresponding to the @xmath17 values perpendicular and parallel to the chain c axis , respectively .",
    "motivated by this nice experiment , we have recently discussed such an 1d system in a longitudinal magnetic field.@xmath20 as this magnetic system is expected to reveal quite different behaviors in longitudinal and transverse applied fields , as manifested by experiments@xmath8 , it would be interesting to pay attention to the case in a transverse magnetic field .",
    "it is thus the purpose of this present article to report thermodynamic behaviors of this system in the presence of a transverse magnetic field by means of the modified schwinger boson mean - field theory * ( * sbmft*)*. as is well known , the sbmft works well for the 1d haf with integer spins , which can include the effects of quantum fluctuations self - consistently in the large-@xmath21 saddle point , where @xmath21 is the quasiparticle degeneracy .",
    "the schwinger boson approach is actually a large-@xmath21 formulation , and the large-@xmath22 limit of hamiltonian is taken with @xmath23 fixed@xmath24 with the constraint @xmath25 at each site for schwinger bosons . for large values of @xmath26",
    "the system is magnetically ordered in high dimensions , while the quantum disordered state appears at small @xmath26 . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    "one may expect the degeneracy to be lifted and @xmath21 could be smaller than in the absence of a magnetic field . by noting that the degeneracy is for schwinger boson quasiparticles , the sbmft still works even if the applied magnetic field lifts some degeneracies , because even for small @xmath21 it is known that the sbmft can produce fair results for the 1d haf with integer spin ( see , e.g. ref.[12 ] ) .",
    "our so - obtained results would thus be reliable at the mean - field level .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in next section",
    ",  the  thermodynamic quantities such as the specific heat and the transverse susceptibility will be calculated based on the framework of the sbmft .",
    "the detail formalism of sbmft for this present system is collected in the appendix .",
    "finally , a summary and discussion will be presented .",
    "based on the self - consistent equations developed in the appendix , we may obtain the static uniform transverse susceptibility ( along @xmath27 direction ) per site by @xmath28n_{\\alpha } ( k)+[n_{\\beta } ( k)+1]n_{\\beta } ( k)\\ }   \\nonumber   \\label{14b } \\\\ & & \\ + \\frac{(1-u^{2}(k))^{-\\frac{3}{2}}}{2\\lambda ^{\\prime } } ( n_{\\alpha } ( k)+n_{\\beta } ( k)+1)\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where    @xmath29    the specific heat per site , @xmath30 , can be easily obtained by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the internal energy . for convenience in numerical calculations , we shall set @xmath33 as energy scale , @xmath34 ( from ref .",
    "[ 8 ] ) and @xmath35 hereafter .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat ( @xmath36 ) for different fields at @xmath37 is shown as in fig . 1 .",
    "one may see that the specific heat increases with increasing field at low temperature , whereas it decreases with increasing field at high temperature . at a given magnetic field @xmath38",
    ", there is an anomaly clearly observed in the curve of @xmath36 at a temperature @xmath39 .",
    "if the transverse field is taken off , the anomaly disappears .",
    "such an anomaly might be an indicative of field - induced transition .",
    "recall that in the presence of a longitudinal field , the system shows no any anomaly in the curve of @xmath36 observed.@xmath20 in this sense , this kind of field - induced transition appears only when a transverse magnetic field is applied to the system within the framework of the sbmft . by noting that the anomalies were also observed in experiments for different longitudinal fields at almost the same temperature , although with smaller peaks than applying the transverse fields",
    "the fact that our sbmft can not produce this result shows that there might be some limitations for this approach . with increasing the magnetic field",
    ", the temperature @xmath39 where the field - induced transition occurs , moves to low temperature side . combining the results of susceptibility ( see below )",
    ", we may identify the transition as one from a disordered phase to a spin - polarized phase .",
    "we could understand this phenomenon as a consequence of the broken of the @xmath40 symmetry.@xmath41 when the external field is applied along the @xmath42-axis , the @xmath43 symmetry is retained . on the contrary , when the magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the @xmath42-axis , the @xmath43 symmetry is broken and an ising anisotropy is produced ( see , e.g. ref . [ 8 ] and references therein ) . at a given field",
    "an anomaly of specific heat will thus appear at a given temperature due to the @xmath44 symmetry breaking , which is an indicative of a field - induced transition from a disordered phase to a spin - polarized phase as the transverse field tends to align spins perpendicular to the easy axis .",
    "here we would like to point out that the anomaly we observed is different from the usual broad peak of @xmath36 which appears at temperature @xmath45 whatever the magnetic field is present or absent , while @xmath45 decreases with increasing the field . since the limitation of the approximation we can not find such a broad peak of @xmath36 within the frame of sbmft , as discussed in a number of references .",
    "this may be a shortcoming of the sbmft .",
    "however , at high temperature we have observed the specific heat decreases with increasing the field , which shows a correct trend for @xmath0 afm chain . on the other hand",
    ", we note that the anomalies in the curves of @xmath36 were observed experimentally for ndmap at high magnetic fields .",
    "our calculated result is in qualitatively agreement with this experimental obervation@xmath46 if we make a rescale for the field as @xmath47,@xmath48 where @xmath49 is a critical field at which the anomaly of specific heat disappears at zero temperature . in the present case @xmath50 . with this field",
    "rescaling , we find that the temperature where the anamoly occurs increases with the field , consistent with the experimental observation .",
    "we would like to point out that we could not compare the experimental data directly with our calculated results , because the experimental data@xmath46 include the contribution of the lattice which is not given .",
    "however , one may see that the results obtained on the basis of the sbmft in the present fashion might capture qualitatively some experimental features of the @xmath0 haf chain in the presence of a transverse field .",
    "besides , our sbmft result seems also to be in qualitatively agreement with the upper phase boundary of the exact diagonalization of finite chains , although the latter results are extracted from the staggered susceptibility.@xmath41    we have also investigated the effect of the single - ion anisotropy on the specific heat in a given field @xmath51 , as shown in fig .",
    "the result shows that the anisotropy does not have so much effect on the specific heat , and it only causes slight changes in the peaks and dips of @xmath52 it appears that @xmath36 increases , though small , with increasing @xmath14 , as indicated in the inset of fig .",
    "2 . one may notice that this result is very different from the case in the presence of a longitudinal applied field , where the effect of the single - ion anisotropy on specific heat is various.@xmath53 this result is readily understandable , because the single - ion anisotropy is xy - like , and if the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the @xmath42-axis , the single - ion anisotropy would have no much effect on the physical obervables , as illustrated in the present case , while such an anisotropy would matter if the magnetic field is applied along the @xmath42-axis , as manifested in ref.[10 ] .",
    "the external field dependence of the specific heat for different temperatures at @xmath54 is depicted in fig .",
    "it is shown that at a given temperature the specific heat increases with increasing field , and after arriving at a maximum , decreases faster and then slow with increasing field .",
    "one may see again that there are anomalies in the curves of the specific heat versus the external field .",
    "it is interesting to note that the magnetic field at which the specific heat shows a peak at a given temperature is consistent with those found in fig .",
    "1 . for a given temperature",
    ", @xmath55 behaves as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) are temperature - dependent coefficients .",
    "for example , at @xmath59 the fitting results give @xmath60 at @xmath61 is @xmath62 .",
    "it can be seen that after making a field recaling @xmath63 one may find that the position of the anomaly of the specific heat moves to high field side with increasing temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of susceptibility ( @xmath64 ) at @xmath54 in different fields is depicted in fig .",
    "it is observed that the susceptibility shows a broad peak at low temperature in low fields ( in our case @xmath65 ) , which is a characteristic of @xmath0 heisenberg afm chain , and it goes to zero at @xmath66 for the field less than @xmath67 , suggesting that the system is in a haldane gapped phase in this regime . for @xmath68",
    "we found the susceptibility of this 1dspin system goes to a finite value as @xmath69 tends to zero , implying that in this regime the system is in a luttinger liquid ( ll ) phase .",
    "it is clear that there exists a transition from the haldane gapped phase to the ll phase at @xmath70 at which the excited gap closes .",
    "the result agrees with that of the effective - field theory and size scaling analysis@xmath71 with the finite chain calculation@xmath72 , which indicates that the field - induced transition occurs from the disordered ground state to the gapless tomonaga - luttinger liquid phase at some critical external field @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , a phase boundary in field ( @xmath73)-temperature ( @xmath69 ) plane is thus obtained by observing the variation of susceptibility . on the other hand , for @xmath74",
    ", the gap vanishes and we find a range of linear @xmath75 dependence for the specific heat , which is also a characteristic for the ll phase.@xmath76 for the higher field ( @xmath77 ) the susceptibility diverges and persists up to saturation as temperature tends to zero , showing that the system now enters into a spin - polarized phase .",
    "thus , there must be a transition from the ll phase to a spin - polarized phase at @xmath78 .",
    "however , it is not easy to determine @xmath79 according to the divergence of the susceptibility .",
    "fortunately , we observed that there is a curvature change in the curves of @xmath64 versus temperature for different fields , as enlarged in the inset of fig .",
    "4 . although the curvature change in the susceptibility itself is not an indication of a phase transition , by observing that the susceptibility shows different behaviors at low temperatures in different phases , one could identify when the system enters into the spin - polarized phase from the ll phase by observing the curvature change of the susceptibility .",
    "the positions of curvature change are the same as the positions in curves of the specific heat at which the specific heat exhibits an anomaly , which gives the estimation of @xmath79 . in other words , at @xmath79 the specific heat shows anomalies , indicating a transition occurs at @xmath79 .",
    "note that the curvature - changing position moves to low temperature side with increasing field .",
    "it can be observed that the behavior of susceptibility in the transverse field is very different from the results in the longitudinal field,@xmath20 where there is no curvature - changing observed in the curves of @xmath64 versus temperature .",
    "the effect of the single - ion anisotropy on susceptibility is also investigated .",
    "it is found that the single - ion anisotropy does not change so much the shape and the magnitude of susceptibility .",
    "though the effect on susceptibility is not obvious , it can cause a small decreasing of @xmath64 at a given temperature and a given field .",
    "one can obtain a schematic phase diagram in field ( @xmath80)-anisotropy ( @xmath14 ) plane by observing the variation of susceptibility , as shown in fig .",
    "the phase boundary is characterized by closure of the excited gap .",
    "the system is in a gapless phase above the boundary and is in a gapped haldane phase below the boundary .",
    "one may note that the change of @xmath80 with @xmath14 in the diagram is only a few percent .",
    "whatever the anisotropy is strong or weak , the system is always in the haldane phase if @xmath80 is less than @xmath81 .",
    "when @xmath14 is larger , the external field required to drive the system into the gapless phase becomes larger .",
    "for example , at @xmath82 the critical field is @xmath81 , and at @xmath83 it becomes @xmath84 .",
    "it is found that the critical field in the case of the transverse field is larger than that in the longitudinal field .",
    "for instance , at @xmath37 and @xmath66 the critical field in the transverse case is @xmath81 , while it is @xmath85 in the longitudinal case .",
    "our result is in agreement with the estimation on the critical field at @xmath37 on the basis of exact diagonalization of finite chains,@xmath41 and is qualitatively consistent with the experimental extrapolation in ndmap@xmath86 .",
    "6 gives the field - dependence of susceptibility at @xmath54 at different temperatures .",
    "it is observed that for @xmath87 the behavior of @xmath64 versus transverse field at low temperature is quite different from that at high temperature .",
    "the positions of curvature change in @xmath64 are consistent with our observation for the anomalies in specific heat .",
    "we also observed that the single - ion anisotropy does not have much effect on the behavior of the susceptibility versus transverse field .",
    "by summarizing the above results on the specific heat and the susceptibility , we may propose a schematic phase diagram in field ( @xmath88)-temperature ( @xmath69 ) plane within the framework of sbmft . since the anisotropy does not have much effect on the behavior of thermodynamic obervables of the system under interest , without loss of generality we present the phase diagram for @xmath37 as an example , as shown in fig .",
    "7 . when the transverse field is less than @xmath73 , the system should be in a gapped phase ( haldane phase ) . at @xmath89",
    "the gap closes .",
    "the lower boundary for @xmath73 is determined by observing the closure of spin gap in the curves of the susceptibility as a function of the applied transverse field and temperature . for @xmath90",
    ", the system might be in a luttinger liquid phase , characterized by finite values of the susceptibility at @xmath91 .",
    "when @xmath92 , the system goes into a spin - polarized phase . at @xmath78 , the anomalies in the curves of the specific heat as well as the susceptibility appear .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the shape of the ll phase becomes more symmetric for @xmath14 nonzero .",
    "it seems that our proposed phase diagram based on the sbmft is somewhat different from the results of exact diagonalization on finite chains.@xmath41 in the phase diagram presented in ref .",
    "[ 16 ] the lower and upper boundaries of the antiferromagnetic ordered phase are given by @xmath73 and @xmath79 , which are determined by the staggered susceptibility .",
    "while in our proposed phase diagram , @xmath73 and @xmath79 are determined by observing the behaviors of the uniform transverse susceptibility as well as the specific heat .",
    "considering the mean - field feature of our method , we can not determine with accuracy whether a small region of an ordered phase at very low temperatures ( @xmath93 ) in the ll phase exists , as the susceptibility we calculated is not a staggered but uniform one . in this sense ,",
    "our proposed phase diagram is not incompartible with that of ref.[16 ] , which can be viewed as a complement for finite - size calculations .",
    "therefore , it could be better to understand the thermodynamic properties of this 1d spin system in the presence of the applied field based on a combination of our sbmft results and finite - size calculations .",

    "90103023 and 10104015 ) , the state key project for fundamental research in china , and by the chinese academy of sciences .",
    "in this appendix , we shall present the detail derivation of the self - consistent equations based on the sbmft .",
    "these equations are applied to get the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "we suppose that the system in eq.(1 ) with @xmath94 is defined on a bipartite lattice with sublattices a and b. for sublattice a , we denote the spin operator @xmath95 by schwinger bosons @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( see ref .",
