    "connecting small clusters of water and the condensed phases of water through a single molecular model has been a long sought - after but so - far unachieved goal .",
    "the challenges involved in the pursuit of this goal are numerous .",
    "for example , at the cluster level , the born - oppenheimer energies of topologically distinct isomers of the water hexamer differ by less than 1 kcal / mol @xcite , indicating that highly - correlated electronic structure calculations are required to quantitatively determine the energy order of these isomers . in this regard",
    ", a faithful description of molecular flexibility appears to be particularly important.@xcite furthermore , it has also been shown that nuclear quantum - mechanical effects can impact the structural , thermodynamic , and dynamical properties of both clusters and bulk phases of water.@xcite the explicit inclusion of nuclear quantum effects in simulations exacerbates the computational expense of a model , providing additional strain on the ability to obtain statistically meaningful results .",
    "the majority of water simulations rely on force fields , which are built upon the many - body expansion of the interaction energy,@xcite @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the one - body ( 1b ) potential , which describes the energy required to deform an individual molecule from its equilibrium geometry . in common force - fields ,",
    "the 1b interactions include all bonded terms ( i.e. , stretches , bends , and torsions ) . for systems , such as water ,",
    "that are easily reduced to distinct molecules , a 1b configuration is typically referred to as a `` monomer '' , and groups of 2 , 3 , ... , @xmath2 interacting monomers",
    "are then termed `` dimers '' , `` trimers '' , ... , `` @xmath2-mers '' . in eq .",
    "[ eq : many - body ] , higher - order interactions are defined recursively through the lower - order terms . for instance , the two - body ( 2b ) interaction is expressed as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dimer energy .",
    "similarly , the three - body ( 3b ) interaction is @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the trimer energy .",
    "common force fields are pairwise additive , meaning that three - body and higher interactions are neglected .",
    "if it converges quickly , the many - body expansion represents a powerful approach to studying condensed phases as it allows for the energy of an @xmath2-molecule system to be expressed as a sum of lower - order interactions that can in principle be calculated with high accuracy . recently , a detailed study of the convergence of the many - body expansion for water based on the analysis of small clusters was performed using coupled cluster theory with single , double , and perturbative triple excitations [ ccsd(t ) ] and large basis sets.@xcite consistent with previous observations @xcite , it was determined that , although two - body interactions dominate the expansion , the three - body term can contribute up to 30% of the total energy of the water hexamer .",
    "an estimate of the relative magnitudes of the many - body terms in liquid was obtained through an rimp2 analysis of the 21-mer , for which two - body interactions were found to contribute 75 - 80% of the total interaction energy and three - body interactions comprised 15 - 20%.@xcite for both the water hexamer and the 21-mer , higher - order terms contribute less than 5% of the total interaction energy .",
    "it should be noted that , while quickly converging for water , the many - body expansion has been shown to converge slowly and with marked oscillatory behavior for other systems.@xcite    in this study , the accuracy of several force fields , density functional theory ( dft ) , and _",
    "ab initio_potentials in reproducing the two- and three - body water interactions is assessed through a detailed comparison with data obtained at the ccsd(t ) level of theory ( section [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "based on this analysis , a new _ ab initio_water model , hbb2-pol , is then introduced in section [ sec : methods ] . in section [ sec : results ] , we show that hbb2-pol accurately maps the ccsd(t ) results for both the 2b and 3b interactions into an efficient analytical functional form and predicts the second and third virial coefficients in excellent agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "a summary is given in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the many - body expansion provides the underlying basis for common classical force fields . in most cases , including the widely - used tip4p and spc families@xcite , pairwise additivity is assumed , with three- and higher - body interactions being  encoded \" into the effective two - body contributions . in addition , the majority of these models treat the water molecules as rigid monomers ( i.e. , the 1b interactions are set to zero ) , with only few quantum water models , notably as q - tip4p / f and qspc / fw,@xcite allowing for molecular flexibility .",
    "nevertheless , pairwise force fields have been surprisingly successful at reproducing , at least qualitatively , the properties of water in homogeneous environments.@xcite however , such force fields are expected to be inherently limited in their ability to model the microscopic behavior of aqueous interfaces , water confined at the nanoscale , and clusters , whose properties are sensitive to the detailed interplay of 1b , 2b , 3b , and higher - body interactions.@xcite    recent work has focused on improving empirical models through inclusion of three - body interactions , leading to the development of the e3b model.@xcite although the inclusion of explicit 3b interactions greatly improves the accuracy of the e3b model relative to pairwise force fields , the use of rigid water monomers and empirical parameterization necessarily misses some of the fundamental properties of the many - body expansion .",
    "for example , recent e3b simulations of the isomeric equilibria of the water hexamer have led to predictions that are markedly different from _ ab initio_calculations .",
    "specifically , the prism structure , which corresponds to the energetically lowest - lying isomer at the mp2 and ccsd(t ) levels of theory , @xcite is unstable in the e3b calculations.@xcite    since non - pairwise additive intermolecular interactions arise primarily from electronic polarization at long distances , several methods have been proposed to incorporate this effect into the framework of classical force fields.@xcite one common approach is the applequist polarizable point dipole model,@xcite which was elaborated upon by thole to address the so - called polarization catastrophe.@xcite thole - type polarizable force fields for water include ttm3-f@xcite , ttm4-f@xcite , and amoeba@xcite models .    among methods that attempt to solve directly the many - body problem from `` first principles '' , semiempirical models represent an attractive alternative due to their computational efficiency .",
    "semiempirical models such as pm3@xcite and pm3-mais@xcite were derived within the mndo scheme and differ primarily in the form of the core - core repulsion as well as in the precise values of their adjustable parameters .",
    "these models were parametrized either by fitting experimental data for a wide variety of systems ( pm3 ) or _ ab initio_reference data in the case of pm3-mais .",
    "due to the use of a minimal basis and the explicit neglect of correlation , semiempirical methods are particularly limited in their ability to describe non - bonded interactions .",
    "this deficiency has been addressed by the scp - nddo model , which augments traditional semiempirical methods with classical polarization.@xcite scp - nddo has shown success in modeling water clusters and has recently been extended to simulations of bulk properties.@xcite    different dft methods has also been extensively used to the study of condensed phases , primarily through the use of gga functionals such as blyp@xcite and pbe.@xcite however , common density functionals are by construction limited in their ability to describe weakly interacting van der waals complexes .",
    "one attempt to address this problem involves the addition of a dispersion correction to the energy through the @xmath7 term , where the @xmath8 parameters are atom and basis - set specific @xcite .",
    "these `` dft - d '' models have successfully described systems such as the solvation of iodide in water @xcite , but are limited by the need to develop parameters for each functional / basis set.@xcite furthermore , because the correction is pairwise additive , it neglects higher - body dispersion contributions .",
    "recent work to address this limitation has been reported.@xcite    a promising alternative to the pairwise dft - d correction is represented by the non - local van der waals ( nl - vdw ) functionals.@xcite these nl - vdw functionals utilize the electron density to define a non - local correlation contribution to the exchange - correlation functional , leading to a consistent description of both short - range and long - range interactions . since no atomic or basis - set dependent parameters are required to describe the dispersion interaction due to the explicit dependence of the non - local correlation on the electron density , nl - vdw functionals , in principle , require minimal parameterization and are system - independent . in practice",
    ", great care must be taken to avoid double counting of correlation effects in the combination of semi - local and non - local terms .",
    "van der waals density functionals have recently been applied to the study of liquid water@xcite and ice@xcite .    one final class of models is represented by the _ ab initio_-based interaction potentials .",
    "these models are built upon a rigorous treatment of the many - body expansion of interactions and are characterized by having a functional form that is sufficiently flexible to accurately map high - quality _ ab initio_reference data .",
    "examples of such models are dpp2,@xcite cc - pol , @xcite and whbb.@xcite dpp2 and cc - pol are restricted to the rigid , vibrationally averaged monomer geometries , while whbb uses permutationally invariant polynomials to represent the flexible monomer 2b and 3b potential energy surfaces ( pess ) .",
    "ab initio_-based interaction potentials are quite computationally demanding and are most commonly used in calculations for gas phase systems@xcite , although bulk properties have been obtained from classical simulations with cc - pol@xcite and dpp2 @xcite .",
    "very recently , a flexible version of cc - pol has been developed , cc - pol-8s__f _ _ , and the effects of flexibility on the dimer vibrational - rotation - tunneling ( vrt ) spectra have been characterized.@xcite it was found that both cc - pol-8s__f _ _ and hbb2 ( the 2b potential of whbb ) reproduce the experimental vrt spectra `` about equally well''.@xcite       +    here , we assess the ability of the models presented in section [ sec:2 - 1 ] to describe the 2b and 3b water interactions . roughly 1400 2b interactions and 500 3b interactions were evaluated at the ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz level@xcite and corrected for the basis set superposition error ( bsse ) using the counterpoise method.@xcite these ( flexible ) molecular configurations were extracted from 1 ) classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of hexamers at t @xmath9 30  k using the whbb potential , 2 ) classical md simulations of ice i@xmath10 carried out with ttm3-f at 50  k , and 3 ) classical md simulations of bulk water at 298  k and experimental density using ttm3-f . hereafter , these configurations are referred to as `` low - energy '' configurations . for the analysis of e3b , the ccsd(t ) reference interaction energies",
    "were recomputed for `` rigidified '' molecules corresponding to the flexible configurations that were used in the comparison of the other models .",
    "all dft energies were computed using the aug - def2-tzvpp basis@xcite with the exception of blyp - d , for which the tzvpp basis was used as in the original parametrization of the model.@xcite mp2 energies were computed with the aug - cc - pvtz basis , and both dft and mp2 interactions were corrected for bsse .",
    "ab initio_calculations were performed using the freely - available _ ab initio_package orca@xcite .",
    "pm3 and pm3-mais energies were calculated using the amber / sqm semi - empirical package@xcite , while the scp - nddo energies were obtained using cp2k.@xcite a linear regression analysis for the data presented in figures [ fig : e2b ] and [ fig : e3b ] , as well as root mean square error with respect to ccsd(t ) data , are presented in the supporting material .",
    "+    figures [ fig : e2b ] and [ fig : e3b ] show correlation plots for the 2b and 3b interactions calculated for all models described in section [ sec:2 - 1 ] relative to the ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz energies . while most empirical pairwise force fields implicitly include nuclear quantum effects , models such as q - tip4p / f and q - spc / fw were specifically parameterized for quantum simulations and , therefore , presumably provide an approximation to the actual born - oppenheimer pes.@xcite as can be seen from figure [ fig : e2b ] , q - tip4p / f deviates substantially from the ccsd(t ) 2b potential energy surface to compensate for the neglect of higher - order interactions ( figure [ fig : e3b ] ) .",
    "force fields that account for higher - order terms generally provide a more accurate description of the 2b interactions than effective pairwise models . in this context , while e3b and ttm3-f / ttm4-f / amoeba treat higher - order interactions using different schemes , all four models give 2b interactions that are in closer agreement with the ccsd(t ) results than the effective pairwise models .",
    "it is interesting to note that e3b , which does not not explicitly include induction and was not parameterized using _",
    "ab initio_data , describes the 3b contributions energies reasonably well .",
    "the three polarizable models considered in this study ( ttm3-f , ttm4-f , and amoeba ) differ in the way they describe the variation of the molecular charge distribution . as an isolated monomer deforms ,",
    "the molecular dipole moment varies in a `` nonlinear '' fashion with respect to the intramolecular coordinates , resulting in a `` nonlinear dipole moment surface '' ( dms).@xcite in ttm4-f , the first - order changes of the dms are fit to electric multipoles and polarizabilites calculated at the mp2 level .",
    "the intramolecular dependence of the atomic charges in ttm3-f was instead motivated by the observation that , while the gas phase monomer charges decrease during the homolytic dissociation , a water molecule in the condensed phase dissociates into charged ions .",
    "this argument was used to justify an empirical correction to _",
    "ab initio_-derived values , giving rise to effective charges that increase as the monomer geometry departs from equilibrium .",
    "by contrast , although amoeba takes into account intramolecular flexibility , the monomer charges are geometry independent.@xcite interestingly , while the accurate monomer dms has been reported to be essential to reproducing the solvated monomer geometry,@xcite the three - body interaction of amoeba is only slightly less accurate than ttm4-f , with rms errors of 0.22 and 0.09 kcal / mol respectively .",
    "it is also important to mention that , unlike in ttm3-f , in both amoeba and ttm4-f the molecular polarzability is anisotropic .",
    "it is unclear whether the inaccuracy observed in the ttm3-f 3b energies arises from its use of effective charges , isotropic molecular polarizability or both .    among the semiempirical methods ,",
    "pm3 was fitted to a wide range of experimental and _ ab initio_data , while pm3-mais and scp - nddo were both fitted to _ ab initio_reference data of water clusters .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the 2b interactions of pm3-mais and scp - nddo are in better agreement with the ccsd(t ) data than pm3 .",
    "it is interesting , however , that scp - nddo shows much tighter correlation to the _ ab initio_data than pm3-mais , even though the latter uses almost twice as many adjustable parameters as scp - nddo .",
    "while the two mndo - type semiempirical methods display significant deficiencies in describing the 3b interactions , scp - nddo reproduces the ccsd(t ) data quite accurately .",
    "these results suggest that the addition of classical polarization , as implemented in scp - nddo , can allow semiempirical methods to accurately describe intermolecular interactions without requiring extensive reparametrizations of the core - core terms .    at the 2b level ,",
    "the gga density functionals differ appreciably from the ccsd(t ) results ( see supporting information for pbe and pbe0 results ) , with blyp systematically underestimating the interaction strength .",
    "the inclusion of the dispersion correction in blyp - d improves the agreement with the ccsd(t ) values for the 2b interactions .",
    "however , although dft is less sensitive to basis set incompleteness than wavefunction methods , the absence of diffuse functions in the blyp - d basis results in a large bsse correction ( see figure [ fig : e2b ] , where blue circles give the bsse - corrected interaction and gray circles the bsse - uncorrected interaction ) .",
    "indeed , bsse is so small for blyp , b3lyp , rpw86pbe , and vv10 that it is barely visible in figures  [ fig : e2b ] and  [ fig : e3b ] .",
    "while blyp - d can accurately describe the 2b interactions when a sufficiently large basis set is used or the energy values are corrected for bsse , how to balance these factors in condensed phase simulations is not straightforward and is the subject of ongoing research.@xcite    while the use of hybrid functionals , such as b3lyp @xcite , results in a much tighter correlation to the ccsd(t ) data than gga functionals , b3lyp nonetheless inherently suffers from inadequate treatment of dispersion interactions , which leads to an incorrect long - range behavior.@xcite among recent nl - vdw functionals , vv10 appears to over - correct its parent functional , rpw86pbe , leading to over bound 2b interactions .",
    "all dft methods perform reasonably well for the 3b interactions .",
    "it is important to note that , because the dispersion correction is pair additive , blyp and blyp - d provide identical 3b interactions . by contrast ,",
    "nl - vdw functionals include a three - body dispersion correction , although this is almost negligible for vv10 ( see supporting information ) .",
    "mp2 agrees well with ccsd(t ) , with an rms of 0.03 and 0.02 kcal / mol for the 2b and 3b interactions , respectively .",
    "consistent with previous observations , the magnitude of bsse is much smaller for 3b than 2b interactions.@xcite    with the exception of mp2 , whbb provides the lowest rms for the 2b interactions .",
    "whbb employs a permutationally invariant polynomial with 5227 coefficients that were fit to reproduce @xmath1130000 ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz 2b interactions . to account for basis - set truncation",
    ", the reference 2b interactions were chosen as weighted averages of bsse - corrected and bsse - uncorrected ccsd(t ) interactions.@xcite .",
    "since both whbb and cc - pol reproduce the vrt spectrum of the water dimer with comparable accuracy,@xcite a similar agreement with the ccsd(t ) data at the 2b level is also expected for cc - pol .",
    "the agreement of whbb with the ccsd(t ) values for the 3b interactions is less satisfactory , with whbb increasingly underestimating the energies of the lowest - lying trimers .",
    "results for the hbb2-pol model will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "due to its rapid convergence for water , the many - body expansion of interaction energies provides a viable way to  scale up \" the ccsd(t ) level of accuracy to a large number of molecules .",
    "furthermore , by accurately fitting the 1b , 2b , and 3b interactions into a relatively inexpensive function , simulations of condensed phases at an effective ccsd(t ) level of accuracy become feasible . for flexible monomers , the most sophisticated effort along these lines ,",
    "whbb,@xcite has indisputably proven this concept . however , whbb is not directly applicable to bulk phase simulations due to its prohibitively expensive 3b term .",
    "motivated by this observation , this section reports the development of a new model , hbb2-pol model , beginning with a discussion of the 3b interaction .",
    "our development exploits the fact that the 3b interaction in water arises primarily from induction , with all other contributions vanishing quickly as the intermolecular separation increases.@xcite this naturally leads to the following ansatz : @xmath12 that represents the 3b interaction as the sum of an induction term , @xmath13 , and a short - range  correction \" , @xmath14 .",
    "the physical origins of @xmath14 are related to the breakdown of the assumptions made in the derivation the thole - type induction term as well as to the quantum - mechanical contributions associated with 3b exchange - repulsion and charge transfer.@xcite the induction scheme of ttm4-f is used in @xmath15due to its superior accuracy with respect to other polarizable models ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : e3b ] ) .",
    "the short - ranged nature of the  correction \" is enforced explicitly by the switching function , @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 * * + @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 denotes the position of the @xmath22-th molecule oxygen atom .",
    "this form was found to be better capable of including all trimers in the first solvation shell of a central water molecule ( in particular , the `` linear '' trimers ) than those based on maximum oxygen - oxygen separations .",
    "importantly , while the switch in equation ( [ eq : switch-3b ] ) goes from 3 to 0 as the trimer passes from the short - range to the long range , the product @xmath23 is fitted , rather than @xmath14 by itself .",
    "this ensures that no artifact is introduced due to the switching .",
    "however , because @xmath23 is fitted in the context of @xmath13 , this also implies that , unlike in the case of the whbb 3b polynomial , @xmath14 of hbb2-pol has no meaning by itself but only as the sum @xmath24 .",
    "the ability of the short - range polynomial , @xmath14 , to accurately fit reference data depends largely on its degree , which also determines the associated numerical cost .",
    "consequently , the large 5th and 6th degree 3b polynomials in @xmath14 of whbb constitute the most computationally taxing part of the model .",
    "the different representation of the 3b interactions ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : hbb2-pol-3b ] ) ) , along with the improved description of the induction energies in hbb2-pol allows for an accurate fit of the ccsd(t ) reference data with a lower - degree polynomial . specifically , in hbb2-pol the @xmath14 part is a sum of second and third degree symmetrized products of exponentials of the intermolecular separations @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an adjustable parameter .",
    "neither intramolecular distances nor the two - body terms  those which do not depend on the positions of all three molecules simultaneously  were included into the @xmath14 in hbb2-pol .",
    "labeling the three molecules as a , b , and c , there are 27 distances that contribute :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 stands for the distance between atoms x and y ( see also eq.([eq : variables ] ) ) .",
    "the monomials were constructed by symmetrizing the products of the @xmath29 variables with respect to the permutations of both the molecules and the hydrogen atoms within each molecule ( 48 elements in the permutation group total ) .",
    "a total of 131 different monomials were identified ( 13 are of second degree , and the remaining 118 are of third degree ) : @xmath30 the @xmath14 itself was then taken as a linear combination of @xmath31 : @xmath32 with the coefficients @xmath33 obtained using the least squares fit@xcite to the ccsd(t ) data .",
    "the gradient of @xmath14 with respect to the atomic positions was computed using maple.@xcite      after translational and rotational invariance , the 3b interaction potential for flexible water molecules is 21 dimensional .",
    "since this high - dimensional pes can not be readily trained on a grid , a training set representative of the `` important regions '' of the 3b pes was generated by including :",
    "1 ) repulsive configurations with positive binding energies that are compressed relative to the trimer global minimum , 2 ) `` low - energy '' configurations with thermally accessible binding energies , and 3 ) long - range trimer configurations that have weak 3b interactions .",

    ", 996 trimers were selected from md simulations of clusters ( trimers and hexamers ) at 30  k on the whbb potential energy surface , 3311 trimers were extracted from classical md simulations of hexagonal ice and liquid water carried out with ttm3-f at 50  k and 300  k respectively , 792 trimers were obtained by randomly orienting water monomers in geometries near the global minimum , and 416 trimers were obtained from scans of low - energy structures .",
    "the long - range portion of the training set consists of 432 weakly interacting trimers , with an average o - o distance of at least 5.5   between monomers . after verifying that the ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz 3b interaction energy for these long - range configurations was in agreement with the 3b induction energy from ttm4-f ( within the error associated with basis - set truncation )",

    "many of these compressed configurations , however , correspond to trimers that would practically never be sampled in simulations of water under ambient conditions . while including these configurations in the training set was required to ensure the numerical stability of the model , it was also necessary to guarantee that these highly - repulsive configurations did not degrade the quality of the fit in the region near the minimum .",
    "this consideration is discussed in the following section .      in order to assess the accuracy of any model with respect to _ ab initio_data",
    ", it would be ideal to parameterize the model based on one set of reference data ( the `` training '' set ) and validate the model using a separate set of data ( the `` testing '' set ) .",
    "however , due to the large computational cost associated with bsse - corrected ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz 3b interactions and the fact that the model should be parametrized to as large of a reference set as possible , having two distinct sets is unfeasible . in order to estimate the bias associated with training and testing on the same reference data ,",
    "the complete training set was equally divided into two parts , a training set and a testing set .",
    "care was taken to preserve the relative compositions of each set , e.g. , half of the 972 configurations extracted from simulations of ice were randomly selected and placed in the training set while the other half was placed in the testing set .",
    "since the goal of hbb2-pol is to describe water from small molecular clusters in the gas phase to condensed phases , we found it important to decompose the rms into categories : 1 ) trimers with a binding energy of less than 5  kcal / mol , which are particularly important for low - temperature cluster isomer relative stabilities , 2 ) trimers with a binding energy of less than 30  kcal / mol , which are sampled during path - integral molecular dynamics ( pimd ) simulations of bulk water at ambient conditions , and 3 ) the complete training set , regardless of binding energy ( see table [ tab : testtrain ] ) . due to the proximity of the energies for different isomers of the small clusters ,",
    "it is desirable that 3b interactions corresponding to clusters with the lowest binding energies have the lowest rms . as was discussed in section [ sec : methods-2 ] , it was necessary to include 3b energies corresponding to trimers with positive binding energies to ensure the stability of hbb2-pol .",

    "[ fig : virial2]a ) , the _ ab initio_-based potential energy surfaces whbb and hbb2-pol very closely reproduce the experimental data .",
    "since hbb2-pol and whbb share the same two - body pes at dimer separations of less than 5.5 , it is not surprising that both models predict similar values for the second virial coefficient .",

    "while both qtip4p / f and e3b were empirically parametrized , the inclusion of explicit 3b interactions in e3b allows for a more accurate 2b interaction .",
    "pairwise - additive models , such as qtip4p / f , on the other hand , rely on the 2b interaction to ( partially ) recover 3b effects and would therefore be expected to have a much larger error for the second virial coefficient . when the monomer geometry is changed from the equilibrium to the vibrationally - averaged geometry",

    "in this study , the accuracy of several force fields , semiempirical methods , dft , and _ ab initio_-based models in reproducing the two- and three - body water interactions was assessed against bsse - corrected ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz data .",
