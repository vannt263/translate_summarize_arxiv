    "geometric frustration of interacting spin systems is the driving force of a variety of fascinating phenomena in low - dimensional magnetism @xcite . in this context",
    "the term _ frustration _ describes a situation where in the ground state of a classical spin system not all interactions can be saturated simultaneously . a typical picture for such a situation is a triangle of antiferromagnetically coupled spins , where classically the spins are not in the typical up - down - up configuration , but assume a ground state that is characterized by a relative angle of @xmath4 between neighboring spins .",
    "this special classical ground state characterizes among others several frustrated spin systems which are built of corner - sharing triangles , among them the giant keplerate molecule \\{@xmath0 }  which is a perfect icosidodecahedron @xcite and the kagome lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "the pyrochlore lattice , which consists of corner - sharing tetrahedra and thus has a different structure , nevertheless shares several important properties with the above systems .",
    "research in this field is naturally focused on the low - energy , i.e.  low - temperature , low - field behavior .",
    "a key observation is that the quantum spin systems possess many or even infinitely many singlet states below the first triplet state and the classical counterpart systems display a non - trivial ground state degeneracy @xcite .",
    "another important observation concerns a plateau in the magnetization curve for @xmath5 , which for the systems made of corner - sharing triangles is at @xmath6 , see e.g. @xcite , whereas for the pyrochlore it is at @xmath7 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in this article we focus on special properties of these systems which arise at low temperatures but high magnetic fields",
    ". we will show that it is possible to construct exact many body states which are product states of independent one - magnon states .",
    "these states become ground states in high magnetic fields . in a wider perspective such an arrangement of independent single - particle objects can be understood as condensation of bosons @xcite .",
    "the linear scaling of the minimal total energy with the number of these objects explains their unusual high - field behavior which is expressed in magnetization jumps @xcite , non - zero @xmath3-entropy @xcite , and an enhanced magnetocaloric effect @xcite .",
    "in the following we assume that the spin systems under consideration are modeled by an isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian augmented with a zeeman term , i.e. , @xmath8 @xmath9 are the individual spin operators at sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the @xmath12-component of the total spin .",
    "@xmath13 are the matrix elements of the symmetric coupling matrix .",
    "we will consider only antiferromagnetic couplings .",

    "one of the early unexpected results was that for the icosidodecahedron ( e.g. \\{@xmath0 } ) the minimal energies @xmath16 in each hilbert subspace of @xmath17 of total magnetic quantum number @xmath18 scale linearly with @xmath18 close to the saturation @xcite .",
    "figure [ f-1-a ] shows as another example the minimal energy levels of a special kagome chain ( introduced in @xcite ) where the seven highest levels are on a straight line . in an applied magnetic field",
    "this leads to a simultaneous crossing of the lowest zeeman levels at the saturation field , which gives rise to an unusual magnetization jump , that for the kagome chain is shown in fig .",

    "@xmath19 independent localized magnons can be placed on the kagome lattice . ]",
    "it turns out that the linear dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath18 can be understood in terms of localized independent magnons .",
    "figure [ f-2-a ] shows the structure of a localized magnon on a part of a model lattice as realized for instance in the kagome chain of fig .",
    "[ f-1-a ] .",
    "the one - magnon state is given by @xmath20 it can be shown that this state is an eigenstate of lowest energy in one - magnon space @xmath21 . on an extended lattice such as the kagome chain , fig .",
    "[ f-1-a ] , or the two - dimensional kagome lattice , fig .",
    "[ f-2-b ] , many of these objects can be placed in such a way that they do not interact @xcite .",
    "also in this case it can be shown that these states are eigenstates of lowest energy in their respective @xmath1-magnon space .",
    "an immediate consequence of the independence of the localized one - magnon states and thus of the linear dependence of the minimal energies @xmath16 on @xmath18 is the magnetization jump at the saturation field @xmath22 as well as the high degeneracy of levels at this field value . in an infinite lattice such as the kagome or pyrochlore lattice both quantities are macroscopic @xcite , although it turns out that it is rather involved to evaluate the exact degeneracy at the saturation field due to possible relations between the @xmath1-magnon product states @xcite .",
    "the ground - state degeneracy at @xmath22 is related to a finite @xmath3 entropy per site , i.e.  @xmath23 ( for the kagome chain one obtains @xmath24 @xcite ) . in the context of magnetocalorics",
    "such a residual entropy gives rise to large adiabatic cooling rates @xmath25 in the vicinity of the saturation field @xcite . in a real compound ,",
    "e.g. \\{@xmath0 } , the perfect degeneracy at @xmath22 would be lifted by residual , e.g. dipolar or dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions .",
    "consequently , the magnetization jump would be smeared out , compare ref .",
    "@xcite for \\{@xmath0}. nevertheless , the low - lying density of states remains large at @xmath22 , which would still be clearly visible in magnetocaloric investigations .",
    "it is clear that the energetically degenerate independent localized one - magnon states on translationally symmetric lattices can be superimposed to form eigenstates of the translation operator with the same energy which leads to a flat band .",
    "figure [ f-3-a ] shows the three energy bands of the kagome chain introduced in fig .",
    "[ f-1-a ] .",
    "we observe that one third of all one - magnon states form independent magnons or equally well belong to the flat band .",
    "therefore a jump of one third of the saturation magnetization occurs at @xmath22 for @xmath26 , see fig .",
    "[ f-1-b ] .",
    "the emergence of flat bands has been already noted in the context of _ line graphs _ and _ flat - band ferromagnetism _ , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a connection can be made by replacing the heisenberg model by a hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the roles of the magnetic exchange @xmath27 and the applied magnetic field are then played by the hopping integral @xmath28 the chemical potential @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "if the flat band is the lowest band , then non - interacting localized excitations can be constructed for such fermionic systems in a manner very similar to the heisenberg model , and these fermionic systems exhibit similar thermodynamic properties , but now as function of temperature and chemical potential .",
    "an example is given by fig .",
    "[ f-3-b ] where the isentropes for free spinless fermions @xcite on the kagome chain ( fig .",
    "[ f-1-a ] ) are displayed . at @xmath30",
    "the ground state is degenerate with an extensive @xmath3 entropy @xmath31 .",
    "the value @xmath32 corresponds to the saturation field @xmath22 of the heisenberg model , and a very similar behavior would be observed in its vicinity , e.g. the slopes of the isentropes correspond to the adiabatic cooling rates @xcite .",
    "however , at lower values of @xmath29 ( @xmath33 ) there are qualitative differences : free spinless fermions ( whose dispersion is essentially given in fig .  [ f-3-a ] ) have no band gaps , while the magnetization curve of the @xmath26 heisenberg model presumably has plateaus ( corresponding to gaps ) at least at one third and two thirds of the saturation magnetization ( see fig .  [ f-1-b ] ) .",
    "it may be remarked here that flat - bands on partial line graphs do not need to be ground - state bands @xcite .",
