    "however , due to the substantial decrease of the charge chemical potential @xmath16 with density in the presence of hyperons , the onset condition for the @xmath4-wave @xmath6 condensation , @xmath365 , is met at a much larger density ( filled circles ) than that in the conventional neutron - star matter which consists of only the nucleons @xmath106 , @xmath7 and @xmath259 .",

    "( a ) is for case i , and ( b ) is for case ii . for the strong @xmath4-wave scalar attraction such that @xmath369 340 mev ( @xmath370 ) , there are level crossings between the @xmath6 and the particle - hole branches . as a result , the critical density @xmath366 is sensitive to the magnitude of @xmath371 .",
    "@xmath366 is slightly smaller than @xmath368 in both cases i and ii , but the difference is small , as shown by the dotted lines and dashed lines . for the weaker @xmath4-wave attraction such that @xmath372 340 mev ( @xmath373 ) , the critical density of the @xmath7-wave condensation @xmath366 depends little on the magnitude of @xmath65 ( the solid lines ) .",
    "this is because the @xmath98 , @xmath100 . and",
    "@xmath90 branches hardly depend on the magnitude of @xmath65 as long as no level crossing with the @xmath6 branch occurs before the onset of instability .",
    "the critical density @xmath366 changes little over the range from @xmath74=0 ( @xmath272 ) to @xmath374 340 mev ( @xmath375 ) in both cases i and ii . on the other hand ,",
    "the critical density for the @xmath4-wave @xmath6 condensation @xmath368 becomes large as @xmath74 ( or @xmath371 ) becomes small , due to the reduced contribution from the @xmath4-wave scalar attraction to the @xmath6 excitation energy @xmath376 . in conclusion ,",
    "the critical density of the @xmath7-wave condensation is always smaller than that of the @xmath4-wave @xmath6 condensation as long as @xmath371 is not too large , and the difference between these critical densities gets remarkable with the decrease in the magnitude of the @xmath4-wave scalar attraction .",
    "we address qualitative features of the @xmath7-wave kaon condensation discussed in this paper .",
    "the details will be given elsewhere@xcite .",
    "at a critical density @xmath17 , pairs of the kaonic modes , [ @xmath98]-[@xmath100 ] in case i or [ @xmath98]-[@xmath99 ] in case ii , are spontaneously created via the reaction , @xmath378 in case i or @xmath379 in case ii .",
    "thus , formation of a condensate in hyperonic matter proceeds essentially through the strong reactions , which should be compared with the @xmath4-wave @xmath6 condensation : in the latter case , a condensate is formed through the weak reactions such as @xmath380 , @xmath381 . in the @xmath7-wave condensed phase , baryonic system consists of the fermi seas of the quasiparticles @xmath382 , @xmath383 , @xmath384 , @xmath385 , @xmath386 ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : energy ] ) .",
    "the absolute value of total negative strangeness of the system increases as the baryon number density increases by virtue of the weak reactions .",
    "the relevant strangeness - changing weak processes are given by @xmath387 , @xmath388 ( for @xmath389=@xmath382 , @xmath383 , @xmath384 , @xmath385 , @xmath386 ) , where the classical kaon field @xmath390 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : classical ] ) supplies the system with the energy and momentum to satisfy the kinematical condition for these reactions .",
    "these weak processes may also be relevant to enhanced cooling of neutron stars via neutrino emissions just like a case of pion condensed phase@xcite .",
    "the eos of the @xmath7-wave kaon - condensed phase would be further softened as compared with that of noncondensed hyperonic matter owing to the @xmath7-wave kaon - baryon attractive interaction in addition to the @xmath4-wave one .",
    "the significant softening will make phase transition of a first order after maxwell s construction , leading to a drastic change of the internal structure of neutron stars .",
    "in particular , the first - order phase transition may imply a mixed phase where droplets of a kaon condensate are immersed in the normal phase@xcite .",
    "the first - order phase transition has also important effects on the dynamical evolution of newly - born neutron stars accompanying a delayed collapse , which has already been discussed by several authors in case of the @xmath4-wave kaon condensation@xcite .",
    "we have discussed in - medium properties of kaonic modes in hyperonic matter by taking into account the @xmath7-wave kaon - baryon interaction as well as the @xmath4-wave one on the basis of chiral symmetry .",
    "nonrelativistic effective baryon - baryon interactions , which are parametrized by the use of the recent hypernuclear experimental data , have been used .",
    "it has been shown that a collective @xmath98 mode with the @xmath5 quantum number appears over the densities where the @xmath0 is more abundant than the proton .",
    "the system becomes unstable with respect to a creation of [ @xmath91 ] and [ @xmath98 ] pair or [ @xmath99 ] and [ @xmath98 ] pair ( @xmath7-wave kaon condensation ) , which stems from the @xmath7-wave kaon - baryon interaction . the onset density of this instability is lower than that of the @xmath4-wave @xmath6 condensation for a standard value of the parameter @xmath65 simulating the magnitude of the @xmath4-wave kaon - baryon scalar interaction , and it hardly depends on the value of @xmath65 as long as @xmath371 is not too large .",
    "the possibility of the @xmath7-wave kaon condensation depends on composition of baryons in hyperonic matter .",
    "in particular , large mixing of @xmath391 as compared with that of the proton is needed for the appearance of the @xmath98 mode .",
    "the details about the onset densities of hyperons and their fractions at high densities differ between specific models for the baryonic potentials .",
    "one of the important ingredients which control matter composition is three - body forces for baryons@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that phenomenological inclusion of three - body forces for only nucleons makes hyperon - mixing favorable@xcite .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that inclusion of three - body forces for hyperons on the same footing as the nucleons may considerably change the results on the matter composition and the resultant eos of the hyperonic matter@xcite .",
    "thus one has to be careful for the parametrization of the effective baryon - baryon interactions used in this paper , keeping consistency with these other model calculations .",
    "our model used for the @xmath7-wave kaon - baryon interaction is based on the leading order expansion in the chiral perturbation theory .",
    "higher order terms in chiral expansion which are relevant to the @xmath7-wave meson - baryon scatterings have been estimated with reference to the experimental results such as pion and photon - induced reactions@xcite or elastic and inelastic @xmath88 scatterings@xcite .",
    "it needs more consideration whether these higher order terms are quantitatively important to kaon dynamics in highly dense matter .",
    "it has to be elucidated whether the instability of the system with respect to the @xmath7-wave condensation leads to a fully condensed phase beyond the critical density . in this context",
    ", the eos of the @xmath7-wave condensed phase and the characteristic features of the system have to be examined@xcite .",
    "mixing of hyperons only already leads to appreciable softening of the eos@xcite .",
    "hence , further development of kaon condensates in hyperonic matter would make the eos too soft to obtain the observed neutron star masses @xmath392@xcite or even much larger masses@xmath393 if the recent analyses from the observations of the quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo)@xcite are confirmed@xcite .",
    "relativistic effects may help weaken the softness of the eos , since it has been shown that the energy gain of kaon condensation coming from the @xmath4-wave scalar attraction is suppressed by relativistic effects@xcite : as a kaon condensate develops , the effective nucleon mass @xmath394 decreases due to the scalar attraction , which leads to suppression of the scalar density , @xmath395 .",
    "thus the energy gain of the condensed phase from the scalar attraction ( @xmath396 with the @xmath9 sigma term @xmath10 ) and the growth of a condensate are suppressed .",
    "in addition , in view of making the eos consistent with observations , some realistic effects which reduce the @xmath7-wave kaon - baryon attraction should be taken into account : ( 1 ) vertex renormalization at the @xmath7-wave kaon - baryon vertices in terms of form factors .",
    "( 2 ) short - range correlations between baryons . for the @xmath7-wave part , the off - diagonal matrix elements in the baryonic part of the effective hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ eq : bhm ] ) ]",
    "are to be added by the particle - hole densities , the strengths of which are related with the landau - migdal parameters in the relevant channel in the same way as pion condensation@xcite .",
