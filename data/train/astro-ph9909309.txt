    "a number of early attempts to measure cluster distances could be described as _",
    "ugly _ by current standards . in particular , many early studies suffered from poorly determined systematic errors .",
    "a few early studies were wrong due to erroneous data , i.e. _ bad_. as the field has developed a considerably better understanding of the practical problems associated with cluster distance measurement have emerged and hopefully reliable ( _ good _ ) distances are now starting to appear . the new surveys are starting to provide a sizable set of clusters that possess both good tully - fisher ( tf ) and fundamental plane ( fp ) data .    here",
    "we address three aspects of cluster distances :    * at what level do environmentally dependent stellar population biases affect the fp cluster distance determinations ? *",
    "do the derived fp distances vary systematically with fp scatter ? * how well do the different cluster distance indicators compare ?    we use the smac fp dataset to investigate these themes . for this dataset",
    "the random and systematic errors in the velocity dispersion ( @xmath0 ) measurements are 0.025 dex and 0.015 dex respectively .",
    "for the @xmath1 indices these errors are 0.010 mag and 0.002 mag respectively .",
    "hence this dataset is the highest precision and largest fp dataset that is currently available .",
    "the systematic variation in the stellar populations of elliptical and s0 galaxies with the environment has long been suggested , e.g. larson , tinsley & caldwell ( 1980 ) .",
    "while such an effect on the fp distance indicator is probably only at the level of @xmath20.02 dex between the dense cluster cores and isolated field regions ( lucey 1995 ) , this may produce a bias in the derived distances for poor and rich clusters .",
    "we have examined the cluster - to - cluster offsets in the @xmath3 relation .",
    "following colless et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , in figure 1 we show the median @xmath4 and uncertainty for each cluster .",
    "the smac clusters display a remarkable degree of homogeneity with a measured scatter in @xmath4 of only 0.006 mag .",
    "if the cluster @xmath3 relation is universal then there is a probability of 0.045 that the measured @xmath5 would be observed . in order to derive a reduced @xmath5 of unity an intrinsic rms scatter of 0.004 mag",
    "must be added . as the expected @xmath4 variation due to",
    "the known level of systematic errors is @xmath20.003 mag , there is no evidence for any significant cluster - to - cluster variation in the @xmath3 relations .",
    "the true intrinsic @xmath4 scatter is less than 0.004 mag .",
    "this limit is 4@xmath6 smaller than that found for the efar sample ( colless et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "stellar population models imply that if @xmath1 differences are caused by age differences then a 0.004 mag change in @xmath4 translates into a luminosity change that would give an apparent distance shift of 0.02 dex ( see e.g. jorgensen et al .",
    "this is equivalent to a 340 kms@xmath7 shift at the coma cluster distance .",
    "if stellar population differences were responsible for some component of the fp peculiar velocities we would predict these to be correlated with @xmath4 .",
    "following burstein , faber & dressler ( 1990 ) , we use the quantity @xmath8(v@xmath9/r@xmath10 as a measure of the cluster peculiar velocity .",
    "v@xmath9 is the cluster velocity in the local cmb rest frame and r@xmath11 is the derived cluster distance . in figure 2 , we present the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath8(v@xmath9/r@xmath10 . if the galaxy luminosities are affected by age differences then a slope of 5 is expected .",
    "unfortunately the relatively large errors do not allow a meaningful constraint to be placed on this correlation ; the best fit slope allowing for the errors in both co - ordinates is 18@xmath1290 . for clusters with",
    "@xmath4@xmath13 0.0 the mean @xmath8(v@xmath9/r@xmath10 value is 0.011@xmath120.008 whereas for clusters with @xmath4@xmath14 0.0 the value is 0.004@xmath120.008 .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence that age differences bias the fp distances for the smac sample .",
    "if such a stellar population bias existed , in order to cause a spurious bulk flow signal the @xmath15 residuals would need to be correlated on the sky .",
    "for the smac sample this is not the case and the bulk flow measurement is only weakly affected .",
    "if a @xmath4 term is included in the distance indicator the smac bulk flow measurement _ increases _ by @xmath270 kms@xmath7 .",
    "using mostly literature fp data for 20 rich clusters , gibbons , fruchter and bothun ( 1998 ) have recently suggested that clusters which have a lower fp rms scatter also possess a lower peculiar velocity and vice versa . in the left hand panel of figure 3",
    "we reproduce their plot of fp scatter versus peculiar velocity .",
    "they propose two sub - groups with the division at an fp rms scatter of @xmath20.07 in units of @xmath16 .",
    "for this sample , the lower fp scatter clusters have an average absolute peculiar velocity of 220@xmath1250 kms@xmath7 ( n=11 ) whereas the higher fp scatter clusters have a value of 830@xmath12200 kms@xmath7 ( n=9 ) .",
    "they suggest that the measured peculiar velocities for the higher fp scatter group of clusters are not real but due to a systematic difference in the fp relation .",
    "the equivalent plot for the smac clusters is shown in the right hand panel of figure 3 .",
    "for the 39 clusters which have an rms fp scatter less than 0.07 , the average absolute peculiar velocity is 610@xmath1290 kms@xmath7 .",
    "for the 17 clusters with an fp rms scatter greater than 0.07 , the average value is 760@xmath12120 kms@xmath7 . if we consider only the well sampled clusters ( @xmath1710 ) , which are less affected by outliers , the lower and higher fp scatter groups have an average absolute peculiar velocity of 560@xmath12110 kms@xmath7 ( n=16 ) and 690@xmath12150 kms@xmath7 ( n=9 ) respectively .",
    "thus for the smac sample there is no evidence for a trend of peculiar velocity with fp scatter .",
    "direct comparison of the cluster distances derived from different indicators is a valuable test of systematics . in this section",
    "we compare results from the fp work of smac with the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) study of lauer & postman ( 1984 ) ( lp ) and the tf study of giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( sci / ii ) .",
    "the average errors in the cluster distance measurements for the smac , lp and sci / ii samples are 0.026 , 0.081 and 0.022 dex respectively .",
    "one potential problem is that different surveys do nt always select precisely the same physical structure .",
    "in particular , fp samples concentrate on the cluster core whereas tf samples cover a wider spatial area .",
    "if different physical structures are selected then this may result in a disagreement in the mean redshift adopted for the cluster . in figure 4",
    "we compare the cluster redshifts used by smac with those of lp and sci / ii .",
    "the agreement is good with an average absolute velocity difference of 180 kms@xmath7 .    in figure 5 we present the distance - distance comparisons of smac with lp and sci / ii .",
    "the smac and lp distances are in reasonable agreement ; there is a probability of 0.06 that the measured @xmath5 would arise given the distance errors .",
    "the smac and sci / ii distances are in better agreement with a @xmath5 probability of 0.13 .    the smac - lp and smac - sci / ii",
    "peculiar velocity comparisons are presented in figure 6 . for both comparisons",
    "the agreement is again reasonable for the measurement errors . for the smac - lp comparsion",
    "there is a probability of 0.15 that the observed @xmath5 would arise given the peculiar velocity errors . for the smac - sci / ii comparison",
    "the probability is 0.08 . in this comparison",
    "most clusters are in good agreement and form a tight group of points at the centre of the plot .",
    "this is further illustrated in figure 7 where we display the differences in the measured peculiar velocities .",
    "the most discrepant cluster is hydra(a1060 ) ; @xmath18(smac)=+260@xmath12183 kms@xmath7 , @xmath18(sci / ii)=320@xmath12142 kms@xmath7 .",
    "we have used the smac data to address three aspects of cluster distances and have concluded that :    1 .",
    "while there is no evidence for significant differences in the stellar populations of the smac fp cluster sample as determined by the @xmath3 relation , this is a relatively poor tool to assess if intrinsic cluster - to - cluster variations bias the fp distances . 2 .",
    "the smac dataset of 56 clusters does not support the claim made by gibbons , fruchter and bothun ( 1998 ) that the fp scatter is related to cluster peculiar velocity .",
    "3 .    the smac fp and lp bcg distances are in reasonable agreement with only four out of 41 clusters being discrepant at greater than the 2@xmath0 level .",
    "the smac fp and sci / ii tf distances are in good agreement with only two out of 30 clusters discrepant at greater than the 2@xmath0 level .",
