    "one fascinating feature of perovskites is that they exhibit a large variety of structural phase transitions . the variety of transition behavior and low - temperature distorted structures depend on the individual compound . among the perovskites",
    "one finds ferroelectric ( fe ) crystals such as batio@xmath0 , knbo@xmath0 ( displaying three phase transitions ) , and pbtio@xmath0 ( displaying only one transition ) , antiferroelectrics such as pbzro@xmath0 , and materials such as srtio@xmath0 that exhibit other non - polar antiferrodistortive ( afd ) instability involving the rotation of the oxygen octahedra  @xcite .    with the rapidly advancing miniaturization of ferroelectric devices and the use of thin films",
    ", attention is focusing on the role played by surfaces and interfaces in the overall performance of the materials .",
    "the effects of surfaces on the structural phase transitions have become an issue of significant importance because the surface can affect the structural behavior of the perovskites by modifying the strength of various instabilities .",
    "lead titanate is a clear example . in pbtio@xmath0 ( pt )",
    ", ferroelectricity is due to the condensation of a @xmath1 unstable phonon in which the oxygen octahedra shift against the pb sub - lattice .",
    "the ground state consists of shifts along ( 001 ) accompanied by a tetragonal lattice strain which stabilizes this direction .",
    "@xcite however , complete phonon dispersions for the ideal perovskite structure pbtio@xmath0 as determined by density functional calculations show ferroelectric ( @xmath1 ) and also rotational antiferrodistotive ( @xmath2 type ) instabilities .",
    "@xcite in bulk , the fe and afd instabilities compete with each other and the fe lattice distortion suppresses the afd distortion , but the proximity to a surface modifies that balance . recently , an antiferrodistortive reconstruction of the pbtio@xmath0 ( 001 ) surface has been found using grazing incidence x - ray scattering . the atomic structure of the surface consist of a single layer of an afd structure with oxygen cages rotated by 10@xmath3 around the [ 001 ] axis through the ti ions .",
    "@xcite latter on , the afd reconstruction at the pbo - terminated ( 001 ) surface was reproduced by bungaro and rabe using ab - initio calculations .",
    "@xcite they also found for in - plane polarized films that the fe and afd distortions coexist in the proximity of the surface .",
    "regarding device applications , out - of - plane polarized films are more relevant .",
    "therefore , it is worth investigating also the effects of the surface reconstruction on the out - of - plane ferroelectricity , since it was speculated that the afd reconstruction may be related to the dead layer often postulated to explain the observed decrease in ferroelectric character in thin films .",
    "@xcite    the realistic simulation of pt thin - films is a theoretical challenge due to the interplay of polar and non - polar instabilities at the surface . although first - principles methods are extremely precise and include thoroughly electronic effects , they are quite computer demanding .",
    "so , these calculations are restricted to the investigation of zero - temperature properties of perovskites involving a rather small number of atoms . for the study of the thermal behavior , or to handle larger system sizes , other methods are necessary . during the last years",
    ", the effective hamiltonian approach has been used for the investigation of thin film properties  @xcite . however , for the simulation of pb - based perovskite thin - films the coexistence of rotational and fe distortions should be explicitly considered .",
    "@xcite atomistic simulations based on interatomic potentials can account naturally for the presence of competing instabilities .",
    "however , the validity of any atomistic simulation study depends to considerable extent on the quality of the potentials used .",
    "the interatomic potential approach firmly grounded by having its parameters fitted against results of first - principles calculations is a promising technique for investigating thin - film properties of pb - based perovskites . in this paper",
    "we investigate the ferroelectric properties of pt thin films using a shell model developed completely from first - principles calculations .",
    "we investigate first if the model developed for the bulk describes properly surface properties .",
    "then the ferroelectric behavior of ultrathin films under open - circuit electrical boundary conditions are investigated .",
    "the approach we follow in this work is based on the atomistic modeling using interatomic potentials .",
    "we indeed found that the shell model approach does provide computationally efficient and confident methodology for the simulation of ferroelectric perovskites , including bulk properties of pure crystals  @xcite and solid solutions  @xcite , superlattices  @xcite , surface and thin films properties .",
    "@xcite in the shell model , each atom is represented by a massive core coupled to a massless shell , and the relative core - shell displacement describes the atomic polarization .",
    "the model contains coulombic long - range and pairwise short - range interactions . in the present study we use the model developed in ref  @xcite which contains 4@xmath4 order core - shell couplings and short - range interactions described by two different types of potentials .",
    "a rydberg potential ( @xmath5 ) is used for the pb - ti , pb - o and ti - o pairs , and a buckingham potential ( @xmath6 ) is used for o - o interactions .",
    "the model was developed completely from first - principles calculations within the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the parameters were adjusted to reproduce a wide number of lda results , including lattice dynamics and total energy calculations .",
    "the resulting model was able to reproduce delicate properties of pt in good agreement with lda results .",
    "however , as a consequence of the lda , volume and volume dependent properties are underestimated with respect to experimental values .",
    "for example , the model gives a tetragonal ground state with a lattice parameter a=3.859@xmath7 , a tetragonal distortion c / a=1.043 , and a spontaneous polarization p=@xmath8c/@xmath9 , while the experimental data are a=3.90@xmath7 , c / a=1.065 , and p=@xmath10c/@xmath9 .",
    "the underestimation of the static structural properties is translated via the adjusted model to the finite temperature behavior .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations showed a cubic - tetragonal transition at t@xmath11 = 450k , 300k below the experimental value .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative temperature behavior of lattice parameters and polarization was correctly reproduced .",
    "see reference  @xcite for more details .",
    "the investigation of the surface properties is carried out using an isolated slab geometry with periodic boundary conditions in the x - y plane . the long ranged electrostatic energy and forces",
    "are calculated by a direct sum method  @xcite .",
    "the equilibrated zero - temperature structure of the slabs was determined by a zero - temperature quench until the force on each individual ion was less than 0.001 ev/@xmath7 . to mimic the two dimensional clamping and straining of the film due to the presence of a substrate",
    ", we force the simulation cell to be square in the x - y plane .",
    "the parameters of the model were derived to describe perfect crystal properties , and it is not guaranteed that the same potentials are suitable to describe the surface properties of pt . in the bulk , the underlying potential surface is a result of a delicate balance between long range coulomb , short range , and core - shell interactions . such balance could change significantly at the surface , where the atomic environment changes due to the discontinuity of the crystal .",
    "so , it is important to check if the model developed for the bulk proves also successful for describing surface properties .",
    "a first - principles study for ( 001 ) surfaces of cubic pt has been performed by meyer , padilla and vanderbilt using @xmath12 surface periodicity  @xcite . as a first step ,",
    "we take these first - principles calculations as benchmark results to compare with . to this end",
    "we determined the atomic equilibrium position for both pbo- and tio- symmetrically terminated 7-layer periodic slabs .",
    "we set the in - plane lattice parameter to the cubic equilibrium value yielded by the model in bulk , a=3.887 , and we relaxed the atomic positions from the ideal positions only in the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "the results obtained for the atomic relaxations for both slabs are listed in table  [ tab1 ] , whereas the values for the interlayer distances and rumplings are listed in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "ab - initio results are shown in parenthesis as reference .",
    "the model reproduces satisfactorily the relaxation direction of the atoms , the change in the interlayer distances , and atomic rumplings . for the case of the pbo surface , the equilibrium termination for pt  @xcite , the numerical values are in very good agreement with the ab - initio ones .",
    "the average surface relaxation energy obtained by the model @xmath13 is also in quite good agreement with the ab - initio result of 0.210 ev .",
    ".atomic relaxations perpendicular to the surface ( @xmath14 ) of the pbo ( left panel ) and the tio@xmath15 ( right panel ) terminated surface in the cubic phase .",
    "@xmath14 are given as percent of the theoretical unit cell parameter a. for comparison , ab - initio results ( ref  @xcite ) are shown in parentheses . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it was pointed out that the enhancement of the afd distortion at the pbo surface is a consequence of the particular chemistry of pb , due to its tendency to move off - center and form strong covalent pb - o bonds  @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that this electronic effect , which has been showed to be an important factor for ferroelectricity in pbtio@xmath0  @xcite , can be mimicked at the atomic level by a shell model . in this less - sophisticated approach ,",
    "the afd surface reconstruction is obtained just as a result of the change in the balance of long - range coulombic and short - range interactions at the surface .",
    "we use the atomistic model to explore zero - temperature ferroelectric properties in pt ultrathin films .",
    "we consider only pbo - terminated surfaces because they are the most stable ones .",
    "@xcite the simulation cell contains @xmath16 unit cells with periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath17 plane .",
    "the in - plane lattice parameter was set and clamped to the model equilibrium value for the tetragonal bulk a=3.859@xmath7 .",
    "since this value is close to the lattice parameter of srtio@xmath0 , this clamped condition simulates the strain effect of a srtio@xmath0 substrate .",
    "we have performed standard - atomic relaxation methods to determine the zero temperature structure in slabs from 2 to 10 unit cells thick that contains from 1200 to 5200 atoms , respectively . in each case , the relaxation started with atoms slightly displaced from their ideal cubic positions .",
    "after a first quenching , the system is iteratively warmed - up and quenched again in order to eliminate possible metastable configurations . to analyze the results , we define the cell parameter @xmath18 as the distance between two consecutive pbo planes , and the local polarization",
    "is defined as the polarization of a ti - centered unit cell .",
    "a decrease in tetragonality is an important effect produced by the presence of the surface .",
    "figure 1 provides detailed microscopic information about the average cell - by - cell tetragonal distortion @xmath19 for a 10-unit cells thick slab .",
    "it can be seen that the tetragonality of all unit cells in the slab is considerable lower than in the bulk ( @xmath20 for the bulk ) .",
    "the stronger reduction is observed for the surface cells which are practically cubic ( @xmath21 ) while the tetragonality increases towards the interior of the slab reaching the value @xmath22 . as the imposed in - plane lattice",
    "parameter corresponds with the one of ferroelectric bulk pt , we can expect that the tetragonality gradually converges to the bulk value when the film thickness increases .",
    "in fact , we have obtained that , while the tetragonality of the outermost layer practically does not depend on film thickness ( surface relaxation effects are predominant for these layers ) , the inner cells display a thickness dependence .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the c / a ratio with film thickness for cells in the middle of the slab .",
    "we can roughly estimate from the extrapolation of figure 2 that @xmath23 ( @xmath24 22 unit cells ) is the lower - bond estimate of the slab thickness requiered to reach the tetragonality of the bulk in the center of the film .",
    "the strong thickness dependence of tetragonality is in qualitative agreement with recent experimental measurements which showed that the average c / a ratio decreases substantially for films thinner than @xmath25  @xcite .          in slabs under ideal open - circuit electrical boundary conditions ,",
    "as we are considering here , out - of - plane ferroelectricity manifests above a critical thickness , through the formation of stripe domains of alternating polarity .",
    "these domains are effective in neutralizing the depolarized field and stabilizing the ferroelectric phase , even without electrodes.@xcite the observation of stripe domains below the ferroelectric transition in epitaxial pbtio@xmath0 ultrathin films on srtio@xmath0 substrates was reported from x - ray scattering  @xcite , and the ferroelectric phase was found to be stable for thickness down to 3 unit cells  @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows the cell - by - cell out - of - plane polarization profile of a chain perpendicular to the surface of slabs of 4 and 5 unit cell width .",
    "it is clear that under the imposed stress and electrical boundary conditions , the model gives a critical thickness ( @xmath26 ) for ferroelectricity of 4 unit cells ( @xmath26 is defined as the maximun thickness at which polarization is zero ) . in the 4-cell slab",
    "the surface cells develop a small inward polarization of @xmath27 due to surface atomic relaxations ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) while the polarization of the two inner cells is practically zero . in the 5-cell slab , individual chains have a net out - of - plane polarization but the average polarization of the slab is zero due to the development of stripe domains ( the evolution of the polarization at the center of the slab with film thickness is shown in figure 2 ) .",
    "the inner cells display a local polarization of @xmath28 , that is 0.33 of the bulk value .",
    "the surface cells present an even stronger reduction of polarization .",
    "it is very important to point out , however , that the polarization of the surface cells in the 5-cell ferroelectric slab is considerable larger than in the 4-cell non - ferroelectric one , it increases from @xmath27 to @xmath29 .",
    "this polarization enhancement indicates that the surface layer , which forms an afd reconstruction , also participates in the ferroelectricity .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath26 obtained with the model is two unit cells larger than the experimental one reported in ref .",
    "this difference could arise from the fact the model was developed to reproduce the lda ground state of bulk pt , and consecuently the ferroelectric instability is underestimated .",
    "another possibility is that we are not explicity simulating the presence of a substrate ( although we are considering its strain effects ) which modifies the boundary condition at one face of the film .",
    "atomistic investigations of the substrate effects on the critical thickness are in progress .    in the simulations ,",
    "the in - plane lattice parameter was set to the tetragonal bulk value a=3.859@xmath7 , so a vanishing in - plane polarization component could be expected .",
    "however , this is not the case and the slabs develop a polarization component along the ( 110 ) direction .",
    "for the bulk , the coupling of the ferroelectric soft mode with strain is the main driving force for the stabilization of the ( 001)-polarized tetragonal phase over the ( 111)-polarized rhombohedral one  @xcite . in films , the decrease in tetragonality favors the stabilization of a phase with a non - vanishing in - plane polarization component , above and also below the critical thickness .",
    "figure 4 shows the change of the average in - plane polarization with film thickness .",
    "the reduction of tetragonality produces that the in - plane polarization increases when the film thickness decreases .",
    "locally , a strong increment of the in - plane polarization at the surface is observed ( see the profile in the inset of figure 4 ) .",
    "the polarization decreases towards the interior of the slab .",
    "for thick enough films , it is expected that the interior of the slab reachs the vanishing in - plane polarization of the bulk .",
    "we showed above that non - polar slabs displayed an afd surface reconstruction .",
    "polar slabs show a surface reconstruction with a similar rotation angle which is independent on the slab thickness . however , one difference is that neighboring planes of octahedra along the rotation axis rotates in - phase instead of out - of - phase .",
    "in fact , for the polar slabs , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the first , second and third layers , respectively .",
    "we note that unstable modes at the m and r points , which are associated with oxygen rotation instabilities , have similar frequencies and compete to each other in the cubic bulk  @xcite . for the bulk , the model yields to an energy difference of only 2 mev per unit cell between the m and r distortions ( @xmath33 e = 1.2 mev per unit cell from ab - initio calculations  @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of the polarized surface affects these two competing structural instabilities stabilizing m - type distortions at the surface .",
    "finally , we show a peculiar effect of the afd surface reconstruction on the in - plane polarization profile . although the average in - plane polarization is oriented along the ( 110 ) direction , unit cells are not uniformly polarized along that direction",
    "this can be visualized by the top view of the surface showed in figure 5 .",
    "we will consider the displacements of the pb atoms to make the description simpler .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the pb atoms displace mainly along ( 100 ) directions ( see the arrows ) in such a way that half of the pb atoms are displaced along a ( 100 ) direction , and the other half along a ( 010 ) direction .",
    "although the effect is much stronger at the surface , this local behavior is observed throughout the ultrathin film . this polarization profile , which produces an average in - plane polarization along the ( 110 ) direction , is a consequence of the oxygen octahedra rotation plus the tendency of pb to move off - center shortening pb - o bonds .        in summary",
    ", we have shown that the delicate balance of lattice strain and polar and non - polar instabilities , which is responsible for the observed tetragonal ground - state of bulk pbtio@xmath0 and the afd structure of the surface , is accurately simulated by an interatomic potential approach with parameters computed from first - principles calculations . in ultrathin films ,",
    "a remarkable decrease in tetragonality leads to the stabilization of a phase with non - vanishing in - plane polarization , above and also below the critical thickness ( @xmath26 ) for ferroelectricity . under the imposed stress and electrical boundary conditions ,",
    "@xmath26 was found to be 4 unit cells .",
    "the surface layer , which forms an afd reconstruction , also participates in the ferroelectricity .",
