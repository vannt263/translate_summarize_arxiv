    "the model predicts that @xmath69 decreases with increasing gain @xmath51 , which is consistent with the experimental data . the highest value of of @xmath69 is therefore achieved in the weak squeezing limit ( @xmath70 ) , where higher photon numbers become negligible and the single photon probability is simply given by the signal detection efficiency @xmath66 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . in our experiment , this efficiency is bounded from below by @xmath73 , which yields a maximum witness @xmath74 .",
    "evaluating the experimental data , the maximum witness that we could achieve was @xmath75 , when @xmath25 . as this reduction was most likely caused by dark counts and background noise , that were not included in the model ,",

    "frequency up - converted states were shown to possess quantum non - gaussianity and we achieved a significance of up to 16 standard deviations .",
    "the single photon contribution in the states with qng certified with more than five standard deviations was up to 22.6% ( with @xmath46 , @xmath76ns ) .",
    "the @xmath2 values were smaller than 0.05 ( @xmath25 , @xmath77ns ) .",
    "our result shows that negative wigner functions are also within reach in up - converted states when the optical losses were minimized .",
    "in particular , insufficient filtering of the trigger mode , limited quantum efficiencies of the apds and propagation losses prevented us from fully benefiting from the high up - conversion efficiency , which was determined to be @xmath78 .",
    "one or two additional filter cavities with different free spectral ranges would suppress uncorrelated modes more efficiently , but a more complex setup with technically elaborate cavity locking techniques would be required .",
    "anti - reflection coated fibers would minimize the propagation losses , since the coupling efficiency could be increased and an optical isolator would no longer be required .",
    "nonetheless , with such improvements we expect that our setup is capable of reaching a single photon contribution of 60% , mainly set by the high up - conversion efficiency ( @xmath79 ) and quantum efficiency of the apds ( 70% ) .",
