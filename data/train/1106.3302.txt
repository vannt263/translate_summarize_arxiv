    "scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) are extensively used to probe the quasiparticle spectra of high temperature superconductors , especially of the cuprate materials such as bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bi2212)@xcite .",
    "these studies have contributed immensely in obtaining insight into superconducting and pseudogap phases of these materials owing to the very high spatial and energy resolution of the spectroscopy .",
    "the full experimental potential of stm / sts is , however , far from exploited , since the chemical and spatial resolution as well as the directional selectivity could , in principle , be improved by overcoming various challenges related to intrinsic properties of stm .    the first challenge is related to the fact that the signal from superconducting layers is filtered by insulating oxide layers .",
    "in addition , the signal does not arrive at the microscope tip directly from the site below the tip but rather through symmetry driven tunneling channels .",
    "hence , experimentally observed spectral features are not only distorted by filtering , but ascertaining their spatial origin becomes harder the deeper within the sample is their source .",
    "another factor to be aware of is that the electronic and geometrical properties of the microscope tip may also affect stm images . in standard interpretation",
    ", the tip is assumed symmetric to rotations around the vertical axis ( ` s - wave ' ) .",
    "the relative bluntness of the tip suggests this assumption and , furthermore , the metallic nature of common tip materials does not favor oriented `` dangling '' orbitals , and specific effects of tip geometry and electronic structure are usually ignored .",
    "however , this interpretation has been challenged by a variety of sophisticated theoretical studies @xcite , which , on the one hand show that the closer the tip is to the surface , the more important the symmetry of tip orbitals is to the stm image and , on the other hand , they indicate that s - wave tips might not be able to produce images with atomic resolution .",
    "notably , the relative importance of tip orbitals with different symmetries in the stm signal can be controlled by varying the tip - surface distance , or alternatively , by functionalizing the tip by attaching particular atoms / molecules at the apex of the tip .    in various experimental studies@xcite ,",
    "the tip properties have been deliberately modified for better spatial or chemical selectivity by picking up a molecule , e.g. co , o@xmath0 or n@xmath0 , from the surface to the apex of the tip after which the plain tip results have been compared to the results with a functionalized tip .",
    "this has proven to improve chemical selectivity in adsorbate on a solid surface system since each surface species responds in an individual way to the change of tip symmetry due to functionalization . even in the case of relatively complicated molecules , such as pentacene attached to the tip",
    ", the contrast of differential conductance maps revealing the geometric shape of molecular orbitals is surprisingly sharpened @xcite by the enhanced directionality of the probe - sample overlap due to the dominance of the @xmath2 or @xmath3 type localized orbitals closest to the sample surface .",
    "the idea of utilizing a functionalized tip is further encouraged by the fact that the resolution of atomic force microscopy ( afm ) studies is enhanced by using co molecule attached to the metallic tip @xcite , although improving the resolution and selectivity in the case of afm has a different physical basis from stm .",
    "the preceding work on molecular adsorbate systems provides motivation for considering functionalized tips for investigating cuprate materials , where the interesting physics is found at layers not immediately on the surface .",
    "we can foresee many uses of functionalized tips in probing these materials .",
    "an obvious application would be a more accurate probe for the surface properties . in the case of bi2212 ,",
    "to date one has mostly observed the bi atoms of the surface layer in topographic stm images .",
    "information from the oxygen atoms of the surface layer has been difficult to obtain , and hence stm provides limited ability to observe the real symmetry of the surface .",
    "a more involved application is related to the di / dv spectra . as shown in our previous studies@xcite ,",
    "the spectra are mappings of the electronic structure of the cuprate layer , filtered by the bio and sro layers , which sit on top of the cuprate layers .",
    "although the signal can be theoretically resolved into partial signals of different origin , the sts experiment measures a signal combined from different sources and , furthermore , the information from different directions in momentum space is integrated into a single outgoing signal .",
    "a possible means of decomposing the sts spectrum experimentally is to measure topographic spectral maps .",
    "in practice , real space and fourier transformed maps differentiating electron and hole states have been produced in order to recognize direction dependent underlying electronic order @xcite",
    ". a third possible application would be investigation of symmetry properties related to nematicity transitions in the subsurface electronic structure at low values of doping , where the oxygen atoms of cuo@xmath4 layers in different directions appear non - equivalent below the pseudogap transition temperature @xmath5 as shown in ref . .",
    "+ in fact , functionalized tips may well have been used inadvertently in studies of bi2212 .",
    "it has been reported that tip resolution can improve dramatically after use , and it has been suggested that this may be due to the attachment of a bi atom to the tunneling tip @xcite . here",
    "we will explore the effects of tips , which are dominated by a single atomic orbital of varying symmetry .",
    "we find that such tips can not only couple with different surface orbitals , but can also affect the interference between tunneling channels from the cuprate layer to the microscope tip .",
    "this suggests possibilities for investigating irregularities within the cuprate layers , which are not directly accessible to the stm tip , and thus reveal features invisible to stm / sts experiments with a symmetric tip . in this way ,",
    "our study advances the understanding of matrix element effects in stm.@xcite    this article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii briefly describes the model utilized in this study .",
    "section iii presents calculations of the effect of tip symmetry on topographical maps , stm corrugations and di / dv spectra at various high symmetry sites .",
    "in section iv we show how a hidden irregularity within the cuprate layer can be studied by comparing results obtained with different tip symmetries , among other results .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section v.",
    "although the model used is essentially the same as in ref . , we provide an overview here for the sake of completeness .",

    "we consider four different tip symmetries which can be divided into two groups .",
    "these consist of @xmath19- and @xmath30-orbitals , which are symmetric to rotation around z - axis , accompanied with two choices of horizontal @xmath33-orbitals .",

    "these two horizontal tip symmetries can also be connected to the nodal ( @xmath31 ) and antinodal ( @xmath32 ) directions .",

    "indices are combination of site and spin indices .",
    "the d - wave symmetry of the superconducting gap is modeled by taking @xmath39 to be non - zero only between the neighbouring @xmath40 orbitals , and with opposite signs for @xmath41- and @xmath42-directions , which leads to a d - wave symmetric superconducting gap @xcite .",
    "the tight - binding parameters @xmath43 are taken to be doping - independent in the spirit of the rigid band model.@xcite    the tunneling current is computed within the todorov - pendry approximation @xcite as @xmath44    the hopping integrals @xmath45 depend on the symmetry of tip and surface orbitals as well as the distances involved through the slater - koster coefficients@xcite . the tip to surface distance is usually greater than the distance between the atoms in the bulk material . to allow for this the standard slater - koster method",
    "is enhanced by an exponential decay at large distances @xcite .",
    "the slater - koster method allows one to take the directionality of both the tip and surface orbitals into account .",
    "it can be considered as a special case of the more general `` derivative rule '' of chen@xcite and a similar approach of sacks and noguera @xcite who utilize derivatives of the real space tip wave function .",
    "there is an alternative way of writing eq . :",
    "@xmath46 where @xmath47    the difference between the two formulae is that eq .",
    "emphasizes the coupling between the tip and the surface orbitals expressed by the hopping integrals @xmath48 , whereas eq . makes more transparent how tunneling takes place through the filtering layers between the tip and the superconducting layers .",
    "of course the symmetry of the tip itself is described by @xmath48 , but in order to recognize the relevant surface orbitals , it is essential to consider the filtering matrix elements , @xmath49 , as well .    the spectral function @xmath50 depends on both regular and anomalous green functions as shown below @xmath51 to conclude , the formulae given above provide not only the total @xmath52 spectrum , but also an explicit form of the filtering effect on the cuprate layer , and decompose the density matrix of the cuprate orbitals into regular and anomalous spectral terms .",
    "the topographic maps of fig . [ topo](b - e ) are calculated using eq . in constant current mode ,",
    "i.e. , there is a feedback loop varying the tip - surface distance in order to retain the tunneling current constant . for bias voltage",
    "we choose @xmath53 we also follow the common practice of accompanying topographic maps with corrugation curves in fig .",

    "the vertical scale represents the height change the tip experiences along the route .",
    "curves for @xmath31 and @xmath32 are similar in overall shape yet they differ strongly in relative amplitude .",
    "this shows that they connect at least partially to different surface orbitals .",
    "note that each curve was shifted downwards by its own average tip surface distance thus making all curves zero centered.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    experimental topographic maps typically resemble the calculated maps for s - wave tip with a high intensity at the position of the surface bi atoms . within the tersoff - hamann type analysis @xcite",
    ", a high intensity signal is attributed to a high local density of electrons . as fig .",
    "[ ldos](a ) indicates , the surface bi atoms have a large density of states over a wide range of energies around the fermi energy .",
    "this was demonstrated already in our earlier work @xcite where we further related this to the coupling between the @xmath30 orbitals of bi and the @xmath54 orbital of the cu atom below through the intermediate @xmath30 orbital of the apical oxygen .",
    "in contrast , orbitals of o(bi ) contribute to the bio bands , which contain a gap around the fermi - energy . in fig .",
    "[ ldos](a ) these states are broadened since we have invoked a fermi liquid type self - energy in the noncuprate layers @xcite .    as seen in figs .",
    "[ topo ] ( b ) and [ topo ] ( c ) , tips with @xmath19- as well as @xmath30-symmetry expose the bi atoms as bright spots .",
    "this is hardly surprising , especially in the case of the rather strongly oriented @xmath30 tip orbital .",
    "our computations also suggest that @xmath30 symmetry slightly sharpens the contrast of the topographic map , but as shown in the corrugation curves of fig .",
    "[ corrugation ] , the effect may not be experimentally significant . tips with in - plane p - symmetry show striking changes in topographical maps . in the case where the tip orbital lies along the top - hollow ( nodal ) direction , @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ topo](c ) ) , the contrast is inverted so that o(bi ) atoms appear as bright spots .",
    "however , as discussed further in section iv below , visibility of oxygen atoms is spurious since the tunneling signal is still dominated by overlap between the horizontal tip orbital and the @xmath30 orbitals of bi atoms .",
    "this is also the obvious reason why the bright spots in the topographical image lose their sharpness .",
    "the change in contrast becomes even more dramatic in the case of the tip orbital lying along the top - bridge ( anti - nodal ) direction , @xmath32 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ topo ] ( d ) , the fourfold symmetry is now broken , and bright lines appear perpendicular to the orbital direction .",
    "in addition , intensity maxima are seen at bridge sites when the bonding oxygen orbital points to the same direction as the tip orbital .",
    "this indicates that in this case also the nature of the topographic image is driven the overlap between the tip orbital and the @xmath30 orbital of bi atoms .",
    "the intensity patterns in topographic images can be quantified as corrugation curves , such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ corrugation ] .",
    "interestingly , the horizontal tip orbitals not only invert the contrast of the topographic image , but they are also more sensitive to the horizontal position than tips with rotational symmetry around the z - axis .",
    "this is seen in the more strongly varying corrugation as the tip is scanned between the top , bridge and hollow sites .",
    "these differences , originating from the symmetry dependent nature of the tip - surface overlap , might be useful in pursuing a better lateral resolution in stm imaging .",
    "unfortunately , our theoretical predictions can not be compared directly with measurements at this time since we are not aware of any experimental stm literature on bi2212 where a deliberately functionalized tip has been deployed .",
    "however , some insight can be obtained by considering a study such as that of ref . , which discusses the effects of attaching o@xmath4 functionalizing molecules to a tungsten tip for investigating a metal phtalocyanine monolayer on an au(111 ) surface .",
    "ref . finds selectivity with respect to molecular orbitals between normal and o@xmath4-functionalized tips , and observes the stm pattern of the adsorbate monolayer to rotate as different tips are used to probe the surface .",
    "the shape and intensity of a @xmath52 spectrum depend on the tip symmetry as well as its position . in figs .",
    "[ ldos](b - d ) , the @xmath52 curves are calculated at @xmath55 vertical distance between the tip and the surface atoms . at this tip - surface distance",
    ", the gap features are clearly observed , and calculations indicate that the signal predominantly comes through the @xmath30 orbitals of the bi atoms .",
    "there are clear changes in the vhs features at @xmath56 - 0.15 to  -0.4  ev with tip site and orbital symmetry : they seem to vanish for the s - wave tip at a hollow site , and for both the horizontal p - wave tip orbitals at a top site .",
    "the apparent reason for this is the increasing spectral weight of the bio bands with increasing binding energy .",
    "these configurations seem to favour a relatively large overlap between the tip orbital and the p - orbitals of o(bi ) atoms . for an @xmath19-wave tip on the top site ,",
    "the @xmath52 curve resembles the bi @xmath57 ldos , as expected .",
    "however , this is also true for the horizontal @xmath33-wave tips at the bridge or hollow site .",
    "these results support the conventional assumption that the experimental tips are predominantly @xmath19-wave .",
    "we note also a trend in the overall intensities of the spectra .",
    "as expected , horizontal p - symmetry of the tip orbital tends to decrease spectral intensity due to decreasing overlap . for s - wave symmetry , the intensity is highest for the top site and the lowest for the hollow site . for the horizontal p - symmetry ,",
    "the top site gives the lowest intensity due to antisymmetry between @xmath30 of bi and the tip - orbital .",
    "moving the tip either to bridge or hollow site allows an increased overlap between the tip orbital and @xmath30 of bi .     of bi , @xmath58 of o(bi ) and @xmath30 of o(bi ) .",

    "these can include substitutional impurities , such as zn or ni replacing a cu atom @xcite , or dopant atoms like oxygen , the fingerprints of which have been discussed both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "however , perhaps the most fascinating potential application may be the @xmath59 nematic intracell symmetry breaking of the subsurface electronic structure observed at very low values of hole doping in the pseudogap phase@xcite .",
    "this phase transition in the electronic order is not observed in the topographic images , but rather in @xmath52 maps and in the so called z - maps derived from the differential conductance data .",
    "the relevance to the present theoretical considerations arises from the fact that the subsurface bonding oxygen atoms in cuo@xmath4 appear non - equivalent when this low - symmetry phase is mapped .",
    "we propose that breaking the symmetry of the tip by functionalization would give additional information about the nematic phase .",
    "note that the observed patterns are difficult to interpret due to the filtering effect of the bio and sro layers .",
    "it is interesting therefore to explore whether different tip symmetries can provide insight by probing different tunneling channels . in earlier",
    "work@xcite we showed that the bonding oxygens of the cuo@xmath4 layers are invisible to a spherically symmetric tip placed right above that atom .",
    "hence we choose a local perturbation at this bonding oxygen .",
    "the simplest kind of perturbation is a change of the onsite energy , which could be induced by a be nearby dopant atom .",
    "figure [ channels](d ) shows a tunneling tip positioned above a bonding oxygen in the cuprate layer , equivalent to the bridge site of fig .  1 .",
    "to simulate the effect of a nearby impurity , we modify the onsite energy of the @xmath33-orbital along the bond by -2.0 ev.@xcite in fig . [",

    "although the difference between the two ldos results is striking ( fig .",
    "[ channels](c ) ) , the spectra obtained by a rotationally symmetric tip do not reflect this difference .",
    "this can be explained by the results of ref . , where we showed that two tunneling channels in antiphase are open between the oxygen and the tip ( fig .",
    "[ channels](d ) ) , causing destructive interference between the corresponding signals . [ the observed signal comes from different channels involving the cu atoms . ]    in fig .",
    "[ channels](d ) we show the di / dv curve measured by a tip with @xmath32 orbital , and a clear difference is seen between the spectra of the regular and perturbed oxygens .",
    "the shapes of ldos ( b ) and the spectra ( d ) are not identical , but the relative change of the spectrum follows that of ldos , especially over the range between @xmath60 the change in the spectrum of fig .",
    "[ channels](d ) is caused by a reversal of the relative phase between the two tunneling channels in fig .",
    "[ channels](a ) due to p - type symmetry of the tip , a point to which we will return below .",
    "this result suggests that experiments probing the breakdown of @xmath61 symmetry , such as those in ref .",
    ", could be further clarified by varying the tip symmetry .",
    "a proper understanding of the observed topographical images and spectra requires an analysis of the filtering matrix elements @xmath49 which describe the coupling between the tip and the surface orbitals , propagation across the oxide layers , and coupling between the superconducting cuprate layer and the covering oxide layers . starting from the latter ,",
    "the cuprate layer is coupled to the oxide layers mainly through the overlap between the @xmath54 orbitals of the cu atoms and the @xmath30 orbitals of the apical oxygen above .",
    "the propagation through the oxide layers is mediated by @xmath30 orbitals of the apical oxygen and the bi atom above on the surface . when the tip symmetry is varied , the relevant factor is that @xmath30 of the surface bi is the dominant surface orbital mediating the signal from the cuprate layer to the microscope tip .",
    "hence , the analysis of the observed results can be built on the overlap between the tip orbital and the @xmath30 orbitals of the bi atoms in the vicinity of the tip .",
    "while other surface orbitals are present , they are not strongly coupled to the cuprate bands , and hence they have a relatively low spectral weight in the vicinity of the fermi energy .",
    "thus , the horizontal p - orbitals of bi and o(bi ) atoms are the dominant orbitals of the bio bands related to the `` bismuth pocket '' states above fermi - level and the corresponding valence bands below the `` spaghetti '' of bands ( fig .",

    "since only the bi @xmath57 surface orbital is important , the analysis of the various tip orbitals is rather straightforward .",

    "the overlap between the tip and @xmath30 of a surface bi is lowest when the tip is directly above the bi atom . in the case of @xmath31",
    "both the bridge and hollow sites seem to give a large overlap between tip orbital and @xmath30 of bi , but the hollow sites appear brighter since the overlap between the horizontal p - orbitals contributing to bio bands is larger at this site . for @xmath32 the fourfold symmetry",

    "since the orbital is oriented along the bonds between cu atoms , there is a zero overlap line when following the bonding direction perpendicular to the orbital orientation . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath32 overlaps strongly with the two bi atoms at the bridge site in the antinodal direction of @xmath32 .",
    "moving towards the vicinal hollow sites preserves the strong overlap . at the hollow site ,",
    "a strong overlap with four bi atoms can be found .",
    "since the distance is @xmath63-fold as compared to the bridge site , overall the overlap remains roughly the same when moving from the bridge site to the hollow site , resulting in bright and dark stripes in fig .",

    "the situation is of course reversed if the bonding oxygen is replaced by an @xmath19-wave symmetric perturbation , i.e. there is a constructive interference for @xmath19- and @xmath30-symmetric tips",
    ". this explains our comparison of a spectrum at the bridge site for unperturbed system with a vacancy at the site of the bonding oxygen .    with regard to the @xmath59 transition",
    ", the main practical conclusion of our analysis is that obtaining information related to the non - equivalent bonding oxygens can be enhanced by manipulating the tip symmetry by functionalizing molecules .",
    "this suggests that an s - wave symmetric tip gathers the signal from a neighbourhood of the bonding oxygen below , while a p - wave tip should be more selective to the on - site oxygen orbitals .",
    "we have investigated the effect of different tip symmetries on topographic stm images and di / dv spectra .",
    "the change in tip symmetry can lead to contrast inversion and even to the breaking up of the @xmath61 symmetry due to strong differences in the nature of the tip - surface overlap .",
    "furthermore , the corrugation curves show that the horizontal p - orbitals at the apex of the tip would be more sensitive to position of the surface atoms .",
    "the di / dv curves reveal the leading sample states ( cuo@xmath0-band , bio - band or some more localized states ) to which different symmetries tend to couple .",
    "more strikingly , changing the symmetry of the tip can be used to change the relative phase between two open tunneling channels .",
    "this could be applied to detect subsurface irregularities which would otherwise be invisible to stm .",
