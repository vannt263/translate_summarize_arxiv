    "the physics of high energy heavy ion collisions attracts strong attention of the physics community as creation of a new type of matter , the quark - gluon plasma , is expected in such collisions . during just a few years of the bnl rhic operation many new phenomena has been observed , such as strong elliptic flow  @xcite , and suppression of the high transverse momentum two particle back - to - back correlations  @xcite . note that both of the above mentioned discoveries at rhic have been made with help of correlations techniques : in this case analyzing azimuthal correlations .",
    "further understanding of the physics processes responsible for both phenomena , such as what happens with the energy of the away - side jet or whether the observed constituent quark scaling  @xcite in elliptic flow reflects the hadronization via quark coalescence , require further dedicated correlation studies .",
    "in general , as we try to understand the details of system evolution we will rely more and more on correlation measurements .",
    "many collaborations recently have performed measurements of either multiplicity ( such as net charge , @xmath2 ratio ) or mean transverse momentum fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the interest was driven by a possibility to observe a dramatic change in fluctuation pattern with collision energy and/or centrality indicating the phase transition .",
    "there exist theoretical prediction both for an increase of fluctuations  @xcite as well as for decrease in fluctuations  @xcite ( the latter is due to an increase in number of effective degrees of freedom in the qgp ) . at this time",
    "many new observables were introduced in the analysis .",
    "unfortunately , the various observables used by experiments almost render a valid comparison of the results difficult or even impossible .",
    "the reason for that is a persistent confusion about properties of different observables used to measure fluctuations . due to the importance of inter experiment comparison of the results , in the next section",
    "i try to give a short summary of the question along with my own recommendations for future analyzes .",
    "this part is somewhat technical , and a reader more interested in physical results may skip it and start with section ii .",
    "in a multi - particle process the correlations in particle production are described via two and many particle densities  @xcite . in this",
    "talk i use only single and two - particle densities ; those are normalized respectively by the mean multiplicity and the mean number of pairs in a given region of momentum space : _ dx ^(1)(x)=n ; _ dx_1 _",
    "dx_2 ^(2)(x_1,x_2 ) = n(n-1 ) .",
    "particle densities in general depend on a particle three momentum , e.g. rapidity , transverse momentum , and azimuthal angle , some of the arguments can be integrated out ; for brevity i use just @xmath3 . from @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "one constructs different types of correlation functions : c(x_1 , x_2 ) ^(2)(x_1,x_2 ) - ^(1)(x_1 ) ^(1)(x_2 ) ; b(x_1 , x_2 ) ; r(x_1 , x_2 ) roughly speaking @xmath6 has a meaning of a distribution of correlated pairs .",
    "the correlation function @xmath7 corresponds to the distribution of particles @xmath8 under condition that particle @xmath9 is found at @xmath10 .",
    "often , a particle of type @xmath9 is called a `` trigger '' particle and particle of type @xmath8 is called an `` associated '' particle .",
    "when particles @xmath9 and @xmath8 carry opposite charges , such as electric , baryon , or strangeness , @xmath11 , as there must be one associated particle somewhere in the momentum space that `` balances '' the charge of the trigger particle . then @xmath7 is often referred to as _ balance function_. the correlation function @xmath12 may be interpreted as the `` probability '' that a given pair is correlated .",
    "this type of the correlation function is used most often , as it is easiest to measure .",
    "defined as a ratio , it is one of the so - called _ robust _ quantities , which do not depend on single particle reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "studying the correlations in nuclear collisions one usually is interested if those are different from the correlations in elementary collision .",
    "if one superimposes a few , @xmath13 , nucleon - nucleon collisions together : ^(1),aa(x)=n_coll ^(1),nn(x ) ^(2),aa(x_1,x_2)=n_coll ^(2),nn(x_1,x_2 ) + n_coll(n_coll-1 ) ^(1),nn(x_1 ) ^(1),nn(x_2 ) . then",
    ", the balance function , @xmath14 , does not change at all , and the signal in @xmath12 gets diluted : @xmath15 .",
    "all of the above correlation functions can be calculated at fixed multiplicities . in this case",
    "they usually carry subscript @xmath16 , e.q .",
    "@xmath17 , and called _ semi - inclusive_. in nuclear collision analyses it is not possible to fix the multiplicity of individual nucleon - nucleon collisions , and one should compare the results with _ inclusive _ @xmath18 correlation function , although one should be careful comparing very peripheral collisions selected on the basis of total multiplicity .",
    "in this case the approximation of correlations in individual @xmath18 collision by inclusive correlation function can break down .",
    "many different quantities have been suggested for fluctuation analyses.before further discussion , let us formulate in general terms what constitutes a good observable .",
    "it should be ( i ) sensitive to the physics under study , ( ii ) it should be defined at the `` theoretical '' level , be apparatus / experiment independent , ( iii ) have clear physical meaning , and ( iv ) it should not be limited in scope , provide new venues for further study .",
    "if most of the proposed observables do satisfy the first requirement , very few satisfy ( ii)(iv ) .",
    "it made basically impossible to compare many of the results , even published , one to another . comparing different observables",
    "i argue that the `` old fashion '' correlation functions , and , similar the two particle transverse momentum correlations , @xmath19 , are the best in many respects .      how the two , correlations and fluctuations , are related to each other ?",
    "let us look at the so - called reduced variance : _",
    "n = 1+n _ ; _ = , where the last equation shows the relation to two particle density .",
    "if @xmath20 does not vary much over the region @xmath21 , @xmath22 gives an _ average _ of the correlation function @xmath12 over the momentum region used in the analysis .",
    "it follows that the reduced variance deviates from unity ( which is interpreted as the value for _ statistical _ fluctuations ) if and only if the correlation term @xmath23 equals zero .",
    "note that @xmath24 depends on the product of @xmath25 and @xmath23 . given",
    "@xmath23 is a robust quantity , the mean event multiplicity is not , it depends on detector efficiency , track quality cuts , etc .",
    "another feature of @xmath24 is that it can be different even if the underlying correlations are the same .",
    "let us compare fluctuations of charged particles with fluctuations of only negative ( or only positive ) particles .",
    "even if the correlations between particles have no any dependence on the particle charge , the reduced variance would show different values simply because only `` half '' of the particles are being considered .",
    "lastly note that the reduced variance can not be independent of the size of the rapidity region @xmath21 as it sometimes assumed ( it is possible only if @xmath26 which is not physical ) as often people compare its values at different @xmath21 .",
    "why one want to study @xmath27 instead of just @xmath28 ?",
    "the reason is that this product should stay constant as function of centrality in a case when @xmath29 collision is considered as a superposition of independent nucleon - nucleon collisions . in this case",
    "the correlation functions scales as @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and the product remains constant .",
    "the deviation from constant is easy to observe .",
    "experimentally , the centrality is often obtained by measuring multiplicity , and it was wrongly assumed that such quantities as reduced variance do not depend on multiplicity in general .",
    "it would be desirable to report both quantities separately . instead of",
    "@xmath25 it would be better to use @xmath32 , a quantity totally corrected for efficiency and only weakly dependent on @xmath21 .",
    "besides , if @xmath23 is known , one can check how it scales also other quantities , such as number of participating nucleons , @xmath33 , or the number of binary collisions , or something else that might be related to the number of sources of particle production .     for different centralities as function of the size of the pseudorapidity region  @xcite .",

    ", scaledwidth=97.0%,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    to avoid the so called `` volume fluctuations '' ( the effect of mixture of different impact parameter collisions in one event sample ) the fluctuations in _ particle ratios _ are often used , e.g. @xmath2 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 stand for the particle respective multiplicities in a given event . again",
    ", many `` details '' often forgotten .",
    "first , even in the original paper  @xcite , the fluctuations of particle ratios are `` reduced '' ( approximated ) to the following + -2 = + + ( _ kk+ _ -2 _ k ) .",
    "note , that we started with statistically rather bad defined quantity as any ratio of two random numbers is ( what do you do if denominator is zero ? ) and ended up with a much better behaved quantity defined via the correlation function .",
    "the question is why one would want to deal with ratios when even theoretical predictions are based on a really different quantity , which only approximately corresponds to fluctuations in ratios , namely only in the case when multiplicities of particles used in the denominator is large ?",
    "it is much better to report directly the correlation of the type @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "the latter is easier to measure ( robust quantity ) and can be analyzed for particles with very low mean multiplicities ( for example , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "mean @xmath0 event by event fluctuation analyses are often performed by calculating the event - wise mean transverse momentum , an overall event average , and the variance : p_t _ i p_t , i ; _ j p_t ; ^2_=^2 -^2 = + , where the first term in @xmath39 is defined by a single particle @xmath0 spectrum and is attributed to _ statistical _ fluctuations ( the fluctuations in a case of independent particle production with the same single - particle distributions ) .",
    "the non - trivial fluctuations ( non - statistical , sometimes called _ dynamical _ ) are included in the second term , @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "all the measures of fluctuations used by different experiments are related to this second term ( two particle transverse momentum correlation ( covariance ) ) , although sometimes in a rather complicated way . in many cases",
    "such a relation involves tracking and analysis efficiencies , and if those are not reported separately , the final results become not comparable to other experiments / measurements .    if all events in the event sample have the same multiplicity , then the equations above provide _ semi - inclusive _ mean transverse momentum and correspondingly @xmath19 .",
    "if the multiplicity vary within the event sample , there are two possibilities : one can average the semi - inclusive quantities over all events ( what is used most often , i would call it event - by - event ( ebye ) average ) or calculate true _ inclusive _ quantities ; .",
    "the latter cam be written directly using two particle density = [ edpt ] although quantitatively both definitions ( ebye and inclusive ) would give almost indistinguishable values ( unless the multiplicity is too low and event sample include events with very different multiplicities ) , theoretically , it is easier to analyze inclusive correlations .",
    "therefore my preference would be to `` migrate '' from the ebye to inclusive observables .",
    "note also that @xmath19 can be easily generalized for study of correlation between particles of different type and for differential measurements such as @xmath40 .",
    "similar to the multiplicity correlation , its centrality dependence can be tested against different hypothesis such scaling with rapidity density , number of participants , etc .",
    "recently star collaboration has reported results on integrated two particle @xmath0 correlations for au+au collisions at different collisions energies  @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fdpt62y ] shows the dependence of the two particle @xmath0 correlations on @xmath41 the size of the pseudorapidity window taken around midrapidity .",
    "the results for different centralities are shown starting from the most peripheral ( on the top , the strongest correlations ) to the most central .",
    "the dependence on the size of the pseudorapidity region is rather weak . at higher collision energy ( @xmath42  gev )",
    "the dependence is even weaker . under assumption that spectra dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity factorize , according to eq .",
    "[ edpt ] , the pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath19 should follow the one of correlation function @xmath43",

    "a simple estimate one can fit the correlation function by the form @xmath45 , which translates into @xmath46 , where @xmath47 the blue lines shown in figures 1 and 2 correspond to the same @xmath48 and describe the data well .",
    "note that the slope of @xmath19 dependence on @xmath49 changes with centrality .",
    "it is noticeably smaller for central collisions . taking into account the relation to the correlation function ,",
