    "during the past decade , seven isolated neutron stars ( inss ) , exhibiting no detectable radio pulsar activity , have been discovered in nearby regions of our galaxy via  surveys .",
    "these inss exhibit thermal emission spectra with peak energies in the far - ultraviolet or soft , from atmospheres that are thought to be amenable to theoretical modeling ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as such",
    ", they are promising candidates for precision radius measurements via  spectroscopy  measurements that ultimately aim to constrain theories of the nuclear equation of state .",
    "we are currently pursuing a long - term project to identify new isolated neutron stars from within the _ rosat _",
    "all - sky survey bright source catalog ( bsc ; @xcite ) using short @xmath41000  s observations with nasa s _ swift _  satellite @xcite .",
    "although the scientific focus of the _ swift _  mission is on gamma - ray burst ( grb ) studies , its autonomous pointing capability , rapid one degree per second slewing , and joint  + uv / optical instrumentation make it an excellent platform for such large - scale surveys @xcite , as well as for generic targets of opportunity ( toos ) .",
    "we select our targets for _ swift _  using statistical techniques of catalog cross - correlation @xcite , comparing sources from the bsc to the , iras point - source , and nvss catalogs , and selecting sources that are likely , on general grounds , to possess high @xmath5 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our candidate ins sources are then observed with _ swift _  on a time - available basis as `` fill - in targets , '' with a low priority that is guaranteed not to preempt grb and time - sensitive too observations .    before discussing the results of our survey",
    ", we note that the term `` isolated neutron star '' ( ins ) , although it appears generic , has in fact been adopted to refer exclusively to the seven known non - radio pulsar , non - magnetar , non supernova - remnant associated neutron stars .",
    "since we will be selecting targets on the basis of a high  to optical flux ratio , @xmath6 , which admits these several types of compact object into our sample , we find it necessary to define a more inclusive term : the `` isolated compact object '' or ico .",
    "the ico is an object demonstrated to have a sufficiently high @xmath6 that its nature as a compact object is assured , with the only remaining question being what type of compact object it is  and an ins being one such possibility .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the first ico ( and candidate ins ) to be identified from our survey , 1rxs  j141256.0 + 792204 . in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] , we present our suite of observations of this source , which demonstrate an  to optical flux ratio @xmath0 , sufficient to establish it as a compact object . given its unique set of properties , we re - christen the source calvera , and in  [ sec : discuss ] , discuss its properties in relation to known compact object classes .",
    "establishing a preferred interpretation , while challenging in the absence of further observations , proves to be a useful exercise , casting light on larger questions related to the nature of the known populations of isolated compact objects .",

    "we observed the bright source catalog source 1rxs  j141256.0 + 792204  with the _",
    "swift_satellite beginning at 01:25 ut on 25  august 2006 . the single observation , extending over two satellite orbits , yielded 1.9  ksec of simultaneous exposure with the satellite s  telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) and ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) instruments .",
    "uvot observations were taken exclusively through the uvm2 filter , with filter transmission peaking at 220  nm , and xrt observations were in photon counting mode .",
    "we reduced the data using a custom pipeline derived from official mission data analysis tools ( heasoft , v6.2 ) and ciao v3.4 @xcite , with xrt event grades 012 accepted for analysis .",
    "the _ swift _  xrt data recover the bright  source 1rxs  j141256.0 + 792204 , allow an improved estimate of the source position , and provide a broadband  spectrum .",
    "the x - ray source position and its statistical uncertainty were derived using wavdetect .",
    "we extracted 81 source counts from within 30  of the best position , and 51 background counts from a 3.3  radius circle centered 7.3  from the source position .",
    "the expected number of background counts in the source region is 1.20.2 , which we neglect in the forgoing analysis .",
    "this  spectrum ( table  [ tab : props ] ) was fit using the standard products response matrix swxpc0to12_20010101v008.rmf and an ancillary response matrix produced using the ftools task xrtmkarf , in xspec v12.3.0 @xcite . the column density ( )",
    "is held fixed at the galactic value @xcite , because the small number of counts do not permit a strong constraint on ; also ,  is sufficiently low ( 3 cm ) that either doubling  or setting = 0 cm result in an effective temperature ( ) within the best fit 90% confidence statistical uncertainty .",
    "we first attempted to bin the spectrum into four spectral bins , corresponding to energy ranges 0.3 - 1.0 , 1.0 - 2.0 , 2.0 - 5.0 and 5.0 - 10 kev , which contain 44 , 28 , 2 and 0 counts , respectively .",
    "the number of counts in these bins is so low , that for two such bins , the usual assumption for @xmath7 statistics , that the error bars can be approximated as gaussian , does not hold ; thus , with two spectral bins where this assumption does hold ( with number of counts @xmath815 ) and two spectral parameters to be fit , the observed x - ray spectrum has too low of signal - to - noise ratio to exclude a blackbody spectral model ( or any other @xmath92 parameter model ) .",
    "however , we can derive maximumum likelihood spectral parameters , and their uncertainties ; a statistic which is better for doing so when the number of x - ray counts is low is the cash statistic @xcite , which we use to derive the maximum likelihood parameter values and their uncertainties .",
    "the inss are all well - described by thermal ( blackbody ) spectral models .",
    "the best - fit blackbody model for calvera  gives = 21525 ev , and = 7.3 km ( d/10 ) ( uncertainties given are 90% confidence ) .",
    "alternatively , the best - fit photon power - law slope is 2.80.3 ; a thermal bremsstrahlung model has best - fit @xmath10 , and the best - fit raymond - smith plasma has a temperature @xmath11 kev .",

    "s.    the high  to uv flux ratio established by the _",
    "swift_observations , combined with limits on the brightness of any optical ( dss ) or near - infrared ( 2mass ) counterparts from archival surveys , led us to pursue director s discretionary time observations with the gemini telescope .",
    "our subsequent gemini north + gemini multiobject spectrograph ( gmos - n ) observations were taken in queue - observing mode as @xmath13s images with mean epoch 14:46  ut on 22 dec 2006 .",
    "data were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , fringe - subtracted , registered , and combined with cosmic - ray rejection using gemini pipeline software and official calibration products ; the photometric zero - point was derived by reference to ten unsaturated catalog stars in the image .",
    "our resulting image of the region of sky around the source reveals three potential optical counterparts ( a  c ) with @xmath14-band magnitudes of @xmath15 mag , @xmath16 mag , and @xmath17 mag , respectively , where the uncertainties in the final significant digits are given in parentheses .",
    "these sources are at j2000 coordinates @xmath18 , @xmath19 ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 ; and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , respectively , and can be seen in fig .  [ fig : cxogem ] , which shows our final image , smoothed with a psf - like gaussian kernel of fwhm 1.2  to reveal faint sources .    in order to eliminate the possibility of associating 1rxs  j141256.0 + 792204  with these faint optical sources , we obtained a 2.1@xmath24ksec ddt observation with the _ chandra_/hrc - i @xcite . a wide - field ( imaging ) observing mode , which has degraded fast - timing capabilities ,",
    "was selected to include within the field - of - view an unrelated  point source ( swift  j141055.1 + 791309 ; @xmath25 10  from calvera ) , also detected in our _ swift _  xrt observation .",
    "we detected 190 counts within 2  of the best - fit position for calvera , where only 0.3880.004 are expected due to background .",
    "our ` wavdetect ` analysis reveals just one other faint  source , , at 2  off - axis .",
    "this source lies within the field of view ( fov ) of our gemini observations , and can be associated with a bright point - like optical source in this image .",
    "it thus offers the opportunity to make a direct registration of the _ chandra _  and gemini observations .",
    "we calculate our best estimates for the _ chandra _  positions of calvera  and  using an iterative , weighted - centroiding algorithm that weights photon positions according to a gaussian approximation of the psf , which we find to be a superior approach to standard unweighted centroid analyses .",
    "uncertainties in the resulting positions are determined by bootstrap monte carlo analysis : in each of 10,000 trials , we resample all detected photons within a large window around the target object , drawing with replacement , and then executing our centroiding algorithm in full , saving all resulting positions .",
    "our quoted 90%-confidence radius corresponds to the minimum - radius circle enclosing 90% of the resulting monte carlo positions .",
    "we find a _",

    "+ 79:19:58.95 ( j2000 ) .",
    "we prefer to quote positions from the gemini astrometry , which is registered to the catalog astrometry with precision 0.14  precision ( rms ) , and note that since our final aim is to position calvera  on the gemini image , any overall error in the gemini astrometry has no impact in this context . within 2  of the best - fit position , we find 8 source counts .",
    "was not detected in the swift observation , as its flux ( 5 s , assuming 1 hrc count = 1.3 erg cm , for photon powerlaw slope 2.0 and =3 cm ) was below the detection limit for the swift observation .",
    "the registration of  results in an offset of 0.04west , 0.95  north ( @xmath250.95  total ) to _ chandra_coordinate positions , yielding the position for calvera  that we quote in table  [ tab : props ] : r.a .",
    "14:12:55.885 , dec .  + 79:22:04.10 ( j2000 ) , with a 90%-confidence uncertainty of 0.57  that incorporates the centroiding uncertainty for calvera  as well as , conservatively , the 0.14  precision of the gemini astrometric mapping .",
    "there are 533 usno - b1.0 objects with @xmath26 within 10  of ; the probability of one lying @xmath270.95  from the _ chandra _  position is 1.3 , which we regard as sufficient to demonstrate the _ chandra _  source is associated with the gemini source .",
    "finally , we note that our @xmath28 arcsec offset from the _ chandra _  native astrometry is anomalous according to the mission operations team , with 0.6  radial uncertainty at 90%-confidence being the expected performance .",
    "however , following our observations the chandra  center reported discovery of a 0.5  systematic offset in acis observations taken after december 2006 , attributed to an altered spacecraft thermal environment , which may be relevant in this context .",
    "figure  [ fig : cxogem ] displays the  localization for 1rxs  j141256.0 + 792204  in the context of our gemini @xmath14-band image . the nearest point source ( `` a '' ) , southeast of the _ chandra _  localization , has @xmath29mag and is excluded as a counterpart with @xmath30 confidence .",
    "we therefore detect no @xmath14-band counterpart to a 3@xmath1 limit of @xmath31mag , or @xmath32@xmath33jy at 4750 .",
    "the expected extinction is @xmath34mag towards the source , as estimated from galactic extinction maps as well as the source s  spectrum .",
    "as the @xmath14 and @xmath35-band zero points are the same , we find an extinction - corrected  to optical flux ratio of @xmath36 for 1rxs  j141256.0 + 792204 .",
    "a power density spectrum finds no evidence for periodicity at any frequency between 4.66 and 1024  hz with weak limits on % root - mean - squared variability of @xmath2741% , high compared with detected periodicities from known inss @xcite .",
    "the total observed hrc - i average countrate is 52 c / s ; the nature of the hrc - i wiring error is such that the absolute timing uncertainty is @xmath4 0.02 sec .",
    "thus , while it is outside the scope of this paper to fully address the sensitivity of observations with degraded timing capabilities to a periodic signal , the @xmath2741% r.m.s .",
    "variability limit will apply to periodicities in the range @xmath40.001 - 50 hz , but not to higher frequency periodicities .    comparing the spatial distribution of events in the hrc - i focal plane to the distribution expected for a point source with the spectrum of 1rxs  j141256.0 + 792204 , using an 85,000-photon chart simulation @xcite , indicates that the source remains unresolved at sub - arcsecond _ chandra _  resolution .",
    "our 90%-confidence upper limits on the fractional contribution from any resolved component are @xmath2716% for a resolved component with gaussian fwhm of 1  arcsec , and @xmath2710% for a resolved component with gaussian fwhm @xmath37 5  arcsec .",
    "the  to optical flux ratio of 1rxs  j141256.0 + 792204 , @xmath0 , is comparable to published limits that have accompanied the discovery of several inss : 1rxs  j185635.1@xmath38375433  ( @xmath87000 , @xcite ) , rx  j1605.3 + 3249 ( @xmath9 , @xcite ) , 1rxs  j130848.6 + 212708 ( @xmath812000 , @xcite ) , and 1rxs j214303.7 + 065419 ( @xmath8 , @xcite ) . in all cases the extreme value of",
    "was used to exclude all non - compact object source classes .",
    "indeed , all these sources have subsequently been confirmed as inss , and no counterexamples  sources identified as icos on the basis of  and subsequently demonstrated not to be compact objects  exist in the literature .",
    "the fact that high , sometimes coupled with detection of x - ray pulsations , is used to identify inss @xcite , and that none has yet been shown to be another class of source , argues for the robustness of this approach .",
    "we conclude that 1rxs  j141256.0 + 792204  is a new ico and candidate ins , for which we adopt the name `` calvera . ''    with neither a direct distance measurement nor a proposed association for calvera , however  and without high signal - to - noise spectroscopy to confront emission models",
    " our discussion of the physical properties of the source must begin by exploring the range of possible emission models , accepting that both the spectral form and emitting area are largely unconstrained at present .",
    "we will therefore discuss each possible model for calvera  in turn : isolated neutron star , magnetar , compact central object , or radio pulsar .      in this section",
    ", we consider four possible compact object classifications . in doing so",
    ", it will be useful to refer to two figures . in figures  [ fig : compare ] and [ fig : compare2 ] we compare the x - ray luminosities , thermal blackbody radii ( ) and effective temperatures ( ) for four classes of compact objects  inss , magnetars , msps and ccos  with calvera . here ,",
    "the luminosities for the ccos ( pup a , @xcite ; g266.1 - 1.2 , @xcite ; cas a , @xcite ; g330.2 + 1.0 , @xcite ) and inss ( from @xcite and references therein ) are the thermal bolometric luminosities .",
    "we use the bolometric thermal luminosities of the msps in 47  tuc @xcite as indicative of those in the field .",
    "magnetar luminosities @xcite are in the 210  kev band ( bolometric luminosities will be greater ) .    before attempting to classify calvera  within the context of these two figures , and their corresponding source populations",
    ", we make a general observation .",
    "the ccos , magnetars and inss are all thought to be thermally powered ( i.e. , due to core and crustal cooling , including effects of magnetic field decay ; @xcite ) .",
    "these classes occupy different areas of the ( , ) diagram . the youngest objects ( ccos , with the object in westerlund 1 being the notable exception ; * ?",
    "* ) are located in the lower right ( high , low ) , older objects ( magnetars ) are in the upper right ( high , high ) , and the oldest objects ( inss ) are in the upper - left ( low , high ) .",
    "this may suggest a population synthesis model in which individual objects evolve with time through the ( , ) diagram .",
    "although this is speculative  and we leave detailed consideration to future work  for our present purposes it is sufficient to point out that these three classes of sources , plus the msps of 47  tuc , occupy different areas of the ( , ) and ( , @xmath39 ) diagrams .",
    "the diagrams are therefore a useful means to compare the properties of calvera  to those of each class of compact object .    in the following sections , we compare calvera s properties with the typical source properties of known classes of compact objects which have been identified among field  sources .",
    "the alternative is that calvera  has unique properties  for example , an  or @xmath39 unlike those of previously identified classes , perhaps due to a different atmospheric composition , magnetic field configuration , or object size , which we call the `` it can be any size '' hypothesis ( icbas ) .",
    "the implication of the icbas hypothesis is that no statement about calvera s distance ( and thus luminosity or ) can be made .",
    "the icbas hypothesis can not be falsified in the absence of a distance measurement ; we therefore do not discuss it further .",
    "since the observational approach used to classify calvera  is identical to that of the observationally homogeneous class of inss ",
    "the so - called magnificent seven @xcite  one might expect that calvera  shares observational properties with this class . as we show in this section ,",
    "the properties of calvera  diverge from the known inss .    despite deep observations of the seven inss with _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _ , the emergent  spectra of objects in this class are not well understood .",
    "the spectrum of the brightest one , 1rxs  j185635.1@xmath38375433 , is accurately described by a blackbody in the  passband @xcite , but its optical emission , while also thermal , requires a second blackbody component with a lower temperature and larger emission area @xcite . the only proposed x - ray spectrum which is consistent with both x - ray and optical spectra",
    "is composed of an optically thin layer of magnetized hydrogen @xcite .",
    "other inss also display thermal spectra in the  passband .",
    "modeling the  spectra of all inss as thermal blackbodies of identical emission area ( = @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is source distance , @xmath42 is the 0.12.4 kev flux , b.c .",
    "is the bolometeric correction , @xmath1 is the stefan - boltzman constant ) , we normalize the ins distances to the parallax distance @xmath43 for 1rxs  j185635.1@xmath38375433  @xcite , while noting that this recent result is larger than previous derived distances @xcite .",
    "the resulting inferred luminosities and three - dimensional locations of the seven known inss , and calvera , are given in table  [ tab : dist ] , and displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] .",
    "while our approach assumes @xmath44 is identical for all inss , this assumption may not be correct : e.g. , compare the range of  values measured for various magnetars ( @xcite ; 210 km  a factor of 5 ) .",
    "it nonetheless is consistent with the newly - measured parallax distance for the ins rx  j0720.4@xmath3831225 to the level of accuracy required for the present comparison ( parallax distance @xmath45pc and blackbody distance @xmath46pc ; @xcite ) .    calculated in this way , all but one previously - known ins have distances from the midplane of the galactic disk @xmath47 ( the exception is 1rxsj  130848.6 + 212708 , @xmath48 ) . under the same interpretation calvera s distance is @xmath49 from the sun , and @xmath50 from the plane of the disk , with galactocentric distance @xmath51 , placing it firmly out of the disk and in the galactic halo .",
    "no other isolated neutron stars are known in the halo , although it seems likely that at least some radio pulsars  whose distance estimates make use of the free electron density of the ism , dominated by the disk component  populate the halo @xcite .",
    "the inferred luminosity of calvera  is then @xmath52 ( 0.12.4 kev ) = 1.0 s an order of magnitude greater than the next most - luminous ins ( fig .  [ fig : compare ] ) , due to the high  of calvera .",
    "this location leads to a conundrum . the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the halo is too sparse to power calvera s  luminosity by accretion .",
    "if the source is then powered by remnant heat from the supernova which produced it , then standard cooling curves require a cooling age @xmath53 old @xcite during which time it must travel at velocity perpendicular to the plane @xmath54 a distance of at least @xmath55 ; its distance from the plane then requires @xmath56 , greater than has been previously observed for any ns . alternatively if the ins is travelling at a more usual @xmath57 @xcite , that requires a cooling time of @xmath58myr , which can not be accommodated by either cooling of standard nss @xcite or of highly magnetized ones @xcite .",
    "thus , the ins hypothesis for calvera  leads to conclusions which challenge existing theory .",
    "while high proper - motion is sometimes used to demonstrate proximity of an astronomical object , one can not exclude the distant , standard - cooling ins hypothesis with a high proper - motion measurement in this case .",
    "this is because a more distant ins ( out in the halo ) requires a proportionately greater @xmath59 .",
    "the projection of this velocity across the line of sight results in a distance - independent proper motion @xmath60 ; for calvera , this is @xmath61 for @xmath62= yr , independent of calvera s distance .",
    "while the observation of a slow pulse period , @xmath63s , and a rapid spin - down rate ( for an axp identification ) , or alternatively a burst of gamma - rays ( for an sgr identification ) , would be required to demonstrate a magnetar nature for calvera , neither possibility can be ruled out with the current set of observations .",
    "we thus consider the hypothesis that calvera  is a magnetar .",
    "recent work has identified a tight clustering of the maximum persistent 210 kev  luminosities of magnetars near @xmath41.3 s   making them , in a sense ,  standard candles @xcite .",
    "magnetar  spectra ( 0.110 kev ) can be described by a soft blackbody ( @xmath640.63  kev ) with a power - law dominating at higher energies ( power - law photon index @xmath654.5 ) .",
    "while the low signal to noise of our _ swift _  xrt spectrum of calvera  does not allow demonstration of multiple spectral components , a single power - law fit across 0.510 kev is expected to overestimate the 210 kev flux , and hence underestimate the source distance according to this relation . our best - fit single power - law flux ( table  [ tab : props ] ) , assuming the standard - candle luminosity derived by @xcite for calvera , yields a distance @xmath66 , and a height above the galactic disk of @xmath67",
    "this would imply an even more extreme space velocity / lifetime ( large @xmath68 ) conundrum than the ins hypothesis considered above .    alternatively ,",
    "if ( contrary to current evidence ) we consider the 210 kev luminosity of magnetars to be a free parameter , then we note that known magnetars @xcite are all located within @xmath69kpc of the galactic plane . placing calvera  at @xmath70kpc ,",
    "then , yields a distance of @xmath71 and a 210 kev  luminosity @xmath728.7s , a factor of @xmath73 times less luminous than the standard - candle luminosity @xcite and @xmath74 times less luminous than the next - faintest known magnetar @xcite .",
    "calvera , if it is a magnetar , is thus observationally distinguished from all other known magnetars , having either an anomalously small luminosity or an anomalously large galactic altitude .",
    "we thus consider the magnetar hypothesis strongly disfavored .",
    "the compact central object ( cco ) of cas  a @xcite is one of several point - like  sources in the centers of galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) that have similar spectral properties @xcite .",
    "the cas  a cco is observed with = @xmath75 and emission radius @xmath76 km at the distance of cas  a , @xmath77kpc .",
    "it is unclear why ccos have apparently smaller  than magnetars and inss .",
    "the small blackbody radii of the cco sources are inconsistent , in all current theoretical scenarios , with uniform emission from the full surface of a neutron star .",
    "a small radius would be expected if these sources emit the majority of their radiation from hot polar caps covering a fraction of the ns surface ; however , the absence of detected pulsations from the ccos ( with the exception of rx  j121000.8@xmath38522625 ) casts some doubt on this interpretation . as an alternative",
    ", it has been suggested that the ccos may be accreting black holes .    while the unique class - defining characteristic of a cco is association with a snr , and there is no known snr within 2 deg of calvera , we may consider the possibility that calvera  is the first `` unhosted '' cco .",
    "if we assume a three - dimensional space velocity for calvera  equal to the @xmath78 average for radio pulsars @xcite , and an age appropriate to the cooling age for a k ns , @xmath79yr @xcite , then we expect calvera  to have traveled 190  pc from its birthplace .",
    "travelling at a statistical - average angle of @xmath80 with respect to the disk , it would be expected to traverse a vertical distance @xmath81pc out of the galactic plane . adding this distance to the stellar scale height of the galactic disk , @xmath82pc",
    ", we expect it to have reached @xmath83pc by the time it has cooled to its present temperature .",
    "this would then yield a distance @xmath84pc , an emitting radius @xmath85 km , and a luminosity @xmath86 ( 0.12.4 kev ) . this would make calvera  a factor of @xmath2510 fainter than the faintest known cco , while giving it a comparable temperature and emitting radius .",
    "such a distance is within reach of a parallax measurement with present instruments @xcite .",
    "we compare the  properties of calvera  to msps observed in the homogeneous survey of the msp population of 47  tuc @xcite .",
    "calvera  has a similar effective temperature as these msps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : compare2 ] ) ; and , for distances between 80 and 260 pc , it has a similar thermal bolometric luminosity ( s ; fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] ) and  ( 0.06 - 0.18 km ) .",
    "the @xmath2741% r.m.s variability limit is consistent with variability limits on these msps @xcite .",
    "thus , the measured properties of calvera  are consistent with those of an msp with a distance between 80 and 260 pc .",
    "intriguingly , one radio pulsar has previously been discovered from a similar -selected sample @xcite .",
    "if calvera  is a radio pulsar , then , it would not be unprecedented .",
    "we have identified a new isolated compact object at high galactic latitude ( @xmath87 ) , calvera , via its high  to optical flux ratio , @xmath88 .",
    "if calvera  is a typical ins , it would have a distance @xmath89 which would require a spatial velocity @xmath90 to reach this location in less than a cooling time @xmath91 .",
    "this velocity is much greater than the @xmath92 value typical to pulsars , and even much greater than the highest directly measured velocity for a neutron star ( 1083 , * ? ? ? * ) or the highest implied velocity ( 800 - 1600 , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively within the typical ins hypothesis , it would have cooling time ( @xmath93 ) much longer than present cooling - time predictions .",
    "if calvera  is a typical magnetar , its distance would be even greater than in the ins hypothesis , and therefore velocity and cooling - time implications are more disparate from the present observations and theory .",

    "we therefore conclude that calvera  is most likely a radio pulsar .",

    "it would be the closest msp in the northern hemisphere ( followed by psr  j0030 + 0451 , d=300 pc ) making it a potentially useful target both for a pulsar timing array @xcite and for targeted search with the _ laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory _",
