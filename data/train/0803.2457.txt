    "conventional superconductors in their superconducting state are characterized by opening of the superconducting gap ( sg ) in the electronic density of states ( dos ) .",
    "superconductivity appears when electrons bind into cooper pairs and condense with long - range order below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 .",
    "cuprate superconductors , however , as one of the most intriguing characteristics in their normal state , show the unusual emergence of the pseudogap ( pg ) in the electronic excitation spectrum even above @xmath2 , which persists up to a temperature @xmath3 , the pg onset temperature .",
    "it has been widely accepted that understanding the pg origin and the relation between the pg and the sg may lead to a key to finding the basic mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity,@xcite which is not fully resolved up to the present .",
    "there are two schools of thought as to understanding the pg in the cuprate physics : one - gap and two - gap ones .",
    "one - gap school regards the pg as the precursor of the sg , where thermal fluctuations destroy long - range order while maintaining gap - like features in the excitation spectra in a certain high - temperature range ( @xmath4 ) of the normal state .",
    "thus , the pg in question is believed to bring about the partial depletion of the dos at the normal - state fermi surface@xcite , resulting in the fermi arcs.@xcite the other school interprets the pg , especially in the underdoped regime , in terms of two gaps ; a small sg revealed in the nodal regions and a large gap of different origin in the antinodal regions . in the two - gap model , the fermi arcs are believed to emerge due to long - range order that , however , is not associated with the superconducting order . above @xmath2",
    "the sg may vanish , leaving the other long - range order connected to the fermi arcs , fermi surface nestings@xcite or fermi surface pockets@xcite .",

    "this experimental observation from ijjs is claimed to provide the norm of two gaps , where the sg and the pg are considered to be of different origins.@xcite the interlayer tunneling reveals the intrinsic bulk tunneling properties between cuo@xmath0 superconducting layers , which can be an advantage of this scheme compared to other surface - sensitive spectroscopic methods .",
    "recently , however , it has been suggested that the experimental observations of the ijjs could be affected by the self - heating generated in a high - bias region , which was caused by the poor thermal conductivity of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath8 ( bi-2212 ) and other materials involved in the tunneling measurements.@xcite    the zero - bias tunneling process in the @xmath9 axis is very sensitive to the electronic dos at the normal - state fermi surface . in particular ,",
    "the zero - bias tunneling resistance @xmath10 in the bi-2212 is weighted by the tunneling of quasiparticles in the antinodal region of the fermi surface.@xcite thus , @xmath10 is expected to increase rapidly as the pg opens and the corresponding dos is partially depleted at the fermi surface . in this point of view , the onset temperature of the pg opening can be defined as the characteristic temperature @xmath11 , at which @xmath10 deviates from the @xmath12-linear temperature dependence in @xmath10 vs @xmath12 curves.@xcite    recently , kawakami _",
    "et al._,@xcite based on the temperature dependence of @xmath10 , have shown that both the electron- and the hole - doped cuprates have common spin - singlet correlations in forming the pg , both of which thus close in high magnetic fields .",
    "the closing fields of the pg and the sg , however , show much different temperature dependencies from each other , which indicates that the two gaps are of separate origins .",
    "difference in origins of the two gaps is in line with the coexistence of the superconducting state and the pg state observed by the interlayer tunneling spectroscopy ( its ) in hole - doped bi-2212 ijjs , which is represented by the sharp peak and the broad hump structure below @xmath2.@xcite relating the hump structure in the high - energy windows of the its to the formation of the pg was controversial up to the present , however , again because of possible self - heating in a high - bias region,@xcite although there have been many efforts to reduce the self - heating effect in the its , by adopting schemes such as reducing the junction area , reducing the number of stacked junctions , and adopting pulsed biasing.@xcite    in this study , for an overdoped bi-2212 sample fabricated on an as - grown single crystal , we discriminate the pg onset temperature , defined by the appearance of the hump structure ( @xmath13 ) in the its while lowering temperature , from that obtained by the @xmath10 vs @xmath12 behavior ( @xmath11 ) . to obtain the interlayer tunneling characteristics that are essentially free from self - heating artifact",
    ", we adopted the recently developed technique of heating - compensated its , where a large portion of the bias - induced self - heating was removed.@xcite in contrast to @xmath11@xmath14 190 k , the hump structure persisted up to temperatures much higher than commonly perceived .",
    "we then numerically illustrate that , with significant self - heating , @xmath13 would reduce down to @xmath11 , which confirms the previous reports by others in the heating - dominated case.@xcite we thus suggest that the @xmath13 represents the genuine onset of the pg . as in earlier works@xcite , with decreasing temperature below @xmath2 , the hump voltages in our heating - free its increases , along with the increase of the superconducting gap size .",
    "it turns out that this unusual temperature variation of the hump voltage below @xmath2 results from the combined tunneling contribution of the quasiprticles associated with both the sg and the pg in the electronic state .",
    "since the antinodal tunneling is weighted , the behavior of this pg obtained in the its of our overdoped bi-2212 should be related to the electronic structure of the antinodal region in the first brillouin zone of the cuo@xmath0 layers .",

    "the temperature variation of the sample stack during its measurements was monitored _ in - situ _ by the change in the tunneling resistance of the thermometer stack taken in a constant bias current@xcite of @xmath21 @xmath16a . to maintain the thermometer stack at a given set temperature during its measurements we compensated the bias - induced heating by lowering the current level to the heater coil wound on the copper substrate holder block .",
    "we repeated this heating - compensation scheme by using a computer - aided proportional - integral - derivative control of the thermometer stack incorporated with adjusting the heating - current level . by adopting this technique",
    "we were able to maintain the temperature of the thermometer stack within about 0.2 k in the whole bias range of the its.@xcite however , there could still be a temperature difference , @xmath22 , between the sample stack and the thermometer stack due to the finite thermal conductance of the bottom au electrode , through which the heat generated in the sample stack flowed to the thermometer stack , and due to the thermal leakage of heating to the surroundings.@xcite    we numerically estimated the temperature difference @xmath22 between the sample stack and the thermometer stack during its measurements .",
    "the comsol multiphysics program was used to calculate the temperature profile in the sample.@xcite in the estimation , we referred to the geometry and arrangement of the sample used in the measurement [ fig .",
    "namely , the common bottom au electrode was attached to the sapphire substrate ( 0.4 mm thick and 5@xmath155 mm@xmath17 in the lateral size ) using negative photoresist , which in turn was fixed on the heater - coil - wound copper block using ge varnish ( assumed to be about 1 @xmath16 m thick ) .",
    "the top au electrodes in the sample and thermometer stacks were extended by up to 200 @xmath16 m by two ( 300-nm - thick and 3-@xmath16m - wide ) au stripes ( per each stack ) deposited on the substrate that was precoated with an about 1-@xmath16m - thick negative photoresist layer .",
    "the end of each au extension was then connected to a gauge-@xmath2340 copper wire that was thermally anchored at the base copper - block temperature .",

    "1(b ) shows the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivities of au and bi-2212 along the @xmath9 axis,@xcite which played a crucial role in the heat flow through the sample .",
    "the in - plane thermal conductivity of bi-2212 was assumed to be ten times higher than the @xmath9-axis thermal conductivity.@xcite the thermal conductivities for sapphire , negative photoresist , and ge varnish were assumed to be insensitive to the temperature variation and set to be 40 , 0.2 , and 0.2 w / m - k , respectively .",
    "the heat generated at the sample stack was dissipated through both the top and bottom thermal channels , while the temperature of the thermometer stack was maintained at a fixed temperature during the heating - compensated its .",
    "1(b ) shows the discrepancy of temperature between the the sample stack and the thermometer stack as a function of the copper - block base temperature , corresponding to the heating power at the sample stack of 0.27 , 0.70 , and 1.35 mw .",
    "one notices that @xmath22 is governed by the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of the bottom au electrode : @xmath22 increases in the temperature range of 20 - 80 k because of reduction of the au thermal conductivity until it saturates at temperatures above 100 k. the heating power of 0.70 mw corresponds to the bias voltage that is high enough to observe the hump structure in the differential conductance in the inset of fig . 2 ( @xmath24=525 mv ) and in figs . 4 and 5(a )",
    "( @xmath25=@xmath24/19=27.6 mv ) .",

    "the fermi nesting near the antinodal region is reduced with increasing the doping in hole - doped cuprates because of change of the fermi surface topology with doping.@xcite the angle - integrated photoemission spectroscopy also showed that the binding energy of the pg corresponding to the flat - band position of the antinodal region , the so - called high - energy pseudogap , decreases with increasing doping.@xcite thus , one can expect that the pg energy scale and the pg onset temperature will decrease with increasing doping if the pg in the its is associated with the antinodal electronic state .",
    "indeed , it has been reported that the pg onset temperature @xmath11 and the pg closing field @xmath66 observed in @xmath10 vs @xmath12 decrease with increasing doping.@xcite    the low - energy pseudogap is believed to be a precursor of the superconducting state , while the high - energy pseudogap ( hepg ) is inferred to be of an antiferromagnetic order or orders like the spin - density wave and the charge - density wave . in the hole - doped cuprates",
    ", the low - energy pseudogap tends to close near the optimal doping but the hepg persists even in the heavily overdoped regime .",
    "features of the hepg related to the antinodal region have been observed in various experiments such as the electronic magnetic susceptibility,@xcite the knight shift,@xcite and the angle - integrated photoemission spectroscopy.@xcite the onset temperatures of the hepg over the doping values in these measurements were almost twice as high as those of the low - energy pseudogap .",
    "especially , the onset temperatures of the hepg for @xmath19@xmath140.19 were 260@xmath14270 k , close to our its results at the same doping value .",
    "since the interlayer tunneling spectra mainly reveal the electronic state in the vicinity of the antinodal region the formation of the pseudogap is closely related to the electronic state in this region .",
    "it has been widely accepted that the antinodal regions in cuprates are related to the formation of an antiferromagnetic order or orders like the spin - density wave and the charge - density wave .",
    "it thus strongly indicates that our hump structure is highly likely to be related to the hepg .",
    "in order to understand the nature of the pg , the interlayer tunneling spectroscopic characteristics of high-@xmath2 superconductors were investigated , while the self - heating was largely excluded using the heating - compensation technique incorporated with the _ in - situ _ thermometry . since the its is sensitive to the bias - induced self - heating an extreme care",
    "should be taken , as in this study , to keep the sample temperature constant within a tolerance limit over the whole bias sweeping range .",
    "but , as demonstrated by krasnov _",
    "et al._,@xcite most of the essential observations on the pg feature remain valid even in the earlier its results .",
    "thus , its , with a precautious measure taken to eliminate the self - heating , should provide a very useful experimental tools to investigate the electronic excitation spectrum of highly anisotropic materials containing naturally grown tunneling junctions .    in this study",
    ", it is found that the genuine pg behavior in the overdoped cuprates reveals the following characteristics .",
    "defined by the appearance of the hump at @xmath13 in the differential tunneling conductance , the pg onset temperature @xmath3 reaches up to nearly room temperature , much higher than the estimation based on the tunneling resistive transition , @xmath11 . with significant self - heating",
    ", however , numerical simulation shows that @xmath13 returns to @xmath11 .",
    "this observation indicates that the hump structure in the tunneling differential conductance provides far more accurate determination of the pg onset temperature than the tunneling resistive transition . the hump voltage revealed in the its below @xmath2",
    "is shown to follow the sg value , which is , in fact , additional confirmation that the hump structure in the its represents a genuine electronic pg state .",
    "the hump structure in the its below @xmath2 is also affected by the relative height and the voltage of the superconducting coherence peak , which originates from the fact that tunneling quasiparticles in an ijj are dressed by the presence of both the sg and the pg .",
    "since the interlayer tunneling is sensitive to the electronic state in antinodal region existing in a flat band the pg behavior in its , coexisting with the sg , should be related to the fermi surface nesting induced by the van hove singularity.@xcite",
