    "investigations of cosmic gamma - radiation of high energy ( 50 mev  5 gev ) , carried out with special space stations cos - b ( esa ) , gro - compton ( nasa ) , gamma ( roskosmos ) in 19802000 , discovered large amount of discrete sources of gamma - quanta of both galactic and extragalactic origin .",
    "identification of gamma - ray sources with known objects ( in radio , optic and other spectral ranges ) is of great interest , since knowledge of optical , radio counterparts allows to ascertain the nature and the processes of generation of gamma - radiation .",
    "significant part of gamma - ray sources are identified as yet . in galaxy , these are young pulsars ( neutron stars ) and close binary star systems . amongst extragalactic gamma - ray sources ,",
    "these are near quasars , active galactic nuclei , blazars ( variable objects with jets ) .",
    "investigation of identified gamma - ray sources are very important for astrophysics of high energy . but unidentified gamma - ray sources ( ugs ) , which are still not related to any known astrophysical objects , are likely to be of greater interest",
    ". they can make up a new class of active objects with a big energy release .",
    "the search for their counterparts in different spectral ranges can make clear their nature .    in the current paper an attempt to connect ugs of high energy ( @xmath1 mev ) with the regions of star formation ( rsf ) in our galaxy has been undertaken .",
    "for our purposes , data on coordinates and spectra were taken from catalogue @xcite , in which data were obtained at the space station gamma - telescopes during last years ( cos - b , egret ( station gro - compton ) ) .",
    "accuracy of the source coordinates , defined by tracks of @xmath2-pairs in spark chambers , was @xmath3 for @xmath4 mev . when discrete source is extracted from diffuse background , the error of source coordinate measurement",
    "was defined by statistics of the extracted gamma - quanta @xmath5 , being , in essence , an error of a mean @xmath6 .",
    "angular resolution of gamma - telescopes was defined on the base of both calculations and their calibrating with beam of tagged gamma - quanta at accelerators . in the current work",
    ", we used in addition data on different expositions of the same source .",
    "it gave us additional information about coordinate accuracy taking into account the measuring errors in actual conditions of space experiment .",
    "comparison of ugs with rsf was carried out using the most complete and suitable catalogue of v.s .",
    "avedisova @xcite .",
    "this catalogue includes 3300 items of rfs and represents detailed data on their characteristics .",
    "in the work devoted to identifying of gamma - sources with wolf - rayet stars @xcite , we inferred that actual accuracy of ugs coordinates makes up @xmath7 . in the given work , ugs and rsf",
    "are considered to be coincident , if their angular coordinates hit into `` error circle '' with radius @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are differences of latitudes and longitudes of the objects being compared .",
    "thus , `` error circle '' had been diminished , and , respectively , number of accidental superpositions had decreased .",
    "analysis has shown , that the chosen magnitude of @xmath11 were optimal for statistical confidence of coincidences between ugs and rsf .      for the search for positional correlation between ugs and rsf ,",
    "a band along galactic equator was chosen with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where overwhelming number of rsf concentrates .",
    "in the pointed band of latitudes @xmath12 , there are @xmath14 ugss with energy @xmath15 mev , from them @xmath16 coincide in position with rsf : 12 are within @xmath17 , 7 are within @xmath18 .",
    "information about `` coincident '' ugs and rsf ( designation and galactic coordinates ) are given in the table .",
    ".data on coincident ugs and rsf [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     nevertheless , on the base of obtained results we made one supposition about possible nature of given gamma - ray sources .",
    "it can be connected with a dark matter concentrating in rsf , annihilation of which leads to the enhanced flux of gamma - rays of high energy .",
    "dark matter ( dm ) can be supposed to concentrate in regions of forming stars .",
    "one can pick out several mechanisms for such concentration .",
    "baryonic and nonbaryonic components of matter can form density inhomogeneity together ( either starting from the very beginning , or having merged subsequently ) . in this case",
    "baryons are situated inside a clump of dm . also , it is possible that baryonic matter , being contracted , `` draws together '' dm due to adiabatic mechanism of energy loss by dm in varying gravitation field of baryons .",
    "both mechanisms are likely to be most effective for large inhomogeneities ( with mass @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , density of dm should be enhanced owing to partial convergence of trajectories of dm particles to the attractive center created by baryons @xcite . besides of that",
    ", dm particles , going through baryonic matter , can `` get stuck '' in it and accumulate with time , efficiency of what is dependent from respective interaction properties . in reality , concentration of dm can come out from superposition of many mechanisms in different degree , where operation of one of them provides favourable conditions for another .",
    "annihilation rate of dm grows as its density squared , so annihilation source shows itself in region of highest density . amongst annihilation products , produced in the result of cascade of transitions and decays of particles , there can be gamma - quanta with energy of hundreds mev and above .",
    "spectrum in this case should distinguish oneself with greater hardness .",
    "the results of the undertaken search for coincidences of ugs with rsf in galaxy point out at relation between rsf and ugs of high energy .",
    "fraction of `` coincided '' ugs is big enough ( @xmath0% ) , what gives the reason to consider the carried out identification to be meaningful for clarification of ugs nature .",
    "however statistics of ugs and number of coincidences with rsf is insufficient for decisive conclusion .    before obtaining new observation data in forthcoming experiments ( glast ,",
    "agile , gala and other ) it is reasonable to carry out a detailed analysis of rsf , first of all with view of extraction of most massive and compact objects in the regions of star formation .",
    "comparison of them with unidentified gamma - ray sources can give then more definite results .",
    "authors are grateful to v.s .  avedisova for help in the work and analysis of results .",
    "the work is fulfilled in a framework of project of rosobrazovanie rnp2.2.2.2.8248 .",
