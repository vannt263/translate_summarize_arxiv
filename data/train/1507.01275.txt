    "it was the development of radio astronomy that led to the realisation that the majority of our galaxy , and hence the universe , is dominated by molecular processes .",
    "more than 150 molecules have been detected so far in the interstellar medium ( ism ) by direct observation of their spectra .",
    "carbon monosulphide ( cs ) is one of these molecules @xcite and is a diatomic of both atmospheric as well as astrophysical interest . in the earth",
    "s atmosphere , cs plays a role in the formation of aerosols , in particular carbonyl sulphide ( ocs ) in the troposphere @xcite .    in the solar system",
    "cs has been observed in comets @xcite and the collision of comet shoemaker - levy 9 @xcite led to its detection in the atmosphere of jupiter @xcite . astronomically the molecule has been observed in a variety of objects such as carbon - rich stars @xcite , star forming regions @xcite and dense interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "in fact cs is one of the most abundant sulphur - containing species in interstellar clouds @xcite with several isotopologues long detected outside the milky way @xcite .",
    "the numerous astronomical detections of cs and the importance of the molecule in our own atmosphere has motivated copious laboratory studies . experimentally the cs spectrum has been studied in wavelength regions ranging from the microwave to the ultraviolet ( uv ) .",
    "a pioneering study was carried out by @xcite whom discovered the main @xmath6 - @xmath7 transition in the visible .",
    "additional electronic transitions in the visible to near uv have been investigated by , for example , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite made the first measurements of rotational lines for the @xmath0c@xmath1s , @xmath0c@xmath2s , @xmath0c@xmath3s and @xmath5c@xmath1s isotopomers in the microwave region .",
    "transitions in this region have also been observed by , for example , @xcite",
    ". early work in the millimetre wave region began with measurements of rotational @xmath0c@xmath1s and @xmath0c@xmath3s lines by @xcite , later extended by @xcite who additionally observed @xmath5c@xmath1s .",
    "@xcite also presented a study of the millimetre spectrum of rarer isotopologues @xmath0c@xmath2s,@xmath0c@xmath4s , @xmath5c@xmath2s and @xmath5c@xmath3s .",
    "more recent work in the region has been carried out by @xcite ( @xmath0c@xmath1s , @xmath0c@xmath3s , @xmath0c@xmath2s , @xmath5c@xmath1s , @xmath0c@xmath4s , @xmath5c@xmath2s , @xmath5c@xmath3s ) , @xcite ( @xmath0c@xmath1s , @xmath0c@xmath3s ) and @xcite ( @xmath0c@xmath1s , @xmath0c@xmath3s , @xmath0c@xmath2s , @xmath5c@xmath1s ) .",
    "the first study in the infra - red region was performed by @xcite who measured the @xmath8 vibrational band of the main isotope while @xcite and @xcite measured several @xmath9 = 1 bands of @xmath0c@xmath1s , @xmath0c@xmath2s , @xmath0c@xmath3s and @xmath5c@xmath1s .",
    "the resulting molecular parameters were later refined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured many @xmath9 = 2 bands for vibrational levels up to @xmath10 = 8 while @xcite obtained high resolution measurements of the 1 - 0 band , and 2 - 1 band for the main isotope , of @xmath0c@xmath2s , @xmath0c@xmath3s and @xmath5c@xmath1s for @xmath11 up to 41 , 28 , 32 and 28 respectively .",

    "additionally they measured @xmath9 = 1 transitions of @xmath0c@xmath1s up to @xmath10 = 7 - 6 to a higher accuracy than @xcite .    using the vibration - rotation and pure rotation data on this molecule available to them , @xcite derived a spectroscopic potential energy curve ( pec ) that reproduced all the input experimental data within experimental error .",
    "this pec is the starting point for the current work .",
    "transition probabilities or einstein a coefficients have been provided by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter produced transition lists for rotational quantum numbers @xmath12 for @xmath13 , and vibrational @xmath14 , though only for the four most abundant isotopes ( @xmath0c@xmath1s , @xmath0c@xmath2s , @xmath0c@xmath3s and @xmath5c@xmath1s ) .",
    "line lists for all isotopologues of cs , including some rotation - vibration transitions , are available from cdms @xcite .",
    "these were constructed from experimental data obtained by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the only available experimental measurements of the dipole moment @xcite .",
    "the line lists are very accurate and recommended for use in radio astronomy , though are limited to @xmath15 and @xmath16 and hence temperatures , @xmath17 below about 500  k. the aim of this work is to produce comprehensive line lists for all stable isotopologues of cs suitable for modelling hot environments , such as carbon stars ( @xmath18 k ) .",
    "the exomol project aims to provide line lists on all the molecular transitions of importance in the atmospheres of planets @xcite .",
    "the exomol methology has already been applied to a number of diatomic molecules : beh , mgh and cah @xcite , sio @xcite , nacl and kcl @xcite , pn @xcite , alo @xcite and nah @xcite . in this paper , we present ro - vibrational transition lists and associated spectra for all stable isotopologues of cs .",
    "the line lists for all eight isotopologues of cs , which we have named jnk , were obtained by solving the schrdinger equation allowing for born - oppenheimer breakdown ( bob ) effects using the program level8.0 @xcite . in principle",
    "the calculations were initiated using the spectroscopic pec of @xcite . in practice , as described below , the pec was first expressed in a form compatible with level .",
    "the pec was then adapted to improve the results of calculations performed using level .",
    "after computation the line lists are improved by replacing calculated energies with experimentally derived energies , where available , and shifting the remaining energies to maintain level predicted energy level separations . a theoretical dipole moment curve ( dmc ) from @xcite was also employed .",
    "we did not generate a new pec for cs .",
    "a full set of potential parameters representing a very accurate pec is already available from @xcite .",
    "the authors employed data for four isotopomers ( @xmath0c@xmath1s , @xmath0c@xmath2s , @xmath0c@xmath3s and @xmath5c@xmath1s ) in a least - squares fit to a potential function in the born - oppenheimer approximation and bob functions to determine a pec valid for all isotopologues .",
    "they set the dissociation energy @xmath19 to 59300.0 @xmath20  and expressed their fitted potential @xmath21 as a morse potential with a variable @xmath22 : @xmath23\\right)^{2},\\ ] ] where : @xmath24 the isotopically invariant breakdown functions were modelled as : @xmath25 and @xmath26 while the @xmath11-dependent non - adiatbatic breakdown function was modelled as : @xmath27 where : @xmath28 such that @xmath29 .",
    "these were applied in the effective radial hamiltonian according to : @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , defined with the atomic masses and : @xmath32 the variable @xmath22 morse is not implemented in level8.0 .",
    "the coefficients from @xcite , given in column ii of table  [ tab : potpar ] , were hence used to generate turning points for a range of internuclear distances .",
    "the turning points were used directly in level .    employing the potential parameters of @xcite in this way we could not reproduce the vibrational energies to the spectroscopic accuracy achieved by @xcite . by applying small ` corrections ' to potential parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we were able to predict the ro - vibrational energies up to @xmath10 = 9 , and experimental frequencies , for @xmath0c@xmath1s and @xmath5c@xmath1s to within 0.02 @xmath20and 0.04 @xmath20  respectively ( see jnk columns in table  [ tab : epar ] and table  [ tab : freq ] ) . to give an example , the residual ( obs - calc ) for @xmath0c@xmath1s @xmath37 without the ` corrections ' was 0.027 @xmath20  and 0.007 @xmath20after correction .",
    "the term ` correction ' is used tentatively in this context as , although the modification of the potential parameters improved the present results , this is not an improvement on the variable @xmath22 morse presented by @xcite .",
    "the potential parameters used in this work are given as column iii of table  [ tab : potpar ] .",
    "to further improve our results we took advantage of the exomol format used to store the line list , see section 3 .",
    "put simply this is a states file containing level energies and a transitions file detailing allowed energy level couplings .",
    "the advantage of the format is it gives the option of replacing calculated energies with more refined or experimental energies such that , when the files are unpacked to produce the line list , more accurate line frequencies are computed , see @xcite for example .",
    "first we attempted to refine our ro - vibrational energies ( @xmath38 ) for all isotopologues using the vibrational ( @xmath11 = 0 , @xmath3920 ) energies given in @xcite ( @xmath40 ) and the formula : @xmath41 ro - vibrational energies for @xmath10 > 20 were shifted to maintain the energy level separations predicted by level according to : @xmath42 we could then reproduce the vibrational energies to the same spectroscopic accuracy achieved by @xcite , however not all the line frequency predictions improved ( see jnk - cox columns in table  [ tab : freq ] ) .",
    "this is likely due to the fact experimental data available to @xcite was limited to @xmath4341 and @xmath4328 while @xcite and @xcite assigned lines for @xmath11 up to 113 and 86 for @xmath0c@xmath1s and @xmath5c@xmath1s respectively .",
    "therefore we decided to determine experimental energies directly from frequencies measured by @xcite and @xcite using the measured active rotation - vibration energy levels ( marvel ) technique @xcite which involves inverting transition frequencies to extract experimental level energies .",
    "@xcite is the more accurate experimental study and thence energies extracted from these frequencies were used preferentially over those extracted from @xcite frequencies where possible .",
    "we extracted 733 energies in total for the main isotopologue and 341 energies for @xmath5c@xmath1s , see table  [ tab : extracted ] .",
    "@xmath0c@xmath1s and @xmath5c@xmath1s energies for the experimental ranges were replaced with experimentally derived energies .",
    "ro - vibrational energies for ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) outside the experimental ranges were shifted to maintain the energy level separations predicted by level according to the following equations . for @xmath10",
    "< @xmath44 and @xmath11 > @xmath45 : @xmath46 for @xmath10 > @xmath44",
    ": @xmath47    the experimental frequencies for @xmath0c@xmath1s and @xmath5c@xmath1s , by default , were reproduced almost exactly using this method .",
    "the largest residual is < 0.001 @xmath20 .",
    "hence the accuracy of these line lists should be equal to the experimental accuracies , which are expected to be 0.012 @xmath20and 0.01 @xmath20  for @xcite and @xcite respectively .    for @xmath0c@xmath2s and @xmath0c@xmath3s @xcite measured infra - red @xmath10 = 1  0 absorption frequencies at 0.004 @xmath20unapodized resolution .",
    "the coxon refined energies , see eqs .",
    "[ eq : cox1 ] and [ eq : cox2 ] , reproduce these frequencies to very high precision ( see table  [ tab : other1 ] ) , as would be expected considering they fitted to these frequencies .",
    "the coxon refined energies also represent an improvement on the unrefined jnk energies ( see table  [ tab : other1 ] ) , therefore we chose to employ them in our final line lists for these two isotopologues .",
    "for the remaining isotopologues , with the exception of @xmath5c@xmath4s which has not been observed experimentally , we have only measurements of rotational frequencies from @xcite to compare with .",
    "these are expected to have an accuracy of at least 0.00002 @xmath20 .",
    "as can been seen in table  [ tab : other2 ] the agreement is excellent . due to our methods ,",
    "unrefined jnk and coxon refined energies predict the same rotational frequencies .",
    "however , since the coxon refined energies improved ro - vibrational frequency predictions for other isotopologues , these are employed in our final line lists for the remaining four isotopologues .",
    "an overview of the energy level content of our final hybrid line lists is given in table  [ tab : hybrid ] .",
    "although we have used terms jnk , jnk - cox and jnk - exp in the text to refer to unrefined , coxon refined and experimentally substituted energies respectively , the final line lists as provided in supplementary data and on www.exomol.com are simply named jnk .",

    "there is generally good agreement ; however the intensities of five strongest lines are almost 50  %  larger in the theoretical spectrum which may be due to saturation effects in the measured spectrum .",
    "in the present work we have computed comprehensive line lists for all stable isotopologues of carbon monosulphide . we determined a pec using level and modified potential parameters from the literature .",
