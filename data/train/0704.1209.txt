    "several experiments have been done in recent years to understand the mechanism of complex fragment emission in low - energy ( e@xmath5 @xmath6 10 mev / nucleon ) light heavy - ion ( a@xmath7 + a@xmath8 @xmath6 60 ) reactions @xcite . the origin of these fragments extends from quasi - elastic ( qe)/ projectile breakup @xcite , deep - inelastic ( di ) transfer and orbiting @xcite , to fusion - fission ( ff ) @xcite processes ; and in some cases the structure of the nuclei has been found to play an important role . in",
    "most of the reactions studied , the observed fully energy - damped yields of the fragments have been successfully explained in terms of fusion - fission ( ff ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , the reactions involving @xmath9 - cluster nuclei ( e.g. , @xmath2ne + @xmath1c @xcite , @xmath10 mg + @xmath1c @xcite , @xmath11si + @xmath1c @xcite etc . ) deserved special attention , where the observations of large enhancement in yield and/or resonance - like excitation function in a few outgoing channels have been indicative of a competitive role played by the deep - inelastic orbiting mechanism @xcite . in the ff mechanism , a completely equilibrated compound nucleus ( cn )",
    "is formed , which decays into various exit channels .",
    "the decay probability is governed by the available phase space and barrier penetration probabilities for the respective decay channels .",
    "the process occurs in a similar time scale which is required for the complete relaxation of the entrance channel energy and angular momentum . on the other hand",
    ", deep inelastic orbiting may be described in terms of the formation of a long - lived , dinuclear molecular complex @xcite , which acts as a  door way to fusion \" , with a strong memory of the entrance channel . in this picture , the interacting ions are trapped in a more deformed configuration than that of the compound nucleus ( trapped in the pocket of the ion - ion interaction potential due to combined effects of coulomb and centrifugal barriers ) .",
    "both orbiting and fusion - fission processes occur on similar time scale .",
    "in addition to that , for the light heavy - ion systems , the shapes of the orbiting dinuclear complexes are quite similar to the saddle and scission shapes obtained in course of evolution of the ff process .",
    "therefore it is difficult to differentiate the signatures of the two processes .",
    "the enhancement of fully energy damped reaction yields in light systems was first observed in the study of @xmath2ne + @xmath1c inelastic scattering at backward angles @xcite , where large cross sections have been observed in inelastic scattering yields near 180@xmath4 .",
    "subsequently , orbiting was observed in @xmath11si + @xmath1c @xcite and @xmath10 mg + @xmath1c @xcite reactions .",
    "detailed study of @xmath11si + @xmath1c system revealed that , at lower bombarding energies , the excitation spectra for the @xmath1c fragments were dominated by single excitation and mutual excitations of the @xmath1c and @xmath11si fragments , whereas at higher bombarding energies , the dominant strength for all these channels shifted to higher excitation energies @xcite . for the higher bombarding energies ,",
    "the most probable q - values were found to be independent of detection angles and the resulting angular distributions were found to have d@xmath12/d@xmath13 like angular dependence  characteristic of a long - lived , orbiting , dinuclear complex .",
    "similar results have been obtained for @xmath2ne + @xmath1c system @xcite , where resonance - like behaviour was also found in the excitation functions for several outgoing channels , which was similar to the observation made for symmetric @xmath14o + @xmath14o system @xcite .",
    "enhancements of large angle , binary reaction yields have also been observed in somewhat heavier @xmath11si + @xmath11si , @xmath10 mg + @xmath10 mg systems @xcite , where significant non resonant background yield was observed at higher excitation energies .",
    "the general pattern which unfolds from these studies clearly suggests that the enhancements are manifestations of dynamics of damped nuclear reactions involving a large number of channels , rather than due to specific structure effect appearing only in a few select channels .",
    "the enhancement in elastic and inelastic channels may be explained in terms of a long lived dinuclear configuration that decays back to entrance channel due to weak absorption which inhibits the orbiting configuration from spreading into compound nuclear states .",
    "however , the enhancement in the elastic channel can be explained with the assumption of weak absorption of grazing partial waves only ; on the contrary , deep - inelastic orbiting phenomenon in general suggests weak absorption in the angular momentum window between the critical angular momentum of fusion , @xmath15 , and the reaction grazing angular momentum , @xmath16 . besides , substantial mass and charge transfer , due to the rapid mass equilibration in light systems ,",
    "would also occur during the evolution of the orbiting dinuclear complex .",
    "so , the rearrangement channels are also of interest in probing the dynamics of the orbiting process involving light nuclear systems .",
    "it is , therefore evident that , though some qualitative understanding about the phenomenon of deep - inelastic orbiting reaction , in general ( @xmath17 , correlation with number of open reaction channels @xcite , or , alternatively , to weak absorption ) has been arrived at , precise mechanism of the process is still unknown .",
    "the deep - inelastic orbiting process has been observed in several light @xmath9-like systems , for example , @xmath2ne + @xmath1c @xcite , @xmath10 mg + @xmath1c @xcite , @xmath11si + @xmath1c @xcite , @xmath11si + @xmath14o @xcite systems , where the number of open channels are small ( @xmath18 10 ) @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath14o ( 116 mev ) + @xmath11si reaction @xcite showed different behaviour so far as the shape of the energy distributions , variation of @xmath19 values with angle , and yields of the fragments are concerned . for a better understanding of the orbiting process , it is interesting to study how the orbiting process evolves with energy",
    ". intuitively , survival of long lived dinuclear configuration other than fused composite is less probable at higher excitations and there are also indications that entrance channel effect becomes smaller at higher energies @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite made detailed study of @xmath2ne + @xmath1c system in the energy range e@xmath5 = 54  81 mev and showed that there was large enhancement of strongly damped yields , the characteristic of a long - lived orbiting @xmath2ne + @xmath1c dinuclear system .",
    "the aim of the present paper was to extend the investigation on fragment yield from @xmath2ne + @xmath1c reaction at higher excitation energies , which might allow us to have a better understanding of orbiting vis-@xmath20-vis fusion - fission processes for @xmath2ne + @xmath1c system .",
    "if a long - lived rotating dinuclear complex is formed in these reactions , mass and charge transfer should also occur , which leads to typical deep - inelastic reaction yields .",
    "therefore , backangle measurements for rearrangement channels became of interest .",
    "in addition to that the excitation function measurements , for the dependence of the average total kinetic energy ( @xmath21 ) loss on bombarding energy for each binary exit channel , would provide an important probe of the dynamical properties of the long - lived dinuclear complex . with this motivation , we have studied the fragment emission spectra from the reaction @xmath2ne + @xmath1c at e@xmath22 = 145 , 158 , 170 , 180 and 200 mev , respectively .",
    "a part of the present data has already been reported @xcite , which showed enhancement in yield of carbon and boron fragments well above the standard statistical model predictions .",
    "the paper has been arranged as follows .",
    "section ii describes the experimental procedures . in sec .",
    "iii we present the analysis of @xmath2ne + @xmath1c data .",
    "the results have been discussed in sec iv . finally , the summary and conclusions are presented in sec . v.",
    "the experiment was performed using accelerated @xmath2ne ion beams of energies 145 , 158 , 170 , 180 and 200 mev , respectively , from the variable energy cyclotron at kolkata .",
    "the target used was @xmath18 550 @xmath23g/@xmath24 self - supporting @xmath1c .",
    "different fragments ( 5 @xmath0 z @xmath0 13 ) have been detected using two solid state [ si(sb ) ] telescopes ( @xmath18 10 @xmath23 m @xmath25e , 300 @xmath23 m e ) mounted on one arm of the 91.5 cm scattering chamber .",
    "two solid state telescopes ( @xmath18 50 @xmath23 m , 100 @xmath23 m @xmath25e [ si(sb ) ] and 5 mm e [ si(li ) ] ) were mounted on the other arm of the scattering chamber for the detection of light charged particles and light fragments ( 1 @xmath0 z @xmath0 4 ) ; the same detectors were also used as monitor detectors for normalization purposes .",
    "typical solid angle subtended by each detector was @xmath180.3 msr .",
    "the telescopes were calibrated using elastically scattered @xmath2ne ion from au , al targets and a th-@xmath9 source .",
    "the systematic errors in the data , arising from the uncertainties in the measurements of solid angle , target thickness and the calibration of current digitizer have been estimated to be @xmath26 15% .",
    "part of these uncertainties are due to the extrapolation procedures employed to extract the fully damped yields from the sequential decay components by the use of monte carlo simulations described in sec . iv a.",
    "inclusive energy distributions for various fragments ( 3 @xmath0 z @xmath0 13 ) have been measured in the angular range 10@xmath4 - 50@xmath4 for all the bombarding energies . this covered backward angles in the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "frame , because of the inverse kinematics of the reactions .",
    "typical energy spectra of the emitted fragments ( 3 @xmath0 z @xmath0 13 ) obtained at an angle 10@xmath4 at @xmath27 = 170 mev are shown in fig .",
    "it is evident that the energy spectra for lighter fragents ( 3 @xmath0 z @xmath0 6 ) exhibit strong peaking in energy .",
    "the peaks are nearly gaussian in shape having its centroid at the expected kinetic energies for the fission fragments obtained from the viola systematics corrected by the corresponding asymmetry factors @xcite and are shown by arrows in fig .",
    "the shapes of the energy spectra for the other heavier fragments ( 7 @xmath0 z @xmath0 13 ) are quite different from those obtained for the lighter ones .",
    "the additional contributions from di and qe processes have been seen in the higher energy part of the spectra . moreover , there are contributions from the recoiling nuclei ( energy corresponding to @xmath28 , shown by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ nec1 ] ) .",
    "all these contibutions , other than fission fragments , fall off rapidly as one moves away from the grazing angle . in this paper , we report the results from the lighter fragments ( z = 37 ) .    the inclusive energy distributions for the fragments lithium ( z = 3 ) , beryllium ( z = 4 ) , boron ( z = 5 ) , carbon ( z = 6 ) and nitrogen ( z = 7 ) obtained at an angle 10@xmath4 at various bombarding energies are shown in fig .",
    "it is observed that at all bombarding energies the energy spectra of the ejectiles ( li , be , b , c , n ) are nearly gaussian in shape and they have been fitted with a single gaussian .",
    "the non - gaussian shapes at the low - energy side of the spectra correspond to sequential decay processes  which can be simulated by monte - carlo statistical model calculations ( described in sec .",
    "the gaussian fits so obtained are shown by solid lines in fig .",
    "the centroids ( shown by arrows ) are found to correspond to the scission of deformed dinuclear configuration @xcite .",
    "this suggests that , in all cases , the fragments are emitted from fully energy relaxed composite  as expected for both ff and orbiting processes",
    ". the increasing yields at lower energies may also be due to the second kinematical solution , which is a signature of binary nature of emission process .",
    "the average velocities of the fragments have been computed from the measured energies and from the z values using the empirical relation proposed by charity _",
    "@xcite : @xmath29 the average velocities of the fragments obtained at different bombarding energies have been plotted in the @xmath30 vs. @xmath31 plane in fig .",
    "it is seen that at all energies , the average velocities of different fragments fall on a circle centered around the respective @xmath32 , the compound nuclear velocity .",
    "this suggests that at all bombarding energies the average velocities ( as well as kinetic energies ) of the fragments are independent of the c.m .",
    "emission angles and indicates that at all these energies the fragments are emitted from a fully equilibrated cn - like source with full momentum transfer . the magnitude of the average fragment velocities ( _ i.e. _ , the radii of the circles in fig .",
    "[ nec3 ] ) decreases with the increase of fragment mass , which is indicative of the binary nature of the emission .",
    "the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "angular distributions of the fragments ( li , be , b , c , and n ) emitted in the @xmath2ne ( 145 , 158 , 170 , 180 and 200 mev ) + @xmath1c reactions are shown in fig .",
    "the transformations from the laboratory to center - of - mass system have been done with the assumption of a two body kinematics averaged over total kinetic energy distributions .",
    "angular distributions of these fragments obtained at all bombarding energies follow the 1/sin@xmath33 -like variation ( shown by solid lines in fig .",
    "[ nec4 ] )  which further corroborate the conjecture of emission from fully equilibrated composite .",
    "the average total kinetic energies in the center - of - mass , @xmath21 , for the fragments ( @xmath34 ) obtained at all bombarding energies , have been displayed as a function of scattering angle in fig .",
    "the average fragment kinetic energies in the center - of - mass have been obtained from the respective laboratory values assuming two body kinematics .",
    "it is observed from fig .",
    "[ nec5 ] that @xmath21 values are almost constant for each of the exit channel .",
    "the near constancy of @xmath21 indicates that at all energies the lifetime of the dinuclear complex is longer than the time needed to completely damp the energy in the relative motion @xcite .",
    "the predictions of viola systematics @xcite for fission fragment kinetic energies , corrected by an asymmetric factor @xcite , have been shown by solid lines in fig .",
    "the @xmath21 values predicted from viola systematics are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data at all bombarding energies .",
    "the variations of average q - value , @xmath19 , with center - of - mass emission angle for the fragments li , be , b , c , and n obtained at different bombarding energies are shown in fig .",
    "it is observed that the @xmath19 of different fragments are independent of the center - of - mass emission angles at all bombarding energies .",
    "this is in contrast to the observation made earlier for other light systems ( @xmath14o ( 116 mev ) + @xmath35al , @xmath11si , @xmath2ne ( 145 mev ) + @xmath35al , @xmath36co systems ) , where sharp fall off of @xmath19 with angle have been seen @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 values remain nearly constant which further suggest that at all angles , the fragments are emitted from completely equilibrated source at all incident energies considered here .",
    "the energy distributions , velocity diagrams , angular distributions and @xmath19 distributions indicate that the yield of these fragments ( z = 3  7 ) originates from fully energy relaxed events associated with the decay of either compound nucleus or long - lived , orbiting dinuclear system .",
    "a detailed investigation have been made to decipher the role played by aforementioned processes in the fragment yield by comparing the experimental yields with the theoretical predictions of the standard statistical model @xcite , extended hauser - feshbach model ( ehfm ) @xcite . the experimental angle integrated yields of the fragments emitted in the @xmath2ne + @xmath1c reaction at different bombarding energies are shown in fig .  [ nec7 ] by solid circles ( taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ) and triangles .",
    "the theoretical predictions of the statistical model code cascade @xcite are shown by solid lines in fig .",
    "the calculations are done considering @xmath37 values up to the critical angular momentum of fusion , @xmath15 , at each energy ( given in table [ tbl1 ] ) .",
    "it is observed that at all energies the experimental yields of the fragments li and be are in fair agreement with the theoretical cascade prediction .",
    "however , the yields of the fragments b , c and n ( near entrance channel ) obtained at different energies are much higher than those predicted by the statistical model code cascade .",
    "a similar observation has been reported by shapira _",
    "@xcite for the same system at lower energies for carbon fragment .",
    "the theoretical predictions using ehfm have also been shown by dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ nec7 ] for the fragments b , c and n. the ehfm predictions also similar to those obtained from cascade calculations and the experimental yields are in fair excess of the theoretical estimates of both cascade and ehfm .",
    "the average q values ( @xmath19 ) for the fragments li , be , b , c , and n have been plotted in fig .  [ nec8 ] as a function of the incident energy .",
    "the linear dependence of @xmath19 with energy provides strong evidence that the long life time may be associated with an orbiting phenomenon .",
    "this linear dependence of @xmath19 can be expressed by simple equation of the form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the slope and @xmath40 is the intercept ( for example , @xmath19 = ( 14.9 @xmath41 1.0 ) - ( 0.97 @xmath41 0.02 ) e@xmath42 for the fragment carbon ) .",
    "the experimentally determined intercepts are found to be in fair agreement with kinetic energies calculated using viola systematics .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath19 values obtained in the present experiment between 145 mev and 200 mev fall on the same straight line extrapolated from the lower energy ( @xmath1854  81 mev ) data @xcite .",
    "this means that the energy relaxation is complete for the fragment emission studied here up to the incident energy of 200 mev .",
    "moreover , it also means that the final kinetic energy ( e@xmath43 = @xmath19 + e@xmath42 ) is nearly independent of bombarding energy  which may be due to the limitation on the maximum value of angular momentum beyond which the formation of di - nucleus is not allowed due to centrifugal repulsion @xcite .",
    "in general , the energy distributions , the angular distributions and the total fragment yields measured for @xmath2ne + @xmath1c reaction at incident energies between 145 mev and 200 mev are similar to those obtained at lower incident energies ( @xmath18 50 - 80 mev ) for the same system ( see refs .",
    "large energy damping , 1/sin@xmath33 dependence of angular distribution and near constancy of @xmath19 over a wide angular range signify that the fragment decay originates from a long lived , fully energy equilibrated system .",
    "however , the large enhancement of fragment emission cross section ( 5 @xmath0 z @xmath0 7 ) over the statistical - model predictions leads to the conjecture that the orbiting mechanism may still play a major role at these energies .",
    "the possibility of these enhancements , either due to feeding from the secondary deexcitation of the heavier fragments or due to orbiting mechanism , are investigated in great details and described in the following subsections .",
    "there is a possibility that the primary heavier fragments ( formed due to the binary decay of composite system ) may have sufficient excitation energy to deexcite through the emission of light particles and @xmath44-rays and contribute to the yield of lighter fragments .",
    "this additional contribution from the secondary decay increases the total elemental yield of the lighter fragments . to check whether the enhancement in b , c , and n yield could be due to feeding from the secondary decay of heavier fragments of various possible binary breakup combinations",
    ", we have performed detailed simulations of secondary decay using the monte - carlo binary decay version of the statistical decay code lilita @xcite and the statistical model code cascade @xcite and pace4 @xcite .",
    "secondary decay of si@xmath45 ( binary channel @xmath11si + @xmath46he ) , al@xmath45 ( binary channel @xmath47al + @xmath48li ) , mg@xmath45 ( binary channel @xmath49 mg + @xmath50be ) , na@xmath45 ( binary channel @xmath51na + @xmath52b ) , ne@xmath45 ( binary channel @xmath2ne + @xmath1c ) , f@xmath45 ( binary channel @xmath53f + @xmath54n ) , o@xmath45 ( binary channel @xmath14o + @xmath14o ) , n@xmath55 ( binary channel @xmath54n + @xmath53f ) , c@xmath55 ( binary channel @xmath1c + @xmath2ne ) , b@xmath55 ( binary channel @xmath52b + @xmath51na ) and be@xmath55 ( binary channel @xmath50be + @xmath49 mg ) have been studied .",
    "indeed the lilita calculations ( using the parameter set proposed in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite and assuming the excitation energy division follows the mass ratio @xcite ) are in qualitative agreement with the experimental results obtained at 9 mev / nucleon by rae et al .",
    "@xcite for the sequential decay of @xmath2ne + @xmath1c .",
    "it was found that even at the highest excitation energy , secondary decay of si@xmath45 and al@xmath45 do not reach up to n ; the contribution of primary mg@xmath55 , na@xmath55 decay to z @xmath0 7 were estimated to be @xmath6 1% of the primary yield and that of ne@xmath45 decay to n , c , b yield were estimated to be @xmath18 1020% , @xmath18 1520% and @xmath18 3050% of the primary yield , respectively .",
    "nearly @xmath18 4045% of the primary o@xmath45 produced through binary exit channel @xmath14o + @xmath14o decays to c. the secondary decay yields from the primary excited fragments are shown in fig .",
    "[ nec9 ] for different bombarding energies . as the binary yield of o ,",
    "f are small ( @xmath18 10% of the binary ne yield , as estimated from cascade @xcite ) , overall secondary decay contribution from o , f are smaller than that from ne .",
    "moreover , the simulations of energy distributions of the secondary decay yield of c from ne as well as f , o using the code lilita show that they peak at much lower energies ( typically , at @xmath18 4550 mev for ne , @xmath18 4855 mev for f and @xmath18 5560 mev for o , compared to the peak of the experimental energy distribution at @xmath18 7595 mev ) .",
    "now , the gaussian fitting procedure for the extraction of primary fragment yield is fairly efficient in rejecting most of the low energy tail ( typical rejection ratio @xmath18 2540% of the total yield ) .",
    "the energy distributions of the secondary decay have been shown in fig .",
    "[ nec10 ] for carbon , in fig .",
    "[ nec11 ] for boron and in fig .",
    "[ nec12 ] for nitrogen . in the inset of these figures",
    "the spectra shown are the difference spectra ; the difference between the experimental spectra and the gaussian fitted to the spectra .",
    "it has been found that the secondary decay distributions reproduce the difference spectra very well for all the cases .",
    "it is thus evident that the secondary decay component does not interfere with the estimated primary yield for two reasons : firstly , total secondary decay yield is not quite large , and secondly , the gaussian fitting procedure for the extraction of primary yield does take care , to a large extent , of the rejection of the contributions of the secondary decay components as their energy distributions are different from those of the primary components .      it has been observed that the statistical model calculations do not reproduce most of the observed experimental yields , therefore , an additional reaction component corresponding to the orbiting mechanism has to be considered .",
    "the large measured cross sections for b , c and n fragments led to the suggestion that an orbiting , di - nuclear configuration is formed that decays back to the entrance channel . after the discovery of orbiting in the @xmath11si + @xmath1c system , similar enhancements of large - angle , binary - reaction yields are also observed in the present data .",
    "it is expected that the orbiting mechanism will retain a greater memory of the entrance channel than the fusion - fission process .",
    "the trapped , dinuclear complex can either evolve with complete amalgamation into a fully equilibrated compound nucleus or , alternatively , escape into a binary exit channel by way of orbiting trajectories .",
    "orbiting can therefore be described in terms of the formation of a long - lived di - nuclear molecular complex which acts as a  doorway \" state to fusion with a strong memory of the entrance channel .",
    "the equilibrium orbiting model has been used to successfully explain both the observed cross sections and total kinetic energy ( tke ) values of the fully damped fragments for several lighter nuclear systems at lower energies .",
    "the theoretical prediction of the equilibrium model for orbiting and fusion @xcite is denoted by dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ nec7 ] for the fragment b , c and n , and it also fails to explain the large enhancement in the fragment yield .",
    "the curve displayed in fig .",
    "[ nec7 ] represents the  best fit \" that can be obtained by the orbiting model with a reasonable choice of the bass potential parameters ( strengths , short range , and long range of the proximity potential ) .",
    "it is , therefore , evident that both the equilibrium orbiting and statistical decay ( cascade , ehfm ) models result in comparable disagreement with the data .",
    "it may be interesting to note here that shapira _",
    "_ studied the same reaction at lower energies @xcite and came to the conclusion that the large enhancements in the energy damped fragment yield observed at those energies might be due to nuclear orbiting phenomenon .    the shortcomings of the equilibrium model for orbiting does not imply that the presence of an orbiting mechanism , as distinct from fission , can be ruled out . on the contrary",
    ", there may be a large orbiting - like contribution from non fusion window ( in the angular momentum window @xmath56 ) .",
    "this is consistent , at least qualitatively , from the fact that , cascade calculation @xcite performed with @xmath37 values up to @xmath16 ( shown by dashed lines in fig .",

    "this implies the dominance of orbiting yield over the compound nucleus yield .",
    "the large orbiting yields that account for the largest part of the fully damped yields of @xmath2ne + @xmath1c can be qualitatively understood in the framework of the number of open channels ( noc ) model @xcite .",

    "this very deep minimum ( noc = 4.5 ) explains : ( i ) why resonant structures have been observed to be significant in @xmath2ne + @xmath1c @xcite and , ( ii ) why the orbiting yields observed for c fragments are much larger than the cascade predictions .",
    "the comparison with @xmath57f + @xmath1c is instructive at @xmath59 = 60 mev @xcite ( the corresponding value of the yield of fragment c for @xmath2ne + @xmath1c , as given in table  [ tbl1 ] , has been extracted from fig .",

    "it is worth noting from table  [ tbl1 ] that cascade predicts almost identical fusion - fission cross section for both reactions at @xmath59 = 60 mev . on the other hand , due to the survival of orbiting at energies larger than 7 mev / nucleon , the fully damped yields are much more than a factor of two bigger for the @xmath2ne + @xmath1c system at @xmath59 = 60 mev .",

    "this indicates the presence of other type of reaction process , namely orbiting .",
    "in contrast , the study of the nearby system @xmath57f ( 96 mev ) + @xmath1c clearly showed that the fragments are emitted in the fusion - fission process @xcite .",
    "low values of noc @xcite obtained for @xmath2ne + @xmath1c system as compared to the same obtained for @xmath57f + @xmath1c system also confirms the conjecture of survival of orbiting in @xmath2ne + @xmath1c system at higher excitations .",
    "it is interesting to mention at this point that , @xmath14o , @xmath2ne + @xmath11si systems @xcite , even though @xmath9-like , do not show the characteristics of orbiting at these energies , but orbiting - like behaviour has been observed for @xmath11si + @xmath14o reaction at lower energies @xcite .",
    "the present analysis also indicates that the enhancement in fragment yield for @xmath2ne + @xmath1c reactions can not be explained by the equilibrium orbiting model @xcite .",
    "this may be due to the fact that , the equilibrium orbiting model in its present form seems to be inadequate to explain the phenomena at higher excitations , and a more complete understanding of orbiting and vis - a - vis the angular momentum dissipation ( which plays a crucial role in defining orbiting trajectories and yield ) will be required .",
