    "the two required lattice distortions are pictured in figure  [ f : dist ] .",
    "a ) and b ) . from a symmetry analysis of the different tilt patterns in combination with possible jahn - teller lattice distortions , howard and carpenter pointed out that a jahn - teller distortion pattern automatically appears when considering the @xmath2 symmetry  @xcite , later explained in terms of anharmonic couplings with afd motions  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "a jahn - teller distortion is not necessarily electronically driven , but can instead arise from lattice mode couplings in which case a splitting of the electronic states may develop even in the absence of a degeneracy of states .",
    "the present jahn - teller lattice motion corresponds to a q@xmath1 mode as defined by goodenough  @xcite , corresponding to two b - o bond length contractions and two b - o elongations .",
    "this motion orders at the m point of the brillouin zone and hence consecutive layers along the @xmath5 axis of the @xmath2 phase present in - phase distortions .",
    "consequently , this motion is labelled q@xmath6 ( irreps m@xmath7 ) throughout the whole manuscript .",
    "starting from the ideal @xmath8 cubic perovskite phase , the condensation of the polar mode p ( irreps @xmath9 ) and the jt mode q@xmath6 lowers the symmetry to a @xmath0 phase , a polar subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "we then perform a free energy expansion  @xcite in terms of the possible lattice distortions in this new phase and we identify , among all the possible terms , some intriguing couplings : @xmath10 in this phase , the first two terms of equation  [ e : free ] provide a link between the polarization and the jahn - teller distortion .",
    "these terms also involve two additional distortions : one anti - polar a motion pictured in figure  [ f : dist ] .",
    "c ) and one @xmath11 afd motion ( labelled @xmath12 ) pictured in figure  [ f : dist ] .",
    "d ) . among all the terms , the lowest order trilinear term of the form @xmath13",
    "provides the desired direct coupling between the polarization and the jt distortion .",
    "thus , acting on the polarization with an external electric field may modify the amplitude of the jt motion , and therefore all related electronic properties .    however , as previously discussed , the @xmath0 symmetry is not the common ground state in bulk perovskites  @xcite .",
    "strain engineering , through thin film epitaxy for example , can provide a powerful tool to unlock a polar mode in perovskites  @xcite .",
    "this is the case for bifeo@xmath4 that was recently proposed to adopt an unusual @xmath0 symmetry under large epitaxial tensile strain  @xcite .",
    "this particular phase was shown to develop both polar , anti - polar and @xmath14 afd motions  @xcite , which were later demonstrated to be coupled together through the third term of eq .",
    "[ e : free ]  @xcite . amazingly , the authors reported the existence of an orbital ordering of the fe@xmath15 @xmath16 orbitals , explained from the coexistence of the polar and the anti - polar motion yielding a particular lattice distortion pattern  @xcite .",
    "this orbital - ordering is unusual since in this system no jahn - teller effect is required to form a mott insulating state ( fe@xmath15 are in a half filled - high spin @xmath17@xmath18 configuration ) . a jahn - teller effect or distortion",
    "are yet to be reported in the @xmath0 phase of bifeo@xmath4 to the best of our knowledge . from our symmetry analysis ,",
    "we clearly demonstrate that as this @xmath0 develops the three aforementioned distortions ( p , a and @xmath12 ) , the free energy of eq .  [ e : free ] is automatically lowered through the appearance of a fourth lattice distortion : a jahn - teller q@xmath6 motion . therefore ,",
    "whilst it may not itself be unstable , the jahn - teller motion is forced into the system via this ",
    "improper \" mechanism arising from the trilinear coupling  @xcite .",
    "this result clarifies the origin of the unusual orbital - ordering displayed by bifeo@xmath4 and moreover , it provides a pathway to achieve an electric field control of the orbital - ordering in bulk perovskites .",
    "the predicted highly strained @xmath0 phase in bulk perovskites is not restricted to bifeo@xmath4 , and it was predicted to occur also in some titanates ( catio@xmath4 and eutio@xmath4 )  @xcite , in bamno@xmath4  @xcite and even in a jahn - teller active compound tbmno@xmath4  @xcite . the highly strained bulk perovskites are then an ideal playground to demonstrate our coupling between the polarization and the jahn - teller distortion . in order to check the generality of our concept , we propose in this letter to investigate several types of highly strained perovskites on the basis of first principles calculations : i ) non magnetic ( nm ) srtio@xmath4 ( @xmath19 ) ; ii ) magnetic bamno@xmath4  @xcite ( @xmath20 ) and bifeo@xmath4 ( @xmath21 ) ; iii ) jahn - teller active ymno@xmath4 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    ".epitaxial strain ( % ) , magnetic ground state , amplitudes of distortions (  ) and electronic band gap value ( ev ) for each material .",
    "we emphasize that only the relevant distortions are summarized in the present table . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we begin by investigating the possibility of a @xmath0 ground state under large epitaxial tensile strain ( the growth direction is along the [ 001 ] axis of the @xmath2 structure ) . beyond around 5% tensile strain",
    ", the four compounds indeed develop the desired @xmath0 ground state .",
    "strained bamno@xmath4 ( ferromagnetic fm ) and ymno@xmath4 ( g - type antiferromagnetic afmg ) exhibit a different magnetic ground state compared to the bulk ( afmg and e - type antiferromagnetic - @xmath23 zig - zag chains coupled antiferromagnetically along the @xmath5 axis - respectively ) while bifeo@xmath4 ( g - type antiferromagnetic afmg ) remains in its bulk magnetic ground state .",
    "we then perform a symmetry mode analysis with respect to a hypothetical @xmath24 phase ( corresponding to @xmath8 for unstrained bulk compounds ) in order to extract the amplitude of the relevant lattice distortions  @xcite ( see table  [ t : dist ] ) . as expected , the four materials develop the required distortions , and amazingly , the magnitude of the q@xmath6 jahn - teller distortion is relatively large , being for instance of the same order of magnitude as the one developed in the prototypical jahn - teller system lamno@xmath4 ( around 0.265   @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , the values of the spontaneous polarization are rather large , reaching 76 @xmath25 for srtio@xmath4 for instance . despite being highly strained",
    ", all materials remain insulating , adopting reasonable electronic band gap values ( see table  [ t : dist ] ) .    to shed more lights on the origin of this unusual @xmath0 phase we compute the energy potentials with respect to the four distortions by condensing individually each modes in an hypothetical @xmath24 phase ( see figure  [ f : potentials ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , the appearance of the @xmath0 phase is rather different for the four materials . srtio@xmath4 and bamno@xmath4 only exhibit a polar instability , producing an @xmath26 symmetry , consistent with previous reports of a polar phase for these two materials under tensile strain  @xcite . computing the phonons in this particular @xmath26 symmetry ,",
    "only one hybrid unstable phonon mode is identified for these two materials , having a mixed character between the a , @xmath12 and q@xmath6 distortions , for bifeo@xmath4 and ymno@xmath4 , the @xmath14 afd motion is already unstable , which is expected since the @xmath0 symmetry for these two systems is derived from their bulk @xmath27/@xmath2 phases  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the jt lattice distortion is also unstable in the @xmath24 phase of ymno@xmath4 and appears as an electronic instability  @xcite , which is expected since ymno@xmath4 is known to be jahn - teller active in the bulk .",
    "we emphasize at this stage that the polar mode in bifeo@xmath4 ( and ymno@xmath4 ) is not unstable and therefore highly strained bifeo@xmath4 appears as an improper ferroelectric in contradiction to reference  .",
    "computing the phonons in the intermediate strained @xmath2 phase of both bifeo@xmath4 and ymno@xmath4 compounds reveals only one hybrid unstable mode , having a mixed character between p and a distortions . despite the apparent universal stability of this highly strained polar phase , the mechanism yielding it is suprisingly different between the compounds . regarding the electronic structure , we checked for the appearance of an orbital ordering as observed in bifeo@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "for the four compounds we report the projected density of states on the @xmath28 levels of two neighboring b sites in the @xmath29-plane ( see figure  [ f : doss - tous ] ) .",
    "for srtio@xmath4 , a splitting of the @xmath30 states , and especially between the @xmath31 and @xmath32 orbitals , located at the bottom of the conduction band arises . for bamno@xmath4 and bifeo@xmath4 ,",
    "a similar splitting between the @xmath30 levels is observed near the fermi level , even if it is less pronounced for bamno@xmath4 since it has the smallest @xmath33 distortion .",
    "finally , ymno@xmath4 displays an orbital ordering of the @xmath34 levels with predominantly @xmath35 occupation .",
    "this splitting is known to result of the jahn - teller distortion in this a@xmath15mn@xmath15o@xmath4 class of material  @xcite . additionally , an orbital ordering of the @xmath30 levels is occurring both in the conduction and the valence bands .",
    "to prove that the jahn - teller distortion , and not another motion , is solely responsible for the orbital ordering we have condensed all the modes individually and studied the density of states ( see supplementary figure 1 ) .",
    "finally , we explicitly demonstrate the electric field control of jahn - teller distortion by computing , as a function of the electric field @xmath36 applied along the direction of the spontaneous polarization , the evolution of both the jt distortion and the band gap .",
    "results are displayed in figure  [ f : efield ] .",
    "the jahn - teller distortion is effectively altered by the application of an electric field along the polar axis through the first and second terms of equation  [ e : free ] . as the electric field increases , the amplitude of the jt distortion is either amplified or decreased , being renormalized to around 175% for srtio@xmath4 for an electric field around 20 mv.@xmath37 .",
    "the largest effect is however reached for ymno@xmath4 which displays a renormalization of 130% under moderate electric field ( around 5 mv.@xmath37 ) .",
    "therefore , this renormalization of the jt distortion has consequences for instance on the electronic band gap value , with an opening / closure around 0.6 ev for ymno@xmath4 or 0.25 ev for srtio@xmath4 .",
    "it is then possible , through the coupling between the polarization and the jahn - teller distortion to act on the electronic band gap , and one may imagine a possible control of a metal - insulator phase transition , optical properties , or photovoltaic efficiency , for instance .    in conclusion",
    ", we have demonstrated in the highly strained @xmath0 phase of bulk perovskites the existence of a coupling between a polar mode and the jahn - teller distortion .",
    "this improper anharmonic coupling , established on universal symmetry arguments , enables an electric field control of the jahn - teller distortion , even in the case of non electronically jahn - teller active systems .",
    "the generic mechanism may open novel functionalities in perovskites as it will have consequences on related electronic properties as proposed in the present letter .",
    "for instance , such couplings may allow the tuning of metal - insulator phase transitions , the control of orbital orderings , optical properties , or of the photovoltaic efficiency .",
    "first - principles calculations were performed with the vasp package  @xcite .",
    "we used the pbesol  @xcite+u framework as implemented by lichtenstein s method  @xcite ( see the supplementary material for a discussion on the choice of the u and j parameters ) .",
    "the plane wave cut - off was set to 500 ev and we used a 6@xmath386@xmath384 k - point mesh for the 20 atom @xmath0 phase .",
    "paw pseudopotentials  @xcite were used in the calculations with the following valence electron configuration : @xmath39 ( sr ) , @xmath40 ( ba ) , @xmath41 ( y ) , @xmath42 ( bi ) , @xmath43 ( ti ) , @xmath44 ( mn ) , @xmath45 ( fe ) and @xmath46 ( o ) .",
    "spontaneous polarizations were computed using the berry - phase approach and phonons and born effective charges were computed using the density functional perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the electric field effect was modelled using a linear response approach by freezing - in some lattice distortion into the system  @xcite .",

    "being in the @xmath0 phase is sufficient but _ a priori _ not mandatory to achieve our goal .",
    "from eq  [ e : free ] , only the coupling between the polar and jt distortions is key to achieve an electric field control of the jahn - teller distortions .",

    "applying an electric field would activate the polar mode and through the first term of eq .",
