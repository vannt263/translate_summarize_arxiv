    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are thought to be driven by mass accretion onto compact objects @xcite .",
    "the enabling cooling mechanism allowing accretion is neutrino emission , raising the usual eddington rate for photons by sixteen orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this applies both to long and short grbs , perhaps due to the collapse of massive rotating stars @xcite and compact binary mergers @xcite , respectively , or magnetized neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the prompt gamma - ray emission originates at @xmath0  cm from this source , possibly from internal shocks in the relativistic outflow generated by the engine @xcite .",
    "the engine itself is hidden from view due to the high opacities , and can be potentially probed directly only through gravitational waves and neutrinos .    the observed time series in grb prompt emission show diversity between events ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : some have a single peak , others multiple emission episodes , with correlations between the fluence of the active period and the length of the quiescent interval preceding it @xcite . on top of this , rapid ( ms ) fluctuations are routinely observed .",
    "fourier analysis of the high - energy light curves of the prompt emission in grbs in the source frame reveals power - law spectra @xcite , with index @xmath1 and a break at @xmath2  hz .",
    "variability is likely due to a combination of several effects , allowing in principle an additional way to probe the central engine indirectly .",
    "some are probably intrinsic to the progenitor : the distribution of angular momentum with radius inside the star in the case of a collapsar may lead to distinct episodes of energy release @xcite ; the fall back at late times of material stripped from a tidally disrupted neutron star is capable of powering secondary accretion episodes @xcite ; hydrodynamical or magnetic instabilities in the accretion disk may result in intermittent accretion @xcite .",
    "others can come from the relativistic outflow : the interaction of a jet with high lorentz factor with the stellar envelope before breakout can lead to irregularities and shocking @xcite ; the outcome of internal shocks between shells in the flow depends on the variation in mass and energy upon ejection @xcite .",
    "an additional factor , upon which we focus here , is related to the variability present in the accretion disk as a result of turbulent motions .",
    "the dissipation is related to the local hydrodynamical variables , and as these vary in time , so will the energy output .    the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) @xcite is a possible mechanism that will allow for the transport of angular momentum in accretion disks with differential rotation .",
    "its behavior under the physical conditions in neutrino cooled disks , which are similar to those occurring in supernovae , but different from the usual ones present in x - ray binaries and agn , has come under scrutiny more recently @xcite .",
    "one such difference lies in the sensitivity of the cooling rate to temperature and is at the heart of this work . whereas , for example , the photon bremsstrahlung emissivity scales as @xmath3 in the optically thin limit , for neutrinos @xmath4 , where @xmath5 depending on the cooling process .",
    "further , while photon - cooled disks are typically optically thick , @xmath6 , for a wide range of relevant parameters their neutrino - cooled counterparts are optically thin , @xmath7 , tightly coupling the local conditions to the emitted luminosity .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we characterize the local variability in neutrino cooled disks through shearing box mhd simulations (   [ sec : shear ] ) , and then use the results of global disk simulations to scale the results for the central engine as a whole (   [ sec : global ] ) .",
    "prospects for placing constraints on grbs are discussed in   [ sec : prospects ] .",
    "the local flow in the disk is modeled by the shearing box approximation @xcite : a rectangular cartesian coordinate system represents a local neighborhood inside the disk , at an arbitrary orbital radius @xmath8 with dimensions which are much smaller than @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 axes represent the radial , azimuthal and vertical directions in the disk , respectively .",
    "the radial component of the central object s gravity is included , and differential rotation is replaced by a keplerian shear flow along the @xmath10 direction .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are set in @xmath10 and @xmath11 , while in @xmath9 these are `` shearing periodic '' : upon crossing a radial boundary , a fluid element is displaced along @xmath10 by an amount given by the shear value .",
    "the eulerian zeus-3d code [ @xcite ] is used to solve the equations of ideal mhd .",
    "these are :    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    and an ideal gas equation of state with @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the gas velocity , density and pressure , respectively , @xmath20 is the magnetic field , @xmath21 is the disk angular frequency , @xmath22 is the internal energy density , and @xmath23 is a unitary radial vector .    the second term on the right - hand side of eq.([eq : energy ] ) is added to model neutrino cooling processes , with the nature of the particular emission mechanism fixing the value of @xmath24 . in grb",

    "we used @xmath29 , thus the cooling time is much longer than the dynamical time .",

    "turbulent motions induced by the mri develop in the simulation on a time scale @xmath35 , leading to turbulent transport of angular momentum .",
    "the fundamental output of the simulations is the luminosity as a function of time of the shearing box , which we denote as @xmath36 .    , for shearing box simulations with cooling mimicking pair capture ( blue , @xmath37 ) and pair annihilation ( red , @xmath38 ) .",

    "these changes can be characterized by their fourier transform , @xmath39 , where @xmath41 is the signal frequency ( figure  [ fig : luminosity ] ) . roughly , the spectrum is a power law , @xmath42 , over a wide range of frequencies in the case of @xmath37 , with more complicated behavior superimposed in the case of @xmath38 .",
    "it is clear that the variations in energy release have a characteristic behavior , with the details varying according to the specific cooling mechanism .",
    "to find the global variability we require the superposition of a very large number of smaller regions represented by the shearing box calculations , and approximations are necessary to proceed further .",
    "we assume equatorial and azimuthal symmetry , and also take the disk to be in a stationary state .",
    "obtaining global quantities thus requires integrating over the polar angle @xmath43 $ ] and radius @xmath44 $ ] .",

    "dynamical simulations of such disks show that @xmath56 . if @xmath57 , the signal at frequency @xmath41 is thus diminished with respect to the idealized case of entirely in - phase contributions by a factor @xmath58 , due to the random nature of the phase de - correlation .",
    "if , on the contrary , @xmath59 , the signal at frequency @xmath41 is added constructively .",
    "this acts as a broad low - pass filter by slightly suppressing the signal at high frequencies , when @xmath60 .",
    "carrying out this filtering procedure also requires scaling the fiducial model to different radii , which we now address .",
    "+ the emissivity is not a function of azimuthal position , but it is one of radius . given the extreme sensitivity of the cooling rate to temperature , only the innermost regions of the disk contribute to the luminosity , and thus to its variability properties .",
    "the argument given above for the decoupling of azimuthal zones in the disk for a particular frequency is also applicable to the radial coordinate .",
    "advection may modify this slightly , but for our present purpose it is valid enough to say that as the flow is split up into @xmath61 zones in azimuth , it is divided into rings of characteristic size @xmath62 .",

    "we have re - computed their evolution for this work for two test cases , with @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in the first model , @xmath71 ,",
    "we have eliminated all sources of cooling except from pair captures , where @xmath75 , while in the second , @xmath72 , we have only kept that due to pair annihilation , with @xmath76 .",
    "each model can then be more faithfully compared with the two fiducial runs for the shearing box with @xmath40 respectively , using a near - stationary state where the accretion rate is @xmath77  m@xmath78  s@xmath79 .",
    "we first compute the equatorial radial profile of emissivity in simulations @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath80 , shown in figure  [ fig : qdotr ] . at small radii the dominant contribution comes from pair capture , while annihilation dominates for @xmath81 .",
    "the combination is a strongly decreasing function of @xmath45 , so the radial convolution need not be extended to infinity , and pair capture dominates the total emission , as well as its general behavior .",
    "the inner radius of the disk is @xmath82 , where the effects of general relativity truncate the flow .",
    "we have used @xmath83 , and checked that the final result is insensitive to this choice , as long as @xmath84 .    to perform the radial integral ,",
    "the time series @xmath36 and @xmath39 need to be scaled to the disk at different radii @xmath45 .",
    "the characteristic break frequency in the fiducial spectrum for the volume - averaged total ( maxwell and reynolds ) stress , measured as an equivalent @xmath85 viscosity parameter , is roughly at the orbital frequency , @xmath52 .",
    "this is related to the nature of the mri , where , @xmath86 .",
    "the orbital angular frequency is known as a function of radius , @xmath87 , so we can convert from frequency to radius , @xmath39 to @xmath88 and integrate over different annuli ( the expression for @xmath89 is appropriate for the pseudo - relativistic potential used ) .    , for models @xmath71 ( red ) and @xmath72 ( blue ) .",
    "the power is given in arbitrary units as a function of frequency ( in hz ) for a black hole with @xmath90 .",
    "the black line shows the result of a test calculation with local cooling in the shearing box simulation set to @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath92 .",
    "the error bars for @xmath40 include the scatter from the fourier transform in the plotted frequency bins and sampling errors in the radial discretization of the convolution . ]",
    "the power associated to the variability in the neutrino luminosity can now be computed as : @xmath93 where @xmath80 corresponds to model @xmath71 or @xmath72 , and @xmath94 and @xmath95 account for the filtering at high frequencies .",
    "figure  [ fig : pds ] shows the resulting spectra , where several features clearly stand out . at low frequencies , @xmath960.1  hz",
    ", the spectrum is the same in both cases , @xmath97 .",
    "for @xmath98 the results diverge : model @xmath71 approximately maintains the power law decay , while model @xmath72 shows an excess , and in general more complex behavior , with broad features at @xmath99 and 40  hz overlaid on a decay with lower index , @xmath100 . at @xmath101 100  hz ,",
    "a break to a more rapidly decaying power law terminates both spectra .",
    "the errors are greater for model @xmath72 , due to greater scatter in the fourier transform .",
    "the thin black line in figure  [ fig : pds ] is from a shearing box test calculation with @xmath91 , i.e. , with @xmath92 ( the smaller error bars are not plotted for clarity ) . as the sensitivity of the cooling term to the temperature rises ,",
    "the trend is for an excess in power at higher frequencies , and a more moderate background power law decay .",
    "through shearing box mhd simulations we have characterized the time variability of the energy release at small scales in a neutrino - cooled accretion disk around a black hole , where energy losses primordially come from @xmath25 pair capture onto free nucleons and protons and pair annihilation . with the use of cooling profiles from large scale , two - dimensional simulations of full disks",
    ", we have convolved this local variability to obtain a global signature of time variations in the power output , through the power density spectrum of the neutrino luminosity .",
    "since accretion is enabled by the cooling through neutrinos , we take this as an indicator of central engine variability which will be reflected in the relativistic outflow eventually giving rise to a grb .",
    "the power spectrum exhibits characteristic features related to the general nature of the neutrino cooling in the optically thin regime , and particularly to its temperature dependence .",
    "a background power law decay , with index @xmath102 extends approximately from 0.1 - 100  hz . for emissivities @xmath103",
    ", additional power appears at high frequencies as @xmath24 rises , with the particular values of the slopes and cuttoffs scaling with the cooling mechanism ( fig.[fig : pds ] ) .",
    "this result thus provides in principle a discriminant for grb central engines powered by neutrino - cooled accretion flows , and illustrates how any local mechanism can be used in the same way to test its viability .",
    "the reason for the difference when modifying the cooling mechanism is fundamentally related to the local energy balance . for @xmath104 ( model @xmath105 and a given internal energy supply , @xmath22 , the local cooling time @xmath106 is shorter under a temperature perturbation @xmath107 than when @xmath75 ( model @xmath71 ) .",
    "the power is thus higher at such frequencies , leading to the observed displacement in fig .",
    "[ fig : pds ] .",
    "the argument holds when comparing model @xmath71 with the test run at @xmath92 , and gives a way to characterize the accretion flow and discriminate between competing mechanisms , if the variations in the neutrino luminosity are directly reflected in the accretion power output which drives a relativistic flow .    two possible scenarios in which the difference between the cooling regimes studied here may be of relevance are worthy of note .",
    "first , the mass of the black hole introduces a scaling into the problem when combined with neutrino cooling .",
    "if @xmath108 is too large , the density and temperature in the accretion flow can be too low for neutrino cooling to operate .",
    "as the bh mass is reduced , pair annihilation , with @xmath109 first becomes effective as an energy sink , followed by pair captures , with @xmath110 .",
    "a signature of the bh mass is thus in principle available in the variability of the flow .",
    "the second case is related to the time evolution of the flow , assuming a certain amount of mass @xmath111 is initially available for accretion , and no further feeding of the central engine takes place .",
    "global disk simulations show that the density and temperature drop as the disk drains into the bh on the viscous time scale . given enough time",
    ", the whole disk will lie on the branch cooled by pair annihilation where @xmath85 particles have formed , below @xmath112\\simeq 6.5 $ ] and @xmath113\\simeq 10 $ ] for the adopted black hole mass ( see also figure  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus the variability may initially behave as in case @xmath71 , and end as in case @xmath72 ( the luminosity will have decreased substantially by then , along with the accretion rate ) .",
    "the associated grb , if one occurs , need not necessarily be powered by neutrinos in order for these effects to be apparent .",
    "the fact that neutrinos are responsible for the cooling process allowing accretion makes them relevant in this context .",
    "a number of limitations apply to this study , and can be matters for further study .",
    "first , the scaling we have used to infer the variability at different radii is strictly valid if the flow is adiabatic .",
    "explicit cooling thus violates this assumption .",
    "however , given the choice of @xmath28 and @xmath114 the associated time scales are such that @xmath115 , making this a reasonable approximation .",
    "second , we have used the neutrino luminosity as a proxy for the manifestation of central engine activity , which could have a neutrino component , but need not be restricted to it .",
    "for example , magnetic fields may power relativistic outflows leading to the observed high - energy emission . in this sense ,",
    "an alternative characterization based on the mass accretion rate @xmath116 through the disk may be of use as well , which can then be associated to the energy output of the relativistic outflow as @xmath117 .",
    "third , this is only the first filter any variability originating in a disk needs to go through before emerging as high - energy photons . a variable mass accretion rate and energy conversion efficiency , propagation through the stellar envelope ( for a massive star progenitor ) , external shocks , and general relativistic effects @xcite , among others ,",
    "can each potentially leave their own fingerprint on the power spectrum . the background upon which they will do so , however ,",
    "must ultimately be related to the flow in the disk itself if that is what is driving the energy release , and is what we focus on in this work .",
    "finally , other mechanisms can potentially be responsible for angular momentum transport and variability in the disk itself , such as thermal , viscous or gravitational instabilities , none of which we have considered here .",
