    "in contrast to any hope for a seamless , unique blackboard description of devices on a laboratory bench , we argue , based on mathematical proofs presented in sec . 3 , that no matter what experimental trials are made , if a quantum model generates calculated probabilities that match given experimentally determined relative frequencies , there are other quantum models that match as well but that differ in their predictions for experiments not yet performed .",
    "the proofs demonstrate what before could only be suspected : between the two pillars of calculation and measurement must stand a third pillar of choice making , involving personal creativity beyond logic , so there can be no reason to expect or demand that any two people choose alike .    what does recognizing choice mean for physicists ? in physics , as in artistic work , pleasure and joy come from the choices one makes that lead to something interesting . looking back",
    ", physicists can hardly help noticing that their proudest accomplishments , whether theoretical or experimental , have involved choices made by reaching beyond logic on the basis of intuition , hunches , analogies  some kind of guess , perhaps inspired , but still outside of logic . to understand the proofs is to see opportunities for making guesses .",

    "these higher - order statistics allow the expression , within quantum mechanics , of the teetering of a balance that happens when forces are nearly equal .",
    "we begin by reviewing some details of detector behavior .      under circumstances to be explored , particle detectors employed to decide among possible quantum states produce unambiguous experimental outcomes .",
    "seen up close , a detecting device consists of two components .",
    "the first is a _",
    "transducer _ such as a photo - diode that responds to light by generating a small current pulse . to tally a transducer response as corresponding to one or another theoretical outcome in the sense of quantum mechanics",
    ", one has to _ classify _ the response using some chosen criterion . as phrased in the engineering language of inputs and outputs , the response of the transducer",
    "is fed as an input to a second component of the detector , in effect an unstable balance implemented as a flip flop ( made of transistors organized into a cross - coupled differential amplifier ) .",
    "the flip - flop produces an out_put _ intended to announce a decision between two possible experimental out_comes _ , say 0 and  1 .",
    "if we think classically , we picture the flip - flop as a ball and two bins , one bin for each possible outcome , separated by a barrier , the height of which can be adjusted , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the ball , starting in bin 0 is kicked by the transducer ; an outcome of 1 is recorded if and only if the balance is tipped and the ball rolls past the barrier into bin  1 .",
    "this ball - and - bin technique avoids ambiguity by virtue of a convention that gives the record a certain leeway : it does not matter if the ball is a little off center in its bin , so long as the ball does not teeter on the barrier between bins .",
    "although usually producing an unambiguous outcome , the flip - flop , seen up close , can teeter in its balancing , perhaps for a long time , before slipping into one bin or the other @xcite .",
    "absent some special intervention , two parties ( people or machines ) to which a teetering output fans out can differ in how they classify this output as an outcome : one finds a 0 , the other finds a 1 . to reduce the risk of disagreement , the two parties have to delay their reading of the output , hopefully until the ball slips into one or the other bin .",
    "ugly in this classical cartoon are two related features : ( 1 ) the ball can teeter forever , so that waiting is no help , and ( 2 ) the mean time for teetering to end is entirely dependent on some _ ad hoc _ assumption about `` noise '' @xcite . although we have described the flip - flop classically , it is built of silicon and glass presumably amenable to quantum modeling .",
    "to see what quantum models offer us , the first step is to recall that a quantum model implies probabilities to be related to an experiment , so that inventing a quantum model and choosing an experimental design go hand in hand .",
    "thirty years ago , thinking not in quantum but in circuit terms , we designed and carried out an experiment to measure teetering of the output of a flip - flop .",
    "as we recognized only recently , the record of this experiment is compatible with some quantum models .",
    "a quantum model to be offered shortly describes the experiment already performed and serves as a guide for designing future experiments to exploit what can be called a statistical texture of force , previously obscured by the `` noise '' invoked in classical analysis .      to experiment with the teetering of a detecting device comprised of a transducer @xmath142 ( for diode ) connected to a flip - flop @xmath143 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we replace the transducer @xmath142 by a laboratory generator of weak electrical pulses to drive @xmath143 .",
    ", one could replace one transistor of flip - flop @xmath143 by a photo - transistor . ]",
    "putting the flip - flop @xmath143 into a teetering state takes very sensitive adjustment of the pulse generator , achieved by feedback from a running average of the outcomes produced by @xmath144 and @xmath145 to the pulse generator .",
    "the output of @xmath143 is made to fan out , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , to a matched pair of flip - flops , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , each of which acts as an auxiliary detector , not of the incoming light but of the output of @xmath143 .",
    "the flip - flops @xmath144 and @xmath145 are clocked at a time @xmath146 later than is @xmath143 .",
    "the experimental outcome consists of two binary components , one from @xmath144 and the other from @xmath145 .",
    "if after the waiting time @xmath146 the output of @xmath143 is still teetering , the flip - flops @xmath144 and @xmath145 can differ , one registering a 1 while the other registers a 0 ; the disagreement between the two flip - flops registers the teetering of the output of @xmath143 . the measured relative frequency of disagreements between @xmath144 and @xmath145 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "we want to model the teetering statistics that we will use to discriminate among various sources of weak signals .",
    "traditional analyses of solid - state detecting devices and their flip - flops invoke quantum mechanics only to determine parameters for classical stories involving voltage and current .",
    "analyzed that way , teetering in a photo - diode - based detector that employs a flip - flop made of transistors arises in two ways : first , there can be teetering in the entry of electrons and holes into the conduction band of the photo - diode ; second , there can be teetering in the response of @xmath143 to whatever amplified pulse comes from the photo - diode .",
    "although both these teeterings involve electrons and holes going into a conduction band , the statistical spread of outputs for a given state is blamed on _ noise _ unconnected with the signal , and known analyses of a flip - flop invoke _ noise _ to evade the embarrassment of a possible infinite hesitation .    avoiding the invocation of ` noise , ' we picture @xmath143 quantum mechanically as a pair of probe particles .",
    "light acting via the transducer applies a force to the two probe particles .",
    "this scattering process transforms an initially prepared state of the light and probes to an out - state consisting of a sum ( or integral ) of products , each of which has a factor for the light and a factor for the two probe particles of @xmath143 .",
    "after some waiting time of evolution @xmath146 , the two probe particles are measured , as expressed by a resolution of the identity that ignores the signal state ; thus the probabilities of theoretical outcomes of the detection after the interaction are expressible by a reduced density operator obtained by tracing over the signal states . in this view , teetering shows up in the probability of detecting the two probe particles on different sides of a reference ; we will show how this probability depends on both the signal detected and a waiting time @xmath146 , and how in this dependence planck s constant enters .",
    "in the model presented here , we simplify the effect of the signal state to that of preparing , at time 0 , a pair of probe - particle wave functions . for simplicity ,",
    "the probe - particle wave functions have only one space dimension .",
    "let @xmath147 be the space coordinate for one probe particle and @xmath148 be the space coordinate for the other .",
    "the difference between one possible signal state and another is reflected by concentrating the initial probe - state wave functions slightly to one side or the other of an energy hump centered at the origin @xmath149 , @xmath150 .",
    "( as might be expected , teetering is most pronounced in the borderline case of a signal state that puts the initial probe - particle wave functions evenly over the energy hump . )",
    "we model the flip - flop @xmath144 as a resolution of the identity that has an theoretical outcome of 1 for @xmath151 and 0 for @xmath152 ; similarly @xmath145 is modeled as a resolution of the identity for @xmath148 .",
    "thus the two - component theoretical outcomes are 00 for @xmath153 ; 01 for @xmath154 , @xmath155 ; 10 for @xmath156 , @xmath157 ; and 11 for @xmath158 . by assuming a coupling between the two probe particles",
    ", we will model how increasing the waiting until time @xmath146 to detect the probe particles decreases the probability of disagreement between @xmath144 and @xmath145 , _ i.e._diminishes the probability of @xmath147 and @xmath148 being measured with different signs .",
    "thinking of the @xmath147-probe particle as a wave - function concentrated near an energy hump , assuming that the long - time behavior of the particle depends only on the hump curvature , and for the moment neglecting coupling between the two probe particles , we express the dynamics of the @xmath147-particle by the schrdinger equation for an unstable oscillator : @xmath159 where the instability comes from the minus sign in the term proportional to @xmath160 .",
