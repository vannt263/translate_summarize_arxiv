    "an important difference between the gc formation sites and normal star - forming regions is that a large amount of gas needs to be accumulated and collapse on a short timescale in the former case .",
    "if the gas accretion onto the cloud occurs very slowly compared to star formation , only a small fraction of the gas would achieve the high pressure and it may not form a typical , massive gc with @xmath12 before stellar feedback suppresses star formation . in this case , subsequent gas accretion after the initial burst of star formation is likely to lead to extended star formation histories , as in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "on the other hand , the origin of metal - poor gcs has been highly debated .",

    "in figure  [ fig : pic ] , we present the evolution of gas structures and the formation of two gc systems in atomic - cooling dmhs ( @xmath59 ) at high redshift ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "this may be summarized by five different evolutionary stages .",
    "( 1 ) when the halo mass is so small that its virial temperature is lower than @xmath61 , the gas in the mini - halo of primordial composition can not cool through ly @xmath4 emission and , thus , remains rather diffuse ( @xmath62 ) ( adiabatic phase ) .",
    "( 2 ) once a dmh becomes more massive than the transition mass @xmath63 through smooth accretion or halo mergers , the virial temperature of the halo exceeds @xmath61 and the gas in the central region of the halo collapses nearly isothermally with the aid of strong ly@xmath4 cooling ( panels a and e ) .",
    "because the halo gas carries angular momentum generated by the large - scale tidal torque , the collapse leads to the formation of a dense , disc - like structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( isothermal cooling phase ) .",
    "( 3 ) as the density of the disc becomes very high ( @xmath64 ) , its gas is turned efficiently into stars on a very short timescale ( @xmath65 ) . during this stage , early sne ( @xmath66 )",
    "provide newly synthesized metals to the surrounding medium .",
    "the metals enhance radiative cooling in the star - forming disc , resulting in gas fragmentation ( panels b and f ) .",
    "we find that roughly half of the stars ( 56 and 50% , respectively ) in the simulated gcs form in the fragmented clumps ( panel g ) ( self - enrichment and fragmentation phase ) .",
    "( 4 ) a large number of sn explosions ( @xmath67 ) ensue , clearing out the star - forming clouds and gas in the central region of the halo ( panel c ) ( outflow phase ) .",
    "( 5 ) subsequent star formation is quenched for at least one hundred myr , and star clusters at the center of the halo quickly merge into a single cluster .",

    "first , the mass of the simulated gcs ( @xmath71 for both halos ) is comparable to the local gcs @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the stars in these systems are unaffected by tidal stripping and simply evolve to @xmath70 , their @xmath69-band magnitudes would also be consistent with observations ( figure  [ fig : size ] ) .",
    "here we compute the @xmath69 band flux assuming a kroupa imf with a low- ( high- ) mass cut - off of 0.1 ( 100 )  @xcite .",
    "second , the simulated gcs are found to be very compact . when mergers of several clusters are completed and form a single massive cluster , the three - dimensional half - light radius is 0.54 and 0.86 pc , respectively .",
    "although the size of the simulated clusters is approximately a factor of 35 smaller than the observational estimates ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we note that subsequent dynamical evolutions through binary interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or mass loss are likely to increase the size of the systems . in a similar context",
    ", @xcite suggests that the initial size of the local compact gcs is likely to be less than 1pc ( c.f .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that each simulated cluster is formed in a single burst of star formation ( @xmath65 ) ( figure  [ fig : sfh ] ) , roughly consistent with the fact that a gc is essentially an ssp 10 myr if the effect of radiation feedback was stronger . due to the lack of cooling agents in our primordial halos , the temperature of the star - forming gas does not drop far below @xmath67 k , and",
    "the external pressure around the star - forming cloud is over - estimated .",
    "as a result , hii bubbles are confined by the surroundings and can not drive outflows in our simulation . including",
    "relevant cooling processes by molecular hydrogen and metals produced by pop iii / ii stars will decrease the temperature of the star - forming regions and result in an enhanced photoionization feedback before sne explode .",
    "this is likely to reduce the star formation timescale , which will be more compatible with the age spreads found in the local young massive clusters ( @xmath2 3 myr ) . ] .",
    "note that such a sharp truncation in star formation is driven by efficient sn feedback .",

    ", width=302 ]    although the predicted size and mass are comparable with their local counterparts , we find that the simulated gcs show a wide spread in metallicities .",
    "the mass - weighted mean metallicity of the two gc candidates ( 0.006 and 0.012 @xmath73 ) is close to that of the local metal - poor populations , but the metallicity of individual star particles is found to range from zero to a tenth of solar ( figure  [ fig : met ] ) .",
    "such a large dispersion is not unexpected because our simulations start from zero metallicity .",
    "yet it is interesting to note that the fraction of the extremely metal - poor population ( @xmath74 ) is significant ( 5060% ) in contrast to the standard interpretation that a gc is rather a chemically homogeneous system @xcite .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that , in simulations , a large fraction of gas is converted into stars before the first sn emerges and pollutes the star - forming gas . moreover , as metals from sne are dispersed locally and some of sne exploding on the outskirt of star - forming clouds can simply escape from them , we find that the metal enrichment occurs in a very inhomogeneous fashion .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : metfig ] shows that the second massive star - forming cloud ( upper giant cloud in the first panel ) is at least an order of magnitude more metal - poor than the central gas clump .",
    "however , it should be noted that the metallicity distributions may not necessarily rule out the dmh - based scenario , because pre - enrichment by pop iii and ii stars can reduce the metallicity spread by effectively regulating the self - enrichment via radiation feedback .",
    "it is also possible that the inclusion of turbulent metal mixing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that is not fully resolved in this study would suppress the formation of high- and low - metallicity stars .",
    "we discuss a role of pre - enrichment by the first generation stars and metal mixing as a potential solution to this problem in the next section .",
    "using cosmological radiation hydrodynamic simulations , we show that a massive and compact star cluster can form at the center of a dmh during the transition from molecular - cooling to atomic - cooling halos , provided that gas is primordial and atomic .",
    "because gas collapse occurs isothermally under such conditions , a large fraction of the gaseous disc with very high density turns into stars before sne disrupt the star - forming clouds . during this stage ,",
    "the gaseous disc is fragmented and stars form in each clump due to self - enrichment from early sne commencing at 3 myr , unlike the picture of black hole seed formation in which gas simply collapses onto au scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the resulting star clusters are found to have similar physical properties ( size and mass ) to the local gc populations , except for metallicity spread and the possibly related star - formation timescale .",
    "the most critical assumption in this scenario is that gas is primordial and atomic so that cooling due to molecular hydrogen and subsequent star formation does not prevent a large amount of gas from accumulating in the central region of the halo to form a gc .",
    "this may be achieved by having a strong lyman - werner background radiation that photo - dissociates molecular hydrogen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , we argue that even with cooling due to molecular hydrogen or metals produced by neighboring galaxies , it may still be possible to form a dense cluster , provided that pop iii or pop ii populations effectively regulate gas accretion .",
    "if gas is allowed to collapse in mini - halos via molecular hydrogen cooling and form pop iii stars @xcite , sn explosions and radiation feedback may expel a large fraction of the halo gas , suppressing star formation . if stellar feedback is energetic enough , subsequent major gas collapse is likely to occur when a large amount of gas is available and radiative cooling becomes significant , i.e. , when the halo mass becomes close to the atomic - cooling regime . even in the case where the recovery timescale of gas accretion is short due to weak feedback from pop iii stars ,",
    "the first generation of pop ii stars can in principle blow away the interstellar medium without constituting the gc population if the ensuing collapse of gas does not occur exactly inside the first pop ii stars ( kimm et al .",
    "2016 , in prep . ) . given that pop iii stars can pre - enrich the halo gas to @xmath75 @xcite and halos with a few times @xmath76 are likely to produce @xmath77 of metals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it can also help to alleviate the metallicity spread found in our simulation , possibly explaining the helium enhancement observed in some gcs @xcite .",
    "we note that the dmh - based scenario may be able to accommodate the observed number of blue gcs if a significant fraction of dmhs forms a gc during the transition from molecular - cooling to atomic - cooling regime .",
    "to estimate the _ maximum _ frequency , we generate halo merger trees for the volume of @xmath78 using the monte carlo algorithm based on the extended press schechter theory @xcite .",
    "we adopt the same cosmological parameters as described in section  2 and a mass resolution of @xmath79 .",
    "then the number of halos that first cross the transition mass ( @xmath80 ) is computed throughout the merger history in each halo .",
    "we find that the resulting frequency is @xmath81 .",
    "thus , for a milky way hosting halo of mass @xmath82 , the dmh - based formation scenario can predict the number of gcs up to six times more than the number of the local metal - poor population ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or an order of magnitude larger stellar masses associated with gc systems per dark matter halo mass @xcite .",
    "the large number of gcs may seem inconsistent with the local values , but it should be noted that the actual abundance at @xmath70 is likely to be lower than the maximum estimate for several reasons .",
    "it is known that the gc system can be reduced or disrupted by two - body relaxation - driven , tidally limited evaporation @xcite , disc and bulge shocks @xcite , and tidal shocks by giant molecular clouds in the disc @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the system ends up as a nuclear star cluster instead of a gc , given that it is embedded in the central region of a dmh .",
    "more importantly , not all of the dark matter halos may host a gc if gas accretion takes place rather continuously due to the inefficient explosion of the first generation stars and form a dwarf galaxy . in this regard , we argue that the large maximum frequency of gcs simply indicates that the dmh - based scenario can easily accommodate the abundance of local blue gcs .    finally , it should be mentioned that the dmh - based scenario may be ruled out if overall metal enrichment from the first generation stars ( i.e. pop iii and pop ii ) or external stellar sources @xcite is not sufficient enough to reach the typical metallicity of metal - poor gcs ( @xmath83 ) . as shown in figures 4 and 5 , the self - enrichment by stars in the simulated gcs is highly inhomogeneous and leads to a wide stellar metallicity distribution of @xmath84 , in contradiction to the observed metallicity spread @xcite .",
    "part of the large spread may be caused by the neglect of turbulent metal mixing that is not fully captured in our simulation due to limited resolution .",
    "the inclusion of explicit turbulent metal mixing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is likely to spread out the metal from highly enriched regions ( @xmath85 ) and increase the metallicity in metal - poor regions .",
    "however , the mixing alone may not be able to solve the metallicity problem , given that low - metallicity stars would still form before the first sne explode and enrich the interstellar medium . instead",
    ", we note that pre - enrichment by pop iii and ii stars can significantly reduce the metallicity spread by removing the low - metallicity tail .",
    "this pre - enrichment , along with the cooling by molecular hydrogen , can also effectively suppress the formation of high - metallicity stars for the following reason .",
    "due to the lack of cooling agents in our primordial halos , we find that the temperature of star - forming gas does not drop far below 8000k during the early stage of star formation , making the external gas pressure in the star - forming regions too high .",
    "this leads to an underestimation of the effect of photoionization feedback , because the hii region is no longer an over - pressurized bubble and can not generate enough momentum to disperse gas clouds on a very short time scale of a few myr @xcite . however , including the relevant cooling processes by metal and molecular hydrogen will lower the temperature of the star - forming region , and the inner pressure from hii regions will be able to drive outflows and suppress star formation before newly synthesized metals from type ii sne ejecta is recycled to star - forming clumps .",
    "thus , the metallicity problem may be solved by taking into account pop iii stars and relevant cooling processes . in this case",
    ", the self - enrichment process will be limited accordingly , and one would require the pre - enrichment of metals that closely match those of local blue gcs . if a wide range of pre - enrichment by pop iii stars is real ( @xmath75 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and only a fraction of the metal ejecta from the first pop ii stars is recycled due to outflows , an important question would then be why gc formation is efficient only in regions with @xmath86 .",
