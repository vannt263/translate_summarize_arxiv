    "neutrino masses play an important role in different areas of physics ranging from nuclear to high energy physics or astrophysics . up to date , however , we only know upper bounds to their values and their determination remains an outstanding problem in physics .",
    "one of the most promising procedures to unravel the effective mass of the electronic ( anti)neutrino is to study the electronic energy spectrum in the @xmath0-decay , where the maximum energy allowed to the electron depends on the mass of the ( anti)neutrinos ( in what follows we will not differentiate between the masses of neutrino and antineutrino , as we assume an exact cpt symmetry ) .",
    "however , the ratio of the effective electron - neutrino mass @xmath1 to the electron mass @xmath2 is very small , @xmath3 ( @xcite -@xcite ) , and the probability of emission of the electron depends at least quadratically on this quotient .",
    "this implies that the spectrum of the emitted electrons is very little affected by the value of @xmath1 . only near the end point of the spectrum , where the energy of the emitted antineutrino is close to @xmath4",
    ", there is a stronger dependence in the neutrino mass as the highest energy of the electron varies linearly with @xmath4 .",
    "this adds new difficulties to measure the neutrino mass in @xmath0-decay , since one must explore the region very near the end point , where the occurrence of an event has a very small probability .    for these reasons",
    ", it is important to find new strategies to analyse the data with higher sensitivity in this part of the electron spectrum .",
    "this goal can be achieved with the help of the extreme value theory ( evt ) for random variables of compact support @xcite , as it is described below .",
    "evt studies the probability distribution of the maximum of @xmath5 independent , identically distributed random variables ( @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "its interest in connection to the problem of determining the neutrino mass is clear if one considers that , as mentioned before , the influence of the neutrino mass on the energy distribution of the electronic emission , is maximal at the upper bound .",
    "then , if we focus on the electrons emitted with the highest energy among @xmath5 emissions we should expect a deeper insight of the region near the upper bound of the spectrum . in the next sections we will introduce the main tools in evt and we will present quantitative results for the tritium @xmath0-decay showing the enhancement in the sensitivity of the experiment .",
    "let us consider a normalised probability density @xmath6 with support in @xmath7 $ ] , i.e. @xmath8 if @xmath9 $ ] , and @xmath10 its cumulative distribution function : @xmath11 the distribution function of the maximum of @xmath5 independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables with probability density @xmath6 is then : @xmath12 as it can be easily argued . in fact , note that @xmath10 represents the probability of the random variable taking a value smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the probability of @xmath5 i.i.d .",
    "random variables taking all of them a value smaller than @xmath13 is the @xmath5th power of the former @xcite . hence , the probability density is : @xmath14    we are interested in the large @xmath5 limit where it is evident that @xmath15 squeezes at the end point @xmath16 independently of the initial probability density ( provided @xmath16 is in the support of @xmath17 ) .",
    "therefore , we lose any sign of the initial distribution .    a way to overcome this situation is to renormalise , at every step , the random variable .",
    "as it is shown in @xcite a convenient renormalisation is to transform the variable @xmath13 into @xmath18 .",
    "this transformation has the virtue of preserving the support @xmath7 $ ] , which means that the new random variable @xmath19 takes the same range of values as the original one .",
    "also , if we chose the appropriate @xmath0 , the limit of infinite @xmath5 provides a non trivial probability distribution .",
    "the problem of choosing the appropriate value for @xmath0 was addressed in @xcite using renormalisation group techniques .",
    "there it is shown that @xmath0 depends solely on the behaviour of @xmath6 in the vicinity of @xmath16 more specifically , assuming that @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 in order to have a normalisable density ) the appropriate transformation is implemented with @xmath22 .",
    "once the right transformation has been chosen one can safely take the large @xmath5 limit of @xmath23 , namely : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and , as shown in @xcite , the limit of probabilities distributions should be understood in the weak sense ( or in law ) . to derive the result in [ limdis ]",
    "it is enough to realise that the large @xmath5 limit corresponds to a fixed point of the renormalisation group transformation , i.e it should satisfy @xmath26 in terms of the function @xmath27 the previous equation reads @xmath28 which implies that @xmath29 is homogeneous of degree @xmath30 and therefore [ limdis ] follows ( the coefficient @xmath31 can be obtained from the behaviour of @xmath10 at @xmath16 ) .    observe that the limiting probability distribution depends only on the two parameters @xmath30 and @xmath32 that determine the behaviour of @xmath17 at the maximum of its support .",
    "all other details of the initial distribution are swept out .",
    "note also that the limit in ( [ limdis ] ) is related to the frchet distribution by changing to the variable @xmath33 .",
    "the latter distribution is one of the possible limits in the gnedenko s extreme value theorem @xcite .",
    "if we had considered a different rescaling ( @xmath34 ) then the probability density , in the limit of infinite @xmath5 , would have been trivial in the sense that it accumulates either at @xmath35 or at @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , in this case we have @xmath37 with @xmath38 the heaviside step function .",
    "it should be stressed that these completely opposite limits hold only if @xmath5 goes strictly to @xmath39 which , of course , is not attainable experimentally .",
    "however , one expects that when @xmath5 is large enough ( in the sense that we will precise in the next section ) the renormalised distribution depends critically on its behaviour at the maximum of its support .",
    "these properties are key to our purposes , due to the fact that the energy spectrum of the electron emitted in the @xmath0 decay changes drastically at the upper limit depending whether the neutrino is massless or not .",
    "namely , if the neutrino were massless the probability density for the electronic energy would behave like @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) . on the other hand , if it were massive the behaviour would be @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that the sensitivity of the experiment to the neutrino mass should be very much enhanced when the results are analysed with the tools provided by evt .",
    "in this section we shall apply the previous ideas to the specific problem of determining the neutrino mass in @xmath0-decay experiments .",
    "although the method is general , we will focus on the @xmath0-decay of tritium .",
    "this process is specially suited for the purpose of determining the neutrino mass for two reasons .",
    "first , it is a super allowed decay ( @xmath44 years of half - live ) and , consequently , the nuclear matrix element does not depend on the energy of the emitted electron .",
    "second , it has a relatively low end point energy , which increases the sensitivity of the experiment to the neutrino mass ( see @xcite for a review on the neutrino mass limit from the tritium beta decay ) .",
    "the probability of emission of an electron , with total energy @xmath45 ranging from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , is given by @xmath48^{1/2 } , \\label{rho}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is a normalisation constant , @xmath50 the total available energy , i. e. @xmath51 with @xmath52 the end point energy , and @xmath53 is related to the fermi function which accounts for the interaction with the nuclear coulomb field . in the case of atomic tritium",
    "we shall take @xmath54 kev @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath55 that appears in [ rho ] is , actually , the squared effective mass of the electron antineutrino , which should be expressed in terms of the weighted average of the mass eigenstates @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) as @xmath58 being @xmath59 the weights known from the neutrino oscillation experiments . for the sake of clarity we have neglected in ( [ rho ] ) the sum over final states",
    "this does not affect the conclusions and it can be implemented numerically .",
    "it will be convenient to introduce dimensionless , rescaled variables for the electron kinetic energy and the neutrino mass .",
    "namely , define @xmath60 and the probability density in terms of @xmath13 is @xmath61^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the new normalisation constant and @xmath64 . now by monitoring the energy of the electrons in the @xmath0-decay of tritium we could estimate the probability density @xmath17 and deduce the value of @xmath65 .",
    "the problem is that , as we mentioned before , the dominant correction to the limit of zero neutrino mass goes like @xmath66 @xcite and , given the small upper bound value for @xmath67 , the corrections due to the mass of the neutrino are very small .",
    "as we shall see , the evt for @xmath5 events provides an enhancement of the correction by a factor @xmath68 making it easier to detect .",
    "the experimental set up should focus on the electron of highest energy among @xmath5 decays .",
    "that is , given a set of data corresponding to @xmath5 decays , we keep only those corresponding to the emitted electron with the maximum energy ; we call this event an extreme value decay . repeating this selection process @xmath69 times over different sets of @xmath5",
    "decays , we can obtain the distribution function for the extreme value decays @xmath70 and from it @xmath71 which can be fitted to the rescaled limit distribution ( [ limdis ] ) obtained for a given value of @xmath1 ( or equivalently with @xmath72 ) . note that the total number of disintegrations needed is @xmath73 .",
    "the number @xmath5 of decays that we consider at each step can be determined if we know how many atoms of tritium we have in the sample and the time spent recording the energy of the emitted electrons .",
    "moreover , we do not have to register all the @xmath5 events , because as we are finally interested in the highest energy emitted electron , a very stringent cut - off can considerably reduce the number of decays that one has to analyse .    at present , the katrin experiment @xcite is planned to operate with a @xmath74 bq .",
    "source and a running time of @xmath75 years that gives a total number of @xmath76 decays , then a reasonable choice for an evt analysis would be @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 $ ] . in what follows",
    "we shall use @xmath79 as a realistic value , this implies that we can record an extreme event every @xmath75 seconds .",
    "the cumulative distribution for the highest energy events is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the cumulative distribution function for the probability density in ( [ density ] ) . in order to get a non trivial limit ( in the case of zero neutrino mass )",
    "we shall rescale the variable and define @xmath82 . to estimate the size of the corrections due to the non zero neutrino mass we first expand @xmath17 in powers of @xmath65 , @xmath83 where @xmath84\\frac{q^{-1}f(x)}2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath85 and @xmath86 then the cumulative distribution @xmath81 can be similarly written @xmath87 for the moment",
    "we do not specify the concrete form of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "now we can easily expand the logarithm of @xmath90 : @xmath91 where the dots represent subdominant contributions for large @xmath5 and small @xmath65 and we have used @xmath92 . therefore , taking the large @xmath5 limit ( with @xmath93 ) in the arguments of @xmath94 and @xmath95 and exponentiating the previous expression we obtain @xmath96 where @xmath97 and , given the relation between @xmath81 and @xmath17 , we have @xmath98 .    the expansion for the probability density is obtained by taking the derivative of ( [ expansion ] ) and it reads @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the probability density in the limit of zero neutrino mass , i.e. @xmath101    the expressions above are valid provided @xmath102 with @xmath103 which is the real situation , given the actual upper bounds for @xmath104 and the accessible experimental values for @xmath5 ( of the order of @xmath105 , as we have seen before)(@xcite-@xcite ) . if we had considered the large @xmath5 limit in a more strict sense , @xmath102 and @xmath106 , the results would have changed and the difference between the massless and massive case would have been more dramatic .",
    "in fact , after performing the appropriate rescaling , we would have obtained for _ very _ large @xmath5 : @xmath107 however , as we argued before , in the present situation this limit is not attainable .",
    "therefore , we shall restrict ourselves to the case when @xmath108 using the expression ( [ expansion ] ) for @xmath109 .    in our analysis of the tritium @xmath0-decay",
    "we address the possibility of measuring a neutrino mass of the order @xmath110 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show a comparison between the exact values of @xmath109 for @xmath111 and for @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "we also show the curve obtained using the perturbative expansion ( [ expansion ] ) with @xmath114 .",
    "we can see there that the perturbative expansion fits well with the exact value .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the cumulative distribution @xmath109 for @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 ev .",
    "note that for this value of @xmath5 , the distributions corresponding to @xmath118 ev and @xmath116 are clearly separated .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we compare the probability distribution @xmath119 for @xmath115 and different values of @xmath1 .",
    "the graph illustrates how the bound on the neutrino mass , for this @xmath5 , can be lowered by one order of magnitude with respect to its present value .",
    "however , it would be very difficult to go one order of magnitude further , as it would imply to increase @xmath5 by a factor @xmath120 .",
    "we end our discussion by studying the expectation value of the variable @xmath121 , that is also sensitive to the neutrino mass . in this case",
    "we also discuss how the precision in the measurement of the electronic energy affects the determination of the neutrino mass .",
    "we have : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the mean value for @xmath116 . in our case @xmath124 and the dots mean corrections of order @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "assume now an indetermination @xmath127 in the measurement of the electronic energy , this is related to the indetermination of the neutrino mass ( @xmath65 in the adimensional variables ) by the following expression , @xmath128 which one easily gets from ( [ expectation ] ) , therefore , assuming @xmath129 ev , we can determine it , in an individual measurement , within @xmath130 of relative precision provided the energy resolution is @xmath131ev and @xmath132 ( an account every 200 seconds in an experiment with @xmath74 bq ) .",
    "this estimates are close to the values that are expected from future experiments @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we briefly presented the main tools of extreme value statistics for distributions of compact support .",
    "a subject that can be useful for analysing the electron spectrum in the @xmath0-decay of tritium , in order to determine an upper limit for the electronic neutrino . actually , the main difference in the spectrum with a massive or a massless neutrino is its behaviour at the tail of the distribution , a region that can be deeply explored thanks to the extreme value theory .",
    "we have performed an analytic study of the expectation variable of the renormalised energy of the fastest emitted electron among @xmath5 disintegrations .",
    "we have shown that the expectation variable depends linearly on @xmath133 and we have determined the coefficients . in this way",
    "we show that the dependence on the square mass of the neutrino ( in dimensionless units ) @xmath66 is enhanced by the factor @xmath68 , which increases the sensitivity of the experiment .",
    "for instance , in the present experimental facilities , we can reach @xmath134 , which means that neutrino mass upper bounds of the order of @xmath135 ev could be obtained . in conclusion",
    ", we believe that extreme value theory can be useful to analyse the electronic energy spectrum in @xmath0-decay and it is worth implementing in present and future experiments .",
    "the extreme value theory can be used for distributions that are not iid . in this case the so - called extremal index should be introduced . see for example p. embrechts , c. klppelberg , and t. mikosch , _ modelling extremal events for insurance and finance _ ( springer , berlin , 1997 ) , isbn 978 - 3 - 642 - 33483 - 2 ."
