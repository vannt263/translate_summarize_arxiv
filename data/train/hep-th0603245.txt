    "@xmath4-branes living at the singularity of a @xmath5 cone have provided general results for gauge / gravity correspondence since its early days .",
    "the @xmath6 limit of the gauge theory on the world volume of the @xmath4-branes is dual to type @xmath7 string theory on the near horizon geometry @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the base of the cone : the horizon manifold @xcite .",
    "since the cone is @xmath5 , @xmath9 is sasaki - einstein ; the classical manifolds that admit a sasaki - einstein metric are @xmath10 ( the original manifold of the correspondence ) , @xmath11 ( the base of the conifold ) , and their quotients @xcite .",
    "+ recently , infinite classes of new sasaki - einstein metrics have been constructed @xcite and named @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the corresponding dual gauge theories have been determined @xcite .",
    "thanks to recent developments in the correspondence @xcite in particular when the @xmath5 cone is a toric manifold @xcite , the explicit knowledge of the @xmath5 metric is not so important for the construction of the dual gauge theories and for checks on the correspondence ( @xmath12-maximization and @xmath13-minimization ) @xcite .",
    "in particular nowadays we have an algorithm that in principle allows us to construct the quiver gauge theories dual to all possible toric singularities @xcite .",
    "the interesting fact is that the correspondence can be extended to the non - conformal case . indeed",
    "if there are some topologically non - trivial two cycles in the base of the @xmath5 cones a simple way to break conformal invariance is to introduce fractional branes at their tip .",
    "physically they correspond to @xmath14-branes wrapped on two cycles collapsed at the singularity . at the level of the quiver ,",
    "fractional branes correspond to rank assignments for nodes in the quiver , which are consistent with cancellation of non - abelian anomalies . in the presence of a large number @xmath15 of @xmath4-branes , a small amount @xmath16 of @xmath4 fractional branes leads to a controlled breaking of conformal invariance , yielding field theories with tractable supergravity duals . in many cases ,",
    "the field theory @xmath17 flow is known to lead to a cascade of seiberg dualities in which the effective number of @xmath4-branes decreases , while that of fractional branes remains constant @xcite .",
    "this flow tells us that the @xmath6 dynamics is dominated by the field theories on the fractional branes , in absence of @xmath4-branes .",
    "recently the supergravity solutions in the non - conformal case for the entire family of @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been constructed @xcite .",
    "hence it is really interesting to understand the exact dynamics of the field theories on fractional branes . in the cases of toric singularities",
    "it seems easy to classify the @xmath6 dynamics of the gauge field theories : just looking at the toric diagram we can understand the types of fractional branes that the geometry admits .",
    "the number of possible fractional branes is equal to the number of non - trivial two cycles in the five dimensional manifold @xmath9 .",
    "this is equal to the number of non - trivial three cycles that is the number of points on the boundary in the toric diagram minus three .",
    "the types of fractional branes are divided into three classes related to the characteristic of the toric diagram @xcite :    * toric diagrams with points on the boundary of the polygon @xmath18 @xmath19 fractional branes : the gauge field theories on these branes have enhanced supersymmetry * toric diagrams that can be decomposed in minkowski sums of polytopes @xmath18 deformation fractional branes : the gauge field theories on these branes confine in the @xmath6 * diagrams without points on the boundary or complex deformations , or generic composition of the previous two categories of fractional branes @xmath18 supersymmetry breaking ( @xmath20 ) fractional branes : the gauge theories on these branes break supersymmetry    one interesting class of such dynamics is given by the deformation fractional branes @xcite .",
    "geometries dual to these branes admit deformations and may allow the construction of a supergravity solution of the @xmath21 type @xcite",
    ". some particular classes of these type of geometries are given by the generalized conifold and in particular by the @xmath22 singularity and it is an interesting subject to try to deform the singular metric for the construction of a complete regular supergravity solution . + clearly",
    "the most interesting one also for phenomenological reasons is the last type .",
    "the possibility of a gauge theory , with gravity dual , which at the end of its flow in the @xmath6 breaks dynamically the supersymmetry is certainly an interesting subject .",
    "the point is that the distinction between a stable non supersymmetric vacuum and runaway behaviour is not clear from the geometry .",
    "it seems that branes related to the third class of fractional branes break in some sense supersymmetry , but it is not clear whether supersymmetry is in some way restored at infinity or there can be any stable non - supersymmetric vacuum .",
    "some cases were recently discussed in @xcite and it seems that the general behaviour is runaway @xcite .",
    "the complete calculation of the @xmath6 dynamics for the specific case of @xmath23 theory was done in @xcite confirming the general belief .",
    "+ the proposal of this work is to give arguments in favour of this runaway behaviour for the complete class of @xmath0 and some examples of @xmath1 singularities .",
    "we will work in the framework of field theories with gauge group given by a product of @xmath24 factors , because we consider the theories on the @xmath25-brane at low energy , where the @xmath26 factors are massive and thus decoupled .",
    "our aim is to show that in the cases under consideration it is always possible to find a gauge - invariant baryonic classically flat direction containing elementary fields which are sent to infinity by non - perturbative effects .",
    "this automatically solves the @xmath25-term equations of the field theory @xcite and gives hints towards the existence of runaway behavior for all these theories .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility that some effects from the non - chiral sector of the action ( i.e. , the khler potential ) may lead to a stabilization of this runaway mode is still left open , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section [ generalypq ]",
    "we give a brief review of @xmath0 geometry and the dual gauge theory . here",
    "we explain the structure of the theory in the conformal and the non - conformal regime . in section [ cascades ]",
    "we discuss how to perform seiberg dualities in the framework of the dimer technology .",
    "we describe the general structure of the @xmath17 flow for @xmath0 theories and we recast the known results on cascades for @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the dimer language ; further , we construct the periodic structure of the coupling constant flow for these two subclasses . moreover , some self - similar pattern of seiberg dualities for the general case is explicitly derived : we point out how the correspondence between symmetries of the dimer and periodicity of the coupling constant flow under seiberg duality appears to be more difficult to find in full generality . in section [ dsbrun ]",
    "we give a short review of the @xmath29 and runaway behavior for these classes of gauge theories dual to toric cone .",
    "we discuss also some examples known in literature of quiver gauge theories with infrared `` @xmath20 '' . in section [ ypqdimer ]",
    "we start the analysis of the low energy structure for the whole @xmath0 family , finding out the general pattern for the appearance of non - perturbative affleck - dine - seiberg terms in the effective superpotential from the study of the brane tiling representation of these theories .",
    "this is further carried over in section [ ypqir ] , where the analysis of the @xmath30-terms suggests that the behavior of the entire @xmath0 class is runaway .",
    "in fact we find that it is always possible to construct a classically flat baryonic direction that is lifted to a runaway direction by non - perturbative effects .",
    "finally , in section [ beyondypq ] we outline how this probable scenario may be likely reproduced for @xmath1 dual gauge theories using some examples .",
    "clearly here the family is huge and really complicated , and something different may happen .",
    "we hope to return to the general case of dimer gauge theories and toric geometry correspondence in the class of @xmath20 fractional branes in future work .",
    "the @xmath0 manifolds are an infinite class of five dimensional sasaki - einstein manifolds parameterized by two integers @xmath31 that satisfy the relation , @xmath32 types of manifolds ; the first ones correspond to @xmath33 quotients of the conifold and admit complex deformations that are dual to confining gauge theories , while the second ones are orbifolds of flat space and the dual non - conformal gauge theories will be of @xmath19 type . ]",
    "all these spaces have topology @xmath35 and their metrics have @xmath36 isometry .",
    "our starting point is to consider a real cone over these spaces @xmath37 .",
    "these are toric @xmath5 cones whose algebraic properties can be described by a toric diagram @xcite like in figure [ toricy52 ] .",
    "the @xmath5 condition tells us that the end points of the vectors in the lattice cone are all on a plane .",
    "this means that we can describe the geometry simply drawing a convex polygon on a plane .",
    "the generic algebraic singularity is given in fact by a four points toric diagram , with vertices given by : @xmath38     manifolds .",
    "( b ) the @xmath39-wed diagram of @xmath0 manifolds . in the figure",
    "we show the specific case of @xmath40    in this paper we will be interested in the study of the dual gauge theories that have no supersymmetric vacuum .",
    "the general feeling is that these theories are dual to geometries without complex deformations .",
    "the easiest way to understand if a toric singularity has complex deformation or not is to draw the @xmath39-web ( dual of the toric diagram ) and see if it is possible to split it into subwebs in equilibrium @xcite , that are subwebs made of a set of vectors whose sum is equal to zero ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is clearly not possible for the case in figure [ toricy52 ] ; hence , they do not admit deformation fractional branes .",
    "moreover , the generic toric diagram has no lattice points on the edges , and therefore the geometry does not admit @xmath19 fractional branes either . for these reasons",
    "they admit only `` @xmath20 '' fractional branes .",
    "now that we have understood the geometry , it is important to explain the dual gauge theory . to construct the gauge theory we put a stack of @xmath4-branes on the toric singularity transverse to the six dimensional @xmath5 geometry .",
    "the gauge theories which live on the worldvolume of the branes will be a superconformal @xmath41 quiver gauge theory whose peculiar characteristics are described by a dimer diagram @xcite .",
    "this is a set of white and black points together with a set of links which stretch only between points of different colours , drawn on a @xmath42 torus .",
    "this graph realizes a tiling of the torus in which every face corresponds to a gauge group , every link to a bifundamental chiral superfield which tranforms following the orientation given on the graph by the pattern of black and white points , and every point corresponds to a term in the superpotential which contains the chiral fields attached to the point and with the plus sign if the vertex is white and the minus sign if the vertex is black .",
    "note that the superpotential is a sum of positive and negative terms , with each field appearing exactly once in a positive term and once in a negative term .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that the vertices of the dimer are colored in black or white and links connect only vertices of different color .",
    "nowadays there exists an algorithm that allows to construct the dual quiver gauge theory starting from any toric singularity @xcite .",
    "the quiver gauge theories were originally derived in @xcite , but we will use the language of dimers and we will present the theories following the convention of @xcite . the gauge theories on @xmath0 have dimers built with @xmath43 hexagons and @xmath44 quadrilaterals , that can be obtained by dividing into two parts @xmath45 hexagons drawn below the first @xmath43 ones ( see figure [ kast ] ) .",
    "there is only one column of such hexagons and divided hexagons that are periodically identified in the vertical direction .",
    "the other @xmath42 periodicity is described by drawing other columns and identifying each face with the face in the right column shifted down by one position @xmath46 .",
    "the geometry is completely characterized by a pair of integer @xmath39 , while the gauge theory is given in terms of another pair of integers @xmath47 .",
    "these two pairs are related by the following equations : @xmath48 the numbers of gauge factors , terms in the superpotential and fields are given by @xmath49 \\",
    "# \\ , \\textrm{super potential } & 2\\,p + 2q & 2\\,(n+m)\\\\[0.5em ] \\ # \\ , \\textrm{fields } & 4\\,p + 2\\,q & 3\\,n+4\\,m\\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ]    ]    we are now in the conformal regime ; if we apply seiberg dualities to these quiver gauge theories we can obtain different quivers that flow in the @xmath6 to the same @xmath50 .",
    "it turns out that one can always find phases where all the gauge group factors have the same number of colors @xmath15 ; these are called toric phases . inside these toric phases",
    "we can find phases in which the number of chiral fields is equal to what we have written above .",
    "these special phases are called minimal toric phases , because they are the ones with a minimal number of fields .",
    "we shall consider here the theories only in minimal toric phases . in these cases",
    "the gauge group is : @xmath51 these theories have one @xmath52 global symmetry , one @xmath26 @xmath53-symmetry and one flavour @xmath26 symmetry corresponding to the isometries of the @xmath0 manifolds .",
    "the global symmetries in the gauge theory correspond on the supergravity side to massless gauge vectors in @xmath54 obtained by @xmath55 compactification on the compact submanifolds @xmath0 .",
    "inspecting the massless vectors we can find another @xmath26 factor .",
    "this is the baryonic symmetry and the corresponding gauge field comes from the reduction of the @xmath56 four form field of type @xmath7 supergravity on the non - trivial @xmath57 in @xmath0 .",
    "we can divide the chiral superfields in the theories in four classes :    * @xmath58 singlets @xmath13 fields . *",
    "@xmath59 singlets @xmath60 fields . *",
    "@xmath61 doublets @xmath62 fields .",
    "* @xmath63 doublets @xmath64 fields .    for us",
    "the important characteristic that distinguishes the four classes will be the baryonic charge ( see table [ bcharges ] ) .",
    ".charges under the baryonic symmetry . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     since in this paper our principal task is to describe the @xmath6 dynamics of the non - conformal theories dual to @xmath0 manifolds we have to find a way to escape from the conformal case . the classical way to accomplish",
    "this is to add to our theories a number @xmath16 of fractional branes .",
    "these correspond to @xmath14-branes wrapped on topologically non - trivial two cycles in the geometry that have vanishing volume .",
    "since the topology of smooth @xmath0 is @xmath65 we expect the existence of a single type of fractional brane we can add in order to obtain non - conformal theories .",
    "these @xmath14-branes are wrapped on the @xmath66 which is vanishing at the tip of the cone .",
    "the addition of @xmath16 fractional branes gives a theory with the same number of gauge groups , but with different number of colors @xmath67 and the same bi - fundamental fields as before .",
    "the numbers @xmath68 correspond to the unique assignment of gauge groups that lead to a non - anomalous theory .",
    "these numbers can be easily determined from the baryonic symmetry : the difference between the number of colors of gauge groups connected by a bi - fundamental is @xmath16 times the baryonic charge of the chiral field , with the convention that fields of opposite chirality contribute with opposite sign . as a practical recipe",
    ", one can start with a face in the tiling , assign to it a conventional number of colors @xmath15 , find the numbers in the adjacent faces using the previous rule and then continue until all numbers @xmath68 are determined .",
    "we will see some examples of the realization of this procedure in the next sections .",
    "the method works for the following reasons @xcite .",
    "first of all , the cancellation of all anomalies for the baryonic symmetry implies that the sum of charges for all the bi - fundamental fields starting from a given face must vanish @xmath69 this condition ensures that , with the previous assignment , all gauge groups are not anomalous .",
    "in addition , the fact that the baryonic symmetry is a combination of the @xmath26 factors in @xmath70 guarantees that the result is independent on the choice of path on the tiling used for determining the @xmath68 s .",
    "as explained in the previous section the addition of a well behaved set of fractional branes breaks conformal symmetry .",
    "in fact , as we have seen , in the field theory side this corresponds to change the rank of some of the gauge group factors and it is easy to see that this operation upsets the vanishing of the beta functions @xcite . in this situation",
    "we clearly have a non - trivial @xmath17 flow that is generically realized as duality cascade @xcite . in this section",
    "we want to study the @xmath17 flow for the non - conformal gauge theories dual to the @xmath0 manifolds in presence of fractional branes , deriving the general formulae for the beta functions and analyzing the cascades .",
    "the @xmath71 function of the @xmath72-th gauge factor of the theory is @xcite @xmath73 \\frac{g^3}{16 \\pi ^2}=- h \\frac{g^3}{16 \\pi ^2}\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all the chiral fields trasforming in the @xmath74 representation of the gauge group , and having anomalous dimension @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 is the casimir of the @xmath74 representation normalized such that @xmath77 and @xmath78 . because we have only bifundamental fields we can write @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the number of colours of the gauge group and @xmath81 the number of flavours .",
    "it is easy to understand that every quiver gauge theory dual to a @xmath0 manifold has only four different types of @xmath71 functions given by the four families of gauge factors in figure [ beta ] .        @xmath82    where @xmath83 are the baryonic charges of each field as given in the previous section .",
    "the non - trivial part of the @xmath71 functions is given by the term @xmath84 in ( [ betaf ] ) .",
    "we can compute them using the relations @xcite @xmath85 given by the fact that the superpotential has @xmath53-charge 2 , and the following relation between the @xmath53 charges and the anomalous dimensions @xmath86 by doing this we obtain @xmath87 because we will be interested in the leading order in @xmath88 ( `` near '' the conformal theory ) , we can use the conformal @xmath53-charges @xcite @xmath89 to compute the @xmath90 functions : @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath93 , where we have also used the explicit expressions for the baryonic charges ( see table [ bcharges ] ) .",
    "these relations satisfy the following inequalities : @xmath94 this means that in the @xmath0 gauge theories we always have two @xmath95-free families of gauge factors ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) and two @xmath6-free families ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) with opposite @xmath71 functions .      in this section",
    "we want to explain how a seiberg duality can be easily realized in the context of quiver gauge theories using dimer technology @xcite .",
    "a brane tiling is a bipartite graph in which we can consistently choose an orientation like in figure [ orient ] .",
    "this orientation assigns the representation ( fundamental or antifundamental ) to the chiral superfields in the quiver theory ( links ) . with this notion in mind",
    "we can describe a seiberg duality at a single gauge group ( face ) along the renormalization group flow in the following way :    * we consider a point in @xmath17 such that the dynamics of the other gauge groups is effectively decoupled ( all the other gauge couplings can be considered small compared to the one we are dualizing ) .",
    "this reduces the theory to the sqcd - like theory to which seiberg duality may be applied .",
    "* next , we draw inside the cut hexagon a smaller one , we link its vertices , coloured in a consistent way with the orientation , with the vertices of the older one and we erase its edges ( fig . [ sbdual ] ; see @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure reverses the link orientations , which is the dimer representation of the fact that the dual quarks transform under the conjugate representation to the original ones .",
    "the new links are the mesons @xmath100 of the seiberg duality and they interact with the dual quarks @xmath101 according to the new vertices in the brane tiling giving the usual terms @xmath102 .",
    "* now some of the new fields are massive ( terms in the superpotential given by a node with only two arrows ) , and we have to integrate them out , because we are interested in the low energy theory .",
    "the integrating out procedure graphically corresponds to erase the massive links and to make the identifications in figure [ sbdual ] .",
    "summarizing , for the types of quiver gauge theories considered in this paper , a seiberg duality is the local operation on the brane tiling shown in figure [ locsab ] .",
    "the tools developed in this section are very useful to understand the cascades in the context of very complicated quiver gauge theories as the ones dual to the @xmath0 manifolds .      in @xcite the cascades for the dual gauge theories to @xmath27 and @xmath28 manifolds are explained . using the dimer technology we can show in a simpler way the self - similar structure of the gauge theory under duality , which allows the cascade to occur .",
    "the case of @xmath27 is quite general : the theories have only one cut hexagon and @xmath103 regular hexagons . because we have only one gauge factor with the largest @xmath95-free @xmath71 function ( type @xmath96 ) we can choose the most generic initial conditions in which this factor ( that is also the one with the highest rank ) has the strongest gauge coupling . in the present situation this gauge coupling will run to infinity first and we have to apply the duality transformation to this gauge group factor if we want to continue the @xmath17 flow after this point .",
    "quiver gauge theories under seiberg duality ]    in figure [ ypp1sd ] the self - similar structure of the theory is evident .",
    "in fact we obtain the original theory if we relabel the gauge factors in the following way : [ relabypp1 ] 2p 2 2p-1 2p 2p-2 1 2p-3 2p-1 + 2p-4 2p-2 2p-5 2p-3  the net effect on the theory is the shift @xmath104 . at the next step",
    "we will need to dualize the `` new '' @xmath105 factor , and so on .",
    "the case of @xmath28 is less generic than the previous one because these theories have @xmath106 regular hexagons and @xmath107 cut hexagons .",
    "this means that a generic theory will have @xmath108 type @xmath96 beta functions and there may be different natural choices to realize the self - similar structure of the theory under @xmath17 flow .",
    "the easiest one is to choose the initial conditions such that the gauge group factor of highest rank flows to infinite coupling first , then after applying a duality transformation to this group and relabeling the group factor , we find exactly the same theory with @xmath109 .",
    "the procedure is shown in figure [ yp1sd ] .",
    "quiver gauge theories under seiberg duality . ]    in this case the relabeling is : @xmath110 at the next step we will need to dualize the `` new '' @xmath111 factor and so on .    until now we have shown possible self - similar patterns of gauge dualities , and we have justified them giving some arguments about the `` naturalness '' of the relative sizes of the gauge coupling constants . to show that such cascades really occur and that they are consistent with the renormalization group flow we must explicitly write down the possible pattern of initial data for the gauge coupling constants that allows us to use the conformal anomalous dimensions in the computation of the @xmath71 function . ] . in what follows",
    "we will use a graphical method : we will plot the @xmath17 flow for the coupling constants as a function of the logarithm of the energy @xmath112 : @xmath113 where @xmath16 is the @xmath95 starting point of the @xmath17 flow , @xmath114 is the energy scale along the flow , and @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",

    "the main support for the idea of cascading @xmath17 for the gauge theories associated to the @xmath0 singularities comes from the supergravity dual description @xcite .",
    "in fact it was found that the five form @xmath128 , whose integral over the @xmath0 manifolds gives the number @xmath15 of regular branes in the conformal case , acquires a radial dependence in presence of additional fractional branes that is a monotonically increasing function of the radius @xmath129 of the cone .",
    "considering the relation between the radial coordinate @xmath129 of the geometry and the energy @xmath130 of the dual gauge theory this means that going toward the @xmath6 ( small values of @xmath129 ) the number of effective regular @xmath4-branes decreases and this situation can be realized naturally in the gauge field theories as a sequence of seiberg dualities .",

    "there are many other possible periodic patterns in which we consider also simultaneous dualization of more than one gauge group factor .",
    "the examples of cascades dual to supergravity solutions present in literature have seiberg dualities occurring at constant intervals in @xmath139 , but the supergravity solution tells us only that the decreasing of the number of effective regular branes is linear in @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "this implies that in the most general cases there exist periodic flows with a constant interval in which the theory returns to itself without any permutation ( large step ) , while inside this step the seiberg dualities can be arbitrarily distributed in the energy ranges .",
    "we considered some of these general possibilities for a class of self - similar patterns in the specific case of @xmath138 , but we did nt succeed .",
    "in fact , even allowing dualizations of more than one gauge group simultaneously and varying the steps in energy of the dualities inside a long period we could not find any possible disposition of the initial values that realize a periodic flow of the coupling constants .",
    "the analysis is clearly not complete , but it seems that contrary to the known cases the @xmath17 of the theory does not follow the symmetries of the dimer .",
    "the possible solution to this problem may be related to the fact that until now we have considered only minimal toric phases of the theory , while in more general situations the cascade needs seiberg dualities between generic toric phases ( for example the cascade of the gauge theory dual to the complex cone over @xmath132 ) .",
    "a toric phase of a quiver gauge theory is a phase in which in the conformal regime all the gauge group factors are @xmath140 with the same rank .",

    "in fact in a generic point of the @xmath17 flow any factor of the gauge group has the form @xmath141 with @xmath142 an integer number .",
    "seiberg dualities inside the set of toric phases do not change the number @xmath15 of initial @xmath4-branes affecting only the term proportional to @xmath16 , while seiberg dualities that link toric phases with non - toric ones make the term proportional to @xmath15 increase .",
    "for this reason along the cascading @xmath17 flow we expect only toric phases , but in general also non - minimal ones .",
    "non - toric phases have more chiral fields than the minimal ones and in @xcite it is explained how to construct all the connected toric phases for the complete class of @xmath0 quiver gauge theories .",
    "it seems reasonable that to realize the @xmath17 flow dual to the supergravity solution for the entire class of @xmath0 manifolds we need to pass through non - minimal toric phases .",
    "this last point clearly needs more study .",
    "our next task is the study of the @xmath6 behaviour for the entire class of gauge theories dual to @xmath0 manifolds at the end of the cascade with @xmath143 .",
    "as explained in section [ generalypq ] the algebraic structure of these spaces suggests that the non - perturbative dynamics breaks supersymmetry .",
    "the point is that until now there are no tools in toric geometry or in dimer technology to understand if a stable non - supersymmetric vacuum exists ( @xmath29 ) or supersymmetry is in some sense restored at the infinity in the space of vevs of the fields ( runaway behavior ) .",
    "traditionally , one of the requirements for theories with @xmath29 is that they do not possess classically flat directions .",
    "this requirement was due to the observation that when classically flat directions are lifted by non - perturbative dynamics one usually finds a runaway behavior ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is because supersymmetry can be broken due to a variety of effects , but in general it is the consequence of the interplay between , on the one hand , a tree - level superpotential , which gives rise to a non - zero potential everywhere except at the origin in the space of fields , and , on the other hand , non - perturbative effects , which generate a potential that is non - zero at the origin also in presence of flat moduli ( see @xcite and references therein ) . ] . in @xcite",
    "it is proven that all the gauge theories dual to @xmath0 with @xmath143 have a gauge group factor with @xmath144 which hence generates an @xmath145 superpotential .",
    "this suggests that supersymmetry is broken . in the following",
    "we will give a complete classification of the pattern of the @xmath145 superpotentials , explaining that generically the number of gauge group factors that develop a non - perturbative @xmath145 superpotential is more than one .",
    "+ as an introduction to the problem we want to explain the general feeling about these theories . to understand the ir behavior we will consider the theories at the end of the cascades , where there are only fractional branes . at low energy",
    "the @xmath26 factors are massive and hence decoupled leaving only @xmath140 factors .",
    "in this situation we have two types of vevs : mesonic and baryonic .",
    "the former are given by the generators of the mesonic chiral ring and are in a one to one correspondence with the embedding coordinates of the singular algebraic intersection .",
    "actually there exists a precise map betweeen the set of generators of the dual lattice cone ( embedding coordinates ) and the generators of the mesonic chiral ring ( mesonic chiral primaries ) @xcite .",
    "this tells us that we will not have mesonic flat directions , because they are related to the coordinates of the cone and fractional branes must sit at its tip ( the origin of the embedding space ) imposing the vanishing of all the vevs of the mesonic chiral primaries . in this way we have at our disposal as runaway directions only the baryonic ones",
    "; indeed , we will see that it is always possible to construct a baryonic classically flat direction that is lifted to runaway by non - perturbative effects .",
    "this is what allows us to believe that the complete dynamics is runaway factors ( this corresponds in some sense to consider the correspondence in the string regime , before the low energy limit ) we can turn on @xmath146 terms for the @xmath26 . in the conformal regime",
    "their number is @xmath147 and they are related to the possible `` deformations '' of the supergravity solution on the geometry side and to non - baryonic operators on the field theory side @xcite . in this framework , runaway seems to be given by the fact that closed string fields at the singularity are dynamical and couple as @xmath146 terms in the gauge sector .",
    "these fields potentially stabilize the runaway lifting the classically flat directions thanks to @xmath25-terms conditions , but the complete dynamical process suggests us that at the end we have runaway .",
    "in fact the @xmath146 fields in string compactifications have no potential and the system relaxes pushing these fields to infinity restoring the runaway directions @xcite that in the low energy field theories language are baryonic directions",
    ". it would be interesting to understand if there is any relation between these @xmath146 terms and baryonic flat directions in general in the non - conformal regime . ] .",
    "clearly the complete dynamics of the theory is very complicated and it might happen that the khler potential stabilizes the otherwise runaway directions . + before starting our analysis of the @xmath0 family , we want to make some comments about the cases discussed in literature of quiver gauge theories that are dual to geometries that allow @xmath20 branes . in these situations",
    "an @xmath145 superpotential is generated that lifts the otherwise classical baryonic flat direction and gives a runaway behavior to the theory .",

    "it easy to write a gauge invariant operator with these two fields : @xmath153 this in fact parametrizes the runaway direction .",

    "we can have an effective superpotential of the form : @xmath161 where @xmath162 are other fields in the theory .",

    "as explained in the previous sections , most of the properties for the whole @xmath0 family can be easily read off the associated dimer graph . the reason why a general analysis can be carried out",
    "is related to the peculiarly simple properties of the tiling for this class of manifolds , allowing us to make general statements about the gauge structure at the end of the cascade and the way non - perturbative runaway terms may be generated in the low energy effective superpotential .      in section [ generalypq ]",
    "we outlined some important features of the dimer graph for the @xmath0 family .",
    "first and most important , we have @xmath163 periodicity in the transverse direction ; secondarily , as shown in @xcite , we are allowed to put all the @xmath45 divided hexagons consecutively . following @xcite , the general pattern for assigning @xmath164 or @xmath148 fields to vertical arrows is then the one of figure [ ypqfields ] .    , @xmath164 and @xmath13 fields inside the tiling for @xmath0 . ]    for all these reasons , and especially due to the @xmath163 periodicity , the number of colors for each factor group of the dual gauge theory is assigned in a very simple fashion following the recipe explained in section [ generalypq ] .",
    "let @xmath15 be the rank of the lowest - lying face of the whole tiling , which , by the above discussion , is the left half of a divided hexagon .",
    "then denote the quadrilaterals of the divided hexagons by an index @xmath165 starting from the bottom one , and label the regular ones as well with an another ascending index @xmath166 where @xmath167 corresponds to the face just above the tower of cut hexagons . according to table [ bcharges ] and making reference to figure [ ypqfields ]",
    ", it is easily seen that the number of colors are assigned as follows : @xmath168 m & \\quad \\hbox{$i$ even}\\\\ n +   [ ( i-1)q/2]m & \\quad \\hbox{$i$ odd } \\\\ \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] @xmath169 m   & \\quad \\hbox{$j$ even } \\\\",

    "our task in this section is to classify the gauge group factors that decouple in the @xmath6 ( @xmath171 ) and the ones that develop an @xmath145 superpotential ( @xmath172 ) . as a first step in our analysis we notice from ( [ eqdisacc1 ] ) and ( [ eqdisacc2 ] ) that the number of colors of the gauge group associated to the bottom - left half of the first cut hexagon is strictly smaller than @xmath173 and @xmath174 for all @xmath175 s and @xmath176 .",
    "thus we see that for this class of theories only the lowest gauge factor in the dimer graph decouples at the end of the cascade . + moreover , it is straightforward to figure out the conditions that ensure that one or more of the @xmath24 factors develop a non - perturbative superpotential of the affleck - dine - seiberg type",

    "first of all it is rapidly checked that the top - right half of the lowest hexagon , whose bottom - left half has undergone decoupling , does indeed generate an ads superpotential @xmath186 as far as the other cut hexagons are concerned , we only focus on quadrilaterals of even index @xmath72 since they are the only ones that have a chance to have @xmath144 : the odd ones have just two @xmath164 fields entering , which have baryonic charge equal to @xmath187 , and hence @xmath188 .. the distinction between `` bulk '' and `` boundary '' is now immaterial since in both cases we have , for the @xmath189 cut hexagon , an incoming @xmath60 field carrying a @xmath190 flavor index and a @xmath13 field with @xmath191 flavor symmetry . therefore ,",
    "for @xmath192 we have that @xmath193 @xmath194 so that the gauge factors which develop an ads - type superpotential are given by @xmath195 that is to say @xmath196 summing up , we are led to the following conclusions for the entire @xmath0 family with @xmath143 :    1 .   only one of the gauge factors , corresponding to the bottom - left half of the lowest - lying hexagon , decouples at the end of the cascade ; 2 .",
    "no uncut hexagon gives rise to ads - like terms in the quantum superpotential ; 3 .",

    "we are going to show that it is always possible to construct a gauge invariant classically flat baryonic direction which is turned to runaway by the @xmath145 non - perturbative contribution to the superpotential .",
    "we first make a distinction among the models under scrutiny according to whether the top divided hexagon generates an ads superpotential or not .",
    "we then focus first our attention to the case in which the top - right half of the last cut hexagon is such that @xmath199 . by equation ( [ eqads ] )",

    "we suggest that in both cases a classically flat direction described by a baryonic gauge invariant field is pushed to infinity in the quantum theory because of the appearance of the above mentioned affleck - dine - seiberg terms .",
    "+ the @xmath28 case is most easily worked out : let us build the matrix @xmath149 of the meson fields for the top hexagon according to the following definitions ( see figure [ yp1-bfig ] ) , in which for the sake of notational clarity we put the number of fractional branes @xmath177 : m_p , p-1 & & y_p,2p-1u^(2)_2p-1,p-1 + n_p , p-1 & & y_p,2p-1u^(1)_2p-1,p-1 + l_p-2,p-1 & & z_p-2,2p-1u^(2)_2p-1,p-1 + o_p-2,p-1 & & z_p-2,2p-1 u^(1)_2p-1,p-1 each @xmath203 field , carrying gauge indices @xmath12 and @xmath204 in the fundamental of @xmath205 and in the antifundamental of @xmath206 respectively is actually a @xmath207 rectangular matrix @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 .",

    "the @xmath30-term equation for the field @xmath214 ( see figure [ yp1-bfig ] ) reads @xmath215 as a matrix equation , i.e. the upper - left block in @xmath149 is identically zero due to the fact that , after decoupling of the first bottom - left quadrilateral , the @xmath214 field appears only once inside a term of the form @xmath216 in the superpotential . consequently 2p-3 which forces = 0 this in turn implies that [ runawayyp1-a ] = 0 & & v^(2)_p-1,p= ^4p-1 + = 0 & & v^(1)_p-1,p= -^4p-1 [ runawayyp1-b ] now we observe that we can build the following field from the @xmath217-fold antisymmetrized product of @xmath218 fields , with @xmath219 an @xmath52 replica index and @xmath72 , @xmath220 running on the fundamental of @xmath221 and the antifundamental of @xmath222 respectively , b^_|j _",

    "we can form a baryon simply taking the threefold antisymmetric product of @xmath332 _ 1 = _ ijklmnp_ijp_klp_mn as far as the runaway direction induced by the behavior of @xmath328 is concerned , it can be parameterized by a gauge - invariant baryonic composite field in the following fashion .",
    "define    ccll q^1_ik & & ( x_54)_ik & i=1  4 , k=1  6 + q^2_ik & & ( y_14)_il(y_51)_lk & i=1  4 , l=1  5 , k=1  6 +    notice that , for generic values @xmath330 and @xmath331 , which are @xmath333 and @xmath334 matrices respectively , @xmath335 is a generic @xmath336 matrix and in particular it may have maximal rank , as opposed to the previously examined case of the product matrix @xmath337 for @xmath298",
    ". we may thus write _ 2 & = & _ i_1  i_6 _ j_1  j_6 q^1_i_1 j_1 ",
    "q^1_i_4 j_4 q^1_i_5 b_1 q^1_i_6 b_2 q^2_j_1 b_3q^2_j_2 b_4q^2_j_3 c_1",
    " q^2_j_6 c_4 + & & _ a_1  a_4 _ b_1  b_4 _ c_1  c_4 again , we are led to the conclusion that the runaway behavior of @xmath328 and @xmath326 turns baryonic classically flat directions into runaway .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the infrared behavior for a wide class of quiver gauge theories with known gravity duals .",
    "these include the whole @xmath0 family and a subclass of @xmath1 singularities .",
    "we have provided arguments that the general scenario is such that a baryonic classically flat direction is lifted to infinity due to non - perturbative effects , which suggests that the complete dynamics does not allow a non - supersymmetric stable vacuum for finite values of the moduli .",
    "this is clearly a point which deserves further investigation : in particular , it would be interesting ( though very difficult ) to consider how the khler dynamics may affect this picture . moreover , even if we have arguments that tend to exclude the presence of a stable non - supersymmetric vacuum for this class of theories , the question about the existence of metastable vacua is completely left open @xcite .",
    "+ the runaway behavior on the gauge theory side rises many interesting questions about what happens to the supergravity solution at the end of the throat .",
    "everything seems to suggest some kind of instability in the full solution , but the gravity dual of a runaway behavior is not yet well understood . + now that we have a definite map between toric singular calabi - yau cone and dual quiver gauge field theories it would be interesting to study the subject of dynamical supersymmetry breaking gauge theories with a gravity dual in the generic toric case .",
    "a particularly exciting point would be to understand if it is possible to realize , in the context of the theories allowing a dimer representation , dynamically supersymmetry breaking without runaway ; this would be a remarkable achievement in the study of the gauge / gravity correspondence since it would lead , in line of principle , to the possibility to construct a string solution with a stable non - supersymmetric vacuum .",
