    "the study of the @xmath0 mesons in p+p , d+au and au+au collisions is a tool to address issue of the intermediate and high @xmath5 particle production induced by the cold and hot nuclear medium .",
    "the recent data from rhic showed an enhancement of protons ( baryon ) compared to the pions ( meson ) in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "this enhancement is substantially pronounced compared to p+p collisions .",
    "there are puzzles connected with the origin of this observation : is it a mass effect or the baryon - meson effect .",
    "the former is predicted by the hydrodynamics while the latter is proposed by the recombination models @xcite .",
    "the nuclear modification factors , @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the elliptic flow , @xmath6 , of the @xmath0 mesons are important observables to address the baryon - meson puzzle at rhic . the former measures directly the magnitude of a suppression or enhancement while the latter represents the final state interaction measured by the quark - number scaling @xcite .",
    "the phenix experiment at rhic has measured the @xmath0 mesons in the recent high luminosity au+au collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev .",
    "the data from 2002 - 2003 d+au @xcite and p+p collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev have also been analyzed for the @xmath0 .",
    "we report the nuclear modification measurements in au+au and d+au collisions and the first results on @xmath7 analysis of the @xmath0 mesons in @xmath8 decay channel .",
    "the phenix central arm spectrometer @xcite consists of east and west arms where the produced particles are being tracked by the drift chamber and pad chambers .",
    "the kaons are identified by the lead scintillator ( pbsc ) and time of flight ( tof ) subsystems located at the central arm spectrometers within @xmath10 0.35 . while the tof wall covers only a small fraction of the east arm",
    "( @xmath11 45@xmath12 ) , the pbsc arrays cover the other half of the east ( @xmath11 45@xmath12 ) and all of the west ( @xmath11 90@xmath12 ) arm .",
    "the better timing resolution with tof compared to pbsc enables us to identify the kaons within @xmath13 and @xmath14 with tof and pbsc respectively within 2@xmath15 @xmath16/k separation bands in mass - squared distribution .",
    "the results presented here are based on minimum bias and centrality selected datasets within a collision vertex of @xmath17 30 cm .",
    "the nuclear modification results discussed here are based on 170 @xmath18 10@xmath19 and 409 @xmath18 10@xmath19 au+au minimum bias events for pbsc and tof analyses respectively along with 43 @xmath18 10@xmath19 p+p minimum bias events .",
    "@xmath3 measurements in d+au collisions were performed with 54 @xmath18 10@xmath19 minimum bias events .",
    "the elliptic flow analysis , however , used about 800 @xmath18 10@xmath19 minimum bias au+au events .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath0 mesons takes place in two steps .",
    "first , we combine oppositely charged kaons to form unlike sign invariant mass spectrum which has combinatorial background . in the second step , we estimate the combinatorial background by event mixing technique where we combine all @xmath20 s from one event with all @xmath21 s from the ten other events of the same centrality and vertex class .",
    "the validity of this event mixing technique is confirmed with like sign distributions .",
    "the unlike sign mixed event mass distribution is then normalized to the measured 2@xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the measured integrals of like sign yields .",
    "finally , the @xmath0 meson invariant mass spectrum is reconstructed by subtracting the combinatorial background from the same event @xmath8 spectrum .",
    "we counted the @xmath0 mesons within a mass window of @xmath25 5 mev/@xmath26 about the measured centroid .",
    "[ phi ] shows the minimum bias @xmath9 invariant mass spectrum in au+au collisions ( left ) and @xmath27 spectra of the @xmath0 in centrality selected au+au and p+p collisions .",
    "the nuclear modification factors , @xmath3 and @xmath2 are defined as :    @xmath28    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the number of binary collisions .",
    "the nuclear modification factor , @xmath2 is plotted as a function of @xmath31 in fig .  [ rcpraa ] ( a - b ) where we show that the ratio of the @xmath0 meson yields in ( a ) central ( 0 - 10% ) and ( b ) peripheral ( 60 - 90% ) au + au to p+p collisions .",
    "the proton and @xmath4 data points are also shown for comparison .",
    "the figures show that the @xmath0 mesons are strongly suppressed and their suppression factor is consistent with the @xmath4 s .    for au + au collisions",
    ", we calculated @xmath3 as a ratio of @xmath30 scaled @xmath0 yields in 0 - 10% and 60 - 90% centralities ( fig .",
    "[ rcpraa](c ) ) whereas for d+au collisions we took 0 - 20% as the most central and 60 - 88% as the most peripheral bins ( fig .",
    "[ rcpraa](d ) ) . in both au+au and d+au cases , we plotted the results of protons and @xmath4 s for comparison . in au+au collision",
    ", we also included the @xmath3 of @xmath32 particles .",
    "the figure shows the suppression of the @xmath0 mesons that is consistent with @xmath4 s while there is non - suppression ( or enhancement ) of ( anti)protons and @xmath32 s in au+au collisions . in the cold nuclear matter produced by d+au collisions",
    ", however , we do not observe any suppression of the @xmath0 mesons .      the elliptic flow ( @xmath7 ) is studied by investigating the azimuthal asymmetry of the @xmath0 meson emission with respect to the event reaction plane as :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the azimuthal angle of the @xmath0 mesons with respect to the reaction plane angle of the event . fig .",
    "[ v2 ] shows ( a ) @xmath6 of the @xmath0 mesons in minimum bias au + au collisions as a function of @xmath5 and ( b ) quark - number ( n ) scaled @xmath6 , @xmath35 as a function of @xmath31/n .",
    "the elliptic flow parameter for the identified particles are also shown on the plots for comparison . within the present size of the statistical error at different @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath6/n of the @xmath0",
    "are consistent with other hadrons .",
    "the phenix experiment at rhic has measured the nuclear modification factors , @xmath3 and @xmath2 of the @xmath0 mesons . in au + au collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev",
    ", the @xmath0 meson shows similar suppression as the @xmath4 s and therefore follows a completely different trend than the ( anti)protons and @xmath32 s .",
    "this indicates the presence of a strong constituent quark number effect ( baryon / meson effect ) compared to the mass effect in particle production at intermediate @xmath31 at rhic .",
    "the d+au control experiment does not show any suppression effect in @xmath3 of the @xmath0 , similar to the case for other hadrons .",
    "the elliptic flow of the @xmath0 mesons has been measured for the minimum bias data sample . within the present statistical errors the @xmath6 of the @xmath0 meson exhibits a non - zero elliptic flow magnitude as scaled by the quark number which is consistent with",
    "the quark number scaled @xmath6 magnitude of the other hadrons .",
