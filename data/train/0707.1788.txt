    "at high energy densities ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) a phase transition from a hadron gas to a quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) is expected to occur .",
    "there are indications that at rhic and top sps energies a quark - gluon - plasma is created in the early stages of heavy ion collisions  @xcite . and indeed",
    ", the energy dependence of various observables show anomalies at low sps energies which might be related to the onset of deconfinement  .",
    "while several observables @xcite have been proposed throughout the last decades to study the characteristics of the highly excited matter created in heavy ions collisions the ones related to fluctuations and correlations seem to be the most prospective .",
    "fluctuation probes might be more adequate for the exploration of heavy ion reactions , because the distributions of energy density or initial temperature , isospin and particle density have strong fluctuations from event to event @xcite .",
    "on the theoretical side event - by - event fluctuations were suggested to study    * kinetic and chemical equilibration in nuclear collisions @xcite , * the onset of the deconfinement phase @xcite * the location of the tri - critical end - point of the qcd phase transition @xcite or * the formation of exotic states , like dccs @xcite .    on the experimental side ,",
    "progress has been made by many experiments to extract momentum and particle number ratio fluctuations from heavy ion reaction : currently , event - by - event fluctuations are actively studied in the sps energy regime ( starting from 20a  gev on ) by the na49 group @xcite , the ceres @xcite and the wa98 collaboration @xcite . at rhic energies the phenix @xcite and star @xcite experiments are addressing the field of single event physics .    in @xcite",
    "it was predicted that the onset of deconfinement should lead to a non - monotonous behaviour in multiplicity fluctuations ( `` shark fin '' ) .",
    "also droplet formation during the phase transition is expected to produce non - statistical fluctuations 10 - 100 times the poisson expectation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , lattice qcd calculations suggest the existence of a critical point in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter which separates the first order phase transition from a crossover . thus , if the system passes the vicinity of the critical region during its evolution and remains there for long enough time one expects an increase of multiplicity fluctuations @xcite .    the na49 collaboration is currently searching for such anomalies in the energy dependence of multiplicity fluctuations in pb+pb  collisions .",
    "a similar program to search for the critical point and signals for the onset of deconfinement will be undertaken by the rhic experiments ( the planned critrhic program ) with a lowering of the rhic s beam energy towards the sps energy regime and the na61 ( shine ) experiment  @xcite with the focus on light ion collisions .",
    "for the present investigation however , we will focus on the soon available data from the na49 experiment on multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "unfortunately both the geometrical acceptance of the detector and the centrality selection in the na49 experiment is not trivial and have an influence on the multiplicity fluctuations . in order to observe an increase of fluctuations caused by one of the effects mentioned above ,",
    "a systematic theoretical investigation within a transport approach is needed . only with this baseline for the expected multiplicity fluctuations within the experimental acceptance a possible excess of fluctuations in data",
    "could be unambiguously interpreted as a signal for the critical point or the onset of deconfinement .",
    "the model predictions presented in this paper are obtained using urqmd 1.3 @xcite . for a complementary transport theoretical study of multiplicity fluctuations ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the probability to have in an event a given number of particles @xmath2 in the acceptance is denoted as @xmath3 , with the normalisation @xmath4 .",
    "the measure of multiplicity fluctuations used in this paper is the scaled variance @xmath5 defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the variance and the mean of the multiplicity distributions , respectively .",
    "this measure is used because of its two properties .",
    "firstly in a grand - canonical statistical model neglecting quantum effects the multiplicity is a poisson distribution : @xmath9 the variance of a poisson distribution is equal to its mean , the scaled variance is therefore @xmath10 , independent of mean multiplicity .",
    "secondly in a wounded nucleon model  @xcite , the scaled variance in @xmath11 collisions is the same as in proton - proton collisions provided the number of wounded nucleons is fixed .",
    "if the particles are produced independently in momentum space , the scaled variance in a limited acceptance is related to the scaled variance in full phase space ( @xmath12 ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fraction of tracks which are in the corresponding acceptance . for a small acceptance @xmath14 the scaled variance approaches 1 .",
    "note that effects like resonance decays , quantum statistics and energy - momentum conservation introduce correlations in momentum space and therefore a scaling according to equation [ wscale ] is generally not valid .    in the following the scaled variance of positively ,",
    "negatively and all charged hadrons are denoted as @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "for our investigation , we apply the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model ( urqmd v1.3 )  @xcite to heavy ion reactions from @xmath18  gev to @xmath19  gev .",
    "this microscopic transport approach is based on the covariant propagation of constituent quarks and di - quarks accompanied by mesonic and baryonic degrees of freedom .",
    "it simulates multiple interactions of in - going and newly produced particles , the excitation and fragmentation of colour strings and the formation and decay of hadronic resonances . towards higher energies ,",
    "the treatment of sub - hadronic degrees of freedom is of major importance . in the present model ,",
    "these degrees of freedom enter via the introduction of a formation time for hadrons produced in the fragmentation of strings @xcite . a phase transition to a quark - gluon state",
    "is not incorporated explicitly into the model dynamics . however , a detailed analysis of the model in equilibrium , yields an effective equation of state of hagedorn type @xcite .",
    "this model has been used before to study event - by - event fluctuations rather successfully @xcite and yields a reasonable description of inclusive particle distributions . for a complete review of the model ,",

    "the scaled variance is smaller than one and the multiplicity distributions are narrower than the corresponding poisson distributions . for higher energies the scaled variance is larger than one .",
    "a similar behaviour of p+p and p+n collisions is observed , the small difference is probably caused by the additional proton in p+p collisions , which does not fluctuate .",
    "therefore the scaled variance for positively and all charged particles is a bit lower in p+p than in p+n collisions .",
    "the scaled variance in pb+pb  collisions behaves similar as in p+p interactions .",
    "the hsd model yields similar results  @xcite .    for positively and negatively charged hadrons",
    "the scaled variance is similar , where the values are about twice as high for all charged hadrons .",
    "this is partly due to resonances decaying into two oppositely charged particles .",
    "such a resonance is detected as two charged particles , therefore the fluctuations are increased .",
    "the experimental data on the energy dependence of scaled variance of all charged hadrons in p+p interactions is parametrised in @xcite as @xmath32 the urqmd results are in agreement with the data at ags and sps energies , but the fluctuations are slightly overpredicted at rhic energies .",
    "figure  [ ed_w ] shows that the energy dependence of scaled variance predicted by the urqmd model is totally different to the predictions of a hadron gas model @xcite ( for further details the reader is referred also to @xcite ) . in the grand - canonical ( gce ) , canonical ( ce ) and micro - canonical ( mce ) ensemble the scaled variance stays constant for high energies , where in the urqmd model it strongly increases with energy .",
    "therefore experimental data on multiplicity fluctuations , preferably at high ( rhic , lhc ) energies , should be able to distinguish between hadron gas and string - hadronic models  @xcite .    for a more differential study of fluctuations and for a better comparison to experimental results , three different rapidity intervals , one at midrapidity @xmath33 , one at forward rapidity @xmath34 and a combination of both @xmath35 , covering most of the forward hemisphere , were taken . for @xmath36 collisions the forward hemisphere includes the rapidity of the projectile neutron . the scaled variance for these intervals for positively , negatively and all charged particles",
