    "the theory of brownian motion was described and formulated in its most elegant way by albert einstein in 1905 @xcite .",
    "he derived a relationship between the diffusion coefficient of the particle and the viscosity of the fluid in which the particle is suspended .",
    "the general form of this relationship is known as the so - called fluctuation - dissipation theorem which is one of the building blocks of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "not so long after the promising work of einstein , others developed the classical theory of brownian motion @xcite .",
    "some authors analyzed brownian motion from the purely mathematical point of view @xcite .",
    "the concept of brownian motion is not limited to the erratic motion of a particle in a fluid , it can be generalized to the fluctuating behavior of a system of interest interacting with its surroundings for instance molecular motion @xcite , a charged particle in an electromagnetic field @xcite , biological membranes @xcite , motion in a spin bath @xcite , polar molecules in external fields @xcite and even modelling for stock market @xcite and so on .",
    "there exists a variety of alternative but equivalent approaches to investigate brownian motion .",
    "the most celebrated ones include probability distribution functions @xcite and langevin method @xcite for classical brownian motion , and feynman path integral @xcite , mainly concerned with deriving the master equation for both linear and non - linear couplings to the environment and white and colored noise and finally , operator langevin equation @xcite and stochastic methods @xcite for quantum brownian motion . in the vast majority of the works mentioned above",
    ", the authors took advantage of system plus reservoir method of treating open systems .    in the present paper",
    "we describe the quantum brownian motion of a rod - like particle which is interacting with a quantum reservoir and undergoes both translational and rotational motions .",
    "this kind of dynamics appears for example in the appealing subject of nano rod crystals and rigid rod - like macromolecules that have attracted remarkable attention especially in biological systems @xcite . in particular , rotational brownian motion",
    "is involved in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) interpretation of many physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "however we follow the system plus reservoir approach to tackle the problem .",
    "there are two commonly used models for modeling a quantum reservoir or heat bath based on the properties of the reservoir .",
    "one can choose a reservoir consisting of non - interacting quantum oscillators @xcite if memory or non - ohmic properties of the system are important or model the heat bath using appropriate scalar or vector fields @xcite if ohmic properties are considered .",
    "here we follow the latter choice and couple the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the particle with two independent vector fields .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the model is introduced and a total lagrangian for the system and reservoir is given . in sec .",
    "iii the equations of motion are derived , with two sub sections a and b devoted to translational and rotational motions respectively . in sec .",
    "iv , the correlation functions and mean values of linear and angular momentum are deduced .",
    "the mean square displacement and orientation in the brownian time scales are calculated . finally , we conclude in sec . v.",
    "the motion of a rigid body is described in terms of the translational motion of its center of mass and the rotational motion of its orientation .",
    "one needs to have a convenient frame of reference to describe the motion , body - fixed frame or laboratory - fixed frame .",
    "we work in the laboratory - fixed frame .",
    "consider the special case of a long and thin rod ( large aspect ratio ) for which the rotational motion around the cylinder axis of symmetry is disregarded .",
    "this thin rod can be thought of as a prolate top since the inverse of its inertial momentum around its axis is much larger than the perpendicular components .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath0 is thought of as being perpendicular to the cylinder axis of symmetry .",
    "the surrounding medium exerts a fluctuating force as well as a fluctuating torque on the rod . for ohmic damping the medium",
    "can be modeled by two independent vector fields , coupled to translational and orientational degrees of freedom of the rod .",
    "the lagrangian of the total system , rod plus medium reads @xmath1\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}dx\\,\\left[(c^{-1}\\partial_{t}\\boldsymbol\\psi(x , t))^{2}-(\\partial_{x}\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol\\psi}(x , t))^{2}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\alpha\\,\\mathbf{\\omega}\\cdot\\boldsymbol\\varphi(0,t)-\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\gamma}'_{f}\\cdot\\boldsymbol\\psi(x , t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equations @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the vector fields describing the medium , @xmath4 is the coupling constant between @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "the friction tensor @xmath5 couples @xmath3 with the translational velocity .",
    "it is most convenient to decompose the fields in body frame where parallel and perpendicular means parallel to the symmetry axis of the rod and perpendicular to this axis , see fig .",
    "so we can write @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the dyadic tensor in the direction of the rod . now",
    "if we rewrite the lagrangian in terms of these generalized variables we get @xmath8 the generalized momenta are defined by @xmath9 the corresponding hamiltonian has the following minimal coupling structure @xmath10 ^ 2}{2m}+    \\frac{[\\mathbf{p}_{\\perp}+\\gamma'_{\\perp}\\,\\boldsymbol\\psi_{\\perp}(0,t)]^2}{2m}+\\frac{[\\mathbf{p}_{\\omega}+\\alpha\\,\\boldsymbol\\varphi ( 0,t)]^2}{2i } \\\\     & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\int dx\\,\\{c^2 \\boldsymbol\\pi_\\varphi^2 + ( \\partial_x \\boldsymbol\\varphi)^2\\}+      \\frac{1}{2}\\int dx\\,\\{c^2 \\boldsymbol\\pi_{\\varphi_\\parallel}^2 + ( \\partial_x \\boldsymbol\\psi_{\\parallel})^2\\ } \\\\     & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\int dx\\,\\{c^2 \\boldsymbol\\pi_{\\varphi_\\perp}^2 + ( \\partial_x \\boldsymbol\\psi_{\\perp})^2\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to quantize the system we impose the following equal - time commutation relations @xmath11 = i\\hbar\\,\\delta ( x - x')\\mathbb{i } \\\\    & & [ \\boldsymbol\\psi_{\\perp } ( x , t ) , \\boldsymbol\\pi_{\\perp } ( x',t ) ] = i\\hbar\\,\\delta ( x - x')\\mathbb{i } \\\\    & & [ \\boldsymbol\\psi_{\\parallel } ( x , t ) , \\boldsymbol\\pi_{\\parallel } ( x',t ) ] = i\\hbar\\,\\delta(x - x')\\mathbb{i } \\\\    & & [ \\mathbf{r}_{\\parallel},\\mathbf{p}_{\\parallel } ] = i\\hbar\\mathbb{i } \\\\    & & [ \\mathbf{r}_{\\perp},\\mathbf{p}_{\\perp } ] = i\\hbar\\mathbb{i } \\\\    & & [ \\mathbf{\\omega},\\mathbf{p}_{\\omega } ] = i\\hbar\\mathbb{i},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the unit matrix .",
    "from hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and heisenberg equations for the translational momentum we find @xmath13 the same equations for the vector fields @xmath14 yield @xmath15 with the solution @xmath16 the field @xmath17 is the solution to the homogenous equation that can be expressed in terms of creation and annihilation operators as @xmath18 the operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 satisfy the bosonic commutation relations @xmath21=\\delta(k - k'),\\qquad [ \\hat{b}_{\\perp}(k,\\lambda),\\hat{b}^{\\dag}_{\\perp}(k',\\lambda')]=\\delta_{\\lambda\\lambda'}\\delta(k - k').\\ ] ] with all other commutators being zero .",
    "the transverse polarization unit vectors satisfy @xmath22 , and with @xmath23 make an orthogonal frame . now that the explicit form of the field is known",
    ", the translational velocity can be fully determined @xmath24 this is the well - known langevin equation in which @xmath25 and @xmath26 are defined as @xmath27\\cdot\\dot{\\boldsymbol\\psi}_{h}(0,t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the noise field is a linear expression in creation and annihilation operators its expectation value is zero as expected .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) can be integrated to give the translational momentum . for this purpose note",
    "that the friction tensor @xmath26 has the property @xmath28 using this property the green function @xmath29 takes the form @xmath30 leading to the following equations for the transverse and parallel components of the momentum of the rod @xmath31 where @xmath32      the angular velocity of the rod is perpendicular to the rod orientation . using the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) , the equation of motion for the angular velocity yields @xmath33 also for the vector field @xmath34 we have @xmath35 following the lines of the previous section @xmath36 where @xmath37.\\ ] ] the langevin equation for the angular velocity is @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating eq .",
    "( [ m11 ] ) results in the angular velocity @xmath41 the explicit form of the angular velocity in the long time limit can be obtained in terms of the creation and annihilation operators as @xmath42,\\ ] ] likewise , the angular momentum @xmath43 can be written as @xmath44.\\ ] ]",
    "due to the linearity of the coupling between the system and the reservoir the noise force and torque obey gaussian statistics .",
    "however their auto correlation functions play a significant role in determining how the environment affects the system .",
    "the parallel and perpendicular components of the fluctuating force and the torque were obtained as @xmath45 regarding the commutation properties of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , for the correlation between @xmath48 and @xmath49 we find @xmath50 the symmetric correlations for each component is @xmath51 where @xmath52 . in high - temperature regime ( classical limit )",
    "the above equations turn into @xmath53 and we recover the fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "the terms @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the parallel and perpendicular fluctuation strengths respectively .",
    "it is seen that the perpendicular fluctuating strength is twice its parallel counter part .    using the expression given for the torque ,",
    "the correlation at different times is obtained as @xmath56 and in the classical limit we find @xmath57 so the rotational fluctuating strength is @xmath58 .",
    "now that the force and torque correlations are known one can go further and calculate the correlations between the desired variables , i.e translational and angular velocity . due to the fact that the long time behaviour of these variables are of interest",
    ", the terms having the decaying exponential prefactor do not contribute in correlations , after performing the required manipulations it is found that @xmath59 and @xmath60 one can use the obtained mean values for the parallel and perpendicular momenta and the angular velocity to calculate the mean energy of the system @xmath61 substituting the obtained values in ( [ ener ] ) , the total energy of the system reads @xmath62 which equals the classical energy of a molecule with five degrees of freedom .",
    "however for quantum mechanical case , due to the divergence of the integrals of the type @xmath63 the energy of the system is divergent as has been stated in the literature @xcite about the unphysical results of ohmic approximation in quantum mechanics .",
    "usually one can be less strict about these divergencies and circumvent the problem by introducing a cut - off frequency in the upper limit of the integral .      in the brownian time scale for which the momentum of the brownian particle relaxes due to the friction with its environment , inertial forces can be neglected",
    "so the fore @xmath64 can be omitted from the following equation of motion @xcite @xmath65 hence one can write @xmath66 according to the properties of the friction tensor @xmath26 we have @xmath67 therefore , @xmath68.\\ ] ] the mean square displacement , i.e @xmath69 is found as @xmath70 which is consistent with the known results for einstein translational diffusion coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72      the orientation of the rod is a unit vector which is stationary in the body frame but in the laboratory frame it changes with time according to the following relation @xmath73 in order to find @xmath74 in the lab frame , we make use of the euler parametrization which is associated with three successive rotations through the angles @xmath75 and @xmath76 . the rotation matrix is given by @xmath77 the angles @xmath78 are functions of time .",
    "now if we denote the unit vectors in the body frame by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we can assume that @xmath80 is @xmath81 in the lab frame showing the orientation of the rod .",
    "the unit vectors in the lab frame are the conventional @xmath82 using the rotation matrix @xmath83 the relation between the two frames is obtained @xmath84 therefore , @xmath85 in the previous sections the angular velocity in the body frame was obtained as @xmath86 \\equiv\\mathbf{\\omega}_{1}(t)\\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_{1}+\\mathbf{\\omega}_{2}(t)\\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_{2},\\ ] ] which in the lab frame is @xmath87\\mathbf{\\hat{i } } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left[(\\mathbf{\\omega}_{2}\\cos\\alpha-\\mathbf{\\omega}_{1}\\sin\\alpha(t))\\cos\\gamma-   ( \\mathbf{\\omega}_{1}\\cos\\alpha+\\mathbf{\\omega}_{2}\\sin\\alpha)\\cos\\beta\\sin\\gamma\\right]\\mathbf{\\hat{j } } \\nonumber\\\\ & - & ( \\mathbf{\\omega}_{1}\\cos\\alpha+\\mathbf{\\omega}_{2})\\sin\\beta\\mathbf{\\hat{k}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for notational convenience explicit time dependence of parameters has been ignored .",
    "now recall the langevin equation for @xmath88 @xmath89 as it was justified before ( for mean square displacement ) in the brownian time scale one can neglect the time derivative of angular momentum so that the angular velocity can be written as @xmath90 the time derivative of the unit vector @xmath81 takes the following form @xmath91 introducing an antisymmetric matrix @xmath92 equation ( [ udot ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath93 the matrix @xmath94 can be decomposed in the bases @xmath95 these matrices are linearly independent and they satisfy the commutation relation @xmath96=\\varepsilon_{ijk}\\mathbf{l}_{k}$ ] in which @xmath97 is the levi - civita symbol . from iteration method , one finds the solution to ( [ udotf ] ) as @xmath98 in order to find the mean square rotational displacement one has to calculate @xmath99,\\ ] ] where the mean velocity is @xmath100 in @xmath101 bases the matrix @xmath94 can be written as @xmath102 using the wick s theorem one can find the @xmath103-pint correlation functions easily . in high temperature regime ( classical limit ) the @xmath104 functions are delta - correlated at different times .",
    "applying this property and also the identity @xmath105 one finds @xmath106 now from wick s theorem and ( [ ff],[umean ] ) we find @xmath107 where @xmath108 therefore , @xmath109.\\ ] ]",
    "by modeling the environment by two independent vector fields the quantum brownian motion of a rod - like particle was investigated in the frame work of canonical quantization .",
    "the quantum mechanical and classical limits for both translational and rotational motions were obtained .",
