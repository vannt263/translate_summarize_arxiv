    "the break is at @xmath50 , between the f105w and f140w bands : @xmath51@xmath52@xmath53    and for @xmath13 , the break is between the f125w and f160w bands : @xmath54    we require that a candidate must not be detected above @xmath40 in a summed image blueward of the selection bands defined above . for objects at @xmath55 ,",
    "this requires a non - detection in a summed image of the f606w and f435w bands , while for candidates at @xmath56 this requires a non - detection in the stacked optical detection image .",
    "in addition to the color selection criteria described above , we also exclude candidates lying within one arcsecond of the detector edges , in order to mitigate potentially spurious photometry . we also exclude candidates lying near stellar diffraction spikes , which are difficult to remove because hff wfc3/ir exposures were obtained at the same position angle .",
    "finally , we also identify and remove candidates with a color decrement of f160w - irac @xmath57 , as they are most likely extremely red objects at lower redshift ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "our photometry is measured within an isophotal aperture , but aperture - corrected to a total flux using the @xmath59 difference in the f160w band . in a few cases where source blending is significant ,",
    "we visually inspect the images and choose an aperture that is larger than the source s full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) , but not so large as to be affected by nearby sources , and use the corresponding aperture magnitude in place of @xmath60 .",
    "we also verify that our aperture colors ( and therefore our list of high - redshift candidates ) are not affected by image artifacts if we use the publicly released mosaics based on the _ mosaicdrizzle _ pipeline @xcite .",
    "the irac images of our candidates suffer from crowding due to the instrument s large point spread function ( psf , fwhm @xmath61 ) , such that simple aperture photometry might result in inaccurate fluxes due to contamination from nearby sources . to address this issue",
    ", we use a deblending technique whereby contaminating neighbors are subtracted using galfit @xcite by performing a fit to the objects of interest and all their close neighbors simultaneously in a @xmath62 fitting window around the source of interest @xcite .",
    "the irac psf is determined from the same image by stacking 10 bright , isolated point sources .",
    "positions and radial profiles of neighboring sources in this region are derived from the higher resolution  f160w - band mosaic , while the initial input magnitudes are obtained by running sextractor on the irac images . during the fitting process",
    ", all input parameters are allowed to vary , except for the positions of the objects of interest .",
    "this process is similar to that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "four of our candidates are so heavily blended by nearby bright sources with complex radial profiles that galfit fails to satisfactorily deblend them .",
    "this yields a total of 16 sources for which photometry or upper limits from galfit are possible ( see table  [ tbl - irac ] ) .",
    "we carry out extensive tests to check the reliability of our irac photometry for each source .",
    "first , we place a simulated point source of magnitude 25 near the candidate and run galfit with different fitting windows and background levels until the expected magnitude of each simulated source is recovered ( with a magnitude difference @xmath63  mag compared to the input value , consistent with the photometric errors ) .",
    "we then proceed to fit the flux of each candidate , using the fitting window and background level on the image that recovered the brightness of the simulated source .",
    "we repeat these tests at three different positions for the simulated source to verify our measurement of the source magnitude . to account for the uncertainties in estimating the background , we choose the average magnitude of three measurements as the source magnitude , which are reported in table  [ tbl - irac ] .    in figures  [ fig - z9]-[fig - z7 ] we show cutout images of all the candidates .    [ fig - z8 ]",
    "as part of the hff initiative , seven independently derived gravitational lensing models of the abell  2744 field were developed and publicly released through the mast archive . for our analysis we adopt the zitrin `` nfw '' model as our fiducial lensing model , and utilize the other six models to help quantify the systematic uncertainties in our magnification estimates .",
    "the zitrin `` nfw '' model assumes a pseudo - isothermal elliptical mass distribution for each cluster galaxy , scaled by the galaxy luminosity , and an elliptical nfw @xcite halo for the dark matter . in the case of ,",
    "two such elliptical nfw halos are used , centered on the two central , brightest cluster galaxies to represent the global dark - matter component .",
    "these are combined with the galaxies component to generate , via a long monte - carlo - markov - chain minimization , the best - fitting model for the total projected mass ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .    to estimate the systematic uncertainty in the magnification of each of our high - redshift candidates , we exclude the highest and lowest magnification factors and then calculate the difference in the second - highest and second - lowest magnifications from the different models .",
    "this procedure is designed to mitigate potential extremes in the model predictions , and better reflect the true systematic uncertainties .",
    "the magnification factors listed in tables  [ tbl - z9]-[tbl - z7 ] are the best - fit values at the tabulated redshift based on the zitrin `` nfw '' model , while the uncertainties are the quadrature sum of the systematic and statistical uncertainties . figure  [ fig - fov ] shows the composite color image of the abell  2744 field , overlaid with the critical curves and identification numbers for all our candidates .",
    "we calculate photometric redshifts using the bayesian photometric redshift code bpz ( bayesian photometric redshifts ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , adopting the same template library used by the clash collaboration @xcite .",
    "the template set consists of five elliptical galaxy templates , two spiral galaxy templates , and four starburst galaxy templates with moderately strong emission lines .",
    "the templates were originally based on the pgase stellar population synthesis models @xcite , but have been recalibrated using spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies with deep , multiband photometry from the fireworks survey @xcite .",
    "we assume ignorant ( _ i.e. _ , flat ) priors on both galaxy type and redshift in the range @xmath64 .",
    "using bpz , we identify 24 candidates that satisfy our color selection criteria ( see  [ sec : selection ] ) and whose photometric redshifts place them at @xmath65 . in tables",
    "[ tbl - z9]-[tbl - z7 ] we list the coordinates , photometric redshifts , _ hst _ photometry , and magnifications of these 27 candidates .    in order to infer the physical properties of our high - redshift candidates ( see  [ sec : properties ] ) , and as an additional check on the bpz - based photometric redshifts , we use the bayesian spectral energy distribution ( sed ) modeling code isedfit @xcite . using a monte carlo technique ,",
    "we generate @xmath66 model seds with a broad range of star formation histories , ages , stellar metallicities , dust content , and nebular emission - line strength .",
    "we use the flexible stellar population synthesis models ( fsps , v  2.4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) based on the miles stellar library @xcite and assume the @xcite initial mass function from @xmath67 .",
    "we adopt _ delayed _ star - formation histories , @xmath68 , where sfr is the star formation rate , @xmath69 is the time since the onset of star formation ( `` age '' ) , and @xmath70 is the characteristic time for star formation .",
    "the advantage of this parameterization is that it allows for both linearly rising ( @xmath71 ) and exponentially declining ( @xmath72 ) star formation histories , which may be important for modeling the seds of galaxies at the highest redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for our photometric redshift calculations we adopt uniform priors on age @xmath73 $ ]  gyr , star formation timescale @xmath74 $ ]  gyr , stellar metallicity @xmath75 $ ] , and rest - frame @xmath76-band attenuation @xmath77 $ ]  mag , assuming the time - dependent attenuation curve of @xcite .",
    "each model also includes nebular emission lines whose luminosity is tied self - consistently to the number of hydrogen - ionizing photons .",
    "we find that isedfit and bpz yield statistically consistent photometric redshifts for the majority of the candidates ; the mean difference is @xmath78 ( isedfit minus bpz ) , which is well within our quoted photometric redshift uncertainties . in a few cases",
    "isedfit prefers a lower - redshift solution , @xmath79 ; however , in every case these lower - redshift solutions require a highly unlikely combination of physical properties , namely low stellar masses , low star - formation rates , and large amounts of dust attenuation .",
    "secondary peaks in the redshift probability distribution from isedfit , on the other hand , place these candidates at @xmath65 , in agreement with bpz s primary redshift probability peaks .",
    "to help corroborate the high - redshift nature of our 24 candidates , we search for potential counter images near the locations predicted by the gravitational lensing model . among the candidates that are inside or near the @xmath80 critical curves , jd1 @xcite and zd7 are the only two cases where multiple images are found . for the others ,",
    "the predicted counter images are either behind bright foreground galaxies , or too faint to be confirmed .",
    "two of the counter images predicted for source zd10 are near that of zd11 , which have been discussed by a14 ( system 5 ) .",
    "the triple system zd7 is shown in figure  [ fig - arc ] and table  [ tbl - ms ] .",
    "image a is an arclet made of two components that are separated only by @xmath81 kpc in the source plane , assuming a magnification of six .",
    "this is similar to a case in abell  1689 where a pair of lbgs at @xmath82 may be merging @xcite .",
    "image b is behind a bright foreground galaxy , which we subtract before carrying out photometry .",
    "we make use of the pure geometric scaling induced by strong lensing to estimate a purely geometric distance for this triply imaged case .",
    "the zitrin `` nfw '' lensing model described in ",
    "[ sec : models ] is based on eleven sets of multiply lensed galaxies between @xmath83 , including a spectroscopic redshift of system  6 at @xmath84 ( j. richard , in preparation ) .",
    "this spectroscopic redshift provides a normalization of the model so that the deflection field induced in the lens plane , @xmath85 , can be scaled to any redshift via the lensing source distance ratio @xmath86 to provide the observed deflection field @xmath87 .",
    "hence only a simple scaling of the relative lensing distance ratios is required to relate deflections at any given redshift to the lensing distance of the normalization used to calibrate the lens model , which in our case is @xmath88 .",
    "we find that this factor is @xmath89 for the triple system which minimizes the location of the observed images relative to that generated by the model , and this corresponds to a best bpz estimate of @xmath2 .",
    "a possible faint fourth image d is noted between images a and b , close to another bright galaxy ( figure  5 ) .",
    "our paper serves as an independent verification of dropout objects in other reports , including the recent work of @xcite ( a14 hereafter ) , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most of the 15 candidates in a14 are at @xmath90 , and therefore have only limited overlap with ours .",
    "three of their candidates have been independently identified by us , but with somewhat different photometric redshifts .",
    "object zd9 in table  [ tbl - z7 ] , with @xmath91 , corresponds to a14 s object 561 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "object zd2 ( @xmath93 ) is a14 s object 2070 ( @xmath94 ) , object y1 ( @xmath95 ) in @xcite and object 2493 - 2561 in @xcite",
    ". object zd11 ( @xmath91 ) is a14 s object 5.2 ( @xmath96 ) and system 17 ( @xmath97 ) in @xcite .",
    "the close pair of zd3/zd6 ( @xmath98 ) are marked by a14 as object 2070 ( @xmath94 ) and object 2555 - 2516 in @xcite .",
    "objects yd4 , yd7 , yd8 , yd10 , zd2 , zd3 , zd5 are objects 2493 - 2561 , 2481 - 2561 , 2306 - 3090 , 2355 - 2566 , 2508 - 2497 , 2555 - 2516 , 2136 - 2432 in @xcite , respectively .    the irac2 flux of object zd2 ( y1 in @xcite ) is more than three times the irac1 value , which suggests a strong balmer break .",
    "a similar case at @xmath99 was reported in abell  383 @xcite in which both the irac1 and irac2 magnitudes are higher than the  photometry by 1.6 magnitude . at redshift @xmath100 ,",
    "the balmer break is in the irac1 band , and the model prediction is higher than the measured irac1 flux .",
    "in addition to reporting on the discovery of our high - redshift candidates , we can also begin to characterize their physical properties .",
    "we defer a more detailed analysis of the full sample to a forthcoming paper . here",
    ", we focus on the ten objects at @xmath65 with the highest - confidence photometric redshifts which have well - measured photometry in at least one irac channel .",
    "photometry redward of the balmer break is particularly important for placing meaningful constraints on the stellar mass and age of the stellar populations in these distant objects .    to infer the physical properties of these galaxies we use isedfit , but adopt a more restricted set of priors than the ones used to estimate photometric redshifts ( see  [ sec : photoz ] ) .",
    "specifically , we adopt uniform priors on galaxy age @xmath101 $ ]  myr , @xmath102 $ ]  myr , stellar metallicity @xmath103 $ ] , and we assume no dust attenuation ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "recall that the age of the universe at @xmath104 in our adopted concordance cosmology is @xmath105  myr .",
    "we find that our @xmath65 candidates have demagnified stellar masses of around @xmath106  , and sfrs of approximately @xmath107  yr@xmath10 . these results imply an average doubling time of around @xmath108  myr , which is comparable to the age of the universe at @xmath109 . of the stellar mass formed",
    "is returned to the interstellar medium via supernovae and stellar winds . ]",
    "the ages of the galaxies in our sample are less well constrained given the uncertainties in our irac photometry ; nevertheless , we find a median sfr - weighted age for the sample of @xmath110  myr ( @xmath111 confidence interval ) , corresponding to a typical formation redshift of @xmath112 .",
    "figure  [ fig - sed ] presents the seds of four representative galaxies in our sample , sorted by decreasing redshift , as well as the maximum likelihood fits derived using isedfit .",
    "an apparent concentration of candidates northeast of the cluster center is shown in figure  [ fig - fov ] .",
    "nine objects at @xmath113 are found within a region of @xmath7 .",
    "since the average magnification in that area is not high ( @xmath114 ) , this apparent overdensity is likely intrinsic rather than being due to lensing .",
    "in addition , figure  7 shows a small region `` quintet '' where five candidates are located within approximately @xmath115 of one another : objects yd1 , yd4 , yd6 , yd7 and zd1 . these objects have similar estimated photometric redshifts of between 7.9 and 8.6 , and their projected separations in the source plane are within @xmath116  kpc .",
    "given the uncertainties in our photometric redshifts , it is therefore possible that these sources are physically associated .    to estimate the uncertainties in irac photometry for these sources whose separations are close to the irac psf size , we place 500 sets of simulated sources of different brightness and compared the input and fitted fluxes . in more than 68% of the cases , the fitted results are within 0.5 mag of the inputs for three brighter sources in the f160w band , while for the faintest source the output flux decreases with the f160w - irac color . due to the source confusion",
    ", our simulations suggest that the de - blending with galfit works better for the brighter objects , while it is biased to fainter objects in the sense that their fluxes are likely to be overestimated .",
    "this is because that galfit often crashes under a very faint flux level .",
    "we therefore conclude that we are able to deblend these sources with reasonable accuracy , except for the faint source zd1 with large uncertainties .",
    "overdensities in the high - redshift domain have been previously reported .",
    "for example , @xcite identified four candidates with @xmath100 within @xmath117 in the field  borg58 .",
    "@xcite found seven lbgs at @xmath55 in the wfc3/ir field ( @xmath118 ) of abell 1703 .",
    "however , our finding of nine lbgs at @xmath119 within @xmath7 ( @xmath120  kpc in the source plane ) is unique , suggesting that the cosmic variance in source density @xcite is more significant than anticipated .",
    "it appears that cosmic variance increases with redshift @xcite , as evidenced by different results from surveys .",
    "this trend might explain both the large number of clustered @xmath100 sources and the deficiency of @xmath21 sources and illustrate the need for observations in more fields .",
    "we find 24 lbg candidates at @xmath121 in the hff imaging of , reaching an intrinsic magnitude of @xmath122 .",
    "one source at @xmath2 is lensed into three images .",
    "significant clustering is observed on the intrinsic scale of @xmath123  kpc .",
    "thanks to gravitational lensing , we are able to carry out spitzer / irac photometry for 16 of the sources . sed fitting to the brightest candidates suggests stellar masses of @xmath124  , star - formation rates of @xmath125  per year , and a typical formation redshift of @xmath126 .    the redshift distribution of our sample is not a smoothly declining function towards higher redshift . in particular , our redshift distribution does not extend smoothly beyond @xmath127 , clustering notwithstanding , considering the effect of cosmic variance , the number density in our sample is consistent with that derived from other studies , _ e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "given the level of clustering that we see in , it will be important to average over more hff , and to perform a luminosity function analysis so that the redshift dependence can be better related to galaxy mass .",
