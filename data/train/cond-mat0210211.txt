    "the problem of electron motion in a disordered conductor in a periodic potential and strong magnetic field displays a rich combination of phenomena of both classical and quantum origin .",
    "the complexity arises from the appearance of two independent types of periodicities , of the potential and of the cyclotron orbits , which may interplay in complicated ways .",
    "perhaps the most striking effect is known as weiss oscillations@xcite , whereby very large oscillations in the resistivity are induced by even a weak periodic potential at moderate magnetic fields . at different magnetic fields or temperatures , other types of contributions to the resistivity",
    "become significant .",
    "for example , at very small fields , a positive magnetoresistance results from a classical mechanism of channeling of orbits@xcite . at larger magnetic fields ,",
    "the resistivity develops shubnikov  de haas oscillations , which originate from the onset of landau quantization and may still be affected by the periodic potential@xcite . at even higher fields , the integer quantum hall effect@xcite ( iqhe ) becomes operative due to the contribution of quantum interference processes .",
    "much of the above phenomenology has been thoroughly analyzed theoretically , by a variety of techniques including quantum mechanical approaches@xcite involving diagrammatics@xcite or solution of a quantum boltzmann equation@xcite , and quasiclassical approaches@xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of these systems is also well advanced@xcite with precise confirmation of the theoretical predictions already possible .",
    "so far however a theory for the influence of quantum interference processes in a periodic potential and high magnetic field has been missing .",
    "such processes lead to weak localization corrections to the conductivity which become significant at low temperatures ( see e.g. refs.@xcite for reviews ) . at high magnetic fields",
    ", they are also responsible for the operation of the iqhe@xcite , whereby the hall conductivity becomes quantized at low temperatures . at the same time",
    ", the observation of the iqhe in systems with a weak potential modulation is well within current experimental capability@xcite .",
    "this paper aims to fill this gap by showing how the standard theory for weak localization and the iqhe may be generalized so as to incorporate the presence of a periodic potential .",
    "we employ a field - theory approach based on a nonlinear @xmath0 model@xcite which is well established in the study of mesoscopic disordered conductors . in deriving the appropriate field theory ,",
    "we are able to show how previous theoretical calculations of the conductivity , within both quasiclassical@xcite and quantum mechanical approaches@xcite , may be recovered in a natural way within the field theory formalism .",
    "this enables us to extend previous theoretical results in a consistent way so as to include the influence of quantum interference processes .",
    "the experiments of weiss _ et al_.@xcite employed weakly modulated two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems of high mobility with a well - known period , @xmath1 , much less than the mean free path , @xmath2 .",
    "such samples were engineered using a holographic modulation technique , based on the persistent photoconductivity effect in gaas / al@xmath3ga@xmath4as heterostructures at low temperatures @xmath5 .",
    "the weiss oscillations appear in only one component of the resistivity tensor , @xmath6 , when the modulation is in the @xmath7 direction .",
    "furthermore they appear at magnetic fields @xmath8 such that the cyclotron radius @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath11 is the electron charge and @xmath12 is the fermi velocity ) satisfies the commensurability condition @xmath13 , for integer @xmath14 .",
    "hence the oscillations are periodic in @xmath15 .",
    "in addition they are relatively stable with respect to temperature , suggesting a quasiclassical origin .    at even higher magnetic fields , such that the cyclotron radius is much less than the period of modulation ( @xmath16 )",
    ", the quasiclassical theory predicts that the @xmath6 component shows a large , nonoscillatory increase proportional to @xmath17 , leading to a strong positive magnetoresistance .",
    "this result has been confirmed in experiments@xcite for which the temperature was kept deliberately high so as to avoid the intervention of the iqhe .",
    "a limitation of the quasiclassical approach is that it fails to account for the renormalization of single - particle properties , such as the density of states and scattering lifetime , by the strong magnetic field according to landau quantization . even in unmodulated samples",
    ", quantization leads to oscillations in the density of states with respect to magnetic fields , and hence to shubnikov  de haas oscillations in the resistivity . in samples with the periodic potential , the shubnikov ",
    "de haas oscillations start to appear at higher magnetic fields than the weiss oscillations ( for @xmath18 an integer multiple of the fermi wavelength @xmath19 ) .",
    "a quantum - mechanical approach that does allow for such quantization effects has been provided by zhang and gerhardts@xcite ( see also peeters and vasilopoulos@xcite ) ; it is a diagrammatic treatment that generalizes the approach of ando and co ",
    "workers@xcite to modulated samples .",
    "the quantum - mechanical approach is then capable of describing both weiss oscillations and the shubnikov  de haas oscillations ( also affected by the modulation ) at higher magnetic fields .    in principle , the calculation of weak localization corrections in a strong magnetic field ( unitary ensemble ) is possible even in the presence of a periodic potential , by a generalization of the diagrammatic approach of zhang and gerhardts@xcite , but the procedure would be complicated ( although the simpler orthogonal case has been examined diagrammatically for a periodic magnetic field@xcite ) . instead , the calculation of high - order diagrams is more convenient in the field - theory formalism and , furthermore , with this method the possibility exists of calculating contributions of diagrams to all orders by the renormalization - group technique .",
    "we show how the field - theory takes the form of a nonlinear @xmath0 model with a topological term  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian is slightly nonstandard since it contains an anisotropy in the coefficients , corresponding to the difference between the longitudinal conductivities in the @xmath7 and @xmath20 directions , due to the periodic potential .",
    "the effect of weak localization corrections to the conductivity for unmodulated samples is accounted for by a scaling ( one - parameter scaling ) of the conductivity with the system size . as a first step",
    "we derive the analog of the one - parameter scaling for the conductivity@xcite in the modulated system by means of a perturbative rg analysis of the effective lagrangian .",
    "we then turn to the study of the iqhe , implementing a generalization of a two - parameter scaling , which has been conjectured@xcite as a model for the iqhe in unmodulated systems .",
    "we examine how the resistivity tensor should be affected at low temperatures by the iqhe in modulated samples for parameters that are realizable in actual experiments .",
    "we see , for example , how the hall conductivity becomes quantized under scaling at low temperatures , while in the regions between the plateaus the longitudinal conductivities develop peaks of differing heights according to the anisotropy in the @xmath7 and @xmath20 directions .",
    "_ in the following , we employ the hamiltonian for the disordered conductor in a magnetic field and periodic potential in two dimensions :    @xmath21    here @xmath22 is the vector potential , so that @xmath23 , where @xmath8 is the perpendicular , uniform magnetic field",

    "in this section we describe a field - theoretical approach to the description of a disordered conductor in the presence of a periodic potential and a strong magnetic field .",
    "the approach is based on a diffusive nonlinear @xmath0 model , which will serve as a tool for the analysis of quantum interference effects in the remainder of this paper . in section [ mainfindings ]",

    ", the field - theory technique provides a convenient means of calculating weak localization corrections to the conductivity , a task that may become very cumbersome by the more conventional technique of diagrammatics@xcite .",

    "( [ diffaction ] ) is known as a topological term and appears in the theory of the iqhe proposed by pruisken and collaborators@xcite .",
    "the influence of the extra term does not appear within perturbation theory , but becomes evident only through a nonperturbative analysis .",
    "such an analysis has been conjectured@xcite in the form of a two - parameter renormalization - group procedure .",
    "the two parameters are the longitudinal and hall conductivities that follow coupled scaling equations with respect to changes of length scale .",
    "while the validity of the two - parameter scaling has been vigorously debated ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it has remained a valuable guide to experimental@xcite and numerical@xcite data for a number of years . in the following ,",
    "we take a pragmatic approach by not contesting the validity of the two - parameter scaling and its relation to the proposed field theory . instead",
    ", we assume its validity and explore how it may be generalized to take account of the periodic potential .",
    "the main difference of the lagrangian ( [ diffaction ] ) from the unmodulated case is the anisotropy in the diffusion coefficients for the @xmath7 and @xmath20 directions .",
    "the lagrangian , therefore , contains three , rather than two parameters , which scale together under changes of length scale . a simple scale transformation , however , maps the lagrangian to an isotropic version for which the usual two - parameter scaling may be applied",
    ".    this lagrangian applies in the diffusive limit , that is , to configurations of the @xmath38 field that vary on scales much longer than the mean free path .",
    "this allows the calculation of the contribution of low - momentum relaxational modes to weak localization corrections to the conductivity .",
    "although momentum relaxation is diffusive on large length scales , electron motion on the scale of the periodic potential is ballistic , since the modulation period is much less than the mean free path .",
    "to arrive at the above lagrangian it is therefore necessary to integrate over degrees of freedom corresponding to length much smaller than the mean free path .",
    "one way to do so is to start from a description of ballistic electron motion on length scales much less than the mean free path .",
    "such a description is provided by the `` ballistic @xmath0 model''@xcite which , as the name suggests , generalizes the diffusive @xmath0 model to the ballistic regime .",
    "starting from this model we show in sec .",
    "[ derivation ] how the contribution from short length scales may be integrated out .",
    "the result is the lagrangian of a diffusive @xmath0 model that describes the interaction of diffusion modes on scales longer than the mean free path .",
    "when derived in this way , the effective lagrangian takes the form of eq .",
    "( [ diffaction ] ) , but with the @xmath40 coefficients replaced by @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath42 correspond precisely to the components of the quasiclassical conductivity tensor as derived from the boltzmann equation for the modulated system @xcite .",
    "one finds that , in the quasiclassical approach , only the xx component of the quasiclassical resistivity tensor is affected by the modulation , all other components being the same as in the unmodulated case , so that @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( here @xmath45 is the diffusion coefficient in dimension @xmath46 ) . for details of the solution of the boltzmann equation ,",
    "we refer the reader to beenakker@xcite . here",
    "we only remark that for moderate magnetic fields , weak enough that the cyclotron radius is much larger than the modulation period ( @xmath47 ) , but strong enough that @xmath48 , the quasiclassical result simplifies to    @xmath49    equation .",
    "( [ been2 ] ) demonstrates the oscillatory dependence of the resistivity known as weiss oscillations . for strong magnetic fields , such that @xmath50 , a very large oscillatory increase in @xmath6 proportional to @xmath17 is predicted and has been observed experimentally in , e.g. , geim et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , for high magnetic fields ( @xmath51 ) , the quasiclassical results are reliable only at sufficiently high temperatures ( @xmath52 ) , while at lower temperatures the effects of quantization on single - particle properties such as the density of states must be taken into account by a quantum - mechanical approach .",
    "these effects are not taken into account in the derivation via the ballistic @xmath0 model , since here the magnetic field is treated only as a weak perturbation . indeed ,",
    "once temperatures are low enough for weak localization corrections to be significant ( @xmath53 ) , then quantization is already well established ( as @xmath54 , since @xmath48 ) .",
    "hence this method of deriving the lagrangian is unfortunately of no use in describing the effects of quantum interference processes at high magnetic fields .",
    "an improvement on this situation may be found by proceeding instead along a second route to derive the effective lagrangian , following more closely the original lines of pruisken@xcite .",
    "he showed how to derive a @xmath0 model in the presence of a strong magnetic field , including the effects of quantization .",

    "( [ diffaction ] ) , now the @xmath40 coefficients correspond precisely to @xmath55 , where @xmath56 are the components of the conductivity tensor calculated in the fully quantum - mechanical approach of ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the effects of quantization are included this approach correctly describes certain features that are observed in experiment but are beyond the quasiclassical approach .",

    "indeed , at vanishingly low temperatures , the quasiclassical result becomes unjustified for all magnetic fields .",

    "et al_.@xcite have also studied the iqhe in modulated samples ; in their work however they have not focused on the regime of a weak periodic potential or effects that are independent of the device boundaries .",
    "in this paper we have considered transport properties of a disordered conductor in a periodic potential and strong magnetic field .",
    "we focused on the contribution of quantum interference processes , whose influence at high fields is missing from previous approaches despite being responsible for a whole class of phenomena .",
    "for example , they lead to weak localization corrections to the conductivity and the operation of the iqhe at high magnetic fields . to this end , we introduced a field - theory approach , which is well established in the study of unmodulated disordered conductors .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the field theory takes the form of a nonlinear @xmath0 model , which describes the interaction of diffusion modes on large length scales .",
    "the presence of the strong magnetic field leads to an extra , topological term in the lagrangian .",
    "the form of the lagrangian is the same as for unmodulated systems , except for an anisotropy in the coefficients corresponding to the bare longitudinal conductivities in the @xmath7 and @xmath20 directions .",
    "we provided two different routes to deriving the lagrangian .",
    "the first route was via a so - called `` ballistic '' @xmath0 model , and demonstrated how the results of the quasiclassical approach@xcite may be recovered within the field - theory formalism .",
    "the drawback of this route , in common with the quasiclassical approximation , is that it neglects the renormalization of single - particle properies by landau quantization .",
    "consequently the resulting lagrangian was too approximate to be useful in determining weak localization properties at low temperatures .",
    "the second route improved on this situation by including the effects of landau quantization .",
    "it bypasses a derivation of a ballistic @xmath0 model and instead follows more closely the original derivation of pruisken@xcite for unmodulated systems .",
    "indeed , while the first route contained more parallels with the quasiclassical approach , the second route contained more parallels with the quantum - mechanical approach@xcite for the bare conductivity tensor .",
    "having derived the effective lagrangian , we showed how it leads to the scaling of the conductivity tensor under changes of length scale ( and hence temperature ) . a perturbative renormalization - group analysis of the free energy leads to a generalization , to modulated systems , of one - parameter scaling for the longitudinal conductivities .",
    "perturbatively , the hall conductivity is unrenormalized . in the regime of weiss",
    "oscillations@xcite , weak localization corrections give rise to an additional oscillatory dependence of the longitudinal conductivities as a function of the magnetic field . due to their smallness , these corrections may , however , be hard to detect experimentally .    in order to describe the iqhe ,",
    "whereby the hall conductivity becomes quantized at low temperatures , a nonperturbative analysis of the lagrangian is necessary .",
    "this is provided by the conjecture of the two - parameter scaling for unmodulated systems . assuming the validity of this conjecture and the underlying instanton gas approximation , we have shown how the two - parameter scaling may be generalized to the case of the modulated system .",
    "this has allowed us to illustrate the evolution of the resistivity tensor under the iqhe for parameters that are realistic for experiments .",
    "we find , for example , that the ratio of the two longitudinal components of the conductivity remains constant under scaling ( an observation that does not itself depend on the assumptions used to derive the flow equations ) .",
    "while the hall conductivity still becomes quantized under scaling in the modulated system , between the plateaus the longitudinal conductivities develop peaks of differing heights due to the anisotropy in the system .",
    "there are several directions in which our analysis may be generalized .",
    "a simple generalization is to consider a periodic magnetic field , rather than potential , a situation which leads to a similar phenomenology@xcite .",
    "the derivation of the field theory for this case follows very similar lines to the case of a periodic potential , with similar results .",
    "another direction in which the analysis may be extended straightforwardly is to the study of the low magnetic field regime , in which a positive magnetoresistance has been observed@xcite and explained within a quasiclassical approach@xcite .",
    "as long as @xmath221 , one may derive the field theory for this regime according to the first route of sec .",
    "[ sec : sigma ] , neglecting quantization ; the coefficients of the field theory then coincide with the components of the conductivity tensor derived within the boltzmann approach .",
    "the weak localization to the conductivity ( or related quantities such as the dephasing time@xcite ) may then be calculated using the lagrangian for either the orthogonal or the unitary ensemble , or in the crossover between the pure symmetry classes .",
    "a less straightforward generalization is to improve on the cna approximation of the quantum - mechanical approach and its analog in the field - theory formalism .",
    "according to this approximation , the self - energy matrix ( and the saddle point solution of the @xmath33 matrix ) are assumed to have a trivial structure in the space of landau indices and coordinate @xmath152 .",
    "while this simplifies the analysis considerably , we have seen already how this approximation breaks down for very high magnetic fields , such that the cyclotron radius is much less than the period of modulation , @xmath16 .",
    "improvement on the cna is necessary , not only for such high fields , but also to study models of disorder with long - range correlations , for which vertex corrections are not negligible .",
    "such models have been analyzed in the quasiclassical approach@xcite and shown to represent experimental data more closely in certain respects .",
    "very recently it has been shown how to improve on the cna@xcite within the quantum - mechanical approach , so as to analyze models at high magnetic fields or with long - range disorder correlations . in the field theory formalism ,",
    "improvement on the cna approximation would require enlarging the space of the @xmath33 matrix even further to include the additional matrix structure in the space of landau indices , as well as a dependence on @xmath152 .",
    "inclusion of such a structure within the @xmath33 field is to our knowledge a novel direction to pursue , although this task is left as a future project .",
    "a further area to explore is the case of a strong periodic potential , for which the first - order perturbative expansion in the potential that we use is no longer valid .",
    "while an analytical approach would be very difficult , a numerical treatment would be better suited to this regime . for a strong enough potential that @xmath144 is of the order of @xmath222 , the smearing of the landau levels is so great that they can no longer be individually resolved even at low temperatures .",
    "this leads to a quenching of the shubnikov  de haas oscillations ( as noted by beton _",

    "<S> we consider magnetotransport in a disordered two - dimensional electron gas in the presence of a periodic modulation in one direction . </S>",
    "<S> existing quasiclassical and quantum approaches to this problem account for weiss oscillations in the resistivity tensor at moderate magnetic fields , as well as a strong modulation - induced modification of the shubnikov  de haas oscillations at higher magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> they do not account , however , for the operation at even higher magnetic fields of the integer quantum hall effect , for which quantum interference processes are responsible . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a field theory approach , based on a nonlinear @xmath0 model , which encompasses naturally both the quasiclassical and quantum mechanical approaches , as well as providing a consistent means of extending them to include quantum interference corrections . </S>",
    "<S> a perturbative renormalization - group analysis of the field theory shows how weak localization corrections to the conductivity tensor may be described by a modification of the usual one - parameter scaling , such as to accommodate the anisotropy of the bare conductivity tensor . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how the two - parameter scaling , conjectured as a model for the quantum hall effect in unmodulated systems , may be generalized similarly for the modulated system . within this model </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the operation of the quantum hall effect in modulated systems for parameters that are realistic for current experiments . </S>"
