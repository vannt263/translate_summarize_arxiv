    "substantial populations of intergalactic qso absorption - line systems have been detected in highly - ionized oxygen ( ) with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) . because they are probably hot ( @xmath8  k )",
    ", these absorbers may represent a portion of the `` missing baryons '' that are predicted ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",
    "1999 ) to arise at low redshift from continuous structure formation in the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) .",
    "early surveys of these absorbers with hst ( tripp , savage , & jenkins 2000 ; savage et al .",
    "2002 , tripp 2005 ) found unexpectedly high number densities per unit redshift , @xmath0/@xmath1  @xmath9 , down to 30 - 50 m  sensitivity .",
    "the recent _ fuse _ study by danforth & shull ( 2005 , hereafter ds05 ) has refined these estimates of @xmath0/@xmath1  and measured their column density distribution , @xmath0/@xmath10 .",
    "ds05 assumed uniform 0.1 solar metallicity ( [ o / h ] @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 k to estimate the total contribution of the absorbers to the baryon density , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 ( spergel et al . 2003 ) km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 ) @xmath16 . ] .",
    "the _ fuse _ data can not measure the gas metallicity precisely but they allow for estimates of typical values .",
    "ds05 detect 40 absorbers which span 2.5 dex in @xmath17 ( ) but only 1.5 dex in @xmath17 ( ) . by combining photoionization and collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) models with a theoretical relation between igm density and @xmath18 , ds05 derive a typical metallicity of @xmath19 .",
    "we derive a conservative lower limit [ o / h ] @xmath20 from a pure cie model that matches the broad locus of points in figure 1 of ds05 , assuming the maximum fractional ionization , @xmath21 , of at @xmath22 k. however , according to equation 6 of ds05 this metallicity limit implies @xmath23 , close to the total cosmic baryon density . because a major portion of the whim is thought to lie in hotter gas accessible only to x - ray telescopes ( fang et al .",
    "2002 ; mathur , weinberg , & chen 2003 ; mckernan et al .",
    "2003 ; nicastro et al .",
    "2005 ) , it is likely that the true metallicity of these absorbers lies closer to the fiducial value [ o / h ] @xmath11 assumed by ds05 .",
    "metallicity [ o / h ] @xmath24 in @xmath25% of the detected ly@xmath26 clouds ( ds05 ) is too high and too common to have been in place by @xmath27 , where schaye et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find filling factors of 2 ",
    "10% for gas with [ c / h ] @xmath28 . the",
    "absorbers therefore imply significant later enrichment by galaxies .",
    "conversely , if the metallicities of these absorbers lie near our lower limits , a portion of the sample would need to be removed to limit their cosmic density .",
    "thus the mean metallicity , the dispersion in the metallicity , and the possibility of other mechanisms for producing are essential to understanding the contribution of absorbers to @xmath29 .    to produce detectable absorption , an intervening cloud must ( 1 ) have the proper ionization conditions to ionize oxygen to , and ( 2 ) have sufficient metallicity to make the lines strong enough to detect .",
    "the first condition can be met in cie gas produced in shocks ( shull & mckee 1979 ) or in hot - cold interfaces ( fox et al .",
    "2004 ; indebetouw & shull 2004 , and references therein ) , though for some igm conditions photoionization by a metagalactic ionizing background ( haardt & madau 1996 ) can also produce .",
    "the ionization mechanism need not be caused by , nor occur near , a galaxy , but in the standard picture of structure formation metals must be created in galaxies . when absorber / galaxy relationships are considered , there is no necessary connection between galaxies and the _ ionization _ of the gas , while there is a necessary connection between galaxies and the _ metallicity _ of the gas .",
    "thus even if the absorbers fill only a portion of the igm hot - gas budget , they can still constrain the distribution of metals . in this paper",
    "we study the dispersal of igm metals by galaxies using only _ observables _ and simple geometric arguments .",
    "our model does not attempt to explain the shock - heating or photoionization mechanisms that cause or maintain the ionization of , but rather the metals that must have some link to nearby galaxies .",
    "our model has significant advantages over simulations ( cen et al .",
    "2002 ; fang & bryan 2001 ; chen et al .",
    "2003 ; yoshida et al .",
    "2005 ) or semi - analytic calculations ( furlanetto et al .",
    "2005 ) that predict @xmath0/@xmath1  from _ a priori _ models .",
    "these models either do not treat metal distribution in a self - consistent way , by adopting a uniform or density - dependent metallicity , or they use complicated models to calculate ionization structures and obtain reasonable ionization fractions .",
    "by contrast , our model avoids all these complicated issues . by decoupling these entangled physical processes",
    ", we can then focus on key issues , namely the volume that can be enriched by galaxies , and the minimum luminosity of the galaxies that can enrich the nearby igm .",
    "our method also allows us to evaluate the hypothesis that the intergalactic absorbers are related to the hvcs seen in the galaxy . combining some simple geometrical arguments we derive the expected column density distribution , @xmath0/@xmath10 .",
    "when compared with observations , our simple model provides significant constraints on the distribution of metals and their connection with galaxies .",
    "our model compares the distribution of igm metals expressed by @xmath0/@xmath1  to the incidence of qso - galaxy `` pairs '' expected per redshift interval .",
    "we calculate the total number of absorbers @xmath30 that can be encountered by one random sightline along a distance @xmath31 to a background qso .",
    "the spatial density of halos with absolute magnitude between @xmath32 and @xmath33 is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 will ultimately be determined by sdss . assuming each halo can enrich the surrounding volume to a radius of @xmath36 , the total number of such intercepted absorbers within a distance of @xmath31 along the line of sight ( los ) toward background quasars then is @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the los covering fraction , representing the chances of intercepting absorbers within each halo . in the next section we will see that @xmath39 when we relate the local high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) and the intergalactic absorbers .    in principle the integral in the last term of equation 1",
    "could be stated in terms of mass and derived from , e.g. a press - schechter function , but in practice we use observations .",
    "we begin with the sdss data release 3 catalog of qsos ( all spectroscopically confirmed ) and galaxies . to maximize the size of the sample and",
    "therefore provide good statistics , we use all sdss photometric sources determined to be galaxies by photometric selection , then calculate photometric redshifts , @xmath40 , from the sdss @xmath41 photometry using the software of blanton et al .",
    "these redshifts have typical errors @xmath42 , which make individual pairs quite uncertain but which wash out in the average .",
    "for each qso sightline , we assign to all galaxies within 42@xmath43 an impact parameter @xmath44 to the qso sightline at the galaxy @xmath40 .",
    "we require @xmath45 to minimize spurious detections on the low end and incompleteness at the high end .",
    "we correct for incompleteness in faint galaxies at the higher redshifts by assigning each galaxy ( or magnitude bin of galaxies ) a unique pathlength @xmath46 based on its absolute magnitude and the sdss flux limits .",
    "then , for a given spherical `` halo '' or `` enrichment '' radius @xmath36 and a los covering fraction @xmath38 , we can derive the total number and @xmath0/@xmath1of pairs , with cuts for any galaxy property ( i.e. , color , morphology , luminosity ) measurable from the @xmath41 photometry and @xmath47 .",
    "figure  [ dndzfig ] shows differential and cumulative distributions of @xmath0/@xmath1  achieved by galaxies of varying @xmath48 , given a uniform impact parameter @xmath44 and @xmath49 .",

    "this mapping between galaxy populations and absorber incidence is the major result of this study .",
    "spherical enrichment zones must be quite large , @xmath51 mpc , and uniform ( @xmath49 ) for enrichment by massive galaxies ( @xmath52 ) to explain the observed numbers of absorbers . for @xmath53 kpc , low - mass galaxies ( @xmath54 ) can reproduce the observed @xmath0/@xmath1 . to obtain @xmath0/@xmath1= 21 with dwarf galaxies only , we require uniform @xmath55 kpc for @xmath56 to @xmath57 and @xmath58 kpc for @xmath59 to @xmath57 .",
    "in passing we note our model can also constrain @xmath36 for halos corresponding to high-@xmath17 ( ) ly@xmath26 clouds , i.e. @xmath60 kpc at @xmath52 is needed to reproduce @xmath0/@xmath1  = 1 for lyman limit systems ( keeney et al .",

    "the behavior of @xmath0/@xmath10  at low @xmath17 is of critical importance to estimating @xmath65 .",
    "however , below @xmath6 ( ) @xmath66 , the observed numbers of absorbers drop below the power - law fit , and well below the numbers expected from simulations that assume uniform or overdensity - dependent metallicity in the whim ( figure  [ dndnfig ] ) .",
    "ds05 can not say whether the apparent turnover below @xmath6 ( ) @xmath67 13.5 is real or due to survey incompleteness below @xmath68 m . integrating this power law down to @xmath6 ( ) = 13.0 ( 12.5 m ) yields @xmath0/@xmath1  = 106 .",
    "this high number density requires [ o / h ] @xmath69 over @xmath70 kpc spheres for @xmath71 ( figure 1 ) , an unlikely outcome .",
    "we believe it is more likely that the observed turnover below @xmath6 ( ) @xmath67 13.5 is real and not a consequence of incompleteness in the ds05 survey .",
    "this prediction could be verified by a survey with more pathlength coverage down to @xmath6 ( ) = 13.0 ( 12.5 m ) .",
    "if this deficit relative to theoretical expectations is real , our model suggests that metals are not as widely or uniformly distributed throughout the low - density igm as simulations assume or find them to be .",
    "qso absorption - line studies of the dispersal of igm metals generally offer conflicting guidance because they suffer from the practical difficulty of identifying the faintest galaxy with which a given absorber might be associated .",
    "these studies can not generally exclude the presence of a faint galaxy nearer the sightline than a known bright one , and so they tend to overestimate the dispersal of metals .",
    "this effect is seen in the data points in figure 1 , which show @xmath32 and @xmath44 of nearest - neighbor galaxies to absorbers with galaxy surveys of varying depth and sky coverage .",
    "there is a general trend of metals spread to @xmath72 kpc , with some notable exceptions .",
    "the @xmath73 absorber toward pg0953 + 415 ( savage et al .",
    "2002 ) suggests @xmath74 solar enrichment to @xmath70 kpc , but this field has not been surveyed much below @xmath75 .",
    "the pks2155 - 304 absorbers ( shull , tumlinson , & giroux 2003 ) provide the best case for metal dispersal to @xmath76 kpc , because this field has been surveyed to @xmath77 , but the absorbers appear to be associated with a galaxy group that may complicate constraints on metal dispersal .",
    "chen et al . ( 2001 ) systematically studied near 50 galaxies over a range of luminosity and found @xmath78 at @xmath79 kpc and @xmath80 at @xmath81 kpc , with typical limiting @xmath82 m .",
    "this result does not rely on a post - facto galaxy survey , and so provides more robust evidence that luminous galaxies have associated metals out to @xmath83 kpc .",
    "stocke et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found a post - starburst dwarf with @xmath84 associated with a 6% solar metallicity absorber in the sightline to 3c  273 .",
    "this galaxy , while starbursting , apparently drove a metal - enriched superwind @xmath85 kpc into the igm .",
    "thus there is evidence that metal enrichment spreads to @xmath86 kpc from all galaxies , but evidence for further propagation is less clear .",
    "we stress that the known @xmath0/@xmath1  of absorbers represents the minimum budget of metals that must be explained in terms of enrichment by galaxies .",
    "there are surely other reservoirs of metals that meet condition 2 above ( detectable metallicity ) but not 1 ( conditions that produce ) .",
    "any difficulty associated with distributing the oxygen seen in can only be compounded by the addition of these other reservoirs ( e.g. , photoionized gas in systems ) to the budget of igm metals .",
    "finally , figure 1 shows results for @xmath87 and so presents the most optimistic case of enrichment .",
    "our model can also interpret the intergalactic o vi absorbers as analogs of the local highly - ionized high - velocity clouds ( sembach et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter s03 ) . to do so",
    ", we must first derive a mapping between the covering fraction , @xmath88 , of hvcs with column density @xmath17 as seen along radial sightlines out from the galaxy , to @xmath38 , the covering fraction along a los that follows a chord through an intervening galaxy halo .",
    "the key assumption here is that the hvcs are not _ unique _ , i.e. , an observer located in another galaxy similar to our galaxy should be able to detect similar hvcs with a similar pattern of column density distribution .",
    "let us first consider hvcs with column densities between @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and with a covering fraction @xmath91  the total covering fraction @xmath88 is the sum of @xmath91 .",
    "assuming there are a total of @xmath92 such absorbers uniformly distributed within the halo ( of a galaxy or a group ) , and each absorber has a spherical geometry with radius @xmath93 , we find @xmath92 and the spatial number density of the absorbers within the halo @xmath94 are @xmath95 respectively , where @xmath36 is the radius of the halo . these absorbers project onto the sky a total area @xmath96 , such that their covering fraction along the los is @xmath97    we derive all quantities from observation - @xmath91 from table 4 of s03 and the spatial density of galaxies from sdss .",
    "the total los covering fraction @xmath38 then is @xmath98 . adopting the value of @xmath88 from s03",
    ", we find @xmath38 ranges from @xmath99 to @xmath100 down to 30 m , which justifies the value of 1 we adopt in the previous section .",
    "our results appear in figure  [ dndnfig ] , where we show that hvc - like absorbers can make a significant contribution to the observed numbers if massive galaxies have large halos , or if all galaxies down to @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) have hvcs out to @xmath86 kpc .",
    "highly ionized gas can arise in galaxy superwinds ( heckman et al .",
    "2001 ) , in gas tidally stripped from galaxies ( cox et al .",
    "2004 ) , and in accreting gas ( maller & bullock 2004 ; birnboim & dekel 2002 ) . the @xmath84 dwarf 71@xmath103 kpc away from a metal - enriched absorber toward 3c  273 ( stocke et al .",
    "2004 ) is one example at the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "the _ fuse _ studies of galactic hvcs ( sembach et al .",
    "2003 ; fox et al .",
    "2004 ; collins , shull , giroux 2004 ) show that can arise in the extended halo regions of larger galaxies ( @xmath86 kpc ) and not necessarily correspond to the whim . from figure  [ dndnfig ] , it appears that if these processes have high @xmath38 out to @xmath86 kpc around galaxies down to @xmath104 , they may contribute @xmath0/@xmath1  @xmath105 to the overall population of absorbers . given the potentially important contributions of absorbers to @xmath106 , their utility as pointers to the hotter whim seen in x - ray absorption , and considering the many mechanisms that can produce near galaxies , it is important to obtain an unbiased observation of the incidence of and metals within @xmath107 kpc of galaxies over a range of mass .",
    "until such an observation is made , we can not know how to correct the inferred baryon densities for these contaminating effects .",
    "our observations can also guide the design of such studies by constraining the fields over which galaxy surveys must be executed .",
    "based on our model of the distribution of igm metals and the observed numbers of igm absorbers , we draw the following conclusions :    1 .   unless they eject metals to @xmath108 mpc , luminous galaxies can not explain @xmath0/@xmath1  for metal - line absorbers in the low-@xmath109 igm . if low - mass galaxies ( @xmath110 ) disperse metals to @xmath111 kpc , @xmath0/@xmath1  for the absorbers can be explained .",
    "uniform enrichment to @xmath112 1 mpc is implied by integrating the power - law dependence of @xmath0/@xmath10  ( ds05 ) to @xmath6 ( ) = 13.0 .",
    "thus the turnover seen by ds05 in @xmath0/@xmath10  below @xmath6 ( ) @xmath113 ( 50 m ) is more likely a real effect than a consequence of survey incompleteness .",
    "a survey sensitive to @xmath114 m  could confirm this result and further constrain the dispersal of igm metals .",
    "conversely , additional absorbers below @xmath6 ( ) @xmath113 would imply that metals are quite widespread .",
    "3 .   a high covering fraction of from `` hvcs '' within @xmath107 kpc from galaxies can contribute @xmath0/@xmath1  = @xmath115 , a non - negligible portion of the observed total that would not contribute to @xmath116 .",
