    "in the past several decades , a lot of work has been carried out to deal with the problem of steering a system to a target state , especially after the introduction of the notions of actuators and sensors @xcite . however , in many real - world applications , we are only concerned with those cases where the target states of the problem studied are defined in a given subregion of the whole space domain .",
    "then the regional idea emerges and we refer the reader to @xcite for more information on the concept of regional analysis for the gaussian diffusion process . besides , it should be pointed out that not only does the concept of regional analysis make sense closer to real - world problems , it also generalizes the results of existence contributions .",
    "in addition , after the introduction of continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) by montroll and weiss @xcite , the anomalous diffusion equation of fractional order has attracted increasing interest and has been proven to be a useful tool in modeling many real - world problems @xcite . more precisely , the mean squared displacement ( msd ) of anomalous diffusion process is described by a power law of fractional exponent , which is smaller ( in the case of sub - diffusion ) or bigger ( in the case of super - diffusion ) than that of brownian motion .",
    "it is confirmed that the time fractional diffusion system , where the traditional first order time derivative is replaced by a riemann - liouville time fractional derivative of order @xmath0 $ ] , can be used to well characterize those sub - diffusion process @xcite .",
    "for example , the flow through porous media microscopic processes @xcite , or swarm of robots moving through dense forest @xcite etc . for the fractional calculus ,",
    "as we all know , it has shown great potential in science and engineering applications and some phenomena such as self - similarity , nonstationary , non - gaussian process and short or long memory process are all closely related to fractional calculus @xcite .",
    "it is now widely believed that , using fractional calculus in modeling can better capture the complex dynamics of natural and man - made systems , and fractional order controls can offer better performance not achievable before using integer order controls @xcite , which in fact raise important theoretical challenges and open new research opportunities .    motivated by the argument above",
    ", the contribution of this present work is on the regional boundary controllability of the anomalous transport process described by time fractional diffusion systems .",

    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the mathematical concept of regional boundary controllability and several preliminaries are presented in the next section , then we present an example which is regional boundary controllability but not globally boundary controllable .",
