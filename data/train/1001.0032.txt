    "the main goal of the _ kepler mission _ is to characterize extra - solar planetary systems , particularly earth - like planets in the habitable zone ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the mission detects the presence of planets through the minute reduction of the light from a star as a planet crosses the line of sight .",
    "several observations of such reductions at fixed time intervals for a given star , and extensive follow - up observations , are used to verify that the effect results from planet transits and to characterize the planet . to ensure a reasonable chance of detection _",
    "kepler _ observes more than 100,000 stars simultaneously , in a fixed field in the cygnus - lyra region .",
    "most stars are observed at a cadence of 29.4 min , but a subset of up to 512 stars can be observed at a short cadence ( sc ) of 58.85s .",
    "_ kepler _ was launched on 6 march 2009 and data from the commissioning period and the first month of regular observations are now available .",
    "the very high photometric accuracy required to detect planet transits @xcite also makes the _ kepler _ observations of great interest for asteroseismic studies of stellar interiors .",
    "in particular , the sc data allow investigations of solar - like oscillations in main - sequence stars . apart from the great astrophysical interest of such investigations they also provide powerful tools to characterize stars that host planetary systems @xcite .    in stars with effective temperature @xmath0",
    "we expect to see oscillations similar to those observed in the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , excited stochastically by the near - surface convection .",
    "these are acoustic modes of high radial order ; in main - sequence stars such modes approximately satisfy the asymptotic relation @xmath1 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath2 is the cyclic frequency , @xmath3 is the radial order of the mode and @xmath4 is the degree , @xmath5 corresponding to radial ( i.e. , spherically symmetric ) oscillations .",
    "also , @xmath6 is essentially the inverse sound travel time across the stellar diameter ; this is closely related to the mean stellar density @xmath7 : @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 depends sensitively on conditions near the center of the star ; for stars during the central hydrogen burning phase this provides a measure of stellar age .",
    "finally , @xmath10 is determined by conditions near the stellar surface .",
    "this regular form of the frequency spectrum simplifies the analysis of the observations , and the close relation between the stellar properties and the parameters characterizing the frequencies make them efficient diagnostics of the properties of the star",

    "ground - based transit observations have identified three planetary systems in the _ kepler _ field : tres-2 @xcite , hat - p-7 @xcite , and hat - p-11 @xcite .",
    "these systems have been observed by _",
    "kepler _ in sc mode .",
    "their properties ( cf .",
    "table  [ tbl-0 ] ) indicate that they should display solar - like oscillations at observable amplitudes , and hence they are obvious targets for _ kepler _ asteroseismology .",
    "here we report the results of a preliminary asteroseismic characterization of the central stars in the systems , based on the early _ kepler _ data .",
    "we have analyzed data from _ kepler _ for three planet - hosting stars using a pipeline developed for fast and robust analysis of all _ kepler _ p - mode data @xcite .",
    "each time series contains 63324 data points .",
    "sc data characteristics and minor post - pipeline processing are discussed in @xcite .",
    "in addition a limb - darkened transit light curve model fit has been removed and 5-@xmath39 clipping applied to remove outlying data points from each of the time series .",
    "the frequency analysis contains four main steps :    1 .",
    "we calculate an oversampled ( factor of four ) version of the power spectrum by using a least - squares fitting .",
    "we smoothed the spectrum to @xmath40 resolution to remove the fine structure caused by the finite mode lifetime .",
    "we correlated the smoothed power spectrum with an equally spaced comb of delta functions , separated by @xmath41 , and confined to a gaussian - shaped band with a full width at half maximum of @xmath42 .",
    "we adopted the maximum of this convolution over lags between 0 and 0.5 @xmath6 as the filter output for each @xmath6 .",
    "3 .   after identifying the peak correlation for the best matched model filter and extracting the large separation corresponding to this peak",
    "we calculate the _ folded spectrum _ ( see fig .  [",

    "the summed power is used to locate the p - mode structure and identify the ridges corresponding to the different mode degrees ( based on the asymptotic relation ) .",
    "4 .   from the asymptotic relation and the identification of mode degrees we finally identify the position of the individual p - mode frequencies in the smoothed version of the power spectrum ;",
    "when more than one mode is seen near the expected frequency we use the power - weighted average of the two peaks .",
    "those extracted frequencies and the mode identifications are used in the modeling .    for observations with low signal - to - noise ratio it may not be possible to identify the individual frequencies . in such cases",
    "the analysis is carried through step 2 , to determine the maximum response and hence an estimate of the large separation .",
    "results on the three individual cases are presented in  [ sec : results ] .",

    "( see below ) diffusion and settling of helium were included , using the simplified formulation of @xcite .",
    "convection was treated with the @xcite mixing - length formulation , with a mixing length @xmath43 in units of the pressure scale height roughly corresponding to a solar calibration . in some models with convective cores ,",
    "overshoot was included over a distance of @xmath44 pressure scale heights .",
    "evolution started from chemically homogeneous zero - age models .",
    "the initial abundances by mass @xmath45 and @xmath46 of hydrogen and heavy elements were characterized by the assumed value of [ fe / h ] , using as reference a present solar surface composition with @xmath47 @xcite and assuming , from galactic chemical evolution , that @xmath48 .    from the observed @xmath6 , effective temperature and composition an initial estimate of the stellar parameters was obtained using the grid - based seek pipeline ( quirion et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "smaller grids were then computed in the vicinity of these initial parameters , to obtain tighter constraints on stellar properties . for hat - p-7",
    "the analysis of the observations yielded frequencies of individually identified modes ; here the analysis was based on @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the observed and model frequencies , @xmath52 is the standard error in the observed frequencies ( assumed to be constant ) and @xmath53 is the number of observed frequencies .",
    "in addition , we considered @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the corresponding normalized square difference between the observed and model effective temperature .",

    "* for details ) .",
    "when only the large separation @xmath6 could be determined from the observations , we identified the model along each track which matched @xmath6 and considered the resulting @xmath55 as a function of the model parameters .",

    "the outer convection zone is quite thin , and as a result the settling timescale is much shorter than the age of the star . including settling , without compensating effects such as partial mixing in the radiative region or mass loss , leads to a rapid change in the surface composition which is inconsistent with the observed [ fe / h ] ; for simplicity we therefore neglected these effects for hat - p-7 .",
    "the computed frequencies were corrected according to the procedure of @xcite for errors in the modeling of the near - surface layers , by adding @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . as discussed in  [ sec : model ] , for each evolution track , characterized by a set of model parameters , we minimized the departure @xmath56 of the model frequencies from the observations , defining the best model for this set .",
    "we first consider @xmath56 as a function of the effective temperature of the models ( fig .",

    "it is evident that there is a clear minimum in @xmath56 ; this is consistent with the determination of @xmath11 by @xcite but not with the somewhat higher temperature obtained by @xcite ( see also table  [ tbl-0 ] ) .",

    "[ fig : chisq]d @xmath57 is shown against model age . here",
    "the variation with model parameters is substantially stronger , resulting in a greater spread in the inferred age ; in particular , it is evident , not surprisingly , that the results depend on the extent of convective overshoot . from the figure we estimate that the age of hat - p-7 is between 1.4 and 2.3gyr .",
    "examples of evolution tracks are shown in fig .",

    "are the locations of the models minimizing @xmath56 along each of the computed tracks ; these evidently fall close to a line in the hr diagram , corresponding to the small range in @xmath7 .",
    "the range of luminosities , from @xcite , is based on modeling and hence has not been used in our fit ; even so , it is gratifying that the present models are essentially consistent with these values . also , as indicated by fig .",
    "[ fig : chisq]a and table  [ tbl-2 ] , the best - fitting models are close to the value of @xmath11 obtained by @xcite .",
    "the match of the best - fitting model ( model 3 of table  [ tbl-2 ] ) to the observed frequencies is illustrated in a so - called _ chelle diagram _",
    "@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : obs]c . in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq : asymp ] ) the frequency spectrum is divided into slices of length @xmath75 , starting at a frequency of @xmath76 ; the figure shows the location of the observed ( filled symbols ) and computed ( open symbols ) frequencies within each slice , against the starting frequency of the slice ; the model results extend to the acoustical cut - off frequency , @xmath77 , of the model .",
    "there is clearly a very good overall agreement between model and observations , including the detailed variation with frequency which reflects the frequency dependence of the large separation , as a possible diagnostics of the outer layers of the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have finally made a fit of the inferred @xmath7 , as well as @xmath11 and [ fe / h ] from @xcite , to computed evolutionary tracks from the yonsei - yale compilation @xcite . this was based on a markov chain monte carlo analysis to obtain the statistical properties of the inferred quantities ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "this resulted in @xmath78 , @xmath79 and an age of @xmath80gyr .",
    "we note that the age estimate reflects the specific assumptions in the yonsei - yale evolution calculations ; as indicated by fig .",
    "[ fig : chisq]d the true uncertainty in the age determination is likely somewhat larger .      for hat - p-11 the oscillation amplitudes were much smaller than in hat - p-7 , as expected from the general scaling of amplitudes with stellar mass and luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus with the present short run of data it has only been possible to determine the large separation @xmath81 from the maximum in the correlation analysis . we have matched this to a grid of models , including diffusion and settling of helium , with masses between 0.7 and @xmath82 and [ fe / h ] between 0.21 and 0.41 .",
    "these models provide a good fit to the observed @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; note that in the present case the luminosity is based on a reasonably well - determined parallax .",
    "we have determined an estimate of @xmath7 by averaging the results of those models which match the observed @xmath6 and lie within 2 standard deviations ( @xmath83k ) from the value of @xmath11 provided by @xcite ; the result is @xmath84 .",
    "although the formal error is extremely small , owing to a tight relation between the large separation and the mean density for stars in this region in the hr diagram , the true error is undoubtedly substantially larger . in particular",
    ", we neglected the error in the determination of @xmath6 and these data have not allowed a correction for the systematic errors in the modeling of the near - surface layers of the star .      here also we were unable to determine individual frequencies from the present set of data .",
    "the expected amplitudes are smaller than for hat - p-7 , and the noise level higher due to the fainter magnitude of tres-2 .",
    "the correlation analysis yielded two possible values of @xmath6 : @xmath85 and @xmath86 . for this star @xmath7",
    "has been determined from the analysis of the transit light curve . @xcite",
    "obtained @xmath87 , while @xcite found @xmath88 . from the scaling with",
    "@xmath89 the smaller of the two possible values of @xmath6 is clearly inconsistent with these values of @xmath7 , while @xmath90 yields models that are consistent with the observed @xmath11 and @xmath13 of @xcite as well as with these values of the mean density .",
    "here we considered a grid of models with helium diffusion and settling , masses between 0.85 and @xmath91 and [ fe / h ] between @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "determining again the mean value of @xmath7 for those models that matched @xmath6 and had @xmath11 within two standard deviations of the value of @xcite we obtained @xmath94 .",
    "as in the case of hat - p-11 the true error is likely substantially higher .",
    "the present preliminary analysis provides a striking demonstration of the potential of _ kepler _ asteroseismology and its supporting role in the analysis of planet hosts .",
    "these stars will undoubtedly be observed throughout the mission and hence the quality of the data will increase substantially . for hat - p-7",
    "the detected frequencies are already close to what will be required for a detailed analysis of the stellar interior , beyond the determination of the basic parameters of the star .",
    "thus here we can look forward to a test of the assumptions of the stellar modeling ; the resulting improvements will further constrain the overall properties of the star , in particular its age .",
    "also , given the observed @xmath14 we expect a rotational splitting comparable to that observed in the sun , and hence likely detectable with a few months of observations . for the other two stars there is strong evidence for the presence of solar - like oscillations ; thus continued observations will very likely result in the determination of individual frequencies and hence further constraints on the properties of the stars .",
    "funding for this discovery mission is provided by nasa s science mission directorate .",
