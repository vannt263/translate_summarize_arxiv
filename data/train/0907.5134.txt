    "the study of transport phenomena has attracted considerable interest over the years due to its relevance in many physical situations .",
    "the latter are often described on the basis of one - dimensional particle motion in a tilted spatially periodic potential @xcite-@xcite .",
    "corresponding experimental realisations include josephson junctions @xcite , charge density waves @xcite , superionic conductors @xcite , rotation of dipoles in external fields @xcite , phase - locked loops @xcite and diffusion of dimers on surfaces @xcite to name but a few . in many of these aforementioned situations the particles , in addition to their motion in the periodic potential ,",

    "the objective of the current work is to investigate the conditions under which it is possible to generate a directed flow along with collective motion in a system of coupled particles . to be precise ,",
    "we study the transport of a dimer evolving in a washboard potential experiencing a weak tilt force . the nonlinear bond dynamics between the two monomers , constituting the dimer , is modelled by a morse potential allowing for bond breaking , i.e. fragmentation .",
    "we focus our interest on the chaos - promoted detrapping mechanism for dimers that initially reside in one well of the washboard potential .",
    "provided that such a detrapping transition happens the question then is under which circumstances subsequent directed long - range particle transport is achievable .",
    "since the total system energy is too low for both monomers to be able to escape from the potential well simultaneously , we explore whether cooperative energy redistribution is possible allowing at least one of the monomers to escape and subsequently display directed motion .",
    "we also elucidate the possible scenario in which the energy exchange between the monomers proceeds in such a well - coordinated manner that the monomers move separately from one well into the next , one following the other , resulting in directed motion of the dimer .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the next section the model of the dimer system is introduced , followed by the formulation of the escape problem together with a brief discussion of the related phase space structure . in section [",
    "section : current ] the particle current is studied and the occurrence of different transport scenarios is described . afterwards in section [ section : space ] we relate the phase space dynamics to the regime of high particle current . in particular chaotic invariant sets ,",
    "their connection with singularities of the escape time function , and their relevance for the escape process are considered . in section [ section : potential ]",
    "we present an alternative description of the escape problem as the motion of a single particle in a two - dimensional potential landscape .",
    "finally we summarise and discuss our results .",

    "@xmath25 $ ] , is then too large by far to treat the coupling using a perturbational approach .",
    "we therefore resort to a numerical analysis of the coupled monomer dynamics .",
    "let us briefly discuss the phase space structure corresponding to the dynamics in the tilted washboard potential",
    ". in the range @xmath26 the tilt force , @xmath27 , is effectively of strength @xmath12 .",

    "the initial positions of the monomers are taken as @xmath35 , so that the dimer is contained in one of the wells of the washboard potential and , for the weak tilt strength @xmath7 used throughout the paper , is initially situated in virtually the lowest energy dimer configuration compatible with the bond length @xmath18 .",

    "directed motion of the dimer to occur at all , cooperation between the monomers , in the form of appropriately coordinated energy exchanges , is required .",
    "particle transport is assessed quantitatively by the mean momentum , viz .",
    "the _ current _ , which is defined as the time average of the ensemble averaged momentum , i.e. @xmath40 with simulation time @xmath41 and with the ensemble average given by @xmath42 here @xmath43 denotes the number of particles constituting the ensemble . for the computation of the ensemble average",

    "@xmath52 the current exhibits variations and even vanishes for @xmath53 .",
    "interestingly the current effectively grows for @xmath54 .",
    "finally the current rises rapidly and monotonically in the range @xmath55 and effectively saturates at a high level for @xmath56 .     for parameter values @xmath7 and @xmath8 . ]",
    "we emphasise that the amplitude of the tilt force @xmath7 is too small to alter the washboard potential significantly compared to the case without tilt .",
    "in fact the influence of the tilt force is sufficiently small that , for example , the potential barrier immediately to the right of the initial well is lowered by a mere @xmath57 and hence the induced bias is very weak .    in the following",
    "we illustrate the complex solution behaviour of system ( [ eq : q1]),([eq : q2 ] ) and the implications for the contribution to the net current .",
    "[ fig : time ] shows the temporal evolution of the coordinates @xmath58 and @xmath59 for four different values of @xmath16 but for the same initial condition leading to various types of solutions .     in dimensionless units .",
    "the remaining parameter values are given by : @xmath23 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . ]    for the low value @xmath60 the coordinates perform small - amplitude oscillations around their respective starting value ( see the upper left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : time ] ) .",
    "thus the monomers remain trapped in the potential well and the contribution to the net current is zero .",
    "in contrast for @xmath61 we observe that after a finite period of chaotic but bounded dimer motion the bond between them breaks . as a result the right monomer ( with index @xmath62 ) is released and due to the ( still acting ) tilt force accelerated into the region of higher momenta while its left counterpart ( with index @xmath63 ) becomes again trapped in a potential well .",
    "the subsequent regular dynamics is characterised by different motions of the monomers , namely that of the right monomer moving rightwards ( rotations ) in the asymptotic region and the left monomer performing bounded oscillations in a potential well ( librations ) . in this case , the directed motion of the right monomer gives a contribution to the net current .",
    "we stress that , after such fragmentation , reformation of a bound state dimer from the two isolated monomers is excluded .",

    "nevertheless the net motion proceeds to the right .",
    "notice that the bond remains unbroken , and hence the dimer intact , in this case .",
    "interestingly for a high value @xmath66 the dimer manages quickly to escape from the potential well .",
    "( we remark that for some other initial conditions we observed first a longer transient of still bounded but chaotic motion before the escape eventually took place . )",
    "furthermore , as the inset reveals , the two monomers perform out - of - phase motion , viz .",
    "the length of the bond between them alternately ( slightly ) decreases and increases .",
    "this is associated with such well - coordinated energy exchanges between the monomers that firstly the right - hand monomer overcomes the potential barrier and reaches the adjacent well on the right , subsequently the left monomer follows , and so on .",
    "we underline that prior to its arrival in the asymptotic region the trajectory passes through a chaotic transient to adopt regular dynamics in the asymptotic region .",
    "it is the asymptotic vanishing of the tilt force that makes transient chaos possible .",
    "clearly the directed dimer motion contributes with significant weight to the net current . in particular , the dimer moves with higher velocity for @xmath66 than the escaped monomer does for @xmath61 .    to summarise briefly : we distinguish between four qualitatively different transport scenarios : + ( i ) the dimer remains trapped inside the starting potential well and hence , there results no contribution to the net current .",
    "+ ( ii ) the dimer escapes from the starting potential and undergoes subsequently diffusive motion with no substantial contribution to the net current .",
    "+ ( iii ) directed energy transfer from the left monomer to the right one leads not only to fragmentation but also to such a high energy gain of the right monomer that it can undergo directed motion to the right . this _",
    "individual _ directed motion yields a considerable contribution to the net current .",
    "+ ( iv ) appropriately coordinated energy redistribution between the monomers leads to directed _ collective _ motion such that first the right monomer performs a transition from one potential well into the next one to the right and afterwards the left monomer follows .",
    "notice that this corresponds to repeated detrapping - trapping transitions .",
    "this scenario is optimal in the sense that it enables both monomers to perform consecutive step - wise escapes from the potential wells . since the total amount of energy does not suffice for a simultaneous escape of both monomers they must necessarily share their energy cooperatively in order to achieve escape at all .",
    "this almost - periodic energy exchange between the monomers corresponds in phase space to motion near a stable period - one fixed point ( see further in [ section : potential ] ) .",
    "notably the directed chaotic motion persists even in the asymptotic region where there is no bias anymore .",
    "furthermore , the resulting velocity is higher than in case ( iii ) and so is the contribution to the net current .",
    "we mention that , apart from the ideal situation of ongoing directed motion , for other initial conditions the dimer performs directed long - distance motion in a restricted time interval at the end of which non - directed diffusive motion as in case ( ii ) follows .",
    "we emphasise that the scenarios shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] are not necessarily representative of the dynamics of all initial conditions at the respective values of the coupling strength @xmath16 ; at @xmath66 , for example , scenarios ( iii ) and ( iv ) both occur ( for different initial conditions ) . concerning the current we therefore remark that , at each fixed value of the coupling strength @xmath16 , each of the transport scenarios ( i)-(iv ) will , if present , contribute with different weight to the ensemble average for the current , which results in the complex behaviour seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] .",
    "in order to discuss the corresponding dynamics taking place on the three - dimensional energy hypersurface in the four - dimensional phase space we introduce the following poincar surface of section ( pss ) @xmath67 in fig.@xmath68(a ) and ( c ) we depict the pss for @xmath60 and @xmath66 , respectively using an ensemble of @xmath69 initial conditions fulfilling the relation ( [ eq : ring ] ) with @xmath38 .",

    "there are trajectories that remain in the starting region or spend at least some time there before escape as a consequence of the presence of chaotic saddles @xcite,@xcite .",

    "[ fig : ballistic](c ) , islands of regular motion arise from those trajectories that have settled on regular dynamics after their passage through a chaotic transient .",
    "most importantly , these islands possess non - zero winding numbers and thus act as ballistic channels @xcite providing directed transport to the right . in particular , the dynamics within the island structure centered at the stable period - one fixed point @xmath114 reflects the almost - synchronous monomer motion described in scenario ( iv ) in section [ section : current ] . in more detail , motion near the fixed point corresponds to almost - periodic energy exchange between the monomers which is connected with only minor bond deformations which corroborates the findings reported above for the optimal transport scenario .",
    "we have analysed the hamiltonian dynamics of two nonlinearly coupled particles evolving in a washboard potential .",
    "notably the total energy does not suffice to enable simultaneous escape of the two particles , initially trapped in a well of the washboard potential .",
    "due to appropriate energy redistribution , at least one of the particles can achieve escape .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "ideally the two particles share energy almost periodically in such a way that consecutive detrapping - trapping transitions take place during which the particles escape one after another from one well into an adjacent one .",
    "it has been demonstrated that a weak tilt force , vanishing asymptotically in the direction of the bias , is sufficient to instigate directed motion of the escaping particles .",
    "transport is accomplished for those trajectories which follow a chaotic transient , associated with the dynamics of chaotic saddles , settling afterwards on regular motion .",
    "the key mechanism of current rectification is based on the asymptotically vanishing tilt causing a symmetry breaking of the non - chaotic fraction of the dynamics where only at the upper boundary of the chaotic layer resonance islands appear .",
    "the latter is supported by transporting island structures in the mixed phase space which serve for long - range directed transport .",
    "finally , we mention that it is certainly interesting to extend the study of directed motion to systems involving many more degrees of freedom than in the current dimer case where the dynamics within transporting islands can be investigated utilising two - dimensional poincar surface of sections . in particular , it needs to be examined what structures in higher dimensional phase spaces play the role of possible ballistic channels providing directed collective transport .",
