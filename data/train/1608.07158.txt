    "implied volatility is one of the most important observed data in financial markets : it represents the price of european options and reflects market participants views . over the past two decades , a number of ( stochastic ) models have been proposed in order to understand its dynamics and reproduce its features . in recent years , a lot of research has been devoted to understanding the asymptotic behaviour ( large strikes  @xcite , small / large maturities  @xcite ) of the implied volatility in a large class of models in extreme cases ; these results not only provide closed - form expressions ( usually unavailable ) for the implied volatility , but also shed light on the role of each model parameter and , ultimately on the efficiency of each model .",
    "continuous stochastic volatility models driven by brownian motion effectively fit the volatility smile ( at least for indices ) ; the widely used heston model , for example , is able to fit the volatility surface for almost all maturities  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) , but becomes inaccurate for small maturities .",
    "the fundamental reason is that small - maturity data is much steeper ( for small strikes)the so - called ` short - time explosion'than the smile generated by these stochastic volatility models ( a detailed account of this phenomenon can be found in the volatility bible  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters 3 and 5 ) )",
    ". to palliate this issue , gatheral ( among others ) comments that jumps should be added in the stock dynamics ; the literature on the influence of the jumps is vast , and we only mention here the clear review by tankov  @xcite in the case of exponential lvy models , where the short - time implied volatility explodes at a rate of  @xmath2 for small  @xmath3 . to observe non - trivial convergence ( or divergence ) ,",
    "mijatovi and tankov  @xcite introduced maturity - dependent strikes , and studied the behaviour of the smile in this regime .    as an alternative to jumps ,",
    "a portion of the mathematical finance community has recently been advocating the use of fractional brownian motion ( with hurst parameter  @xmath4 smaller than  @xmath5 ) as driver of the volatility process .",
    "gatheral , jaisson and rosenbaum  @xcite showed that such a model is indeed capable of generating steep volatility smiles for small maturities .",
    "guennoun , jacquier and roome  @xcite investigated a fractional version of the heston model , and proved that as  @xmath3 tends to zero the squared implied volatility explodes at a rate  @xmath6 .",
    "forde and zhang  @xcite proved similar results when the volatility is a hlder continuous function of the fractional brownian motion .",
    "this is not however the end of the story  yet  as computational costs for simulation , decent for standard stochastic volatility models , become a severe concern in fractional models .",
    "we propose here a new class of models , namely standard stochastic volatility models ( driven by standard brownian motion ) where the initial value of the variance is randomised , and focus our attention to the heston version .",
    "the motivation for this approach originates from the analysis of forward - start smiles by jacquier and roome  @xcite , who proved that the forward implied volatility explodes at a rate of  @xmath7 as  @xmath3 tends to zero .",
    "a simple version of our current study is the ` cev - randomised black - scholes model ' introduced in  @xcite , where the black - scholes volatility is randomised according to the distribution generated from an independent cev process ; in this work , the authors proved that this simplified model generates the desired explosion of the smile .",
    "we push this analysis further here ; our intuition behind this new type of models is that the starting point of the volatility process is actually not observed accurately , but only to some degree of uncertainty .",
    "traders , for example , might take it as the smallest ( maturity - wise ) observed at - the - money implied volatility .",
    "our initial randomisation aims at capturing this uncertainty .",
    "this approach was recently taken by mechkov  @xcite , considering the ergodic distribution of the cir process as starting distribution , who argues that randomising the starting point captures potential hidden variables .",
    "one could also potentially look at this from the point of view of uncertain models , and we refer the reader to  @xcite for an interesting related study .",
    "the main result of our paper is to provide a precise link between the explosion rate of the implied volatility smile for short maturities and the choice of the ( right tail of the ) initial distribution of the variance process .",
    "the following table ( a more complete version with more examples can be found in table  [ table : nonlin ] ) gives an idea of the range of explosion rates that can be achieved through our procedure ; for each suggested distribution of the initial variance , we indicate the asymptotic behaviour ( up to a constant multiplier ) of the ( square of the ) out - of - the - money implied volatility smile ( in the first row , the function  @xmath8 will be determined precisely later , but the absence of time - dependence is synonymous with absence of explosion ) .

    "we apply fast fourier transform ( fft ) methods  @xcite to derive a matrix of option prices , and then compute the corresponding implied volatilities using a root - finding algorithm .",
