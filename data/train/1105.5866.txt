    "several nearby galaxy clusters contain extended non - thermal radio lobes that appear to be unrelated to currently visible x - ray cavities .",
    "for example , the iconic image of the virgo cluster at 90 cm ( 325 mhz ) from owen , eilek & kassim ( 2000 ) , shown in figure 1 , features two large opposing quasi - circular radio lobes .",
    "( the famous 2 kpc radio jet in m87 is over - exposed in the central dark region . ) in mathews & brighenti ( 2008a ) we proposed that the virgo radio lobes were formed by relativistic electrons that diffused through the walls of x - ray cavities that have long - since buoyantly risen and disappeared from view .",
    "this conjecture seemed attractive because a 25-kpc long radial thermal x - ray filament ( young , wilson & mundell 2002 ; forman , et al .",
    "2005 ; werner , n. et al . 2010 ; million et al .",
    "2010 ) passes in projection right through the center of the southern virgo lobe , suggesting that both were formed in the same x - ray cavity event .",
    "moreover , the radio - synchrotron spectral age of the oldest and most distant electrons in the virgo lobes , @xmath0 yrs , matches the dynamical age of the post - cavity filament as computed by mathews & brighenti ( 2008a ) who suggested that the radio - synchrotron electrons currently filling the southern lobe may have diffused through the walls of the same filament - forming x - ray cavity .",
    "cosmic ray electrons freely diffusing isotropically from the center of the southern lobe of radius @xmath1 kpc suggests a diffusion coefficient @xmath2 @xmath3 s@xmath4 .",
    "but a potential difficulty with a simultaneous origin for the thermal x - ray filament and southern virgo lobe is the absence of a corresponding radial thermal filament in the northern lobe .",
    "in addition , we now suspect that the virgo radio lobes have a more complex evolution resulting from a multitude of active galactic nucleus ( agn ) outbursts that continuously resupply cosmic ray electrons to the lobes , a point of view also suggested by owen , eilek & kassim .",
    "the 8-shaped virgo lobes may represent an approximately bipolar energy ejection pattern from the central black hole in m87 .",
    "agn jet and cavity activity in virgo ( as in perseus and many other clusters ) rarely occurs along a fixed bipolar axis as defined for example by an unchanging black hole spin , but jet energy may be distributed in directions near such an axis . as a consequence",
    ", the virgo lobes may expand much slower and be older than implied by free cosmic ray diffusion .    with this in mind , we draw attention in figure 1 to the sharp transition at the outer boundary of the virgo radio lobes where the radio flux abruptly decreases , completely unlike the smooth gaussian transition expected for free diffusion with @xmath5 @xmath3 s@xmath4 .",
    "owen , eilek and kassim ( 2000 ) emphasize that the sudden decrease in radio flux at the lobe boundary is real , not an artifact of image - processing software .",
    "another curious widespread feature just at this lobe - cluster gas transition are the bright synchrotron - emitting rims visible in figure 1 immediately adjacent to the sudden sharp drop to zero radio flux . according to owen , eilek and kassim , this counterintuitive",
    "radio limb - brightening is present in over half of the perimeter of both lobes .    in the following discussion",
    "we propose that the bright radio rims can be understood if the diffusion coefficient of synchrotron - emitting electrons decreases sharply near the lobe - cluster gas boundaries .",
    "we assume that cosmic rays ( relativistic electrons and/or protons ) in the radio lobes are coupled to the gas by means of a magnetic field frozen into the gas through which cosmic rays may diffuse .",
    "while the magnetic field allows cosmic ray pressure gradients to act on the cluster gas , the small magnetic energy density is dynamically negligible .",
    "magnetic fields of strength 0.3 - 10 @xmath6 g are ubiquitous in cluster gas ( govoni & feretti 2004 ) . in general the magnetic field decreases with cluster radius and decreasing gas density .",
    "an approximate powerlaw relation @xmath7 with @xmath8 in the coma cluster gas has been established from faraday depolarization observations of cluster galaxies ( bonafede et al .",
    "however , fields with energy densities @xmath9 erg @xmath10 can not significantly influence the dynamics of local cluster gas with a much larger thermal energy density @xmath11 erg @xmath10 , and @xmath12 probably holds at every radius in the cluster gas . in view of this , magnetic fields need not explicitly appear in the dynamical equations : @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the energy density - pressure relations for gas and cosmic rays respectively and @xmath19 is the difussivity of cosmic rays .",
    "weak magnetic fields evolve passively , advecting with the gas .",
    "these equations are discussed further in mathews & brighenti ( 2008a , b ) .    recognizing the relatively short time for gas to flow past the radio lobe boundary",
    ", we do not consider the energy lost by thermal or non - thermal radiation as gas flows through the boundary rims .",
    "the time required for gas flowing at velocity @xmath20 km s@xmath4 to cross the bright ratio rims of thickness @xmath21 kpc is @xmath22 yrs .",
    "however , the radiative cooling time in the ambient gas near the radio lobes ( @xmath23 g @xmath10 , @xmath24k ) is much longer , @xmath25 yrs , where @xmath26 is the usual coefficient for optically thin thermal emission .",
    "furthermore , the calculation we consider is embedded in the gravitationally supported hot gas atmosphere in a galaxy cluster where local cooling after the loss of energy by radiative emission does not occur .",
    "any decrease in the local gas temperature due to radiative losses is rapidly reversed by a global compression and gas inflow that maintains the virial temperature and pressure required to support the entire atmosphere . moreover , no thermal jump associated with the virgo radio lobe boundaries has been observed in detailed x - ray observations ( million et al .",
    "non - thermal electrons of energy @xmath27 radiating in a @xmath28 g field produce synchrotron emission at @xmath29 cm as in figure 1 . the synchrotron lifetime for these electrons",
    ", @xmath30 yrs , also exceeds @xmath31 .",
    "however , the local synchrotron lifetime is not particularly relevant for our diffusion front calculation where new cosmic ray electrons are continuously provided by diffusion from the adjacent radio lobe .",
    "but we do assume that the synchrotron radio spectral index @xmath32 , appropriate for a power law distribution of electron energies , remains constant across the diffusion front .",

    "notice that as @xmath35 approaches zero at some finite @xmath78 at the leading edge of the diffusion front , the gas velocity is asymptotically finite and negative as cluster gas enters the front ; the second term in equation ( 14 ) also vanishes at @xmath79 , indicating that diffusion at the leading edge of the front is balanced by advection downstream .",

    "( 1996 ) shown in figure 3 reveal a remarkably high degree of linear polarization ( @xmath96% ) , particularly near the outer edges of the lobes where the field direction is highly ordered .",
    "field vectors plotted in figure 3 indicate that the direction of the magnetic field is tangent to the boundary of both lobes over most of the lobe perimeter .",
    "this is consistent with the relative compression in figure 2 near the lobe - cluster gas boundary at @xmath78 . in our calculation",
    "the magnetic field evolves passively with the gas but does not have sufficient energy density to influence the flow parameters . in a one - dimensional flow with approximately perpendicular field alignment",

    "since @xmath75 is always negative , the quantity in brackets must also be negative .",

    "in addition , the magnetic field perpendicular to the flow continues to be uniform in the cluster gas beyond the radio lobe ; bright radio rims occur as the diffusing electrons encounter this inflowing field .",
    "evidently the tangential @xmath158 field just ahead of the front is prepared in a compression between a subsonically outwardly expanding lobe and/or radiatively cooling cluster gas inflowing toward the lobe .",
    "the pressure of relativistic electrons responsible for the radio emission observed in virgo is unlikely to be the only or even the dominant non - thermal pressure component .",
    "the electron energy distribution @xmath159 peaks toward lower energies that emit at radio wavelengths too large to be currently detected . in studies of radio synchrotron and inverse compton x - ray emission from electrons of the same energy inside x - ray cavities , assumed to be in pressure balance with local cluster gas , croston et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find no evidence for an energetically dominant relativistic proton population .",
    "although relativistic protons dominate the cosmic ray energy density in the milky way , they are difficult to detect in extragalactic sources .",
    "observational efforts should be made to detect the total non - thermal pressure in the virgo radio lobes by identifying a lower gas pressure in the lobe compared to that in cluster gas outside the lobes at the same distance from the cluster center .",
    "small irregularities in the azimuthally - averaged radial x - ray surface brightness profile in virgo have been discussed in detail ( churazov et al .",
    "2008 ) , but a similar effort should be made to detect azimuthal variations in the x - ray surface brightness and gas pressure that correlate with the radio lobe structures . since the radio lobe boundaries are well - defined , it should be possible to detect or set rather tight limits on the contribution of non - thermal components to the pressure in the lobe .    to explore this possibility",
    ", we constructed an approximate azimuthally - averaged radial ( bolometric ) x - ray surface brightness profile in virgo ( using the ghizzardi et al .",
    "2004 observations ) and estimated the brightness reduction produced by depleting the gas density by two inside symmetric radio lobes of radius 23 kpc with centers 13.7 kpc from the cluster center in m87 , assumed to be in the plane of the sky .",
    "we found that the x - ray surface brightness in mid - lobe regions is depleted by about 0.55 - 0.70 along m87-centered circles of radius 25 - 30 kpc , circles that also contain large regions of cluster gas outside the lobes that can be used for calibration .",
    "near the lobe rims the x - ray surface brightness profile is likely to have a slope change , not a sharp discontinuity . the gas temperature may also differ across the lobe boundary since thermal conductivity will also be reduced by magnetic fields tangent to the boundary .    however , no lowering of the gas pressure in the radio lobes is apparent in the recent virgo pressure image of million et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , although low amplitude thermal pressure variations may eventually be detected with dedicated x - ray observations .",
    "if the contribution of cosmic rays to the total pressure is lower than we assume here , @xmath160 , the condition ( 24 ) for radio limb brightening requires a larger value of the spectral index @xmath32 .",
    "for example , if @xmath161 contributes only about 13% of the total pressure in the lobes , we require @xmath162 for limb - brightening , but the structure of the diffusion front remains similar to those in figures 2 , 4 and 5 .",
    "the terminology for feedback - related diffuse radio emitting regions in galaxy clusters includes mini - halos , lobes and emission from x - ray cavities .",
    "we stress here that all of these extended radio - emitting regions must to some extent also be x - ray cavities , although may not have been detected with current x - ray observations particularly if @xmath163 .",
    "another complication that can arise in detecting x - ray cavities is the possibility of inverse compton x - ray emission from upscattered cosmic microwave radiation , as recently observed in the large radio lobes in the fornax cluster ( tahiro et al .",
    "2009 ; seta et al .",
    "additional inverse compton x - radiation that accompanies the radio emission would make detection of thermal cavities in the hot cluster gas more difficult .",
    "our simple calculation shows that cosmic rays in the virgo cluster can be strongly confined within certain regions of the cluster gas .",
    "confinement is aided by magnetic fields that are tangent to the boundaries of these regions where the synchrotron emission decreases with decreasing cosmic ray diffusivity .",
    "broad gaussian - shaped diffusion fronts associated with free diffusion at constant diffusivity @xmath19 in the cluster gas are not present in virgo and can not be generally assumed .",
    "nevertheless , free diffusion of synchrotron emitting electrons may occur in nature and can be detected by spectral _ flattening _ near the outer edges of gaussian - broadened radio lobes because the diffusion coefficient increases for more energetic relativistic electrons .",
    "the radio lobes in virgo , and those in other clusters , are naturally buoyant because the additional partial pressure of cosmic rays depresses the thermal gas pressure ( and gas density ) in the lobe to match the cluster gas pressure just outside the lobe . as these large buoyant lobes attempt to slowly rise in the cluster atmosphere",
    ", they encounter cluster gas that is slowly inflowing due to radiation losses , compressing gas throughout the lobes and at the lobe - cluster gas boundaries . this compression forces the cluster magnetic field to become nearly perpendicular to the direction of compression , and tangent to the diffusion front interface , sharply limiting cosmic ray diffusion in this direction . in this sense",
    "the propagation of cosmic rays in cluster gas is self - limiting .",
    "except for the idealized singular case where the magnetic field is aligned precisely perpendicular to the diffusion front , as the expanding radio lobe and inflowing cluster gas mutually compress at glacial velocities , the magnetic field is forced to become tangent to the lobe boundary , becoming locally perpendicular to the compression regardless of its initial morphology . evidently , a similar field - orienting compression occurs throughout the virgo radio lobes , as supported by the polarization vectors in figure 3",
    ". such an alignment can not simply be due to so - called `` draping '' of magnetic lines of force along its boundary since it is most unlikely that large scale magnetic field lines exist that connect across the lobe boundaries and throughout the interior of the lobes . considering the dynamic activity inside the lobes visible in figure 1 , the spatial continuity of polarization vectors in figure 3 from one observed beam position to the next along the field direction",
    "almost certainly does not trace a single magnetic line of force .",
    "instead , we envision a field that naturally aligns perpendicular to a large scale one - dimensional compression much like spaghetti arranges itself horizontally when served on a dinner plate .",
    "magnetic fields _ of all spatial scales _ are aligned in this manner , accounting for the remarkable consistency of the direction and magnitude of the polarization vectors observed in virgo .",
    "the insensitivity of compressive field alignment to the spatial scale or local curvature of the field is particularly relevant to galaxy clusters like virgo where the relativistic electron gyroradius @xmath164 cm is @xmath165 times smaller than the radius of the lobes .",
    "the polarizing magnetic field experienced by synchrotron - radiating electrons , when averaged over kpc - sized radio beams as in figure 3 , gives the impression of magnetic field lines that are coherent over kpc - scales , i.e. that single field lines are `` draped '' .",
    "however , the field seen by the radiating electrons is likely to have a range of different scales ( radius of curvature ) but the electrons responsible for the observed polarized emission radiate from field segments that are locally aligned perpendicular to both the line of sight and to the large scale compression the radiating segments do not need to be ( and are probably not ) connected along a single large scale line of force .",
    "the region of compressionally aligned @xmath158 in our diffusion fronts could extend significantly beyond the lobe boundary where @xmath166 in figure 1 . a similar cosmic ray confinement by boundary - tangent @xmath167 is also expected in x - ray cavities with corresponding radio continuum limb - brightening and high polarization near the radio emission boundaries at the cavity walls .",
    "detailed radio observations of magnetic field polarization and alignment along the walls of known x - ray cavities do not appear to have been attempted .",
    "our steady state solutions describe the upstream diffusion of relativistic cosmic rays from a radio lobe slowly compressing against cluster gas where the cosmic ray energy density is negligible .",
    "as indicated by radio polarization observations of virgo , the magnetic field in the upstream cluster gas is aligned largely tangent to the lobe boundary and perpendicular to the gas flow . at the leading edge of the advancing cosmic ray diffusion front , where non - thermal particles first penetrate into the undisturbed cluster gas , the diffusion coefficient declines sharply with increasing magnetic field strength and its unfavorable alignment .",
    "nevertheless , the small non - thermal pressure introduced by diffusing cosmic rays near the leading edge of the front lowers the local gas pressure and the reduced gas density @xmath168 drives a gas flow that expands back toward the radio lobe in a direction opposite to the forward advancing diffusion . under certain conditions",
    "bright radio synchrotron rims are expected along the diffusion front at the lobe boundary as shown in figure 1 . as the steady diffusion front",
    "is approached from the radio lobe side , the synchrotron emissivity rises because of the increasing magnetic field ( @xmath97 ) but ultimately declines with the decreasing number density of synchrotron - emitting electrons .",
    "the sharpness of the radio synchrotron emission peaks and its decline to zero flux depends on the rate that the diffusion coefficient decreases across the diffusion front .",
    "bright radio synchrotron rims are expected when the partial pressure of cosmic rays inside the radio lobe and the spectral index are sufficiently large .",
    "our analysis in this paper describes lobe rim profiles that are in qualitative agreement with the radio image of virgo .",
    "as more data become available at several radio frequencies , a precise fit to the radio limb brightening at the lobe boundaries in virgo may allow for the first time an estimate of the spatial profiles of the field strength @xmath147 and the corresponding cosmic ray diffusion coefficient @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , it may be possible to determine from x - ray observations whether the total non - thermal pressure in the virgo lobes can be estimated from azimuthal gas density and pressure variations across the lobes along cluster - centered circular arcs that intersect both the radio lobes and cluster gas outside the lobes .",
    "indirect detection or non - detection of the pressure of additional unobserved thermal or relativistic particles in radio lobes would have broad astrophysical implications .",
    "finally , we note that the presence of a gas density jump at the lobe - cluster gas transition in virgo as in figure 5 may help to divert and divide the outflowing gas at the top of the eastern mushroom - like flow visible in figure 1 .",
