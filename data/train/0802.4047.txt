    "a network of ground - based interferometric gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors ( ligo / virgo / geo/@xmath0 ) is currently taking data near its planned sensitivity . coalescing black hole binaries",
    "are among the most promising , and most exciting , gw sources for these detectors . in order to successfully detect gws from coalescing black hole binaries , and to be able to reliably measure the physical parameters of the source ( masses , spins , @xmath0 ) ,",
    "it is necessary to know in advance the shape of the gw signals emitted by inspiralling and merging black holes .",
    "indeed , the detection and subsequent data analysis of gw signals is made by using a large bank of _ templates _ that accurately represent the gw waveforms emitted by the source .",
    "here , we shall introduce the reader to one promising strategy toward having an accurate analytical numerical relativity simulations , numerically solving ode s is extremely fast , and can therefore be done ( possibly even in real time ) for a dense sampling of theoretical parameters , such as orbital ( @xmath1 ) or spin ( @xmath2 ) parameters . ]",
    "description of the motion and radiation of binary black holes , which covers all its stages ( inspiral , plunge , merger and ring - down ) : the _ effective one body _",
    "approach @xcite .",
    "as early as 2000 @xcite this method made several quantitative and qualitative predictions concerning the dynamics of the coalescence , and the corresponding gw radiation , notably : ( i ) a blurred transition from inspiral to a ` plunge ' that is just a smooth continuation of the inspiral , ( ii ) a sharp transition , around the merger of the black holes , between a continued inspiral and a ring - down signal , and ( iii ) estimates of the radiated energy and of the spin of the final black hole .",
    "in addition , the effects of the individual spins of the black holes were investigated within the eob @xcite and were shown to lead to a larger energy release for spins parallel to the orbital angular momentum , and to a dimensionless rotation parameter @xmath3 always smaller than unity at the end of the inspiral ( so that a kerr black hole can form right after the inspiral phase ) .",
    "all those predictions have been broadly confirmed by the results of the recent numerical simulations performed by several independent groups @xcite ( for a review of numerical relativity results see @xcite ) .",
    "note that , in spite of the high computer power used in these simulations , the calculation of one sufficiently long waveform ( corresponding to specific values of the many continuous parameters describing the two arbitrary masses , the initial spin vectors , and other initial data ) takes on the order of two weeks .",
    "this is a very strong argument for developing analytical models of waveforms .",
    "those recent breakthroughs in numerical relativity ( nr ) open the possibility of comparing in detail the eob description to nr results .",
    "this eob / nr comparison has been recently initiated in several works @xcite .",
    "the level of analytical / numerical agreement is unprecedented , compared to what has been previously achieved when comparing other types of analytical waveforms to numerical ones .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that the maximal dephasing between a recent , very accurate nr simulation of 30 gw cycles during late inspiral @xcite and eob could be reduced below @xmath4 gw cycles .",
    "the same comparison exhibited also an excellent agreement between the amplitudes of the nr and eob waveforms . if the reader wishes to put the eob results in contrast with other ( post - newtonian or hybrid ) approaches he can consult , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .    before reviewing some of the technical aspects of the eob method ,",
    "let us indicate some of the historical roots of this method .",
    "first , we note that the eob approach comprises three , rather separate , ingredients :    * a description of the conservative ( hamiltonian ) part of the dynamics of two black holes ; * an expression for the radiation - reaction part of the dynamics ; * a description of the gw waveform emitted by a coalescing binary system .",
    "for each one of these ingredients , the essential inputs that are used in eob developments are high - order post - newtonian ( pn ) expanded results which have been obtained by many years of work , by many researchers ( see references below ) .",
    "however , one of the key ideas in the eob philosophy is to avoid using pn results in their original ` taylor - expanded ' form ( _ i.e. _ @xmath5 , but to use them instead in some _ resummed _ form ( _ i.e. _ some non - polynomial function of @xmath6 , defined so as to incorporate some of the expected non - perturbative features of the exact result ) .",
    "the basic ideas and techniques for resumming each ingredient of the eob are different and have different historical roots . concerning the ingredient ( 1 ) , _ i.e. _ the eob hamiltonian , it was inspired by an approach to electromagnetically interacting quantum two - body systems introduced by brzin , itzykson and zinn - justin @xcite .",
    "the resummation of the ingredient ( 2 ) , _ i.e. _ the eob radiation - reaction force @xmath7 , was inspired by the pad resummation of the flux function introduced by damour , iyer and sathyaprakash @xcite .",
    "as for the ingredient ( 3 ) , _ i.e. _ the eob description of the waveform emitted by a coalescing black hole binary , it was mainly inspired by the work of davis , ruffini and tiomno @xcite which discovered the transition between the plunge signal and a ringing tail when a particle falls into a black hole .",
    "additional motivation for the eob treatment of the transition from plunge to ring - down came from work on the , so - called , ` close limit approximation ' @xcite .",
    "let us finally note that the eob approach has been recently improved by following a methodology consisting of studying , element by element , the physics behind each feature of the waveform , and on systematically comparing various eob - based waveforms with ` exact ' waveforms obtained by nr approaches . among these ` exact ' nr waveforms , it has been useful to consider the small - mass - ratio limit @xmath8 , in which one can use the well controllable ` laboratory ' of numerical simulations of test particles ( with an added radiation - reaction force ) moving in black hole backgrounds @xcite .",
    "before discussing the various resummation techniques used in the eob approach , let us briefly recall the ` taylor - expanded ' results that have been obtained by pushing to high accuracies the post - newtonian ( pn ) methods .",
    "concerning the orbital dynamics of compact binaries , we recall that the 2.5pn - accurate - pn accuracy ' means that a result has been derived up to ( and including ) terms which are @xmath9 fractionally smaller than the leading contribution . ]",
    "equations of motion have been derived in the 1980 s @xcite . pushing the accuracy of the equations of motion to the 3pn ( @xmath10 ) level proved to be a non - trivial task . at first , the representation of black holes by delta - function sources and the use of the ( non diffeomorphism invariant ) hadamard regularization method led to ambiguities in the computation of the badly divergent integrals that enter the 3pn equations of motion @xcite .",
    "this problem was solved by using the ( diffeomorphism invariant ) _ dimensional regularization _ method ( _ i.e. _ analytic continuation in the dimension of space @xmath11 ) which allowed one to complete the determination of the 3pn - level equations of motion @xcite .",
    "they have also been derived by an einstein - infeld - hoffmann - type surface - integral approach @xcite .",
    "the 3.5pn terms in the equations of motion are also known @xcite .    concerning the emission of gravitational radiation , two different _ gravitational - wave generation formalisms _",
    "have been developed up to a high pn accuracy : ( i ) the blanchet - damour - iyer formalism @xcite combines a multipolar post - minkowskian ( mpm ) expansion in the exterior zone with a post - newtonian expansion in the near zone ; while ( ii ) the will - wiseman - pati formalism @xcite uses a direct integration of the relaxed einstein equations .",
    "these formalisms were used to compute increasingly accurate estimates of the gravitational waveforms emitted by inspiralling binaries .",
    "these estimates include both normal , near - zone generated post - newtonian effects ( at the 1pn @xcite , 2pn @xcite , and 3pn @xcite levels ) , and more subtle , wave - zone generated ( linear and non - linear ) ` tail effects ' @xcite . however , technical problems arose at the 3pn level .",
    "the representation of black holes by ` delta - function ' sources causes the appearance of dangerously divergent integrals in the 3pn multipole moments . the use of hadamard ( partie finie ) regularization did not allow one to unambiguously compute the needed 3pn - accurate quadrupole moment .",
    "only the use of the ( formally ) diffeomorphism - invariant _ dimensional regularization _ method allowed one to complete the 3pn - level gravitational - radiation formalism @xcite .",
    "the works mentioned in this section ( see @xcite for a detailed account and more references ) finally lead to pn - expanded results for the motion and radiation of binary black holes .",
    "for instance , the equations of motion are given in the form ( @xmath12 ; @xmath13 ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the ` conservative ' 3pn - accurate terms , while @xmath16 denotes the time - asymmetric contibutions , linked to ` radiation reaction ' .",
    "on the other hand , if we consider for simplicity the inspiralling motion of a quasi - circular binary system , the essential quantity describing the emitted gravitational waveform is the _ phase _ @xmath17 of the quadrupolar gravitational wave amplitude @xmath18 .",
    "pn theory allows one to derive several different functional expressions for the gravitational wave phase @xmath17 , as a function either of time or of the instantaneous frequency .",
    "for instance , as a function of time , @xmath17 admits the following explicit expansion in powers of @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 denotes a formal ` time of coalescence ' , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) @xmath23 with some numerical coefficients @xmath24 which depend only on the dimensionless ( symmetric ) mass ratio @xmath22 .",
    "the derivation of the 3.5pn - accurate expansion ( [ eq6.4 ] ) uses both the 3pn - accurate conservative acceleration ( [ eq6.2 ] ) and a 3.5pn extension of the ( fractionally ) 1pn - accurate radiation reaction acceleration ( [ eq6.3 ] ) obtained by assuming a balance between the energy of the binary system and the gravitational - wave energy flux at infinity ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the pn - expanded results briefly reviewed in the previous section are expected to yield accurate descriptions of the motion and radiation of binary black holes only during their _ early inspiralling _ stage , _ i.e. _ as long as the pn expansion parameter @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the distance between the two black holes ) stays significantly smaller than the value @xmath27 where the orbital motion is expected to become dynamically unstable ( ` last stable circular orbit ' and beginning of a ` plunge ' leading to the merger of the two black holes ) .",
    "one needs a better description of the motion and radiation to describe the _ late inspiral _ ( say @xmath28 ) , as well as the subsequent _ plunge _ and _ merger_. one possible strategy for having a complete description of the motion and radiation of binary black holes , covering all the stages ( inspiral , plunge , merger , ring - down ) , would then be to try to ` stitch together ' pn - expanded analytical results describing the early inspiral phase with @xmath29 numerical results describing the end of the inspiral , the plunge , the merger and the ring - down of the final black hole , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    ".    however , we wish to argue that the eob approach makes a better use of all the analytical information contained in the pn - expanded results ( [ eq6.1])-([eq6.3 ] ) .",
    "the basic claim ( first made in @xcite ) is that the use of suitable _ resummation methods _ should allow one to describe , by analytical tools , a _ sufficiently accurate _",
    "approximation of the _ entire waveform _ , from inspiral to ring - down , including the non - perturbative plunge and merger phases . to reach such a goal , one needs to make use of several tools : ( i ) resummation methods , ( ii ) exploitation of the flexibility of analytical approaches , ( iii ) extraction of the non - perturbative information contained in various numerical simulations , ( iv ) qualitative understanding of the basic physical features which determine the waveform .",
    "let us start by discussing the first tool used in the eob approach : the systematic use of resummation methods .",
    "two such methods have been employed ( and combined ) , and some evidence has been given that they do significantly improve the convergence properties of pn expansions .",
    "the first method is the use of _ pad approximants_. it has been shown in ref .  @xcite that near - diagonal pad approximants of the radiation reaction force the _ hamiltonian _ version of the radiation reaction term @xmath30 , eq .",
    "( [ eq6.3 ] ) , in the ( pn - expanded ) equations of motion .",
    "it can be heuristically computed up to ( absolute ) 5.5pn @xcite and even 6pn @xcite order by assuming that the energy radiated in gravitational waves at infinity is balanced by a loss of the dynamical energy of the binary system . ]",
    "@xmath7 seemed to provide a good representation of @xmath7 down to the last stable orbit ( which is expected to occur when @xmath31 , _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath32 ) .",
    "the second method is a novel approach to the dynamics of compact binaries , which constitutes the core of the effective one body ( eob ) method .    for simplicity of exposition ,",
    "let us first explain the eob method at the 2pn level .",
    "the starting point of the method is the 2pn - accurate hamiltonian describing ( in arnowitt - deser - misner - type coordinates ) the conservative , or time symmetric , part of the equations of motion ( [ eq6.1 ] ) ( _ i.e. _ the truncation @xmath33 of eq .",
    "( [ eq6.2 ] ) ) say @xmath34 . by going to the center of mass of the system @xmath35 , one obtains a pn - expanded hamiltonian describing the _ relative motion _ , @xmath36 , @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( with @xmath21 and @xmath40 ) corresponds to the newtonian approximation to the relative motion , while @xmath41 describes 1pn corrections and @xmath42 2pn ones .",
    "it is well known that , at the newtonian approximation , @xmath43 can be thought of as describing a ` test particle ' of mass @xmath44 orbiting around an ` external mass ' @xmath45 .",
    "the eob approach is a _",
    "general relativistic generalization _ of this fact .",
    "it consists in looking for an ` external spacetime geometry ' @xmath46 such that the geodesic dynamics of a ` test particle ' of mass @xmath44 within @xmath47 is _ equivalent _ ( when expanded in powers of @xmath48 ) to the original , relative pn - expanded dynamics ( [ eq7.1 ] ) .",
    "let us explain the idea , proposed in @xcite , for establishing a ` dictionary ' between the real relative - motion dynamics , ( [ eq7.1 ] ) , and the dynamics of an ` effective ' particle of mass @xmath44 moving in @xmath47 .",
    "the idea consists in ` thinking quantum mechanically ' . instead of thinking in terms of a classical hamiltonian , @xmath49 ( such as @xmath50 , eq .",
    "( [ eq7.1 ] ) ) , and of its classical bound orbits , we can think in terms of the quantized energy levels @xmath51 of the quantum bound states of the hamiltonian operator @xmath52 .",
    "these energy levels will depend on two ( integer valued ) quantum numbers @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "here ( for a spherically symmetric interaction , as appropriate to @xmath55 ) , @xmath54 parametrizes the total orbital angular momentum ( @xmath56 ) , while @xmath53 represents the ` principal quantum number ' @xmath57 , where @xmath58 ( the ` radial quantum number ' ) denotes the number of nodes in the radial wave function .",
    "the third ` magnetic quantum number ' @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 ) does not enter the energy levels because of the spherical symmetry of the two - body interaction ( in the center of of mass frame ) .",
    "for instance , a non - relativistic coulomb ( or newton ! ) interaction @xmath61 gives rise to the well - known result @xmath62 which depends only on @xmath53 ( this is the famous coulomb degeneracy ) .",

    "the _ resummed _ eob waveform has been compared to two different ( equal - mass ) nr waveforms : ( i ) in the comparison with the very accurate inspiralling simulation of the caltech - cornell group @xcite the dephasing stayed smaller than @xmath220 gw cycles over 30 gw cycles ( and the amplitudes agreed at the @xmath227 level ) @xcite ; ( ii ) in the comparison with a late - inspiral - merger - ringdown nr waveform computed by the albert einstein institute group , the dephasing stayed smaller than @xmath221 gw cycles over 12 gw cycles .",
