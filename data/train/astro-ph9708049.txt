    "the ability of rosat to study fainter x - ray sources than ever before opened up the range of quasars that could be reached to span virtually the whole of their properties .",
    "high redshift objects ( up to z@xmath9 ) became accessible in x - rays , and their spectrum was measured for the first time between 0.4 and 10 kev ( in the quasar frame , elvis et al 1994a ) .",
    "unexpected low energy cut - offs , far larger than those expected due to absorption by our galaxy , were detected in several high - z radio - loud quasars ( wilkes et al .",
    "1993 , elvis et al .",
    "the obvious possibility was that these were caused by photoelectric absorption , either along the line of sight , or at the quasar .",
    "if the absorber were at the quasar , then the material could be nuclear , as in low redshift low luminosity objects ( e.g. elvis & lawrence , 1985 , and elvis , mathur & wilkes 1995 ) or could be on the larger scale of the host galaxy or proto - galaxy .",
    "a tentative link with the highly compact ` gigahertz peaked ' ( gps ) radio sources suggested the latter and hence that x - ray astronomy offered a new probe of early galaxy conditions .",
    "targeted rosat studies of high redshift quasar x - ray spectra are , however , limited to a dozen or so objects . within",
    "the more than 3000 rosat pspc pointings ( covering about 10 % of the sky ) lie more than 50,000 sources ( white , giommi & angelini 1995 , voges et al 1994 ) . out of these , a sample of several hundred quasar x - ray spectra can be readily compiled for the first time , thanks to the release of the two source catalogs , wgacat ( white , giommi & angelini 1995 ) and rosatsrc ( voges et al 1994 ) .",
    "we have used these data to explore the questions raised by the initial pspc high redshift quasar studies . as an additional benefit of this program",
    "we are able to study the emission spectra of a large sample of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars and study their differences .",
    "we investigate the connection between low energy x - ray cut - offs and the radio and optical spectra of these quasars in a companion paper ( elvis et al .",
    "1997 , paper ii ) . a later paper ( nicastro et al .",
    "1997 ) will discuss a sub - sample of quasars selected to have the typical colors produced by absorption features imprinted on the x - ray spectrum by an ionized absorber along the line of sight .",
    "we use a friedman cosmology with h@xmath10=50  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 and @xmath12 throughout this paper .",
    "quasars were selected by cross - correlating the first revision of the wga catalog ( white , giommi & angelini 1995 ) with a variety of optical and radio catalogs , including the veron - cetty & veron ( 1993 ) and hewitt & burbidge ( 1993 ) quasar catalogs , and the 1 jy ( stickel et al . 1994 ) and s4 ( stickel & khr 1994 ) radio catalogs .",
    "uncertain classifications and border line objects have been also checked in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "all the objects selected have optical spectra dominated by nonstellar emission and all show broad emission lines .",
    "the maximum radius adopted for identifying cross - correlation candidates was one arcminute .",
    "the resulting distribution of x - ray / optical offsets is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the mean offset is @xmath13 arcsec , while the median one is @xmath14 arcsec , in agreement with the estimated errors on the positions of the wga sources ( white et al .",
    "potential mis - identifications through chance co - incidences were addressed by shifting the x - ray positions by various amounts several times , and repeating the cross - correlations .",
    "using these randomized x - ray positions establishes the chance co - incidence rate to be small .",
    "the number of spurious x - ray / optical associations is at maximum 2 , i.e. less than 0.5% of the whole sample ( see below ) .",
    "we excluded from the sample :    1 .",
    "observations of sources with a quality flag in the wga catalog @xmath15 ( corresponding to problematic detections ) ; 2 .",
    "observations of sources with a signal to noise ratio in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev energy band less than 7 ( to ensure reasonable x - ray color determinations ) ; 3 .",
    "observations of quasars located at an off - axis angle larger than 45 arcmin , ( to avoid large systematic errors due to the uncertainties in the pspc calibration near the edge of the field of view ) ; 4 .   fields with a galactic @xmath2 along the line of sight higher than @xmath16 @xmath17 ( to ensure good low energy signal to noise ) ; 5 .",
    "quasars with z@xmath18 ( to eliminate the low luminosity seyfert galaxies in which absorption is common , e.g. lawrence & elvis 1982 ) .",
    "we are then left with 453 quasars for which fluxes in three bands , and so two x - ray colors ( `` soft '' and `` hard '' ) , can be derived .",
    "this is the largest sample of quasars for which homogeneous x - ray spectral information is available .",
    "we used only one observation for each quasar .",
    "when more than one observation was available for a quasar we chose the one with the highest signal to noise ratio .    of these quasars",
    "202 have a radio measurement in the literature , and 167 of those are radio - loud according to the usually adopted definition @xmath19 , with @xmath20 radio flux at 5 ghz and @xmath21 the b - band flux ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ; kellermann et al . 1989 ; stocke et al . 1992 ) .",
    "this translates into a ( rest - frame ) value of the radio to optical spectral index , @xmath22 .",
    "the sample includes 87 flat spectrum radio quasars ( @xmath23 ) , the majority of which are discussed by padovani et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "steep spectrum radio quasars account for 62 sources .",
    "note that this flat / steep classification is based mostly on the radio spectrum at only 2 or 3 frequencies .",
    "quasars with complex radio spectra ( e.g. gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources ) could appear in either class .",
    "this classification also does not distinguish compact steep spectrum ( css ) radio sources from extended ones . for 18 radio - loud quasars",
    "we could find radio measurements at one frequency only , and therefore their radio spectral index is unknown .",
    "we assumed @xmath24 in calculating @xmath25 .",
    "most of the quasars without radio measurement are likely to be radio - quiet ( e.g. ciliegi et al . , 1995 ) so we include them in the radio - quiet sample , making for 286 radio - quiet quasars in the sample .",
    "in the wgacat there are another 35 quasars with galactic @xmath26 but passing all other above points , for which we derive a `` hard '' color only .",
    "of these 28 are radio - loud .    the redshift distributions for radio - quiet quasars and radio - loud quasars",
    "is shown in figure 2 . at z@xmath27",
    "the number of radio - quiet objects is higher than that of radio - loud , due to the higher volume density of radio - quiet quasars .",
    "by z@xmath7 however , the number of radio - loud objects is higher than that of the radio - quiet objects , due to the higher @xmath28 of radio - loud quasars .",
    "the wga catalog provides raw count rates in three energy bands : 0.1 - 0.4 kev ( soft band , s ) , 0.40 - 0.86 kev ( mid band , m ) and 0.87 - 2 kev ( hard band , h ) for each entry .",
    "the count rates can be combined to form a ` softness ratio ' ( sr = s / m ) and a ` hardness ratio ' ( hr = h / m ) . to allow for the effect of the varying galactic absorption from source to source these softness and hardness ratios",
    "can be converted to ` effective spectral energy indices ' , @xmath0 ( 0.1 - 0.8 kev ) , and @xmath1 ( 0.4 - 2.4 kev ) , assuming the galactic @xmath2 as derived from 21 cm measurements ( stark et al 1992 , shafer et al , private communication , heiles & cleary 1979),``wisconsin '' cross - sections ( morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) and solar abundances ( anders & ebihara 1982 ) , and using the pspc calibration .      in converting the three count rates into effective spectral indices , corrections must be applied for the instrumental point spread function ( psf ) , to take into account the different fraction of counts lost outside the detection region in each energy band .",
    "the total pspc psf includes two main components : the mirror psf and the pspc detector psf ( hasinger et al 1992a ) .",
    "the mirror psf is energy independent , and dominates the total psf at off - axis angles greater than about 20 arcmin . at these large",
    "off - axis angles a small detection region loses flux but does not significantly alter the spectral shape .",
    "the detector psf is , instead , highly energy dependent , and dominates the total psf at small off - axis angles . using a small detection region for an off - axis angle @xmath29 arcmin can strongly alter the spectral shape , predominantly at low energies .",
    "( the detector fwhm@xmath30 .",
    "the method used in the wga catalog to estimate the source count rates uses the counts detected in a box whose size optimizes the signal to noise ratio for each source . for relatively weak sources near the field center , this optimum box size is small , and the number of soft photons lost is greater than that of medium or hard energy photons , giving rise to an artificial reduction of the spectrum at low energies , which in turn can lead to an underestimation of @xmath0 of up to 0.2 - 0.3 .",
    "we corrected the count rates in the three bands for both mirror and pspc psf effects .",
    "we used the analytical approximations for the energy and off - axis angle dependence of the psf provided by hasinger et al ( 1992b ) .",
    "this method of estimating spectral indices is similar to the de - reddening procedure used in optical photometry , and is quite robust , with typical systematic uncertainties on @xmath1 smaller than 0.1 ( as shown , for example , by padovani & giommi 1996 or ciliegi & maccacaro 1996 ) .",
    "it is particularly suitable for handling large samples of objects ( giommi et al .",
    ", in preparation ) e.g. for the determination of the x - ray spectral index distributions .    however , a systematic uncertainty is present in the spectral indices estimates , because the magnitude of the psf correction depends on the intrinsic source spectrum . to estimate the magnitude of this uncertainty we calculated five series of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for a grid of assumed source spectra : for the average value for high galactic latitude line of sight ( @xmath31 @xmath17 ) we used @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; for the mean value of energy spectral index ( @xmath35=1.5 ) we used low ( @xmath36 @xmath17 ) and high ( @xmath37 @xmath17 ) absorption values .",
    "we then calculated the differences between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 calculated for each pair of @xmath35 and @xmath2 and those calculated for @xmath33 and @xmath31 @xmath17 .",
    "the differences in @xmath1 were always smaller than 0.05 and those in @xmath0 were always smaller than 0.15 .",
    "we therefore use these values as systematic uncertainties in the evaluation of these parameters .",
    "the wgacat count rates are not background subtracted .",
    "therefore , another possible source of error in the evaluation of the pspc spectral indices is the pspc background in the three wgacat bands .",
    "the pspc background has been studied in great detail by snowden et al ( 1992 , 1994 , noncosmic background , and 1995 , 1997 diffuse , cosmic x - ray background ) using rosat all sky survey ( rass ) data and pointed observation data . the energy band which shows , by far",
    ", the highest background at high galactic latitude is the 0.1 - 0.28  kev range , which spans most of the soft band defined in wgacat ( 0.1 - 0.4  kev ) we now analyze the effect that a wrong or absent background subtraction in the soft band can have on the soft energy index @xmath0 .",
    "the cosmic background in the soft band is highly spatially variable , with large regions of maxima of about 0.0015 counts  s@xmath11 arcmin@xmath38 at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath39 ) and minima of 0.0003 counts s@xmath11 arcmin@xmath38 .",
    "long - term enhancements are difficult to identify and model in pointed observations .",
    "they mainly affect the low frequency part of the spectrum , e@xmath40 kev , where their contribution can even be as high as 0.001 counts s@xmath11 arcmin@xmath38 .",
    "we adpot a conservative value for the total soft band background of 0.003 counts  s@xmath11  arcmin@xmath38 .",
    "the typical box - side of the wgacat extraction regions is 0.3 - 0.8 arcmin for off - axis angles smaller than 20 arcmin and 1 - 3 arcmin for off - axis angles between 20 and 45 arcmin , where the lower limits apply to the faintest sources .",
    "such extraction regions , together with the above background rate would give a few counts in the low energy band in typical exposures of 1000 - 10000 sec for sources detected in the central 20 arcmin , and a few tens of counts for sources detected in the outer pspc region .",
    "let us assume the case of a faint ( close to our limit of 7 in signal to noise ratio ) and strongly cutoff source , whose counts in the soft band are a few , comparable with the background contribution , and 15 - 30 in the medium band . in this case",
    "the upper limit on the slope between the soft and medium energy bands differs from the slope we would measure neglecting background subtraction by @xmath41 .",
    "this compares with a typical statistical error in @xmath42 of 0.5 - 0.7 for such faint sources and with a systematic uncertainty of 0.15 we conclude that the small extraction regions used in the wgacat means that background is not a significant problem , even for the soft band count rate of our faint sources . as a result we did not subtract background in the evaluation of the effective spectral indices",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 .    to investigate the robustnes of this assumption , we searched for correlations between the soft and hard effective spectral indices and ( 1 ) the size of the extraction region , ( 2 ) the off - axis angle , and ( 3 ) the source count rate .",
    "any correlations would be evidence that neglecting the background was causing problems . in no case",
    "did we find significant correlations .",
    "we conclude that neglecting the background subtraction does not strongly affect or bias our results .",
    "there are other two sources of uncertainties in the spectral indices estimates : first , quasars located near the pspc rib structures can suffer a preferential loss of soft photons .",
    "we inspected the original rosat images for each source that appeared to have unusually low soft band counts and rejected those that might have been so affected .",
    "second , the spectral indices estimates from hardness ratios may be significantly different from the results of a proper spectral fit to the full pha spectrum , in presence of a curvature in the intrinsic spectrum , because of the skewness induced in the broad energy bands used to construct the hardness ratios .",
    "for all these reasons the effective spectral indices @xmath0 and @xmath1 should not be regarded as a measure of the true emission spectral indices .",
    "they should rather be regarded as a rough estimation of the `` average '' soft and hard spectral shapes .",
    "they are the soft x - ray analogs of ( u - b ) , ( b - v ) colors , for which multiple physical interpretations are possible .",
    "we will use @xmath0 as an indicator of a possible low energy cut - off .",
    "the radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars @xmath0 and @xmath1 are plotted against each other in figure 3a , b . in the radio - loud plot",
    "flat spectrum radio sources are identified by circles , and steep spectrum sources by squares .",
    "high redshift quasars ( z@xmath432.2 ) are shown with filled symbols .",
    "the range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are large and so the different parts of the diagram correspond to radically different spectral shapes .",
    "these are illustrated with three - point spectra in figure 3 .",
    "for the purpose of this paper we are most interested in those for which a low energy cut - off is indicated ( lower center of figure 3 ) .    to study these features more closely we divided the quasars into four redshift bins : 0.1 - 0.5 ; 0.5 - 1 ; 1 - 2.2 ; and z@xmath44 .",
    "table 1 gives the average spectral indices ( @xmath45 ) and their dispersions ( @xmath46 ) in these four redshift bins for both radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars .",
    "the typical statistical uncertainties on @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath470.2 , the systematic uncertainty is at most @xmath48 for @xmath0 and @xmath49 for @xmath1 , so the measured dispersions are not strongly affected by these uncertainties .",

    "the difference of @xmath60.5 in @xmath1 agrees with the widespread finding that radio - loud quasars have flatter x - ray spectra than radio - quiet quasars ( e.g. elvis & wilkes 1987 , laor et al . , 1994 , laor et al . , 1997 , schartel et al",

    "this new result could be interpreted in terms of an additional component in the spectrum of radio - loud quasars above that seen in radio - quiet quasars ( as suggested earlier by e.g. wilkes & elvis 1987 ) .",

    "this tells us with high confidence that the cut - offs are not due to intervening material . intervening material would not ` know ' whether a background quasar was radio - loud or radio - quiet .",
    "the cause of the cut - offs must be physically associated with the quasar in some way .",
    "to quantify the differences with redshift and study their evolution we plot @xmath1 and @xmath0 versus redshift for radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars in figures 5a , b and 6a , b respectively .",

    "the comparison between the rosat and the asca data implies a variation in the absorber column density on a time - scale of less than 2.6 years in this source .",

    "( 1997 ) discuss in detail the possibility that low energy absorption in addition to the 21 cm value in their sample of high redshift quasars may be due to molecular gas .",
    "for the four quasars in common between their and our sample they find no strong evidence for galactic molecular gas absorption .",
    "we note here that our limit on the galactic ( 21 cm ) @xmath2 effectively excludes low galactic latitude sources from our sample , thus minimizing the probability for a contamination from galactic molecular clouds , which are strongly concentrated toward the galactic plane .",
    "the co survey by blitz , magnani & mundy ( 1984 ) finds that molecular gas is uncommon at high galactic latitudes .",
    "the only quasar known to be affected by molecular gas absorption ( nrao140 , marscher 1988 , turner et al . ,",

    "the pspc spectral indices of radio - loud objects show a significant flattening above z@xmath75 , which is interpreted by schartel et al in terms of a selection effect and/or a redshift effect , if quasar spectra are not simple power laws ( but rather have a concave shape ) . in the wgacat",
    "quasars we see little change in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 from 0.1@xmath4z@xmath42 , most of the evolution being confined at redshifts higher than @xmath76 .    on the other hand",

    "this result is consistent with our findings ( see section 3.1.2 above ) based on wgacat quasars . in particular the slopes reported by schartel et al ( 1996b ) agree well with those in table 1 .",
    "again , the study of the evolution of the spectrum of radio - quiet quasars is limited by the fact that high redshift radio - quiet quasars are faint and not easy to observe with rosat .",
    "puchnarewicz et al ( 1996 ) find a mean energy index significant flatter than those obtained from the wgacat quasars .",
    "they also find no evidence for a change in @xmath78 with z. the flat average slope reported by puchnarewicz et al could be due to the selection criteria used to define the sample ( a flux limit of @xmath79 erg @xmath17 s@xmath11 in the rosat 0.4 - 2 kev ` hard band ' ) which favors the inclusion in the sample of flatter agn .",
    "furthermore , the correlation between the optical to x - ray index with the x - ray spectral index ( like the one found in seyfert galaxies and low redshift quasars , see eg .",
    "walter & fink 1993 , fiore et al . 1995 ) can select preferentially flat x - ray quasars when considering a strictly x - ray selected sample ( low optical to x - ray index ) .",
    "we also note ( from their figure 3 ) that in their sample there are a few quasars with a very flat spectral index , possibly due to absorption , which tend to lower the average index .",
    "these quasars have a red optical continuum , strengthening the evidence for absorption in these cases .",
    "also the fraction of radio - loud agn in the rixos is unknown .",
    "the energy index puchnarewicz et al ( 1996 ) find at 2@xmath4z@xmath43 is similar to the index we find in the same redshift interval for radio - loud objects . at low redshift the radio quiet population should dominate in number ( because of its much larger volume density ) .",
    "however , we note that a similar x - ray flux limited survey ( schartel et al 1996a ) is completely dominated by radio loud objects at z@xmath770.5 , since radio - loud objects are brighter in x - rays than radio quiet ( e.g zamorani et al 1981 , green et al 1996 ) . therefore the rixos indices , at least at high redshift , could be dominated by the radio - loud population .",
    "we have studied the 2 color x - ray spectra of a sample of about 167 radio - loud quasars and 286 ` bona fide ' radio - quiet quasars .",
    "radio - loud quasars cover the whole redshift space from 0.1 to 4 rather uniformly , while there are only three radio - quiet quasars at z@xmath56 , against 12 radio - loud quasars at the same redshifts .",
    "any conclusion on radio - quiet quasars then apply to z@xmath80 only .      1 .",
    "low energy x - ray cut - offs are more commonly ( and perhaps exclusively ) associated with radio - loud quasars .",
    "detailed spectral fits allow us to add , with some confidence , that photoelectric absorption is a likely origin of the ` low energy cut - offs ' .",
    "the conclusion is that _ low energy x - ray cut - offs are associated with the quasars _ , and not with intervening systems , since those would affect radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars equally .",
    "2 .   among",
    "radio - loud quasars those at high redshift have a lower mean @xmath0 than those at low z ( p=0.04% ) , with many lying in the x - ray ` cut - off ' zone .",
    "detailed spectral analysis of all candidate cut - off quasars show four robust cut - off detections at redshift higher than 2.2 .",
    "the probability that the fraction of cut - off quasars among the 18 objects at z@xmath44 is similar to that of radio - loud quasars at z@xmath60 is very small , about 0.002 % ( using the binomial distribution ) .",
    "this indicates that cut - offs were more common in the past than they are now .",
    "i.e. _ the x - ray cut - offs show evolution with cosmic epoch . _",
    "the degeneracy between redshift and luminosity found in flux limited samples of quasars was tested by using a partial correlation analysis .",
    "we found that while @xmath0 is truly anti - correlated with redshift at the @xmath3 confidence level , in the case of @xmath1 the observed anti - correlation with redshift is mostly due to a strong dependence on luminosity .",
    "therefore , the cut - offs are an evolutionary , not a luminosity , effect .",
    "+ concerning the emitted x - ray spectra of quasars we have established : 4 .   the distribution of @xmath0 of radio - quiet quasars is consistent with that of @xmath1 for z@xmath80 .",
    "this uniformity suggests a single emission mechanism dominating the whole rosat band ( c.f .",
    "laor et al . ,",
    "1997 ) up to a redshift of about 2 .",
    "we find a marginal evidence for a flattening of @xmath1 ( p=4.5 % ) going from z@xmath41 to z=2 , in agreement with previous studies ( schartel et al 1996b ) .",
    "this can be due to a selection effect even if quasar x - ray spectra are simple power laws , because at high redshift the steepest ( and therefore faintest ) sources would not be detected .",
    "however , it is well known that rosat pspc 0.1 - 2 kev spectral indices of seyfert 1 galaxies and low redshift radio - quiet quasars are much steeper than those observed above 2 kev ( e.g. walter & fink 1993 , fiore et al 1994 , laor et al 1997 ) . if the spectrum of these agn is made up of two distinct components that are equal at a typical energy @xmath81 , the flattening of @xmath1 at z@xmath82 would suggest that @xmath81 lies in the range 2 - 4 kev ( quasar frame ) .",
    "radio - loud quasars at z@xmath42.2 show a ` concave ' spectrum ( @xmath5 by @xmath60.2 ) .",
    "both indices are much flatter than those of radio - quiet quasars .",
    "this new result is in line with the suggestion of wilkes & elvis ( 1987 ) that the x - ray spectrum of radio - loud quasars may be due to an additional component above that seen in radio - quiet quasars .",
    "however , it may also imply different processes at work in radio - loud and radio - quiet sources ( as recently suggested by laor et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "+ at z@xmath7 the average soft and hard indices are similar and both significatively smaller than at lower redshifts",

    "padovani et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggested that these quasars are analogs to lbl bl lacs , that is bl lac objects with maximum energy emission in the ir - optical band .",
    "their high energy radiation should then be dominated by inverse compton emission . at z@xmath8",
    "we are then likely seeing pure inverse compton emission . at lower redshift",
    "the rosat pspc band could sample a mixture of inverse compton emission , the tail of the synchrotron component peaking in the infrared and thermal emission from the hypothesized accretion disk .",
