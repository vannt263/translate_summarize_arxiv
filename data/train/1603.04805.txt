    "at the last agacse in 2012 , i presented a new link between the geometries of three and four dimensions ; in particular , i have shown that any reflection group in three dimensions induces a corresponding symmetry group in four dimensions , via a new clifford spinor construction @xcite .",
    "this connection had been overlooked for centuries ( usually one assumes the larger groups are more fundamental ) but the new construction derives all the exceptional phenomena in 4d  @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath2  via induction from the 3d symmetry groups of the platonic solids @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath1 .",
    "this spinor construction also explains the unusual 4d automorphism groups .",
    "the 4d groups in fact do not contain anything that is not already present in the 3d groups they are induced from @xcite .",
    "this begs the obvious question of whether one can derive the largest exceptional geometry @xmath0 , the holy grail of mathematics and physics , in a clifford algebra approach as well .",
    "i have now found a construction that constructs the @xmath0 root system ( see fig .",
    "[ fige8coxpl ] ) in analogy to the above construction going from 3d to 4d @xcite .",
    "this previous construction worked along the following lines : each 3d root system  which generates the corresponding reflection symmetry group via the reflections in the hyperplanes orthogonal to the root vectors  allows one to form a group of spinors by multiplying together even numbers of the reflection generating root vectors in the clifford algebra ; these spinors have four components ( the usual @xmath13 scalar and @xmath14 bivector components ) and one can endow these with a 4d euclidean metric .",
    "one can then show that the resulting set of spinors reinterpreted as 4d vectors satisfies the axioms for a 4d root system , thereby generating a symmetry group in 4d .",
    "for instance , starting with the root system @xmath1 which generates the symmetries of the icosahedron , one generates a group @xmath15 of @xmath3 spinors ( the binary icosahedral group ) via multiplication in the clifford algebra .",
    "these are precisely the @xmath3 root vectors of the 4d root system @xmath2 once reinterpreted using the 4d euclidean metric .",
    "@xmath2 is exceptional and the largest non - crystallographic coxeter group ; it also has the exceptional automorphism group @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however , this is trivial to see in terms of the spinor group @xmath15 , as it must be trivially closed under left and right multiplication via group closure .    taking the full set of pinors ( i.e. not restricting to even products of root vectors ) of the icosahedron , one generates a group ( doubly covering the @xmath3 elements of @xmath1 ) of @xmath4 pinors with 8 components , as befits a group of multivectors in 3d .",
    "i have now been able to show that these @xmath4 pinors are precisely the @xmath4 roots of @xmath0 by using a reduced inner product , thereby generating the exceptional group @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it is extraordinary that the exceptional geometry @xmath0 has been hiding in the shadows of icosahedral geometry for millennia , without anyone noticing . as with the 4d induction construction",
    ", this discovery seems only possible in clifford algebra .",
    "there is much prejudice against the usefulness of clifford algebras ( since they have matrix representations ) and usually matrix methods are equivalent if less insightful  but the 4d and 8d induction constructions are to my knowledge the only results that require clifford algebra and were completely invisible to standard matrix methods .",
    "this paper is structured in the following way .",
    "after some background and basic definitions in section [ background ] , we summarise the general result that any 3d reflection group induces a 4d symmetry group , via their root systems ( section [ sec_pin ] ) . in terms of their 3d spinors , the platonic root systems @xmath17 thus induce all the exceptional 4d root systems @xmath18 with this spinorial approach also explaining their unusual symmetry groups .",
    "we treat as an illustrative example the case of the icosahedral group @xmath1 whose spinor group is the binary icosahedral group @xmath15 .",
    "it doubly covers the @xmath19 icosahedral rotations in terms of @xmath3 spinors , but when thought of as a collection of 4-component objects is precisely @xmath2 , the exceptional largest non - crystallographic root system .",
    "arnold s trinities contain the above platonic root systems @xmath17 as well as the exceptional lie groups @xmath20 .",
    "they are connected indirectly via various intermediate trinities as well as more explicitly via the new spinor construction in combination with the mckay correspondence .",
    "this therefore hints that the icosahedron may be indirectly connected with @xmath0 .",
    "section [ birth ] makes this explicit for the first time via a new , direct construction @xcite , which explicitly constructs the @xmath4 roots @xmath0 from the @xmath4 pinors that doubly cover the @xmath3 elements of the icosahedral group in the clifford algebra of 3d .",
    "thus * all * the exceptional root systems can be seen to be contained in the geometry of 3d via the platonic symmetries and the clifford algebra of 3d .",
    "this offers a completely new way of viewing these in terms of spinorial geometry .",
    "section [ sec_spin ] discusses @xmath2 as a rotational subgroup of @xmath0 , and thus affords a second way of viewing @xmath2 more naturally as a group of rotations rather than reflections ( as is the standard view in the coxeter picture ) .",
    "this construction of @xmath2 from @xmath0 is in fact a partial folding or 4-fold colouring of the @xmath0 diagram , whilst a complete folding leads to the coxeter plane .",
    "we therefore finish by discussing the geometry of the coxeter plane of various root systems , notably @xmath0 , and point out which advantages a clifford algebraic view has to offer over the naive standard view which involves complexifying the real geometry : in clifford algebra the complex eigenvalues in fact arise naturally as rotations in mutually orthogonal eigenplanes of the coxeter element ( section [ coxeterplane ] ) with the bivectors of the planes providing the relevant complex structures ; we conclude in section [ concl ] and again stress that for root systems and reflection groups clifford algebra is the most natural framework .",
    "lie groups are a ubiquitous in mathematics and physics . in particular ,",
    "the largest exceptional lie group @xmath0 is of fundamental importance in string theory and grand unified theories and is thus arguably the single most important symmetry group in modern theoretical physics .",
    "lie groups are continuous ( group manifolds ) but they are closely related to their corresponding lie algebras whose non - trivial part in turn is described by a root system :    [ defrootsys ] a _ root system _ is a collection @xmath21 of non - zero ( root ) vectors @xmath22 spanning an @xmath23-dimensional euclidean vector space @xmath24 endowed with a positive definite bilinear form , which satisfies the two axioms :    1 .",
    "@xmath21 only contains a root @xmath22 and its negative , but no other scalar multiples : @xmath25 .",
    "2 .   @xmath21 is invariant under all reflections corresponding to root vectors in @xmath21 : @xmath26 .",
    "the reflection @xmath27 in the hyperplane with normal @xmath22 is given by @xmath28[refl ] where @xmath29 denotes the inner product on @xmath24 .",
    "for a crystallographic root system , a subset @xmath30 of @xmath21 , called _ simple roots _ @xmath31 , is sufficient to express every element of @xmath21 via @xmath32-linear combinations with coefficients of the same sign .",
    "@xmath21 is therefore completely characterised by this basis of simple roots . in the case of the non - crystallographic root systems",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the same holds for the extended integer ring @xmath34=\\lbrace a+\\tau b| a , b \\in \\mathbb{z}\\rbrace$ ] , where @xmath35 is the golden ratio @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is its galois conjugate @xmath38 ( the two solutions to the quadratic equation @xmath39 ) . for the crystallographic root systems , the classification in terms of dynkin diagrams essentially follows the one familiar from lie groups and lie algebras , as their weyl groups are the crystallographic coxeter groups .",
    "a mild generalisation to so - called coxeter - dynkin diagrams is necessary for the non - crystallographic root systems :    a graphical representation of the geometric content of a root system is given by _",
    "coxeter - dynkin diagrams _ , where nodes correspond to simple roots , orthogonal roots are not connected , roots at @xmath40 have a simple link , and other angles @xmath41 have a link with a label @xmath42 .",
    "the _ cartan matrix _ of a set of simple roots @xmath43 is defined as the matrix @xmath44 .",
    "for instance , the root system of the icosahedral group @xmath1 has one link labelled by @xmath45 ( via the above relation @xmath46 ) , as does its four - dimensional analogue @xmath2 .",
    "the reflections in the second axiom of the root system generate a reflection group .",
    "a coxeter group is a mathematical abstraction of the concept of a reflection group via involutive generators ( i.e. they square to the identity , which captures the idea of a reflection ) , subject to mixed relations that represent @xmath42-fold rotations ( since two successive reflections generate a rotation in the plane defined by the two roots ) .",
    "a _ coxeter group _ is a group generated by a set of involutive generators @xmath47 subject to relations of the form @xmath48 with @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "the finite coxeter groups have a geometric representation where the involutions are realised as reflections at hyperplanes through the origin in a euclidean vector space @xmath24 , i.e. they are essentially just the classical reflection groups .",
    "in particular , then the abstract generator @xmath51 corresponds to the simple reflection @xmath52 in the hyperplane perpendicular to the simple root @xmath53 .",
    "the action of the coxeter group is to permute these root vectors , and its structure is thus encoded in the collection @xmath54 of all such roots , which in turn form a root system .",
    "it is thus straightforward to move between those four related concepts of lie groups / algebras , root systems and coxeter groups and we will usually not make a distinction  with the exception of non - crystallographic root systems such as @xmath1 ( which generates icosahedral symmetry ) and its 4d analogue @xmath2 : their non - crystallographic nature means that there is no associated lie algebra , since going to the lie algebra level in the kac - moody approach the cartan matrix entries appear in the chevalley - serre relations as powers of the generators , which have to be integers rather than @xmath34 $ ] integers .    the @xmath0 root system is thus usually thought of as an exceptional ( i.e. there are no corresponding symmetry groups in arbitrary dimensions ) phenomenon of eight - dimensional geometry , with no connection to the 3d geometry we inhabit .",
    "surprisingly , the eight dimensions of 3d clifford algebra actually allow @xmath0 to fit into our 3d geometry ; likewise all 4d exceptional root systems arise within 3d geometry from the platonic symmetries , unveiling them all as intrinsically 3d phenomena .",
    "this opens up a revolutionary way of viewing exceptional higher - dimensional geometries in terms of 3d spinorial geometry .",
    "we employ a clifford algebra framework , which via the geometric product by @xmath55 affords a uniquely simple prescription for performing reflections @xmath56 ( assuming unit normalisation ) .",
    "this yields a double cover of the reflections ( since @xmath22 and @xmath57 give the same reflection ) and thus via the cartan - diedonn theorem ( which allows one to express any orthogonal transformation as the product of reflections ) one gets a double cover of all orthogonal transformations @xmath58 , in spaces of any dimension and signature , by products of unit vectors @xmath59 called versors .",
    "we also call even versors spinors , as they doubly cover the special orthogonal transformations , and general versors pinors , as they doubly cover the orthogonal transformations .",
    "the non - exceptional lie groups have been realised as spin groups in geometric algebra @xcite , and lie algebras as bivector algebras ; here we offer a clifford geometric construction of all the exceptional phenomena via their root systems .",
    "of course , @xmath2 does not even have an associated lie algebra and lie group and therefore could not be constructed as a spin group or bivector algebra .",
    "we therefore advocate the root system as the most convenient , insightful and fundamental concept : for a root system , the quadratic form mentioned in the definition can always be used to enlarge the @xmath23-dimensional vector space @xmath24 to the corresponding @xmath60-dimensional clifford algebra .",
    "the clifford algebra is therefore a very natural object to consider in this context , as its unified structure simplifies many problems both conceptually and computationally , rather than applying the linear structure of the space and the inner product separately . in particular",
    ", it provides the above ( s)pinor double covers of the ( special ) orthogonal transformations , as well as geometric quantities that serve as unit imaginaries .",
    "we will see the benefits of those throughout the paper .",
    "we will largely be working with the clifford algebra of 3d generated by three orthogonal unit vectors @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which is itself an eight - dimensional vector space consisting of the elements @xmath64",
    "in this section we prove that any 3d root system yields a 4d root system via the spinor group obtained by multiplying together root vectors in the clifford algebra @xcite .",
    "[ hga_o4 ] the space of @xmath65-spinors @xmath66 can be endowed with a _",
    "4d euclidean norm _",
    "@xmath67 induced by the _ inner product _ @xmath68 between two spinors @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this allows one to reinterpret the group of 3d spinors generated from a 3d root system as a set of 4d vectors , which in fact can be shown to satisfy the axioms of a root system as given in definition [ defrootsys ] .",
    "[ hga_4drootsys ] any 3d root system gives rise to a spinor group @xmath71 which induces a root system in 4d .",
    "check the two axioms for the root system @xmath21 consisting of the set of 4d vectors given by the 3d spinor group :    1 .   by construction",
    ", @xmath21 contains the negative of a root @xmath72 since spinors provide a double cover of rotations , i.e. if @xmath72 is in a spinor group @xmath71 , then so is @xmath73 , but no other scalar multiples ( normalisation to unity ) .",
    "@xmath21 is invariant under all reflections with respect to the inner product @xmath74 in proposition [ hga_o4 ] since @xmath75 for @xmath76 by the closure property of the group @xmath71 ( in particular @xmath73 and @xmath77 are in @xmath71 if @xmath72 is ) .",
    "since the irreducible 3d root systems are @xmath17 , the induction construction also yields three induced root systems in 4d .",
    "these are in fact the exceptional root systems in 4d @xmath18",
    ". both sets of three are in fact amongst arnold s trinities following his observation that @xmath78 @xcite form a basic unit of three which can be extended to analogous sets of three such as the corresponding projective spaces , lie algebras of @xmath79-type @xmath20 , spheres , hopf fibrations etc .",
    "this is the first very tentative hint that the icosahedral group @xmath1 might be related to the exceptional geometry @xmath0 .",
    "arnolds original link between @xmath17 and @xmath18 is similarly extremely convoluted / indirect , whilst our construction presents a novel direct link between the two ; we will first make the @xmath1 and @xmath0 connection more suggestive below , before making it explicit for the first time .",
    "these root systems are intimately linked to the platonic solids @xcite .",
    "there are 5 in three dimensions and 6 in four dimensions : @xmath11 describes the reflection symmetries of the tetrahedron , @xmath12 those of the cube and octahedron ( which are dual under the exchange of midpoints of faces and vertices ) , and @xmath1 describes the symmetries of the dual pair icosahedron and dodecahedron ( the rotational subgroup is denoted by @xmath80 ) , whilst the 4d coxeter groups describe the symmetries of the 4d platonic solids . but this time the connection is much more immediate : the platonic solids are actually root systems themselves ( or duals thereof ) .",
    "@xmath9 is the @xmath81-cell ( self - dual ) , an analogue of the tetrahedron , which is also related to the @xmath10 root system .",
    "the @xmath2 root system is the platonic solid the @xmath82-cell with its dual , the @xmath3-cell ( also platonic ) , having the same symmetry .",
    "@xmath83 generates @xmath84 , which constitutes the @xmath85-cell  its dual is the @xmath86-cell , both are platonic solids .",
    "there is thus an abundance of root systems in 4d giving the platonic solids , which is essentially due to the accidentalness of the spinor induction theorem , compared to arbitrary dimensions where the only root systems and platonic solids are @xmath87 ( @xmath23-simplex ) , @xmath88 ( @xmath23-hypercube and @xmath23-hyperoctahedron ) and @xmath89 .",
    "in fact the only 4d platonic solid that is not equal or dual to a root system is the @xmath45-cell with symmetry group @xmath90 , which of course could not be a root system , as its odd number ( @xmath45 ) of vertices violates the first root system axiom .    the induced root systems @xmath18 are precisely the exceptional ones in 4d , where we count @xmath9 as exceptional because of its exceptional triality symmetry ( permutation symmetry of the three legs in the diagram accidental in 4d ) .",
    "it is of great importance in string theory , showing the equivalence of the ramond - neveu - schwarz and the green - schwarz strings .",
    "@xmath10 is the only @xmath91-type root system , and @xmath2 is the largest non - crystallographic root system .",
    "they therefore naturally form a trinity .    on top of the exceptional nature of these root systems ( their existence )",
    ", they also have very unusual automorphism groups .",
    "this is readily shown via the above spinor construction :    [ hgasymmetry ] a root system induced through the clifford spinor construction via a binary polyhedral spinor group @xmath71 has an automorphism group that trivially contains two factors of the respective spinor group @xmath71 acting from the left and from the right .",
    "this systematises many case - by - case observations on the structure of the automorphism groups @xcite ( for instance , the automorphism group of the @xmath2 root system is @xmath16  in the spinor picture , it is not surprising that @xmath15 yields both the root system and the two factors in the automorphism group ) , and shows that all of the 4d geometry is already contained in 3d @xcite in the following sense . in terms of quaternionic representations of a 4d root system ( e.g. @xmath2 ) , the 3d root system ( @xmath1 ) is often remarked in the literature to consist precisely of the pure quaternions , i.e. those without a real part , and the full 4d group can be generated from these under quaternion multiplication .",
    "this is very poorly understood in the literature : in our picture the spinors are just isomorphic to the quaternions whilst when the inversion @xmath92 is contained in the full group , one can trivially hodge dualise vectors to bivectors ( pure quaternions ) . however , this statement is not true when the inversion is not contained in the group ( e.g. for @xmath11 ) .",
    "conversely , the spinorial induction construction still works perfectly well yielding @xmath9 .",
    "i.e. the fact that the 3d group is generated by the subset of the pure quaternions amongst the 4d group under quaternion multiplication is just a corollary of spinor induction when the inversion is contained in the group .",
    "the literature has it ` backwards ' deriving the 3d root system from the 4d root system ( under inconsistent conditions ) , whilst in our picture the 3d root systems are more fundamental as they allow us to construct the 4d root system without any further information .",
    "moreover , the ` quaternionic generators ' generating the 4d groups via quaternion multiplication cited in the literature are easily seen to just be the products of pairs of 3d simple roots ( spinors ) @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "thus the 4d group clearly does not contain anything that was not already contained in the 3d group , and we therefore argue that 3d root systems and spinor induction are fundamental rather than the 4d root systems .",
    "we consider the examples of the inductions of @xmath95 and @xmath96 in more detail .",
    "for the former , the @xmath97 roots can be chosen as @xmath98 .",
    "pairwise products yield the @xmath86 spinors @xmath99 .",
    "3d spinors have four components ( @xmath13 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) , such that these @xmath86 spinors give the @xmath86 vertices of the ( 4d root system and platonic solid ) @xmath85-cell @xmath103 we now also construct the spinor group generated by the simple roots of @xmath1 , which we take as @xmath104 under multiplication with the geometric product they generate a group of @xmath4 pinors doubly covering the @xmath3 elements of @xmath1 .",
    "its even subgroup consists of @xmath3 spinors doubly covering the rotational subgroup @xmath105 , e.g. @xmath106 and @xmath107 . taking the components of these @xmath3 spinors in 4d yields exactly the @xmath2 root system @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 this is very surprising from a coxeter perspective , as one usually thinks of @xmath1 as a subgroup of @xmath2 , and therefore of @xmath2 as more fundamental .",
    "however , we have seen that @xmath2 does not actually contain anything that is not already in @xmath1 , which makes @xmath1 more fundamental @xcite . from a clifford perspective",
    "it is not at all surprising to find this group of @xmath3 spinors ( the binary icosahedral group @xmath15 ) since it is well - known that clifford algebra provides a simple construction of the spin groups .",
    "however , this is extremely surprising from the conventional coxeter and lie group point of view .",
    "it is convenient to have all the four different types of polyhedral groups ( chiral , full , binary , pin ) in a unified framework within the clifford algebra , rather than using @xmath111 matrices for the rotations and then having to use @xmath112 matrices for the binary groups , as one can perform all the different group operations with multivectors in the same clifford algebra . for instance , the spinor group @xmath15 consists of @xmath3 elements and @xmath113 conjugacy classes , as one can easily confirm by explicit computation .",
    "@xmath105 has five conjugacy classes and is of order @xmath19 , which implies that it has five irreducible representations of dimensions @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath45 .",
    "the nine conjugacy classes of the binary icosahedral group @xmath15 of order @xmath3 therefore mean that it has a further four irreducible spinorial representations @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "this binary icosahedral group has a mysterious two - fold connection with the affine lie algebra @xmath120 via the so - called mckay correspondence @xcite , which in fact applies to all other binary polyhedral groups and the affine lie algebras of @xmath121-type ( c.f .",
    "figure [ figmckay ] ) : firstly , we can define a graph by assigning a node to each of the nine irreducible representation of the binary icosahedral group where we connect nodes according to its tensor product structure : each irreducible representation is represented by a node and it is only connected to other nodes corresponding to those irreducible representations that are contained in its tensor product with the irreducible representation @xmath116 . for instance , tensoring the trivial representation @xmath13 with @xmath116 trivially gives @xmath122 and thus @xmath13 is only connected to @xmath116 ; @xmath123 , such that @xmath116 is connected to @xmath13 ( as we know ) and also to @xmath14 , and so on .",
    "the graph that is built up in this way is precisely the dynkin diagram of affine @xmath0 ( figure [ fige6aff ] ) .",
    "secondly the order of the coxeter element ( the product of all the simple reflections @xmath124 ) , the coxeter number @xmath125 , is @xmath8 for @xmath0 , which is also exactly the sum of the dimensions of the irreducible representations of @xmath15 , @xmath126 .",
    "as already stated , these both extend to a correspondence between all binary polyhedral groups and the @xmath121-type affine lie algebras .    at ( -1,.7 ) ( knoten0 ) [ knoten , color = white!0!black , ball color = white ] ; at ( 1,.7 ) ( knoten1 ) [ knoten , color = white!0!black , ball color = white ] ; at ( 3,.7 ) ( knoten2 ) [ knoten , color = white!0!black , ball color = white ] ; at ( 5,.7 ) ( knoten3 ) [ knoten , color = white!0!black , ball color = white ] ; at ( 7,.7 ) ( knoten4 ) [ knoten , color = white!0!black , ball color = white ] ; at ( 9,.7 ) ( knoten6 ) [ knoten , color = white!0!black , ball color = white ] ; at ( 11,.7 ) ( knoten7 ) [ knoten , color = white!0!black , ball color = white ] ; at ( 13,.7 ) ( knoten8 ) [ knoten , color = white!0!black , ball color = white ] ; at ( 9,2.7 ) ( knoten9 ) [ knoten , color = white!0!black , ball color = white ] ;    at ( -1,0 ) ( alpha0 ) @xmath13;at ( 1,0 ) ( alpha1 ) @xmath116;at ( 3,0 ) ( alpha2 ) @xmath14;at ( 5,0 ) ( alpha3 ) @xmath127;at ( 7,0 ) ( alpha4 ) @xmath45;at ( 9,0 ) ( alpha5 ) @xmath128;at ( 11,0 ) ( alpha6 ) @xmath115 ; at ( 9.7,2.8 ) ( alpha7 ) @xmath114;at ( 13,0 ) ( alpha8 ) @xmath117 ; ( knoten0 ) edge ( knoten1 ) ; ( knoten1 ) edge ( knoten2 ) ; ( knoten2 ) edge ( knoten3 ) ; ( knoten3 ) edge ( knoten4 ) ; ( knoten4 ) edge ( knoten6 ) ; ( knoten6 ) edge ( knoten9 ) ; ( knoten6 ) edge ( knoten7 ) ; ( knoten7 ) edge ( knoten8 ) ;    we can therefore extend the connection between @xmath17 and @xmath129 via the mckay correspondence which links @xmath129 and @xmath20 to a new connection between @xmath17 and @xmath20 via clifford spinors , which does not seem to be known . in particular , @xmath130 is one of the two connections in the mckay correspondence denoting the coxeter number of the affine lie algebra as well as the sum of the dimensions of the irreducible representations of the binary polyhedral group .",
    "we note that @xmath130 is more fundamentally the number of roots @xmath21 in the 3d root systems @xmath17 , which therefore feeds all the way through to the binary polyhedral groups and via the mckay correspondence to the affine lie algebras .",
    "our construction therefore makes deep connections between trinities , and puts the mckay correspondence into a wider framework , as shown in figure [ figmckay ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the affine lie algebra and the 4d root system trinities have identical dynkin diagram symmetries : @xmath9 and @xmath131 have triality @xmath132 , @xmath10 and @xmath133 have an @xmath134 symmetry and @xmath2 and @xmath120 only have @xmath135 , but are intimately related as explained in section [ sec_spin ] . this therefore again suggests that there is a link between the icosahedron and @xmath0 , which is slightly more explicit than just from observing the trinities . in the next section we will show a new , completely explicit direct connection within the clifford algebra of 3d by identifying the @xmath4 roots of @xmath0 with the @xmath4 pinors doubly covering the elements of the icosahedral group @xmath2 ( right of figure [ figmckay ] ) @xcite .     of the binary polyhedral groups and",
    "the coxeter number of the lie algebras actually goes all the way back to the number of roots in the 3d root systems @xmath130 .",
    "these then induce the binary polyhedral groups ( linked via the mckay correspondence to the @xmath79-type affine lie algebras ) and the 4d root systems via the clifford spinor construction .",

    "previously , we have constructed the @xmath3 elements of @xmath15 , which can be reinterpreted as the @xmath3 roots of @xmath2 @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath136 a set of simple roots for these is given e.g. by @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "as we have discussed above the @xmath1 root system contains the inversion @xmath141 .",
    "it simply hodge dualises the @xmath3 spinors doubly covering the even subgroup @xmath105 of @xmath19 rotations to create a second copy consisting of vector and pseudoscalar parts .",
    "this gives the @xmath3 additional group elements necessary to provide the @xmath4 pinor double covering of the group @xmath142 of order @xmath3 .",

    "this offers a revolutionarily new way of viewing these phenomena in terms of spinorial geometry of 3d as intrinsically 3d phenomena , with huge potential implications for the many areas in which these symmetries appear .",
    "likewise , the geometry of the coxeter plane is best viewed in a clifford algebra framework , which provides geometric meaning and insight , for instance the complex eigenvalues in standard theory are just seen to be rotations in eigenplanes of the coxeter element given by bivectors which act as unit imaginaries . since the definition of root systems stipulates a vector space with an inner product , the associated clifford algebra of this space can easily be constructed without any loss of generality and is actually the most natural framework to use for such root systems and coxeter groups , both since clifford algebra affords a uniquely simple reflection formula and since combining the linear structure of the space with the inner product is better than using both separately .",

    "<S> this paper considers the geometry of @xmath0 from a clifford point of view in three complementary ways . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , in earlier work , i had shown how to construct the four - dimensional exceptional root systems from the 3d root systems using clifford techniques , by constructing them in the 4d even subalgebra of the 3d clifford algebra ; for instance the icosahedral root system @xmath1 gives rise to the largest ( and therefore exceptional ) non - crystallographic root system @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> arnold s trinities and the mckay correspondence then hint that there might be an indirect connection between the icosahedron and @xmath0 . secondly , in a related construction </S>",
    "<S> , i have now made this connection explicit for the first time : in the 8d clifford algebra of 3d space the @xmath3 elements of the icosahedral group @xmath1 are doubly covered by @xmath4 8-component objects , which endowed with a ` reduced inner product ' are exactly the @xmath0 root system . it was previously known that @xmath0 splits into @xmath2-invariant subspaces , and we discuss the folding construction relating the two pictures . this folding is a partial version of the one used for the construction of the coxeter plane , so thirdly we discuss the geometry of the coxeter plane in a clifford algebra framework . </S>",
    "<S> we advocate the complete factorisation of the coxeter versor in the clifford algebra into exponentials of bivectors describing rotations in orthogonal planes with the rotation angle giving the correct exponents , which gives much more geometric insight than the usual approach of complexification and search for complex eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we explicitly find these factorisations for the 2d , 3d and 4d root systems , @xmath5 as well as @xmath0 , whose coxeter versor factorises as @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this explicitly describes 30-fold rotations in 4 orthogonal planes with the correct exponents @xmath7 arising completely algebraically from the factorisation .    </S>",
