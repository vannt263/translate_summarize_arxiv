    "one of the main challenges in physics today is the search of a quantum theory of gravity ( qtg ) .",
    "a major difficulty in the development of such theories is the lack of experimentally accessible phenomena that could shed light on the possible route to qtg .",
    "such quantum gravitational effects are expected to become relevant near the planck scale , where spacetime itself is assumed to be quantized .",
    "compared to typical energy scales we are able to reach in our experiments , the planck energy is extremely high , too high to hope to be able to test it directly , what makes it so difficult to test such effects .",
    "because the predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy , a possible route to test quantum gravitational effects is through high - sensitivity measurements of well known quantum - mechanical phenomena , as any deviation from the standard theory is , at least in principle , experimentally testable . in this framework , with the best position measurements ( being of the order @xmath0 ) , at present sensitivities are still insufficient and quantum gravitational corrections remain unexplored . despite this limitation , experimental verification of a common modification of the heisenberg uncertainty relation that appears in a vast range of approaches to qtg ,",
    "has been reported in @xcite .",
    "a background independent quantization scheme that arose in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) , the so called polymer quantization ( pq ) , has been used to explore mathematical and physical implications of theories such as quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "pq may be viewed as a separate development in its own right , and is applicable to any classical theory whether or not it contains gravity .",
    "its central feature is that the momentum operator @xmath1 is not realized directly as in schrdinger quantum mechanics because of a built - in notion of discreteness , but arises indirectly through the translation operator @xmath2 .",
    "various approaches to qtg ( such as lqg , string theory and non - commutative geometries ) suggest the existence of a minimum measurable length , or a maximum observable momentum @xcite . in pq",
    "a length scale is required for its construction , while for the gravitational case this is identified with planck length , in the mechanical case it is just a free parameter .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the physical consequences of the pq scheme in the dynamics of a well - known quantum transient phenomena : diffraction in time ( dit ) .",
    "dit was discussed first by moshinsky @xcite .",
    "it is a phenomenon associated with the quantum dynamics of suddenly released quantum particles initially confined in a region of space .",
    "the hallmark of dit consists of temporal and spatial oscillations of the quantum density profile @xcite .",
    "the basic results of moshinsky s shutter are reviewed in [ appa ] . in [ shutter ]",
    "we consider the shutter problem in the framework of polymer quantum mechanics . in [ p - s transition ]",
    "we show that the polymer result converges to the moshinsky result in the appropriate limit . in [ waveequation ]",
    "we demonstrate that no dit effect arises when the wave function satisfies the polymer wave equation . finally in [ discussion ]",
    "we briefly discuss the implementation of a lower bound to the possible resolution of times into the time - energy heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "the problem we shall discuss is the following : a monochromatic beam of polymer particles of mass @xmath3 and momentum @xmath4 , impinges on a totally absorber shutter located at the origin . if at @xmath5 the shutter is opened , what will be the transient polymer density profile at a distance @xmath6 from the shutter ?    to tackle this problem , we first restrict the dynamics to an equispaced lattice @xmath7 .",
    "the spectrum of the position operator @xmath8 consists of a countable selection of points from the real line , which is analogous to the graphs covering 3-manifolds in lqg .",
    "the polymer hilbert space @xmath9 , with @xmath10 corresponding haar measure , and @xmath11 the real line endowed with the discrete topology ] , consists of position wave functions which are nonzero only on the lattice , restricting the momentum wave functions to be periodic functions of period @xmath12 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath13 is regarded as a fundamental length scale of the polymer theory .",
    "[ for a simpler analysis of the problem , hereafter we use the following dimensionless quantities for position , momentum , energy and time , @xmath14 respectively .",
    "also we use the notation @xmath15 for the wave function in coordinate representation . ]    for ( non - relativistic ) polymer particles , the wave function @xmath16 that represents the state of the beam of polymer particles for @xmath17 , satisfies the time - dependent polymer schrdinger equation @xcite @xmath18 and the initial wave function @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the heaviside step function , and the momentum @xmath21 is a solution of the ( free ) polymer dispersion relation , @xmath22 , considering a fixed value of @xmath23 .",
    "note that the energy spectrum is bounded from above , and the bound depends on the length scale @xmath13 .",
    "for @xmath24 the shutter has been removed and the dynamics is free . by using the free polymer propagator @xcite , namely @xmath25 the solution of ( [ pol schr eq ] ) , subject to the initial condition ( [ in wave funct ] ) , is then @xmath26 where we have defined @xmath27 by using properties of bessel functions , one can further check that @xmath16 satisfies ( [ pol schr eq ] ) and the initial condition ( [ in wave funct ] ) .",
    "the corresponding polymer density profile , @xmath28 , \\label{polymer profile}\\ ] ] can not be reduced to a simple form but they can be treated numerically .",
    "plots of the polymer and the moshinsky density profiles for both , the low and the high energy regimes , are presented in [ dt(t)rho / small , dt(t)rho / big ] , respectively . at low energies ( @xmath29 )",
    "the polymer and standard cases behave qualitatively in a similar manner .",
    "however , at high energies the polymer distribution exhibits some differences with respect to the standard case .",
    "next we discuss the afore mentioned limiting cases .",
    "+    in [ dt(t)rho / smalla ] we plot the low energy polymer distribution as a function of time @xmath30 at a fixed distance @xmath6 .",
    "we observe that the polymer result exhibits small oscillations superimposed on the moshinsky result .",
    "this situation resembles the quantum - classical transition problem , where the classical distribution follows the spatial local average of the quantum probability density for large quantum numbers @xcite . in this framework",
    ", [ dt(t)rho / smalla ] suggests that the polymer and quantum - mechanical distributions approach each other in a locally time - averaged sense at low energies .    as in the standard case , a good measure of the width of the polymer diffraction effect in time ,",
    "can be obtained from the difference @xmath31 between the first two times at which @xmath32 takes the classical value @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 , as shown in [ dt(t)rho / smalla ] . in this case",
    "such time difference can be estimated the same way as in the quantum - mechanical case ( see [ appa ] ) because at first order of approximation , the low - energy polymer wave function converges to the moshinsky function evaluated on points in the lattice , i.e. @xmath35 ( see eq.([asymp mf ] ) ) . by using the cornu spiral one obtains @xmath36 , which leads to @xmath37 for @xmath38 .    in this framework ,",
    "the difference between both distributions , @xmath39 , represents a good measure of the residual polymer behaviour at quantum level .",
    "it would be interesting that such deviations could be detected with high sensitivity experiments , however at low energies @xmath40 is enough small ( of the order of @xmath41 , see eq.([asymp mf ] ) ) to be detected in lab .",
    "for example , for the case considered in [ dt(t)rho / smalla ] one obtains @xmath42 , moreover taking @xmath13 in the order of the planck length ( @xmath43 ) , such deviation is extremely small ( @xmath44 ) .    in [ dt(t)rho / smallb ]",
    "we present the low energy polymer density profile as a function of @xmath45 at a fixed time @xmath30 .",
    "as expected , we observe that the polymer result ( discrete blue plot ) resembles the standard result ( continuous red line ) as increasing @xmath45 , showing oscillations near the edge .",
    "the width of these oscillations can also be estimated the same way as in the standard case ( see [ appa ] ) . with the help of the cornu spiral one",
    "obtains @xmath46     +    the high energy polymer density profile as a function of time @xmath30 at fixed distance @xmath6 is presented in [ dt(t)rho / biga ] .",
    "clearly , this case does not admit a simple analysis in terms of the cornu spiral because the polymer distribution differs significatively with respect to the moshinsky result .",
    "however we can construct a parametric like - spiral to perform a similar analysis .",
    "the standing point is that the polymer distribution can be expressed as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 stands for the imaginary and real parts of the function @xmath50 ( [ parametric function ] ) , respectively .",
    "therefore we consider the curve that results from the parametric representation @xmath51 .    in the like - spiral diagram of [ spiral ] , the polymer probability density ( [ polymer profile ] )",
    "is the square of the radius vector from the origin @xmath52 to the point on the spiral whose distance from the origin , along the curve , is @xmath30 . for the case considered in [ dt(t)rho / biga ] ,",
    "when @xmath53 goes from @xmath54 to the classical time of flight @xmath55 , the polymer distribution increases very slowly from @xmath54 to @xmath56 .",
    "in other words , the classical time @xmath57 is very small for detecting time - diffracted polymer particles .",
    "the times at which the polymer distribution intersects the classical value @xmath58 , correspond to the values of @xmath30 obtained from the intersection of the like - spiral diagram with the circle of radius @xmath58 and center @xmath52 in [ spiral ] .",
    "the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the lenghts along the like - spiral from the origin to the points @xmath58 and @xmath61 in [ spiral ] , so that we have @xmath62 , in agreement with the presented in [ dt(t)rho / biga ] . of course , as increasing the energy the time width @xmath31 increases , but",
    "also the first time @xmath60 at which the polymer distribution takes the classical value .",
    "therefore high energy polymer particles also exhibit the diffraction effect in time , but with the characteristic times ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) increased . in the limiting case",
    "@xmath65 the time @xmath60 tends to infinite , and then the polymer particles ( with the maximum possible energy ) do not exhibit the diffraction effect in time . in the like - spiral diagram of [ spiral ] , this case looks as a dense spiral completely contained in the unit circle .    ]    in [ dt(x)rho / bigb ] we plot the high energy polymer distribution as a function of @xmath45 at a fixed time @xmath30 .",
    "we observe that the polymer distribution decreases abruptly before the particles reach the edge , and that the @xmath66 value is smaller than for low energy polymer particles .",
    "physically our results imply that the high energy polymer effects become important at short distances ( [ dt(x)rho / bigb ] ) and short times ( [ dt(t)rho / biga ] ) , as expected .",
    "it has been argued that if the lattice spacing @xmath13 is taken to be sufficiently small , the polymer formulation should reduce to the schrdinger representation @xcite .",
    "this is a delicate issue because @xmath13 is regarded as a nonzero fundamental length scale of the polymer theory , and it can not be removed when working in @xmath9 , no matter how small is @xmath13 .",
    "this is analogous to the quantum - classical transition problem through @xmath67 limit , because @xmath68 is a nonzero fundamental constant of the quantum theory @xcite .    to address the polymer - schrdinger transition",
    ", we consider the low energy regime of the polymer theory ( @xmath29 ) , that one expects to be the domain of validity of the schrdinger theory .",
    "clearly , the standard energy spectrum is recovered in the @xmath29 limit , @xmath69 but it remains bounded from above due to the nonzero @xmath13 . in terms of the de broglie wavelength @xmath70 , this limit can be expressed as @xmath71 , i.e. the fundamental length is very small compared with the characteristic quantum - mechanical length .",
    "taking @xmath13 in the order of the planck length , the typical diffraction experiments of electrons and neutrons , for which @xmath72 , strongly satisfy the required condition @xcite .",
    "physically the @xmath71 limit implies that we should take the number of points between two arbitrary points very large , but keeping fixed its distance .",
    "consequently for the distance between the shutter and the observer we must consider @xmath73 , and then the asymptotic behaviour of bessel functions for large indices in [ pwf ] is required . on the other hand ,",
    "the time needed for the particle to move from @xmath74 to @xmath75 with momentum @xmath1 is @xmath76 .",
    "then by keeping fixed the distance , the @xmath77 limit implies that @xmath78 , and therefore the asymptotic behaviour of ( [ pwf ] ) for large values of @xmath30 is also required .",
    "note that the argument of the bessel function grows faster than its order , so that the @xmath79 limit will dominate the transition @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic expansion of the bessel functions for large arguments is well known @xcite . it can be written as @xmath80 } } { \\sqrt{2 \\pi \\tau } } \\left\\lbrace r _ { \\nu } \\left ( \\tau \\right )    + r _ { \\nu } ^{\\ast}\\left ( \\tau \\right )   e ^{-2i \\left [ \\tau -\\frac{\\pi}{2 } \\left ( \\nu + \\frac{1}{2 } \\right )   \\right ] } \\right\\rbrace , \\label{asymp bessel}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 , with @xmath82    we observe that the expression ( [ asymp bessel ] ) depends on the order of the bessel function through both , the exponentials and the gamma functions in ( [ aux funct ] ) .",
    "fortunately only the second one becomes important for large indices @xmath83 . using the approximation @xmath84 for @xmath85 ,",
    "the function @xmath86 becomes @xmath87 finally the asymptotic behaviour of the bessel function @xmath88 , for large arguments ( @xmath79 ) and large orders ( @xmath85 ) , yields @xmath89 one can further check that in this regime the term proportional to @xmath90 makes no contribution to the asymptotic behaviour because it produces a distributional expression , as pointed out in ref.@xcite .    substituting ( [ asymp bessel 1 ] ) in ( [ pwf ] ) we get a discrete version of the moshinsky function , @xmath91 which satisfies analogous properties @xcite , i.e.    * under inversion of both @xmath6 and @xmath1 , it satisfies @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the jacobi s elliptic theta function @xcite , * the asymptotic behaviour for @xmath94 and @xmath95 is @xmath96 which is the standard quantum - mechanical result : a plane wave traveling to the right with momentum @xmath1 and energy @xmath97 , * it satisfies the polymer schrdinger equation ( [ pol schr eq ] ) .    to illuminate the correpondence between @xmath98 and the moshinsky function ( [ moshinsky ] ) in a clear fashion , we first approximate the sum in ( [ parametric function ] ) by using the euler - maclaurin formula , @xmath99 where we have used that @xmath100 as @xmath101",
    "now , by the use of the asymptotic expansion of bessel functions ( [ asymp bessel 1 ] ) we obtain @xmath102 + i \\left [   \\frac{1}{2 } + s \\left ( \\xi \\right ) \\right ]   \\right\\rbrace   \\\\",
    "\\nonumber   & & + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8 \\pi \\tau } } e ^{-i \\left ( \\frac{\\pi}{4 } + \\frac{\\mu ^{2}}{2 \\tau } \\right ) } \\label{asymp mf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 .",
    "we recognize the first term in ( [ asymp mf ] ) as the moshinsky function ( independent of @xmath13 ) evaluated on points in the lattice , i.e. @xmath104 . the second term is small because it depends on @xmath105 but it is nonzero .",
    "of course this additional term represents the polymer residual behaviour at quantum level .",
    "then at low energies we can neglect the correction term to analyze the polymer behaviour by using the cornu spiral .",
    "moshinsky also analyzed the shutter problem for different wave equations .",
    "the result was that no dit phenomenon arises for the ordinary wave equation and the klein - gordon equation @xcite .",
    "of course this fact is intimately connected with the similarities between the sommerfeld s diffraction theory and the time - dependent schrdinger equation .    in this section",
    "we shall consider the shutter problem , but assume that the state @xmath106 satisfies the polymer wave equation @xmath107 where @xmath108 , and @xmath109 is the speed of light .",
    "of course , we do not expect some resemblance between the solutions of ( [ pol wavr eq ] ) and ( [ pol schr eq ] ) .",
    "as usual , we will consider that initially @xmath110 and its time derivative are given by @xmath111 and then the solution of ( [ pol wavr eq ] ) can be obtained by using the fourier integral theorem , i.e. @xmath112 , \\label{fourier integral}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the fourier transforms of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "for @xmath118 the shutter was closed , and then we had on the left side of the shutter the simple ( truncated ) plane wave solution @xmath119 this implies that at @xmath120 we have : @xmath121 while @xmath122 for @xmath123 .    by fourier transforming ( [ in cond we ] ) we obtain that the initial conditions in the fourier space become @xmath124 these formulas are derived in [ in cond four space ] .",
    "we observe that in the low energy regime @xmath113 reduces to the @xmath125 function .    substituting ( [ in cond we mom ] ) in ( [",

    "the integrand of ( [ wave ] ) has two simple poles at @xmath129 and an essential singularity at @xmath130 , but the principal value of the integral is convergent . in [ integral ]",
    "we evaluate it .",
    "the result is @xmath131 , \\label{sol wave}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath132 are the bessel functions of first kind and @xmath133 are the gauss hypergeometric funtions in the unit circle .",
    "it is clear that , for @xmath134 and @xmath135 fixed , this function oscillates peridiocally in time .",
    "this behaviour has certainly no resemblance to the dit effect obtained in [ shutter ] .",
    "the implications of the introduction of a nonzero fundamental length scale in quantum theory are quite profund .",
    "for example , the heisenberg theorem , one of the cornerstones of quantum mechanics , states that the position @xmath136 and momentum @xmath1 of a particle can not be simultaneously known with arbitrary precision , but the indeterminacies of a joint measurement are always bounded by @xmath137 .",
    "the implementation of such minimal length in quantum theory introduces a lower bound to the possible resolution of distances .",
    "it has therefore been suggested that the heisenberg uncertainty relations should be modified to take into account the effects of spatial  grainy \" structure @xcite .",
    "the implementation of such ideas in polymer quantum mechanics is a difficult task because the momentum operator is not directly realized as in schrdinger quantum mechanics , furthermore the minimum length introduces an upper bound for momentum . in this framework ,",
    "gup theories predicts both a minimal observable length and a maximal momentum in the modified relation @xmath138 $ ] , with @xmath139 .",
    "it is well known that ordinary diffraction phenomena for beams of particles are closely associated with the position - momentum uncertainty relation , and the appearence of diffraction in time effects are closely connected with the time - energy uncertainty relation @xmath140 .",
    "the possibility of closing the shutter after a time @xmath141 have been used to form a pulse . for small values of @xmath141",
    "the time - energy uncertainty relation comes into play , broadening the energy distribution of the resulting pulse @xcite . in the problem at hand ,",
    "the lower bound to the possible resolution of distances introduces a minimal temporal window for the formation of a pulse of polymer particles .",
    "therefore we suggest that also the time - energy uncertainty relation must be modified to implement the nonzero minimal uncertainty in time @xmath142 .",
    "the simplest generalized time - energy uncertainty relation which imples the appearance of a nonzero minimal uncertainty in time has de form @xmath143 $ ] , where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are positive and independent of @xmath146 and @xmath141 .",
    "possible extensions of this work include more complicated ( time - dependent ) shutter windows and the formation of polymer pulses .",
    "these could shed light on how we should modify the time - energy uncertainty relation to take into account the lower and upper bounds for the uncertainties in time and energy , respectively .",
    "the implementation of both , the position - momentum and the time - energy modified uncertainty relations , could play an important role in other branches of physics .",
    "for example in the framework of local quantum field theories , the reason why we have ultraviolet divergencies is that in short time region @xmath147 , the uncertainty with respect to energy increases indefinitely @xmath148 , which in turn induces a large uncertainty in momentum @xmath149 .",
    "the large uncertainty in momentum means that the particles states allowed in the short distance region @xmath150 grows indefinitely as @xmath151 in @xmath152-dimensional space - time @xcite . in these theories",
    "where there is no cutoff built - in , all those states are expected to contribute to amplitudes with equal strength and consequently lead to uv infinities .",
    "a theory which naturally provides the adequate modified uncertainty relations could shed light on the route for curing such uv divergences .",
    "finally , let us summarize our results .",
    "in [ shutter ] we study the quantum dynamics of a suddenly released beam of polymer particles for both , the low and high energy regimes .",
    "our numerical results show that in the quantum domain , the polymer distribution ( as a function of time ) exhibits small oscillations superimposed on the quantum - mechanical result ( [ dt(t)rho / smalla ] ) .",
    "also the discrete spatial behaviour resembles the standard result for long distances , as shown in [ dt(t)rho / smallb ] . in [ p - s transition ]",
    "we show in an analytical clear fashion that in the first order of approximation the low energy polymer density profile converges to the monshinsky distribution , but also emerges an additional polymer correction term , responsible of the small temporal and spatial deviations in [ dt(t)rho / small ] . at high energies the diffraction effect in time also takes place , but only for long times ( see [ dt(t)rho / biga ] ) . for polymer particles with the maximum possible",
    "energy the dit is not longer present .",
    "regarding to the spatial behaviour , the polymer distribution decreases abruptly before the particles reach the edge , as shown in [ dt(x)rho / bigb ] . as expected , the polymer effects become important at short distances and short times . on the other hand",
    "we find that no diffraction effect in time arises when the wave functions satisfies the polymer wave equation .",
    "in the original moshinsky s setup @xcite , a quasi - monochromatic beam of non - relativistic quantum particles of momentum @xmath1 is incident upon a perfectly absorbing shutter located at the origin and perpendicular to the beam .",
    "if the shutter is suddenly removed at @xmath5 , what will be the transient density profile at a distance @xmath136 from the shutter ?",
    "the initial wave function that we shall consider is @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the heaviside step function . note that the state is not really monochromatic due the spatial truncation , besides that is clearly not normalized .",
    "since for @xmath155 the shutter has been removed , the dynamics is free and the time - evolved wave function is @xmath156 with the free propagator @xmath157    the solution of ( [ wave function ] ) with the initial wave function ( [ initial wf ] ) is known as moshinsky functions , @xmath158 + i \\left [   \\frac{1}{2 } + s \\left (   \\xi \\right ) \\right ]   \\right\\rbrace , \\label{moshinsky}\\ ] ] where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the fresnel integrals @xcite , and @xmath161 .",
    "the `` diffraction in time '' term was introduced because the temporal behaviour of the quantum density profile ( [ dt - time ] ) , @xmath162 ^{2 } + \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } + s\\left ( \\xi \\right )   \\right ] ^{2 } \\right\\rbrace ,   \\label{quantum profile}\\ ] ] admits a simple geometric interpretation in terms of cornu spiral or clothoid , which is the curve that results from a parametric representation of the fresnel integrals ( [ cornu ] ) .",
    "this is precisely the form of the intensity profile of a light beam diffracted by a semi - infinite plane @xcite , which prompted the choice of the dit term .",
    "the probability density is one - half of the square of the distance from the point @xmath163 to any other point of the cornu spiral . in such representation",
