    "lyman limit systems ( hereafter lls ) are detected as intergalactic clouds which absorb the quasar radiation at energies above the ionization edge of neutral atomic hydrogen .",
    "the optical depth to the continuum radiation at the lyman edge is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the hi column density along the line of sight . for @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath17 can be measured accurately regardless of the velocity structure of multiple components ; for @xmath19 the absorption can be detected , although @xmath17 can not be measured .",
    "we shall not analyze in detail the lyman-@xmath0 forest systems , at much smaller @xmath17 , but will consider the whole range of column densities from the lls to the , mostly neutral , damped lyman-@xmath0 systems ( hereafter dls ) with much larger @xmath17 .",
    "we will then discuss a possible extrapolation of our results towards the lyman-@xmath0 forest region .",
    "there have been some suggestions that lls , as well as mgii absorbers with similar hi column densities , may be related to outskirts of galaxies @xcite while dls are more likely to originate from their inner regions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we shall show that , whether this suggestion is verified or not , the ratio of the total to neutral hydrogen column density for typical lls can be estimated assuming only that the total gas column density distribution @xmath20 is a smoothly varying function from lls to dls range . in particular we shall derive a value for @xmath6 , the logarithm of @xmath21 for a line of sight value of @xmath22 , at intermediate redshifts , namely @xmath23 .",
    "from @xmath6 we shall derive @xmath0 , the exponent in the power law for @xmath24 .",
    "if the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 is very large , the ionization fraction changes rapidly and the value of @xmath17 can increase from @xmath25 @xmath26 to @xmath27 @xmath26 over a fairly small increase of the total column density .",
    "breaks have been found in the distribution of @xmath17 of absorbers from the lyman-@xmath0 forest to the dls @xcite .",
    "we shall show that this behavior of @xmath17 is compatible with a single power law distribution for the total hydrogen column density , once the change in ionization fraction is taken into account .",
    "in fact it is the change in slope of the @xmath17 distribution from the lls to dls region which enables us to derive a value for @xmath6 .",
    "a similar phenomenon is found in the outskirts of today s galaxies where a sharp decline of the hi column density over a narrow range of the galaxy radius occurs .",
    "one can explain this occurrence in term of an hi - hii transition zone which takes place when the column density gets sufficiently low that the gas becomes optically thin to the extragalactic ionizing flux . for todays galaxies",
    "the known rotational velocity constrains the dark matter content which , together with the measured radial decline of the hi column density at the hi - hii transition zone , can be used to estimate the uv ionizing flux at @xmath28 , otherwise unobservable . @xcite",
    "have in fact modeled the sharp hi decline observed in m33 by considering a total gas distribution compressed by the local dark matter ( inferred from the observed rotational velocities ) , and irradiated by the extragalactic uv and soft x - ray background .",
    "they found a best fit to the observed hi radial distribution in the outermost disk and to its sharp decline when the intensity of the background radiation at the lyman - edge is @xmath29 ergs @xmath26 s@xmath30 sr@xmath30 .",
    "for lls the situation is reversed since the metagalactic ionizing flux at high @xmath31 is better known than the dark matter content of absorbers : from @xmath6 we shall derive the volume gas density @xmath32 , which is larger than self - gravity alone can produce and therefore gives information on the dark matter gravitational potential .",
    "unfortunately the difficulty in measuring the residual flux of lls at large optical depths limits the determination of the hi column density of the absorber above @xmath33 @xmath26 . for this reason",
    "we are forced to introduce a new technique for treating large uncertainties in the @xmath17 values . in the construction of a database for lls",
    "we include also the high column density systems , known as damped absorbers , whose column density is determined from the scatter of the lyman-@xmath0 radiation .",
    "both the database and the data treatment are described in detail in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) . in section 2 of this paper",
    "we derive the number density of lls and dls from our database and in section 3 we describe radiative transfer processes and the gas stratification model for the gas in lls and dls .",
    "the power law distribution for the total hydrogen column density and the h fractional ionizations which fit at best the data at @xmath34 in the lyman - limit and damped lyman-@xmath0 region will be derived in section 4 .",
    "having the h ionization fractions for lls , we can then compute the total gas content of lls and dls and estimate their dark matter potential .",
    "also given in section 4 is an extrapolation of our fit towards absorption systems of even lower hi column density .",
    "from the available literature we have collected data on lls with @xmath35 and on dls with rest frame equivalent width @xmath36  for @xmath37 . we have 661 qsos and for each qso we have the redshift path covered with a given sensitivity , the redshift of the intervening absorbers and their estimated hi column density , @xmath17 .",
    "we disregard absorbers and paths within 5000 km / s from the quasar redshift .",
    "the sensitivity of a search is expressed as a lower limit to the hi column densities searched . to a given direction",
    "it may correspond more than one path if different redshift paths were searched with different sensitivities .",
    "if no estimates of the absorbers hi column density are available ( if no residual flux is detected short ward of the lyman break for example ) a lower limit to it is given while upper limits may be derived from searches of damped lyman-@xmath0 absorption lines .",
    "the hi column density values obtained from voigt profile fits , when these are available , are included in our database .",
    "a comparison of the hi column densities derived directly from the equivalent width , with those determined from the voigt profile fit to the same absorption lines shows that the voigt fit procedure gives a systematically higher value of @xmath17 .",
    "this might be due to an underestimate of the equivalent width due to an effective absorption of the quasar continuum radiation by intervening forest clouds . using data where voigt fits are available we derive an average correction for @xmath38 , the column density derived from @xmath39 , and we correct the data whenever no voigt fits are available as follows :    @xmath40    since the maximum dispersion found in the data used for deriving eq .",

    "the lls sample consists of all observations which were sensitive to lls with @xmath43 .",
    "the dls sample consists of observations sensitive to absorbers with column density log@xmath44 .",
    "we wish to examine the number density of absorbers per unit redshift , @xmath45 in the lls and dls sample . as usual",
    "we represent the number density as a power law of the form    @xmath46    in order to avoid binning the data in redshift intervals , which can generate errors in the estimate of the evolutionary trend , we use the maximum likelihood method described by @xcite to estimate @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for the lls sample the maximum value of the likelihood is found for :    @xmath49    where the errors quoted are the @xmath50 confidence limits .",
    "the @xmath51 confidence limits for @xmath48 are 0.80 and 2.64 .",
    "these values are similar to the ones obtained by @xcite , for the dls sample we find    @xmath52    the @xmath53 confidence limits are 0.11 and 1.72 .",
    "the value of @xmath48 is consistent but slightly lower than what has been found by @xcite for higher column density systems .",
    "if we restrict our dls sample to only those systems with have a measured log@xmath54 we obtain the same values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 as given by @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the cumulative number of absorbers versus @xmath31 for both samples . over plotted",
    "is the expected number of lls and dls from the maximum likelihood estimate .",
    "notice that dls at @xmath55 seem to require a lower value of @xmath48 than what is given by the maximum likelihood estimate over the whole @xmath31 range .",
    "in fact by considering only redshifts @xmath55 the match between the data and the best fit cumulative function for dls improves : in this case @xmath56 with @xmath57 and 1.36 as @xmath53 confidence limits .",
    "for the present paper we shall use data only in the intermediate redshift range @xmath58 and for this range the slight difference in evolution implied by eq .",
    "( [ gamlls ] ) and ( [ gamdls ] ) is unimportant .",
    "we use an average @xmath48 value of 1.0 which is consistent both with the number density evolution of dls and of lls .",

    "although our likelihood analysis allows power law indices @xmath0 in a rather wide range , 2 to 3.7 , other arguments make the upper half of this range more likely : @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 . for larger values of @xmath11",
    "the gas scale height @xmath184 for dls is uncomfortably small and the lls contribution @xmath196 to cosmological matter density is uncomfortably large ( see table 1 , the @xmath197 values given are for @xmath164 ; @xmath197 values for @xmath198 and @xmath167 are larger by a factor @xmath199 ) . for the total dark matter",
    "mass , the factor @xmath178 for @xmath177 is of order @xmath200 km s@xmath30 , which suggests @xmath201 km s@xmath30 on average for lls and dls at redshifts @xmath15 .",
    "this finding is in agreement with the rotational velocities of absorbers halos predicted by @xcite and with models that propose that a large fraction of lyman-@xmath0 absorption systems originate from small low luminosity systems @xcite .",
    "however @xcite have shown that small rotational velocities are not required by low redshifts mgii absorption systems with @xmath202  .",
    "these have the same average density per unit path of redshift as lls and seem to be associated with normal galaxies whose halo extends for @xmath203 kpc .",
    "this opens the issue about possible evolutionary scenarios for lls , which can be fully addressed only once we know the redshift evolution of galactic halos and of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the possible role of faint galaxies as those in pairs close to bright galaxies @xcite should also be taken into account .",
    "futhermore it would be extremely useful to have a larger statistical sample of lls and dls at @xmath204 and at @xmath205 which , together with a better knowledge of the evolution of the background ionizing radiation field , allows a determination of @xmath0 and @xmath78 at these redshifts ( see paper ii for an attempt with the actual data set ) .",
    "@xmath185 although lyman-@xmath0 forest clouds , with their much smaller column density , might be physically different and have different values of @xmath0 and @xmath11 , extrapolations using constant @xmath0 and @xmath11 values as for lls and dls give surprisingly good fits .",
    "we can not make definitive statements about the low density lyman-@xmath0 forest clouds because of possible dynamic deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium and possible pressure confinement .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that @xmath0 is appreciably larger than 2 near lls for @xmath15 suggests that forest clouds contained more gas than lls , which in turn contained more gas than dls .",
    "several papers have shown that the gas content in dls at @xmath15 is below the mass content in galaxies in the local universe @xcite , @xmath206 and that the stellar mass density in stellar systems at @xmath15 is very small @xcite .",
    "it is therefore likely that gas in forest clouds and lls at @xmath15 has collapsed and contributed to stars in present day galaxies .",
    "we are grateful to p. madau for providing us numerical results on the background radiation field , to the referee and to dr .",
