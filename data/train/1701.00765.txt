    "we consider a network composed of 1280 neurons , 80% of which are excitatory while the remaining 20% are inhibitory @xcite .",
    "the neurons , modeled as described in suppl .",
    "section s1 , were arranged in two open one - dimensional chains , one for the excitatory population and the other one for the inhibitory population , with one inhibitory neuron placed every four adjacent excitatory neurons .",
    "all connections between cells are chemical synapses no gap junctions are considered , and each neuron connects with 20@xmath85 other neurons .",
    "the two chains are 5  mm long , with no empty space between adjacent neurons .",
    "we use the coupling architecture introduced by @xcite , in which the probability that two neurons are connected is determined by the distance _ x _ between them , according to a gaussian probability distribution @xmath9 , with no autapses being allowed . the standard deviation @xmath10",
    "is set to 250  @xmath11 m for the excitatory connections , and 125  @xmath11 m for the inhibitory connections . as a reference",
    ", the size of an excitatory neuron can be considered @xmath125  @xmath11 m ( 50  times smaller than its @xmath10 ) and that of an inhibitory neuron @xmath1219  @xmath11 m ( about 13  times smaller than its @xmath10 ) .",
    "the neurons are also driven by random spike trains drawn from a poisson distribution , representing the effect of neurons that are not included explicitly in the network .",
    "experimentally , this random input corresponds to fluctuations in the excitability of neurons neighboring the area where the slow oscillation is taking place .",
    "the local field potential ( lfp ) is computed as the sum of the absolute values of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents acting upon the excitatory neurons @xcite : @xmath13 the terms @xmath14 and @xmath15 account for both the external excitatory heterogeneous poisson spike train and the recurrent excitatory synaptic current due to network connectivity , respectively . in turn",
    ", @xmath16 corresponds to the recurrent inhibitory synaptic current .",
    "@xmath17 represents the resistance of a typical electrode used for extracellular measurements , here chosen to be 1  m@xmath18 .",
    "the lfp is sampled at 1  khz .",
    "the initiation and termination of the up and down states were identified by means of the log(mua ) , a measure extracted from the power spectrum of the lfp [ equation  ( [ eq : appendix_lfpdef ] ) ] within the frequency range 0.20.5  khz ( see next section for a complete description ) .",
    "the multiunit activity ( mua ) is estimated as the power change in the fourier components of the recorded ( or simulated ) lfp at high frequencies .",
    "the time - dependent mua is computed from the power spectrum in 50-ms windows , each frequency normalized by the corresponding amplitude of the power spectrum computed over the whole time series , and averaged within the 0.21.5  khz band ( 0.20.5  khz in the simulations , except in supp .",
    "s1b , where the range 0.10.5  khz was used ) .",
    "the mua signal is then logarithmically scaled and smoothed by a moving average with a sliding window of 80  ms @xcite .",
    "the up and down states were singled out by setting a threshold in the log(mua ) signal .",
    "the threshold was set between peaks of the bimodal distributions of log(mua ) , corresponding to the up and down states .",
    "the peak related to the down state was used as reference , setting there log(mua ) = 0 . the z - score of the log(mua )",
    "is computed by subtracting from each sd curve its mean value for all simulations / experiments across the extracellular potassium range , normalizing it by its standard deviation , and averaging the results across replicates .      in order to quantify the regularity of the up waves we proceed as follows .",
    "first , after detection of every up state , we compute the times at which each electrode crosses a given threshold ( as mentioned in the section above ) .",
    "the electrodes whose signal is very noisy are not used for the analysis . on the other hand , we consider only those up states that are detected in all three columns in which the array is arranged ( see fig .",
    "5aa , b ) but not necessarily in all the electrodes in each column. this condition enables us to consider those waves that propagate through all three columns across the slice .",
    "we transform those first - passage times into time lags by subtracting the initial time at which the up wave is first detected somewhere within the array .",
    "if one of the propagating up states is not detected in one of the electrodes used for the analysis , we assign to that electrode for that particular wave a time lag that is an average from other time lags belonging to the 5 most similar propagating wavefronts .",
    "next we interpolate the time lags using a thin - plate spline by means of the matlab function tpaps . the new data points form a grid of 105@xmath1949 points .",
    "hence we have as many grids as detected up states .",
    "each grid is further subdivided into a coarse matrix of 15@xmath197 cells .",
    "we then compute the correlation between each one of these cells with the equivalent cell belonging to the other detected up waves .",
    "therefore , the correlation between two up waves leads to 105 ( @xmath20 ) correlation coefficients , and the correlation between @xmath21 up waves leads to @xmath22 coefficients .",
    "finally , we compute the spatial consistency ( sc ) of the wavefronts in terms of the percentage of highly correlated matrix elements ( @xmath23 ) between all wave pairs for each of the cells .",
    "the color maps in fig .",
    "5b represent the spatial consistency for all cells in the @xmath24 coarse matrix .",
    "the same approach is followed in our one - dimensional model , where the time lags are obtained from 16 clusters of consecutive excitatory neurons covering the entire one - dimensional model network , while an interpolation is performed to generate a vector of 49 cells .",

    "<S> when the network nodes are threshold elements , a sufficiently large background noise will render their activity stochastic . </S>",
    "<S> yet , the collective behavior of the network is frequently highly regular in time . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the question of how the stochastic nature of the network elements coexists with the quasi - deterministic character of the collective dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> while coupling has long been proposed as a regularizing mechanism for interacting sloppy oscillators @xcite , the situation is much less clear when the individual elements are not intrinsic oscillators , but exhibit noise - driven pulsatile dynamics , such as in excitable elements . </S>",
    "<S> a relevant instance of this situation is given by neuronal networks .    </S>",
    "<S> here we study the interplay between noise and collective dynamics in networks of neurons from the cerebral cortex operating in the state of slow oscillations , a dynamical regime that has been suggested as the default activity of the cortex @xcite . in this physiological state , </S>",
    "<S> typical of slow wave sleep and anesthesia @xcite , the membrane potential of cortical neurons alternates at frequencies of the order of 1  hz between the so - called up and down states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> up states are characterized by a depolarization of the membrane voltage towards the spiking threshold and a sustained firing activity of the neurons , similar to their dynamics during wakefulness . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the down states neurons are mostly silent and exhibit a hyperpolarized membrane voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that up and down states exist spontaneously _ in vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in the absence of external stimulation , suggests that this dynamical regime is self - sustained , appearing locally without requiring large - scale cortical interactions nor external inputs . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the recurrent connectivity between neurons is sufficient for the emergence of these slow oscillations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we examine the recurrent network dynamics exhibited _ in vitro _ by slices of the ferret cerebral cortex . in our experiments , </S>",
    "<S> noise is determined by the level of neuronal excitability , which can be controlled by the extracellular potassium concentration in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous studies @xcite , no external time - dependent signals are applied to the system , which operates spontaneously in a regime very close to what is observed _ in vivo _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the regularity of the slow oscillations decreases when the brain comes out of deep anaesthesia @xcite , anticipating the loss of the slow oscillatory regime and the emergence of the sustained depolarized state characteristic of wakefulness @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretical work has shown that the sequence of up and down states can be highly irregular in the presence of noisy inputs provided inhibition is decreased @xcite , for low ampa conductances of the connections between pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons @xcite , or more generally by changing the stability balance between metastable up and down attractors , for instance through modulation of the fatigue- and adaptation - dependent inhibitory feedback @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the more regular regime characteristic of the sleep state is , however , still under debate . </S>",
    "<S> is it a deterministic or a noise - driven state ? here we explore the latter possibility in an isolated network of the cerebral cortex . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the cortical network generates slow oscillations that exhibit maximal regularity for an intermediate amount of background synaptic noise , in what can be construed as an instance of stochastic coherence .    in generic ( uncoupled ) excitable systems , </S>",
    "<S> stochastic coherence arises from the fact that the entry into the excited state is noise - driven , whereas the exit is basically controlled by deterministic processes and is followed by a refractory period , after which no reinitiation is possible for a certain time window under moderate noise @xcite . in those conditions </S>",
    "<S> , increasing noise leads to more frequent initiations that eventually pile up at the refractory period with strong regularity , while for larger noise refractoriness breaks down and the dynamics becomes irregular again . here </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that up / down oscillations exhibit this behavior , motivated by the realization that the neuronal networks underlying the phenomenon exhibit the above - mentioned three main requirements of stochastic coherence ( stochastic initiation , deterministic termination , and refractoriness ) at the collective level .    </S>",
    "<S> first , the initiation of the up state is triggered by the spontaneous ( noise - driven ) simultaneous firing of a few excitatory neurons . </S>",
    "<S> second , the termination of the up state can be explained by an accumulation of adaptation during the up state , which can be expected to be mainly deterministic @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from the up to the down state can be accounted for by the activity - dependent adaptation of neurons caused by the activation of potassium channels that reduce the sensitivity to synaptic inputs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a cumulative processes driven by the high ( and well - defined ) firing rate characteristic of the up regime , and is thus essentially deterministic . </S>",
    "<S> other cumulative mechanisms for up - state termination have been proposed , including synapse fatigue caused by depression @xcite , but they are also mostly independent of noise at the network level . importantly , all these mechanisms require a recovery of the network excitability following the up state , leading to refractoriness @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we thus propose that stochastic coherence provides a mechanism by which the natural excitability of the cortex determines the regularity of the up / down dynamics , by controlling the amount of background synaptic noise acting upon the neurons . in that way , </S>",
    "<S> an intermediate level of excitability which coincides with physiological conditions @xcite would lead to maximally coherent slow oscillations . in that scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the variations in regularity that are characteristic of sleep - to - wake transitions @xcite would arise from regulated changes in cortical excitability . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with previous studies of stochastic coherence at the level of individual neurons @xcite , the stochastic coherence reported here is a purely collective phenomenon , since both the initiation and the termination of the up states arise only at the network level ( initiation resulting from recurrent activation , and termination emerging from potassium channel - mediated adaptation , which only comes into effect during network - driven , high - frequency up state activity ) .      </S>",
    "<S> following compte et al @xcite , we consider a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons described by conductance - based models ( see online methods for a full description ) . </S>",
    "<S> network clustering enables recurrence of neuronal activity , through which randomly occurring spikes lead to a cascade of neuronal firing events ( up state ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : moddyn]a , which depicts the typical dynamics of two neurons from the network , one excitatory and the other one inhibitory . </S>",
    "<S> the up state terminates mainly via a potassium channel dependent on the intracellular sodium concentration , @xmath0 , which is known to be expressed throughout the brain @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an increase in the sodium concentration due to the enhancement of the firing activity of the cell during the up state activates this adaptive current , which in turn renders the neuron insensitive to upcoming presynaptic action potentials @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : moddyn]a are driven by background synaptic activity impinging stochastically on each neuron , coming from their presynaptic neighbors . the main way in which this background synaptic noise can vary is through changes in the excitability of the local network . </S>",
    "<S> to modify the excitability ( ignoring external inputs ) and thus change the background synaptic noise , we varied the resting membrane potential of all neurons by acting upon the equilibrium potential of potassium , which plays the largest role in establishing the neuron s resting potential . </S>",
    "<S> this can be replicated experimentally by modifying the concentration of potassium in the extracellular medium , [ k@xmath1@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , recordings performed in cats during transitions from slow - wave to rem sleep showed an enhancement of [ k@xmath1@xmath2 @xcite , suggesting its influence in neuronal excitability and network dynamics . in our model </S>",

    "<S> this activity is estimated by the log(mua ) , which is known to correlate with spiking activity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> variability in this quantity during the down states can thus be associated with background synaptic noise . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the standard deviation of the log(mua ) during the down states as a function of [ k@xmath1@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the result , shown in fig .  [ fig : moddyn]c , reveals a clear increase of the standard deviation as the extracellular potassium level grows ( with a high linear correlation , @xmath3 , and low p - value ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus identify the excitability , controlled by [ k@xmath1@xmath2 , with the noise acting upon the network .    </S>",

    "<S> the figure depicts the temporal evolution of the membrane potential of a representative neuron of the model network for three different values of the extracellular potassium concentration . for low [ k@xmath1@xmath2 ( top panel ) </S>",
    "<S> the excitability level is small , and consequently the initiation of up states is infrequent . as the excitability increases ( middle and bottom panels of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : stcoh_mod]a ) the up events become more frequent , due to higher noise levels , and the firing rate during the up state also increases ( in agreement with fig .  [ fig : moddyn]b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we next examine how the variability of the oscillatory dynamics depends on noise ( excitability ) , by computing the coefficient of variation of the durations of the up and down events . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : stcoh_mod]b , for low excitability levels the variability of the up phase duration is basically constant , in agreement with our assumption that termination is essentially deterministic unless noise is too large . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : memory],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the wavefronts are shown as contour plots computed over the spike - time histograms of groups of 40 consecutive neurons spanning the entire array . </S>",
    "<S> these plots suggest that the propagation of up states is rather irregular for both low and high excitability ( noise ) , whereas it follows a well - defined spatial pattern with clear initiation sites for intermediate noise levels . </S>",
    "<S> this is quantified in terms of the spatial consistency ( sc ) of the up wavefronts , which is inversely related to the amount of spatial dispersion among the wavefronts shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> therefore , our model predicts the existence of noise - induced spatial memory in the propagation of up states for intermediate levels of background synaptic noise , which concurs with the regularity of the collective dynamics .    to verify this theoretical prediction , we measured the electrical activity of cortical slices with the electrode array shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the plot reveals that the up wavefronts follow more regular patterns of propagation ( dark red areas ) for an intermediate excitability level , as predicted by our computational model . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of this spatial consistency for increasing extracellular potassium levels is negatively correlated with the temporal dispersion ( coefficient of variation ) of the up / down cycle durations , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : memory_exp]c , in agreement with the theoretical prediction . an analysis of the statistical significance of the curves shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : memory_exp]c using mixed - effects modeling @xcite allows us to reject the null hypothesis that potassium does not affect neither cv ( @xmath6 ) nor sc ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this supports our conclusion that potassium affects both the temporal and the spatial dispersion of the up / down dynamics .      </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that excitable systems ( of which neurons are an example ) can tune noise to enhance the regularity of their pulsing dynamics @xcite at a characteristic timescale that is intrinsic to the system @xcite , instead of being imposed externally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect has been observed in single neurons @xcite and in the somatosensory pathway of anesthetized cats @xcite in response to _ ad hoc _ noisy inputs . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to these works , here we have studied a purely cortical _ in vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> system under the influence of its own intrinsic noise , operating in a dynamic regime of slow oscillations that mimic those during slow wave sleep and anesthesia . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal that an intermediate amount of background noise maximize the regularity of the up / down cycle . modulating </S>",
    "<S> the regularity of these slow oscillations , which are an emerging property of the network , could facilitate the control of cortical information processing , by enabling mechanisms such as communication through coherence @xcite , or in general any mechanism that requires a periodic information carrier . differently from other studies @xcite </S>",
    "<S> that consider a white noise added to the membrane voltage , in our model the source of noise arises within the network , in the form of irregular presynaptic spike trains affecting all neurons of the network and coming from neighboring areas . </S>",
    "<S> this noise can be tuned experimentally via the membrane excitability of the individual neurons , determined by the potassium concentration [ k@xmath1@xmath2 in the extracellular medium . in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> , population activity appears as a collective phenomenon that underlies the control of rhythmicity .    both the network model and the experimental recordings confirm that slow up / down rhythms are modulated by random fluctuations , and achieve a maximum periodicity at an intermediate amplitude of those fluctuations . at low excitability levels </S>",
    "<S> the probability of eliciting an up state is low , and the occurrence of these events fluctuates strongly on time , giving rise to high variability in the durations of the down states . on the other hand , for high levels of excitability the refractory period can be overcome more easily ( i.e. the system is re - excited sooner following the up termination ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the behavior observed in the transition from sleep to awake , or from deep to light anaesthesia @xcite , where the up / down transitions become more frequent and irregular . between the two extremes , </S>",
    "<S> the up states are consistently evoked at a similar phase of the down state , and a recurrent collective period emerges . </S>",
    "<S> the specifics of this regular up / down regime depend on the balance between recurrent excitation and inhibition .    </S>",
    "<S> these results shed light on the self - regulation of cortical dynamics across different states of excitability , and reveal the existence of a regime of collective stochastic coherence leading to a maximal regularity of the dynamics for intermediate excitability . </S>",
    "<S> this is an emerging behavior reminiscent of the phenomenon of coherence resonance , which has been reported in a large variety of physical and chemical excitable systems over the years @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with those previous studies , however , the effect described here is an emerging property of the network , arising from the collective interaction between the neurons . </S>",
    "<S> given the stochastic and intrinsically emerging character of brain function , our results might be evidence of the functional benefits of noise in the activity of the central nervous system .      </S>",
