    "the transient x - ray binary  is the first accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar ( amxp ) discovered @xcite among the 14 systems currently known .",
    "it is also the best sampled amxp thanks to its relatively short recurrence time ( 1.6 - 3.3 yr ) and the continuous coverage of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _  ) which has extensively monitored all outbursts since 1998 .",
    "the presence of pulsations reveal the spin of the accreting pulsar ( @xmath3 ) and allow the study of torques that act upon the neutron star .",
    "this is particularly valuable because the spin evolution reveals details of the recycling mechanism that transforms a newly born slowly rotating neutron star into a millisecond pulsar via accretion @xcite . in our previous works ( @xcite ) we reported upper limits on the spin - up of the pulsar due to accretion torques ( during outbursts ) with a pulsar spin frequency derivative of @xmath4 .",
    "this value is smaller than predicted by accretion theory ( @xcite ) if the spin frequency of sax j1808.4 - 3658 substantially differs from the equilibrium spin frequency at the accretion rate close to the peak of the outburst .",
    "the long term spin evolution of the pulsar reveals a constant spin - down of magnitude @xmath5 possibly due to magnetic - dipole radiation acting during quiescence , for a surface magnetic field of the pulsar @xmath6 g , in line with the expected field strength of millisecond radio pulsars",
    ".    is undergoing an unexpectedly fast orbital evolution with the orbital period increasing on a timescale of @xmath7myr ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the binary has an orbital period of 2.01 hr @xcite and the donor star is a @xmath8 brown dwarf @xcite suggesting that the orbital evolution should be dominated by angular momentum loss via gravitational waves and possibly by magnetic braking  @xcite .",
    "the timescale of the orbital evolution is , however , too fast to be explained with such a scenario , and non - conservative processes with large mass loss from the system have been invoked ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested instead that interchanges of angular momentum between the companion and the orbit can dominate the short - term orbital evolution as seen in several binary millisecond pulsars @xcite .",

    "swift_-bat detected a new outburst of  @xcite .",
    "this is the 7th outburst observed since its discovery @xcite and the 6th monitored with _",
    "rxte_. we present a coherent pulsation analysis of the outburst and we complete the study of the spin and orbital evolution of  over a baseline of thirteen yr .",
    "we use all _ rxte _  proportional counter array ( pca ; @xcite ) public data for the 2011 outburst ( program - id 96027 ) .",
    "we construct the 2 - 16 kev x - ray light - curve with pca standard2 data averaging the flux for each observation and normalizing it in crab units ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "one burst is detected at mjd 55873.9 and all data with a flux more than twice the pre burst level are removed from the light - curve . for the timing analysis we use all photons ( excluding the burst interval ) in the energy band @xmath9 kev ( 5 - 37 absolute channels ) in event @xmath10 mode .",
    "the data are barycentered with the ftool _ faxbary _ by using the optical position @xcite and the jpl de405 solar system ephemeris .",
    "we fold @xmath11s long data segments in pulse profiles of 32 bins , keeping only those with signal - to - noise @xmath12 , giving @xmath13 false pulse detection for the entire outburst . the s",
    "/ n is defined as the ratio between the pulse amplitude and its @xmath14 statistical error .",
    "the folding procedure uses the preliminary ephemeris reported in @xcite . a fundamental ( @xmath15 ) and a first overtone ( @xmath16 )",
    "are detected in the pulse profiles .",
    "the toas are measured separately for each harmonic to avoid that pulse shape variability affects the fiducial point defining the pulse toa ( see @xcite for details ) . to follow the evolution of the orbit and the pulsar spin we fit separately the two sets of toas ( fundamental and first overtone ) with the software tempo2 @xcite .",
    "the initial model used is a keplerian circular orbit and a constant pulse frequency .",
    "we then repeat the folding procedure with the new timing solution until we reach convergence to the final orbital and pulse parameters . to calculate the errors on the rotational parameters we use monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , that account for the presence of long - timescale correlations in the pulse toas @xcite . to verify the presence of a spin frequency derivative",
    "we fit a pulse frequency and its time derivative to the toas and run @xmath17 mc simulations to estimate the significance of the measurements ( see @xcite and @xcite for further details ) .",
    "the first _ rxte _  pointed observation was taken on november 4 , @xmath18 days after the beginning of the outburst @xcite .",
    "the x - ray flux shows a peak at @xmath19 mcrab , remarkably higher than the peak luminosity in 2005 and 2008 and similar to the 1998 and 2002 values @xcite . since the observations started 5 days after the onset of the outburst , the true outburst peak at mjd 55868 ( observed by _",
    "swift_-bat ) has been missed by _",
    "rxte_. the _ rxte _  pca light - curve of the 2011 outburst is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the flux is observed to slowly decay over the entire duration of the main outburst , reaching a minimum flux of 8 mcrab on mjd 55880 .",
    "the flux then keeps decreasing with two bumps at mjd 55881 and 55884 , which might possibly be associated with the flaring - tail stage , when quasi periodic bumps are observed at low flux level ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , differently from the 2000 to 2008 outbursts , this phase is poorly sampled and difficult to characterize . during the tail a strong 1 hz modulation was reported for several outbursts ( 2000 , 2002 , 2005 ; @xcite ) but it is not detected in any of the 2011 observations .",
    "the source became undetectable on mjd 55885.9 ( november 20 ) and the monitoring abruptly ended on november 27 , due to solar constraints .",
    "these also prevented to establish whether at the time of the last observation  was in quiescence or in one of the faint ( @xmath20 ) states observed in the past with _",
    "swift _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations@xcite .",
    "the pulse profiles are very sinusoidal until mjd 55874 and then change becoming skewed with a more evident first overtone peaking on the right part of the profile . at mjd 55880 , during the possible flaring stage , the pulse profiles become very sinusoidal again , a phenomenon never observed in the previous outbursts .",
    "this is reflected in the rms amplitude of the two harmonics ( see fig  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the timing solution of the 2011 outburst is displayed in table  [ tab1 ]    .",
    "timing solution for the 2011 outburst [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    while a previous analysis of the five outbursts observed with _ rxte _  is available in @xcite .",
    "the authors found strong timing noise operating on the same timescales over which the pulse frequency and its time derivative were measured .",
    "the 2011 toa residuals of a @xmath21 model , show the typical behavior observed in the previous outbursts in both harmonics .",
    "we detect a strong phase jump in the fundamental with magnitude of 0.15 cycles ( 0.3 ms ) at mjd @xmath22 .",
    "this behaviour is similar to what was previously seen during the 2002 and 2005 outbursts , with phase jumps of @xmath23 cycles observed when the flux reached the transition from slow to fast decay ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the first overtone instead has no phase jump but displays a short timescale ( few minutes to @xmath24 day ) scattering slightly in excess of that expected from measurement errors alone .",
    "we use the phase information of the first overtone to phase connect across the phase jump of the fundamental ( see @xcite for details of the procedure ) . a net spin frequency derivative ( i.e. , measured over the entire outburst length ) is not detected , with upper limits of @xmath25 at the 95% confidence level . by removing the toas of the first observation in both harmonics ( when timing noise is strong ) and the 0.15 cycle phase jump for the fundamental , we obtain similar results with a more stringent constraint on the spin frequency derivative : @xmath26 ( @xmath27 c.l .",
    "the errors on the orbital parameters measured with the fundamental are only marginally affected by timing noise since they are measured on timescales ( 2 hr ) different than the timing noise one ( @xmath28days ) .",
    "this is verified by calculating a power spectrum of the toa residuals and comparing the poissonian level to the power at the orbital frequency @xmath29 .",
    "the excess power at @xmath29 is about @xmath30 and @xmath31 times the poissonian level for fundamental and first overtone respectively .",
    "we therefore rescale the statistical errors on the orbital parameters by the same factor .",
    "in 2009 @xcite proposed an alternative method to partially account for the timing noise in the toas of amxps .",
    "x - ray flux variations were found to be linearly correlated or anti - correlated with the pulse phases . instead of minimizing the rms of the toa residuals , @xcite minimized the @xmath32 of a linear fit to the phase - flux correlation , finding slightly different spin frequencies than those measured with rms minimization methods .",
    "the reason of this difference is that instead of treating timing noise as a red noise process of unknown origin , the variations of the x - ray flux are assumed to instantaneously affect the pulse phases .",
    "we found that while the fundamental frequency always follows a correlation , the first overtone in some cases behaves differently and we exclude it from our 2011 analysis . by repeating the same procedure outlined in @xcite for the 2011 outburst",
    ", we find a pulse frequency of @xmath33 , where @xmath14 errors have been rescaled by a factor 2.5 such that @xmath34 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the difference between this value and the pulse frequency @xmath35 obtained with standard rms minimization of the toa residuals is @xmath36 .",
    "we first fit the change of the six constant pulse frequencies ( from 1998 to 2011 ) of  using the values reported in @xcite and the 2011 frequency obtained from the flux - phase correlation technique .",
    "we rescale the errors of each spin frequency to give a @xmath34 and we fit a linear relation to the data .",
    "the fit gives a @xmath37 for 4 dof , and a spin - down of @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the value reported in @xcite .",
    "a spin frequency second derivative is not required by the fit , and we can place upper limits of @xmath39 ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "we also fit the 2011 outburst pulse frequency with the rms minimization method ( i.e. , tempo2 plus mc errors ) , together with the previous five spin frequency measurements obtained with the same technique @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 is high , 19.5 for 4 dof and we ascribe this almost exclusively to the 2000 outburst spin frequency ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if we remove the 2000 data , the fit returns a @xmath40 for 3 dof .",
    "the spin - down is constrained to be @xmath41 .",
    "this estimate is within 2@xmath42 from the value previously reported by @xcite and within 1@xmath42 when removing the 2000 outburst data .",
    "since both fits of the long - term spin frequency evolution are statitically acceptable , we can not decide which of the two values reported is closer to the true @xmath43 .",
    "the differences in the @xmath15 and long term @xmath43 found with the rms minimization and with the phase - flux correlation reflect a systematic uncertainty of @xmath44 that needs to be considered until the exact mechanism behind timing noise is identified .      to detect variations of the orbital period we use the procedure explained in @xcite that requires estimates for the times of passage through the ascending node @xmath45 at various outbursts .",
    "we choose as a reference point the @xmath46 value in table 1 of @xcite , and we calculate the residuals @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the @xmath49 outburst and @xmath50 is the closest integer to @xmath51 .",
    "the chosen @xmath52 is also reported in table 1 of @xcite . in a previous work @xcite we detected a @xmath53",
    "( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "when including the 2011 data , a parabolic fit gives a @xmath54 for 3 dof , thus suggesting that a constant increase of the orbital period is not the correct model for .",
    "we then add an orbital period second derivative @xmath55 and fit a cubic polynomial to the data .",
    "the fit is statistically acceptable , with @xmath37 for 2 dof and parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "a third time derivative or a sinusoidal model are not required by the data .",
    "we also tried to fix the @xmath58 and @xmath59 at the values observed up to 2008 and add a sinusoidal fit to the data to investigate the possibility of apsidal motion .",
    "the fit is statistically unacceptable and the periodicity found is of the order of @xmath60 yr , which is already orders of magnitude larger than the expected general relativistic effect alone .",
    "the long term spin - down continues with a constant rate comparable to what has been measured between 1998 and 2008 .",
    "the only plausible explanation for the spin - down in  requires magnetic - dipole radiation with a surface magnetic field of the neutron star at the poles @xmath61 ( for a radius @xmath62 ) for a magnetic - dipole moment @xmath63 .",
    "this range includes the different spin - down measurement methods reported in   [ mc ] and   [ phaseflux ] and is close to the @xmath64 field obtained with fe line spectral fitting @xcite and accretion disk modeling @xcite .",
    "the remarkably constant long term spin - down places stringent constraints on any ongoing spin - up during an outburst .",
    "if spin frequency variations were larger than the upper limit reported by @xcite ( @xmath4 ) , they would produce a scatter in the observed spin frequencies of the order of @xmath65 ( for @xmath66 ) .",
    "this scatter is not observed with statistical errors of @xmath67 ( see fig  [ fig2 ] ) , and suggests that the net spin - up during an outburst is at best very small in magnitude for .",
    "the orbital period @xmath58 indicates that the orbit of  is expanding and accelerating at a very fast rate .",
    "the timescale for the acceleration is : @xmath68 suggesting that the identified @xmath59 might not represent the secular evolution of the orbital period .",
    "if we assume that the measured acceleration is constant , then  has changed sign of @xmath59 about 25 years ago .",
    "there is , however , no reason for @xmath69 to be constant , since we are not sensitive to higher order derivatives and both @xmath59 and @xmath69 might be part of long timescale variations similar to those observed in binary millisecond pulsars @xcite . until the 2008 outburst ,",
    "when only a constant @xmath59 was detected , two interpretations were given : a secular orbital evolution due to non - conservative mass transfer ( @xcite , @xcite ) and a short - term evolution associated with exchange of angular momentum between the donor star and the orbit @xcite .",
    "if  has increased its mass loss due to an enhancement of the donor ablation , then the wind loss from the companion ( @xmath70 ) needs to increase at a rate comparable with that of the orbital period , since @xmath71 .",
    "the mass loss is related to @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the ablation power , @xmath74 is the pulsar rotational spin - down power and @xmath75 and @xmath76 the donor radius and the semi - major axis of the binary . to explain the acceleration @xmath69 , the energy loss of the pulsar @xmath74 needs to have increased ( in absolute value ) in the last 13 years by a factor of @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath77 , the spin - down @xmath43 needs to vary at a rate @xmath78 to reach the energy loss required . by using the long - term spin evolution presented in the previous section we can put constraints on @xmath79 .",
    "we conclude that the enhanced ablation scenario is not supported by the observations .    a dynamically induced period derivative in the gravitational potential well of a third body",
    "can also be excluded .",
    "the effect of a potential well is identical on the orbital and spin frequencies and derivatives : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the n - th time derivative of the orbital or spin frequency , @xmath82 is the acceleration due to the third body , @xmath83 is a unit vector along the line of sight and @xmath84 the speed of light . to explain the observed @xmath69 we need @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which is not observed .",
    "if the measured orbital evolution is a short - term event , then one explanation can be found with the donor spin - orbit coupling model .",
    "a coupling between the pulsar rotational energy loss ( in form of winds or fields ) and the orbital angular momentum @xcite is ruled out by the small magnitude of the effect produced by the tiny @xmath74 of . a mass quadrupole variation of the donor star is a more promising possibility .",
    "a change @xmath87 in the mass quadrupole leads to a change in orbital period @xcite : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath75 are the donor mass and radius , @xmath90 is a thin shell of mass generating the quadrupole , and @xmath91 the angular velocity of the star .",
    "if we assume that the angular velocity of the donor is almost synchronous with the orbital angular velocity , then the variation @xmath92 observed in the last 13 years gives : @xmath93 the observed orbital period variations in the eclipsing millisecond pulsar psr j2051 - 0827 and psr b1957 + 20 are likely to be caused by changes in the quadrupole moment of the companion @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a magnetic activity cycle that leads to a deformation of the star at the origin of this behavior .",
    "the donor star of  is also in roche lobe contact , whereas binary millisecond pulsars are detached systems .",
    "if the orbital period of  has decreased in the past for some time , then the roche lobe has moved across the outer envelope of the brown dwarf enhancing the mass transfer rate .",
    "a detailed discussion of this effect is beyond the scope of this letter , but we can speculate that  has gone through periodic episodes ( each lasting @xmath94 yr ) of enhanced accretion in the past .",
    "this effect is opposite during the accelerated orbital expansion , with the mass transfer being less than in the non - accelerated case .",
    "the quadrupolar moment change has also the effect of heating the star , providing an explanation for the large entropy content of the donor @xcite .",
