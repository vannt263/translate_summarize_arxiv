    "<S> we consider the double scaling limit for a model of @xmath0 non - intersecting squared bessel processes in the confluent case : all paths start at time @xmath1 at the same positive value @xmath2 , remain positive , and are conditioned to end at time @xmath3 at @xmath4 . after appropriate rescaling , </S>",

    "<S> were shown to be the usual scaling limits from random matrix theory . here </S>",
    "<S> , we describe the limit as @xmath6 of the correlation kernel at critical time @xmath9 and in the double scaling regime . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an integral representation for the limit kernel which bears some connections with the pearcey kernel . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is based on the study of a @xmath10 matrix valued riemann - hilbert problem by the deift - zhou steepest descent method . </S>",
