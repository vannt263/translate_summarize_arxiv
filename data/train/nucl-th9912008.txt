    "the relativistic coulomb excitation of nuclei is a well - known phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "it is expected to play an important role in collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy nuclei at new colliders , rhic and lhc  @xcite .",
    "the process may be described in the framework of the weizscker - williams method of equivalent photons . according to this method the impact of lorentz - boosted coulomb field of a nucleus on the collision partner",
    "may be treated as the absorption of equivalent photons .",
    "due to the coherent nature of photon emission by the nucleus , such photons are almost real , @xmath0 , @xmath1 is the nuclear radius .",
    "therefore photonuclear reaction data obtained in experiments with real monoenergetic photons and appropriate theoretical models describing photonuclear reactions may be used to predict the properties of electromagnetic dissociation process .    since",
    "an ultrarelativistic nucleus moving at the impact parameter @xmath2 with the velocity @xmath3 , ( @xmath4 ) spends a short time @xmath5 near the collision partner , the virtual photon spectrum contains all the frequencies up to the maximum energy @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fine structure constant , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the modified bessel functions and @xmath11 .",
    "the mean number of photons absorbed by the collision partner of mass @xmath12 is defined by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the appropriate total photoabsorption cross section obtained starting from the photoneutron threshold at @xmath15 mev .    assuming the poison distribution for the multiphoton absorption with the mean multiplicity @xmath16 ,  eq.([eq:2 ] ) ,",
    "the integral cross sections are calculated for the first- and second - order processes  @xcite for a particular dissociation channel  @xmath17 : @xmath18 @xmath19 with the following single and double photon spectral functions : @xmath20 the values @xmath21 and @xmath22 defined as the branching ratios for the considered disintegration channel  @xmath17 in the single and double photon absorption , respectively , have to be calculated by our multistep model .",
    "similar expressions may be written for the differential distributions of produced particles on the rapidity , transverse momentum and other variables .    in order to obtain @xmath23 and",
    "@xmath24 several mechanisms are included in a new relativistic electromagnetic dissociation ( reldis ) code for the monte carlo simulation , namely , the intranuclear cascade of fast particles produced after the photon absorption on a nucleon or nuclear pair  @xcite , and the evaporation of nucleons and lightest fragments , binary fission or multifragmentation  @xcite at a later stage of interaction .",
    "the multifragmentation process dominates when the excitation energy of residual nucleus , @xmath25 , exceeds @xmath26  mev / nucleon and is described by the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm )  @xcite . for fissile nuclei",
    "the evaporation may take place before or after the fission .",
    "the competition of evaporation and fission is also described with the smm .",
    "the lightest fragments may be also created via coalescence of fast nucleons into d , t , @xmath27 or @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "the decay of highly excited light residual nuclei with @xmath29 is treated by the fermi break - up mechanism  @xcite",
    ". other details of the calculation scheme may be found in refs .",
    "depending on the photon energy , @xmath30 , and mass number , @xmath12 , different processes take place in the nuclear photoabsorption . due to the contributions of several mechanisms : @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 the calculated double differential spectra @xmath34 of pions and protons have complex shapes above the pion production threshold  @xcite .",
    "the spectra of fast particles @xmath35 and @xmath36 predicted by the model were compared in ref .",
    "@xcite with available sets of experimental data at @xmath37 mev including the data obtained with kek - tanashi , the 1.3-gev electron synchrotron .",
    "a satisfactory description of the spectra was obtained .",
    "fast hadrons produced after the photon absorption initiate a cascade of subsequent collisions with the intranuclear nucleons leading to the heating of a residual nucleus .",
    "later the nucleus undergoes de - excitation by means of the emission of nucleons and fragments . because of a low coulomb barrier in light nuclei the rates of proton and neutron emission are comparable .    fragment spectra in the photoabsorption on a carbon nucleus",
    "are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] .",
    "the low energy part of the deuteron spectra is explained by the explosive fermi break - up while the high energy part is attributed to the coalescence mechanism .",
    "since the main part of fast nucleons is emitted in the forward direction , the coalescence contribution dominates at small angles . on the contrary ,",
    "the distribution of deuterons from fermi break - up is nearly isotropic .     and 200 mev / c , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]    because of the option to accelerate also light oxygen ions at rhic , the calculations of the electromagnetic dissociation contribution for such ions should take into account both of the considered mechanisms .",
    "the photoabsorption scenario is very different for heavy nuclei , gold and lead . in this case",
    "neutrons are the most abundant particles produced in the electromagnetic collisions of ultrarelativistic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "when a heavy nucleus absorbs photons in the giant resonance region , @xmath38 mev , the evaporation model may be used with the assumption @xmath39 which leads to the emission of one or two neutrons .    on the other side of the equivalent photon spectrum ,",
    "when @xmath30 reaches the value of several gev , the multiple pion photoproduction on intranuclear nucleons becomes the main absorption mechanism . in this case up to 95% of the photon energy is released in the fast particles on average .",
    "nevertheless , the remaining energy deposited in the residual nucleus is sufficient for evaporating many neutrons or even multifragmentation  @xcite . as it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite for pbpb collisions at sps ( @xmath40 gev beam ) and lhc ( @xmath41 tev beams ) the mean neutron multiplicities are 4.2 and 8.8 , respectively .",
    "the same value for auau collisions at rhic ( @xmath42 gev ) is equal to 7.2 .",
    "the neutron multiplicity distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmult ] .",
    "they are strongly peaked at the single neutron emission channel due to gdr decay , while there is a long tail of the multiple neutron emission originating from high excitations .",
    "these results provide important information for designing large - rapidity detectors and zero - degree calorimeters at rhic and lhc .",
    "[ fig : nmult ]",
    "cern sps accelerator currently supplies the highest energy available for heavy ion studies .",
    "a detailed understanding of fragmentation mechanisms at sps energies provides an important point for the extrapolation of the theoretical and experimental results to rhic and lhc energies .     produced in the electromagnetic dissociation of @xmath43 ions at sps.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ]     produced in the electromagnetic dissociation of @xmath43 ions at sps.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=95.0% ]",
    "partial break - up charge changing cross sections ( @xmath44 ) for 158 agev @xmath43 ions interacting with various targets , from h to pb , were measured recently  @xcite .",
    "although the contributions to fragmentation due to the electromagnetic and nuclear forces were not separated in the experiment  @xcite , one can use reldis code to evaluate the role of the electromagnetic dissociation for each particular dissociation mode . as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zdis ] , the main part of charge changing cross sections in pbpb collisions may be explained by the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "calculations show that multiple neutron emission also plays a role in each of the partial charge changing channels with @xmath45 for pbpb collisions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : zdis_neut ] .",
    "the lost of each proton is accompanied with a high probability by the multiple neutron emission .",
    "for example , up to 20 neutrons may be emitted in @xmath46 fragmentation channel , and the emission of 810 neutrons is the most probable process .",
    "this is evident from the fact that due to a high coulomb barrier of pb nucleus , photoemission of protons takes place well above the gdr region , particularly in the region of quasideuteron absorption , where the excitation energy , @xmath47 mev , is sufficient to evaporate many neutrons . on the contrary ,",
    "the mass distribution for @xmath48 channel is completely different since in this case @xmath49 and @xmath50 emission in gdr region strongly dominates .",
    "however , a long tail of the multiple neutron emission also exists in this channel .",
    "our expectation of the intense neutron emission in the charge changing electromagnetic collisions of heavy nuclei is very different from a simple picture assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the rates of neutron and proton emission above the photoproton threshold were determined by @xmath51 ratio of the nucleus which undergoes fragmentation .",
    "a detailed understanding of the fragmentation mechanism may be obtained by measurements of fragment masses and detection of neutrons produced in collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy ions .",
    "a variety of fragmentation mechanisms takes place in the electromagnetic dissociation of ultrarelativistic heavy ions , namely the coalescence , fermi break - up , evaporation , fission and multifragmentation .",
    "a partial or complete disintegration of the colliding nuclei is possible despite the absence of geometrical overlap of the nuclear densities .",
    "comparison with cern sps data on pbpb collisions demonstrates the dominance of electromagnetic dissociation in the partial charge - changing fragmentation channels with @xmath45 .",
    "reldis model predicts also a very intense neutron emission in such channels .     + the author gratefully acknowledges the fruitful collaboration with a.s.botvina , j.p.bondorf , a.s.iljinov and i.n.mishustin on the subjects of this talk .",
    "discussions with a.b.kurepin , g.giacomelli , m.giorgini , l.patrizii and p.serra are greatly appreciated .",
