    "the polaron problem is an old but not fully solved problem of solid state physics .",
    "the _ small polaron _ theory which will be considered here assumes a short - range electron - phonon interaction and explicitly includes the lattice periodicity @xcite .",
    "it is therefore aimed to study systems where screening is effective .",
    "this addresses for instance the situation of a metal consisting of different bands , one of them being narrow enough to allow for a strong coupling to phonons .",
    "in fact , if the crystal can be considered as made of strongly deformable molecular - like units with narrow - band electrons hopping from one to another , then the conditions for a strong polaron effect can be realized @xcite . in realistic structures , for example transition metal oxides or organic metals ,",
    "such units exist which provide local ( oscillation ) phonon modes and are indeed strongly coupled to well - defined electronic orbitals . recently",
    ", much interest has been revived into polaron theory , due to important classes of materials , including the high - temperature superconductors@xcite and the  colossal  magnetoresistance manganites@xcite .",
    "in fact , in the insulating parent phase of superconducting cuprates , polarons have been unambiguously detected by optical measurements @xcite , and some evidence of strong electron - phonon coupling effects has been given recently in the metallic phase@xcite .",
    "in the manganites , on the other hand , strong static or dynamic jahn - teller distorsions appear at the metal - insulator transitions @xcite .",
    "the problem of a single polaron becomes relevant for low carrier density , but also by itself , as a paradigm to study the effect of strong coupling electron - phonon interactions . in the intermediate and strong coupling regimes ,",
    "the small polaron problem is already a non trivial many - body problem@xcite : the difficulty consists in describing the dressing of the electron by a coherent multiphonon cloud , moving coherently with it such as to form a quasiparticle .",
    "perturbative techniques , starting either from the free electron limit or from the atomic limit ( strong - coupling expansions)@xcite fail in describing the dressing effect in the intermediate regimes . on the other hand ,",
    "nonperturbative solutions based for instance on variational ansatz @xcite are expected to give reliable results only for the ground state properties like the effective polaron mass .",
    "but no satisfactory description of the full spectral properties has been obtained so far .",
    "holstein s molecular crystal model@xcite involves tight - binding electrons coupled to dispersionless optical phonons . as a function of phonon frequency and electron - phonon coupling",
    ", it displays a variety of interesting regimes .",
    "the strong coupling regime leads to the formation of small polarons , with a dramatic increase of the effective mass for low phonon frequencies@xcite . on the other hand , for exactly zero phonon frequency , an adiabatic solution can be obtained with self - trapping of the polarons appearing only above some critical coupling value , in dimensions greater than one @xcite .    in this context , the recent discovery of a nonperturbative theory for interacting quantum problems , based on the limit of infinite lattice coordination ( or dimensionality ) @xcite , opened a new way of attacking strong electron - phonon problems .",
    "a few recent papers have addressed the problem of superconductive and charge - density wave instabilities of the metallic state , close to half filling , either in weak coupling@xcite , using self - consistent techniques @xcite , or from the local impurity method @xcite , also including a local electron repulsion ( the holstein - hubbard problem)@xcite .",
    "also , a solution at finite density in the adiabatic limit ( zero phonon frequency ) was obtained @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "exact results for the spectral function of a single polaron at zero temperature were recently reported by the authors@xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to provide a complete description of the small polaron crossover based upon the knowledge of spectral quantities in the whole range of parameters and also at non zero temperature .",
    "the most striking features are found in an intermediate coupling regime where no known approximation scheme works .",
    "similarly to the hubbard model , the infinite dimensional limit allows to map the lattice problem onto a self - consistent local impurity model , here called `` polaron impurity''@xcite .",
    "it consists of a single - site electron - phonon problem , embedded into a quantum effective medium characterized by an effective  free  propagator which has to be self - consistently determined .",
    "this mapping preserves all the complexities of the quantum dynamics of the problem , namely the interplay between electron and lattice fluctuations _ at the local level_. the crucial point here is that for a single electron the impurity model can be _ analytically _ solved by a recursion formula for any non - interacting impurity propagator , leading to a _ continued - fraction expansion _ ( cfe )",
    "solution for the fully dressed propagator .",
    "this unique feature allows to obtain at the end an exact solution for the lattice problem in the limit of infinite dimensions .",
    "this solution provides directly , with modest computational efforts , the ground state as well as the spectral properties in the thermodynamic limit and at any temperature .",
    "therefore it is somehow complementary to numerical works performed in finite dimensions , such as monte carlo simulations@xcite or exact diagonalization of finite clusters@xcite .",
    "indeed , the former are limited to finite temperatures , and the latter have to deal with finite size effects .",
    "the main result of the present self - consistent impurity approach is that , in the crossover regime , low and high energy scales can be accurately described , like in the mott - hubbard transition problem@xcite .",
    "polaron states in the low energy range appear as coherent strongly renormalized quasiparticle states , while at higher energies the electron is incoherently scattered by a quasiclassical random distortion .",
    "these features are clearly displayed in the low phonon frequency regime , where the spectral density displays low energy peaks coexisting with a broad and incoherent high energy continuum .",
    "this provides a novel and physically transparent representation of the polaron crossover .",
    "as the coupling strength is increased , it proceeds through successive opening of gaps in the spectral density , separating polaron subbands . at intermediate couplings , and decreasing the phonon frequency , one finds that the dressing of electron states by a multiphonon coherent cloud drastically reduces the effective electronic energy scales and leads to an adiabaticity `` catastrophe '' in the low energy spectrum . in terms of a perturbative expansion ,",
    "this can be clearly ascribed to high order vertex dressing .",
    "it is important to emphasize that even in an intermediate regime of couplings a well defined polaron quasiparticle excitation is present at low energy . also , an important feature is the appearance of a discrete set of frequencies where the self - energy diverges within the low - energy gaps of the spectrum .",
    "those points are sensitive to disorder@xcite .",
    "in particular , at finite temperatures , they enhance the damping and thermal broadening of polaron states in their vicinity , leading to a loss of coherence of the main polaron subband .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the holstein molecular crystal model and we discuss the main limiting cases in a finite dimensional lattice . in section iii",
    ", we introduce the impurity analogy and the exact cfe solution of the impurity model , at zero and at finite temperature . in the same section",
    "the limiting results of the cfe are presented and compared to the finite dimensional case .",
    "section iv presents the general results of the cfe solution of the impurity problem .",
    "section v is devoted to conclusions and to the discussion of possible extensions of this method to finite density , in relation with a coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) formulation of the cfe .",
    "in this section we shall summarize the main results concerning the holstein model in finite dimensions , in the limit in which analytical calculations can be performed .",
    "we especially focus on the role of dimensionnality , which will allow to discuss later how our theory ( exact in infinite dimensions ) can be compared with results in finite dimensional lattices .",
    "the holstein model consists of tight - binding conduction electrons interacting with local dispersionless phonon modes .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath0 where @xmath1 creates ( destroys ) an electron with spin @xmath2 at site @xmath3 , and @xmath4 creates ( destroys ) a phonon at site @xmath3 .",
    "the hopping matrix elements @xmath5 connect nearest neighboring sites of a lattice in @xmath6 dimensions and we assume they give rise to a band of half - bandwidth @xmath7 .",
    "this model possesses two independent control parameters@xcite .",
    "the first one is the bare coupling constant @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the polaron energy obtained in the atomic limit ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the second one is the adiabatic parameter @xmath11 .",
    "a third parameter can be conveniently introduced as a combination of the above ones , as @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are commonly used as parameters in the perturbative analysis , the parameter @xmath16 which measures the strength of the lattice deformation involved in the polaron effect will show to be crucial in the strong coupling regime .",
    "let us stress that these parameters are defined from the bare energy scales @xmath17 in the hamiltonian , contrarily to usual definitions in the theory of electron - phonon interaction in metals where in particular the dressed phonon frequency is used .",

    "1 shows the corresponding regions in the ( @xmath23 ) plane .    throughout this paper",
    "we shall concentrate on the problem of one electron in interaction with phonons , i.e. a system which density is zero in the thermodynamic limit . to analyze the perturbative behaviour of the model we shall first discuss the simplifications due to this limit .",
    "the discussion is restricted to the zero temperature limit but can be easily generalized to finite temperatures ( see section ii b ) . for a single electron",
    "the green s function in the site representation can be defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the vacuum for phonons and electrons and the unessential spin indices are omitted .",
    "one observes that there is only one possible ordering ( @xmath26 ) of the t - product , so that the function is purely retarded@xcite .",
    "then the standard perturbation theory is introduced in the site representation by defining the electron self - energy @xmath27@xcite through the dyson equation @xmath28_{i , j } + \\sum_{k , l } [ { \\cal g}_0]_{i , k } \\sigma_{k , l } g_{l , j}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the free electron propagator .    at zero density ,",
    "the following simplifications hold :    * a general self - energy diagram consists of a single electron line first emitting and then absorbing phonons .",
    "* the emission ( absorption ) of a phonon consists in subtracting ( adding ) a quantum of phonon frequency @xmath30 to the energy of the propagating electron line .",
    "the first statement comes from the absence of density fluctuations in the zero density limit ( no bubble diagrams , no phonon renormalization ) .",
    "moreover in the zero temperature limit all the phonons must be created from vacuum before being absorbed . to illustrate the second statement , we first notice that in a generic self - energy diagram involving @xmath31 phonon lines , it is always possible to choose an integration contour which avoids all the poles and cuts of the electron green s function , since the retarded electron propagator is analytic in the upper half plane",
    ". then the only contribution comes from the poles associated to the phonon lines .",
    "the perturbation expansion of the self - energy to second order in @xmath32 gives a local ( * k*-independent ) self - energy @xmath33 where @xmath29 is the local free propagator obtained by the knowledge of the free particle dos @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "notice that dimensionality enters only through the free dos @xcite .",
    "the electron effective mass , in the case of a local self - energy , is easily calculated via @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ground state energy .",
    "let us first consider the low phonon frequency regime .",
    "in this case for electron states lying at the bottom of a band , dimensionality effects enter through the band shape near the band bottom and control both the behaviour of the effective mass and the spectral properties .",
    "we assume that near the band bottom ( @xmath38 ) @xmath39 , then one has from eqs .",
    "( [ 2nd - order],[eff - mass - def ] ) for @xmath40@xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a numerical constant .",
    "@xcite it is not surprising that we do not recover the expected `` migdal '' result @xmath43 .",
    "in fact this last result is obtained assuming an infinite flat band which could be the case of a metal which fermi energy lies far from singularities ( like van hove ones ) in the dos . from eq .",
    "[ eff - mass - ad ] we can define an effective coupling @xmath44 as in the case of van - hove singularities@xcite in order to write @xmath45 .",
    "the effective coupling strength @xmath46 tends to zero for vanishing phonon frequency in dimensions @xmath47 ( keeping @xmath14 constant ) , while it goes to infinity for @xmath48 .",
    "surprisingly , a _ perturbative _ analysis provides non trivial information about the adiabatic limit : for @xmath47 we expect a free electron behaviour while for @xmath48 the perturbation expansion _ around a delocalized solution _ fails in the adiabatic limit for any finite @xmath14 .",
    "this is consistent with the non - perturbative findings of ref.@xcite , where it is shown that renormalization effects are absent up to a _",

    "it is worth comparing the spectral properties obtained at finite bandwidth and zero density with those derived up to second order in @xmath32 in the classical work of engelsberg and schrieffer@xcite in the case of an infinite bandwidth .",

    "in fact , a problem arises for example in the case of an hypercubic lattice , which has a gaussian dos with an infinite tail towards low energy @xcite . for large but finite dimensions",
    "the scaling of the hopping matrix elements implies that the ground state energy of one electron is proportional to @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , the formation of a small polaron requires an electron - phonon coupling energy of the same order of magnitude and a coupling constant @xmath14 which diverges with @xmath105 .",
    "indeed , just like the formation of a bound state from an external potential , polaron formation by self - trapping requires an infinite coupling strength in an ordinarily connected lattice in infinite dimensions ( see ref .",

    "more generally , in interacting fermion problems , with this particular choice , localization phenomena can be found even in the infinite dimension limit , for instance the mott - hubbard transition is correctly obtained at a finite coupling for the half - filled hubbard model@xcite .",
    "let us now come to the essential simplification occurring in the limit of infinite dimensions , namely the fact that the electron self - energy is _ local _ in space .",
    "the usual argument which holds for local electron interactions @xcite can be worked out also in the context of the holstein model .",
    "one can carry on the standard argument but taking into account also the phonon self - energies and electron - phonon vertices instead of the electron - electron four leg vertices @xcite .",

    "let us now turn to the low phonon frequency regime , in which the formation of polaronic bands is qualitatively different and exhibits novel features .",

    ", the gap is formed and keeps increasing until a second gap is formed at higher energy , and so on . by the way ,",
    "let us underline that the total spectral weight carried by the polaron bands , when they are well separated , is in general different from that obtained in the atomic limit .",
    "for instance , the @xmath236 band spectral weight is always larger than @xmath249 .",
    "an effect related to the formation of subbands , which arises in the intermediate coupling regime , is the divergency of the self - energy at one and subsequently more and more frequencies located in the gaps as the coupling strength is increased . in the presence of disorder , external excitations or at finite temperature",
    ", a non zero spectral density can appear around these energies .",
    "we thus expect such excited states within the gaps to have a huge damping and to be localized , while the ground state can keep its delocalized character .",
    "for that motivation the authors@xcite who found such behaviour in the context of the holstein - hubbard model named it _",
    "dynamical localization_. we must stress that the relevance of such a phenomenon concerning the mobility properties such as the ac conductivity can not be tested using the cfe formalism . however , we draw attention to the fact that this is a very general phenomenon , which occurs here for a single electron as a polaronic feature i.e. is related to the multi - peaked structure of the green s function .",
    "the occurrence of such self - energy divergencies requires that the states at the edges of two consecutive bands have an infinite lifetime ( @xmath247 ) at zero temperature . in this case",
    ", the self - energy fulfills the eq .",
    "( [ ground - state - eq ] ) at the extrema of the energy gap , so that the real part of @xmath250 changes sign within the gap without crossing the values @xmath251 . as a consequence a divergency in @xmath252 occurs at a point @xmath253 located in the gap . in the bethe lattice we have the condition @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the second stage expansion of the self - energy in the cfe of eq .",
    "( [ se - rec ] ) . equation ( [ dyn - loc ] ) may have more than one solution , i.e. many such points are expected for large values of @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "13 ) . in the atomic limit ( @xmath72 )",
    "there is an infinite number of them , located in the gaps between the peaks of the atomic spectral density .",
    "in the ( @xmath14,@xmath15 ) plane , at least one self - energy divergency exists on the right of the dashed line in fig .",
    "we note that a self - energy divergency is formed only in a preexisting energy gap . accordingly , when increasing the coupling strenght a gap appears first , separating a coherent polaronic peak from an incoherent excited band , and then a self - energy divergency occurs in the gap when the states at the bottom of the excited band become coherent .    this phenomenon should affect the spectral properties in the presence of disorder@xcite or at finite temperatures ( see below ) .",
    "in fact , whenever there is a mechanism which is able to give rise to excited states in the proximity of those special points ( this can be due to the lorentzian tails induced by disorder ) the singularity in the imaginary part of the self - energy becomes a finite broadening lorentzian , which implies a loss of coherence of the neighboring states . the consequences on the electronic spectra at finite temperatures will be analyzed in the following section .      in this section we present the results obtained at finite temperature using the cfe formulation of eq .",
    "( [ gfreq - t ] ) and following .",
    "the analysis focuses on the intermediate regime where no `` classical '' schemes of approximation are available .    in holstein s original treatment of polaron motion@xcite",
    ", a distinction is made between transition amplitudes which are _ diagonal _ in the phonon number , contributing to the polaron coherent motion around the ground state energy , and those which are _ non - diagonal _ , giving rise to hopping - like motion . while the former decrease in the presence of thermal disorder , the latter are thermally activated .",
    "this allows to determine a crossover temperature @xmath256 where the polaron crosses over from coherent to hopping - like motion , which is believed to hold at strong coupling or in the large phonon frequency regime .",
    "this crossover can also be observed in the one - electron green s function . to this purpose",
    ", we show the spectra in the intermediate coupling regime for increasing @xmath104 ( see fig .",
    "the effect is twofold : first , as is already known from the atomic limit@xcite , ( see eq .",
    "[ atomicgreent ] ) , polaron peaks appear at negative energies .",
    "secondly , scattering by thermally populated phonon states causes finite lifetime effects , in addition to the zero - temperature scattering processes ( see section iv b ) , as it can be seen by inspecting the imaginary part of the self - energy .",
    "indeed , one notices that the negative-@xmath102 subbands are incoherent .",
    "moreover , at low @xmath104 , a small peak appears in @xmath218 , close to the upper boundary of the @xmath236 polaron band . for larger @xmath104",
    ", some spectral weight develops in this region and contributes to gradually broaden this band , until the gap eventually disappears .",
    "_ this effect is enhanced in the vicinity of a self - energy divergency _ , which is extremely sensitive to thermal disorder .",
    "this gives rise to an inhomogeneous broadening of the main polaron band .    by evaluating the number of coherent states ( with @xmath257 ) within the low energy subbands in the intermediate coupling regime",
    ", one can qualitatively confirm the validity of holstein s prediction for the crossover temperature , i.e. @xmath258 . on the other hand , the high energy part of the spectra is slightly smoothened by the temperature .",
    "a different scenario holds for other values of the parameters .",
    "results are presented in figures 17 , 18 , 19 where the low - energy part of the electronic spectra is shown for the same parameter values as in figs .",
    "10 , 11 , 12 , for @xmath259 .",
    "one notices that in the high phonon frequency regime , the gaps between polaron bands exist even at high temperatures , and temperature weakly affects the overall shape of the positive @xmath102-th order polaron subbands ( see fig .",
    "17 ) . on the opposite , for low phonon frequencies , the shape of the polaron subbands",
    "is drastically modified ( see fig .",
    "19 ) : the spectral weight of each of them is roughly conserved ( for not too large @xmath104 ) , but they are noticeably enlarged , and consequently their height diminishes .",
    "one must underline that at those temperatures , the gaps are not destroyed by thermal fluctuations , apart from vanishingly small spectral density tails .",
    "we have shown how the dynamical mean - field theory can be successfully used to solve the single polaron problem at any temperature .",
    "the form of the propagator as a continued fraction expansion , together with the self - consistency condition for the non - interacting local impurity propagator , shows that this theory yields an _",
    "analytic _ solution of the problem , even if some elementary numerics is required to obtain the full spectra .",
    "we have also presented in section ii some results in the limiting regimes in the infinite dimensional case in order to show that the use of a semi - elliptic free dos gives sensible results , in agreement with the usual three dimensional solutions .",
    "this gives confidence that the results from the dynamical mean - field theory are quite reliable as reflecting the actual physics in dimension larger than 2 . on the contrary , in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "one or more gaps are always present in the spectrum , i.e. polarons form at any coupling @xcite .",
    "the properties we find for the ground state are in agreement with the conventional wisdom , in particular the absence of a phase transition , as soon as quantum fluctuations of the lattice are taken into account . the crossover gets sharper as the phonon frequency is decreased for fixed @xmath14 , and becomes an abrupt transition from a free electron state to a small polaron state at @xmath260 .",
    "this comes directly from the first order nature of the transition in the adiabatic limit , clearly displayed by the direct solution .    beyond the ground state properties ,",
    "the full electronic spectrum clarifies the nature of the polaron crossover . for low and intermediate phonon frequencies , as the coupling is increased , several energy gaps successively open up in the spectrum , leaving at low energies coherent or quasi - coherent polaronic subbands .",
    "these bands can be followed up to very large couplings or large phonon frequencies towards the atomic limit .",
    "therefore they are the manifestation of nonperturbative processes , as is clearly demonstrated by the interpretation of the cfe in terms of a diagrammatic expansion .",
    "thus , even if the ground - state properties show a continuous crossover , some higher energy features show a qualitative change of behaviour , the phenomenon of gap opening .",
    "let us make more precise the  lattice ",
    "interpretation of these polaronic subbands .",
    "once the self - energy @xmath202 is known , and for a given non - interacting lattice dos , an effective dispersion relation can be found for each well - separated subband , by finding the poles of the spectral function eq.([spectral - function ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to what is commonly understood as polaron states , i.e. bound states of an electron with a phonon cloud , a number @xmath102 of phonons being excited in addition . for a translationally invariant finite dimensional lattice",
    "the quantum numbers underlying the local ( integrated ) spectral function are the _ total _ momentum @xmath261 of the polaron@xcite and the excited phonon number @xmath102 .",
    "this obviously holds only if the subbands are coherent , i.e. only for low enough @xmath102 , according to the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the low phonon frequency regime exhibits in the crossover region a coexistence of extremely narrow polaronic subbands at low energy and a broad featureless continuum at high energy . while the low - energy features directly follow from the atomic or high phonon frequency limit , the continuum is directly related to the adiabatic solution .",
    "the behaviour near the critical point ( @xmath262 ) can be understood as follows : increasing @xmath15 , the discontinuity in the low energy properties becomes a sharp crossover , due to very weak coherent tunneling between small polaron states and quasi - free states of the equivalent impurity model .",
    "translated into the language of the lattice problem , it leads to the emergence of coherent  heavy  polaron quasiparticle states ( `` resonances '' ) .",
    "however , the high energy part of the spectrum does not reveal any qualitative change in this region of parameters .",
    "this behaviour demonstrates how the usual concept of `` adiabaticity '' , as commonly employed in metals for small @xmath30 , fails in the present problem : the sharp transition at @xmath201 and the occurrence of extremely narrow polaron features indicates on the contrary the occurrence of an  adiabaticity catastrophe  .",
    "this is due to the relevance of high order vertex corrections in the perturbation expansion .    in this work",
    "the application of the lisa approach has been limited to the one - particle propagator .",
    "in fact , no exact procedure has been found yet to calculate analytically for instance two particle propagators .",
    "this would allow to compute the ( dc and optical ) conductivity of polarons .",
    "on the other hand , a better understanding of the polaron crossover could be gained by calculating the dynamical electron - lattice correlation function .",
    "let us now comment about extensions of this technique to finite electron density . as mentioned before",
    ", the cfe expansion keeps for the self - energy the same functional structure as that of the atomic limit .",
    "thus it is equivalent to a cpa approach which could be extended at finite densities .",
    "it is however easy to show ( by perturbation expansion ) that the cpa approximation fails even at the first non - vanishing order in the density .",
    "as far as spectral properties are concerned , the cpa failure is particularly evident in the low energy part of the spectrum , as is well known from equivalent approximations for the hubbard model .",
    "nevertheless , our main result i.e. the coexistence of low energy coherent and high energy incoherent structures is a picture which should be qualitatively preserved at least at low carriers densities .",
    "finally , although at zero density it is impossible to access the correlation functions involved in the calculation of the optical conductivity , let us mention that our results suggest an interpretation of the infrared response of oxide superconductors in the insulating phase . in these materials@xcite , absorption spectra for low carrier densities exhibit a discrete set of narrow peaks at low energies plus an incoherent background at higher energies . from our point of view , this could be ascribed to multiphonon excitations in the intermediate phonon frequency regime .",
