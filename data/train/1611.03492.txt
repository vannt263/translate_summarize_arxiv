    "in spite of the well established evidence for its existence in the universe , the nature of dark matter remains elusive . at present , most of the survived hints for particular properties of dark matter seem to come from the cosmological and astrophysical side . in the case",
    "the dark matter or part of it has a particle physics origin , it would be of great importance to probe the theory behind in the laboratories , just like probing the other known particles .    in this paper , we focus on a very simple setup where the dark matter is a fermion charged under a dark @xmath0 gauge symmetry and its interactions",
    "are mediated by a massive vector gauge boson ( dark photon )  a massive dark qed model .",
    "both the dark matter and the dark photon are singlets under the standard model gauge symmetries .",
    "the dark sector communicates with the standard model sector through the kinetic mixing term between the dark photon and the normal photon .",
    "th model is very simple and allows one to do concrete calculations of many observable quantities about the dark matter . over the recent years",
    ", it has been extensively studied in the literature for understanding various phenomena and experimental hints of dark matter , from the underground to the cosmos  @xcite .",
    "it also serves as an alternative to the supersymmetric wimp paradigm and can accommodate much more freedom in the relative importance of direct and indirect detections  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that the `` long '' range force nature due to a light dark photon exchange enables the dark matter to have large enough self - scattering cross section  @xcite to be a self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) candidate  @xcite .",
    "this allows it to provide an explanation to a few puzzles in the small scale structure formation such as the dwarf galaxy core / cusp and too - big - to - fail problems  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the experimental impact of the photon - dark - photon kinetic mixing has received tremendous interests .",
    "currently , an industry has formed utilizing the existing or building novel experiments to look for light and weakly - coupled new particles  @xcite .",
    "the goal of our work is the following .",
    "we will explore the possibility of having sizable dark matter self - interaction and at the same time having a sizable photon - dark - photon kinetic mixing so as to make the dark sector accessible to the laboratories .",
    "in other words , we want to ask the questions how visible a sidm candidate can be , and if visible enough what are the leading experimental channels for probing it .    before proceeding",
    ", we find a couple of clarifications of our motivation necessary .",
    "first , although sidm is quite an attractive scenario offering special correlations between the dark matter and dark photon masses ( especially when many other dark matter anomalies have faded away these days ) , there are still ongoing debates about to what extent the self - interaction is needed as the solution to the small - scale structure problems .",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite , which simply resorts to baryonic physics .",
    "the fate of sidm will eventually be dictated by more precise observations and simulations of dwarf galaxy formation . in this work",
    ", we would like to keep an open mind and consider a very wide range of dark matter self - interaction cross sections , instead of just the most preferred value for sidm .",
    "we expect our results to be more useful this way .",
    "second , one might argue that the laboratory detection of sidm is not guaranteed , because setting the photon - dark - photon kinetic mixing parameter to zero does not upset the sidm picture which involves only the dark sector interactions .",
    "there is nothing wrong with this argument .",
    "however , if it were the case , the dark sector would be totally decoupled from the standard model sector , and the only hope to further explore the nature of dark matter would be through astrophysical observations ( see , _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this is not the direction we would like to go here .",
    "for a pure - dirac fermion dark matter , shortly after the parameter space of sidm was obtained , it was pointed out that if the dark matter mass lies above a few gev , direct detection experiments place by far the strongest upper bound on the kinetic mixing parameter  @xcite , largely due to the small dark photon mass ( @xmath1mev ) required by sidm . for a ( sub-)gev scale sidm ,",
    "the direct detection limits are weaker and the low - energy high - intensity searches for dark photon and/or dark matter become more important . in this region , it has been pointed out that with a sufficiently large dark gauge coupling , the @xmath2-factories play the leading role in probing the sidm  @xcite .    on the other hand , because the dark photon is already massive in the model , it is allowed to introduce a majorana mass term to the dark matter .",
    "if the majorana mass is much smaller than the dirac mass , the dark matter becomes pseudo - dirac , _",
    "i.e. _ , the physical states are two majorana particles with a small mass splitting of order the majorana mass .",
    "assuming dark matter particles are all in the lighter state , the scattering of dark matter on nucleus target via a dark photon exchange at tree level has to convert it to the heavier state .",
    "if this mass splitting is much larger than the typical incoming kinetic energy in the center - of - mass frame , the up - scattering process simply can not happen and the strong direct detection constraints are evaded . at the same time , one has to worry what will happen to the sidm in the presence of such a mass splitting .",
    "naively , the dark matter self scattering with a tree - level dark photon exchange will also become up scattering from two lighter states to two heavier ones .",
    "if the kinetic energy is not large enough to compensate for the splitting , one may have to go to the next order and consider elastic scattering with two dark photon exchange ( a box diagram , see below ) . if this were the case",
    ", the expected self - interaction cross section would be much smaller than that for a pure - dirac dark matter .    as the main result of this work",
    ", our calculation reveals another key quantity , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the dark fine - structure constant and @xmath5 is the dark matter mass . unlike the direct detection process",
    ", the dark matter particle could gain a potential energy as large as @xmath3 during the low velocity ( @xmath6 ) self - scattering process .",
    "we find that if the available potential energy is large enough to compensate for the mass splitting , the up - scattering process becomes kinematically allowed within the potential well . in this case",
    ", the self - interaction cross section for a pseudo - dirac fermion dark matter is not suppressed and remains comparable to the pure - dirac fermion case .",
    "if we further increase the mass splitting beyond @xmath3 , the quantum mechanical effect stops being effective . as a result ,",
    "the up - scattering is forbidden everywhere and the dark matter self - interaction potential becomes genuinely loop suppressed . to maintain as large self scattering cross section",
    ", one must resort to much smaller dark photon mass .",
    "based on these observations , we derive the new parameter space for a pseudo - dirac sidm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the massive dark qed model and discuss the role of adding a small majorana mass to the dark matter in avoiding the strong direct detection constraints . in sections",
    "iii , iv , v , we describe our method of calculating the dark matter elastic self - scattering cross section at low velocities , taking into account of the non - perturbative effects .",
    "our numerical results are presented in section vi",
    ". we will conclude and outline several possible channels for probing the pseudo - dirac sidm in the future , in particular at high energy and intensity collider experiments .",
    "we note that the dark matter self - interaction in the presence of mass splitting has been explored in  @xcite , but their discussion focused on very small mass splitting less than @xmath7kev . in that case",
    "the inelastic scattering of dark matter in direct detection is still kinematically allowed and the constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter remain very strong .",
    "the impact of the mass splitting @xmath8 is less significant than what we shall show below .",
    "the lagrangian for the massive dark qed model is @xmath9 where in the limit @xmath10 the dirac fermion @xmath11 is the dark matter field , @xmath12 is the dark photon , @xmath13 is the dark gauge coupling ( @xmath14 will be the dark fine - structure constant ) and @xmath15 is the kinetic mixing between the photon and the vector field @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath0 kinetic mixing term can be removed at the price of redefining the photon field @xmath17 .",
    "this will result in an effective coupling between the dark photon and the usual electromagnetic current ( made of standard model particles ) , @xmath18 .",
    "turning on the majorana mass @xmath8 will split @xmath11 into two majorana fermion mass eigenstates , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the charge - conjugation of @xmath11 field . throughout the paper",
    "we assume that all the dark matter today are in the lighter state @xmath21 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath8 is real and much smaller than the dirac mass @xmath5 .",
    "the dark gauge interaction vertex becomes off - diagonal with respect to @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath23 as a result , the tree level scattering of dark matter @xmath21 on the proton target will convert it into the heavier state @xmath22 ( fig .",

    ", the dark matter velocity distribution is peaked at @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , for most targets the typical kinetic energy in the dark matter - nucleus system is at most a few hundred kev .",
    "if the @xmath25 mass difference @xmath8 is greater than an mev , the up - scattering process @xmath26 is kinematically forbidden and the tree - level direct detection constraint is simply evaded . at next order , one could consider elastic scattering @xmath27 happening at loop level with two dark photon exchange ( see right plot of fig .",
    "[ -1 ] ) , but that will cost an additional power of @xmath28 as well as the loop factor in the amplitude . given the existing upper limit on @xmath15 ( see fig .  4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , such a contribution can not lead to a competitive constraint .        adding a majorana dark matter mass will also generate a contribution to the dark photon mass at loop level , which is of order @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the cutoff scale where the dark @xmath0 is broken .",
    "this will not bring about unnaturalness as long as the dark photon bare mass satisfies @xmath31 .",
    "the main goal of this work is to calculate the cross section of dark matter self - interaction for a pseudo - dirac dark matter . because the dark matter velocity is much lower in dwarf galaxies ( @xmath32 ) than in the local dark matter wind ( @xmath33 ) , naively if the above mass splitting @xmath8 is large enough to forbid the up scattering in direct detection , the tree level up - scattering processes @xmath34 ( see the left plot in fig .  [ 0 ] )",
    "will also be kinematically forbidden .",
    "the next step seems to be considering @xmath35 scattering at loop level by integrating out @xmath22 , also shown in fig .",
    "however , this argument is only valid for very large mass splitting @xmath8 . in the @xmath36 limit ( pure dirac dark matter case )",
    ", the loop diagrams by themselves are not able to reproduce the leading yukawa potential , @xmath37 , but rather the @xmath38 order correction to it ( for such a calculation in real qed , see  @xcite ) . when @xmath8 is small enough for quantum mechanical effects to be important",
    ", we must keep the @xmath22 state in the calculation .        because we consider non - relativistic dark matter particle scatterings",
    ", it would greatly simplify the calculation by first going to the non - relativistic effective theory of the massive dark qed . according to the power counting in nrqed  @xcite ,",
    "the leading contributions are made from coulomb dark photon propagating in the loop .",
    "the radiative dark photon contributions are suppressed by the dark matter velocity at each vertex . including only coulomb dark photons",
    ", it is easiest to find that the diagrams ( b ) contribution vanishes because in the @xmath39 integral ( @xmath40 is the loop momentum ) , both poles of the integrand are located on the same side of the real axis .",
    "also , because the coulomb photon exchange must be instantaneous , the diagrams ( c , d ) will not contribute at leading order . only diagram ( a ) survives and the dominant contribution to the scattering amplitude is when the loop momentum @xmath40 is of same order as the total momentum transfer @xmath41 .",
    "this corresponds to each of the dark photon propagator only carrying a momentum much smaller than the dark matter mass scale @xmath42 and the two @xmath22 propagators are only off - shell by the amount of the momentum transfer @xmath43 or the mass difference @xmath8 .",
    "the low loop momentum dominance nature of the diagram justifies the use of schrdiger equation to resum the multiple coulomb dark photon exchange .",

    "we are interested in the question how visible the sidm from such a dark sector could be probed in our laboratories .",
    "previous calculations on sidm assumed it is a dirac fermion in which case the direct detection experiments are at the most frontier of probing the dirac sidm except for the low mass ( gev or less ) dark matter window . adding a small majorana mass to the dirac fermion dark matter",
    "will make it pseudo - dirac  split it into two nearly - degenerate majorana mass eigenstates , and if the mass splitting is larger than mev scale , all direct detection constraints can be evaded . at the same time ,",
    "as pointed out in this work , the parameter space for sidm will also be modified .",
    "the comparison between the mass splitting @xmath8 and the potential energy of order @xmath137 plays an important role in determining the viable parameter space of sidm .",
    "qualitatively , the parameter space for a pseudo - dirac self - interacting dark matter without direct detection constraints is @xmath138 , with @xmath139 being the local dark matter velocity .    the pseudo - dirac sidm case , with the strong direct detection constraints evaded , lights up new hopes of probing the photon - dark - photon kinetic mixing and the dark sector structure through other experiments .",
    "the most interesting parameter space is when the dark photon mass lies above @xmath140mev , where the current high intensity experimental upper bound on the kinetic mixing parameter @xmath15 is only @xmath141 , or even higher .",
    "thus the dark photon in the sidm scenario can still be quite visible with @xmath15 close to the present upper bound .",
    "there have been several proposals to cover the dark photon in this window  @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the mass spitting is large enough , according to fig .",
    "[ 3 ] and  [ 4 ] , the sidm mass is pushed up to around the weak scale .",
    "the high luminosity and future high energy colliders seem to be very suitable for probing both the sidm and dark photon in this case . at colliders",
    ", the dark matter particles @xmath142 could be pair - produced via the @xmath0 kinetic mixing , and dark photon could be radiated from dark matter final states or from the de - excitation of @xmath143 .",
    "they lead to exotic signatures such as lepton jets  @xcite and/or displaced vertices  @xcite . for large enough @xmath4 the dark matter bound state channels will also play an important role  @xcite .",
    "we leave a systematic study of these phenomena and their prospects to a future work  @xcite .",
    "finally , our work also could be useful when the kinetic mixing vanishes and the dark sector is completely hidden . in that case",
    ", there is no other option but to continue exploring the nature of dark matter in astrophysical observations .",
    "the new parameter space of pseudo - dirac sidm found here is still valid , and is complementary to that for a pure - dirac dark matter .",
