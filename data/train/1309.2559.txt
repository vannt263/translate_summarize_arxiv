    "one of the best ways to determine orbital parameters of extrasolar planets ( exoplanets ) is the transit method .",
    "particularly the _ kepler _ satellite , launched in 2009 , has executed successful transit observations , resulting in discovery of more than 3,500 planet candidates .",
    "it drastically increases the number of exoplanets we know and has found many multi - transiting planetary systems .",
    "the principal problem related to the transit method is a possibility of a false positive .",
    "a false positive in transit surveys means misidentifying a signal caused by an object other than a planet orbiting the target star as its true planetary companion . in transit surveys ,",
    "false positives are induced by some objects , for example eclipsing binaries , background transiting planetary systems or companions with transiting planets @xcite within photometric apertures of target stars .",
    "such objects reduce their brightness periodically , and total flux containing both from the target stars and from the mimicking objects consequently decreases periodically . since the presence of the false positive sources can not be verified only with the transit method , the depressions in light curves can not be translated directly into planets orbiting the targets , and follow - up observations are required to confirm that the depressions are really caused by planets .",
    "although most of _ kepler _ planetary candidates are waiting to be confirmed , false positive rates reported by spectroscopic follow - up observations ( @xcite ; @xmath3% ) and other planet surveys ( e.g. hat - net ; @xcite ) are significantly higher than the rates for _ kepler _ candidates theoretically expected by @xcite ( less than 5% for over half targets ) and @xcite ( @xmath4% for whole targets ) based on galactic models .",
    "the inconsistency has not been elucidated yet , and therefore , suggests that _ kepler _ candidates are required to be confirmed with other manners , including the radial velocity method , ttvs @xcite , the centroid analysis @xcite , blender analysis @xcite , and the direct imaging observations .",
    "many follow - up observations with the direct imaging method have been executed so far , but most observations were too shallow to confirm candidates efficiently .",
    "for example , let us assume that there is a false positive source within the target star s photometric aperture with the magnitude of @xmath5 mag compared to the target .",
    "a full occultation of the source induces a depression with the depth of 100 ppm , which is a typical value caused by an earth - like planet transiting a sun - like star .",
    "a false positive source with a smaller contrast ( @xmath6 ) can cause the 100 ppm depression by its partial occultation , while a source with a larger contrast ( @xmath7 ) can induce a shallower depression .",
    "thus , if a depression with the depth of 100 ppm is detected , direct imaging observations with a contrast of @xmath5 mag can fully and efficiently put a constraint on the possibility of a false positive .",
    "however , some studies employ direct imaging with a detection limit of @xmath6 mag for confirming a transit detection with the depth of @xmath8 ppm ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such shallow observations can not fully reject false positive sources .",
    "moreover , if a companion candidate is found around the target by the direct imaging , we can evaluate gravitational influences upon the orbital migrations of the planetary system by the companion .",
    "we focus on koi-94 , which was listed on the earliest _ kepler _ object of interest ( koi ) list @xcite .",
    "koi-94 is a relatively faint  @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 ( 2mass ; @xcite )  late f - type star with the age of @xmath11 gyr @xcite or @xmath12 gyr @xcite .",
    "this system has four planet candidates named as koi-94.01 , 02 , 03 and 04 , which are also known as koi-94 d , c , e and b , respectively ( properties listed on table [ tbl-1 ] ) . @xcite discovered the ",
    "planet - planet eclipse \" phenomenon in the light curves , where the term means that a planet occults another planet transiting their host star at that time . combining the event with measurements of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect @xcite of koi-94.01",
    ", they confirmed that koi-94.01 and 03 , at least , are real planets and showed that orbital axes of koi-94.01 and 03 and the spin axis of the main star koi-94 are well aligned .",
    "the fact suggests that the planets have not experienced the planet - planet scattering ( e.g. @xcite ) or the kozai migration ( e.g. @xcite ) . in contrast , a boundness of koi-94.02 and 04 remains unclear ; radial velocities observed by @xcite represented so low amplitudes that they could detect 04 only at a @xmath13 significance and 02 at the same level of non - detection , and their direct imaging observations had shallow depths ( @xmath14 at 05 , 5.9 at @xmath15 ) in spite of the depth of koi-94.04 ( 131 ppm ) .",
    "hence , deeper direct imaging observations for koi-94 are required to confirm detections of the candidates .    in this paper , we present results of high - contrast direct imaging observations for koi-94 and elucidate the presence of a faint object around the star .",
    "details of the direct imaging observations and discussion based on the observations are described in section [ imaging - obs ] and [ discussion - di ] , respectively .",
    "we then show our results and discussion of reduced light curves of planetary candidates koi-94.04 in section [ discussion - lc ] .",
    "section [ summary ] summarizes the paper .",
    "in employing the direct imaging observations , we first estimate the distance of koi-94 from the earth .",
    "given koi-94 s magnitudes of @xmath16 ( _ kepler _ input catalog ) and metallicity of @xmath17}=+0.0228\\pm0.0020 $ ] @xcite for koi-94 , we can infer its @xmath18-band absolute magnitude @xmath19 according to equation 1 in @xcite , who developed the galactic model .",
    "a comparison between the @xmath20 and an observed magnitude of @xmath21 ( _ kepler _ input catalog ) for koi-94 enables us to estimate its distance to be @xmath22 pc . on the other hand , by applying an koi-94 s estimated mass of @xmath23 @xcite to yonsei - yale isochrone model @xcite , we calculate @xmath24 , which can be compared with @xmath25-band magnitude of koi-94 @xmath26 ( nomad catalogue ; @xcite ) to infer the distance of @xmath27 pc . the accurate distance does not matter for our following discussions , and we therefore adopt the average of both estimations , @xmath28 pc , in this study .    in order to check the presence of possible false positive sources , we observed the star as a part of the seeds project @xcite .",
    "the seeds has directly imaged stellar companions that are the important clue to the origin of close - in exoplanets @xcite , as well as substellar or planetary companions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath0 band images using a high - contrast near - infrared camera hiciao @xcite with a 188 actuators adaptive optics system ( ao188 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the detector of hiciao consists of 2048@xmath292048 pixels with the plate scale of 9.5 mas / pixel , and has the field of view ( fov ) of about @xmath30 .",
    "the observations were performed on 2012 july 10 , where we employed angular differential imaging ( adi ; @xcite ) to remove the starlight and the stellar speckles .",
    "the sky was photometric , and the typical full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of our observed psfs was @xmath3115.4 pixels ( @xmath32 ) after ao corrections .",
    "we obtained 35 images , of which all frames were adequate for high - contrast science .",
    "individual integration times were 15 seconds and 3 coadds per image were taken ( i.e. each image has an integration time of 45 seconds ) . thus our observations allow for the cumulative integration time of 26 minutes , where the field rotation through adi observations was 13.9 degrees in total .",
    "we note that the observations were performed without an occulting mask and array saturation , which allow us to carefully calibrate the acquired data sets .    for the first attempt in data reductions",
    ", we plainly combined all frames after derotating them and subtracting halos from them , but spider noises and speckle noises prevented us from discussing the presence of faint objects around the target star .",
    "we then employed the locally optimized combination of images ( loci ) algorithm @xcite in order to remove the noises .",
    "as a result , we detect a faint object ( hereafter koi-94 b , or b for short ) at a separation of @xmath33 from koi-94 ( see figure [ fig - image ] ) , regardless of the fact that @xcite did not find the object with ao direct imaging observations using mmt / aries and the speckle imaging observations using dssi camera on the wiyn 3.5 m telescope .",
    "this is the first discovery of a false positive source candidate around koi-94 .",
    "the loci processing is powerful method for high - contrast data reductions , but it may not be efficient in the case of small field rotations as our observations for koi-94 because of the serious self - subtraction problem , though some new techniques have been developed for avoiding the self - subtraction ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we simply attempted to apply the classical adi @xcite data processing to the images , after subtracting the halos of koi-94 psfs on each frame .",
    "indeed , this additional attempt improved the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of koi-94 b. a final image made by combining all frames reduced with the classical adi analysis and its 5@xmath34 contrast curve are shown in figure [ fig - image ] and [ fig - contrast ] , respectively .",
    "we can easily find the faint star in figure [ fig - image ] at the position with a separation of @xmath35 to the north ( pa@xmath36 ) from the central star .",
    "figure [ fig - contrast ] shows that our deep high contrast imaging ( the red line ) reaches @xmath37 at @xmath38 and @xmath39 at @xmath15 , enabling us to detect b ( shown by the green circle ) , in contrast to the shallow detection limits by @xcite ( the blue arrows ) .",
    "the brightness of b was obtained from the aperture photometry relative to the central star ( @xmath10 ) , and compensated for the self - subtraction induced by the adi analysis with estimates from measuring fluxes of artificial signals embedded in the science frames .",
    "its photometric error is attributed mainly to the uncertainties of the estimates .",
    "although the arrows are based on their brief descriptions of the detection limits in @xmath40 band , the difference of wavelengths does not affect the discussion as long as b has a moderate color of @xmath41 .",
    "the depths of koi-94.02 and 04 in @xmath42 band are also represented in figure [ fig - contrast ] as the dotted lines , because we can directly compare them with b s contrast in @xmath0 band under condition that the transit depths are constant in various wavelengths .",
    "properties of koi-94 b are summarized in table [ tbl-2 ] in detail .    under an assumption that koi-94 b is a single star with the same distance as that of koi-94 ( @xmath43 pc ) , our measured magnitude , @xmath44 , for koi-94",
    "can be converted into an absolute magnitude of @xmath45 , which can be compared with 3 - 4 gyr isochrones in nextgen model @xcite to infer a mass of @xmath46 for b. the measured projected separation of b ( @xmath47 ) corresponds to @xmath48 au at the assumed distance .",
    "in this section , we examine influences from the companion candidate b found with the direct imaging .",
    "first of all , we note that b does not correspond to any of the reported four planets orbiting koi-94 .",
    "this is because it is unrealistic that a planet with the separation of @xmath48 au ( see section 2 ) orbits the sun - like star with the period of less than 54 days , the longest value in the koi-94 system . since the most important",
    "fact is that the candidate b is within the _ kepler _ photometric aperture ( typically a few arcsecs ) , we discuss influences for all hypotheses upon the light curves of koi-94 in this section . among the depressions of koi-94 , because we know that koi-94.01 and 03 are real planets transiting koi-94 @xcite ,",
    "only koi-94.02 and 04 are to be discussed .",
    "the following cases can cause depressions in the light curves of koi-94.02 or 04 ; ( 1 ) a real planet transiting the central star koi-94 , ( 2 ) a real planet transiting the companion b , and ( 3 ) b being an eclipsing binary . in case of ( 1 ) , b can not affect estimates of stellar and planetary parameters from the light curves seriously , because b is much fainter than the central star . in cases of ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ,",
    "whether b is bound or not to the central star koi-94 does not become a serious issue .",
    "if ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) is true , planet candidates of koi-94.02 or 04 may not be a real planet orbiting koi-94 .",
    "these hypotheses about koi-94.02 are examined and concluded in the following paragraphs based on the direct imaging observations .",
    "the hypotheses ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) about koi-94.04 are precisely discussed in  3.2 in addition to this subsection , while the hypothesis ( 1 ) about it is argued in  4.2 grounded on our light curve reanalyses (  4.1 ) .",
    "considering an extreme case that the companion candidate is completely occulted , the brightness of b can be translated into upper limit for the depth of depression induced by b. then if the upper limit is shallower than the transit depth of koi-94.02 or 04 , it is impossible that koi-94.02 or 04 is orbiting the companion candidate , i.e. , it is a real planet transiting the central star . in order to estimate b s _ kepler _ magnitude from our @xmath0 band magnitude and directly compare it with the depths of the depressions of the planetary candidates in @xmath42 band on the koi catalogue , we adopt the following analyses .    first , if b is physically bound to koi-94 and a single star , b s mass should be @xmath49 ( see section 2 ) and we can then calculate its apparent brightness in @xmath42 band to be @xmath50 using estimated absolute magnitudes of @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite from the observed magnitude in @xmath0 band and the equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath18 are apparent magnitudes for an apparent @xmath42 magnitude .",
    "consequently we obtain @xmath55 , corresponding to a contrast of @xmath56 in @xmath42 band .",
    "the contrast , which means an upper limit , is too small to explain the depths of koi-94.02 ( @xmath57 ) or 04 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "therefore , in this case , hypothesis ( 2 ) is ruled out .",
    "simultaneously , the hypothesis ( 3 ) that b is an eclipsing binary bound to koi-94 can be discussed . because each component of the binary would be fainter than the single m star ,",
    "the binary would consist of later type stars than the above estimate .",
    "the later stars can produce shallower depressions in the light curves , and thus the hypothesis ( 3 ) is also excluded .",
    "next we investigate the situation that b is not bound to koi-94 . in this case",
    ", the b s color can not be constrained from our measured @xmath0-band magnitude and the theoretical evolutionary trucks , since it is sufficiently possible that b has the distance and age different from those of koi-94 .",
    "thus we are not able to directly estimate the @xmath42 magnitude .",
    "we employ statistical discussions to estimate it based on @xcite , who compared _ kepler _ input catalogue with 2mass catalogue and derived empirical relationships between infrared magnitudes and @xmath42 magnitudes of stars in the _ kepler _ field .",
    "since they did not indicate @xmath42-@xmath0 relationship , we substitute our @xmath0 magnitude into @xmath59 and @xmath40 magnitudes in their equations in order to obtain a rough estimate of b s @xmath42 magnitude .",
    "then we acquire @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath42-@xmath59 and @xmath42-@xmath40 relationships , respectively .",
    "since the magnitude of koi-94 central star is @xmath9 , the contrasts are @xmath62 or 9.3 .",
    "these contrasts correspond to flux ratios of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively . comparing them with the depth of koi-94.02 ( @xmath65 )",
    ", we suggest that it is difficult to regard koi-94.02 as a planet transiting b or a false positive induced by b ; in other words , an extreme case that b is completely occulted can explain the depth of koi-94.02 . on the other hand , the possibility that koi-94.04 ( @xmath66 ) is a false positive can not be excluded by comparing b s magnitude and its depth .",
    "hence we conclude that koi-94.02 is a real planet orbiting koi-94 , assuming the typical color of stars in the field , and discuss koi-94.04 s nature in the following sections .      in this subsection ,",
    "we assume koi-94.04 as a false positive .",
    "first we examine the hypothesis ( 2 ) that the planetary candidate orbits b. because the assumption that the companion b is physically bound to the central star is rejected in ",
    "[ imaging - discussion ] , we here assume the companion candidate to be a background star .    comparing the depth of planetary candidate koi-94.04 of @xmath58 with the contrast of b of @xmath67 in @xmath42 band ( see  3.1 ) , a ratio of their radii is @xmath68 , if any light from koi-94.04 is neglected .",
    "the estimation of @xmath69/r@xmath70 can constrain the radius of koi-94.04 . if b has a radius larger than @xmath71",
    ", the ratio leads to @xmath72 ; an exoplanet with a radius larger than 2.1 @xmath73 has not been discovered so far ( @xcite , see also exoplanets.org ) . considering the estimate of @xmath74 and the observational knowledge cumulative for exoplanet properties",
    ", we can suggest that a star with a radius of @xmath75 can hardly explain the depressions for koi-94.04 .",
    "note , however , an object with @xmath76 can account for our estimated @xmath74 .",
    "obtaining a spectral type of b and determining its radius by future observations are important for investigating the possibility of the hypothesis ( 2 ) .",
    "secondly we investigate the hypothesis ( 3 ) that the companion candidate b is a binary .",
    "b s contrast in @xmath42 band and the depth of koi-94.04 are the same as those in the above situation . if the amount of b s fluxes decreases by 20 - 70% via the eclipse in the system",
    ", the depth can be explained , and thus the possibility of b being a binary is not rejected .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite calculated the probability of false positive with a given _ kepler _ transit depth , leading to the estimated false positive rate of @xmath77% for koi-94.04 in combination of their calculations .",
    "consequently , the possibility of a false positive remains for koi-94.04 .",
    "if the secondary eclipses of koi-94.04 is detected , it becomes strong evidence supporting koi-94.04 as an eclipsing binary .",
    "however , we did not find a significant secondary eclipse in the following light curve analyses .",
    "thus the possibility that koi-94.04 is a planet ( i.e. the hypothesis ( 1 ) ) remains , which is discussed in the next section .",
    "because we can not fully exclude the possibility that koi-94.04 is a false positive even with the new direct imaging observations , we investigate the possibility of koi-94.04 being a real planet by revisiting the koi-94.04 transit light curves .",
    " 4.1 shows our reductions and results , and we discuss the possibility in  4.2 based on  4.1 .",
    "we here employ _ kepler _",
    "s public data sets @xcite of quarter 1 through quarter 13 . in order to detect koi-94.04 in the light curves ,",
    "we first remove trends on the curves by fitting polynomial functions with masking transit depressions .",
    "second we fold the curves by koi-94.04 s period on the koi catalogue ( 3.743245 days in @xcite ) .",
    "third we bin the folded light curves into thousand data points .",
    "errors of the binned points are based on the scatter of the data points in each bin . as a result",
    ", we see a depression of koi-94.04 .",
    "the shape of phase - folded transit light curve looks asymmetric , suggesting that the fiducial period may be incorrect .",
    "therefore , we systematically changed its period from the catalogued value with shifts in unit of its error ( 0.000031 days ) to find a symmetric transit light curve , because a folded transit light curve with an exact period would give a symmetric curve .",
    "figure [ fig - lightcurve ] shows three light curves with various periods and their best fit model curves .",
    "the @xmath78 light curve ( i.e. @xmath79 days ) gives the most symmetric light curve .",
    "we adopt transit model by @xcite , which uses the quadratic limb - darkening law , defined as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the intensity and @xmath82 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the line from the stellar center to the position of the stellar surface . in order to quantify their symmetricities",
    ", we measured a @xmath83 parameter obtained by fitting a transit model function to the curves . here",
    ", the @xmath83 parameter is expressed as @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the @xmath87-th modeled and observed relative flux data , and @xmath88 is its error . the curves other than @xmath78 shifted data sets resulted in the higher @xmath83 parameters .",
    "in addition to @xmath83 , limb - darkening parameter @xmath89 and their radial ratio between the planet candidate koi-94.04 and its host star koi-94 , @xmath90 , are depicted in figure [ fig - chi2 ] as a function of time shift . in the reduction",
    ", we fixed the other limb - darkening parameter @xmath91 at 0.40 ( masuda et al . in prep . ) and see the variation of the best - fit @xmath89 value .",
    "the light curve shifted by @xmath78 ( the red dots and line in figure [ fig - lightcurve ] ) indicates the smallest @xmath83 value in our grid survey ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig - chi2 ] ) , which means 3.743186 days gives the best for its period .",
    "the corresponding @xmath89 and @xmath90 are @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "this estimate of @xmath89 is especially used for the confirmation of planetary candidate koi94.04 in the following section .",
    "in contrast to  [ discussion - fp ] , we investigate the possibility of koi-94.04 as a real planet orbiting koi-94  the hypothesis ( 1 ) . @xcite conducted spectroscopic observations with keck / hires , putting limits on the masses of koi-94.02 and 04 .",
    "they showed koi-94.04 s period of 3.74 days , scaled semi - major axis of @xmath94 , eccentricity of @xmath95 , radius of @xmath96 , and mass of @xmath97 .",
    "surprisingly , the radius and the mass lead to an extraordinarily high density of @xmath98 . also , they determined that koi-94.02 has a period of 10.42 days and eccentricity of @xmath99 .",
    "meanwhile , according to their orbital stability analysis , 80% of the random simulations with eccentric orbits reached close encounters between koi-94.04 and koi-94.02 .",
    "namely eccentric orbits typically become dynamically unstable in the koi-94 system in their analysis , and they therefore suggested that the planets should have circular orbits to keep the system dynamically stable .",
    "nevertheless their radial velocity data support the eccentric orbits for koi-94.02 and 04 .",
    "this inconsistency allows us to consider the mass or eccentricity estimate for koi94.02 or 04 possibly inaccurate .",
    "furthermore , though @xcite also showed ttvs in the koi-94 system , the ttv of koi-94.04 was not discussed in their ttv analysis .",
    "hence , the possibility that koi94.04 is a false positive can not be ruled out by the discussions of @xcite .",
    "our limb - darkening analyses also enable us to discuss whether the planetary candidates orbiting the same host star or not by comparing them .",
    "our analyses show that the limb darkening parameter @xmath89 for the @xmath78 shifted data ( i.e. the lowest @xmath83 ) is @xmath100 , under the condition that the @xmath91 parameter is fixed at 0.40 .",
    "our values of @xmath91 and @xmath89 are consistent with those of koi-94.01 , 02 and 03 reported by masuda et al .",
    "( in prep ; @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) , who analyzed @xmath91 and @xmath89 simultaneously as free parameters .",
    "the consistency supports that koi-94.04 is orbiting the same host star .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath89 parameter of the data sets phase - folded with the catalogued period ( i.e. @xmath103 ) is @xmath104 , which is inconsistent with those of the other planets .",
    "the discrepancy implies koi-94.04 does not transit koi-94 , but its @xmath83 parameter is worse than that of @xmath78 data sets .",
    "the @xmath83 parameter suggests that true koi-94.04 s period may not be the value on the catalogue but slightly shifted ( our result @xmath105 days is compatible with that of @xcite , @xmath106 days ) , and koi-94.04 is a possible planet orbiting koi-94 based on the limb - darkening parameters .",
    "although the results are still imperfect for the confirmation , the discussions in this section contribute to improving the limits on the possibility of a false positive of koi-94.04 .",
    "apart from the problem of false positives for koi-94 , b may induce gravitational interaction with the planets in the system under the assumption that b is physically bound to koi-94 .",
    "the interaction can make the planets migrate and intersect their orbits , leading the system unstable .",
    "we have focused on the multiple planetary system koi-94 and conducted high - contrast direct imaging observations with subaru / hiciao in order to examine a possibility of false positives . as a result of our classical adi analysis , we have discovered a faint object at a separation of 0.6 arcsecs with a contrast of @xmath107 to the north .",
    "our estimates of its magnitude in @xmath42 revealed that the insubstantial binary in the background can explain the depths of koi-94.04 as a false positive .",
    "we have also excluded the possibility of a false positive of koi-94.02 because the depths of koi-94.02 is almost equal to or larger than the contrast of the faint object , assuming the companion candidate being a real companion or a background star with the typical color . on the other hand ,",
    "our transit analyses show the limb darkening parameter of koi-94.04 is consistent with those of the other planetary candidates in the koi-94 system , suggesting that koi-94.04 might orbit the same host star .",
    "although we can not conclude that koi-94.04 is a planet from our results , we have demonstrated that the combination of the direct imaging and analysis of transit light curve can constrain the possibility of a false positive .",
    "our results also suggest that it is not enough to conclude the possibility of false positives by shallow or low - contrast direct imaging observations , which have been often conducted so far .",
    "considering the fact that @xcite failed to find the companion candidate b due to their detection limits , our results suggest to require deep observations with @xmath108 mag at a few arcsecs for the confirmation of a planet with its transit depth of @xmath109 ppm rather than conventional and shallow observations for excluding false positives .",
    "furthermore , the discovery of the companion candidate b , if confirmed to be bound , gives an important clue to dynamical evolution of the planets in the koi-94 system .",

    "<S> we report a discovery of a companion candidate around one of _ kepler _ objects of interest ( kois ) , koi-94 , and results of our quantitative investigation of the possibility that planetary candidates around koi-94 are false positives . </S>",
    "<S> koi-94 has a planetary system in which four planetary detections have been reported by _ </S>",
    "<S> kepler _ , suggesting that this system is intriguing to study the dynamical evolutions of planets . </S>",
    "<S> however , while two of those detections ( koi-94.01 and 03 ) have been made robust by previous observations , the others ( koi-94.02 and 04 ) are marginal detections , for which future confirmations with various techniques are required . </S>",
    "<S> we have conducted high - contrast direct imaging observations with subaru / hiciao in @xmath0 band and detected a faint object located at a separation of @xmath1 from koi-94 . </S>",
    "<S> the object has a contrast of @xmath2 in @xmath0 band , and corresponds to an m type star on the assumption that the object is at the same distance of koi-94 . </S>",
    "<S> based on our analysis , koi-94.02 is likely to be a real planet because of its transit depth , while koi-94.04 can be a false positive due to the companion candidate . </S>",
    "<S> the success in detecting the companion candidate suggests that high - contrast direct imaging observations are important keys to examine false positives of kois . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> our transit light curve reanalyses lead to a better period estimate of koi-94.04 than that on the koi catalogue and show that the planetary candidate has the same limb darkening parameter value as the other planetary candidates in the koi-94 system , suggesting that koi-94.04 is also a real planet in the system . </S>"
