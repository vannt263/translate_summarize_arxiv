    "2007 ) as a 9@xmath2 object on february 4.85 ut , v1280 sco underwent rapid brightening and eventually reached optical maximum brightness at @xmath3 on february @xmath4 , and remained so for around three days afterwards .",
    "subsequently it gradually faded and is currently back on its original brightness at @xmath5 .",
    "henden & munari ( 2007 ) reported its position as @xmath6 .",
    "11. the nova is the brightest star on the image ( marked ) , while the second brightest is sao 208228 .",
    "integration time was 20 seconds . ]",
    "our observations were carried out at the bosscha observatory , during late february 2007 . due to weather restrictions and observing time availability",
    ", we managed to cover only three nights for spectroscopy and one night for photometry .    on february 13.9 ut",
    "we performed a `` snapshot '' _ bvri _ photometry on the object , using a celestron 11 \" f/10 schmidt - cassegrain mounted with sbig st-8xme ccd ( 1530 @xmath7 1020 px , 9@xmath8 pixelsize ) . the nearby 7@xmath2 star sao 208228 , which was on the same ccd field with v1280 sco , was used as a comparison star ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations were carried out on february 16.9 , 24.9 , and 28.9 ut .",
    "we used an sbig dss-7 spectrograph combined with the celestron 11 `` and st-8xme ( february 16@xmath9 ) , while on february 24@xmath9 and 28@xmath9 the spectrograph was combined with a celestron 8 '' f/10 schmidt - cassegrain and sbig st-7xme - s ccd ( 765 @xmath7 510 px , 9@xmath8 pixelsize ) . due to the absence of internal wavelength comparison source in the spectrograph , we used external sources i.e. skyglow , an hg lamp , hr 5511 , and arcturus ( radial velocity standard star , udry et al .",
    "we used high resolution spectral atlas of arcturus from hinkle et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the combination of our instruments gave a resolution of 5.4  per pixel .",
    "effective wavelength coverage was from 3800 to 8000  . throughout the observations the ccd camera",
    "was cooled down to @xmath1010 c. integration time was 10 to 20 seconds .",
    "typical sky condition was clear , but not photometric since there were scattered clouds present .",
    "during our 1-hour observing session , we obtained 15 science images for each _ bvri _ band , in addition to dark and flatfield frames .",
    "standard reduction of dark - subtracting and flatfielding was employed .",
    "we than carried out aperture photometry to both object and comparison on the reduced images using iraf / apphot package .        to determine the zero - point of photometry",
    ", we refer the _ b _ and _ v _ magnitudes of sao 208228 to the magnitudes from the sao catalogue .",
    "this zero - point was then applied to the instrumental magnitudes of v1280 sco to transform it into standard magnitudes .",
    "averaging from the 15 frames yielded magnitudes in _ b _ = 6.400 @xmath11 0.041 and _ v _ = 6.011 @xmath11 0.027 .",
    "this result is quite in concordance compared to american amateur variable star observer ( aavso ) database ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "r _ and _ i _ magnitudes were calculated by assuming @xmath12 = 0.08 and @xmath13 = 0.01 @xcite for sao 208228 , an a2 star .",

    "our spectra were dark - subtracted and flatfield - corrected using iraf .",

    "24 spectra were not calibrated since no standard star was observed during the night .",
    "the fluxes of feb 16 and feb 28 spectra were calibrated using hr 5511 and arcturus , respectively .",

    "28 spectra .",
    "measurements to absorption profile were carried out by fitting the profile with a voigt function , while we used a gaussian function on the emission component . during the fitting , the base of the fitting function was set at the continuum .    to derive radial velocity @xmath17 for each na i d line component from observed wavelength @xmath18 given the rest wavelength @xmath19 and speed of light @xmath20",
    ", we used the doppler relationship @xmath21    radial velocity derived from this measurement was corrected to radial heliocentric velocity @xmath22 .",
    "the difference between radial heliocentric velocities of absorption and emission component , i.e. basically difference of wavelength @xmath23 , yields expansion velocity @xmath24 .",
    "measurements of three spectra yielded shell expansion velocity as 1567.43 @xmath11 174.14 km s@xmath25 ( table [ table ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table ]",
    "using the relationship developed by della valle & livio ( 1995 ) , we were able to crudely approximate the absolute magnitude of the nova .",
    "v1280 sco took @xmath26 @xmath27 11 days , i.e. time to decline 2@xmath2 from maximum brightness .",
    "this decline rate was translated to maximum absolute magnitude @xmath28 = @xmath108.63 .",
    "interstellar extinction map of neckel & klare ( 1980 ) indicates that the amount of extinction in the general direction of v1280 sco ( @xmath29 = 351.756@xmath30 , @xmath31 = + 0.120@xmath30 ) is @xmath32 @xmath33 2@xmath2 . applying @xmath32 = 2@xmath2 , and maximum brightness of @xmath34 = 3.7@xmath2 , we estimate the distance of the nova as 1.2 kpc .",
    "this corresponds to a small vertical distance of the object to the galactic plane , 2.5 pc .    using [",
    "o i ] lines at @xmath355577 , 6300 , 6364 we estimated several physical parameters of v1280 sco .",
    "as described in ederoclite et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the optical depth of @xmath166300 line can be calculated from the equation @xmath36 we found that the value of @xmath37 is 5.4 , which we used to derive electron temperatures of the ejecta region where [ o i ] lines originated using equation @xmath38 the above equation yield @xmath39 k. this enabled us to estimate the oxygen mass in the ejecta , in solar mass ( @xmath40 ) : @xmath41 taking the total - to - selective absorption ratio @xmath42 , corresponding to @xmath43 , we found that the oxygen mass in the ejecta is in the order of @xmath44 .",
    "this result , along with the value of @xmath37 and @xmath45 , is in accordance with the values derived from other novae ( c.f .",
    "ederoclite et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "according to the rate of brightness drop , v1280 sco was classified as a fast nova , which has a typical @xmath26 of less than 12 days ( della valle & livio 1998 ) .",
    "the derived maximum absolute magnitude and shell expansion velocity were consistent with that of typical fast novae ( gallagher & starrfield 1978 , osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the spectrum of the nova resembles a `` fe ii '' type nova spectrum , described in williams ( 1992 ) .",
    "we classified v1280 sco then as a fast fe ii - type nova . according to della valle & livio ( 1998 ) , the progenitor of this type of nova originated from a relatively old population i of thin disk / spiral arm and the associated white dwarf is rather massive with mass between 0.9 and 1 @xmath46 .",
