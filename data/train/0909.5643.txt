    "there are currently major experimental efforts for direct and indirect detection of the dark matter particle .",
    "the indirect detection investigates astrophysical effects of dark matter annihilation in the galaxy , including signatures in the cosmic rays .",
    "the recently published results by pamela experiment show an excess of positron flux at energies above 10  gev  @xcite , while no excess of anti - proton flux is observed  @xcite .",
    "another cosmic ray experiment called atic ( a balloon experiment ) has also recently published data where one observes an excess in the @xmath3 spectrum with a peak around 600  gev  @xcite . however , the latest results from the fermi  @xcite and h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite experiments do not confirm the peak at the high energies reported by atic .    while there could be astrophysical explanations for these anomalies ( e.g. from nearby pulsars  @xcite ) ,",
    "it is reasonable to ask whether they can be attributed to the effect of dark matter annihilation in the galaxy . barring a large astrophysical boost factor @xmath4 , which might be difficult to obtain based on recent analysis of halo substructure  @xcite , a dark matter explanation requires an annihilation cross section much larger than the the canonical value @xmath5",
    "@xmath6/s  @xcite and dominantly leptonic final states  @xcite .",
    "this can not be achieved for the neutralino dark matter in the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model .",
    "there have been proposals for new dark matter models  @xcite in which the dark matter candidate belongs to a hidden sector , and an acceptable thermal relic density is obtained via new gauge interactions .",
    "the key ideas of these models are that the dark matter annihilation today is enhanced by a sommerfeld effect  @xcite due to the existence of light bosons and that annihilation mainly produces lepton final states via symmetry of the hidden sector .    here",
    "we consider an explicit model where dark matter belongs to the visible sector and can explain the positron excess .",
    "it is based on a simple extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) that includes a gauged @xmath0 , with the right - handed ( rh ) sneutrino being the dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 extension of the mssm  @xcite is well motivated since it automatically implies the existence of three rh neutrinos through which one can explain the neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "the minimal model contains a new gauge boson @xmath7 , two new higgs fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the rh neutrinos @xmath10 , and their supersymmetric partners .",
    "the superpotential is ( the boldface characters denote superfields ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the superfields containing the higgs field that gives mass to up - type quarks and the left - handed ( lh ) leptons respectively . for simplicity",
    ", we have omitted the family indices .",
    "the @xmath14 term contains @xmath15 , @xmath16 and its detailed form depends on the charge assignments of the new higgs fields .",
    "the last term on the rh side of eq .",
    "( [ sup ] ) is the neutrino yukawa coupling term .",
    "the @xmath0 is broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which we denote by @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "this results in a mass @xmath19 for the @xmath7 gauge boson . here",
    "@xmath20 is the gauge coupling of @xmath0 , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the @xmath1 charges of @xmath23 respectively .",
    "we have three physical higgs fields @xmath24 ( scalars ) and @xmath25 ( a pseudo scalar ) .",
    "the scalar higgses are related to the real parts of @xmath23 through the mixing angle @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 represent the imaginary parts .",
    "the masses of the higgs fields follow @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .    a natural dark matter candidate in this model",
    "is the sneutrino @xmath32  .",
    "the main processes for annihilation of dark matter quanta are then governed by the @xmath33-term contribution to the scalar potential  @xcite , with the dominant mode being @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 subsequently decays into fermion - antifermion pairs via a one - loop diagram containing two @xmath7 bosons .",
    "the decay rate is given by : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the @xmath1 charges of the final state fermion and the @xmath35 respectively , @xmath39 is the fermion mass , and @xmath40 denotes color factor . since the @xmath1 charge of leptons is three times larger than that of quarks , the leptonic branching ratio is naturally larger than that for quarks . for @xmath41 , we can have @xmath42 . if @xmath43 , the dominant decay mode is @xmath44 final state , while the branching ratio for the @xmath45 mode is @xmath46 times smaller .",
    "the annihilation cross section at the present time has sommerfeld enhancement as a result of the attractive force between sneutrinos due to the @xmath35 exchange that leads to an attractive potential @xmath47 in the non - relativistic limit  @xcite , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the sneutrino mass .",
    "as an explicit example , we choose the @xmath1 charge for @xmath50 ( i.e. @xmath51 ) to be @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath1 charges of quarks and leptons are chosen to be @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "we use reasonable values for the model parameters , i.e. , @xmath55 , @xmath56  tev , @xmath57  tev ( @xmath58 being the higgs mixing parameter in the @xmath1 sector ) , soft masses for the higgs fields @xmath59  gev , and soft gaugino mass @xmath60  tev . the @xmath7 mass used in the calculation obeys the lep and tevatron bounds  @xcite for our charge assignments .",
    "the sneutrino mass is chosen to be between 800 gev and 2 tev in order to explain the pamela data .",
    "we use darksusy-5.0.2  @xcite to calculate the positron flux from dark matter annihilation .",
    "each pair annihilation in our model produces 2 @xmath35 s that yield four fermions upon their decay . for this reason",
    ", we generally need a heavier sneutrino compared to models in which the pair annihilation directly produces fermions .",
    "we normalize the positron fraction by a factor @xmath61 according to  @xcite . here",
    "we assume nfw profile  @xcite for the dark matter halo and med parameters for the propagation as defined in  @xcite .    in figure",

    "we found that with an enhancement factor of @xmath65 the chi - square values ( including only points with energy greater than 10  gev ) for a sneutrino mass of 1.5  tev are small , i.e. 2.9 and 5.5 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "we can raise @xmath66 up to @xmath67  gev and still have acceptable anti - proton flux . also , we find that for @xmath63 final state the @xmath68 spectrum at higher energies is compatible with the recent results from fermi satellite .",

    "in our model the elastic scattering of the sneutrino occurs via the @xmath7 exchange with the nucleus in the @xmath69-channel .",
