    "the origin of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxrb ) is of considerable interest due to possible ramifications on the properties of the various classes of sources that contribute to it , such as clusters and other extragalactic sources . by estimating their cxrb contributions and accounting for galactic absorption we can compare with measurements of the observed x - ray background ( xrb ) . since the discovery of the xrb ( giacconi et al .",
    "1962 ) significant effort has been devoted to spectrally mapping the emission at energies in the range @xmath3 kev .",
    "the radiation has a power - law form with a spectral index of @xmath4 above @xmath5 kev ; the spectrum @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the spectral intensity , peaks at @xmath8 kev and decreases exponentially at higher energies .",
    "substantial uncertainties in the measurement of @xmath7 are due to cross - calibration uncertainties ( e.g. , de luce & molendi 2004 ) and spatial variations reflecting the large - scale structure ( gilli et al .",
    "2003 ; yang et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "it has been determined that the xrb is mostly the superposed emissions from discrete extragalactic sources , other than at the lowest energies , @xmath9 kev , where its dominant contribution is thermal emission from the local bubble ( lb ) and the galactic halo .",
    "estimated fractional contributions of resolved sources to the xrb are 70 - 80% in the rosat @xmath10 kev ( hasinger et al .",
    "1998 ) and heao-1 a2 @xmath11 kev ( mushotsky et al . 2000 ) bands .",
    "other estimates of the fractional contributions of resolved sources are 60 - 80% ( giacconi et al . 2001 ) , 70% in the 2 - 8 kev band ( cowie et al . 2002 ) .",
    "more recently , worsley et al . ( 2005 ) determined xrb fractions of  85% ,  80% ,  60% ,  50% for the 0.5 - 2 , 2 - 10 , 6 - 10 , 8 - 10 kev bands , respectively .",
    "higher fractions were deduced from deep chandra fields ( cdfs ) , @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the in the 0.5 - 2 and 2 - 8 kev bands , respectively ( bauer et al . 2004 ) .",
    "these contributions include agn , which dominate above @xmath5 kev ( hasinger 2004 , brandt & hasinger 2005 and references therein ; gilli , comastri , & hasinger 2007 ) , star forming galaxies , and galactic stars , but do not include emission from high - mass groups and clusters of galaxies ( which will be simply referred to as clusters ) ; see also ( hickox & markevitch 2006,2007 ) .",
    "a small contribution at very low energies may come from the warm hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) .",
    "most of the unresolved 1 - 2 kev emission can be accounted for by galaxies that are detected in deep hst observations , but are too faint to be detected as individual x - ray sources , as shown by a stacking analysis ( worsley et al .",
    "analysis of the cdfs implies that the maximum contribution of clusters is estimated to be @xmath14 % and @xmath15 % in the 0.5 - 2 kev and 2 - 8 kev bands , respectively .",
    "clusters are important probes of the primordial density fluctuation spectrum and the evolution of the large scale structure .",
    "since conditions in clusters can be gauged by levels of x - ray emission , their estimated contribution to the cxrb can be used as a statistical diagnostic measure of the cluster population and its evolution .",
    "the contribution of clusters to the xrb was estimated in several works ( e.g. , rosati et al .",
    "1998 ; gilli , risaliti , & salvati 1999 ; wu & xue 2001 ) to be less than @xmath16 of the xrb spectral intensity at @xmath17 kev , and even lower at energies @xmath18 kev .",
    "the integrated spectral intensity of clusters can now be calculated more accurately from our improved knowledge of intracluster ( ic ) gas properties , the relevant scaling relations , as well as more precisely determined values of the global cosmological parameters . moreover ,",
    "x - ray line emission , which contributes significantly to the spectrum at low energies , particularly in high - mass groups , should be added to the thermal bremsstrahlung emission ( as has already been shown by phillips , ostriker , & cen 2001 ) .",
    "additional motivation for revisiting the issue of cluster contribution to the cxrb is provided by the possibility of using it to constrain alternative cosmological and lss ( large scale structure ) models , that have been proposed to remove apparent tension between the predictions of the standard model and recent observations of clusters .",
    "possibly discrepant results include the following : ( a ) the detection of proto - spheroidal galaxies at @xmath19 with a substantially higher comoving density than what is predicted by most semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( magliocchetti et al .",
    "even more problematic is the detection of structures with high velocity dispersions at redshifts @xmath20 ( miley et al . 2004 ) and @xmath21 ( kurk et al . 2004 ) .",
    "( b ) the ` excess ' cmb power at high multipoles ( @xmath22 ) measured by the cbi ( readhead et al .",
    "2004 ) , acbar ( kuo et al .",
    "2004 ) , and bima ( dawson et al . 2006 ) arrays .",
    "the measured power levels seem to be too high to be comfortably consistent with the predicted cmb primary anisotropy , and are also outside the range of predicted anisotropy induced by the s - z effect ( sadeh , rephaeli , & silk 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "( c ) high values of the concentration parameter , which were deduced for a1689 from two independent analyses : a joint lensing and x - ray analysis ( lemze et al . 2008a , hereafter l08a ) , and a dynamical analysis ( lemze et al .",
    "2008b , hereafter l08b ) of this cluster .",
    "in addition , high concentrations can explain the recently measured large einstein radii in five high - mass clusters ( broadhurst & barkana 2008 ) , obtained from the analysis of high - quality acs and subaru lensing measurements and chandra data .",
    "these values prove to be high even after relaxing the recent formation time assumption usually adopted in theoretical estimations , by considering the probability distribution function of halo formation times ( sadeh & rephaeli 2008 ) .",
    "all the above apparently discrepant observational results can be naturally explained in the context of lss models with primordial density fluctuation spectrum that had excess power on cluster scales , resulting in earlier formation and higher abundances of high - mass clusters than in the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "several such viable models with the desired enhanced power on cluster scales are non - gaussian @xmath1 models ( e.g. , koyama , soda & taruya 1999 ) and early dark energy models with time - varying coefficient of the quintessence equation of state ( doran et al . 2001 ; caldwell et al .",
    "it has already been suggested by mathis , diego , & silk ( 2004 ) that scale - dependent non - gaussianity ( at a level consistent with observational constraints from wmap measurements ) may be probed through its detectable manifestations on clusters .",
    "the predicted s - z power spectra and cluster number counts were determined by sadeh , rephaeli , & silk ( 2006 , 2007 ) .    earlier formation , higher abundances , and more concentrated ic gas profiles will also be reflected in possibly discernible differences in their x - ray properties when compared with those predicted in the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "therefore , in addition to the need to update and improve calculations of the contribution of clusters to the cxrb , further motivation for extending our previous work on alternative cosmological models is provided by the expectation that cluster x - ray properties could yield additional useful constraints on these models .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : in  [ methodology ] we describe the methodology adopted for the calculation of the spectral contribution of clusters and high mass groups in three distinct cosmological models .",
    "we present our results in  [ results ] , where predicted xrb levels are made for alternative cosmological models , different levels of galactic absorption , various gas profiles , cluster mergers , and in the case when the total gas pressure includes a non - thermal component .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in  [ discussion ] .",
    "x - ray emission from clusters is calculated in @xmath0cdm , non - gaussian ( ng ) , and early dark energy ( ede ) models . in the ng models",
    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the primordial density fluctuation field has a @xmath23 form .",
    "the largest deviation from gaussianity occurs when there is one such field ( @xmath24 ) .",

    "thus , in addition to not being realistic at large radii , the isothermal case is also inconsistent with the entropy profile when @xmath117 is adopted . in order for the entropy profile to have an index of 0.82 , @xmath55 has to be @xmath119 , which is in good agreement with both asca measurements of 30 nearby clusters ( markevitch et al .",

    "the formation of structure in cdm models is hierarchical ; clusters evolve through mergers of subclumps . during these merger events the temperature and luminosity of ic gas",

    "neglecting this boost may lead to an underestimation of the cluster contribution to the cxrb .",

    "for the @xmath0cdm model an increment of 20% in @xmath43 was deduced by fitting to both the tf and xlf . on the other hand , results for @xmath126 were inconclusive ; fitting to the tf and xlf exhibited a decrement and an increment , respectively .",
    "in fact , the results obtained from the xlf fit were less reliable , as indicated by the fact that @xmath126 inferred from the non - boosted functions was lower by 60% than the actual value used to construct the merger trees .",
    "the reason for the lower degree of reliability associated with the fit to the xlf is due to the fact that the range of x - ray luminosities is broader than that of x - ray temperatures ; put otherwise , the x - ray luminosity - temperature scaling is steeper than a linear relation . as a result , the overall effect of luminosity boosts on the xlf is not as strong as the effect of temperature boosts on the tf .",
    "the fitted @xmath43 to the boosted tfs was higher by 20% than the value used to construct the trees , whereas with the non - boosted tfs it was higher by only 10% ( a difference which is due to the approximation used to determine the cluster formation redshift ) . in fig .",
    "[ merger_effect ] we compare our calculated cluster contribution to the cxrb including the effect of mergers with the data .",

    "if we neglect galactic absorption , the computed levels exceed the measured xrb range ; if galactic absorption is included , the power spectrum peaks at approximately the same level as the unabsorbed spectrum generated with the ps mass function . since not all of the xrb in the @xmath154 kev energy range is due to clusters , their partial contribution actually puts a very strong constraint on the value of @xmath64 : as is clear from the figure , the st mass function yields intensity levels which are roughly half of the observational upper limit , if galactic absorption with @xmath153 and @xmath125 are adopted .",

    "based on these excess intensity and power levels , these particular ng models seem to be ruled out .",
    "the degree at which predictions of the ede model may be reconciled with the observational constraints depends on the normalization of the matter power spectrum . with the same @xmath43 as derived from wmap , the intensity bump exceeds the xrb data , similar as in the non - gaussian models . however , when we determine the value of @xmath43 by requiring that the cumulative halo number at @xmath127 in this model matches the corresponding value in the @xmath0 cdm we obtain essentially the same spectrum .",

    "significant advancements in sensitivity and spatial resolution have resulted in an improved ability to resolve the xrb into its different components and sources .",
    "the combination of high quality data and enhanced - accuracy calculations can be used in order to constrain different aspects which affect directly and indirectly the xrb levels . as elaborated upon in  [ cluster_cxrb_contribution ] , the spectral bump in the band @xmath158 kev , an important characteristic of line emission from high - mass groups and poor clusters , constitutes a particularly sensitive probe ; models which boost the emission in this energy band might exceed the xrb data .",
    "another important observational constraint includes the xrb levels in the hard energy band , @xmath11 kev .",
    "it seems to have been established that agn constitute the major contributors in this energy band .",
    "consequently , models in which the cluster contribution is appreciably higher than @xmath159 of the total cxrb intensity would likely be non - viable .",
    "moreover , the combination of extensive measurements of the cxrb and detailed predictions of the contributions of agn , clusters , and starburst galaxies , provide a diagnostic tool of the number density and evolution of these sources , as well as a probe to set constraints on alternative cosmological models .",
    "we demonstrated in this paper that meaningful constraints can be set on alternative cosmological models by contrasting the predicted contribution of clusters to the cxrb in non - gaussian @xmath28 and ede models with the measurements .",
    "as discussed in  [ introduction ] , there seems to be some observational evidence for earlier cluster formation and higher abundances ( as compared with those in @xmath0cdm ) that are predicted in these models .",
    "our basic result is that the cluster contribution in the @xmath156 and @xmath157 models is excessively high at low ( @xmath160 kev ) energies , so much so that these models could probably be ruled out .",
    "moreover , in the high energy band , @xmath11 kev , the predicted spectral intensity attains unrealistically high levels by virtue of the fact that most of the cxrb at these energies originates in agn .",
    "the viability of the ede model considered here depends very much on how exactly this model is normalized with respect to the standard model . with the same @xmath43 as derived from wmap5 values , the predicted energy bump in this ede model exceeds the measured range , as is the case in the non - gaussian models",
    "however , normalizing @xmath43 such that the cumulative halo number at @xmath127 in this model matches the corresponding value in @xmath0cdm , yields nearly the same spectrum .",

    "cxrb levels calculated for two of the three models exceed the observational data in the spectral bump region .",
    "the @xmath161% increment of @xmath43 leads to an overproduction of the xrb intensity levels , also when adopting @xmath125 and the wmap5 parameters , whereas a @xmath162% boost is in marginal agreement with the data ( for a more detailed account of the models see  [ merger_effect ] ) .",
    "the impact of galactic absorption , neglected in these calculations , is discussed in  [ galactic absorption ] .",
    "we explored the impact of non - gravitational heating on the cxrb and found only a minor change .",
    "while the spectral bump is not affected at all , higher energy emission from clusters decreases in proportion with the amount of non - gravitational heating .",
    "nonetheless , this decrement is small , unless non - gravitational heating is considerable . changing the polytropic index , @xmath55 , from @xmath5 ( isothermal ) to @xmath163 also does not alter the spectrum considerably , especially for low @xmath64 . with @xmath120 and @xmath121 the central temperature is higher and the temperature at large radii , @xmath123 is lower than with the @xmath61 case .",
    "however , since the integration of the mass and gas profiles is performed up to the virial radius , we only notice an enhancement of the spectrum levels at high energies . for @xmath125",
    "there is almost no difference between the @xmath61 and @xmath121 cases .",
    "it was shown that inclusion of all relevant emission processes ( i.e. , not just bremsstrahlung ) is very important . especially important is line emission , which generates the @xmath158 kev spectral bump .",

    "there seems to be a slight redshift dependence ; xmm and chandra show no evolution in fe abundances up to @xmath167 ( e.g. , mushotzky 2004 and reference within ) .",
    "however , a certain degree of enrichment must have occurred .",
    "balestra et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that the average iron content of ic gas at @xmath127 is a factor @xmath168 higher than at @xmath169 .",

    "is between our derived values for @xmath172 and @xmath109 .",
    "the impact of using a mass function different than ps was explored by repeating the calculations with the st mass function , which is characterised by higher abundances of high - mass halos in the mass range @xmath173 h@xmath70 m@xmath73 with respect to the corresponding numbers predicted by the ps mass function .",
    "the enhanced abundances result in appreciably higher intensity levels that possibly exceed the measured xrb range for high values of @xmath64 even in @xmath0cdm . clearly , given that not all of the xrb in the @xmath154 kev energy range is due to high - mass groups and clusters , this implied excess provides a very tight constraint on the maximum value of @xmath64 .",
