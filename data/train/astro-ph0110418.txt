    "the nucleosynthesis of nuclei above the iron peak ( @xmath7 ) proceeds mainly by neutron capture in the so - called @xmath8- and @xmath9-processes . in principle , neutron - deficient nuclei in this mass region ( the so - called @xmath10 nuclei , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a complete list ) can be produced from more neutron - rich seed nuclei either by the removal of neutrons or by the addition of protons .",
    "however , due to the coulomb barrier proton capture is strongly suppressed .",
    "there is general agreement that heavy neutron - deficient nuclei with masses above @xmath11 have been synthesized by photodisintegration of previously produced nuclides at sufficiently high temperatures of @xmath12k ( @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being the temperature in billion degrees ) .",
    "this so - called @xmath4-process or p - process is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "several astrophysical sites for the @xmath4-process have been proposed , whereby the oxygen- and neon - rich layers of type ii supernovae seem to be good candidates @xcite , but also exploding carbon - oxygen white dwarfs have been suggested @xcite .",
    "however , no definite conclusions have been reached yet .",
    "nucleosynthesis calculations for the @xmath4-process require a huge number of reaction rates .",
    "up to about 1000 nuclei and 10000 reaction rates have been included in previous reaction networks @xcite .",
    "recently , the complete network of the first self - consistent study of the @xmath4-process including all relevant nuclei up to bi amounted to about 3000 nuclei and all their respective reactions @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , almost none of these reaction rates have been measured and the astrophysical calculations have to rely completely on statistical model calculations ( e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) . of special importance",
    "are ( @xmath4,@xmath1)/(@xmath4,n ) branchings which determine abundance ratios of certain nuclides which , in turn , can in some cases be compared to abundances found in meteoritic inclusions @xcite . it has been stated that the uncertainties for ( @xmath4,@xmath1 ) reaction rates are huge @xcite .",
    "the determination of the @xmath1-nucleus potential at astrophysically relevant energies helps to reduce the uncertainties of the calculations significantly @xcite .",
    "( @xmath4,n ) reaction rates have been measured in a recent work using a quasi - thermal photon spectrum , and rough agreement between theoretical predictions and the measured rates was found @xcite .",
    "the overall agreement between the calculated and the observed abundance patterns of the @xmath10 nuclei is relatively good .",
    "however , the mass region @xmath15 is generally underproduced in the nucleosynthesis calculations @xcite .",
    "the production among others depends on the neutron - producing @xmath16ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath17 mg reaction rate ( which may enhance the @xmath8-process seed nuclei for the @xmath4-process @xcite ) and on the photodisintegration rates in the @xmath4-process but it remains unclear whether the underproduction can be cured by a change in those rates @xcite .",
    "other explanations for this discrepancy include additional production mechanisms like neutrino - induced nucleosynthesis @xcite and additional production sites like the rapid proton capture ( @xmath18 ) process on accreting neutron stars ( e.g.  @xcite ) . however , it is still an open question whether @xmath18-material can be ejected into the interstellar medium in sufficient quantities from these x - ray bursters @xcite .",
    "the motivation of the experimental determination of the @xmath1-nucleus potential for @xmath0mo is twofold .",
    "the determination of the @xmath1-nucleus potential at energies below the coulomb barrier is limited in general because ( @xmath19 ) the experimental data show only small deviations from the rutherford cross section , and ( @xmath20 ) the optical potentials have ambiguities .",
    "an experiment on @xmath0mo allows to extend the systematic study of @xmath1-nucleus potentials @xcite to lower energies .",
    "the second motivation refers directly to the production of the @xmath10 nuclei @xmath0mo and @xmath21mo .",
    "a possible reaction path leading to the production of @xmath0mo and @xmath21mo is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gammaproc ] .",
    "photodisintegration reactions of the nucleus @xmath3ru can lead to the production of ( @xmath19 ) @xmath0mo by @xmath3ru(@xmath4,@xmath1)@xmath0mo and ( @xmath20 ) @xmath21mo by @xmath3ru(@xmath4,n)@xmath22ru(@xmath4,n)@xmath21ru(2@xmath23 @xmath24)@xmath21mo .",
    "if this reaction path were the only production mechanism for @xmath0mo and @xmath21mo , the abundance ratio between @xmath0mo and @xmath21mo would be directly related to the ratio of ( @xmath4,@xmath1 ) and ( @xmath4,n ) reaction rates of @xmath3ru . in this case",
    "the ratio @xmath21mo/@xmath0mo could be a thermometer for the @xmath4-process because of the temperature dependence of the ( @xmath4,n)/(@xmath4,@xmath1 ) branching ratio .",
    "however , for a quantitative analysis contributions of the @xmath18-process to @xmath0mo and @xmath21mo and the weak @xmath8-process contribution to @xmath21mo have to be known .",
    "the choice of the measured energies at about 13 , 16 , and 19mev has the following reasons .",
    "the astrophysically relevant energy window for ( @xmath4,@xmath1 ) reactions at @xmath25 is of the order of @xmath26mev corresponding to @xmath27mev for the reverse reaction @xmath0mo(@xmath1,@xmath4)@xmath3ru . scattering experiments at these low energies are possible ; however , a reliable determination of optical potentials is impossible because of the dominating coulomb interaction .",
    "the height of the coulomb barrier is about 15 mev .",
    "we decided to measure at several energies above and below the coulomb barrier to extract the optical potential and its energy dependence at energies as close as possible to the astrophysically relevant energy range .    in the following paper",
    "we first present our experimental setup ( sect .",

    "[ sec : summ ] ) .",
    "a preliminary analysis of this experiment was presented already in @xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed at the cyclotron laboratory at atomki , debrecen .",
    "we used the @xmath28 diameter scattering chamber which is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we discuss only those properties which are important for the present experiment .",
    "a similar setup has been used in our previous @xmath29sm(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath29sm experiment @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0mo targets were produced by evaporation of 97.33% enriched @xmath0moo@xmath30 on a thin ( 20@xmath31g/@xmath32 ) carbon backing directly before the beamtime at the target laboratory of atomki .",
    "the target was mounted on the target holder in the center of the scattering chamber .",
    "the surface of the evaporated @xmath0moo@xmath30 turned out to be not very flat leading to relatively broad low - energy tails in the spectra of the elastically scattered @xmath1 particles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "the target which was used during the whole experiment had a thickness of about 200@xmath31g/@xmath32 .",
    "the target stability was monitored during the whole experiment to avoid systematic uncertainties from changes in the target foil .",
    "a remote - controlled target ladder was placed in the center of the scattering chamber .",
    "additionally , two apertures were mounted on the target holder to check the beam position and the size of the beam spot directly at the position of the target .",
    "the two apertures had a width and height of 2x6 mm@xmath33 and 6x6 mm@xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the apertures were placed at the target position instead of the @xmath0moo@xmath30 target before and after each variation of the beam energy and beam current .",
    "the beam was optimized until no current could be measured on the larger aperture , and the current on the smaller aperture was minimized ( typically less than 1na compared to about 300na beam current ) .",
    "the width of the beam spot was smaller than 2 mm during the whole experiment , which is very important for the precise determination of the scattering angle .",
    "note that the relatively poor determination of the height of the beam spot does not disturb the claimed precision of the scattering angle ( see sect .",
    "[ subsec : angle ] ) .      for the measurement of the angular distribution we used four silicon surface - barrier detectors with an active area @xmath34 and thicknesses between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the detectors were mounted on an upper and a lower turntable , which can be moved independently . on each turntable",
    "two detectors were mounted at an angular distance of @xmath37 . directly in front of the detectors apertures were placed with the dimensions 1.25 mm @xmath23 5.0 mm ( lower detectors ) and 1.0 mm @xmath23 6.0 mm ( upper detectors ) . together with the distance from the center of the scattering chamber @xmath38 ( lower detectors ) and @xmath39 ( upper detectors ) this results in solid angles from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "the ratios of the solid angles of the different detectors were determined by overlap measurements with an accuracy better than 1% .",
    "additionally , two detectors were mounted at the wall of the scattering chamber at a distance of @xmath42 mm and at a fixed angle of @xmath43 ( left and right side relative to the beam direction ) .",
    "these detectors were used as monitor detectors to normalize the measured angular distribution and to determine the precise position of the beam spot on the target .",
    "the solid angle of both monitor detectors is @xmath44 .",
    "the signals from all detectors were processed using charge - sensitive preamplifiers ( pa ) , which were mounted directly at the scattering chamber .",
    "the output signal was further amplified by a main amplifier ( ma ) and fed into adcs .",
    "the data were collected using the commercially available system wintmca which provides an automatic deadtime control which was found to be reliable in a previous experiment @xcite . for the coincidence measurements ( sect .",
    "[ subsec : angle ] ) additionally the bipolar signals of the mas were fed into timing single channel analyzers ( tsca ) , and the unipolar outputs of the mas were gated using linear gate stretchers ( lgs ) .",
    "the energy resolution of the detectors was tested before the experiment using a mixed @xmath1 source and values better than 20kev were measured . during the experiment",
    "the achieved energy resolution is determined mainly by the energy spread of the primary beam and by the thickness and flatness of the target .",
    "depending on the measured angle , the achieved energy resolution was between 0.5% and 2% corresponding to @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "two typical spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the relevant peaks from elastic @xmath0mo-@xmath1 scattering are well separated from inelastic and from background peaks .",
    "the angular calibration of the setup is of crucial importance for the precision of a scattering experiment at energies close to the coulomb barrier because the rutherford cross section depends sensitively on the angle with @xmath47 .",
    "a small uncertainty of @xmath48 in the determination of @xmath49 leads to a cross section uncertainty of 2.0% ( 1.0% ; 0.6% ) at an angle @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ; @xmath52 ) .",
    "the following methods were applied to measure the precise scattering angle @xmath49 .",
    "the position of the beam on the target was continuously controlled by two monitor detectors .",
    "the precise position of the beam spot was derived from the ratio of the count rates in both monitor detectors .",
    "typical corrections were smaller than one millimeter , leading to corrections in @xmath49 of the order of @xmath48 .",
    "however , because of the minor beam quality at the 16mev measurement , larger corrections had to be applied to this angular distribution leading to larger uncertainties in the determination of the optical potential .",
    "the position of the four detectors was calibrated using the steep kinematics of @xmath53h(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath53h scattering at forward angles ( @xmath54 ) @xcite .",
    "the results of our previous experiment could be confirmed within the uncertainties @xcite .    finally , we measured a kinematic coincidence between elastically scattered @xmath1 particles and the corresponding @xmath55c recoil nuclei using a carbon backing without molybdenum as target .",
    "one detector was placed at @xmath56 ( left side relative to the beam axis ) , and the signals from elastically scattered @xmath1 particles on @xmath55c were selected by a tsca .",
    "this tsca output was used as gate for the signals from another detector which was moved around the corresponding @xmath55c recoil angle @xmath57 ( right side ) .",
    "the maximum recoil count rate was found almost exactly at the expected angle ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : coin ] ) .    in summary , the overall uncertainty of the angles @xmath49 in this experiment",
    "is about @xmath48 for the measurements at 13 and 19mev and about @xmath58 for the 16mev measurement .",
    "three angular distributions have been measured at energies of @xmath59 , 16.42 , and 13.83mev .",
    "the beam current was between @xmath60na and @xmath61na .",
    "the experiment covers the full angular range from forward angles of @xmath50 to backward angles of @xmath62 in steps of about @xmath63 at all three energies .",
    "the statistical uncertainties of each data point vary from @xmath64 at forward angles to about @xmath65 at backward angles .",
    "the count rates @xmath66 in the four detectors have been normalized to the number of counts in the monitor detectors @xmath67 : @xmath68 with @xmath69 being the solid angles of the detectors .",
    "these measured cross sections have been transferred to the center - of - mass system .",
    "the cross section at the monitor position @xmath70 is given by the rutherford cross section .",
    "the relative measurement eliminates the typical uncertainties of absolute measurements which come mainly from changes in the target and from the beam current integration .",
    "nevertheless , the beam current was measured by standard current integration in the faraday cup , and the absolute value of the cross section was consistent with the measured relative cross sections .",
    "the three angular distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] .",
    "the lines are the result of optical model calculations ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : om ] ) .",
    "the measured cross sections cover five orders of magnitude between the highest ( forward angles at @xmath71mev ) and the smallest cross section ( backward angles at @xmath72mev ) with almost the same accuracy .",
    "further details of the experimental set - up and the data analysis can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the scattering data was performed in the framework of the optical model ( om ) .",
    "the complex optical potential is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the coulomb potential , and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the real and the imaginary part of the nuclear potential , respectively .",
    "the real part of the optical potential was calculated by a double  folding procedure : @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 are the densities of projectile and target , respectively , and @xmath80 is the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction taken in the well - established ddm3y parametrization @xcite .",
    "details about the folding procedure can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . the folding integral in eq .  ( [ eq : fold ] )",
    "was calculated using the code dfold @xcite .",
    "the resulting real part of the optical potential @xmath75 is derived from the folding potential @xmath81 by two minor modifications : @xmath82 firstly , the strength of the folding potential is adjusted by the usual strength parameter @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "this leads to volume integrals of the real potential [ see eq .",

    "different parametrizations of the imaginary part of the optical potential were chosen .",

    "fourier - bessel ( fb ) potentials are given by @xmath110 with the cutoff radius @xmath111 .",
    "again , the fourier - bessel coefficients @xmath112 are adjusted to the experimental data .",
    "the elastic scattering cross sections were calculated from optical potentials with the computer code a0 @xcite .",

    "the five imaginary potentials are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : imagpot ] .    since we want to determine the optical potential at astrophysically relevant energies we have to extrapolate from the present measurements . because of the oscillating behavior of the fourier - bessel potentials we decided to use the combination of a volume and surface woods - saxon potential as basis for the extrapolation .",
    "the @xmath113 obtained with this potential is practically identical to the @xmath113 obtained from the fourier - bessel potentials . the calculations with a pure volume woods - saxon or a pure surface woods - saxon show significantly worse @xmath113 values .    in a second analysis the strength parameter @xmath83 and the width @xmath92 of the real potential",
    "were varied in a wider range .",
    "it was found that it is not possible to get a good fit to the data when the @xmath92 parameter deviates from 1.0 by more than a few per cent .",
    "however , a variation of @xmath83 leads to the known so - called `` family problem '' .",
    "it is possible to obtain comparable fits to the experimental data with various @xmath83 parameters .",

    "one can clearly see the families 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 as minima in @xmath113 , corresponding to @xmath83 values of @xmath115 .",
    "note that the minima are more pronounced than in the previous @xmath29sm(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath29sm experiment @xcite because the ratio @xmath116 between the energy @xmath117 and the coulomb barrier @xmath118 is much higher in this @xmath0mo experiment .",
    "it is not possible to extract the correct family from these experimental data only .",

    "therefore , we have adjusted this fermi - like function to the experimental data .",
    "both parametrizations utilizing our fit parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : volume]b ( brown - rho ) and  [ fig : volume]c ( fermi - like ) for our new @xmath0mo data .",
    "the parameters are listed in table [ tab : brgg ] . in the following",
    ", we will always use the parameters given in that table for the two descriptions unless specified otherwise .    in general , the shapes of the br and the fermi parametrizations are quite similar",
    ": there is a saturation value @xmath140 and a parameter that describes the steep rise of @xmath138 : @xmath136 for br and @xmath143 for the fermi shape .",
    "however , there are also important differences because the br parametrization leads to a somewhat flatter rise of @xmath138 than that of the fermi function , and consequently , the extrapolation to lower energies is lower for the fermi parametrization than for br .",
    "consequences of these small differences will be given in sect .",
    "[ subsec : rate ] .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that the br parametrization only contains two free parameters , because @xmath135 is fixed , whereas the fermi shape has three free parameters , in principle .",
    "the shown ambiguities do not allow to determine the shape of the imaginary part .",
    "these ambiguities reduce the reliability of extrapolations to lower energies .",
    "a more stringent determination of the shape of the imaginary part requires extremely precise scattering data over a wide range of energies .",
    "a scattering experiment at about 50mev might help to reduce these uncertainties and to find the best parametrization of the imaginary volume integrals .",
    "the astrophysical decay rate @xmath144 is given by @xmath145 with the speed of light @xmath146 , the cross section @xmath147 of the ( @xmath4,@xmath1 ) reaction , and the photon density @xmath148 of a thermal photon bath at temperature @xmath149 @xmath150 the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) can be analyzed under the assumption that the astrophysical s - factor of the reverse ( @xmath1,@xmath4 ) reaction is constant : @xmath151 .",

    "( [ eq : tau ] ) is found at the energy @xmath152 with @xmath153 and the threshold energy @xmath154 for the ( @xmath4,@xmath1 ) reaction .",
    "the most effective energy @xmath155 for ( @xmath4,@xmath1 ) reactions is given by the energy of the well - known gamow window @xmath156 for the inverse ( @xmath1,@xmath4 ) reaction plus the separation energy @xmath154 of the @xmath1 particle .",
    "note that the energy @xmath155 is the energy of the photon , whereas the energy @xmath156 is the center - of - mass energy in the system @xmath0mo - @xmath1 .",
    "the astrophysically relevant energies for the system @xmath0mo - @xmath1 are listed in table [ tab : gamow ] .    in all astrophysical applications reaction rates",
    "are input only for reactions with positive @xmath157 value and the inverse rate is then computed by applying detailed balance ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . that way , numerical stability of the reaction network is guaranteed and the proper equilibria of forward and reverse rates can be attained for a given channel .",
    "the rates in the two directions depend linearly on each other and thus the change of , say , the @xmath1 potential equally influences both , in our case the @xmath1 capture as well as the photodisintegration with @xmath1 emission .",
    "this relation is valid provided that stellar rates are used in both directions , accounting for thermal excitation of the respective targets . because of that fact , in the following sections we make use of rate ratios so that the conclusions apply to the forward and inverse rates as well .      as stated in sect .",
    "[ subsec : disc ] , the extrapolation of the real potential can be performed reliably leading to @xmath158mev@xmath86 at astrophysically relevant energies with an uncertainty of about 5% .",
    "the corresponding strength parameter is @xmath159 .",
    "the width parameter was fixed at @xmath160 .",
    "the extrapolation of the imaginary part was performed as follows . in a first step",
    "the volume integral @xmath138 was determined from the br and fermi parametrizations leading to @xmath161mev@xmath86 ( br ) and @xmath162mev@xmath86 ( fermi ) at @xmath163mev ( corresponding to @xmath164 ) .",
    "the average of these values is @xmath165mev@xmath86 which was used for the following calculations .",
    "the shape of the potential was taken as sum of volume and surface woods - saxon potentials where the radius parameter @xmath108 and the diffuseness @xmath109 were estimated from the experimental data .",
    "the contribution of the volume term to @xmath138 is assumed to be 30% , and the surface term contributes to 70% .",
    "this ratio is determined from the experimental scattering data at @xmath166 , 19 , and 30mev .",
    "the effect of a variation of the relative contributions of volume and surface term to @xmath138 will be discussed below .",
    "these and other variations of the potentials allow an estimation of the uncertainties of the calculated reaction rates .      the variation of the reaction rates when using various potentials is shown in tables [ tab : rateratio ] and [ tab : variation ] . in table",
    "[ tab : rateratio ] the ratios of rates obtained with the different potentials in respect to a standard rate ( taken from refs .",
    "@xcite and using an @xmath1 potential from ref .",
    "@xcite ) are shown . as can be seen , the rate calculated with the global potential of ref .",
    "@xcite is lower by about two orders of magnitude than the standard rate .",
    "however , it was already stated above that this potential does not describe the @xmath0mo data at higher energies .",
    "a simple equivalent square well potential @xcite also yields a factor of 8 lower cross sections but neither does it describe the data nor is it considered to be reliable for this application @xcite .",
    "when using the two potentials with the extrapolated parameters for @xmath5 and @xmath6 from table [ tab : extrapol ] , a reduction of the rate of about @xmath167% is found .",
    "case ab explores the dependence on the geometry of the potential .",
    "a change in the geometry parameters of only @xmath168% leads to a variation in the ratio of @xmath169% in the rate ratios which underlines the importance of additional scattering experiments to determine the shape of the imaginary optical potential .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that case ab is not fully consistent within our approach because it has a slightly different volume integral @xmath138 and rms radius due to the unchanged depths of the volume and surface terms , but the differences are only of the same order of magnitude as those in the geometry parameters .",
    "the sensitivity of the rates to variations in the extrapolated volume integral @xmath138 and the relative contributions of volume and surface term are studied in table [ tab : variation ] . here",
    "the varied rates are compared to the rate obtained in case a of table [ tab : rateratio ] .",
    "the ratios are given in the temperature range @xmath170 in order to show the temperature dependence of those effects although strictly speaking the potential was derived assuming @xmath5 .",
    "the contribution of the surface term to @xmath138 was varied within a reasonable range of @xmath171% .",
    "this resulted in a variation of the rate of about @xmath172% .",
    "another uncertainty is introduced by the fact that we assumed the extrapolated @xmath138 to be the mean between the value obtained by the br and fermi parametrizations . using the higher br value of @xmath173",
    "mev@xmath86 increases the rate by 8% while using the lower value of @xmath174 mev@xmath86 a suppression by about 10% is obtained .",
    "thus , the error introduced by the different shapes of the parametrizations used for the extrapolation of @xmath138 to low energies is dominating but still within satisfactory accuracy .    closing this section",
    "we conclude that the recommended rates are case a for @xmath5 and case b for @xmath6 from table [ tab : rateratio ] with an error of 16% , mainly introduced by the ambiguities of the extrapolation of the imaginary part down to the relevant energies .",
    "the recommended rate is roughly a factor of two lower than the standard rate given in previous tabulations @xcite .",
    "we measured the elastic scattering cross section of @xmath0mo(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0mo in a wide angular range at energies of @xmath2 13 , 16 , and 19mev .",
    "additionally , data from literature have been analyzed @xcite .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the optical potential for the system @xmath0mo - @xmath1 have been extracted from the data and extrapolated down to the astrophysically relevant energies around and below the coulomb barrier .",
    "the result fits well into the known systematic behavior of @xmath1-nucleus folding potentials .",
    "the extrapolation of the imaginary part is not unique but our study shows that the use of two different energy dependencies introduces an error in the obtained rate of not more than 15% .",
    "the derived stellar rates ( for @xmath0mo(@xmath1,@xmath4)@xmath3ru as well as @xmath3ru(@xmath4,@xmath1)@xmath0mo ) are @xmath175% of the rates given in refs .",
    "@xcite at stellar temperatures @xmath176 .",
    "assuming the @xmath3ru(@xmath4,n)@xmath22ru rate to remain unchanged , this would lead to a corresponding decrease in the abundance ratio @xmath177 with respect to an abundance ratio calculated with the previous rate in the @xmath4-process ( as e.g.  in @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that many network calculations for the @xmath4-process @xcite show an overproduction of @xmath0mo relative to @xmath21mo which may be reduced by the results of this work .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , a complete analysis has not only to follow the @xmath4-process consistently but also to account for the possible @xmath18- and @xmath8-process contributions .",
