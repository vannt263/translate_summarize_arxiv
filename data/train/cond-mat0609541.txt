    "superconductor  normal metal  superconductor ( sns ) junctions have the current - voltage characteristics ( cvcs ) with rich peculiarities . given certain parameters of junction , cvcs of sns junctions demonstrate the excess current , the subharmonic gap structure and the negative differential resistance at low bias voltage .",
    "the region of negative differential resistance corresponds to the hysteresis of voltage in the bias current measurements .",
    "the sns junctions with nonlinear cvcs are promising for different applications , e.g. low - noise mixers in submillimetre - wave region @xcite , switcher @xcite , nanologic circuits @xcite .    description of cvcs of sns junctions was subject of many articles and there were recognized the key role of multiple andreev reflections @xcite .",
    "the main features of cvcs enumerated above are successfully described by kmmel - gunsenheimer - nicolsky theory ( kgn ) @xcite .",
    "kgn theory is applicable for the thick and clean weak links , where the normal metal layer n has the thickness @xmath3 larger than the coherence length of superconductor , the inelastic mean free path @xmath4 larger than @xmath3 .",
    "a simplified model in frame of kgn theory was developed by l.a.a .",
    "pereira and r. nicolsky @xcite .",
    "this simple model is relevant for the weak links with thin superconducting banks s. the contribution of scattering states @xcite is omitted in the model @xcite .",
    "pereira - nicolsky and kgn model were applied earlier to describe experimental cvcs of various weak links @xcite .",
    "experience of applications demonstrates that oversimplified pereira - nicolsky model gives only qualitative description .",
    "we suggest a new simple modification of kgn theory .",
    "it is shown that the cvcs of sns junctions can be computed without all the complex ansatz of kgn theory .",
    "we hope this will lead to more extensive using of kgn based approach to the calculation of weak link characteristics .",
    "let us consider a voltage - biased sns junction with a constant electric field which is in negative z direction perpendicular to the ns interfaces and exists in the n layer only ( ) .",
    "the normal layer has the thickness @xmath3 .",
    "the thickness of superconducting bank is @xmath5 .",
    "dynamics of quasiparticles in the sns junction was considered in the work @xcite , where the time dependent bogoliubov - de gennes equations are solved for the wave packets of nonequilibrium electrons and holes .",
    "the expression for dissipative current density in sns junction was resulted in @xcite .",
    "calculations of density of states @xcite and probability of finding of the quasiparticles @xcite in the n region are requested preliminary to calculate the current .",
    "the expression for current through sns junction with thick superconducting banks ( @xmath5 ) can be written as following @xcite :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the two dimensional density of states , @xmath8 is the probability of finding of the quasiparticles with the energy @xmath9 in the n region , @xmath10 is the effective mass of electron , @xmath4 is the inelastic mean free path and @xmath11 is the resistance of the n region with the thickness @xmath3 , @xmath12 is the value of energy gap of superconductor at the temperature @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the z component of fermi wave vector of quasiparticles , @xmath15 is the number of andreev reflections which quasiparticles undergo before they move out of the pair potential well .    the probability @xmath8 of finding of quasiparticles with energy @xmath9 in the n region is given by eq.(2.19 ) of @xcite :    @xmath16    with the penetration depth @xmath17 for @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 otherwise .",
    "for the quasiparticles from the scattering states @xmath21 .",
    "let us accept for the sake of simplicity @xmath22 .",
    "therefore @xmath23 for the bound states .",
    "the density of states @xcite is found from    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the normal layer area , @xmath26 defines the value of @xmath14 for which @xmath27 .",
    "the energy spectrum @xmath28 consists of the spatially quantized bound states and the quasicontinuum scattering states .",
    "the energy eigenvalue equation for the spatially quantized bound andreev states @xcite is transcendental ; it calculated numerically only :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 = 0,1,2 , ",
    "let us simplify eq.([eq2er ] ) .",
    "the expansion of arccos(@xmath31 in ( [ eq2er ] ) to taylor series @xmath32 +  ) up to the second term and the subsequent expressing of @xmath28 are executed .",
    "then we inserted the correcting multiplier @xmath33 for best fitting of eq.([eq2er ] ) .",
    "@xmath34    ; @xmath35  ; @xmath36 mev ; @xmath37 @xmath38 .",
    "1 ) eq.([eq4c ] ) , @xmath39 ; 2 ) eq.([eq4c ] ) , @xmath40 ; 3 ) the exact solution of eq.([eq2er ] ) ; 4 ) eq.([eq4c ] ) , @xmath41 ; 5 ) eq.([eq4c ] ) , @xmath42.,width=330,height=238 ]    if @xmath39 then the spectrum of pereira - nicolsky model is reproduced ( curve 1 , ) .",
    "r. kmmel used eq.([eq4c ] ) with @xmath42 @xcite for approximated calculation of the energy spectrum ( curve 5 , ) .",
    "the density of bound states follows from ( [ eq_dos ] ) and ( [ eq4c ] )    @xmath43    for quasiparticles from the quasicontinuum states , the energy spectrum is approximated by the continuous bcs spectrum of homogeneous superconductor @xcite :    @xmath44    for sns junction with thick superconducting banks , the effective energy gap @xmath45 equals @xmath12 .",
    "then the density of quasicontinuum scattering states is    @xmath46     of sns junction with thick superconducting banks resulted by @xcite ( dotted line ) , @xmath47 calculated by eq.([eq4c ] ) with @xmath42 ( dash line ) , @xmath47 calculated by eq.([eq4c ] ) with @xmath48 ( solid line ) .",
    "@xmath49  ; @xmath35  ; @xmath50 k ; @xmath37 @xmath38.,width=330,height=238 ]    it is reasonable to choose the variable multiplier @xmath33 from the best fitting of the energy spectrum and the density of states .",
    "we suggest @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath40 otherwise .",
    "such choice of @xmath33 provides a good agreement of eq.([eq4c ] ) ( curve 4 , ) with the numerical solution of eq.([eq2er ] ) for different relation of @xmath53 .",
    "the coincidence of density of states resulted with @xmath47 by @xcite is satisfactory ( ) .",
    "the current density of quasiparticles from bound states is resulted with ( [ eq1iv ] ) and ( [ eq5gbs ] ) :    @xmath54    after substitution of ( [ eq7gss ] ) to ( [ eq1iv ] ) and exclusion of small term , we get the current density of quasiparticles from quasicontinuum states :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 = @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 otherwise .    the current densities ( [ eq_jbs ] ) and ( [ eq9jss ] ) include the voltage dependence only within the integral limits .",
    "if @xmath60 , @xmath61 the integral in ( [ eq9jss ] ) can be transformed and the excess current density is resulted :    @xmath62    this excess current density is the same as one obtained in kgn theory ( eq.(4.12 ) in @xcite ) .    note that @xmath63 dependence does not change practically if the second summation in ( [ eq_jbs ] ) is interrupted at @xmath64 .",
    "therefore we can write the expression for total current density as follows    @xmath65    @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath40 otherwise ; @xmath56 = @xmath57 for @xmath66 and @xmath59 otherwise .",
    "this simplified model allows to calculate the cvcs of weak links with thick @xmath67 superconducting banks .",
    "it operates for different thicknesses of normal layer @xmath68 and different temperatures lower @xmath1 .",
    "the model is successfully applied for the description of cvcs of sns junctions @xcite .",
    "the steep rise of current density at low voltage , the arches of subharmonic gap structure ( sgs ) , and the excess current are reproduced ( ) in the computed cvcs ( [ eq11tot ] ) .",
    "the multiple andreev reflection is the main reason for these peculiarities @xcite .",
    "position of the ( n-1)th arch of sgs is between @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , so the largest 1th arch is between @xmath12 and @xmath72 .",
    "small peaks on the arches near @xmath69 are caused by subgap peak on @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath73 k , @xmath74 mev , @xmath37 @xmath38 , @xmath75  , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "arrows ( d ) and ( e ) display the hysteretic jumps of voltage in current - biased cvc , width=330,height=238 ]    the number of allowed andreev reflections decreases with increasing of bias voltage @xcite . the current density due to andreev reflections",
    "decreases correspondingly . in that time the ohmic current density increases as well as voltage .",
    "region of the negative differential resistance appears in the cvc if the decreasing of andreev current density is stronger than the increasing of the ohmic current density .",
    "the measurement of current - biased cvc demonstrates the hysteretic voltage jumps ( ) instead the region of negative differential resistance .    to prove the model we firstly @xcite described the cvcs of tin microbridges @xcite in different temperatures",
    "the hysteretic peculiarity is absent in the cvcs",
    ". satisfactory agreement of the calculated curves and the experimental data is achieved @xcite for the known parameters of sn .",
    "the application of model is possible to describe the cvcs of combination of weak links e.g. networks and contacts connected in series .",
    "the networks of weak links , which realize in the polycrystalline high-@xmath1 superconductors , have the composite cvcs .",
    "these cvcs are a superposition of individual cvcs of the single weak links that constitutes the network .",
    "fitting parameters for current and voltage should be used in the model to account a straining of cvc along @xmath78 and @xmath79 axes @xcite .",
    "the weak links connected in series ( snsns ... ) can be realized in the break junctions and wires with phase slip centers . in this case",
    ", the straining of cvcs along @xmath79 axis is accounted by the formula for series of weak links with dispersion of parameters @xcite .    .",
    "experiment @xcite ( points ) and calculations ( solid lines).,width=330,height=238 ]    we used the developed model to compute the cvc of composite 92.5% ybco + 7.5% bapbo@xmath80 @xcite that is the network of weak links .",
    "we get the satisfactory agreement ( ) for the parameters of investigated composite ( @xmath81 k , @xmath82 mev , @xmath83 @xmath38 , @xmath84  , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 k ) .",
    "the scale of right axis in units @xmath88 demonstrates the straining of cvc due to the superposition of individual cvcs of single weak links .",
    "this description of experimental cvc is more correct than earlier one @xcite by pereira - nicolsky model .",
    "the simplified model for calculation of current - voltage characteristics of sns junctions was developed .",
    "the kgn approach @xcite was changed to be more convenient for description of experimental cvcs of weak links with thick superconducting banks .",
    "the model operates for different thicknesses of normal layer @xmath68 and different temperatures lower @xmath1 .",
    "the frequent observed peculiarities ( steep rise of current , arches of subharmonic gap structure , negative differential resistance , excess current ) in cvcs of sns junctions are interpreted to be produced by the multiple andreev reflections . the hysteretic peculiarity is described as result of the negative differential resistance .",
    "the model was applied to compute the hysteretic current - voltage characteristics of high-@xmath1 composite ybco + bapbo@xmath2 .",
