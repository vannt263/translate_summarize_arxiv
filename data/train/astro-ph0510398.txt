    "though diffuse elliptical galaxies represent majority of the galaxy populations in dense regions of the nearby universe like rich clusters , their origin and evolution remain still a matter of debate .",
    "two main scenarios proposed so far are ( a ) early hierarchical collapse with a feedback of star formation ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and ( b ) environmental evolution : ram pressure stripping of disc galaxies in clusters ( @xcite ) and groups ( @xcite ) , or gravitational harassment ( @xcite ) .",
    "the predictions of the popular now cdm cosmological simulations for the number and intrinsic structures of the nearby dwarf galaxies does not agree with the real situation , as well as the multi - burst star formation histories of dsph of the local group are quite unexpected in the frame of the hierarchical concept ( @xcite ) .",
    "so observations remain the only valid way to find a clue to their formation and evolution .",
    "the dynamical structure of the des is not clear too . from a sample of  35 des ,",
    "only a few are not consistent with rotational flattening ( prolate or triaxial ) ( @xcite ) . however , there are non - rotating ellipsoidal dwarfs like tidally stressed objects ( like ngc205 ) , or some other non - rotating flat objects , like ic  794 , probably anysotropic .",
    "fine structures : embedded bars and discs sometimes with spiral patterns have been found in some des ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they may argue for a hypothesis of common origin of des and dirrs .    by using the benefits of the integral - field spectroscopy providing two - dimensional distributions of the kinematical parameters , as well as of absorption - line indices , we aim to search for ( 1 ) kinematical counterparts of the morphological fine structures revealed by the surface photometry ,",
    "( 2 ) related subpopulations in the stellar content .",
    "in 2004 we started to observe de galaxies in virgo cluster with the mpfs integral field unit ( ifu ) spectrograph at the russian 6-m telescope .",
    "the technique of 3d spectroscopy allows to obtain spatially resolved distribution of kinematical characteristics ( radial velocity and velocity dispersion fields ) independently for gas and stars , and stellar population parameters ( for example , maps of line - strength indices ) in a single exposure .",
    "observations of the galaxies have been performed with the mpfs ifu spectrograph on the 6 m telescope of sao ras during three observing runs in 2004 .",
    "the parameters of the observations are presented in tab .",

    "here we present the results for three diffuse galaxies : ic3468 and ic3653 in the virgo cluster , and ngc770 in the ngc772 group .",
    "we are modeling the simplest star formation history containing one burst .",
    "rather low s / n ratio does nt allow very precise measurements .",
    "the results shown are obtained for tessellations with target s / n=10 .",
    "no young subpopulation is detected . for a main burst with @xmath0 gyr with low metallicity ( [ m / h]=-0.4 ) we see some metallicity gradient ( from -0.3 in the centre till -0.55 in the outskirts ) .",
    "velocity dispersion map shows stripe with low values ( near the limit of the measurements , about 20 km / s ) aligned along the major axis of the isophotes .",
    "radial velocity field is quite irregular and asymmetric , though showing some kind of rotation with the amplitude of 10 km / s .",
    "good s / n ratio allows to build precise maps of the parameters till 7  from the centre of the galaxy .",
    "disc rotation with the amplitude of about 40 km / s is seen in the radial velocity field with the strongest gradient in the inner region , that is quite unusual for objects of such type .",
    "velocity dispersion shows gradient from 90 km / s in the centre till 45 km / s in the outer regions .",
    "age map is almost flat with a mean age of 7 gyr , all details seen are not statistically significant except young values in the very centre .",
    "metallicity distribution shows shallow gradient from @xmath1=0 $ ] in the centre to @xmath1=-0.2 $ ] at the outskirts with a small metal - rich nuclear region ( [ m / h]=0.2 ) .",
    "there is a marginal detection of younger population @xmath2 gyr in the centre which may contain a mass fraction of 1 to 3 percent .",
    "the maps are computed for target s / n values of 15 .",
    "the galaxy experiences strong tidal interaction with the giant spiral ngc772 .",
    "its luminosity ( m@xmath3=-18.4 ) and velocity dispersion ( 110 - 120 km / s ) place it between giants and dwarfs . very good s /",
    "n ratio allows precise measurements of all the parameters ( for example , @xmath4 ) .",
    "good sampling of losvd due to high velocity dispersion allows to measure h3 and h4 gauss - hermit coefficients .",
    "we see impressive kinematically decoupled core in this object .",
    "there are evidences for considering it to be a counter - rotating young metal - rich highly inclined stellar disc aligned almost with the major axis of the galaxy : ( 1 ) velocity dispersion map shows larger values on the `` switches '' of the velocity , there is a stripe with lower values orthogonal to the structures in age / metallicity distributions ; ( 2 ) map of h3 coefficient shows regions with positive and negative values before and after `` switch '' of the velocity ; ( 3 ) age and metallicity distributions clearly show the decoupled structure aligned almost along the major axis having younger age ( @xmath5 vs @xmath6 ) and higher metallicity ( @xmath7 \\sim -0.05 $ ] vs @xmath8 ) than the surrounding spheroid .",
    "the galaxy probably had a partially dissipative merger event , that induced a burst of star formation some 4.5 gyr ago producing the central stellar structure that we see now as a counter rotating subpopulation with the high metallicity .",
    "kinematical features found in the de galaxies studies strengthen the connection between des and dirrs .",
    "inner discs are probably the remnants of the stellar discs existing before gas removal .    whatever the gas - removal mechanism is ( winds or ram pressure stripping ) the signatures would be the same . but these systems probably did not undergo strong relaxation which would have erased the structures and population gradients .",
    "most des should have the same origin , i.e. the same type of progenitors ( pre - di ) .",
    "they had a different history , i.e. interplay between feedback , ram pressure stripping and tidal effects .",
    "the investigation of the properties of the kinematical and population substructures will help to understand this history .",
    "we would like to thank international astronomical union providing financial support for attending iau colloquium 198 , 6-m telescope time allocation committee , intas foundation providing phd fellowship for i.c . , egide and cnrs for additional support ."
