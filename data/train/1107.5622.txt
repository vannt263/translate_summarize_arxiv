    "conjugated polymers  @xcite can be thought of as soft , low - dimensional conductors or semiconductors . due to their promise in technological applications such as leds , solar cells  @xcite , and even biosensors  @xcite , a great variety of such materials",
    "have been synthesized and studied .",
    "independent of their specific chemical details , the existence of extended electronic states along their polymeric backbone provides for their surprising ( for a polymer ) electronic properties .",
    "we refer to these ( semi-)conductors as `` soft '' since their polymeric backbones typically have a short ( nanometer scale ) thermal persistence length ; the conduction path along the polymers in equilibrium solution should be considered to be a tortuous random - walk .",
    "these molecules admit strong correlations between their fluctuating local configurational and electronic properties  @xcite . in the extreme case , sharp ( i.e. localized ) bends in the polymeric backbone result in regions of poor electron transport at these so - called conjugation breaks .",
    "conversely , the electronic degrees of freedom of the molecule influence its conformational degrees of freedom .",
    "high electronic mobility along the thermally fluctuating backbone s random path allows for complexities in the interactions of a conjugated polymer with itself and with other such molecules .",
    "for example , in conducting chains the pressure of the electron gas trapped between nearby conjugation breaks ( sharp bends ) in the chain should force such sharp bends apart and thus enhance the statistical weight of locally straighter backbone contours  @xcite .",
    "thus , the electronic degrees of freedom contribute to the effective persistence length of the polymer .",
    "moreover , looped conformations of the polymer backbone generating close contacts of parts of the polymer separated by a large arc length along its backbone may further perturb the electronic structure of the molecule by introducing tunneling between distant sites along the chain .",
    "this sort of `` bridge conduction ''  @xcite leads to localized attractive interactions of the polymer at such crossing points where the chain makes a near pass to either itself or another . based on this electronically mediated intra - molecular attraction",
    ", one may imagine that conjugated polymers can self - aggregate into compact globules in solution  @xcite . at higher polymeric concentrations",
    ", one would expect to observe interchain binding , the subject of this article .",
    "more recently , detailed numerical calculations have been preformed that determined the magnitude of these inter - chain tunneling matrix elements for specific conjugated polymers  @xcite .",
    "using these results and a simple tight - binding model for metallic  @xcite and/or semiconducting  @xcite chains , we showed that , for the case of pairs of chains , intermolecular tunneling leads to attractive interactions for which the binding energy is @xmath0 .",
    "the tunneling creates a pair of electronic bound states localized at the inter - chain crossing , leading to a total decrease of the electronic contribution to the system s energy on this scale .",
    "one may look at this attractive interaction as an analogue to the traditional covalent chemical bond , but at an energy scale two orders of magnitude weaker .",
    "we understand the weakness of the bond to result from a combination of molecular geometry creating a larger than typical internuclear distance in the bond and the energetic cost of localizing the electrons from the extended states of the molecule in order to fill the new localized bound state .",
    "the magnitude of this intermolecular , short - ranged interaction suggests that the statistical mechanics of intermolecular binding driven by this mechanism is rather subtle , since both chain configurational entropy and chain bending energies contribute to the free energy of the system at the same energy scale .    in the current article we study in more detail the effect of inter - chain tunneling sites on the electronic states of semiconducting chains by exploring analytically the interaction of pairs of such tunneling sites , the interaction of solitonic chain excitations with such tunneling sites , and determining the electronic ground state of pairs of chains bound uniformly along their length .",
    "we also use numerical calculations incorporating more details of the chemical structure of the molecules in question to study the dependence of the electronic binding interaction on the local geometry of the crossing point between the two chains .",
    "finally , we use these results as input to a generalized poland - scheraga model describing the binding of two chains . using this model , we determine the critical concentration for chain pairing and study how the conformational statistics , as parameterized by the effective thermal persistence length of the paired chains evolves as a function of the strength of the binding interaction .",
    "to introduce the bandgap at the fermi level and thus create the semiconducting state , we use the ssh model  @xcite for polyacetylene .",
    "this simple tight - binding system undergoes a peierls instability  @xcite .",
    "while this model is based on the specific and uniquely simple model of polyacetylene , we believe that the results we obtain apply more broadly to semiconducting conjugated polymers .",
    "indeed , similar tight - binding models have proven useful in predicting not only the properties of polyacetylene , but have been found to be a useful model for more chemically complex conjugated polymers such as ppv  @xcite .",
    "thus , we present this model as a general one for the interactions between the electronic degrees of freedom and the conformational state of the polymer .",
    "our principal results may be summarized as follows .",
    "we find ( section [ sec : singlesection ] ) that the magnitude of the single - site binding energy and the nature of the bound electron wavefunction are both very similar for the binding metallic or semiconducting chains .",
    "this similarity is due to the fact that the binding energy is associated with the creation of localized states having energies far from the fermi energy , so that the density of states at the fermi energy in the unperturbed system is not relevant to the inter - chain interaction energy .",
    "these results were discussed previously in ref .",
    "we also examine tunneling site interactions with each other ( section [ twositesection ] ) and with solitons that are necessarily present on sufficiently long dimerized chains ( section [ sec : solitons ] ) .",
    "we also compare the lowest - energy bound state configurations of semiconducting and metallic chains .",
    "although these two systems seem similar at the level of individual tunneling sites , in section [ sec : bindingsymmetry ] we find that the ground states differ rather dramatically  @xcite . we also discuss the implications of our numerical quantum chemical calculations for the stability of these ground states , determined by the ssh model . in section [ sec : polymer ] we employ these results in the development of a modified poland - scheraga model to describe inter - chain binding and the conformational statistics of the result bound chain pairs . we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] , and in the appendices we present the details of our calculations and numerical quantum chemical calculations supporting our binding mechanism .",
    "the binding between conjugated polymers is a generic property of the mixing of partially filled @xmath1-orbitals .",
    "we treat the electronic component of the interaction using a simple tight - binding model . to introduce a band gap we use the elegant ssh formalism where a peierls instability opens a band gap through a distortion of the one dimensional lattice",
    ". one could introduce similar tight - binding models with a more complex unit cell appropriate for e.g. ppv  @xcite , but such calculations mask the underlying physics of the system in its most straight forward version .",
    "this simplification of the problem has been exploited previously by guo and collaborators , who showed that the ssh model can be used to study other polymers , such as ppv , with a suitable reinterpretation of the model parameters  @xcite .",
    "of course , these chemically distinct systems would produce quantitatively different binding interactions , but our primary findings , e.g. that there is an attractive interaction due to the creation of localized states above and below each band , should be generally insensitive to their chemical details .",
    "the ssh model also allows us to explore in an analytically tractable manner the interaction between inter - chain binding sites and local lattice distortions such as solitons .",
    "these results are also generalizable to other conjugated polymer systems lacking this ground state degeneracy as superpositions of soliton states can be used to model the more general polaron problem in these systems  @xcite .",
    "the ssh hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 here and throughout this article we neglect the dynamics of phonons not associated with the soft phonon mode at the edge of brillouin zone .",
    "we will not consider electron ",
    "phonon scattering , but we will allow for more complex static lattice distortions when computing the interaction of tunneling sites and solitons . here",

    "the inter - chain hopping parameter @xmath17 implicitly includes the effects of the medium and the relative orientation of the chains .",
    "it is also a function of the distance between the linked tight - binding sites with a decay length on the order of a bohr radius .",

    "the impurity potential gives rise to bound states by scattering growing states into decaying states .",
    "in appendix  [ apdx : matrix ] we use a transfer matrix technique to show that the interaction leads to the creation of four bound states as illustrated by the ( red ) dots in fig .  [ fig : crossmodel]a .",
    "two of these states , termed `` ultraband '' states @xcite , appear above the conduction band and below the valance band with energies @xmath25 while the other two appear in the gap and at the edges of the brillouin zone with energies @xmath26 if we assume that @xmath27 we find that , to lowest order , the ultraband states have been shifted away from the band edge by @xmath28 which is unchanged from the metallic case @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the gap states are shifted by @xmath29 . for half - filled chains ,",
    "only the two bound states associated with the valence band will be filled . because the shift of the gap state is smaller than the shift of the ultraband state by @xmath30 for typical parameter values ,",
    "the result is a net lowering of the energy .",
    "the presence of the binding site will also perturb the energy of the extended electron states .",
    "however , as in the metallic case , it can be shown that the total contribution of these states is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the total number of tight - binding sites on the polymer , and therefore can be neglected for long chains @xcite .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : hartree ] we present hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations that verify the qualitative features of this binding mechanism .",
    "these calculations show that the binding energy is of order @xmath33 and that it is sufficiently insensitive to the precise orientation of the polymers to allow for a variety of aggregate morphologies .",
    "since conjugated polymers are semiflexible , it is possible for them to bind in multiple places separated by arc lengths of unbound chains .",
    "two such distant binding sites will experience an effective interaction due to a combination of the change in chain configurational entropy due to the binding constraint , the bending elasticity of the chains , and possibility the electrostatic repulsion of the backbones  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there may be a modification of the binding energy of each binding site due to the interaction of the electronic wavefunctions associated with each of them .",
    "we now study this latter effect by determining the shift in total bound state energy of two binding sites as a function of their separation along the chain .",
    "previously , we demonstrated that the energy shift of an extended state in the presence of a single impurity could be expressed as a series in @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "because the symmetric and anti - symmetric states differ only in the sign of the impurity , the odd terms in this series will cancel .",
    "therefore , after summing over the @xmath35 extended states , the total energy contribution from these states must vanish as @xmath36 .",
    "a second binding site introduces a new length @xmath37 , the distance between the binding sites .",
    "we expect the perturbation series for the extended states to contain terms proportional to @xmath38 , suggesting that the contribution of the extended states may be non - vanishing for long chains .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "taking these effects into account , we determine the interaction energy of two binding sites by direct numerical diagonalization of eqs .",
    "[ eq : transfer ] ; the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twositesd ] .",
    "there is an attractive potential well for the two tunneling sites with a minimum at the separation of @xmath39 . at separations greater than about 10 tight binding sites the binding energy is essentially constant",

    "the tunneling matrix elements are given by @xmath41 ev .",

    ", we expect that the energy shift of a given state to be proportional to the amplitude of that state at the two impurities . therefore , the states perturbed the most by the two impurities separated by distance @xmath37 will be those with a dominant wavenumber @xmath18 that satisfies the relation @xmath45 .",
    "however , the interaction potential induces a phase shift , @xmath46 in the wavefunction .",
    "so , the condition for the maximally perturbed state is actually @xmath47 . because @xmath46 is positive for attractive impurity potentials and negative for repulsive potentials  @xcite",

    "we find that @xmath50 so the states with large negative shifts are filled but the corresponding states with large positive shifts are unoccupied .",
