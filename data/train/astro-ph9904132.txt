    "our poor understanding , especially during the late stages of stellar evolution , of both convection and possible modifications to angular momentum transport by magnetic fields ( not considered in the present work nor in the papers cited above ) suggests that it is worth trying something simple first .",

    "this scenario is speculative at present , since neither the evolution of magnetic instabilities in the stellar interior nor the neutron star kicks have been adequately investigated .",
    "if the large angular momenta obtained for the iron cores in this work pose a problem for pulsars , they are very favorable for the collapsar model for @xmath312-ray bursts @xcite . if the cores of the stars would collapse to a black hole , the angular momentum calculated here would be enough to support matter in a stable disk outside @xcite .",
    "this is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - jlso - e15ab ] , where the distribution of the specific angular momentum at the pre - collapse stage of the two @xmath170 models ` e20 ` and ` e20b ` is shown .",
    "thin dashes and dash - dotted lines indicate the specific angular momenta of the last stable orbit around a non - rotating and a maximum rotating black hole with a mass equal to the mass coordinate . if the matter in the star has more angular momentum than necessary to get into the last stable orbit , an accretion disc must form , and efficiently transform gravitational binding energy into heat , up to @xmath313 of the rest mass for a maximum rotating black hole @xcite .",
    "note that the specific angular momentum displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - jlso - e15ab ] is the latitudinal average over a shell .",
    "its actual value at the equator is higher than that by @xmath314 , while it is zero at the pole .",
    "therefore matter might fall in almost freely along the rotation axis , while it hits the centrifugal barrier at the equator . in case",
    "a prompt supernova explosion fails and a black hole forms instead of a neutron star , this might be a mechanism for an efficient energy source for supernovae or even a @xmath312-ray burst @xcite .",
    "[ sec : sumconcl ]    we have presented the first complete numerical simulation of the evolution of rotating stars from the ignition of nuclear burning until the supernova stage . emphasis has been placed on the modification of the evolution induced by rotation .",
    "this includes an examination of the transport processes responsible for redistributing each angular momentum and composition and the resultant changes that occur in the stellar structure and nucleosynthesis .",
    "the distribution of angular momentum in the presupernova stage is of particular interest .",
    "two different one - dimensional hydrodynamic stellar evolution codes were modified to include angular momentum as a new local variable .",
    "the effects of centrifugal forces on the stellar structure were treated in latitudinally averaged way .",
    "rotationally induced instabilities were included ( sect .",
    "[ sec : mixinst ] ) : secular and dynamic shear instabilities , the solberg - hiland instability , the eddington - sweet circulation , and the goldreich - schubert - fricke instability .",
    "the uncertain parameters of rotationally induced mixing were calibrated using observational constraints on the surface abundances ( sect .",
    "[ sec : calib ] ) . observed surface enrichments with cno - processed matter were reproduced for stars in the mass range from @xmath315 to @xmath173 , for typical initial stellar rotation rates .",
    "stellar mass loss and its dependence on the surface rotation rate were also taken into account ( sect .",
    "[ sec : massloss ] ) .",
    "the evolution of stars of approximately solar composition in the mass range from @xmath178 to @xmath1 was modeled up to iron core collapse , the immediate presupernova stage .",
    "models that used different assumptions regarding the stabilizing effect of gradients in the mean molecular weight on rotationally induced instabilities were computed and compared .",
    "observations indicate that gradients in the mean molecular weight inhibit rotationally induced mixing much less than in the pioneering models of @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by recent investigations of the physics of meridional circulations , shear instabilities , and semiconvective mixing @xcite .      during central hydrogen burning ,",
    "the products of the burning are mixed into the stellar envelope and new fuel is supplied to the convectively burning stellar core by rotationally induced mixing . since this mixing proceeds on a time - scale comparable to the thermonuclear time - scale of hydrogen burning , a gradient of processed matter builds up inside the radiative envelope .",
    "the processed matter has a higher mean molecular weight , @xmath42 , than the pristine matter of the star , and therefore a gradient of the mean molecular weight results .",
    "if rotationally induced mixing occurs by processes that depend sensitively upon these gradients , they act as a barrier ( @xmath42-barrier ) , and mixing between the core and the envelope is inhibited .",
    "exactly when this inhibition becomes important depends on the initial angular momentum of the star .",
    "the amount of mixing that occurs between the core and the envelope is affected accordingly .",
    "mixing inside the envelope also increases for larger initial angular momentum , since the dominant mixing process , eddington - sweet circulation , has an efficiency that increases as the square of the stellar rotation rate .",
    "as the evolution of the star proceeds to later stages , the time - scale for rotationally induced mixing becomes too long in comparison to the evolutionary time - scales to constitute an important source of large - scale mixing .",
    "also , the mixing is not able to dissolve the molecular weight barrier which forms in the core during central helium burning . in general",
    ", rotationally induced mixing does not strongly affect the stellar structure after central helium ignition .",
    "the evolution of the star from this point until core collapse is similar to that of a non - rotating star of same structure at this time , except for the differences in the nucleosynthesis discussed below .    for models where",
    "rotationally induced mixing is assumed to be insensitive to gradients in the mean molecular weight , no @xmath42-barrier inhibits the mixing .",
    "this affects the mixing between the core and the envelope during central hydrogen burning .",
    "the @xmath42-barrier in the superadiabatic part of the core during central helium burning is eroded by shear instabilities .",
    "consequently , the convective core can grow unhindered . as a result , the helium cores are more massive , corresponding to non - rotating stars with about @xmath316 higher initial mass . inside this helium core ,",
    "the co core is also larger than that of a non - rotating star with same helium core mass . towards the end of central helium burning",
    ", fresh helium is mixed into the convective core both by the continuing growth of this core and by rotationally induced mixing .",
    "the fresh helium preferentially converts carbon into oxygen instead of producing new carbon by the triple - alpha process .",
    "this reduces the carbon abundance in the core .",
    "except for this , the effect of rotationally induced mixing is small after helium ignition for the reason outlined above . in particular",
    ", also in this case , the hydrogen burning shell constitutes an efficient barrier for mixing processes  indeed even more efficient , because the core rotates slower as in the case where @xmath42-gradients were considered ( see below ) .",
    "a consequence of the enlarged cores is that the limit on the initial stellar mass for core collapse supernovae is somewhat smaller for higher initial rotation rates .      at central hydrogen ignition ,",
    "the stars establish almost uniform rotation . if a molecular weight barrier forms as hydrogen burning progresses , angular momentum is trapped inside the core and differential rotation results , with up to a factor of @xmath248 variation in the rotation rate between the core and the envelope .",
    "if @xmath42-barriers are unimportant for the rotationally induced mixing , the stars stay close to rigid rotation until the end of central hydrogen burning . since this barrier forms later in the faster rotators",
    ", stars having different initial rotation rates may end up with similar specific angular momenta in the core at the end of central hydrogen burning ( figs .",
    "[ fig : m - wjj53-e15ab ] , [ fig : m - wjj53-gf15b ] and ) . due to angular momentum transport during core helium burning",
    ", they may become even more similar in the pre - collapse stage ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jj15b ] ) .",
    "some angular momentum gets lost from the core during the restructuring that occurs after core hydrogen exhaustion , but during central helium burning the hydrogen - burning shell constitutes an efficient barrier that inhibits the transport of angular momentum out of the core .",
    "even so , the average angular momentum of the core may decrease somewhat , since it grows into regions with lower specific angular momentum on top of it .",
    "the helium core itself stays close to uniform rotation ( figs .",
    "[ fig : m - wjj53-e15ab ] and ) . during central helium burning rotationally induced mixing processes already become slow compared to the evolution , and after core helium exhaustion they do not cause any relevant transport of angular momentum .",
    "only convective processes are rapid enough to notably redistribute angular momentum during the late stages of stellar evolution . within the assumptions made , rigid rotation results in convective regions , transporting angular momentum from their bottom to their top . subsequent phases of convective central and shell burning stages give some outward transport of angular momentum inside the carbon - oxygen core .",
    "since none of the convective shells penetrates through the outer boundary of the co core , the angular momentum remains trapped inside ( figs .",
    "[ fig : m - wjj53-e15ab ] , [ fig : m - wjj53-gf15b ] and ) .",
    "the outer boundary of the helium core constitutes a similar barrier .",
    "this has interesting consequence for the final angular momentum in the core .",
    "first , the different convective burning shells leave their fingerprint not only in the chemical composition , but also in the angular momentum distribution : a spiky profile results at the onset of core collapse ( fig .  [ fig : jj15b ] ) .",
    "the high peaks correspond to the upper edges of the most recently active convection zones and the deep valleys to their bottoms .",
    "shells of similar composition tend to rotate almost rigidly .",
    "second , even the slowest rotating core of the type  ii supernova progenitor stars considered here would result in a neutron star rotating close to break - up if angular momentum were conserved during the collapse .",
    "this is not necessarily in contradiction with observations of young neutron stars in supernova remnants , even though the fastest of these rotates much slower .",
    "these pulsars are already hundreds of years old , and recent theoretical investigations of hot , newly born neutron stars indicate they may spin down to the observed rotation rates within about a year by emitting gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the electro - magnetic radiation emanating from pulsars is trapped inside the supernova ejecta during that time , but the gravitational radiation of these very young neutron stars might become detectable in the future @xcite .",

    "however , during hydrogen burning weak interactions are present , with implications for the energy generation which do not occur in other pre - oxygen burning stages .",
    "in particular , the mass difference of @xmath156@xmath211@xmath317 and @xmath156@xmath211@xmath318 of @xmath319 has to be taken into account .",

    "that is a relative reduction of the energy generation rate of hydrogen burning by @xmath323 .",

    "kepler was also corrected for the appropriate neutrino losses of the three @xmath156@xmath211@xmath339 chains , but they do not contribute in the high - mass stars of the present work .    these two effects sum up to a total reduction of the energy release of hydrogen burning by @xmath340 .",
    "however , this alters the structure of zero - age main sequence stars only slightly , since the energy generation rate for cno hydrogen burning depends on a high power of the temperature ( @xmath341 to @xmath342 ) and thus a slight increase of the central temperature compensates the lower energy generation rate .",

    "the lower total energy release of hydrogen burning reduces the lifetime of the star during central hydrogen burning by about the same factor .",
    "the convective mixing in the core is not affected by the shorter duration of central hydrogen burning , since the convective mixing time - scale is still much shorter . for mixing processes which act on a time - scale comparable to that of central hydrogen burning , e.g. , semiconvection ,",
    "the reduction of the main sequence lifetime can become noticeable .",
    "it is particularly important for rotationally induced mixing and mass loss from the stellar surface .",
    "mass loss rates mostly depend only on stellar surface properties ( sect .",
    "[ sec : massloss ] ) and thus , to first approximation , the total mass loss scales with the evolutionary time - scale . the stellar angular momentum loss from the surface",
    "is also altered by this and the amount of products of hydrogen burning exposed to the surface of the star depends on both the time available for the rotationally induced mixing processes to transport them to the surface and the amount of matter removed from the surface .",
    "furthermore , a higher angular momentum loss from the surface can introduce more shear and correspondingly more mixing .",
    "after termination of core hydrogen burning , hydrogen continues burning in a shell above the helium core . since the stellar structure determines the rate at which energy has to be released by hydrogen burning , more hydrogen is burned in order to release the same amount of energy using the corrected energy generation rate .",
    "this increases the rate at which the helium core grows and thus its final size .    in all models computed with kepler in the present work ,",
    "the corrected treatment of hydrogen burning was employed .",

    "the time - axis gives the logarithm of the time left until core collapse ( in @xmath343 ) . from the infall velocities occurring in the last computed models and from the radius at which the maximum infall velocity occurs ( @xmath344 and @xmath345 , respectively ) we estimated @xmath346 ( @xmath347 ) for the time until `` core bounce '' .    the @xmath348-axis gives the ( interior ) mass coordinate , @xmath131 , in units of the solar mass .",
    "the total mass of the star is indicated by a thick solid line and shows the mass loss from the stellar surface .",
