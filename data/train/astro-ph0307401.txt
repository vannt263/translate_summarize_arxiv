    "star - forming , extremely metal - poor galaxies ( xmpgs ) in the nearby universe have received much attention , since some of these objects may be primeval galaxies that are now experiencing their first major burst of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "xmpgs are characterized by low nebular oxygen abundances ( 12+log(o / h )  @xmath0  7.65 ; e.g. , kunth & stlin 2000 , hereafter k00 ) .",
    "although there have been a number of special emission - line surveys for xmpgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , very few objects of this class are known .",
    "combining measurements based on different methods from a variety of sources compiled by k00 with the recent studies by @xcite and @xcite gives a total of @xmath10 currently known or suspected xmpgs .",
    "the majority of these galaxies are starbursting blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) , while the remainder are more quiescently evolving low - surface - brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) including dwarf irregulars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "little is known about the census , formation conditions , and evolutionary status of the different types of xmpgs .",
    "we have therefore begun a systematic search for xmpgs using the spectroscopic database of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the sdss @xcite is an imaging and spectroscopic survey that will eventually cover about one quarter of the sky ( more than 4000 deg@xmath3 have been imaged to date ) .",
    "after drift - scan imaging in five bandpasses @xcite photometry pipelines measure photometric and astrometric properties @xcite and identify candidate galaxies and quasars for multi - fibre spectroscopy .",
    "each plate has 640 fibers , yielding 608 spectra of galaxies , quasars and stars and 32 sky spectra per pointing @xcite .",
    "the fibers have a diameter of @xmath11 .",
    "the spectra cover a wavelength range of 3800   to 9200   with a resolution of @xmath12 .",
    "the sdss takes spectra of a magnitude - limited sample of galaxies ( mainly field galaxies brighter than @xmath13 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a color - selected sample of quasars @xcite .",
    "these include a substantial number of emission - line galaxies .",
    "the spectra are automatically reduced and wavelength- and flux - calibrated ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and http://www.sdss.org/dr1/algorithms for more details ) .",
    "owing to its homogeneity , area coverage , and depth , the sdss provides an excellent means of creating a flux - limited sample of xmpgs . in this letter",
    "we report the discovery of eight new xmpgs and the recovery of four previously known or suspected xmpgs . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe our analysis methods and the determination of oxygen abundances . in section 3",
    "we present our results and discuss them . in section 3 ,",
    "our findings are summarized . throughout the paper a hubble constant of h@xmath14",
    "= 75 km@xmath15s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 is adopted .",
    "for our work we used reduced spectra from @xmath17 separate plates resulting in a total sample of @xmath18 objects with galaxy spectra .",
    "approximately 10% of these plates were observed more than once , thus the above spectra also include galaxies with multiple observations .",
    "the total area on the sky covered by the analyzed sdss spectroscopic database is @xmath23000 deg@xmath3 . for the analysis of the sdss spectra we used our own software for emission - line data , which was created for the hamburg / sao survey for emission - line galaxies ( hss - elg ;",
    "* and references therein ) and for the hamburg / sao survey for low metallicity galaxies ( hss - lm ; * ? ? ?",
    "all emission lines were re - measured using a method detailed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the continuum was determined with the help of an algorithm described in detail by @xcite .",
    "we extracted a galaxy sample comprised only of objects with strong emission lines ( rest frame h@xmath19 equivalent widths ew(h@xmath20  20  ) .",
    "our selection procedure for galaxies with strong emission lines will be described in detail in @xcite .",
    "our ew(h@xmath21 selection is motivated by the requirement to measure ( 1 ) the weak [ oiii ] @xmath54363   emission line ( whose intensity is usually @xmath22 ) for a direct calculation of the electron temperature , @xmath23 , and ( 2 ) the [ oii ] @xmath57319,7330   lines ( usually @xmath24 ) needed for the o@xmath25/h@xmath25 determination .",
    "these direct measurements tend to be possible only for spectra with sufficiently large balmer emission equivalent widths .",
    "while spectra obtained with fibre - fed spectrographs may be difficult to correct for atmospheric dispersion effects @xcite , these problems are reduced for compact objects such as the hii regions in our target galaxies .",
    "we find this confirmed by the excellent agreement between our measured parameters and previously published values for already known xmpgs that we recovered from the sdss data ( see below ) .",
    "the sdss spectra presented here were taken at airmasses of @xmath26 , which further reduces dispersion effects .",
    "the abundances of the ionized species and the total oxygen abundance have been obtained with the method described by @xcite , and @xcite , which was also used for the galaxies from the hss - elg and hss - lm projects .",
    "the uncertainties of the measurements of line intensities , continua , extinction coefficients , and balmer absorption equivalent widths have been propagated to derive the uncertainties of the element abundances . for objects with @xmath27  0.024",
    ", the sdss spectra do not include the [ oii ] @xmath53727   line , and hence the so - called `` direct method '' mentioned above can not be used . nor is it possible to use empirical r23 methods ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) , since all of them require the [ oii ] @xmath53727   line .",
    "however , as shown and tabulated by @xcite for @xmath28 configurations , the measured intensities of the auroral lines [ oii ] @xmath57319,7330 may be used instead to determine o@xmath25/h@xmath25 .",
    "the resulting o@xmath25/h@xmath25 values should be the same with both methods , but since the total intensities of the [ oii ] @xmath57319,7330 lines are much fainter than the [ oii ] @xmath53727   line , the application of the auroral line method is restricted to sdss spectra with sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio . to test the accuracy of our abundance determinations we calculated oxygen abundances using both the [ oii ] @xmath57319,7330   line method and the direct method for spectra with @xmath29  0.024 .",
    "in addition , we compared our results with those for galaxies in common with the studies quoted in the preceding paragraph .",
    "the published oxygen abundances of the famous xmpg i  zw  18 range from 7.05 to 7.2 in the northwest ( nw ) component along its major axis ( see the figure 5 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and from 7.2 to 7.3 in the southeast ( se ) component .",
    "both of these components were targeted by sdss spectroscopy , and our measured oxygen abundances agree within the cited uncertainties with the previous results ( see table  [ tbl : main_par ] ) .",
    "the oxygen abundance for hs  0822@xmath13542 is 7.44@xmath300.06 according to @xcite and is in excellent agreement with our value of 7.45@xmath300.02 . for hs  0837@xmath14717 , 12+log(o / h ) = 7.64@xmath300.04 @xcite , which agrees with our sdss abundance of 7.62@xmath300.02 calculated with the [ oii ] @xmath53727   line , and with our abundance of 7.63@xmath300.03 determined using the [ oii ] @xmath57319,7330   lines .",
    "finally , for our newly discovered xmpg sdss j0519@xmath10007 we find 12+log(o / h ) = 7.46 with either method , although the value obtained using [ oii ] @xmath57319,7330   has a larger uncertainty . we conclude that sdss spectra permit accurate oxygen abundance determinations over a studied range of 7.10 @xmath0 12+log(o / h ) @xmath0 7.65 , and that the auroral line method appears to yield reliable results .",
    "our survey led to the discovery of eight previously unknown xmpgs . in figure  [ fig : sdss_spectra ] we show their sdss spectra .",
    "table  [ tbl : main_par ] lists the properties of the new xmpgs as well as previously known xmpgs in the same area that were recovered by our programs and that have an abundance accuracy @xmath31 dex .",
    "column 1 gives the sdss names derived from the j2000 coordinates of the fiber positions .",
    "columns 2 and 3 contain the sdss petrosian integrated @xmath32 and @xmath9 magnitudes .",
    "column 4 lists a preliminary morphological classification following k00 , column 5 sdss redshifts @xmath33 , column 6 oxygen abundances 12+log(o / h ) with their uncertainties , and column 7 gives alternative galaxy names where available from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) . in table",
    "[ tbl : spectra ] we present the corrected relative fluxes of lines used for the calculation of oxygen abundances , and their uncertainties .    in spite of three decades of searches for xmpgs , very few such objects are currently known .",
    "the new galaxies presented here increase the number of reliably known xmpgs by approximately one quarter , an important step in efforts to establish a comprehensive list of very metal - deficient galaxies with well - defined , uniform selection criteria and to study their group properties .",
    "our sample of new xmpgs contains the most distant and most luminous xmpg found so far ( sdss j0519@xmath10007 ; d@xmath2177mpc , m@xmath34 ) .",
    "sdss j1215 + 5223 , on the other hand , is one of the closest xmpgs if one simply converts its redshift into distance ( 2.1 mpc ) , although the caveat of peculiar velocities should be kept in mind for objects with distances of just a few mpc @xcite .",
    "the identification of very nearby xmpgs is of special importance since these objects permit detailed studies of their resolved star formation histories and of their overall age .",
    "the xmpgs found in the sdss data cover a wide range of abundances ( 7.15 to 7.65 ) , redshifts ( @xmath35 ) , and luminosities ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "none of our new xmpgs is as metal - poor as i  zw  18 ( which is among the xmpgs recovered in the sdss data ) or sbs 0335@xmath7052 , which remain the most metal - deficient , star - forming galaxies known to - date .",
    "xmpgs span at least 6 magnitudes in blue luminosity , suggesting possible atypical evolutionary histories for the most luminous objects , since they do not follow the `` standard '' luminosity - metallicity ( l - z ) relation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : l - zrel ] , where the new and the previously known xmpgs are plotted .",
    "while the lsbgs ( primarily dwarf irregulars , dirrs ) tend to scatter around the l - z relation previously measured for dirrs @xcite , most of the new and previously known very metal - deficient bcgs appear to be too luminous for their low present - day metallicities .",
    "the gas - deficient , quiescent dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies would show the opposite trend if added to this plot : they appear subluminous for their low metallicity as compared to dirrs ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "these differences are not merely a bias introduced by the blue luminosity s sensitivity to present - day activity ; in fact , the immediate cessation of all star formation activity and subsequent passive fading would still require more than a hubble time to erase the differences in luminosity ( grebel et al .",
    "2003 ) . an interesting , yet",
    "controversial scenario is the possibility that xmpgs that clearly deviate from the l - z relation are truly young galaxies , unenriched because they are now undergoing their first episodes of star formation .",
    "the nearest xmpgs for which detailed stellar population studies are available are all dirrs within @xmath37 mpc around the local group .",
    "they generally comply with the l - z relation and contain old stellar populations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "deep hst imaging of nearby bcgs ( typically at distances @xmath38 mpc ) shows that star formation has progressed for at least several gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but for more distant bcgs such as the famous izw18 , the age question remains unsolved ( compare , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the older populations in izw18 as well as in at least half of the new xmpgs of our sample should be resolvable with the advanced camera for surveys aboard the hubble space telescope , which should allow us to settle the question of delayed star formation soon .",
    "if bcgs underwent slow astration for most of their history , resulting in slow enrichment similar to that observed in dirrs , and are now experiencing their first major starburst , then it is conceivable that this change in their mode of star formation was triggered by interactions with companion galaxies , or possibly primordial gas clouds .",
    "alternatively , dwarf galaxies with particularly violent , bursty star formation episodes may suffer significant metal loss through winds from massive stars and supernova ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these different evolutionary scenarios result in predictions that can be tested via , for instance , optical , radio , and x - ray follow - up observations .",
    "an increased sample of xmpgs with well - defined , uniform selection criteria as provided by the sdss is crucial for uncovering their individual and group properties .    by confining our search to galaxies with strong balmer emission",
    "we ensure that we only include galaxies for which very accurate , direct oxygen abundance measurements based on the temperature - sensitive [ oiii ] @xmath54363   line and on the direct calculation of the electron temperature are possible . with these constraints",
    ", we find a surface density of xmpgs of @xmath39 per 1000 deg@xmath3 for @xmath9 @xmath4 1777 and 12+log(o / h )  @xmath0  7.65 .",
    "extrapolating to the full anticipated sdss survey area , we expect to detect at least 20 additional galaxies once the sdss is completed .",
