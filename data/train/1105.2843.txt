    "understanding the ground state properties of spin systems on a lattice is of central importance in many - body physics , but at the same time , it is a highly challenging problem in many scenarios .",
    "an important step in understanding its difficulty has been the insight that computing e.g.  the ground state energy of a classical spin system is , in general , an complete problem  @xcite : while the energy of any given spin configuration can be easily computed , finding the configuration with minimal energy is in general a difficult task  it can be as hard as any problem in , i.e. , any problem whose solution can be efficiently verified . for quantum spin systems , an additional difficulty arises : generally , we can not even expect to have an efficient description of the ground state .",
    "thus , it seems that the only statement we can make about the difficulty of the problem is that given a quantum register with the ground state , we will be able to efficiently estimate its energy using a quantum computer .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that this is the best we can say , as the problem of estimating the ground state energy of a quantum system is a complete problem for the class  @xcite , the quantum analogue of : it contains all problems which have a quantum solution which can be efficiently checked on a quantum computer , and thus , determining the ground state energy of a quantum spin system is as hard as any of these problems ; in fact , the problem retains its hardness even when restricted to two - dimensional lattices of qubits with nearest - neighbor interactions  @xcite or one - dimensional chains  @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting question to understand the reasons underlying the additional complexity of quantum spin systems as compared to classical systems . to this end ,",
    "restricted version of the problem which lie between classical and general quantum spin hamiltonians have been studied : for instance , it has been shown that so - called _ stoquastic _ hamiltonians , where all off - diagonal elements are negative , have a complexity which lies in between and , as those systems can be related to classical random processes  @xcite ; in fact , these are exactly the hamiltonians which allow for quantum monte carlo simulations as they do not exhibit a sign problem .",
    "another restricted class of hamiltonians are _ commuting hamiltonians _ , that is , hamiltonians which can be written as a sum of mutually commuting few - body terms . for those systems",
    ", all terms can be simultaneously diagonalized , just as for classical systems ; however , the corresponding eigenbasis can be highly entangled , making it unclear whether a useful classical description of the ground state can be provided .",
    "in fact , commuting hamiltonians encompass systems which exhibit rich non - classical physics , in particular models with topological order and even anyonic excitations , such as kitaev s toric code and quantum double models  @xcite , or levin and wen s string net models  @xcite .",
    "commuting hamiltonians are also of interest since the fixed points of renormalization flows in gapped phases are expected to be commuting hamiltonians , and thus understanding their structure might give insight into the structure of gapped quantum phases . finally , understanding the complexity of commuting hamiltonians is of interest in quantum complexity , as it might be a step towards a quantum pcp theorem , which would assess how the difficulty of estimating the ground state energy is related to the desired accuracy which is integer for commuting projectors .    what is know about the complexity of finding the ground state energy of commuting hamiltonians , or rather , of determining whether the ground state minimizes each term in the hamiltonian individually  the commuting hamiltonian problem ? for lattices in two and higher dimensions , commuting hamiltonian is an hard problem , as it e.g.  encompasses the ising model on a planar graph  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear whether the general commuting hamiltonian problem is _ inside _ , since it is not clear in general how to provide an efficiently checkable description of the ground state . for two - local ( i.e. , two - body ) hamiltonians , bravyi and vyalyi  @xcite",
    "have shown that the problem is in by using @xmath0algebraic techniques ( their result also implies that one - dimensional commuting hamiltonians are efficiently solvable ) ; subsequently , aharonov and eldar  @xcite have proven containment in for hamiltonians with three - body interactions both for qubits on arbitrary graphs , and qutrits on nearly - euclidean interaction graphs .",
    "in both of these works , the classical certificates do not only prove the problem to be in , but can in fact be used to construct constant depth quantum circuits which _ prepare _ the ground state .",
    "this , in particular , implies that the corresponding hamiltonians  including qutrits with three - body interactions  can not exhibit topological order  @xcite . on the other hand , kitaev s toric code , which is the ground state of a commuting hamiltonian with four - body interactions of qubits ,",
    "does have topological order , and thus , we can not expect any approach which yields a low - depth circuit to work beyond three qutrits .    in this paper",
    ", we study the commuting hamiltonian problem on a square lattice of qubits with plaquette - wise interactions , and prove that it is in .",
    "that is , we consider a square lattice of qubits , with a hamiltonian with mutually commuting terms acting on the four qubits adjacent to each plaquette , and show that the problem of deciding whether its ground state minimizes the energy of each local term in the hamiltonian is in : i.e. , in case the ground state has this property , a classical certificate exists which can be checked efficiently by a quantum computer .",
    "our approach differs considerably from the aforementioned approaches in that the certificate can not be used to devise a quantum circuit for preparing the ground state , and is thus also applicable to systems with topological order ; it should be noted that the same holds true for the proof in ref .",
    "@xcite that commuting hamiltonian with factorizing projectors is in .",
    "we will consider a 2d square lattice with spins on the vertices , and either open or periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath1 consists of plaquette terms @xmath2 which act on the four spins adjacent to the plaquette @xmath3 , and we impose that all the terms in the hamiltonian commute , @xmath4=0\\ \\forall\\,p , q$ ] .",
    "as the hamiltonian terms commute , there is a basis of eigenstates of @xmath5 which are simultaneously eigenstates of all the @xmath2 .",
    "we would like to know the computational difficulty of the following problem , called commuting hamiltonian : is there an eigenstate @xmath6 of @xmath5 which minimizes the energies for all @xmath2 individually , i.e. , are the ground states of @xmath5 also ground states of each @xmath2 ? in the following , we will show that in the case of qubits , the existence of such a state can be proven within , i.e. , there is a classical certificate which proves the existence of such a @xmath6 , and which can be checked efficiently classically .",
    "note that on the other hand , it is clear that the problem is hard , as it e.g.  encompasses classical ising spin glasses in a field which are known to be hard even for two - level systems  @xcite .    for the following",
    ", it will be useful to reformulate commuting hamiltonian as follows : define the _ local ground state projectors _",
    "@xmath7 as the projectors onto the ground state subspace of @xmath2 ; the @xmath7 commute again , @xmath8=0 $ ]",
    ". then , @xmath9 is the projector onto the subspace spanned by the states which are ground states of all @xmath2 . since commuting",
    "hamiltonian asks whether such states exist , it is equivalent to asking whether @xmath10 .",
    "we start by coloring the plaquettes of the square lattice black and white in a checkerboard pattern , and denote the set of black and white plaquettes by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath13 be the projectors onto the joint ground state space of the black and white @xmath2 , respectively ; then , commuting hamiltonian corresponds to determining whether @xmath14 .",

    "a helpful example to keep in mind in the first part of our discussion is kitaev s toric code  @xcite : there , @xmath18 for @xmath19 , and @xmath20 for @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 the pauli matrices .      in the following ,",

    "@xcite is the structure of two commuting projectors .",
