    "the interaction of intense fields with plasmas is an important hotspot issue in plasma physics , which is involved in many area , for example the excitation of wakefield , laser - plasma acceleration , fast ignition fusion[1 - 7 ] , etc .",
    "a laser pulse can excite a plasma wave via the effect of ponderomotive force when propagating through a plasma , and motions of electrons and photons in plasmas are also modulated by this plasma wave . in the interaction process the laser - plasma system can be described by the maxwell - fluid theory which has achieved huge success in the last two decades[8 - 16 ] .    on the viewpoint of corpuscular theory an electromagnetic field interacting with plasmas can be treated as a nonequilibrium photon system governed by the kinetic equation , which is called as photon kinetic theory[17 - 19 ] .",
    "based on the photon kinetic theory the dynamical behavior of a single photon in a background plasma can be extended to the evolution of the entire photon system . as a special photon system",
    ", laser pulse has a lot of advantages compared with other electromagnetic radiations , such as good directivity , high intensity and narrow spectrum width , etc .",
    "we can treat the laser pulse as an ordered photon current described by the kinetic theory .",
    "the connection between the photon system and a single photon is the photon number distribution in phase space which is essentially the statistical weight of photons with various modes in the entire photon system .",
    "the evolution of an electromagnetic radiation in plasmas can be derived by making weighted average to all photon behaviors . due to the photon kinetic theory being a very effective method for describing the propagation properties of electromagnetic fields in plasmas ,",
    "the research on single photon dynamics is worth trying .",
    "there are some similarities between photon and electron behaviors in plasma waves .",
    "for instance , if the photon velocity matches with the phase velocity of the plasma wave , the photon can be accelerated effectively by the plasma wave[20 - 23 ] and the photon system can produce landau collisionless damping to the plasma wave[24 - 26 ] , etc . , and so do the electrons[27 - 31 ] .",
    "however the differences are obvious .",
    "the photon is not influenced by the electrostatic field of the plasma wave because of the electric neutrality , whereas the electron is .",
    "the propagation behavior of photons in plasmas is related to the refractive index , i.e. , electron number density of the plasma .",
    "the refractive index of a plasma can be equivalent to a special potential field acting on photons , and photons will get some equivalent forces when moving in this potential field just as electrons are affected by the electrostatic forces in plasma waves . in this sense ,",
    "the dynamical evolution of a single photon in a plasma is determined by the electron number density of the plasma . in inhomogeneous plasma the equivalent forces acting on photons depend on their positions in the plasma , and the photons with different modes",
    "are also influenced by different forces owing to dispersion effects .",

    "let us consider one dimensional model for simplicity , and suppose that the electromagnetic wave propagates along @xmath0 axis .",
    "in this paper we assume that the intensity of the electromagnetic wave is not strong enough to change the configuration of the plasma wave prominently so that the reaction from the electromagnetic wave ( or the photon system ) to the plasma wave can be ignored .",
    "when an electromagnetic wave propagates in a plasma wave , the disturbed electron number density modulates the frequency @xmath1 and wave vector @xmath2 of the electromagnetic wave to produce frequency shifting , which can be described by the maxwell wave theory . nevertheless , we will discuss this problem in an alternative way . by considering the electromagnetic wave as a system of photon gas ,",
    "let us discuss the kinetic evolution of a single photon in a plasma wave .",
    "if the amplitude of a plasma wave is small , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the disturbed electron number density and @xmath5 is the ambient plasma density , the photon kinetics can be expressed by perturbation expansion : @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath0 and @xmath10 are the position and velocity of the photon , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are regarded as the energy and momentum of the photon .",

    "an electromagnetic radiation can be regarded as a particle system composed of photons with various modes .",
    "the evolution behavior of entire electromagnetic radiation in plasmas can be derived by making statistical summation of all photon behaviors in theory .",
    "now we will discuss energy exchanging of the electromagnetic wave with the plasma wave based on the photon dynamics , which is a kind of collective effect of photon system known as photon landau damping .",
    "taking the derivative of eq.(12 ) with respect to time @xmath31 , the average rate of energy change of the photon to second - order in plasma wave is given by @xmath40 here the dot stands for the derivative with respect to the time , and the bracket @xmath41 denotes the average over initial position @xmath42 in one wavelength range of the plasma wave .",
    "the first - order correction of photon velocity can be obtained from dynamical equation eq.(6 ) as @xmath43 the integral of eq.(16 ) gives @xmath44-\\frac{c^{2}\\omega_{p0}^{4}k_{pl}\\kappa}{2\\omega_{0}^{4}\\omega}t\\cos\\left(k_{pl}x_{0}\\right).\\ ] ] substituting eqs.(9)-(11 ) , ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) into eq.(15 ) we get @xmath45    in order to extend the rate of energy change of the photon to the whole electromagnetic field we need to computer the sum of all photons in the field .",
    "supposing that the initial photon number distribution is @xmath46 , the average rate of energy change of the electromagnetic field is given by @xmath47 eq.(18 ) indicates that @xmath48 is oscillatory and damped rapidly , excepting at the resonance singularity @xmath49 .",
    "thus the main contribution in eq.(19 ) comes from the area nearby the singularity , which can be worked out by considering the long time limit and expressed in terms of a delta function @xmath50 where @xmath51 is resonance frequency of the photon with the plasma wave as defined by @xmath52 . since @xmath53",
    ", we obtain @xmath54.\\ ] ] inserting eq.(21 ) into eq.(19 ) the average rate of energy change of the electromagnetic field in plasma wave is expressed by @xmath55 eq.(22 ) indicates a mechanism of energy exchange of the electromagnetic wave with plasma wave .",
    "the frequency @xmath51 can be regarded as the resonance frequency because the photon with this frequency has the velocity matching with the phase velocity of the plasma wave . from eq.(22 ) we find that the energy exchange is determined by the derivative of the distribution function of photon number near @xmath51 , and if the slope of this distribution function is steeper the energy exchange is more remarkable .",
    "that just means only the photons having the frequencies close to the resonance frequency are involved in this process of energy exchange with the plasma wave . from the preceding discussion it is clear that the energy exchange is not related to collisions between photons and electrons .",
    "thus the mechanism of the energy exchange here is a collisionless resonance effect between photon system and the plasma wave , namely the photon landau damping[24,25 ] .",
    "photon landau damping has some properties in common with electron landau damping : both are collective velocity resonance phenomena with plasma waves .",
    "however the differences between them are obvious .",
    "the energy exchange in the process of electron landau damping is achieved through doing work to electrons by the electrostatic field . but photons are electrically neutral and not influenced by the electrostatic force . in fact",
    "the energy exchange in photon landau damping is achieved through the effect of photon frequency shift in plasma wave that is related to the fluctuation of the electron number density .",

    "now we will discuss the situation of the plasma wave with arbitrary amplitude .",
    "it is more convenient to perform a coordinate transformation from the laboratory frame to a new frame : @xmath74 , @xmath75 . in this new frame",
    "the shape of plasma wave has a simpler expression as @xmath76 , and the photon dynamical equations are derived from eq.(6 ) and ( 7 ) as @xmath77 @xmath78 in eq.(31 ) we have canceled the photon momentum @xmath2 by using of the dispersion relation of electromagnetic wave in plasmas . combining eqs.(30 ) and ( 31 ) the time @xmath79 can be canceled and the evolution equation of photon in @xmath80 space is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "here we also call the @xmath80 space as the phase space for convenience",
    ". the solution of eq.(32 ) is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a constant determined uniquely by the initial condition @xmath86 in eq.(34 ) @xmath87 depends on the initial photon frequency and @xmath88 is determined by the initial position of the photon injected into the plasma wave as @xmath89 .",
    "eq.(33 ) indicates that @xmath90 is an invariant as long as the initial conditions are given . from eq.(33 ) the photon frequency",
    "is obtained as @xmath91 which describes the evolution trajectory of a photon in phase space .    in eq.(35 ) the notations `` @xmath92 '' denotes the two different branches of the trajectory in phase space , which represents the evolutions of photons with two different kinds of initial conditions .",
    "the sign `` @xmath93 '' stands for the upper branch and `` @xmath94 '' denotes the lower branch .",
    "we also suppose the plasma wave has the shape of cosine , @xmath95 , for simplicity .",
    "the photon evolution trajectory in phase space expressed by eq.(35 ) is illustrated in fig.1 , and the similar result was numerically obtained in ref.22 .        according to the different initial conditions the evolution trajectory can be divided into two types : the first one is displayed as the dotted line in fig.1 , where the upper and lower branches intersect with each other to form a closed trajectory .",

    "in this situation the photon evolves only on one branch and propagates through different periods of the plasma wave , so it is obviously not trapped by the plasma wave . if the photon is on the upper branch of the trajectory at the initial time , it will always evolve on the upper branch with the motion velocity faster than the phase velocity of the plasma wave . whereas the photon will evolve on the lower branch and propagate backward with respect to the plasma wave if its initial position is on the lower branch in phase space . in fig.1",
    "the solid line denotes the separatrix between trajectories of trapped and untrapped photons .",
    "whether the photon can be trapped is determined by initial conditions .",
    "we have known that the trapped photon has the closed evolution trajectory , that is to say the factor under the square root sign in eq.(35 ) @xmath96 is solvable .",
    "then we get the trapped condition for photons in plasma wave as @xmath97 all the photons with initial conditions satisfying inequality ( 37 ) can be trapped by the plasma wave .",
    "the trapped photons have the velocity matching with the phase velocity of plasma wave , and can exchange energy effectively with the plasma wave .",
    "let us discuss the motion equation of photons in coordinate space .",

    "we will analyze the motion equation of trapped photon first .",
    "the maximum and minimum frequencies of the trapped photon in plasma wave can be obtained from eq.(35 ) and given by @xmath100 the initial conditions of the trapped photon satisfy inequality ( 37 ) , which gives @xmath101 , and then the motion equation ( 39 ) is simplified into @xmath102 with @xmath103 the integral function in eq.(41 ) can be expressed by the elliptic integral of the first kind @xmath104 .",
    "for simplicity we only discuss the motion equation in the first period , the evolution after the first period can be worked out analogously .",
    "assuming that the photon is on the upper branch of the trajectory in phase space at the initial time , the motion trajectory before the photon going into the lower branch is derived by using eq.(41 ) as @xmath105.\\ ] ] and then , the photon reaches the lower branch and the motion equation is given by @xmath106,\\ ] ] where @xmath107 determined by @xmath108 is the maximum position the photon can reach . at last",

    "the velocity of this type of photon is always slower than the phase velocity of the plasma wave , and the photon moves backward with respect to the plasma wave .        in fig.5",

    "in this paper some dynamical behaviors of photons and collective effect of photon system in plasma wave are described in the unified frame of the photon dynamical theory .",
    "we treat the plasma wave as a special background for photons , and the refractive index of the plasma is equivalent to an external potential field which determines the dynamical evolution of photons .",
    "the dynamical equations of photons are constructed in hamiltonian formulation in the approximation of geometrical optics .",
    "we solve the dynamical equations and analyze some motion behaviors of photons in plasma wave , including photon acceleration and trapping effects , the evolution trajectory in phase space and photon landau damping to the plasma wave .",
    "in fact the photon trapping effect in plasma wave is related to the photon acceleration .",
    "only when the photon velocity is close to the phase velocity of plasma wave , the trapping phenomenon occurs , which is analogous to the electron trapping effect in a plasma wave . whether a photon can be accelerated to a velocity that matches with the phase velocity of a given plasma wave is determined by the initial conditions . the trapping condition and possibility of photons in a given plasma wave",
    "are analysed in detail in this paper . in a small - amplitude plasma wave ,",
    "the evolution behavior of a single photon is extended to the entire electromagnetic field to calculate the collisionless landau damping effect originated from the electromagnetic field .",
    "when the plasma wave gets a relativistic phase velocity , for example a plasma wave driven by a laser pulse , some photons of the electromagnetic field can propagate with velocities very close to the phase velocity of the plasma wave and be trapped by the plasma wave , and consequently the velocity resonance with plasma wave occurs .",
    "the energy can be exchanged effectively between the electromagnetic field and the plasma wave in this resonance process .",
    "if we consider the electromagnetic field as a laser pulse , due to the narrow spectrum width most photons in the pulse may resonate with the plasma wave to produce the photon landau damping effect .    theoretically , if we know the dynamical evolutions of photons in plasma waves , the evolution properties of the laser pulse can be obtained by making statistical summation of all photon behaviors , in which the keypoint is the weight factor of photons with different modes in entire pulse , i.e. , photon number distribution . in a small - amplitude plasma wave",
    "the modulation on photon motion by the plasma wave is so weak that photon number distribution can be considered as a invariant , so we can use the initial pulse distribution as the statistical weight and keep it unchanged .",
    "however in a large - amplitude plasma wave the photon motion is significantly modulated and the photon number distribution evolves to obey the kinetic equation .",
    "consequently , it is also an important problem to solve the photon kinetic equation in a large - amplitude plasma wave so as to obtain the time - dependent photon number distribution in phase space[32 ] .",
    "the photon dynamics plays an important role in the research of the interaction of electromagnetic field with plasma wave based on the corpuscular theory of light . by combining the kinetic theory of photon system and the single photon dynamics",
    ", the evolution of an electromagnetic field in a given plasma wave can be well - described in a different method from the maxwell wave theory .",
