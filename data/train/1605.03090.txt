    "glial brain cells play important and diverse roles regulating the dynamics and structure of neural networks @xcite , including learning - related changes in synapses @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on one of the most important functions thought to be served by the glial network  the transport and distribution of metabolic resources among the neural synapses @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis originated from early anatomical studies which showed that the glia form a bridge between the neural synapses and the brain vasculature @xcite ( fig  [ fig : resource_glia_neuron]a ) .",
    "more recently , experiments have directly demonstrated that glia , astrocytes more specifically , deliver metabolic resources to synapses depending on how active the synapses are @xcite .",
    "en route to the synapses , these resources diffuse through an extensive network of astrocytes @xcite .",
    "the biophysical properties of such diffusive transport of resources may have a fundamental influence on the dynamics of the activity of the neural network that consumes the resources @xcite .",
    "for example , a highly active synapse may consume all of its local resources , thus forcing it to become less active until more resources arrive , and may drain resources away from less active synapses , thus shaping functional differences among synapses . here , in order to study these possibilities , we introduce a computational model incorporating both a neural network and a glial network .",
    "our model neurons interact via synapses whose efficacy evolves according to activity - dependent learning rules , namely spike timing dependent plasticity ( stdp ) @xcite . under many circumstances , modeling of stdp",
    "can result in unstable growth of synaptic efficacy and typically requires additional types of learning rules to prevent such runaway growth ( see discussion in the conclusion section and refs .",
    "the main finding of our work is that diffusive transport of resources via the glial network can serve to prevent runaway synaptic growth due to stdp , thereby maintaining stable neural network dynamics .",
    "we show that this phenomenon requires resource transport among the glia ; locally confined production and consumption of resources result in unstable neural network dynamics .",
    "the known roles played by the glia in synaptic plasticity are diverse and numerous @xcite , but , to our knowledge , our work is the first to show that metabolic resource distribution can play such a stabilizing role .",
    "more broadly , it is interesting to note the very general finding that many complex systems arising in diverse fields ( e.g. , social interactions , biology , information science , etc . )",
    "are founded upon interactions between two or more identifiable networks .",
    "for a recent review with useful further references and examples see ref .",
    "our work in the present paper provides a compelling example of the potential dynamical benefit of this type of structure in the architecture of the brain .",
    "as shown in fig [ fig : resource_glia_neuron]b , our model consists of a two - layered network whose first layer is a weighted and directed neural network and whose second layer is an unweighted undirected glial network .",
    "the neural network is composed of @xmath0 excitable nodes that represent neurons , labeled @xmath1 , and @xmath2 directed edges , labeled @xmath3 on which synapses are located .",
    "the state @xmath4 of neuron @xmath5 at a discrete time step @xmath6 is represented either as @xmath7 ( quiescent ) or @xmath8 ( active ) .",
    "we define @xmath9 as the @xmath10 adjacency matrix whose entry @xmath11 denotes the weight of the synapse on the edge from neuron @xmath12 to neuron @xmath5 at time @xmath6 .",
    "any presynaptic neuron @xmath12 can be either excitatory ( @xmath13 ) or inhibitory ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "thus , if we let @xmath15 denote the absolute value of synapse strength , then @xmath16 .    at each time step @xmath6 ( where @xmath17 ) , the state of neuron @xmath5 is updated probabilistically based on the sum of its synaptic input from active presynaptic neurons in the previous time step , @xmath18 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the model transfer function probability @xmath19 is piecewise linear ; @xmath20 for @xmath21 , @xmath22 for @xmath23 , and @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "the second layer of our model , the unweighted and undirected glial network , consists of @xmath26 glial cells labeled @xmath27 .",
    "each glial cell @xmath28 holds an amount of resource @xmath29 at time step @xmath6 .",
    "while in this paper we do not focus on a particular resource , we note that various metabolites are transported diffusively among the glial cells such as glucose and lactate @xcite .",
    "resources diffuse between the glial cells that are connected to each other .",
    "we define a @xmath30 symmetric glial adjacency matrix @xmath31 such that entry @xmath32 if glial cell @xmath33 is connected to glial cell @xmath28 and @xmath34 otherwise .",
    "each glial cell serves a set of synapses by supplying resource to them .",
    "hence we define a @xmath35 matrix @xmath36 with entries @xmath37 if glial cell @xmath28 serves synapse @xmath38 and @xmath39 otherwise .",
    "consistent with recent experimental studies @xcite , we assume that each synapse is served by a unique glial cell and that all incoming synapses of one neuron ( i.e. , its dendrites ) are served by one glial cell .",
    "so , given a synapse @xmath38 , there is a unique glial cell @xmath40 such that @xmath41 = @xmath42 .    _",
    "learning _ : let @xmath38 denote the synapse that connects presynaptic neuron @xmath12 to postsynaptic neuron @xmath5 , i.e. , the synapse @xmath38 that corresponds to the neural network edge @xmath43 .",
    "we assume that the absolute strength of synapse @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath44 , depends on its past learning history as determined from the stdp learning rule via an auxiliary variable , @xmath45 , and on the amount of resource @xmath46 at synapse @xmath38 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 evolves according to the stdp learning rule : @xmath51 \\enspace.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , we implement synaptic strength limitation , by requiring @xmath52 not to exceed a maximum value @xmath53 , @xmath54 . for excitatory synapses ( @xmath55 )",
    ", causal firing corresponds to firing of the presynaptic neuron @xmath12 on the previous time step @xmath56 ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) , followed by the firing of the postsynaptic neuron @xmath5 on the current time step @xmath6 ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) .",
    "thus for causal excitations @xmath58 and the excitatory synapse is reinforced .",
    "similarly , for anticausal excitations excitatory synapses are weakened , @xmath59 .",
    "the corresponding analogous conditions hold for inhibitory neurons ( @xmath14 ) .",

    "_ resource - transport dynamics _ : resource diffuses between glia through their connection network ( characterized by the adjacency matrix @xmath31 ) and between glia and the synapses they serve ( via the glial - neural connection network characterized by the adjacency matrix @xmath36 ) .",
    "our model for the evolution of the amount of resource @xmath61 at glial cell @xmath28 and the amount of resource @xmath46 at synapse @xmath38 is @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the rate of diffusion between glial cells , and @xmath65 is the rate of diffusion between glia and synapses .",
    "moreover , we enforce @xmath66 , i.e. , if yields @xmath67 , then we replace it by @xmath68 .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of , @xmath61 , is the amount of resource in glial cell @xmath28 at time @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 denotes the amount of resource added to each glial cell at each time step ( e.g. , supplied by capillary blood vessels ) . for simplicity , we assume each glial cell has the same @xmath69 .",
    "the last two terms are the amount of resource transported to glial cell @xmath28 , respectively , from its neighboring glial cells and from the synapses that it serves .    in",
    ", the first term denotes the amount of resource at synapse @xmath38 at time @xmath6 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath65 denotes the amount of resource gained ( if @xmath70 ) or lost ( if @xmath71 ) from glial cell @xmath40 that serves synapse @xmath38 .",
    "if the presynaptic neuron @xmath72 fires at time step @xmath6 ( @xmath73 ) , then all outgoing synapses for neuron @xmath72 , including @xmath38 , consume some resource , thus decreasing the resource at each synapse by an amount @xmath74 ( where @xmath74 is a model parameter ) .",

    "this gives the mean number of incoming and outgoing synapses per neuron , @xmath80 , and the expected total number of synapses @xmath81 . to specify the initial state of each synapse , at @xmath82 we set @xmath83 and take the initial value of each @xmath84 to be an independent draw from a uniform distribution over @xmath85 $ ]",
    "we then rescale all entries in @xmath76 by a constant to obtain a desired largest eigenvalue of @xmath76 , as discussed below .",
    "the glial network , represented by the matrix @xmath31 having @xmath26 nodes that represent glial cells , is taken to be an undirected and unweighted er network . if the glial cell @xmath33 is connected to the glial cell @xmath28 , then @xmath86 ; and @xmath34 otherwise .",
    "if the probability of forming a link is @xmath87 , then the mean degree of a glial cell is @xmath88 .",
    "recent evidence suggests that the number of glial cells are roughly equal to the number of neurons @xcite , and hence in our experiments we set @xmath89 . the initial resource for each glial cell is taken to be @xmath90 .    in all our experiments",
    "we take the function @xmath52 in to be @xmath91 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "we set @xmath95 and @xmath96 and randomly draw an er directed random graph for the neural network .",
    "we make another draw for the undirected glial network with @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "this gives us @xmath99 .",
    "for all our numerical experiments we take @xmath64 and @xmath65 to be the same , @xmath100 ; we also set the fraction of inhibitory nodes to be @xmath101 @xcite and use the following additional parameter choices @xmath102 we chose these parameter values somewhat arbitrarily but , as shown later , our results are fairly robust to the choice of these values .    in the following ,",
    "we report the three main findings from our model .",
    "first , we show that network dynamics are stable , avoiding saturation or extinction of neural activity .",
    "second , we show that resource transport among the glia is essential to maintain this stability .",
    "third , we verify that the neural network can learn , i.e. , external input results in long - lasting synaptic changes .",
    "_ experiment 1 _ : to quantitatively assess the stability of the network dynamics we study @xmath103 , the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath76 .",
    "previous studies on purely excitatory networks @xcite and networks having inhibitory nodes @xcite show that @xmath103 determines the nature of the network s dynamics : @xmath104 corresponds to a hypoexcitable , or subcritical , state where activity dies out ; @xmath105 corresponds to the stable , critical state where activity is balanced , neither growing nor decaying on average ; and @xmath106 corresponds to a hyperexcitable , supercritical state where the activity grows until nearly all neurons are firing at every time step .",
    "moreover , it has been shown experimentally @xcite that criticality ( @xmath103 near @xmath42 ) provides neural networks with potential benefits for information processing . in this first experiment",
    "we choose different initial conditions for @xmath103 ( obtained by rescaling the initial @xmath76 ) , i.e. , at @xmath82 we start in the critical , subcritical and supercritical states respectively , @xmath107 .",
    "figure  [ fig : stability_exp_lambda ] shows a plot of @xmath103 as a function of time , @xmath6 . in all three cases we find that after a brief transient , the network dynamics become stable , i.e. , @xmath103 fluctuates near 1 after sufficient time has passed .",
    "also , starting at the critical state does not result in any instabilities over time . fig .  [",
    "fig : stability_exp_r ] shows the total resource @xmath108 held in all glia and synapses as a function of time @xmath6 , where @xmath108 is given by @xmath109 in all three cases @xmath108 reaches a steady state value .",
    "[ fig : stability_s ] shows that the average activity , @xmath110 is initially below the activity for the critical case for @xmath111 and above the activity for the critical case for @xmath112 , indicative of the subcritical and supercritical regimes . starting in these regimes , over time ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath113 becomes statistically similar to the dynamics of @xmath113 for the critical initial state of @xmath114 .",
    "thus our model naturally leads to a network that operates in a stable critical ( @xmath103 near @xmath42 ) regime .",
    "this can be understood on the basis that high activity rapidly consumes resources at the synapses , thus reducing their weights , and leading to decrease in @xmath103 ; while with low activity , synapses consume resource at a low rate , allowing buildup of resource with time and consequent increase of synaptic weights , essentially a feedback control stabilization process .",
    "an indication of the potential information handling benefits of criticality @xcite can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : stability_s ] at early time , @xmath115 , where we observe that in both the subcritical ( red triangles ) and supercritical ( blue squares ) states there is relatively little time variation , corresponding to relatively little potential for information content ; while , in contrast , in the critical case ( black circles ) , the signal varies over a larger range ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "_ experiment 2 _ : stdp and resource distribution dynamics are both active during the stabilization demonstrated in figure  [ fig : stability_exp_lambda ] .",
    "next , we pose the question : is the diffusion of resources via the glial network important for stable cortical dynamics ? or can we still get stability if we switch off transport among the glia ( i.e. , set @xmath117 ) ? to do this experiment , for @xmath118 , we let the system reach a steady state with the glial network operative as in fig .  [",

    "we switch off transport among the glia at @xmath123 by setting @xmath117 , and replace by @xmath124 thus the average rate of total nonsynapse resource supply to each glial cell is preserved after the glial diffusion is turned off . replacing by after @xmath125 , we run the dynamics for a total of @xmath126 time steps .    for initial condition @xmath127 , fig .",
    "[ fig : instability_exp ] shows the results for two runs one in which we use the dynamics described by eq .",
    "( 4 ) ( baseline ) and the other in which we switch off the glial network and run the dynamics as described above ( instability ) .",
    "[ fig : instability_exp_r ] shows that after the glial network is switched off , @xmath128 increases as resource starts to accumulate at some synapses and gets used up at others .",
    "such increases and decreases in @xmath129 change the weights of the matrix @xmath76 resulting in an increase in @xmath103 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : instability_exp_lambda ] .",
    "thus the dynamical nature of the diffusion is a crucial process for stabilizing the neural network learning dynamics .",
    "_ experiment 3 _ : in the next experiment we demonstrate that the neural network can learn and memorize while maintaining @xmath103 close to the stable value of @xmath42 . to do this we divide the neurons into two equally sized groups , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , consisting of @xmath132 neurons each .",
    "this results in four groups of synapses : synapses that connect neurons within @xmath130 , synapses from @xmath130 to @xmath131 , synapses from @xmath131 to @xmath130 and synapses that connect neurons within @xmath131 .",
    "we run the dynamics for a total of @xmath126 time steps such that we have three distinct phases : pre - learning ( @xmath133 ) , learning ( @xmath134 ) and post - learning ( @xmath135 ) . in the pre - learning phase ,",
    "the dynamics are as described in the previous section .",
    "the total resource @xmath108 reaches a steady - state value and the eigenvalue @xmath103 fluctuates near @xmath42 ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : learning_lambda ] , [ fig : learning_r ] ) . in the learning phase , for neurons in group @xmath136 ( @xmath137 )",
    "we modify by introducing a time - dependent external stimulus , @xmath138 , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the group to which neuron @xmath5 belongs , and , letting @xmath141 , the learning protocol defining @xmath138 is as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : learning_protocol ] . that is , starting at the beginning of the learning phase ( @xmath142 ) , we stimulate neurons only in @xmath130 ; then , in the next time step , we stimulate neurons only in @xmath131 ; then , in the next two time steps , no stimulus is applied to either group ; and this four step sequence is successively repeated until the end of the learning phase ( @xmath125 ) , past which no stimuli are applied . as expected , sequential firing of @xmath130 neurons followed by @xmath131 neurons results in strengthening of excitatory synapses from @xmath130 to @xmath131 and weakening of excitatory synapses from @xmath131 to @xmath130 .",
    "we plot the mean synaptic strength for the four groups of synapses in figs .",
    "[ fig : learning_excitatory ] .",
    "importantly , these learning - related changes in strengths of the four groups of synapses are preserved in the post - learning phase ( after time step @xmath143 ) , thus confirming that the neural network remembered what it learned .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : learning_r ] shows that during the learning phase there is a corresponding decrease in total resource @xmath108 .",
    "the increased resource consumption and the consequent decrease in @xmath108 can be attributed to the increase in neuronal firing rates owing to the external stimulus . as the stimulus is removed in the post - learning phase , the plots in figs .",
    "[ fig : learning_lambda ] , [ fig : learning_r ] show that the resource @xmath108 is replenished and @xmath103 resets to @xmath42 with fluctuations .",
    "hence , in the post - learning phase we have balanced cortical state , and the neural network remembers what it learned .",
    "thus , although the glial transport stabilizes a unique attracting macrostate with @xmath144 , it , nevertheless , still potentially allows for distinct microstates representing stored information .",
    "_ robustness _",
    ": we find that the qualitative results we obtain in our numerical experiments are fairly robust to parameter variations over a @xmath145% range in @xmath69 and @xmath74 and even larger ranges for @xmath146 and @xmath53 .",
    "one indication of this is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : robustness ] where we plot the time averaged largest eigenvalue @xmath147 of @xmath76 as each parameter @xmath69 , @xmath74 and @xmath146 normalized to their values used in figs .",
    "[ fig : stability_exp]-[fig : learning ] is changed , while keeping the others fixed .",
    "we note that @xmath147 changes only by roughly @xmath148% when @xmath69 or @xmath74 changes by 25% .",
    "a significant amount of the human body s energy consumption occurs at synapses in the brain @xcite .",
    "this energy is consumed by the biophysical mechanisms underlying transsynaptic signaling and in learning - related long - term changes in synapses @xcite .",
    "metabolic resources maintaining this high rate of energy consumption are delivered by a network of glial cells , which transport these resources from the bloodstream to the synapses . since these resources are key to the functioning of synapses , it is natural to ask if the structure and function of this resource transport network plays a role in controlling the activity of the neuronal network in a beneficial way @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have shown , using a two - layered network model comprised of glial cells and neurons , that the dynamics of metabolic resource transport across the network of glial cells can stabilize learning dynamics in neuronal networks .",
    "specifically , our three numerical experiments showed that ( i ) the balance between supply and consumption of resources naturally leads to a regime in which excitation and inhibition are balanced , even if in the initial state they are not , ( ii ) in the absence of diffusion of resources across the glial cell network , the balanced state becomes unstable , and ( iii ) the glial regulated neuronal network can learn and subsequently return to the balanced state retaining the learned pattern .",
    "furthermore , these findings are robust to parameter changes .    it is well known that without homeostatic regulatory mechanisms that control synaptic strengths , hebbian plasticity rules lead to runaway growth in synaptic efficacy and to excessive neural activity @xcite .",
    "various regulatory mechanisms preventing this instability have been proposed theoretically @xcite and found experimentally @xcite .",
    "synaptic scaling @xcite operates on a timescale of hours to days @xcite by reducing all the afferent synapses to a given neuron by the same amount so that relative differences in synaptic strengths are preserved .",
    "mechanisms collectively known as homeostatic intrinsic plasticity modify the intrinsic excitability properties of a neuron depending on its firing activity @xcite by up- or down - regulating the expression of membrane ion channels .",
    "another class of models considers plasticity rules whose parameters depend on neuronal activity ( metaplasticity ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , stand - alone stdp models that result in stable critical dynamics have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the belief has been expressed that these diverse mechanisms operate together , complementing each other , to keep neural dynamics in a balanced regime ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it has been pointed out recently that , consistent with our experiment 3 , a homeostatic mechanism that operates on faster timescales might also be necessary @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we hypothesize that the regulatory mechanism imposed by metabolic resource distribution via the glial network could play this role . for related work on the influence of the glial network on neurons",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",
    "we note that regulation of network activity by depletion of metabolic resources was proposed recently by delattre et al .",
    "@xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite considers a modification of the stdp rule that depends on a global metabolic resource that is depleted by the globally averaged network activity , and finds that it results in stable neural activity .",
    "in contrast to globally - based resource regulation , we consider here a spatially distributed resource transportation network in which resource diffusion through the glial cell network plays the key role in stabilizing the neural dynamics at the balanced state ( @xmath103 near @xmath42 in our model ) . in the limit of infinitely fast diffusion ,",
    "the resource at every glial cell would become the same , and our model would reduce to one similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite . however , local resource depletion and transport through the network of glia is more realistic and allows one to study the effect of different forms of spatially structured neuron - glia interactions .",
    "finally we note that while in this paper we used simple models for the neuronal network , the glial network , and the resource dynamics , our work can be extended to include more realistic modeling .    in the broader context of network science",
