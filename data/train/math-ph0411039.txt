    "( @xmath8do ) operator @xcite , that is , its action on the wavefield @xmath4 amounts to the fourier integral operator @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a matrix of smooth functions , referred to as _ symbols _ , that depend on the wavevector @xmath11 as well as on the outcoming ( @xmath12 ) and incoming ( @xmath13 ) variables .",
    "moreover , symbols are characterized by the estimate @xcite @xmath14 for @xmath15 ( _ semiclassical limit _ ) , where the scalelength @xmath16 characterizes the nonuniformity of the operator , being defined by @xmath17 ; in equation ( [ 3 ] ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are multi - indices of dimension @xmath6 and @xmath20 , respectively , with , e.g. , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , whereas @xmath23 is a real number specifying the order of both the symbol and the corresponding operator .",
    "the condition ( [ 3 ] ) is automatically satisfied if @xmath24 is a polynomial in @xmath25 with smooth @xmath12-dependent ( matrix - valued ) coefficients , namely , @xmath26 with @xmath23 a positive integer , the corresponding @xmath8do amounting to the partial differential operator ( pdo ) @xmath27 .",
    "it is worth noting that in this case the response @xmath28 of the operator depends on the derivatives of the wavefield of order @xmath29 only , i.e. , @xmath1 is a _ local operator _ ; in order to account for _ nonlocal effects _ in the response , polynomials ( of _ integer _ order @xmath23 ) have been generalized to symbols ( of _ real _ order @xmath23 ) .    as a consequence of the estimate ( [ 3 ] ) , symbols can be exploited in order to deal with the corresponding operators ( _ symbol calculus _ ) . with this aim",
    "it is convenient to perform , in equation ( [ 2 ] ) , the coordinate transformation @xmath30 with @xmath31 , redefine the symbol according to @xmath32 and expand with respect to @xmath33 . as a result one",
    "gets the sequence of symbols @xmath34 of decreasing order ( @xmath35 , cf . , equation ( [ 3 ] ) ) for @xmath36 , which can be _ resummed _",

    "is referred to as the _ reduced symbol _ of the operator since it depends on a single @xmath12-variable rather than on both @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the semiclassical limit @xmath42 , the series ( [ 5 ] )",
    "is asymptotically convergent and for practical applications only the first two terms are significant .",
    "the advantage of the reduced symbol is that one can replace @xmath1 by any @xmath8do @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath44 , which depends on @xmath45 through the convex combination @xmath46 only .",
    "more specifically , the remainder @xmath47 is a @xmath8do of order @xmath48 , i.e. , the corresponding symbol @xmath49 satisfies the estimate ( [ 3 ] ) for any order @xmath23 , thus @xmath50 can be neglected in the semiclassical limit @xmath51 , being formally of order @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , two specific forms of the reduced symbol play a key role in physical applications :    * the _ left_-reduced symbol @xmath53 , * the _ weyl _ symbol @xmath54 ;    the former is the simplest generalization of the symbol of a partial differential operator ( cf . , section 2 ) , whereas the latter properly accounts for the nonuniformity of the medium @xcite ( cf . ,",

    "in plasma physics pseudodifferential operators are found on dealing with linear wave propagation as a consequence of the dispersion combined with space- and time - variations of the background plasma .    as an example of how symbol calculus can be applied ,",
    "let us consider a cold isotropic plasma for which the constitutive relationship for electromagnetic waves is given in implicit form by the generalized ohm s law which relates the induced current density @xmath70 to the wave electric field @xmath71 , namely , @xmath72 @xmath73 being the squared electron plasma frequency which depends on both the point - location @xmath74 and time @xmath75 through the electron density profile .",
    "equation ( [ 3.1 ] ) can be cast in the form @xmath76 with @xmath77 the first order partial differential operator with total symbol @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a zero order symbol playing the role of a fictitious collisional frequency . in the high frequency limit ,",
    "the properties of the operator @xmath77 are dominated by the symbol @xmath80 which , however , is not unique being defined apart from the arbitrary function @xmath81 ( for sake of completeness let us mention that , for symbols that can be written as a sum of homogeneous functions , the order of homogeneity allows to distinguish uniquely the leading term @xcite ; here , however , such a property is ignored as it does not hold in the general case ) .",
    "let us search for a @xmath8do @xmath82 such that @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the identity operator ( with symbol @xmath85 ) and @xmath86 a remainder of order @xmath87 .",
    "a solution @xmath82 of equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) is an approximate inverse ( _ parametrix _ ) of @xmath77 , thus , one gets @xmath88 where the remainder @xmath89 can be neglected in the semiclassical limit with the result that @xmath90 .    the needed solution of equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) is obtained on exploiting the product - rule ( [ 8a ] ) for left - reduced symbols which yields @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 , @xmath94 being the left symbol of the parametrix @xmath82 .",

    "the induced current is related to the electric displacement by @xmath98 which can be solved for @xmath99 on noting that the parametrix of @xmath100 corresponds to the symbol @xmath101 and applying again the product - rule ( [ 8a ] ) with the result that @xmath102 , the dielectric operator @xmath103 being a @xmath8do of order zero with symbol ( cf . , equations ( [ 3.4 ] ) )",

    "finally , the resulting wave equation for the electric field reads @xmath109 which follows directly from maxwell s equations ( with no external drive ) .",
    "the foregoing calculation of the response of a non - magnetized plasma exemplifies a general procedure that can be applied to more general cases ( including , e.g. , the effects of the magnetic field ) and proves that the wave equation for electromagnetic waves in plasmas is , in general , a pseudodifferential equation .",
    "a general solution of the inhomogeneous wave equation ( [ 1 ] ) amounts to the sum of a solution of the corresponding homogeneous problem , @xmath110 , plus a particular solution of the whole inhomogeneous equation .    * the geometrical optics solution .",

    "as far as mode conversion can be neglected @xcite , the polarization vector amounts to    [ 11 ] @xmath126 with @xmath127 being an eigenvector of the dispersion tensor , corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath128 .",

    "it should be noted that the form ( [ 11 ] ) of the go equations holds independently on whether one makes use of the exact symbol @xmath10 or any of its reduced forms @xmath44 ; in the latter case the dispersion tensor amounts to @xmath135 , whereas the absorption coeffcient reads @xmath136 $ ] which , in particular , takes the simplest form if the weyl symbol is used , namely , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     let us note that several features of the bt solution ( [ 13 ] ) are general . in particular , the wavefield can be written in form of a _ complex_-eikonal wavelet [ 6 - 8 ] @xmath197 where both the complex amplitude @xmath198 and the _ complex_-eikonal function @xmath199 have been expanded in taylor series with respect to @xmath200 in a neighbourhood of the space - time curve @xmath179 , with time @xmath75 labelling the position along the curve and @xmath200 being its distance from the considered point @xmath177 ( _ paraxial expansion _ ) , namely , @xmath201^{\\frac{1}{2 } } e^{-i\\varphi(t)},\\\\ & \\bar{s}(x , t ) = s_{0}(t ) + k_{0}(x - v_{g}t ) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{k_{0}}{r(t ) } + \\frac{2i}{w^{2}(t ) } \\right ] ( x - v_{g}t)^{2 } + o(\\delta^{\\frac{1}{2}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which holds within the paraxial approximation with @xmath202 . as a consequence , the whole wavefield around the reference curve ( which in the general case amounts to a go ray referred to as the _ reference ray",
