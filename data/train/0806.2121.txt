    "low momentum jets are estimated to produce 50% of transverse energy in rhic heavy ion collisions and 80% at the lhc @xcite . despite the large role these _ minijets _ play ,",
    "they have received little attention from the general community since the start of the rhic experimental program . as minijet abundance increases at higher energies",
    ", the dynamics of minijet interactions are becoming essential to understanding heavy ion collisions .",
    "while low momentum jets are not individually resolvable , their combined effect generates an observable correlation . in a theoretical context minijets",
    "are typically defined within the range of applicability of pqcd by specifying a low hadron @xmath6 cutoff around 2 gev / c , even though qcd interactions continue to lower @xmath6 .",
    "we experimentally define minijets based on correlation structure rather than an _ a priori _ @xmath6 range .",
    "this requires a _ minimum - bias _ two - particle correlation analysis where every possible pair of particles is considered instead of selecting a few trigger / associated pairs .",
    "minijets are distinguished from other sources by decomposing the unique correlations .",
    "previous analyses have used this technique to reveal large minijet contributions in transverse @xcite and axial ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) @xcite spaces at 130 gev at four centralities . here",
    "we report the detailed energy and centrality dependence of minijet angular correlations at rhic .",
    "charged particle tracks detected in the star tpc with @xmath7 gev / c , @xmath8 , and full @xmath9 azimuth were analyzed from 1.2 m minbias triggered 200 gev au+au and 6.7 m 62 gev au+au events .",
    "pair densities @xmath10 were measured as number of pairs per unit area on relative angles ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) for all possible unique particle pairs .",
    "particles within the same event form _ sibling _ pair densities @xmath13 , while mixing particles from different events measures the uncorrelated _ reference _ @xmath14 .",
    "these are formed into a normalized covariance to produce a correlation measure .",
    "the difference @xmath15 measures the covariance in number of pairs between histogram bins , and the normalization is provided by bin - wise division of @xmath16 .",
    "thus we use the notation @xmath17 for a _ per - particle _ correlation measure , shown in figure [ fig1 ] for selected centralities .",
    "proton - proton collisions provide a reference for measuring the contributions to these structures .",
    "analysis of minimum - bias correlations @xcite and single particle @xmath6 spectra @xcite show that p+p collisions are well described by a two - component soft and semi - hard scattering model , as commonly used in event generators such as pythia .",
    "the soft component represents longitudinal fragmentation in unlike - sign pairs and produces a 1d gaussian correlation centered along @xmath18=0 .",
    "the semi - hard component contains a same - side peak , modeled as a 2d gaussian at the @xmath19 origin , and an away - side ridge centered at @xmath20=@xmath21 . for an inclusive @xmath6 range the away - side",
    "is completely represented by function @xmath22 that approximates a wide gaussian which narrows with increasing @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the final component necessary to describe p+p data is a 2d exponential at the origin containing contributions from hbt in like - sign pairs and conversion @xmath23 in unlike - sign pairs .",
    "to ensure the simplest possible fit function for au+au collisions , we use these components from p+p collisions with only one additional @xmath24 quadrupole term to account for correlations conventionally attributed to elliptic flow @xcite . the eleven parameter fit function used for the correlation structures in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "is then : + [ eq : fit ] f = a _ _ ( _ ) + a_2_(2 _ ) + g_s(@xmath18 : a_0 , _ 0 ) + g_h(@xmath18 , @xmath20 : a_1 , _ , _ ) + + e(@xmath18 , @xmath20 : a_2 , w _ , w _ ) + a_3 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the soft and hard gaussian terms and @xmath27 is an exponential function with parameters listed after the colon .",
    "an example of this fit is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the measured fit parameters for the same - side peak amplitude , @xmath18 width , and volume ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "fitting errors are shown and systematic error is estimated to be @xmath299% of the correlation amplitude and at most a few percent of the widths .",
    "the dashed lines show the binary scaling reference expected from independent nucleon - nucleon collisions . using the kharzeev and nardi two - component model @xcite and path length @xmath30 , the minijet amplitude in au+au collisions",
    "is expected to scale as @xmath31 $ ] from the p+p value .",
    "peripheral collisions follow the binary scaling reference closely , deviating only by small increases in @xmath18 and decreases in @xmath20 widths .",
    "the data show a sharp transition at approximately 55% centrality for 200 gev and 40% for 62 gev where the amplitude and @xmath18 widths increase dramatically while the @xmath20 widths continue to decrease slightly .",
    "centrality in figure [ fig3 ] is represented by transverse particle density calculated as @xmath32 with initial collision overlap area @xmath33 from monte carlo glauber .",
    "transverse density brings the transition points for the two energies to coincidence , whereas conventional centrality measures displace the transition points and tend to compress the peripheral data",
    ".     width , and volume fits . points",
    "show eleven centrality bins for each energy ( 84 - 93% , 74 - 84% , 65 - 74% , 55 - 65% , 46 - 55% , 37 - 46% , 28 - 37% , 19 - 28% , 9 - 19% , 5 - 9% , and 0 - 5% ) transformed to tranvserse density . ]",
    "the correlation structures are modified at the transition , but are still likely to be associated with minijets for several reasons .",
    "first , these results , particularly when taken with a similar analysis of @xmath6 correlations @xcite , show that contributions from a new physical mechanism unrelated to minijets are unlikely .",
    "any such hypothetical process must have @xmath20 widths and @xmath6 correlations that match seamlessly with minijets , which would be a remarkable coincidence .",
    "second , the amplitude and @xmath18 width increases are consistent with further minijet interactions , which may be possible due to path - length considerations @xcite . finally , it is possible that the new correlation structures are due to changes in minijet fragmentation .",
    "the trends in the data also suggest a lower @xmath6 manifestation of the `` ridge '' @xcite , and these results may help to discriminate among the many competing models of ridge formation .",
    "the same - side peak volume gives the total number of correlated pairs , though finding the particle yield requires estimating the average number of correlated structures per event .",
    "assuming each structure originates with a semi - hard parton and that semi - hard scattering follows binary scaling , we estimate that 30% of all final - state hadrons in central 200 gev au+au collisions are associated with this same - side correlation .    as a source of correlated low momentum particles",
    ", minijets provide an extremely sensitive probe of the collision system .",
    "the binary scaling reference represents one extreme limit of a transparent medium , while the other extreme is a completely thermalized system opaque to minijets @xcite .",
    "these results call into question the existence of the latter system at rhic energies .",
