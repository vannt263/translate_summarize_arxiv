    "instabilities due to magnetic buoyancy are driven by stratified horizontal magnetic fields in compressible plasmas @xcite , and may thus occur in a range of astrophysical settings  for example , in stars , in accretion disks and in the interstellar medium ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "of particular recent interest is the idea that such instabilities are responsible for the break - up and escape of predominantly toroidal magnetic field from the solar tachocline ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , producing the stitches of field that eventually appear at the surface as active regions .",
    "one of the earliest studies of magnetic buoyancy instability was by @xcite , who considered the linear instability of a magnetohydrostatic atmosphere with a vertically stratified , horizontal magnetic field .",
    "motivated by the extreme parameter values that pertain astrophysically , gilman considered the case of an inviscid , perfectly conducting gas in which the thermal relaxation is sufficiently rapid that the temperature can be specified for all times .",
    "he anticipated that , under these assumptions , the fastest growing perturbations would be infinitesimally narrow in the horizontal direction perpendicular to the imposed horizontal magnetic field .",
    "interestingly , this approach leads to a ` dispersion relation ' relating the ( possibly complex ) frequency to the horizontal wavenumber , but one in which the coefficients are dependent on the vertical coordinate @xmath1 .",
    "thus one may formally associate a different dispersion relation with each height .",
    "mathematically , however , the problem can be posed as a two - point boundary value problem with well - defined ( constant ) eigenvalues .",
    "the aim of this paper is to clarify the connection between these two ostensibly rather different approaches .    the analysis , although new to this problem and , as far as we are aware , to the study of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities , may be regarded as essentially a rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation analysis exploiting the large transverse horizontal wavenumber . in geophysical fluid dynamics , inertial instabilities of a rotating , stratified flow with arbitrary horizontal cross - stream shear",
    "have been analyzed using this technique by @xcite , who considered perturbations that are highly localized in the horizontal cross - stream direction .",
    "the alternative to this boundary layer ( or internal layer ) type approach is a wkb analysis , as used in magnetohydrodynamics by @xcite and @xcite , who considered highly localized ( in radius ) magnetic instabilities in accretion disks .",
    "each method has its strengths : on the one hand , wkb analysis is more general ; on the other , the boundary layer approach is mathematically simpler and more physically appealing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the governing equations describing the magnetic buoyancy instability of a layer of gas with a vertically stratified horizontal magnetic field are set out in section  [ sec : math_form ] , together with the formulation of the problem both as a two - point boundary value problem and as one yielding a ` depth - dependent dispersion relation ' with growth rate @xmath2 . for simplicity",
    "we first restrict attention to two - dimensional ( interchange ) perturbations , for which the magnetic field remains unidirectional . in section  [ sec : example ] , in order to elucidate the key aspects of the analysis , we revisit the problem of the quantum harmonic oscillator , which shares an important common feature with the problem of magnetic buoyancy instability at high wavenumber . in section  [ sec : mbe ] , we apply a high wavenumber asymptotic analysis to the governing mhd equation , considering in detail two distinct cases , depending on whether @xmath2 is maximized strictly within the layer of gas ( where @xmath3 is locally quadratic in @xmath1 ) or whether the maximum occurs at the boundary ( with @xmath3 locally linear in @xmath1 ) . as a result of this analysis",
    "we are able to reconcile the idea of a depth - dependent dispersion relation with the solutions of the two - point boundary eigenvalue problem . in section  [ sec : te ] we consider the instability from the different standpoint of an initial value problem , calculating how an initial perturbation evolves with time , and demonstrating the relation of this solution to those derived in section  [ sec : mbe ] . in section  [ sec:3d ]",
    "we show how the high wavenumber analysis carries over to the case of fully three - dimensional perturbations .",
    "the concluding discussion is contained in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "following @xcite , we consider magnetic buoyancy instabilities under the assumptions that the gas is isothermal , inviscid and electrically perfectly conducting .",
    "the main argument of the paper can be advanced even when the system is rather simple , so here we choose to ignore the effects of rotation . by adopting the layer depth @xmath4 , the free fall time @xmath5 and the free fall velocity @xmath6 as units of length , time and velocity respectively ( where @xmath7 is the acceleration of gravity , assumed constant ) , the equations of motion , induction and mass conservation , together with the perfect gas law , take the following dimensionless form : @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the constant temperature of the system , @xmath15 is the gas constant , @xmath16 is the permeability of free space , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are representative values of the pressure , density and magnetic field respectively .",
    "the plasma @xmath20 , here defined by @xmath21 represents the ratio of the gas pressure to twice the magnetic pressure .",
    "additionally , we define the non - dimensional isothermal speed of sound @xmath22 , the non - dimensional alfvn speed @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the following relations then hold between the various parameters : @xmath25 we now consider a stationary equilibrium layer of gas in the ( dimensionless ) region @xmath26 with a horizontal , depth - dependent magnetic field , @xmath27 the pressure and density of the static basic state are determined by the two coupled equations @xmath28 @xmath29 from which the density distribution is given by , @xmath30    in order to retain as much simplicity as possible , we shall first assume that the perturbations to the basic state are two - dimensional , varying in the directions perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field ( _ interchange modes _ ) ( three - dimensional perturbations are considered in section  [ sec:3d ] ) .",
    "thus we adopt perturbations of the following form :    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    introducing these into equations  ( [ eq : ns ] )  ( [ eq : eqstate ] ) ( equation  ( [ eq : divb ] ) is trivially satisfied ) , with the basic state given by expressions  ( [ eq : bs_field ] ) , ( [ eq : isotherm_bs_eq_2 ] ) and ( [ eq : bs_rho ] ) , and then linearizing , leads to the following set of equations : @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 equations  ( [ eq : pert_v ] )  ( [ eq : pert_p ] ) can be manipulated to give the following second - order ordinary differential equation for the vertical velocity @xmath39 : @xmath40 where the ( @xmath1-dependent ) inverse scale heights for density and magnetic field are given by @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and where @xmath43 .",
    "thus the mhd stability problem reduces to a two - point boundary problem , with boundary conditions on the vertical velocity at the horizontal boundaries ; the simplest choice is to impose impermeability , namely @xmath44 at @xmath45 . the growth rate @xmath3 is determined as an eigenvalue of the problem . for a general @xmath1-dependent basic state , equation  ( [ eq : bvp ] )",
    "requires a numerical solution .",
    "gilman s ( 1970 ) analysis proceeded by considering the limit as @xmath46 in the governing equations ( here ( [ eq : pert_v ] )  ( [ eq : pert_p ] ) ) , but with no explicit assumption about the locality in @xmath1 of the perturbations .",
    "this leads , from ( [ eq : pert_v ] ) , to the vanishing of the total pressure perturbation , thus giving a direct relation between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , from equation  ( [ eq : pert_w ] ) , the vanishing of the total pressure perturbation leads to a relation between @xmath39 and @xmath49 .",
    "thus , using also equation  ( [ eq : pert_p ] ) , @xmath47 , @xmath49 and @xmath48 can all be expressed in terms of @xmath39 .",
    "on eliminating the finite product @xmath50 between equations  ( [ eq : pert_b ] ) and ( [ eq : pert_rho ] ) , the terms in @xmath51 disappear .",
    "substitution for @xmath47 , @xmath49 and @xmath48 in terms of @xmath39 then leads to the following expression : @xmath52 w = 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : gilman}\\ ] ] this is a simplified version of expression  ( 14 ) in @xcite , excluding the effects of rotation and three - dimensional perturbations . expression  ( [ eq : gilman ] ) may be regarded as a depth - dependent dispersion relation , in that it implies that the instability growth rate @xmath3 ( a constant ) takes a different value at each height @xmath1 . with this interpretation",
    ", it leads to the following criterion for instability ( @xmath53 ) : @xmath54 this is consistent with the result of @xcite , obtained under the assumption that perturbations are localized in both the horizontal _ and _ vertical directions ; in the derivation of expression  ( [ eq : gilman ] ) , however , there is no explicit assumption of locality in @xmath1 .",
    "expression  ( [ eq : gilman ] ) is clearly consistent with formally letting @xmath46 in  ( [ eq : bvp ] ) ; our aim in this paper is to relate the solutions of the full governing ordinary differential equation  ( [ eq : bvp ] ) to expressions  ( [ eq : gilman ] ) and ( [ eq : inst_criterion ] ) . for later work",
    "it will be helpful formally to define the function @xmath2 by @xmath55 we shall retain the symbol @xmath3 to denote the true eigenvalues .",
    "in this section we introduce a simplified example problem designed to mimic some of the key properties of the perturbation equations for the magnetic buoyancy instability in the short wavelength limit .",
    "we consider a linear pde , first - order in time and second - order in space ( @xmath1 ) , containing a parameter @xmath0 to represent the wavenumber of the system . with the introduction of a growth rate @xmath3",
    "this becomes a second - order ode analogous to ( [ eq : bvp ] ) . just as for the full ode  ( [ eq : bvp ] ) , our example reduces to a purely algebraic equation determining @xmath3 as a function of @xmath1 in the formal limit of @xmath56 ( and where the gradient terms are small in comparison with this limit ) .",
    "the example highlights the meaning of the growth rate in such a limit .",
    "we consider the following pde for the function @xmath57 on the spatial domain @xmath26 : @xmath58 f + \\frac{1}{k^2 } \\frac{\\partial ^2 f}{\\partial z^2 } .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : expde ] ) contains the parameters @xmath60 , which we shall assume to be positive , and @xmath61 , which we assume satisfies @xmath62 .    on expressing the time dependence of the function @xmath63 as @xmath64 ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : expde ] ) becomes the second - order ode @xmath65 f = 0 , \\label{eq : exode}\\ ] ] with boundary conditions @xmath66 .",
    "as @xmath0 is increased , the derivative term in equation  ( [ eq : exode ] ) becomes increasingly unimportant , except in the regions where the coefficient of @xmath63 could be comparable with the second derivative . in the large @xmath0 limit",
    "described earlier , equation  ( [ eq : exode ] ) reduces to @xmath67 an equation for the growth rate as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "this quadratic function is clearly maximized at @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "we might therefore expect to see the fastest growing solutions of equation  ( [ eq : exode ] ) become increasingly localized about @xmath68 as @xmath0 is increased . for the particular equation  ( [ eq : exode ] )",
    "this idea can be put on a rigorous footing .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : exode ] ) can be recast in the standard form of the parabolic cylinder equation @xmath70 by writing @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the boundary conditions are now @xmath73 at both @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    to determine the permissible values of @xmath76 we note that @xmath77 in the large @xmath0 limit , provided that @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the problem is then the familiar one of a quantum harmonic oscillator for the wave function @xmath80 with @xmath81 as @xmath82 .",
    "the most general solution to equation  ( [ eq : expc ] ) ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be expressed in terms of parabolic cylinder functions @xmath83 as @xmath84 where @xmath85 . for @xmath86 , the asymptotic form of @xmath87 as @xmath88",
    "is given by @xmath89 thus @xmath90 grows exponentially as @xmath91 for all @xmath92 ; hence to satisfy @xmath93 as @xmath91 it follows that @xmath94 . since @xmath95 as @xmath91 , the most general solution of equation  ( [ eq : qho ] ) satisfying @xmath93 as @xmath91 is @xmath96 .",
    "now for @xmath97 , the asymptotic form of @xmath87 as @xmath88 becomes @xmath98 hence @xmath99 grows exponentially as @xmath100 unless @xmath101 is infinite ; this occurs only if @xmath92 is a non - negative integer .",
    "therefore the only allowable values of @xmath76 are @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 . when @xmath105 @xmath106 , @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the @xmath109th - degree hermite polynomial .",

    "thus there is a solution for each @xmath115 , with @xmath116 turning points .",
    "as @xmath0 is increased , the spacing between the turning points decreases and the functions become increasingly localized about @xmath68 .",
    "this is illustrated by figure  [ fig : f_eigenmode ] , which shows the eigenfunctions for @xmath117 and @xmath118 for increasing values of @xmath0 .",
    "+     +    the eigenvalue analysis above can now be related to the original evolution pde ( [ eq : expde ] ) .",
    "appealing to the completeness of the eigenfunctions of the linear operator , the solution @xmath57 can be expressed as a sum of exponentially growing eigenfunctions ( [ eq : dn ] ) .",
    "thus , from an arbitrary initial condition @xmath119 , the long term solution will have the spatial form @xmath120 , corresponding to the maximum growth rate of @xmath121 .",
    "the eigenfunction is peaked at @xmath122 , i.e.  at @xmath123 .",
    "this is illustrated by figure  [ fig : f_ivp ] , which shows the temporal evolution of the spatial dependence of @xmath57 starting from two initial conditions .",
    "armed with the findings of section  [ sec : example ] , we are now in a position to analyze the eigenvalue problem  ( [ eq : bvp ] ) determining the magnetic buoyancy instability . clearly , just as for equation  ( [ eq : exode ] ) , the @xmath46 limit is singular , with the coefficient of the highest ( second ) derivative ( i.e.   @xmath124 ) tending to zero .",
    "this suggests that the eigenmodes become localized when @xmath0 becomes large and thus we may use singular perturbation techniques ( boundary layer techniques ) to solve the eigenvalue problem . for a certain eigenmode and eigenvalue",
    "@xmath3 the main flow equation in the region where the derivatives are of order unity ( i.e.  outside any boundary / internal layer ) is given , as in @xcite , by expression  ( [ eq : gilman ] ) , i.e.@xmath125 since @xmath3 is a constant , whereas @xmath126 is a function of @xmath1 , the only way to satisfy equation ( [ eq : lklimitgrate ] ) is for @xmath39 to be zero in the main flow , i.e.  in the region where the @xmath1-derivatives of @xmath39 are negligible .",
    "thus for @xmath127 , we seek a mode associated with a specific eigenvalue @xmath3 that is localized in the vicinity of @xmath128 , defined as the value of @xmath1 where @xmath129 .",
    "( another possibility is for the second derivative of @xmath39 to be large not only locally , but in a significant part of the fluid domain , i.e.  that the solutions are strongly oscillatory ; see section  [ subsec : no_max ] . )",
    "hence we define a scaled length variable by @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a measure of the thickness of the boundary / internal layer .",
    "it follows from introducing the new boundary layer variable into equation ( [ eq : bvp ] ) and expanding all functions of @xmath132 and the growth rate @xmath133 in powers of @xmath134 , that the only distinguished limits possible require @xmath135 , with a balance between the second derivative and the terms proportional to @xmath39 of the form    [ eq : possible_balances ] @xmath136w = \\frac{\\sigma_0 ^ 2 } { \\delta^2 k^2 }   \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}^2 w}{{\\mathrm{d}}\\xi^2 } , \\label{eq : possible_balances_1}\\ ] ] @xmath137w = \\frac{\\sigma_0 ^ 2}{\\delta^3 k^2 } \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}^2 w}{{\\mathrm{d}}\\xi^2 } , \\label{eq : possible_balances_2}\\ ] ] @xmath138w \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath139    where all the functions of @xmath1 are evaluated at @xmath128 .",

    "importantly , in the analysis that follows , we assume that the basic state is such that @xmath157 , i.e.  the system is unstable .    at this stage",
    "it is important to distinguish between various cases requiring different treatments ; we consider these in turn below . in section  [ subsec : max_in_interior ]",

    "if we consider the evolution of the instability in terms of an initial value problem then , ultimately , the mode of maximum growth rate will prevail .",
    "that said , other modes may be significant at earlier times , depending on the initial perturbation . thus in section  [ subsec : no_max ] and the appendix we explore the large @xmath0 asymptotic solutions about a general point in the layer where the growth rate is not maximized .      here",

    "through the use of a rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation analysis to exploit the large wavenumber in the horizontal transverse direction , we have revisited the problem introduced in the pioneering works of @xcite and @xcite of the magnetic buoyancy instability in a plane layer of fluid permeated by an external horizontal magnetic field decreasing with height .",

    ", the eigenfunction is localized close to the boundary and takes the form of an airy function .",
    "the modes associated with growth rates that are less than maximal exhibit strong oscillations ; these can be captured only via a wkb approach , as presented in the appendix .",
    "we have confirmed the results of the asymptotic analysis by numerical simulations of the time evolution of the perturbations , posed as an initial value problem .",
    "these clearly show that , starting from an initial condition composed of a set of eigenmodes , the mode that eventually dominates the evolution , in the large @xmath0 limit , is that with growth rate corresponding to the maximum of the growth rate function @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , this mode is localized in the vicinity of @xmath61 , the height in the layer at which @xmath2 is maximized .",
    "the asymptotic analysis carries over , albeit with more algebraic complications , to the case of three - dimensional perturbations that are infinitesimally thin in the horizontal direction perpendicular to the imposed field , but have a finite ( though long ) wavelength along the field . from an analysis of the dispersion relation  ( [ eq:3d_dispersion ] ) , we have shown how 3d perturbations are the only unstable modes for weakly unstable magnetic field gradients , but that for sufficiently strong field gradients , interchange modes have the largest growth rate .",
    "it is of interest to consider what the analysis tells us about the specific physics of the magnetic buoyancy instability and , more generally , to enquire into the wider class of instabilities that can be so analyzed .",
    "magnetic buoyancy instabilities are driven by a destabilizing magnetic field gradient and inhibited by a stabilizing entropy gradient .",
    "the latter is eroded by a combination of high thermal diffusivity and small wavelengths transverse to the imposed field ; in the limiting case we have considered here , the thermal diffusion tends to infinity and the wavelength to zero .",
    "the crucial feature revealed by the analysis of section  [ sec : mbe ] is that the assumption of locality in the horizontal direction implies locality in the vertical . for a case",
    "when the growth rate function @xmath2 is positive in only a small section of the layer , it is perhaps not surprising that the eigenfunction of the fastest growing mode is peaked in that region ; the important feature revealed here is that the fastest growing eigenfunction is always peaked where @xmath2 is maximized , even when @xmath2 is positive throughout the layer .    in a wider context , is it possible to identify , simply from general considerations , other instabilities that can be analyzed within the same framework ? certainly two necessary conditions can be identified : one is a physical reason for an instability to have a small wavelength in one specific direction ; the other is an inhomogeneity of the basic state in an orthogonal direction . for magnetic buoyancy instability",
    "as discussed here , the small wavelength in the @xmath339-direction arises from the erosion of the stabilizing gradient through thermal diffusion , whereas the inhomogeneity in the vertical direction is a consequence of the @xmath1-dependence of the basic state magnetic field and thermodynamic variables . in a boussinesq atmosphere ,",
    "in which stratification is uniform with depth , we would therefore not expect any localization in the vertical  this is consistent with the magneto - boussinesq analysis of @xcite .",
    "for the very different problem of the instability of a rotating , stratified flow with arbitrary horizontal cross - stream shear , considered by @xcite , the assumed small scale is in the vertical , resulting from the stable stratification , with the inhomogeneity resulting from the shear flow .    in the present analysis",
    "we have neglected viscosity and magnetic diffusivity and assumed infinitely fast thermal diffusion .",
    "the effects of finite diffusion will of course influence the dynamics at sufficiently large @xmath0 , and will act to establish a finite magnitude of the wave vector for unstable modes . thermal diffusion will , however , still greatly dominate and thus , although consideration of the full dynamics will lead to modification of the quantitative results , we expect that the short - wavelength nature in the horizontal direction perpendicular to the field and the strong localization in the vertical direction of the most unstable perturbations to persist .",
    "we are grateful to douglas gough , stephen griffiths , chris jones , michael proctor and steve tobias for valuable discussions .",
    "this work was funded by the stfc rolling grant held at the university of leeds .",
    "for completeness , here we consider the structure of the solutions in the case where the growth rate @xmath3 is not maximal in @xmath26 .",
    "as explained in section  [ subsec : no_max ] , the boundary layer analysis of sections  [ subsec : max_in_interior ] and [ subsec : max_at_bdry ] is not suitable in this case , and it is thus necessary to adopt a more general , but more complicated , wkb approach ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "we will only consider the first two terms of the expansion ( [ eq : wkb_expansion ] ) , i.e.  the ` physical optics ' approximation ; this constitutes an asymptotic approximation to the solution of ( [ eq : bvp ] ) since the subsequent terms are small provided the functions @xmath343 are bounded . introducing the expansion ( [ eq : wkb_expansion ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : bvp ] ) yields @xmath344 .",
