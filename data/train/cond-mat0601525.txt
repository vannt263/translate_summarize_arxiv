    "in the presence of spin - orbit coupling spin currents and spin polarization can be generated as a response to electric fields [ ] .",
    "recently the spin - hall effect , i.e. a spin current that flows perpendicular to an applied electric field has been observed experimentally in electron doped semiconductors and in a two - dimensional hole system [ ] .",
    "theoretically one may distinguish the extrinsic from the intrinsic spin - hall effect , depending on whether spin - orbit coupling arises due to scattering by impurities or from the intrinsic band structure of the samples .",
    "the intrinsic spin - hall effect has first been studied for holes in p - type semiconductors in [ ] and for electrons in n - type semiconductors in [ ] . in both cases , the striking result is the independence of the spin - hall conductivity @xmath1 of the strength of the spin - orbit coupling , at least when disorder effects are ignored .",
    "sinova et al .",
    "[ ] found in the two - dimensional electron system with rashba spin - orbit coupling a universal value for the spin - hall conductivity , @xmath2 .",
    "soon it was realized that the universal spin - hall conductivity still exists in the presence of a dresselhaus term [ ] , and even in the presence of a weak in - plane magnetic field [ ] .",
    "it was pointed out that this may be related to a berry phase in momentum space , i.e.  the winding number of the spin - orbit field when going once around the fermi surface .",
    "shytov et al .",
    "[ ] showed such a connection explicitly in the specific case where the modulus of the spin - orbit field remains constant on the fermi surface .",
    "clearly it is an important question to ask how @xmath1 depends on disorder . for the rashba model",
    "the effect is quite dramatic , namely an arbitrarily weak amount of disorder fully suppresses the spin - hall conductivity [ ] .",
    "meanwhile it is understood that this surprising result is a special property of the rashba hamiltonian and is related to the linear - in - momentum spin - orbit field : the time derivative of the total spin is proportional to the spin current , so that in a steady state both quantities are zero [ ] . in the case of a more general spin - orbit field , a finite spin - hall effect has been reported even in the presence of disorder [ ] .    with the conventional definition of the spin current , given by the anticommutator of the velocity operator and the pauli matrices , the spin current is not conserved . hence it is not automatically guaranteed that a current in the bulk induces a polarization at the edges of the sample . furthermore the spin current is not directly accessible experimentally ; the measurable quantity is the spin polarization instead .",
    "therefore it is of interest to study directly the electric field induced spin - density .",
    "a strategy followed by some authors is to discretize the rashba hamiltonian in terms of a tight - binding model which is then studied near the band edge . in this way",
    "the spin - hall induced spin accumulation in systems with linear dimensions of several tens of the fermi wavelength have been studied [ ] .",
    "macroscopic systems are conveniently described in terms of semiclassical kinetic equations [ ] , and in particular in terms of diffusion equations describing the coupled dynamics of spin and charge degrees of freedom . in clean systems , however , the spin relaxation length can become comparable to the elastic mean free path .",
    "in this situation the spin dynamics is not diffusive , and one has to go beyond the diffusive approximation . in what follows",
    "we present a theory of the spin - hall effect in terms of quasiclassical green s functions , which covers the full range from clean systems to the diffusive limit .",
    "the first step is the derivation of the equation - of - motion , the eilenberger equation .",
    "from there we derive the continuity equation for charge and spin , and obtain explicit expressions for the current densities . for the rashba model it follows that no spin current can flow in a time and space independent situation . in the clean limit",
    "we find a solution of the equation - of - motion which corresponds to the universal spin - hall effect . in the general case of disordered finite systems",
    "we solve the equation - of - motion numerically .",
    "we start from the hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the internal magnetic field due to the spin - orbit coupling and @xmath5 is the vector of pauli matrices . in the rashba model for example",
    "for a spin @xmath7 particle one can write the spectral decomposition of the hamiltonian in the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the eigenenergies corresponding to the projectors @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the unit vector in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "we write green s functions in wigner coordinates , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the fourier transform of the relative coordinate and @xmath14 is the center - of - mass coordinate . for the green functions we make the ansatz @xmath15 where the curly brackets denote the anticommutator .",
    "@xmath16 are retarded and advanced green s functions in the absence of external perturbations , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the retarded and advanced self - energies which will be specified below .",
    "the ansatz guarantees that in equilibrium the matrix of green s functions with small letters is @xmath19 the main assumption for the following is that we can determine @xmath20 such that it does not depend on the modulus of the momentum @xmath13 but only on the direction @xmath21 . under this condition @xmath20",
