    "in linear algebra , a symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its transpose .",
    "but , in operator theory , a symmetric operator on a complex hilbert space @xmath2 is an operator that is its own adjoint .",
    "so , if @xmath2 is finite - dimensional with a given orthonormal basis , this is equivalent to the condition that the matrix of @xmath3 is hermitian , i.e. , equal to its conjugate transpose @xmath4 .",
    "but , the study of complex symmetric operators has been flourished near the intersection of operator theory and complex analysis .",
    "the term complex symmetric stems from the fact that @xmath5 is a complex symmetric operator on a hilbert space @xmath2 if and only if there is an orthonormal basis of @xmath2 with respect to which @xmath5 has a symmetric matrix representation with complex entries .",
    "about half a century age , glazman laid the foundations for the theory of unbounded complex symmetric operators @xcite .",
    "since then , his fundamental ideas have been successfully tested on several classes of differential operators @xcite .",
    "the general study of complex symmetric operators was undertaken by s.r .",
    "garcia in @xcite .",
    "one of his work , that is of interest in this paper , is on the norm closure problem for bounded complex symmetric operators .",
    "he proves that the set of all bounded complex symmetric operators on a separable , infinite - dimensional hilbert space is not norm closed @xcite .",
    "recently many other researchers have obtained some results for the set of all complex symmetric operators .",
    "for example , it is shown that this set is transitive and 2-hyperreflexive with constant 1 @xcite .    in this article , we look at this from a different point of view . at first , we define a suitable metric @xmath6 on @xmath7 , the set of all closed densely - defined linear operators from hilbert space @xmath2 to finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath8 . already , metric geometric properties , such as compactness of the class of admissible sets , metric convexity , and normal structure are examined @xcite .",
    "then , we introduce the notion of complex symmetric operator ( not necessarily bounded ) acting between two different hilbert spaces and study the closure @xmath9 of the set @xmath10 of all densely - defined complex symmetric operators from hilbert space @xmath2 to finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath8 , with respect to this new effective metric .",
    "let @xmath11 be a complex banach space and let @xmath12 be the open unit ball in @xmath11 . let the poincar metric @xmath13 on @xmath14 , the open unit disc in the complex plane @xmath15 , be given by @xmath16    let @xmath17 be two points of @xmath12 .",
    "an analytic chain joining @xmath18 and @xmath19 in @xmath12 consists of @xmath20 points @xmath21 in @xmath14 , and of @xmath22 holomorphic functions @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 since @xmath12 is connected , given @xmath18 and @xmath19 , an analytic chain joining @xmath18 and @xmath19 in @xmath12 always exists , provided that @xmath22 is sufficiently large .",
    "let @xmath25 where the infimum is taken over all choices of analytic chains joining @xmath18 and @xmath19 in @xmath12 .",

    "we denote the open unit ball of @xmath29 , the space of all bounded linear operators from @xmath8 to @xmath2 , by @xmath30 . for each @xmath31",
    ", we define a transformation @xmath32 on @xmath30 setting @xmath33 we collect the facts about this transformation that we need in the following lemma .",

    "now , we evaluate the operator @xmath41 : @xmath42 from this equation we see at once that @xmath43(i - a^*a)^{-1}(i - a^*z)\\nonumber\\\\ ~&=&z(i - a^*z)^{-1}[i - a^*a](i - a^*a)^{-1}(i - a^*z)\\nonumber\\\\ ~&=&z.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    statement ( ii ) was shown in theorem 2 of @xcite . to prove statement ( iii ) : it is easy to check that if @xmath8 is finite dimensional , then the norm topology of @xmath29 coincides with the strong operator topology while wot coincides with the weak topology of @xmath29 . in this case , the wot - continuity of @xmath32 was noticed and used by krein @xcite .",
    "we denote the space of all closed densely - defined linear operators from @xmath2 to @xmath8 by @xmath7 .",
    "the first relaxation in the concept of operator is to not assume that the operators are defined everywhere on @xmath2 .",
    "hence , densely - defined operator @xmath44 is a linear function whose domain of definition is dense linear subspace @xmath45 in @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath5 is closed if its graph , @xmath46 , is a closed subset of space @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath48 and define @xmath49 and @xmath50 settings as : @xmath51 @xmath52    consider operator @xmath11 such that the compositions are well - defined .",

    "hence , @xmath57 .",

    "that is , @xmath63 is surjective .",
    "@xmath64 is a positive self - adjoint operator and , for @xmath65 : @xmath66 hence , @xmath63 is a bijective mapping with a positive bounded self - adjoint inverse on @xmath2 such that : @xmath67    on the other hand : @xmath68 hence : @xmath69 that is : +    @xmath70   for @xmath71 .    since @xmath72 is bijective , @xmath73 is dense in @xmath2",
    ". operator @xmath74 is closed since @xmath5 is closed and @xmath72 is bounded @xcite .",
