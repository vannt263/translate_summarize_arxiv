    "the fundamental physics and principles that can be observed and tested by the exceptional precision of pulsar timing includes ( @xcite ) :    relativistic precession + shapiro delay + einstein delay + gravitational waves + variation in g + chandrasekhar mass + spin - orbit coupling + ultra low frequency gravitational waves + strong equivalence principle + lorentz invariance + conservation laws    at this meeting esposito - farse gave an update on the first 4 items and summary of the parametrised post - newtonian formalism ( ppn ) .",
    "will ( 1993 ) also discusses the ppn formalism in detail and gives limits on many of the ten ppn parameters .",
    "taylor et al .",
    "( 1992 ) discuss many other relativistic effects which could in principle be measured with sufficient precision .",
    "limits on the ppn parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 will be discussed here in relation to the last two items .",
    "tests of the strong equivalence principle ( sep ) giving limits on @xmath4 will also be discussed due to the similar nature of the tests .",
    "these tests are null tests and it is the 90% confidence level limits which are quoted .    in placing such limits , one wishes to know the extent to which strong field effects are contributing .",
    "measurement of a given ppn parameter @xmath5 contains both a weak field contribution @xmath6 and a strong field contribution @xmath7 ( @xcite ) @xmath8 here @xmath9 , @xmath10 represent the compactness ( @xmath11 ) of the bodies involved . for the sun , @xmath12 , for a neutron star @xmath13 and for a black hole @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , strong field effects are poorly constrained by solar system experiments , while pulsars provide comparable sensitivity and ease of study when compared to black holes .",
    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has been chosen as the absolute frame in most studies . while some recent results ( @xcite ) have questioned this ,",
    "it is the magnitude , not the direction of the absolute velocity @xmath15 that is most relevant ; this is similar for both the cmb and lauer & postman data .",
    "one might ask whether the similar nature ( i.e. upper limits from low eccentricity orbits ) of the tests discussed below ( which constrain @xmath4 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) makes them degenerate .",
    "this is not the case ; there are sufficient degrees of freedom and different figures of merit for each test so that different pulsars are being used for each test .",
    "if a gravitational interaction is not lorentz invariant ( ppn @xmath17 , due to some long - range tensor field ) , an oblate spinning body will feel a torque ( @xcite ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the angular velocity .",
    "this torque would cause the spin axis to precess about @xmath15 . since the spin - orbit coupling between the sun and planets is weak",
    ", the close alignment ( @xmath20 ) of the spin and orbital angular momenta means that the above torque is weak .",
    "quantitatively , the limit is @xmath21 , showing that the gravitational interaction is lorentz invariant to high precision ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are two important assumptions made here : primordial alignment of the spin and orbital angular momenta and that the sun has not made many rotations and by chance is closely aligned at the present epoch .",
    "pulsars play a role in confirming that the second assumption is valid since if the torque was sufficiently large to cause the sun to make many rotations it would also be large enough to cause the fastest pulsars to precess out of view ( @xcite ) , assuming they do not have fan beams .",
    "nordtvedt ( 1987 ) also considered preferred location effects as distinct from the above preferred frame effects .",
    "the resulting lagrangian for a three - body interaction contains the ppn parameter @xmath3 . using the galactic center as a distant third body yields @xmath22 , giving a limit on @xmath3 similar to the limit on @xmath1 by the same arguments .",
    "the tests discussed in sections [ sep ] , [ a1 ] and [ abp ] search for the presence of eccentricities induced in pulsar orbits . these are gravitational analogues of the stark effect , with the orbits being polarised in particular directions .",
    "however there is a non - zero probability that the relativistic precession of the orbit may cause cancellation with the intrinsic eccentricity of the system .    the problem of the possible cancellation was first considered by damour and schfer ( 1991 ) .",
    "they noted that , if the binary pulsar system is old compared to the time scale for precession , so that many rotations had been completed , then a statistical treatment of the probability of cancellation was sufficient since the goal was an upper limit rather than a measurement .",
    "a more precise statistical treatment was derived by wex ( 1996 ) who also demonstrated the power of using multiple systems to improve the limits .",
    "the sep requires the universality of the free fall of self - gravitating objects , i.e. in the same gravitational potential , two bodies should feel the same acceleration regardless of their mass , composition and density .",
    "nordtvedt ( 1968 ) showed that if sep did not hold for the earth - moon - sun system , the moon s orbit would be eccentric and polarised with the semi - major axis pointing towards the sun .",
    "so began the now famous lunar - laser - ranging experiments which searched for this polarisation using the apollo 11 reflector and measurement uncertainties of @xmath24 ns in the time of flight .",
    "damour and schfer ( 1991 ) pointed out the need for such a test in a strong field regime and showed that it is possible using binary pulsars .",
    "they suggested that the earth - moon - sun system be replaced with a pulsar - companion - galaxy system .",
    "if the companion is a white dwarf , the composition , density and self gravity is very different to the pulsar giving sensitivity to strong field effects .",
    "damour and schfer ( 1991 ) showed that the figure of merit for choosing the best test systems is @xmath25 and used psr b1953 + 29 to obtain the limit @xmath26 .",
    "arzoumanian ( 1995 ) suggested that psr b180027 could be used to improve this limit to @xmath23 , however it is not clear that this system is sufficiently old ( @xcite ) .",
    "if several pulsars are used simultaneously the multiplication of small probabilities leads to the very rigorous bound of @xmath23 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if preferred reference frames exist and @xmath28 , then there is a constant forcing term in the time evolution of the eccentricity vector of a binary system . for a very low eccentricity orbit",
    ", this tends to `` polarize '' the orbit , aligning the eccentricity vector with the projection onto the orbital plane of the absolute velocity of the system .",
    "hence , the orbital parameters of very low eccentricity binary pulsars such as psr b1855 + 09 may be used to set an upper bound of @xmath29 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this compares with limits from solar system data of @xmath30 ( @xcite ) .    the most circular orbit known ( @xmath31 ) , that of psr j2317 + 1439 ( @xcite ) has a figure of merit @xmath32 10 times better than psr b1855 + 09 .",
    "however , the more unfortunate orientation with respect to the cmb and poorly constrained radial velocity means that only a factor of 3 improvement was possible , giving a limit of @xmath33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "as shown by nordtvedt and will ( 1972 ) , a non - zero @xmath35 induces a contribution to the perihelion precession of the planets in the solar system .",
    "the two planets with the best measurements of periastron advance were earth and mercury . by combining the observations for two planets it is possible to eliminate the terms involving other parameters , obtaining @xmath36 ( @xcite ) .",
    "using the limits on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 a limit of @xmath37 was thus obtained .",
    "a tighter limit on @xmath35 has been obtained by considering the effect of the acceleration @xmath38 on the observed pulse periods of isolated pulsars .",
    "the observed pulse period @xmath39 , contains a contribution from the doppler effect due to the radial velocity @xmath40 .",
    "similarly any radial acceleration @xmath41 contributes to the observed period derivative @xmath42 .",
    "self accelerations are directed perpendicular to both @xmath15 and @xmath43 .",
    "if self accelerations were contributing strongly to the observed period derivatives of pulsars , roughly equal numbers of positive and negative observed period derivatives would be expected , since the spin axes and therefore the self accelerations are randomly oriented .",
    "the observed distribution of normal pulsars ( excluding those pulsars in globular clusters ) contains only positive period derivatives , allowing a limit of @xmath44 to be placed ( @xcite ) . using millisecond pulsars , bell ( 1996 )",
    "obtained a limit of @xmath45 .      for a binary pulsar with a white dwarf companion , we again have two bodies with very different self gravities and sensitivities to strong field effects . if @xmath46 , the induced self - acceleration of the white dwarf would be negligible compared to that of the pulsar .",
    "hence , we now have a rocket in a binary system .",
    "since @xmath47 is perpendicular to @xmath48 and since the spin and orbital angular momenta are aligned for recycled systems , the @xmath47 is in the plane of the orbit .",
    "the resulting effect is a polarised orbit similar to those predicted by sep violations ( section [ sep ] ) and lorentz invariance violations ( section [ a1 ] ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the figure of merit for choosing the best test systems is @xmath49 .",
    "selecting appropriate systems and applying the statistical treatment of relativistic precession ( section [ s;pre ] ) gives a limit of @xmath50 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the only other ultra - high - precision null experiments ( giving limits of order @xmath51 on a dimensionless theoretical parameter ) of which we are aware , are the recent hughes - drever - type tests ( @xcite ) , shown in figure 14.2 of will ( 1993 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that tests involving binary pulsars can rank , together with modern laser - cooled trapped atom experiments , among the most precise null experiments of physics .",
    "the figures of merit indicate how strongly these tests depend on the orbital periods and eccentricities of binary pulsars .",
    "the dotted lines in figure [ pbe ] indicate the relative slopes of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "there are also strongly evolutionary links expected between @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xcite ) as shown by the solid line .",
    "comparison of the slope of this curve , with the figure of merit dependence on @xmath54 and @xmath55 indicates that scope for improvements of the sep test is small unless more longer orbital period systems can be found . a similar conclusion for the @xmath2 limit",
    "can be drawn but the additional dependence on @xmath56 , ( @xmath57 ) makes it less clear .",
    "the flatter dependence on @xmath54 of @xmath58 means that short orbital period systems are preferable .",
    "however , only upper limits are presently available for many of these ( figure [ pbe ] ) .",
    "if these upper limits could be reduced substantially , it should be possible to usefully improve the limit on @xmath0 , especially if several systems are used .",
    "the limits on @xmath1 and @xmath3 may be improved slightly , by careful consideration of pulse profile changes of the fastest pulsars to obtain limits on the precession .",
    "however there is another more promising approach .",
    "if the orientation of the spin and orbital angular momenta could be determined for binary millisecond pulsars it would be possible to improve the limits on @xmath1 and @xmath3 by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the inclination of the psr j1012 + 5307 orbit has been determined from optical observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "it may be possible to obtain the orientation of the pulsar spin axis from polarisation observations . with only one system ,",
    "the ambiguity of many rotations would remain remain , but with several such binary systems , statistical arguments similar to those used for @xmath4 and @xmath2 could provide very strict limits ."
