    "detailed analyses were made by several authors with the microscopic @xmath7 cluster model about 25 years ago .",
    "the @xmath7 gcm ( generator coordinate method )  @xcite and @xmath7 rgm ( resonating group method )  @xcite calculations showed that the second @xmath2 state of @xmath6c ( @xmath18=7.65 mev ) , located at @xmath19=0.38 mev above the @xmath7 threshold , has a loosely coupled @xmath7 structure , although the ground state is a shell - model - like compact state . on the other hand , special attention has been paid to an @xmath0-type condensation in symmetric nuclear matter , analogue to the bose - einstein condensation for finite number of dilute bosonic atoms such as @xmath20rb or @xmath21na at very low temperature where all atoms occupy the lowest @xmath10 orbit  @xcite .",
    "several authors  @xcite showed the possibility of such @xmath0-particle condensation in low - density nuclear matter , although the ordinary pairing correlation can prevail at higher density .",
    "this result suggests that dilute @xmath0 condensate states in finite nuclear system may exist in excited states as a weakly interacting gas of @xmath0 particles .",
    "recently , a new @xmath0-cluster wave function was proposed which is of the @xmath22 particle condensate type  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath0-particle creation operator , @xmath25 denotes the internal wave function of the @xmath0 cluster , @xmath26 is the center - of - mass coordinate of the _ i_-th @xmath0 cluster , and @xmath27 presents the antisymmetrizer among the nucleons belonging to different @xmath0 clusters .",
    "the important characteristic of the wave function is that the center - of - mass motion of each @xmath0 cluster is of @xmath10-wave type .",
    "applications of the condensate - type wave function to @xmath6c and @xmath28o  @xcite indicated that the second @xmath2 state of @xmath6c ( @xmath18=7.65 mev ) and fifth @xmath2 state of @xmath28o ( @xmath18=14.0 mev ) , around the @xmath7 and @xmath29 threshold , respectively , are conjectured to be dilute @xmath22 condensate states , which are quite similar to the bose - einstein condensation of bosonic atoms at very low temperature .",
    "the calculated nuclear radii for both of those states are about 4 fm , significantly larger than that for the ground state ( about 2.5 fm ) . as for @xmath6c , a detailed analysis with a deformed alpha condensate wave function , slightly different from the spherical one in eq .",

    "the gross - pitaevskii - equation approach  @xcite is useful to explore such dilute multi @xmath0 systems , because this equation  @xcite , based on mean field theory , has succeeded in describing the structure of the bose - einstein condensation for dilute neutral atomic systems , for example , @xmath20rb or @xmath21na , at very low temperature , trapped by an external magnetic field",

    "if the @xmath8 state of @xmath6c is an ideal dilute @xmath0-condensate , the single @xmath0-particle orbit in the state should be of the zero - node long - ranged @xmath10-wave type with an occupation probability of @xmath37 , as suggested from the gross - pitaevskii - equation approach  @xcite .",
    "the antisymmetrizer @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ schuck_type_wf ] ) generally perturbs the single @xmath0 motion in the nucleus , and one should remember that the condensate - type wave function can also describe the shell - model - like compact structure of the ground state of @xmath6c . the effect of the antisymmetrizer should have a close relation to the rms radius of the nucleus or the distance between @xmath38 clusters in a nucleus .",
    "the ideal @xmath7 condensate state is expected to be realized if the distance between two arbitrary @xmath0 clusters is large enough so that the effect of the antisymmetrizer can be neglected .",
    "the calculated nuclear radius for the @xmath8 state of @xmath6c , about 4 fm  @xcite , suggests that the action of the antisymmetrizer is weakened significantly in that state . in order to give more decisive theoretical evidence that the @xmath8 state of @xmath6c as well as the @xmath9 state has dilute @xmath7 condensation structure , it is needed to study quantitatively the bosonic properties such as single @xmath0-particle orbits and corresponding occupation probabilities , starting from the microscopic wave function .",
    "the first attempt to derive the @xmath0-boson properties for @xmath2 states in @xmath6c from a microscopic model was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath7 rgm equation was solved in terms of the correlated gaussian basis with the stochastic variational method .",
    "although they formulated a derivation of the @xmath7 boson wave function starting from the microscopic @xmath7 wave function , the @xmath0 bosonic properties of @xmath6c were studied not with the @xmath7 bosonic wave function but with the normalized spectroscopic amplitude , because the derivation of the @xmath7 boson wave function is numerically difficult due to the non - local properties of the norm kernel .",
    "although the normalized spectroscopic amplitude seems to be a good approximation for the boson wave function in the region where the effect of the antisymmetrizer is negligible , the approximation becomes worse when the spatial overlap of the @xmath7 clusters becomes larger .",
    "it is requested to demonstrate quantitatively how good the approximation is for the @xmath8 state within their framework .",
    "the purposes in the present paper are twofold .",
    "first we study the bosonic properties such as single @xmath0-particle orbits and occupation probabilities for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states in @xmath6c with direct use of the wave function obtained by the @xmath7 ocm ( orthogonality condition model )  @xcite .",
    "the ocm is a semi - microscopic model and a simple version of the rgm , taking into account properly the antisymmetrization among nucleons , which successfully describes the structure of @xmath6c .",
    "@xcite   the second purpose is to explore the possibility of the dilute @xmath7 condensation with _ negative _ parity within the present framework .",
    "the @xmath17 ( @xmath16 ) state of @xmath6c at @xmath39 ( 3.57 ) mev above the @xmath7 threshold appears at the same energy region as that for the @xmath8 ( @xmath18=0.38 mev ) and @xmath9 ( 2.6 mev ) states . according to the old theoretical study based on the @xmath7 gcm and rgm calculations  @xcite , the nuclear radius of the @xmath5 state is intermediate between a compact shell - model - like state ( @xmath14 ) and a loosely coupled @xmath7 cluster state ( @xmath8 ) , while the @xmath4 state has a radius only a little smaller than that of the @xmath8 state .",
