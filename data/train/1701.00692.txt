    "heavy quarkonium is a multiscale system covering all regimes of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which make it an ideal place to study strong interactions  @xcite . despite the success of qcd in the high energy region , due to asymptotic freedom",
    ", the nonperturbative effect dominates at low energies and brings problems to perturbative calculation .",
    "one tool to study this non - perturbative effect is lattice qcd .",
    "however , due to its huge calculation work , it is still unable to calculate all the physical quantities with the current computation power .",
    "another important approach is to develop various phenomenological models . among these phenomenological models ,",
    "the quark model is a prominent one . under the quark model framework ,",
    "various types of interactions have been suggested by various groups , and they have achieved many impressive successes ( see e.g. refs .",
    ". however , these potential models can not be the whole story .",
    "one important missing ingredient is the mechanism to generate quark - antiquark pairs which enlarge the fock space of the initial state , i.e. , the initial state contains multiquark components .",
    "these multiquark components will change the hamiltonian of the potential model , causing mass shift and mixing between states with the same quantum numbers or directly contributing to an open channel strong decay if the initial state is above the corresponding threshold .",
    "these consequences can be summarized as unquenched effects or coupled - channel effects .    through various approaches , such as the @xmath7 model  @xcite , flux - tube breaking model  @xcite , microscopic decay models  @xcite , @xmath8 matrix analysis  @xcite , coupled - channel effects",
    "are extensively studied in many literatures ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite )    despite these pioneering works , we find that at least two factors have the potential to jeopardize the calculations of the coupled - channel effects .",
    "one is the widely used simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) wave function which approximates the realistic wave function in the wave function overlap integration .",
    "as already pointed out in our previous work @xcite , the sho approximation is not good , especially for states near thresholds , and it is essential to treat the wave functions precisely .",
    "another is the assumption that the contribution of the excited meson loops is negligible .",
    "take the bottomonium , which is the system we study in this paper , as an example .",
    "two reasons may explain why this approximation is widely used .",
    "one is that the threshold corresponding to the excited @xmath0 mesons is higher than the ground state @xmath9 threshold ; thus the coupled - channel effects is expected to be small .",
    "another is that the calculations of the excited @xmath0 mesons contributions are more complicated , an effective method to do the calculation is still not widely known .    as explained in@xcite , the gaussian expansion method plus the techniques of transformation between the cartesian and spherical basis",
    "can , in principle , do the sophisticated calculations .",
    "another observation is that the first excited @xmath2 wave @xmath0 meson is only around @xmath10mev heavier than the ground state @xmath0 meson .",
    "this mass difference is less than one tenth of the @xmath0 mesons mass .",
    "given the fact that the quantum numbers of @xmath11 are different from the ground state @xmath0 mesons , and the coupled - channel effects do rely on the quantum numbers , the suppression purely originates from the larger mass may be not as large as what has been taken for granted .    the sum of all the intermediate meson loops is more than just a calculation challenge , it may also lead to profound physics . in the light sector , a series of works by geiger _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite show us that even though different intermediate meson loops contribute to the breaking of okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule , under some simplifications ( such as neglecting the mass difference in the denominator ) , they contribute destructively , leaving us a perfect ozi rule .",
    "if one only sums over some of the meson loops , one may leave with a wrong conclusion .",
    "one should not confuse their calculation with what we are going to do in this work .",
    "they studied the flavor - changing process , such as @xmath12 .",
    "however , we mainly focus on the mass shift and their cancellation does not happen to our case . for states below the threshold , the intermediate loops always contribute a negative mass shift . even though for the above threshold case , where the mass shift may add destructively , the mass difference does matter in the real calculation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , under the flux - tube breaking model , geiger and isgur also showed that if one adds up all the intermediate states , the mass shift caused by coupled - channel loops does not converge when two assumptions are adopted ; i ) the meson wave function is the sho wave function , and ii ) the string length between the generated quark pairs is zero . in the @xmath7 model , this conclusion needs to be checked or recalculated , because the sho approximation is far from true , which was already stressed before and the vertex of the quark generation is different from the flux - tube breaking model .",
    "there are also some studies of the excited meson loops for heavy quarkonium . in the charmonium sector , a lattice calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that @xmath13 and @xmath14 has small but non - negligible components of @xmath15 . in bottomonium sector , loops involving a @xmath11 meson are proven to be critical to explain the large breaking of the heavy quark spin symmetry of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however , these studies focus on some specific states , and systematic studies of the excited meson loops is still missing .",
    "to summarize , it remains to be answered or clarified whether the ground state approximation is good or not , and the general properties of the excited meson loops still need to be systematically exploited . in this work",
    ", we try to answer these questions under the framework of the @xmath7 model .",

    ", there are four @xmath60 wave @xmath0 mesons . nevertheless , the predicted @xmath61 and one of the @xmath62 are still not experimentally observed .",
    "as far as the coupled - channel is concerned , the missing of these two states is not a real problem . because the mass of @xmath37 quark is very large , it is safe to assume that the heavy quark spin symmetry does not break . under this limit ,",
    "it is reasonable to set the mass of @xmath63 and missing partner of @xmath64 to be the same as @xmath64 .",
    "there is a mixing between @xmath65 and @xmath66 to form the experimentally observed @xmath64@xcite .",

    ", we are going to discuss some interesting structures of the plots .",
    "when the states are far below the threshold , the mass shift is always negative [ as indicated in eq .",
    "[ mshift ] ] , and closer to the threshold means an increase of @xmath74 .",
    "when the mass goes higher , the magnitude of @xmath50 is no longer monotonically increasing but oscillating , which reflects the node structure of the wave functions .",
    "this phenomenon happens to both cases whether @xmath11 mesons contributions are considered or not .",
    "a specific example would help to clarify this point .",
    "for @xmath16 , which we treat it as @xmath5 , @xmath75 is generally the largest but there is a big dip around @xmath76 gev with parameters in tab .",
    "[ paratab ] ; however , in ref.@xcite s parameters , this channel s contribution always grows . in these cases",
    ", it is difficult to make a solid conclusion about the spectrum behavior , i.e. , the spectrum is sensitive to the potential parameters .",
    "this conclusion also agrees with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the most notable impact of @xmath11 family is the unexpected large contributions to the mass shift , and generally , @xmath75 is the largest .",
    "even for @xmath77 , which is far below the threshold , @xmath78 is 14 times larger than @xmath79 .",
    "compared with the case that only considers the ground states @xmath0 mesons contributions , threshold effect is more clearly reflected when the excited @xmath0 mesons is included , because open channels due to different multiplets are well separated .",
    "the first open bottom threshold is @xmath80gev .",
    "when the mass approaches to this value , the denominator @xmath81 approaches to 0 in eq .",
    "[ mshift ] ; thus , there is an enhancement of @xmath50 from the @xmath82 channel . from the @xmath83 case in fig .",
    "[ shiftcompare ] , one can clearly see the sharp increase of @xmath79 between @xmath84 and @xmath85gev , while the slop of the other channels does not change much because their threshold is 450mev larger .",
    "the threshold effect is broken in some degree by the nodes of the wave functions .",
    "the peaks and valleys of the wave function are more likely to cancel with each other for higher excited states , leaving a relatively small slope of @xmath50 .",

    "an direct consequence of the large @xmath75 is that the parameters only considering ground state @xmath0 mesons to reproduce the experimental data are somewhat incomplete or even misleading .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the parameters to some degree , since the results are based on two different sets of parameters ( refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) , both give large @xmath75 .",
    "it seems feasible that to fit the spectrum , one may tune the parameters , such as the mass renormalization term @xmath40 in eq .",
    "[ potential ] , to absorb this unexpected large mass shift , or take a further step , weaken the confine potential to reflect the fact that closer to the threshold generally means more suppression of the mass .",
    "this could be a possible way out , if someone only focuses on the spectrum .",
    "however , as pointed out in our previous work  @xcite , the mass shift only reveals one aspect of the coupled - channel effects .",
    "to be specific , the big contribution of @xmath3 not only brings us the large mass shift @xmath50 , but also the large fraction of meson pairs ( or equivalently , small @xmath97 ) .",
    "this renormalization of the wave function can not be accommodated in the framework of the potential model .",
    "the large contribution of @xmath11 mesons reminds us that it is essential to do the _ ab initio _ calculations of coupled - channel effects .",
    "however , before really carrying out these calculations , one may naturally ask this question ,  how large are the contributions of the states beyond @xmath11 or how to evaluate all the intermediate meson loops ? \"    it is very difficult to offer a complete answer to this question .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that we can still estimate the contributions up to @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , by analyzing the mass shift behavior carefully , we can draw some model independent conclusions .    first of all , we are trying to precisely evaluate the loops .",
    "of course , since the @xmath4 mass and its wave functions are not known , the calculation has to be model dependent , which is inevitable .",
    "so far , the @xmath4 meson has not been experimentally well determined and its mass is model dependent . for our purposes , it is sufficient to take an average of several theoretical estimations in refs .",
    "@xcite , and for the consistency treatment of the wave functions , the @xmath4 wave functions are still deduced from our parameters .",
    "we define the ratio r:= [ rdefine ] to tell how large are the contributions of @xmath4 .",
    "as will be explained below , in the calculation when @xmath4 are involved , we adopt the gaussian form factor which reveals the size of the generated quark pairs ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this form factor modifies @xmath98 to be h_i = _",

    "@xmath4 can contribute an additional @xmath103 of the @xmath50 .",

    "however , with a form factor @xmath104 fm , the @xmath50 of @xmath4 is suppressed to less than @xmath105 .",
    "the previous question is partly answered , the form factor is indispensable if one needs to suppress the contributions of @xmath4 . however , with the increase of @xmath106 in @xmath87 family , the form factor works less and less efficiently to suppress @xmath101 .",
    "[ defined in eq .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    another effect of the form factor is that it adds more peaks to the oscillation of @xmath50 .",
    "this result has a pictorial explanation .",
    "since the form factor effectively serves as a cutoff , this term will generally suppress every channel s contribution .",
    "the key point is that different channels are suppressed by a different magnitude . with the increase of the nodes of the wave functions of bottomonia and @xmath0 mesons , at some specific energy point , @xmath4",

    "both of them locate around @xmath112gev .",
    "given the fact that the wave functions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are quite different , yet they both have the same sharp peaks at the same energy points , it turns out to be more than just a coincidence .",
    "@xmath101 is convenient to estimate @xmath4 s relative contributions ; however , it can not tell whether the peak is due to the suppression of the denominator or the increase of the numerator .",
    "the complete information is encoded in @xmath50 itself . in fig .",

    "no matter whether the form factor is considered or not , the @xmath4 still contribute around @xmath116 of the total mass shift for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "in other words , the form factor fails to suppress @xmath4 s contributions .",
    "this strongly indicates that only adding the gaussian form factor is not adequate to result in a complete calculation of the coupled - channel effects under the @xmath7 framework .",
    "one may argue that the coupled channel effect can be absorbed into the smeared potential which returns wave functions broader than those of the cornell model .",
    "these broad wave functions indeed somewhat suppress the higher excited states contributions .",
    "however , based on our experience ,   changing the size of the wave functions is also not able to solve the convergence issue .",
    "we conclude this section with some comments on the @xmath7 model . in the classical @xmath7 model , the suppression due to the natural cutoff from wave functions and the increase of the denominator of eq .",
    "[ mshift ] are too weak .",
    "even with the remedy of the gaussian form factor , if one does not choose the cutoff @xmath99 carefully , one will enhance instead of suppressing the @xmath4 contribution .",

    "@xcite ) . in our case",
    ", we show that this approximation leads to the bad convergence of the sum of the excited meson loops for highly excited bottomonia .",
    "the rich structure of the quark pair generation vertices may help to solve the convergence issue .",
    "for example , the hamiltonian of the flux - tube breaking model suppresses the generation of the farther quarks , one will expect that it is harder to generate excited intermediate states .     +    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ccofftb ] , contributions from the regions that are farther from the flux - tube line can be dropped , as a result , the excited mesons contribution is naturally suppressed . without this dynamical suppression , it is more difficult to suppress @xmath4 s contributions even with the modified version of the @xmath7 model , where the form factor is added .",
    "in this paper , under the @xmath7 model framework , we explicitly calculated the excited @xmath0 mesons contributions to the coupled - channel effects for the bottomonium .",
