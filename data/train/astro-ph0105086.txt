    "the field really came to life with the advent of array detectors , leading to the first faint nir imaging surveys  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to read these and other early papers , where we find discoveries , concerns and hypotheses that have stayed with us ever since : pgs , extremely red objects ( `` eros '' as pg candidates , or high@xmath6 ellipticals , or dust  enshrouded galaxies ) , extremely blue objects ( with rapid , cosmologically significant star formation ) , ero clustering , uv ",

    "while many of the issues remain the same today , the data quality has advanced tremendously , largely driven by progress in array technology , and most recently by the leap into space with _ hst_/nicmos ( affording high angular resolution and far lower backgrounds ) .",
    "survey sensitivities have improved by a factor of @xmath10 , source densities have increased @xmath11fold , and we can now image the detailed morphologies of high redshift galaxies in their rest  frame optical light .",

    "n at @xmath15 , using nicmos data to extend previous work based on ground  based nir photometry  @xcite . using a sample of 33",
    "spectroscopically confirmed galaxies  @xcite , we compared 7band ( 0.32.2  @xmath5 m , observed frame ) photometry to empirical spectral templates for nearby galaxies and to population synthesis models in order to evaluate constraints on the lbgs stellar content and evolutionary histories .",

    "even with high  quality _ hst _ optical / infrared photometry , we find only weak constraints on most parameters of the lbg stellar populations , with degeneracies between age , star formation time scale , metallicity and extinction .",
    "perhaps the best constraints , however , are those on the total stellar mass @xmath23 ( see fig .  [ massplot ] ) . if the lbg star formation history @xmath24 is modeled by an exponential , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( and extinction ) as free parameters , then with fixed assumptions about the imf and metallicity , the typical 68% confidence interval on log  @xmath23 is approximately @xmath28  dex .",
    "for lbgs with @xmath29 uv luminosities  @xcite , the inferred stellar masses ( assuming a salpeter imf , and varying the model metallicities ) are 1 to @xmath30 for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath31 ( used here unless otherwise noted ) .",

    "we set an upper bound on the allowable stellar mass by considering how much light from a hypothetical , maximally old stellar population ( formed at @xmath34 ) could be hidden beneath the glare of the young , star  forming population . on average ,",
    "this upper bound is a factor of @xmath3 to @xmath36 larger than the mass derived for the `` young '' models .",
    "if this were generally the case , however , then virtually all galaxies with previous generations of star formation at @xmath37 must _ also _ be forming stars rapidly at @xmath0 .",
    "we see very few candidates for mature , red , non  star  forming galaxies in this redshift range , even with a nicmos  selected sample where photometric redshifts should , in principle , readily identify such galaxies if they are present ( see fig .  [ umbvsz ] ) .",

    "n galaxies , we may examine the rest  frame @xmath1band luminosity distribution of galaxies at @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ lfbrest ] ) . over the luminosity range we can examine , this is not dissimilar to the local @xmath1band luminosity function ( lf )  @xcite .",
    "galaxies with @xmath38 and @xmath39 contribute a total blue luminosity density @xmath40 .",

    "is shown for comparison . ]",
    "although the optical luminosity densities are similar at @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the implied stellar mass densities are quite different .",
    "galaxies at @xmath0 are far bluer than local counterparts ( fig .",
    "[ umbvsz ] ) , indicating much smaller mass  to  light ratios . from our modeling  @xcite for 22 hdf ",
    "n lbgs at @xmath0 , we derive an average @xmath44 to 0.25 ( in solar units ) , depending on assumptions about metallicity and imf .",

    "@xmath46 for the stellar populations are smaller .",
    "there is a trend of @xmath46 with rest ",
    "frame color , amounting to a factor of @xmath47 over the observed color range of the spectroscopic lbg sample , but we neglect this here and apply @xmath48 from the spectroscopic lbgs to the photometric redshift sample .",
    "the majority of galaxies with photometric redshifts @xmath38 have colors similar to or bluer than those in the spectroscopic sample ( fig .  [ umbvsz ] ) .    restricting our attention to a salpeter imf , the starburst dust attenuation law  @xcite , and model metallicities 0.2 to 1@xmath49",
    ", we estimate a stellar mass density @xmath50 to @xmath51 at these redshifts . comparing this to the present  day stellar mass density computed from the 2df+2mass @xmath52band luminosity function  @xcite , using the same imf assumptions , we find @xmath53 to 0.058 .",
    "it is also 814@xmath54 smaller than the estimated mass density from bright galaxies at @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "this is presumably a lower limit for several reasons .",
    "first , our assumed cosmology results in a nearly minimal luminosity density for currently acceptable values of the cosmological parameters . an einstein  de  sitter model increases by the luminosity and mass densities by @xmath5680% .",
    "second , we have made no corrections for incompleteness in the nicmos  selected galaxy sample , nor any attempt to extrapolate to objects fainter than the hdf / nicmos detection limit . finally , as described in  2",
    ", the galaxy masses may be larger if there were earlier generations of star formation .",
    "if we assign _ every _ lbg its _ maximum _ ( at 68% confidence ) stellar mass ( see  2 ) allowing for a older generation of stars formed at @xmath34 , then for the adopted cosmology we may set a conservative upper bound on the total stellar mass density contained within nicmos  detected galaxies , @xmath57 .",
    "this upper bound is barely consistent with the hypothesis that all stars in present  day galactic spheroids formed at @xmath58  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "all galaxies must have already formed most of their stars at @xmath37 , but must also be forming more stars at @xmath2 ( since there are are few candidates for evolved , non  star  forming hdf galaxies at that redshift ) . as described above , a more direct accounting for the mass present in nicmos  detected galaxies at @xmath2 implies a much smaller fraction , @xmath3% , of the present  day stellar mass density .",
    "infrared surveys described here have really just begun to address the most important questions about the mass assembly history of galaxies . a new generation of infrared instrumentation , on the ground and in space ,",
    "will carry us further along down this road .",
    "deep nir surveys are still limited to very small solid angles and thus volumes at high redshift .",
    "new large format detectors will greatly improve this situation , although unfortunately very few cameras for 810 m telescopes ( whose aperture is really needed to study @xmath59 galaxies ) are being configured with wide fields of view . the first multi ",
    "object nir spectrographs are just now coming on line ; these will permit wholesale spectroscopy of distant galaxies at rest ",
    "frame optical wavelengths , offering a means of measuring kinematic masses and chemical abundances at high redshift . on _ hst",
    "_ , the infrared channel of wide field camera  3 will offer a big advance for faint galaxy surveys , offering a field of view @xmath60 larger than that of nicmos , with 1.7@xmath54 better pixel sampling .",

    "sized regions will become routine , enabling wholesale studies of the rest ",
    "frame optical morphologies , luminosities and colors of galaxies at @xmath61 , and color  selected surveys for galaxies at @xmath9 .    despite the promises usually made for nir surveys ( see  1 ) , our census of the stellar content of galaxies at @xmath59 is still fundamentally limited by the wavelengths at which we can observe .",
    "the @xmath62 and @xmath52bands measure rest ",
    "frame @xmath1 and @xmath63band light at @xmath64 , leaving large uncertainties on estimates of stellar mass , ages , and other such parameters , while brave first attempts at 37  @xmath5 m do not go deep enough to detect galaxies at @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "the _ sirtf _ infrared array camera ( irac ) , observing at 3.68.0  @xmath5 m , can measure rest  frame @xmath52band light from galaxies out to @xmath65 and @xmath66  @xmath5 m emission out to @xmath67 .",
    "extremely deep exposures will be required , however , to detect ordinary galaxies at such large redshifts .",
    "we will be carrying out a _ sirtf _ legacy program , the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) , which will push observations at 3.624  @xmath5 m to their limits in two fields ( the hdf ",
    "n and chandra deep field south ) totaling approximately 330  arcmin@xmath13 . the survey goal is to provide multiwavelength data suitable for tracing the mass assembly history of galaxies and their energetic output from star formation and agn activity out to the highest accessible redshifts .",
