    "with these high quality stacked spectra , we can now begin to assess the driving factor behind the spread in rest - frame colors of quiescent galaxies .",
    "the three possibilities include age , dust or metallicity variations amongst galaxy populations .",
    "the difference in rest - frame @xmath24@xmath25 and @xmath25@xmath26 colors corresponding to 1 gyr of passive aging within the @xcite models results in a 0.4 mag vector parallel to the quiescent sequence .",
    "similarly , increasing the metallicity from log(z)=0.02 ( solar ) to log(z)=0.05 or adding 0.5 mag of dust reddening following the @xcite dust law results in an almost identical vector in both direction and magnitude . due to degeneracies between age , dust and metallicity , it is notoriously difficult to differentiate which of these effects dominates .",
    "metallicity variations will cause the color spread in galaxies to increase over time as the galaxies passively evolve , reaching a roughly constant scatter for the oldest stellar populations . as noted by @xcite , the trend for the intrinsic scatter in the rest - frame colors of massive quiescent galaxies to steadily decrease from @xmath58 to the present epoch",
    "( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is opposite to that predicted from metallicity variations alone .",
    "we therefore expect that metallicity will not have a large effect at high redshifts .",
    "as the shape of the balmer/4000  break depends sensitively on the treatment of dust reddening , one would ideally need to correlate direct , independent measurements of the ages of massive galaxies with their colors .",
    "surprisingly , @xcite did not find a simple correlation between the rest - frame color and the strength of the balmer absorption lines , as some of the reddest galaxies in the spectroscopic sample had strong balmer absorption lines .",
    "however , with a small sample size of 13 galaxies , it is difficult to gauge if these results are representative of the overall quiescent population .    in figure",
    "[ fig : stacks ] , we plot the median stacked spectra in two rest - frame color bins for the 171 quiescent galaxies , as color - coded in figure  [ fig : uvj ] .",
    "the total number of galaxies in each bin is labeled in figure  [ fig : uvj ] and the number of galaxies per wavelength bin is indicated in the top histogram of figure  [ fig : stacks ] .",
    "a minimum number of 20 galaxies was required per wavelength bin to ensure a robust measurement .    here",
    ", we assess the effects of age as a function of rest - frame color for a mass - limited sample of quiescent galaxies by measuring the strength of absorption features such as mg i and h@xmath2 .",
    "both of these spectral features are sensitive to the age of the stellar population , but not very sensitive to metallicity or dust reddening . given the narrow baseline of the spectral features , dust extinction is not expected to have a significant effect . at the grism resolution",
    ", the h@xmath2 absorption feature is expected to be about 45% stronger in a 1 gyr stellar population as compared to a 2 gyr stellar population , whereas the mg i absorption feature is about 34% weaker . increasing the metallicity results in a slightly deeper mg i feature , but only on the order of @xmath59 . to first order ,",
    "any change measured in h@xmath2 and mg i is due to age differences between the galaxies .",
    "the average age of galaxies with the bluest rest - frame colors is @xmath8 gyr , consistent with the expectation that they are in the `` post - starburst '' phase @xcite .",
    "these galaxies clearly show significantly stronger h@xmath2 and h@xmath36 absorption than the reddest galaxies .",
    "note the difference in shape of the blended g - band and h@xmath36 between these two stacks .",
    "the redder galaxies are 0.7 gyr older on average , with a best - fit age of @xmath7 gyr . for a 0.7 gyr",
    "age difference , the @xcite models predict @xmath60 and @xmath61 , corresponding to exactly the observed difference in the median rest - frame colors of the two bins .",
    "the older quiescent galaxies show clear signs of either central residual star - formation activity or an agn , while the enhancement in the younger galaxies is not well - constrained despite a well - determined spectroscopic age .",
    "we measure the residual [ oiii]@xmath45 and h@xmath2 line fluxes for the younger and older populations , finding ratios of @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "the bluer galaxies lack a clear [ oiii ] feature , although the difference with the redder galaxies is only marginally significant .",
    "we present stacked grism spectroscopy of a mass - limited sample of 171 quiescent galaxies at @xmath1 from the 3d - hst treasury program @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that we can resolve absorption features such as the g - band ( @xmath34304@xmath4 ) , h@xmath644861@xmath4 ) , mg i ( @xmath35175@xmath4 ) , and na i ( @xmath35894@xmath4 ) in the median stacks due to the high quality grism redshifts .",

    "furthermore , the [ oiii]@xmath45/h@xmath2 ratio of 0.9 for a median mass of @xmath67 m@xmath30 places the average quiescent galaxy within the liner region of the mass - excitation diagnostic diagram @xcite , albeit marginally consistent with the `` composite '' crossover region within the error bars . from the average",
    "dust - corrected [ oiii ] ( @xmath35007@xmath4 ) luminosity , we infer that quiescent galaxies may have a typical agn luminosity of @xmath57 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "these results are consistent with the recent work of @xcite , who find that 70100% of massive quiescent galaxies at @xmath68 contain a low- or high - luminosity agn .",
    "the potential ubiquitous nature of agns in massive , quiescent @xmath0 galaxies provides observational support that black hole accretion may be more effective at the high - mass end ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to understand the relationship between rest - frame color and our spectroscopic age measurements , we further stack the data in two rest - frame color bins .",
    "we find that the bluest quiescent galaxies have a more prominent h@xmath2 absorption line , with best - fit ages of @xmath8 gyr , confirming the idea that these galaxies are the most recently quenched .",
    "furthermore , we find that redder quiescent galaxies ( 80% of the population ) have an older age of @xmath7 gyr .",
    "although previous spectroscopic studies have measured similarly old ages ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this is the first time we are able to probe the full population .",
    "these results suggest that age varies significantly with the colors of quiescent galaxies , consistent with @xcite .",
    "galaxies with the reddest rest - frame colors likely have some degree of dust extinction , as dust - free models can not produce such red colors at these redshifts .",
    "dust extinction does not greatly affect the line - index measurements for single stellar populations given the narrow baseline of the spectral features , but its effect can be significant for the 4000  break @xcite .",
    "consequently , although the absorption features of the 3d - hst stacks will be effectively independent of dust extinction , the rest - frame color can change significantly in the presence of dust due to its sensitivity to the continuum shape .",
    "we can not rule out that the reddest galaxies have a potentially significant contribution from younger , dusty quiescent galaxies .",
    "nonetheless , despite this caveat , we measure a significant age difference between the two populations of 0.7 gyr that is consistent with the observed rest - frame color differences .",
    "the key result from this paper is that we have conclusively demonstrated that old , quiescent galaxies exist in large numbers at @xmath0 .",
    "this is not a surprise given extensive previous results that were based on broadband and medium - band photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ground - based spectroscopy for small samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but our detection of metal lines in the stacked spectrum puts any lingering concerns to rest .",
    "our result also implies that the `` uvj technique '' , first described in @xcite , is very effective in identifying quiescent galaxies at @xmath0 .",
