    "there are compelling reasons to believe that the dark matter of the universe is constituted in large part of non - baryonic collisionless particles with very small primordial velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "generically , such particles are called cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the leading cdm candidates are the axion and the lightest supersymmetric partner in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of elementary particles .",
    "the latter candidate is a weakly interacting massive ( mass in the 10 to 100 gev range ) particle , or wimp for short .",
    "the former has mass in the @xmath0 to @xmath1 ev range and is extremely weakly interacting , so weakly in fact that it was once thought ",
    "invisible \" .",
    "wherever a galaxy forms , the surrounding cdm falls into the galactic gravitational potential . unlike baryons , cdm is collisionless and sloshes back and forth in the potential well , producing a galactic halo of size much larger than the extent of the visible matter .",
    "the local ( i.e. , on earth ) dark matter density of the milky way halo is of order @xmath2 .",
    "this local dark matter is in principle detectable and considerable effort is being spent on projects devoted to this goal .",
    "dark matter axions can be detected by their conversion to microwave photons in an electromagnetic cavity permeated by a strong static magnetic field @xcite .",
    "wimps can be detected by observing the recoil energy of nuclei off which wimps have scattered elastically @xcite .",
    "wimp dark matter may also be detected indirectly by observing , on earth , neutrinos produced in the annihilation of wimps which accumulated in the interior of the sun @xcite .    from the point of view of these dark matter",
    "searches it is desirable to know as much as possible about the phase - space distribution @xmath3 of cdm in galactic halos in general , and particularly in the milky way halo .",
    "one wants to know not only the local density but also the local velocity distribution . in the cavity dark matter",
    "axion detector , the kinetic energy spectrum of dark matter axions can be measured with great resolution @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the velocity distribution may therefore be exploited to increase the sensitivity of the search . in wimp searches ,",
    "knowledge of the velocity spectrum is necessary to calculate the annual modulation of the signal @xcite .",
    "this annual modulation is an important means by which the signal to background ratio can be enhanced .    yet , in spite of this urgent need of the ongoing cold dark matter searches , there is at present no consensus about the phase - space structure of galactic halos .",
    "let us discuss briefly the three main approaches which have been put forth .",
    "the oldest description of galactic halos is the isothermal model @xcite .",
    "it postulates that the phase - distribution is given by boltzmann s law , the energy of each particle being its kinetic energy plus its gravitational potential energy in the presence of all the other particles .",
    "it can be shown that the dark matter density then falls off as @xmath4 for large values of the galactocentric distance @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the model predicts that galactic rotation curves are flat ( @xmath6 constant ) at large @xmath5 , and that is indeed what is observed .",
    "another virtue of the model is that it predicts that at small @xmath5 , within some radius called the core radius @xmath7 , the density @xmath8 goes to a constant , and hence that the halo contribution to galactic rotation curves @xmath9 at small @xmath5 .",
    "that also is consistent with observation .",
    "the model predicts all properties of galactic halos in terms of just two parameters : the velocity dispersion @xmath10 and the core radius @xmath7 . in fits to observed properties of our own halo , @xmath10 is found to be approximately 270 km / s and @xmath7 of order several kpc .",
    "the isothermal model is simple and gives an excellent overall description of what is observed , but there is little justification for its basic assumption , that the dark matter particles in galactic halos are thermalized .",
    "thermalization may have occurred during an early phase of violent relaxation @xcite at the time of collapse of the protogalaxy .",
    "it is possible that the dark matter that fell onto the galaxy at early times was thermalized by that process . but an isolated galaxy such as the milky way is still accreting dark matter today because it is surrounded by a sea of dark matter .",
    "( the presence of m31 and the other members of the local group is not relevant for the purpose of this discussion . )",
    "there is no evidence of violent relaxation occurring in the galaxy at the present time .",
    "the infalling dark matter particles form flows which slosh back and forth in the gravitational potential of the galaxy . the flows do not get thermalized over the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "gravitational scattering by inhomogeneities , such as globular clusters and molecular clouds , is too weak to diffuse the flows entirely , except for those flows which always remained within the inner parts ( @xmath11 kpc , say ) of the galaxy .",
    "the flows can be described in terms of the evolution of the 3-dim .",
    "sheet on which the dark matter particles lie in 6-dim .",
    "phase - space @xcite .",
    "before the onset of galaxy formation , the equation of the sheet is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hubble expansion rate and @xmath14 is the peculiar velocity field associated with density perturbations .",
    "the thickness of the sheet is the primordial velocity dispersion @xmath15 .",
    "the primordial velocity dispersion of the leading cold dark matter candidates is extremely small , of order @xmath16 for wimps and @xmath17 ( at most ) for axions .",
    "the sheet can not tear and hence its evolution is constrained by topology . where a galaxy forms , the sheet wraps up in phase - space , turning clockwise in any two dimensional cut @xmath18 of that space .",
    "@xmath19 is the physical space coordinate in an arbitrary direction and @xmath20 is the associated velocity .",
    "the outcome of this process is a discrete set of flows at any point in a galactic halo .",
    "two flows are associated with particles falling in and out of the galaxy for the first time ( @xmath21 = 1 ) , two other flows are associated with particles falling in and out of the galaxy for the second time ( @xmath21 = 2 ) , and so on .",
    "the number of such flows at the earth s location in the milky way is of order 100 @xcite .",
    "the flows of particles which have fallen in and out of the galaxy only a small number of times in the past ( @xmath22 ) are not expected to be thermalized .",
    "the flows with larger @xmath21 may be thermalized because they are composed of particles which fell in a long time ago .",
    "caustics appear wherever the projection of the phase - space sheet onto physical space has a fold @xcite .",
    "caustics are generically surfaces in physical space . on one side of the surface",
    "there are two more flows than on the other . at the surface ,",
    "the dark matter density is very large .",
    "it diverges there in the limit of zero velocity dispersion .",
    "there are two types of caustics in the halos of galaxies , inner and outer .",
    "the outer caustics are topological spheres surrounding the galaxy .",
    "they are located near where a given outflow reaches its furthest distance from the galactic center before falling back in , and are described by @xmath23 ( or fold ) catastrophes .",
    "the inner caustics are rings @xcite .",
    "they are located near where the particles with the most angular momentum in a given inflow reach their distance of closest approach to the galactic center before going back out .",
    "a caustic ring is a closed tube whose cross - section is a @xmath24 ( also called _ elliptic umbilic _ ) catastrophe @xcite .",
    "the existence of these caustics and their topological properties are independent of any assumptions of symmetry .",
    "a second approach to describing the structure of galactic halos is in terms of these flows and their associated caustics @xcite .",
    "let us call that approach the caustic ring model since caustic rings are one of its prominent features . in the model the caustic ring radii , and indeed the whole phase - space distribution , are calculated assuming that halo formation is a self - similar process @xcite .",
    "the model depends on only three parameters : the galactic rotation velocity @xmath25 , a parameter @xmath26 which is proportional to the amount of angular momentum in the halo , and a parameter @xmath27 which describes the profile of the initial overdensity from which the galaxy forms .",
    "@xmath27 is related to the slope of the evolved power spectrum of primordial density perturbations and hence , to the extent that that spectrum is predicted by cdm cosmology , @xmath27 is not a free parameter .",
    "if the primordial spectrum is harrison - zeldovich , @xmath27 is in the range 0.2 to 0.35 . @xcite .",
    "in that range , the self - similar model predicts that the density @xmath4 at large @xmath5 .",
    "hence the model predicts that galactic rotation curves are flat at large @xmath5 , which is consistent with observation .",
    "when @xmath28 , the @xmath29 behavior extends to small @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath30 singularity at @xmath31 is due to the fact that the dark matter particles move on radial orbits in that limit .",
    "however , the dark matter particles are expected to carry angular momentum . when @xmath32 , the density is depleted within an effective core radius @xmath33 . as a result , the halo contribution @xmath34 to the rotation curve goes to zero as @xmath35 , which is also consistent with observation .",
    "evidence for the presence of caustic rings in our galaxy was found in the distribution of rises in the milky way rotation curve , and in a triangular feature in an iras map of the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the feature is reminiscent of the shape of the @xmath24 catastrophe .",
    "when the model is fitted to these observations , its parameters are determined to be : @xmath36 220 km / s , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the model predicts the dark matter flows and caustics in the solar neighborhood . because of our proximity to the fifth caustic ring ,",
    "one of the flows dominates over all others combined .",
    "its density and velocity vector ( known only up to a two - fold ambiguity ) relative to the non - rotating restframe of the galaxy are @xcite : d_5^+ = 1.7 10 ^ -24gr ^3 ,   _ 5 = ( 470  _ g 100  _ g)km  .",
    "[ bigflow ] @xmath39 is the local unit vector in the direction away from the galactic center , and @xmath40 is in the direction of galactic rotation .",
    "a list of the other flows is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the caustic ring model describes the minimum phase - space structure that a galactic halo must have .",
    "the actual phase - space structure can not be simpler than that .",
    "a third approach to studying the structure of galactic halos is by means of n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "initial density perturbations are chosen according to a theoretically expected probability distribution , e.g. gaussian density perturbations with the cdm power spectrum evolved from a flat harrison - zeldovich primordial spectrum .",
    "overdensities grow in the simulations and form structures which are identified with galactic halos . in the large n limit",
    ", the outcome of the simulations can be identified with the predictions of cdm cosmology . however , present constraints on computing power restrict n to be of order @xmath41 per galactic halo .",
    "in contrast , the number of axions per galactic halo is of order @xmath42 , and the number of wimps of order @xmath43 . since phase - space is 6-dim .",
    ", the resolving power of the simulations is only a factor of ten in each dimension , including the three physical space dimensions .",
    "the simulations do show that galactic halos are not thermalized and that they contain discrete flows .",
    "however , the limited resolution allows only a few flows to be seen .",
    "the simulations predict that a large galaxy like our own has hundreds of satellites .",
    "the tidal disruption of these satellites produces low velocity dispersion streams @xcite which are in effect localized flows .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect of the sun s gravitational field on a flow of collisionless dark matter through the solar system .",
    "this effect was analyzed several years ago by k. griest @xcite in the case of the isothermal model .",
    "he calculated the annual modulation of the signal in wimp detectors including the effects both of the earth s orbital motion and the sun s gravity .",
    "earlier discussions of the effect of the sun s gravity on a flow of ordinary collisionful matter can be found in papers by h. bondi and f. hoyle @xcite , j.m.a .",
    "danby and g.l .",
    "camm @xcite , and danby and t.a .",
    "bray @xcite .",
    "we will study mainly the effect of the sun s gravity on a single flow of collisionless dark matter in the limit of zero velocity dispersion .",
    "the effect of finite velocity dispersion can be taken account by integrating over a distribution of initial velocities .",
    "our results can be applied to the calculation of the annual modulation of the signals in both the axion and wimp dark matter detectors .",
    "we plan to do this in detail in a subsequent paper which will be concerned with the experimental implications of the present investigation . in the remainder of this introduction",
    ", we give a general discussion of the annual modulation of the signal in the axion and wimp detectors , including the role of the sun s gravity .",
    "a flow produces a peak in the energy spectrum of photons produced by axion @xmath44 photon conversion in the cavity detector of dark matter axions @xcite .",
    "the peak s frequency @xmath45 is determined by the energy conservation relation , @xmath46 , in terms of the flow speed relative to the laboratory . because the earth rotates",
    ", there is a diurnal modulation of the peak s frequency . by measuring the average frequency and the amplitude and phase of the modulation",
    ", one can derive the velocity vector @xmath47 of the flow relative to the earth ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the height of the peak is proportional to the flow density .    on top of the diurnal modulation",
    ", there is a much larger annual modulation because the earth orbits the sun ( @xmath49 ) : |(t ) = m_a [ c^2 + 1 2 ( _ flow ( t))^2 ] = m_a [ c^2 + 1 2 ( _ flow ( t ) - _ ( t))^2 ]  , [ annual ] where @xmath50 is the peak frequency averaged to remove the diurnal modulation .",
    "@xmath51 follows from the earth s orbital motion .",
    "( [ annual ] ) then gives @xmath52 in terms of @xmath53 , the flow velocity relative to the sun .",
    "however , galactic halo models give the velocity @xmath54 of the flow long before it reaches the sun .",
    "for example , for the big flow of eq .",
    "( [ bigflow ] ) , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the velocity of the sun relative to the galaxy .",
    "@xmath53 differs from @xmath54 because the flow is affected by the gravitational field of the sun .",
    "the relationship between @xmath54 and @xmath53 depends on position and hence , as the earth orbits the sun , on time .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to derive this relationship .",
    "note that a single flow of velocity @xmath54 far from the sun , produces more than one flow in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "we call @xmath57 the number of flows at position @xmath58 .",
    "we want to calculate @xmath59 for each of the flows @xmath60 .",
    "we also want to calculate the density @xmath61 of each of the flows .",
    "the simplest case is when the sun is treated as a point mass .",
    "then , @xmath62 everywhere .",
    "indeed there are two different ways in which particles coming with velocity @xmath54 from far away can reach an arbitrary location @xmath58 .",
    "1 . we will find a caustic line downstream of the sun , on the positive @xmath63-axis if @xmath64 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath54 . indeed",
    ", every trajectory passes by some point on the positive @xmath63-axis ; the latter is a focal line .",
    "we will see that the density diverges there as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the distance to the @xmath63-axis .",
    "we call this caustic the spike.    in reality the sun has finite radius .",
    "this implies that there is a maximum scattering angle @xmath67 . as a result , at large distance @xmath68 from the sun , @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the polar angle relative to the direction of @xmath74 . on the conical surface which separates the @xmath69 and @xmath71 regions ,",
    "there is a caustic , which we call the skirt. the spike caustic along the @xmath63-axis downstream from the sun remains as in the point mass case . as the earth moves around the sun",
    ", it may come close to the spikes associated with some of the flows and it will go through many of their skirts . when it approaches these caustics , the density becomes larger .",
    "we will see that the profile of the skirt caustic is a functional of the mass distribution inside the sun .",
    "we may optimistically envisage a time where the axion dark matter detector on earth , monitoring the peak sizes associated with various flows , provides information about the solar mass distribution .",
    "wimp detectors measure the nuclear recoil energy when a wimp scatters elastically off a nucleus in the detector @xcite .",
    "the events caused by a single flow of wimps produce a plateau in the distribution of measured recoil energies .",
    "the edge of the plateau is at the highest recoil energy compatible with the kinetic energy of the wimp .",
    "the highest recoil energy occurs when the collision is back - to - back in the center of mass .",
    "it is therefore a simple function of the mass of the nucleus , the mass of the wimp and the speed of the wimp in the laboratory frame . in principle",
    ", a wimp detector can measure the speed of each of the flows by measuring the edge of the corresponding plateau in the recoil energy distribution .",
    "if the detector has directionality @xcite , it may determine the directions of the flows as well as their speeds .",
    "all wimp detectors are presently sensitive to the local dark matter velocity distribution through the annual modulation effect @xcite .",
    "the event rate in a wimp detector is proportional to the flux of wimps through the detector .",
    "( in contrast , the axion to photon conversion rate in the cavity detector of dark matter axions is proportional to the density of axions , not their flux . )",
    "the wimp flux changes in the course of the year as the velocity of the earth s orbital motion around the sun adds to or subtracts from the velocity of the sun with respect to the galactic halo .",
    "interestingly , the annual modulation effect in wimp detectors distinguishes between the isothermal and caustic ring models of the galaxy . in the isothermal model ,",
    "the halo has zero average velocity everywhere .",
    "it has no net angular momentum , no rotation .",
    "the sun moves with velocity of order 220 km / s in the direction @xmath40 of the galactic disk rotation",
    ". the earth moves with speed 30 km / s around the sun in a plane , called the ecliptic , inclined at approximately @xmath75 relative to @xmath40 .",
    "the direction of @xmath76 is closest to @xmath40 on about june 2 .",
    "the wimp flux , and hence the signal in a wimp detector , is highest then .",
    "it is lowest six months later , near december 2 .",
    "the amplitude of the modulation is of order @xmath77 . in the caustic ring model , on the other hand ,",
    "the halo does have net angular momentum .",
    "the locally dominant flows , such as eq .",
    "( [ bigflow ] ) , have velocity components in the @xmath40 direction of order 470 km / s , more than twice the velocity of the sun in that direction .",
    "relative to the sun , the average flow of dark matter is in the @xmath78 direction in the caustic ring model , whereas it is in the @xmath79 direction in the isothermal model .",
    "so the annual modulation in the caustic ring model @xcite has opposite sign to that of the isothermal model : the event rate in wimp detectors is largest near december 2 , lowest near june 2 .",
    "non - isothermal galactic halo models other than the caustic ring model are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the dama experiment in the gran sasso laboratory claims to have observed the annual modulation of the wimp signal @xcite .",
    "the dama results are consistent with the prediction of the isothermal model , and inconsistent with the caustic ring model .",
    "however , almost all of the region of wimp mass and elastic scattering cross - section space implied by the dama signal is ruled out by the null result of the cdms dark matter search @xcite . some of the region is also ruled out by the null result of the edelweiss experiment @xcite .    at any rate ,",
    "it is clear that the annual modulation is an important way to distinguish signal from background in wimp searches , and that it deserves the best possible theoretical treatment .",
    "most calculations and discussions neglect the effect of the sun s gravity .",
    "however , as we mentioned already , the sun s gravity effect was analyzed by k. griest for the case of the wimp signal in the isothermal model @xcite . in that model",
    "the flow of dark matter relative to the sun produces a wake in the @xmath79 direction .",
    "we may think of it as a spike caustic except that it is spread out in space because of the large velocity dispersion ( @xmath80 km / s ) of the flow .",
    "we reanalyze the effect of the sun s gravity on the annual modulation of the wimp signal in section v. our results there are in qualitative agreement with those of griest .    in summary ,",
    "our purpose is to study the effect of sun s gravity on a flow of collisionless dark matter in the limit of zero velocity dispersion .",
    "the effect of finite velocity dispersion can be taken account by integrating over a distribution of initial velocities .",
    "the results can be applied to the flows , or streams , predicted by any specific halo model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a general discussion of cold ( i.e. , zero velocity dispersion ) flows and associated caustics .",
    "we derive formulas for the density of such flows that will be useful in subsequent sections . in section iii",
    ", we derive the density and velocity distributions of a stationary cold dark matter flow past a point mass . in that case , all the results are analytical and exact . in section iv , we derive the density and velocity distributions of a stationary cold dark matter flow past a spherically symmetric mass distribution like that of our sun . in this case , the trajectories that go through the sun are calculated numerically .",
    "the skirt caustic phenomenon appears here . in section",
    "v , we extend our formalism to dark matter velocities with arbitrary velocity distribution , and apply the results to the isothermal model as an example . in section",
    "vi , we summarize our findings .",
    "here we derive expressions for the physical space density of a flow with zero velocity dispersion , using the general approach of ref . @xcite . in such a flow",
    "each particle carries a 3-dimensional label @xmath81 the flow is entirely defined by giving the positions @xmath82 of all particles at all times .",
    "the velocity of particle @xmath83 is @xmath84 in general , the map @xmath85 is one to many .",
    "hence , at each point @xmath58 of space , there is a discrete set of flows with velocities @xmath86 where @xmath87 are the solutions of @xmath88 @xmath89 is the number of distinct flows at @xmath90 the total number of particles is n = d^3 ( ) = d^3r _ j=1^n |_=_j(,t ) .",
