    "cosmic strings are topological defects that are predicted to have formed via the kibble mechanism @xcite during one of the phase transitions in the early universe and in the field theoretical description @xcite can be considered to be an example of a topological soliton . due to the fact that these objects can be extremely heavy ( up to @xmath0 kg / m ) they were believed to be a possible source of the density perturbations that led to structure formation and the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "however , the detailed measurement of the cmb power spectrum as obtained by cobe , boomerang and wmap showed that cosmic strings can not be the main source for these anisotropies .",
    "in recent years cosmic strings gained renewed interest due to the possible connection to the fundamental entities of string theory @xcite .",
    "brane inflation is a popular inflationary model that can be embedded into string theory and predicts the formation of cosmic string networks at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "e.g. in the framework of type iib string theory the inflaton field corresponds to the distance between two dirichlet branes with 3 spatial dimensions ( d@xmath1-branes ) and inflation ends when these two branes collide and annihilate .",
    "the production of strings ( and lower dimensional branes ) then results from the collision of these two branes .",
    "each of the original d3-branes has a u(1 ) gauge symmetry that gets broken when the branes annihilate .",
    "if the gauge combination is higgsed , magnetic flux tubes of this gauge field carrying ramond - ramond ( r - r ) charge are d - branes with one spatial dimension , so - called d - strings . when the gauge combination is confined the field is condensated into electric flux tubes carrying neveu schwarz - neveu schwarz ( ns - ns ) charges and these objects are fundamental strings ( f - strings ) @xcite .",
    "d - strings and f - strings are so - called cosmic superstrings @xcite which seem to be a generic prediction of supersymmetric hybrid inflation @xcite and grand unified based inflationary models @xcite .",
    "d- and f - strings , however , have different properties than the usual ( solitonic ) cosmic strings .",
    "the probability of intercommutation of solitonic strings is equal to one but less than one in the case of cosmic superstring .",
    "therefore , solitonic strings do not merge , while cosmic superstrings tend to form bound states .",
    "when p f - strings and q d - strings interact , they can merge and form bound states , so - called ( p , q)-strings @xcite whose properties have been investigated @xcite . even though the origin of ( p , q)-strings is type iib string theory , their properties can be investigated in the framework of field theoretical models @xcite .",
    "the influence of gravity on field theoretical ( p , q)-strings has been studied in @xcite .",
    "since there are good reasons for cosmic superstrings to be a consequence of string theory it is very exciting to search for observational consequences of their existence .",
    "there has been considerable effort in numerically modeling cosmic string networks to obtain cmb power and polarization spectra @xcite .",
    "comparison with observations has shown that cosmic strings might well contribute considerably to the energy density of the universe .",
    "there is another way to detect cosmic strings in the universe , namely through the motion of test bodies in such string space - times",
    ". the test particle motion in different space - times containing cosmic strings has been investigated in @xcite , while the complete set of orbits of test particles in the space - time of black hole pierced by an infinitely thin cosmic string has been given for a schwarzschild black hole in @xcite and for a kerr black hole in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we follow the latter approach and use the field theoretical model discussed in @xcite to describe ( p , q)-strings by two coupled abelian - higgs models in curved space - time . for vanishing coupling between the two sectors",
    ", the model corresponds to the abelian - higgs model coupled minimally to gravity .",
    "this model has solutions describing strings with finite core width that have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "geodesics in this space - time have been studied recently @xcite and can only be given numerically . here",
    "we would like to extend this investigation to the field theoretical description of cosmic superstrings .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we discuss the field theoretical model that possesses ( p , q)-string solutions and we also work out the geodesic equation . in section iii we discuss our numerical results , in particular we give examples of orbits and demonstrate how the ratio between the symmetry breaking scale and the planck mass , the ratios between higgs and gauge boson masses , the magnetic fluxes and the binding between the f- and d - string influence our results .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "the field theoretical model to describe gravitating ( p , q)-strings reads @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ricci scalar and @xmath4 is newton s constant .",
    "the matter lagrangian @xmath5 is given by @xcite @xmath6 with the covariant derivatives @xmath7 = @xmath8 - @xmath9 , @xmath10 = @xmath11 - @xmath12 of the two complex scalar fields ( higgs fields ) @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the field strength tensors @xmath15 , @xmath16 of two u(1 ) gauge potential @xmath17 , @xmath18 with coupling constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 denotes the gravitational covariant derivative .",
    "finally , the potential @xmath22 reads : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the self - couplings of the two scalar fields , while @xmath26 is the coupling between the two sectors . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields .    in order for both u(1 ) symmetries to spontaneously break which then leads to the formation of strings we have to require that the ( absolute ) minimum of the potential ( [ vpq ] ) is at non - vanishing values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this leads to the requirement @xcite @xmath31    the most general static cylindrically symmetric line element invariant under boosts along the @xmath32-direction is @xmath33 for the matter and gauge fields , we apply the ansatz @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are integers indexing the vorticity of the two higgs fields around the @xmath32-axis and correspond to the degree of the map from @xmath37 , where the homotopy group is @xmath38 . in our field theoretical model of ( p ,",
    "q)-strings the p corresponds to the winding @xmath35 and the q to the winding @xmath36 .",

    "it is possible to obtain a smooth curve for the effective potential .    in the following",
    "we will distinguish between bound orbits , escape orbits and terminating orbits .",
    "note that when we talk about bound , escape and terminating orbits we are referring to the motion in the @xmath122@xmath123plane .",
    "the particles can , of course , move along the full @xmath32axis from @xmath124 to @xmath125 for @xmath126 .",
    "bound orbits are orbits on which test particles move from a minimal value of @xmath57 , @xmath127 to a maximal value of @xmath57 , @xmath128 and back again .",
    "these orbits have hence two turning points with @xmath129 . on escape orbits , on the other hand , particles come from @xmath130 , reach a minimal value of @xmath57 , @xmath127 and move back to @xmath130 , which means that escape orbits have only one turning point with @xmath129 .",
    "looking at ( [ eq1 ] ) it is obvious that turning points are located at those @xmath57 at which @xmath131 .",
    "finally , terminating orbits are orbits that end at the string axis @xmath132 .    for all our calculations we have chosen @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "solutions to the model ( [ action ] ) have been extensively studied previously .",
    "the table [ sumsolns ] summarizes the particular cases .",
    ".known string solutions of the model ( [ action ] ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it has been observed in @xcite that there are two types of solutions if one couples the abelian - higgs model minimally to gravity : string solutions and melvin solutions which exist for the same values of the parameters in the model . these differ by their asymptotic behaviour of the metric functions at infinity .",
    "the string solution behaves like @xmath135 where @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 are constants depending on @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath139 , @xmath42 and @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",
    "for @xmath73 it has been found @xcite that @xmath142 for @xmath143 , @xmath144 for @xmath145 and @xmath146 in the bps limit @xmath147 .",
    "a solution with the asymptotics ( [ stringinfinity ] ) describes a conical space - time with deficit angle @xmath148 given by @xmath149 in linear order the deficit angle @xmath148 is given by the product of the coupling @xmath42 and the inertial energy per unit length @xmath150 with @xmath151 .",
    "as such the constant @xmath152 for @xmath153 ( or @xmath154 ) and @xmath137 decreases for either @xmath42 or @xmath150 increasing . if the coupling @xmath42 or the energy per unit length is too large then @xmath155 and the deficit angle @xmath156 . in this case the solution would have a singularity at a finite , parameter - dependent value of @xmath157 with @xmath158 , while @xmath159 stays finite .",
    "these solutions are the so - called super - massive string solutions @xcite ( or inverted string solutions ) .",
    "we will not consider these kind of solutions in this paper and will always assume the deficit angle to be smaller than @xmath160 .",
    "the `` force '' exerted on a test particle corresponds to the right hand side of @xmath161 note that for string solutions the effective potential tends asymptotically to a constant with @xmath162 and hence there is no force exerted on test particles far from the string . while the force associated to the angular momentum @xmath99 is always repulsive",
    ", the total force close to the string can either be attractive or repulsive . since @xmath163 and @xmath164 this depends on the sign of @xmath165 ( see more details below ) .",
    "for @xmath166 the string solutions behave like @xmath167 hence there is an infinite potential barrier at @xmath132 for test particles with non - vanishing angular momentum @xmath99 , i.e. these test particles can never reach the string axis at @xmath132 since their is no force to counterbalance the repulsive centrifugal force . on the other hand , for @xmath168 the effective potential tends to a constant @xmath169 .",
    "hence particles with @xmath170 can reach the string axis .",
    "since @xmath171 these terminating orbits are only possible for massive test particles with @xmath172 . + _ infinitely thin cosmic strings",
    "_  the infinitely thin limit corresponds to the case where both the width of the scalar core as well as that of the gauge field core tend to zero .",
    "the string is hence a 1-dimensional object that can e.g. be described by the nambu - goto action . in this case",
    "the metric function @xmath76 ( or some other constant that can be absorbed into the definition of @xmath173 ) and @xmath174 for @xmath175 . in this case , the only component in the force ( [ force ] ) exerted on a particle is the repulsive angular momentum contribution .",
    "hence , bound orbits are not possible in this space - time .",
    "this can also easily be understood when noting that the space - time of an infinitely thin cosmic string is locally flat @xcite and geodesics are just straight lines .",
    "the fact that bound orbits are possible in a finite width cosmic string space - time is related to the fact that close to the string axis the conical space - time is smoothed on scales comparable to the width of the string .",
    "the existence of bound orbits in `` pure '' cosmic string space - times @xcite is hence a new feature when considering cosmic strings with finite width .",
    "the melvin solutions exist for the same parameter values as the string solutions , but have a different asymptotic behaviour : @xmath176 where again @xmath177 and @xmath178 are parameter dependent positive constants .",
    "this space - time is not asymptotically flat and the proper length of a curve with @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 is @xmath183 .",
    "this tends to zero for @xmath184 . for the melvin space - time with the asymptotic behaviour ( [ melvin ] )",
    "the effective potential tends to infinity asymptotically with @xmath185 for @xmath186 .",
    "hence there is an infinite potential barrier at infinity for test particles with non - vanishing angular momentum , i.e. these particles can never reach infinity .",
    "this is related to the fact that the total force ( [ force ] ) on a test particle is always attractive at large @xmath57 in melvin space - times . for @xmath168",
    ", the effective potential tends to @xmath187 for @xmath188 .",
    "hence , the asymptotic value of the effective potential is always larger than ( for massive test particles ) or equal to ( for massless test particles ) @xmath111 .",
    "massive test particles moving on radial geodesics can thus not reach infinity , while massless test particles have a turning point at infinity .",
    "for @xmath166 the melvin solutions behave like the string solutions ( [ zero ] ) .",
    "we will mainly discuss the geodesic motion in space - times with the asymptotic behaviour ( [ stringinfinity ] ) since we believe this to be the physically relevant case .",
    "however , since the melvin solution is a solution to the abelian - higgs model coupled minimally to gravity , we will also comment on this below .",
    "the case @xmath73 , @xmath189 has been discussed for @xmath190 in @xcite . it was found that bound orbits are only possible for @xmath191 and for massive particles . in fact , in order to have bound orbits we need ( at least ) two turning points of the motion , i.e two intersection points between @xmath192 and @xmath111 . note that for @xmath111 finite and larger than the minimal value of the effective potential we will always have one intersection point for @xmath186 due to the infinite potential barrier at small @xmath57 such that escape orbits always exist .",
    "however , bound orbits are only possible if in addition the effective potential has local minima and maxima with @xmath193 . at these local extrema",
    "we should then have @xmath194 since @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 this equation has only solutions for @xmath199 .",
    "for @xmath200 it has been observed @xcite that the metric function @xmath120 is either monotonically decreasing ( for @xmath201 ) or monotonically increasing ( for @xmath191 ) , while @xmath76 in the bps limit @xmath202 .",
    "hence the sign of @xmath203 does nt change and in particular , bound orbits are only possible for @xmath191 . in this case",
    "the energy - momentum part of the force ( [ force ] ) becomes attractive for @xmath191 , i.e. if the width of the scalar core is larger than the width of the gauge field core and can balance the repulsive part associated to the angular momentum . on the other hand for @xmath202 ( @xmath204 )",
    "the width of the scalar core is equal ( smaller ) than the width of the gauge field core .",
    "we observe that this leads to a vanishing ( repulsive ) energy - momentum part in the force ( [ force ] ) and only escape orbits are possible .",
    "this is different when @xmath205 .",
    "we will first discuss the case @xmath190 .",
    "the behaviour of the metric function @xmath120 of a ( 1,1)-string for @xmath206 and different choices of @xmath140 , @xmath207 is shown in fig .",
    "[ nprof ] . in all cases",
    "the blue dotted - dashed line corresponds to @xmath73 and for cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) the green solid line corresponds to @xmath208 with @xmath209 the maximally allowed value for a given choice of @xmath210 and @xmath211 . for ( a ) @xmath212 , @xmath213 , ( b ) @xmath214 and ( c ) @xmath215 the increase of @xmath216 leads to an increase of the asymptotic value of @xmath120 for all choices of the @xmath140 , @xmath207 .",
    "hence , the increased binding between the p- and the q - string pronounces the effect already observed in the @xmath73 limit . note that while bound orbits are not possible in the bps limit @xmath214 for @xmath73 bound orbits do exist for @xmath217 and @xmath214 ( which , of course , no longer corresponds to a bps limit ) . for ( d ) @xmath218 , ( e ) @xmath219 and ( f ) @xmath220",
    "the metric function @xmath120 can have a local minimum if @xmath221 , i.e. if the binding between the strings is not too large .",
    "this is new as compared to the @xmath73 limit .",
    "we find that @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 .",

    "this has important consequences for the shape of the effective potential as discussed below and can be understood as follows : consider the ( 1,1)-string to be a superposition of a ( 1,0)-string and a ( 0,1)-string . now , for @xmath73 , these two strings do not interact . in this case , we know that for @xmath231 , @xmath52 the metric function @xmath120 would monotonically decrease , while for @xmath232 , @xmath233 the metric function @xmath120 would monotonically increase .",
    "superposing a string with @xmath234 and one with @xmath232 leads than to a metric function @xmath120 that first decreases and than increase again . note that the opposite is not possible since the scalar core of a string with @xmath231 is smaller than that of a string with @xmath232",
    "this behaviour of the metric function @xmath120 leads to the observation that the effective potential can have a negative minimum which for @xmath235 is located exactly at @xmath236 . in the case @xmath73 , the effective potential can have a local minimum for @xmath191 , but this will always be positive valued since @xmath199 means @xmath237 .",
    "this is shown in fig.[vprof ] for a particle with @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath235 . for cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) the effective potential is positive for all values of @xmath57 for non - vanishing @xmath99 or @xmath100 , while it can become negative for the other cases .",
    "in fact , the potential becomes positive everywhere for @xmath240 .",
    "this will have influence on the existence of bound orbits as discussed below .",
    "in particular if the potential has a negative valued minimum as is e.g. the case for @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 , particles with @xmath244 , i.e. @xmath245 can move on bound orbits .",
    "we have also investigated how the metric function @xmath120 changes when changing the winding numbers @xmath35 , @xmath36 and hence the magnetic fluxes along the string .",

    "infinity decreases with increasing sum @xmath248 .",
    "this is natural since an increase in the windings leads to an increase in the mass per unit length and hence to an increase of the deficit angle .",

    "the deflection of light by cosmic strings should be detectable .",
    "though the identification of cosmic strings due to their gravitational lensing effects has been discussed extensively @xcite no such cosmic string lens has been detected to date .",
    "moreover , there might also be other sources of gravitational lensing and when identifying cosmic strings through gravitational lensing it has to be made sure that no `` standard '' matter distributions are the source of the lensing . on the other hand , the negative perihelion shift seems to be generic to finite width cosmic string space - times . to state it differently :",
    "if a negative perihelion shift would be observed this would be a strong evidence for the existence of cosmic strings .",
    "the main characteristic of cosmic superstrings is that they can form bound states and our field theoretical solutions describe such bound states .",
    "the fact that bound states can form so effectively alters the set of possible orbits considerably in comparison to standard field theoretical cosmic string models .",
    "in particular , the mass ratios @xmath42 and @xmath140 have an important impact .",
