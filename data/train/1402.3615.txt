    "it will serve as an appropriate expansion parameter . as a measure for the disorder",
    "we introduce the variable @xmath19 . for any adjacent pair of sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 we define the hopping rate @xmath22 from site @xmath20 to site @xmath21 . specifically , we choose @xmath23 for transitions between equal energies , @xmath24 for the down - rate ( also denoted @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 for the up - rate ( also denoted @xmath27 ) .",
    "this choice implies that the barrier between sites with equal energy is larger than the downward barrier from a high - energy to a low - energy site .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for complex energy landscapes @xcite . for reasons of simplicity we choose @xmath28 in our analysis .    for hopping processes parallel or anti - parallel to the electric field",

    "the numerical analysis boils down to the determination of the stationary solution of the corresponding rate equations , i.e. to solving large systems of linear equations . in practice",
    ", we have solved the rate equations by the runge - kutta algorithm together with an adaptive step size and determined the stationary long - time limit .",
    "the field has been applied along the direction of one axis . for each field strength",
    "we have also inverted the electric field so that the resulting current is an uneven function of @xmath32 .",
    "we have chosen system sizes @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , all corresponding to a similar number of total sites .",

    "the current can be calculated .",
    "this procedure is performed for @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "then we fitted @xmath46 to a fifth - order polynomial in @xmath32 and extracted @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and , correspondingly , @xmath7 .",
    "we checked that a reduction of @xmath32 by a factor of two did not change the results .",
    "thus , the expansion up to the fifth order is sufficient .",
    "the final results were averaged over 10 different random realisations of the disorder .",
    "and @xmath49 as a function of @xmath13 as obtained from the numerical simulations in 3d .",

    "@xmath50 is highlighted by the broken line.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we start by showing @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the 3d case ; see fig.[fig1 ] . in the limits @xmath53 and @xmath54 the linear conductivity is identical because the particle is hopping in an energy landscape without any disorder . with the chosen normalization this conductivity equals unity .",
    "the conductivity is reduced by two orders of magnitude for intermediate @xmath13 with a minimum around @xmath55 .",
    "qualitatively , the decrease of @xmath47 for small @xmath13 is related to the fact that the number of deep - lying traps is increasing which slows down the particle .",
    "in contrast , when approaching @xmath56 from below , the residual high - energy states work as barriers , slowing down the dynamics .",
    "since the fraction of high - energy states decreases for increasing @xmath13 the conductivity increases correspondingly .",
    "the minimum reflects a crossover between the trap - regime and the barrier - regime .",
    "also the nonlinear conductivity as expressed via @xmath7 , i.e. the ratio of the nonlinear and the linear conductivity , displays two distinct regimes . since for @xmath57 and @xmath56 one",
    "has @xmath58 by construction , we discuss the behavior of @xmath59 in the following .",
    "interestingly in the trap - dominated regime one has @xmath60 , i.e. an increase of the nonlinearity as compared to the homogeneous case . in contrast ,",
    "in the barrier - dominated regime we find @xmath61 so that the nonlinearity is smaller . a physical understanding of these observations will be developed in the remaining part of this work .",
    "the simulations for higher dimensions display the same qualitative features .",
    "in our analytical calculations we always consider the case of high but finite dimensions , expressed via @xmath62 .",
    "we start with the case of a single low - energy state .",
    "this low - energy state as well as its direct neighbors are sketched in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "this region will be denoted _",
    "trap_-region .    ) local thermodynamic equilibrium is generated , motivating the notion of a trap - region with a border ( circle ) . ]    for setting up a set of rate equations we assume that all sites adjacent to the trap - region possess the same non - equilibrium population @xmath63 which , of course , depends on the applied field .",
    "later one we argue that this assumption is not required and that it is sufficient in the limit of high dimensions to identify @xmath63 with the average population .",
    "then the rate equations read @xmath64 in the stationary case the left side is zero so that one effectively obtains a system of four linear equations . in a first step",
    "one can obtain the general equation for @xmath65 and then after insertion solve for the other three populations . whereas the general expression is too complex to directly extract relevant information",
    "we restrict ourselves to the limits @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "since we always consider the case @xmath62 we express the final result as a linear expansion in @xmath68 .",
    "we start by solving this set of equations , i.e. consider a single long - energy site . in the present case",
    "we have the two small parameters @xmath68 and @xmath71 . in practice",
    "we take the exact solution of this set of linear equations , expand this expression in powers of @xmath72 and then , for fixed order @xmath72 , expand in @xmath68 .",
    "finally , one keeps those up to linear order in @xmath68 and @xmath71 .    after a straightforward but somewhat lengthy calculation one obtains @xmath73 q_{central } , \\label{left } \\\\",
    "q_{right } & = & \\frac{y^{2}}{z^2 } \\left [ 1 - \\frac{\\theta}{z}(y - y^{-1 } ) \\right ] q_{central } , \\label{right}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath74 where @xmath75 the factor @xmath76 is close to unity and keeps track of corrections due to finite disorder as expressed by @xmath77 .",
    "note that for finite field , i.e. @xmath78 , one obtains @xmath79 .",
    "this relation is of key importance for the subsequent discussion .",
    "naturally , for vanishing external field , i.e. @xmath80 , the boltzmann populations are recovered .",
    "eqs.[ortho]-[right ] have a simple physical interpretation in the limit of large disorder , e.g. when the correction due to the @xmath71-term can be neglected .",
    "if a particle is sitting adjacent to a low - energy site the probability to jump to the low - energy site is by a factor of @xmath81 larger than to jump to one of the other @xmath82 neighbor sites .",
    "thus , many forward - backward jumps will occur between the low - energy site and its neighbors . as a consequence _",
    "local thermodynamic equilibrium _ is generated around the central site which gives rise to the notation of a trap - region .",
    "the @xmath83-factors express that the external field attemps to shift the particle to the right .",
    "we mention in passing that this term has been also used in the work of riess and maier @xcite about nonlinear conductivity , but with a very different meaning .",
    "the factor of @xmath84 captures the absolute populations in the trap - region as compared to the population of the neighbors . as discussed in appendix a its value ( eq.[cy ] )",
    "can be also rationalized via straightforward flux arguments .",
    "the analysis , presented so far , was obtained under the additional assumption that all adjacent sites have the same population @xmath63 . strictly speaking",
    "this is not true because the external field induces an anisotropic modification of the population .",
    "however , as discussed in appendix b , this assumption can be relieved in the regime of high dimensions and @xmath63 can be simply interpreted as the _ average _ population of the sites adjacent to the tagged region .",
    "note that the types of sites , which allow one to obtain this conclusion , only exist for @xmath85 .",
    "thus , one might expect that major deviations are present for @xmath86 .",
    "it turns out ( see appendix b ) that all higher - order terms in the expansion of @xmath68 ( starting with @xmath87 ) would depend on the individual ( unknown ) populations . exactly in the limit of high dimensions",
    "they can be neglected .",
    "this justifies that it is reasonable to stop the expansion in @xmath68 after one term .",
    "interestingly , already this first term captures many of the features , obtained for the numerical solution in 3d ( see below ) .    of particular relevance",
    "is the variation of the population of the central site @xmath88 . due to the factor",
    "@xmath89 even a small decrease of @xmath90 from unity gives rise to a significant decrease in population of the central site , i.e. particles less likely populate the low - energy site .",
    "this population difference has to be redistributed over the whole system , i.e. to the high - energy sites .",
    "we note in passing that this phenomenon resembles the poole - frenkel effect , albeit for different physical reasons @xcite . after escaping from the trap - region as a consequence of the external field these particles",
    "can now contribute to the total current .",
    "since this population increase is induced by the external field , this effect contributes to the nonlinear response of the total system .",
    "now we generalize our analysis to a finite fraction @xmath13 of low - energy sites .",
    "one can assume that they act independently if the probability that two low - energy sites are neighbors is small .",
    "formally , this corresponds to @xmath70 .",
    "we choose the normalization such that the average population of a site is just unity , i.e. @xmath91 . in the limit of large",
    "@xmath77 a straightforward evaluation of this expression together with eqs.[central]-[right ] yields @xmath92 after an expansion in @xmath68 this can be rewritten as @xmath93 the current ( normalized per site ) , as generated by the sites beyond the trap - region is simply given by @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , one can also calculate the contribution of the trap - regions .",
    "although the population may be extremely high in this region it turns out that the current of the trap - region , i.e. @xmath95 is very small due to the factor of @xmath13 and the missing factor of @xmath77 .",
    "inserting eq.[qhigh ] in the expression for the current and evaluation of the first - order and third - order terms in @xmath32 yields after a straightforward calculation ( see appendix c ) @xmath96 naturally , for large @xmath16 one recovers the mean - field limit @xmath97",
    ".      using the same set of rate equations ( eq.[rate1 ] to eq.[rate4 ] ) as in the previous case one directly performs an expansion in @xmath68 .",
    "one obtains after a straightforward calculation @xmath99 q_{rest } , \\\\",
    "q_{right } & = & [ 1 + \\frac{1}{\\theta } ( y - 1/y ) ( z-1 ) ] q_{rest}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in contrast to the limit of large disorder the total population in the trap - region is not changed upon application of an external field . in agreement with the previous case",
    "@xmath100 is somewhat decreased ( because @xmath101 ) whereas @xmath102 increases .",
    "in analogy to the limit of large disorder normalization leads to @xmath103 .    for the current ,",
    "related to one left , one central and one right site one obtains after a short calculation @xmath104(y - 1/y)q_{rest}$ ] .",
    "the total current can be written as @xmath105 this can be rewritten as @xmath106(y-1/y).\\ ] ] with a calculation in analogy to appendix c one ends up with @xmath107 in contrast to strong disorder the nonlinearity decreases as compared to the homogeneous case .",
    "qualitatively , this is due to the fact that upon increasing the external field intensity is shifted from the left to the right site .",
    "this shift of population decreases the total current because a particle on the right side is more likely shifted back to the central site and thus contributes with a negative sign .",
    "here we deal with the limit that most sites are high - energy states .",
    "actually , this limit is already implicitly contained in the previous calculation .",
    "the same approximations would have been valid if @xmath109 . if , for the moment , we interpret @xmath13 as the number of high - energy states the value of @xmath7 is again given by eq.[sr1 ] . to keep the original notation we have to substitute @xmath13 by @xmath14 and @xmath77 by @xmath72 in eq.[sr1 ] .",
    "this yields @xmath110 thus , independent of the degree of disorder one obtains a reduction of the nonlinearity if most states are low - energy states .",
    "the explanation is analogous to before , just the signs have to be reversed . to stress the qualitative picture",
    "one may imagine one inaccessible high - energy site .",
    "the external field pushes the particles in front of this site . due to the inaccessibility the intensity @xmath100 is increased . since , this left site can not contribute to the current in field direction , there is an effective reduction in the total current .",
    "here we introduce a very different approach for the high - dimensional case which is applicable for the whole parameter regime except for the trap - regime and is more general than the solutions , discussed above . the key idea is to use a statistical description which is as close to a mean field description ( infinite @xmath16 ) as possible but still reflects the properties of finite dimensions .",
    "generally , two approximations reflect this limit .",
    "( 1 ) after an orthogonal jump the previous site is randomly given a new energy based on the energy distribution , i.e. the memory on the previous site is lost .",
    "( 2 ) for jumps along the field direction more information has to be included because these jumps determine the value of @xmath7 . here",
    "the memory is lost after two successive jumps in one direction because then the backjump probability is proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "this statistical picture is expected to break down in the case of a trap - regime ( @xmath111 and @xmath69 ) . here after an orthogonal jump from a low - energy to a high - energy site it is essential to know that the previous site was a low - energy site because very likely the system will jump back . within the statistical description ,",
    "however , the backjump probability would be very small because the energy of the previous site would be determined according to the energy distribution which would , very likely , change the energy and thus suppress the trapping property .",
    "the formal description , resulting from ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) requires the introduction of a probability @xmath112 that a particle sits on site @xmath113 and has neighbor sites with energies @xmath36 and @xmath21 anti - parallel and parallel to the field direction , respectively ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "then the corresponding master equation reads    @xmath115    for the motivation of the individual terms we start by discussing the first term .",
    "the rate of jumping from site @xmath36 to site @xmath20 in the direction of the field is proportional to @xmath116 , which is just the probability that two adjacent sites @xmath117 do exist . since we want to calculate the change in the probability @xmath112 we also have to take into account that statistical factor @xmath118 to have an adjacent site @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore a factor of @xmath119 keeps track of the direction of the jump . in summary",
    ", we obtain a contribution of @xmath120 . to calculate the gain term after an orthogonal transition ( third term ) one has to keep into mind that the rate only depends on the energy difference of the old site ( which was either plus or minus ) and the energy of the new site @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , the product @xmath121 just expresses the probability to find three adjacent sites @xmath122 . as discussed under point ( 1 )",
    ", no memory about the old site ( plus or minus ) is kept .",
    "the remaining terms can be derived analogously .    for the calculation of the stationary limit",
    "this corresponds to a set of 8 coupled linear equations .",
    "again we perform a @xmath68 expansion of the resulting population properties and , correspondingly , the resulting current . here",
    "we just present the final result which we have checked by solving these equations by maple",
    ". in lowest order of @xmath68 the current reads @xmath123 ( y-1/y).\\ ] ]    this directly yields @xmath124 most importantly , this general relation has eq.[sr1 ] and eq.[sr2 ] as limiting cases if choosing @xmath125 or @xmath126 , respectively . as described above , the trapping picture can not be described by this ansatz .",
    "the key results of this work deal with the limits @xmath70 or @xmath127 for the physical relevant limit of high disorder , i.e. @xmath69 . in a first step",

    "most remarkable , the agreement for the non - linearity @xmath59 is very good .",

    "and @xmath16 as discussed in this work . ]    in this work we have described the nonlinearity for a simple lattice model with a bimodal energy distribution in dependence of the fraction of low - energy sites @xmath13 , the disorder ( via @xmath77 ) and the dimension ( via @xmath16 ) . a clear physical picture is presented for the limits of a small number ( @xmath98 ) and a large number ( @xmath143 ) of low - energy states in the limit of large disorder ( @xmath144 ; see fig.[fig_schema ] for a sketch of the whole @xmath145-phase space . in the first case",
    "the few low - energy states serve as traps which are in a local thermodynamic equilibrium - state with the adjacent sites .",
    "this gives rise to a reshuffling of intensity to the high - energy states so that the positive nonlinear contribution is via the nonlinear increase of the current of the high - energy states , i.e. @xmath146 . in the other limit of many low - energy states",
    "the remaining high - energy states serve as barriers which accumulate intensity on the neighbor site opposite to the field direction and decreases the intensity on the adjacent site parallel to the field direction , respectively .",
    "the contribution to the total current , however , has the reverse order .",
    "thus , one obtains an effective decrease of the non - linear conductivity , i.e. @xmath147 .    note that for sufficiently large @xmath77 there exists a regime where @xmath148 does not depend on @xmath13 ( @xmath149 ) . whereas this theoretical plateau value is close to the numerical value for higher dimensions , a difference of a factor of 1.5",
    "is observed for the 3d case ( see fig.[figc1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in this limit also the @xmath77-dependence is very weak ( only via @xmath150 ) and disappears for large @xmath77 .",
    "we mention in passing that also the 2d model displays a plateau value . however , here the numerical value is even two times higher than the theoretical value ( data not shown ) .    for large disorder",
    "the theoretical predictions are not applicable in the regime @xmath151 ( see fig.[figcall ] ) .",
    "note that the critical value @xmath152 for site percolation for high dimensions is approximately @xmath68 ( e.g. @xmath153 @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that above the percolation threshold the linear conductivity strongly increases because the particles can cross the sample without using the high - energy states .",
    "the present results show that also the nonlinear conductivity shows a significant change around this critical concentration of low - energy sites .",
    "however , a closer relation of the crossover - regime to the percolation approach is beyond the scope of this work .    from a theoretical perspective one might want to consider more complex energy distributions .",
    "although the general physical mechanisms , described in this work , may remain the same , a quantitative analysis would become much more difficult if not intractable within the present approach .",
    "e.g. , the analysis of a model with three instead of two different energy levels in the barrier - regime would require the solution of 27 instead of 8 linear equations . nevertheless , the insight of the present work on the two - state model can be used to rationalize the numerical results , previously obtained for hopping models with continuous energy distributions ( see introduction ) . for a gaussian distribution",
    "the resulting nonlinearity was analyzed in dependence on the lowest energy @xmath154 of all sites @xcite . among the different realizations of the gaussian random numbers the value of @xmath154 fluctuates quite significantly .",
    "it turned out that ( 1 ) only for sufficiently low values of @xmath154 one indeed observes @xmath155 whereas otherwise one has @xmath147 and ( 2 ) in the regime of sufficiently low values of @xmath154 ( i.e. , @xmath156 ) the value of @xmath7 hardly depends on the specific value of @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "both observations can be qualitatively explained by the present results . due to the dependence on the single low - energy value @xmath154 the continuous distribution",
    "can be related to a discrete model with one particular low - energy state .",
    "qualitatively , this corresponds to the present bimodal model in the trap - regime",
    ". if @xmath157 is too small one indeed observes @xmath147 because local equilibration does not occur and the nonlinearity is explained via the barrier - mechanism .",
    "furthermore , for large @xmath77 no dependence on the disorder is observed ( explanation of observation(2 ) ) .",
    "thus , several non - trivial observations from a continuous gaussian distribution can be rationalized by the insights from the bimodal model . in previous simulations",
    "also the box - type distribution was analysed somewhat closer .",
    "it was shown that in this case one observes @xmath147 @xcite . when mapping this distribution on a bimodal distribution an appropriate choice is @xmath158 . here",
    "we obtain @xmath147 in agreement with the numerical result .",
    "the rate equations eq.[rate1 ] to eq.[rate4 ] required implementation of the approximation that the population of all neighbor sites is identical .",
    "although we found a strict argument why this approximation is not required for the validity of our approach , it is promising that the general approach eq.[formel : mod_mastergl ] yields identical results for the limits @xmath108 as well as @xmath98 together with @xmath67 .",
    "this serves as an important consistency check of the two complementary approaches , used in this work .",
    "as outlined in the introduction hopping models constitute a reasonable approach for the real - world situation in inorganic ion conductors .",
    "the previous numerical results indicated that the experimental observation @xmath146 suggests a very broad distribution of the site energies such that there exist a few sites with very low energies @xcite .",
    "however , in the previous work no physical picture for this observation could be supplied .",
    "the present work suggests that the presence of these low - energy sites gives rise to the phenomenon of local thermodynamic equilibrium which is responsible for the experimental observation @xmath146 .",
    "please note that the terminology of sites was related to the vacancy picture .",
    "going back to the ion rather than the vacancy picture the positive nonlinear effect translates into the presence of a few unfavorable sites which nevertheless have to be frequently visited by the ion due to the shortage of vacant sites .    in summary , to the best of our knowledge we have for the first time formulated quantitative predictions for the non - linear response of a disordered hopping model in high dimensions with several predictions which semi - quantitatively already hold for the experimentally relevant 3d case and hold very well for even higher dimensions .",
    "thus , the experimentally observed positive nonlinear effect indicates the presence of strong disorder with only a few sites with very low energy as outlined for the case of the gaussian distribution .",
    "a more direct experimental analysis of non - linear single - particle dynamics is possible with modern holographic - mechanical optical tweezers @xcite which can generate random potentials and may allow for a more quantitative comparison with the dynamics in disordered energy landscapes .",
    "we acknowledge very helpful discussions with b. roling , s. rthel , t. franosch , and s. egelhaaf about this project .",
    "in particular we would like to acknowledge the very fruitful collaboration with our late colleague r. friedrich on the topic of this work .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the dfg via for 1348 and sfb 458 .      here",
    "we present an alternative argument for eq.[cy ] in the limit @xmath159 . in the stationary non - equilibrium case",
    "the total fluxes in and out of the trap - region have to be identical . counting the number of possible transitions the flux balance can be written as @xmath160    neglecting the terms of order @xmath161 and using eqs.[ortho]-[right ] ( without the correction terms of order @xmath71 ) this",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath162 which after expansion in @xmath68 and comparison with eq.[ortho ] directly yields eq.[cy ] ( again without the correction terms ) .",
    "thus , the factor @xmath84 balances the increase of intensity of @xmath163 , following from @xmath164 for @xmath165 .",
    "here we show that for the derivation of the leading term of @xmath166 it does not matter whether the populations of the sites , adjacent to the trap - region , are identical or not . using a vector notation we choose the central site as @xmath167 , the left and right sites as @xmath168 and the orthogonal sites as @xmath169 .",
    "coordinates different from zero are explicitly listed .then the neighbors of the trap - region can be classified into six types : ( 1 ) @xmath170 , ( 2 ) @xmath171 , ( 3 ) @xmath172 , ( 4 ) @xmath173 , ( 5 ) @xmath174 , ( 6 ) @xmath175 . within",
    "one type all populations are identical due to symmetry reasons .",
    "the individual populations are denoted @xmath176 with @xmath177 . the number of sites @xmath178 can be easily calculated .",
    "it turns out that only @xmath179 is of order @xmath180 ( namely @xmath181 ) whereas all other @xmath178 are at most of order @xmath16 @xmath182 .",
    "the total number of sites @xmath183 is @xmath184 . denoting @xmath63",
    "as the average population of a site one has the simple relation @xmath185    in the mean - field limit @xmath186 one can write @xmath187 because the boltzmann probabilities are recovered . for finite but large dimension one can choose the expansion ansatz @xmath188 where , again , @xmath63 denotes the average population of all sites . inserting this ansatz into eq.[app1 ] and comparing all terms of order @xmath16 one immediately obtains @xmath189 .",
    "thus , in case of symmetry breaking the impact of finite order on @xmath190 is only of order @xmath87 .",
    "going back to the rate equations eq.[rate1 ] to eq.[rate4 ] one has to modify the source terms by replacing @xmath63 by the specific populations @xmath176 , defined above . after a straightforward calculation",
    "one realizes that for the relevant orders in @xmath16 only the term @xmath191 would contribute which , however , is zero .",
    "thus , all variations of @xmath176 from @xmath63 are irrelevant for the first order expansion in @xmath68 and would only show up in the higher - order terms .",
    "of course , the above arguments can be also applied for the next shell of sites around the sites considered above .",
    "again , there is one type of sites which dominates all other sites in the limit of high dimensions . reiterating this argument one can conclude that @xmath63 can be even identified with the average population of all sites of the system beyond the tagged region if one restricts oneself to the corrections of order @xmath68 .",
    "we mention in passing that for the 2d case ( @xmath192 ) one has @xmath193 .",
    "thus , the key states for argumentation only start to exist for @xmath41 and a quantitative comparison for the 2d case should be quite poor .",
    "this is indeed reflected by the actual comparison as indicated in the main text ."
