    "the inflationary paradigm , proposed and elucidated by @xcite has enjoyed resounding success in the current era of precision cosmology . not only has its broad - brush prediction of a flat universe been successful , but the more detailed predictions of the simplest inflationary models , of gaussian , adiabatic , and nearly ( but not exactly ) scale - invariant perturbations , are also perfectly consistent with the data .",
    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , in particular by the wmap satellite ( see @xcite and references therein ) , have been instrumental in these observational tests of inflation @xcite . particularly exciting",
    "is wmap s detection of an anti - correlation between cmb temperature and polarization fluctuations at angular separations @xmath9 ( corresponding to the @xmath10 anti - correlation seen on scales @xmath11 ) , a distinctive signature of adiabatic fluctuations on super - horizon scales at the epoch of decoupling @xcite , confirming a fundamental prediction of the inflationary paradigm .",
    "this is probably the least ambiguous signature of the acausal physics which characterize inflation , unlike the large - angle correlations in the cmb temperature which are contaminated by `` foregrounds '' such as the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
    "the detection and measurement of a stochastic gravitational - wave background would provide the next important key test of inflation .",
    "the cmb polarization anisotropy has the potential to reveal the signature of primordial gravity waves @xcite ; unlike the cmb temperature anisotropy , it can discriminate between contributions from density perturbations ( a scalar quantity ) and gravity waves ( a tensor quantity ) .",
    "the polarization anisotropy can be decomposed into two orthogonal modes : @xmath12-mode polarization is the curl - free component , generated by both density and gravity - wave perturbations , and @xmath13-mode polarization is the divergence - free mode , which can only , to leading order , be produced by gravity waves .",
    "the primordial @xmath13-mode signal appears at large angular scales . on smaller scales ,",
    "another effect , which is sub - dominant on large scales , kicks in and eventually dominates : weak gravitational lensing of the @xmath12-mode converts it into @xmath13-mode polarization @xcite .",
    "these considerations motivate the current observational and experimental effort , such as on - going ground - based experiments ( e.g. quadtelescope/ ] @xcite , cloveract21/clover.html ] , polarbear , quietpeterh / polarimetry / quiet3.html ] ) and planned or proposed space - based and balloon - borne missions ( e.g. planck , spiderlgg/spider@xmath14front.htm ] , ebex @xcite , cmbpol ) .    the primordial @xmath13-mode anisotropy , if it exists , is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath12-mode polarization .",
    "this , combined with the difficulty of separating primordial @xmath13-modes from lensing @xmath13-modes as well as polarized galactic foregrounds , makes the measurement of a potentially - existing primordial gravity wave background a great experimental challenge . at the same time , as it is the `` smoking gun '' of inflation , the primordial @xmath13-mode detection and measurement can be regarded as the `` holy grail '' of cmb measurements .",
    "there are five main obstacles to making a measurement of the primordial @xmath13-mode polarization , some being fundamental , and others being practical complications .",
    "the fundamental complications are : ( i ) the level of the primordial signal is not guided at present by theory : there are inflationary models consistent with the current cmb data which predict significant levels of primordial gravity waves , as well as models which predict negligible levels ; ( ii ) the signal is not significantly contaminated by lensing only on the largest scales @xmath15 few @xmath16 where cosmic variance is important ; ( iii ) polarized foreground emission ( mostly from our galaxy but also from extra - galactic sources ) on these scales is likely to dominate the signal at all frequencies .",
    "practical complications are : ( iv ) for the signal to be detected in a reasonable time - scale , the instrumental noise needs to be reduced well below the photon noise limit for a single detector , so multiple detectors need to be used ; ( v ) polarized foregrounds are not yet well known , and since any detection relies on foreground subtraction , foreground uncertainties may seriously compromise the goal .",
    "@xcite consider different foreground subtraction techniques and compute the minimum detectable @xmath17 for future cmb experiments for no lensing contamination . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show how the lensing @xmath13-mode contamination can be subtracted out in the absence of foregrounds .",
    "calculations of the minimum detectable primordial gravity wave signature on the cmb polarization data and related constraints on the inflationary paradigm have been discussed in the literature [ e.g. @xcite ] .    @xcite discuss the optimization of a ground - based experiment ( in particular , focusing on quad ) and @xcite discuss the instrumental effects that can contaminate the detection .    in this work ,",
    "we take a complementary approach .",
    "we first attempt to forecast the performance of realistic cmb experiments : space - based , balloon - borne and ground based ; considering the covariance between cosmological parameters and primordial parameters , effects of foreground contamination , instrumental noise and the effect of partial sky coverage for ground - based experiments , and then consider what these realistic forecasts can teach us about inflation .    given the recent advances in the knowledge of the polarized foregrounds @xcite and in detector technology",
    ", we then attempt here to answer the following questions : how much can we learn about the physics of the early universe ( i.e. can we test the inflationary paradigm and constrain inflationary models ) from a realistic cmb experiment ? at what point does instrumental noise and uncertainties in the foregrounds degrade the results that could be obtained from an ideal experiment ( no noise , no foregrounds ) ? what will be the limiting factor : foreground subtraction or instrumental noise ? how much can be learned from a full - sky space - based experiment vs. a partial - sky ground - based one ? and finally : given the large costs involved in improving the experiment ( reducing noise by increasing the number of detectors and improving foreground cleaning by increasing the number of frequency channels ) , what is the point of diminishing returns ?    we start in ",
    "[ sec : theory ] by reviewing recent literature on @xmath13-modes and inflationary physics , and summarizing present - day constraints on inflationary models .",
    "we describe our forecast method in   [ sec : method ] and   [ sec : foregrounds ] . in ",
    "[ sec : experiments ] we report the expected constraints on primordial parameters from a suite of experiments including instrumental noise and a realistic estimate of foregrounds .",
    "these results give us some guidance in optimizing future cmb polarization experiments for @xmath18 detection and for studying inflationary physics , which we report in   [ sec : conclusions ] . in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we also draw some conclusions on the constraints that can be applied to inflationary models based on the capabilities of these experiments .",
    "as @xcite and @xcite demonstrate , a wide class of phenomenological inflation models are compatible with the current cmb data . in the absence of specific knowledge of the fundamental physics underlying inflation ,",
    "an important consideration is therefore to see what general statements one can make about inflation from various types of measurements .",
    "it is well - known ( e.g. @xcite ) that a measurement of the amplitude of the tensor modes immediately fixes the value of the hubble parameter @xmath19 during inflation when the relevant scales are leaving the horizon , or equivalently , the potential of the scalar field driving inflation ( the _ inflaton _ ) and its first derivative , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the relations between these quantities are given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the reduced planck energy , @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the power spectra of the primordial tensor and curvature perturbations defined at the fiducial wavenumber @xmath27 mpc@xmath28 , where the scalar amplitude @xmath29 is also defined , following the notational convention of @xcite .    a measurement of the spectral index of the scalar ( density ) perturbations fixes @xmath30 , and a potential measurement of the running of the scalar spectral index carries information about the third derivative of the potential , @xmath31 .",
    "further , combining a measurement of the spectral index of tensor perturbations , @xmath32 , with the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath17 allows one to test the _ inflationary consistency condition _ , @xmath33 , that single - field slow roll models must satisfy .",
    "however , a precise determination of the tensor spectral index is likely to be even more difficult than a measurement of the tensor amplitude .",
    "the current constraint on the tensor - to - scalar ratio at 95% significance from wmap data alone gives the energy scale of slow - roll inflation as @xcite : @xmath34 this is the familiar result that a significant contribution of tensor modes to the cmb requires that inflation takes places at a high energy scale . if instead of using cmb only data we use the most stringent constraints to date on @xmath17 , a 95% upper limit of @xmath35 , obtained from a compilation of current cmb plus large scale structure data @xcite , one obtains @xmath36 or equivalently , @xmath37 .",
    "several authors ( e.g. @xcite ) have discussed the physical implications of a measurement of primordial @xmath13-mode polarization .",
    "one can take the point of view that the inflaton @xmath38 is a fundamental field and assume the techniques of effective field theory , for which the heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out , to be a correct description of the physics of inflation . in this case",
    ", the effective inflaton potential can be expanded in non - renormalizable operators suppressed by some higher energy scale , for example the planck mass : @xmath39 for the series expansion for the effective potential to be convergent in general and the effective theory to be self - consistent , it is required that @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite showed that the _ width _ of the potential ( i.e. the distance traversed by the inflaton during inflation ) @xmath41 , can also be related to @xmath17 .",
    "the change in the inflaton field during the @xmath42 e - folds when the scales corresponding to @xmath43 are leaving the horizon is @xmath44 according to this bound , high values of @xmath17 require changes in @xmath45 to be of the order of @xmath46 ; this is in fact only a lower bound , since at least 50 - 60 e - folds are required before inflation ends ( e.g. @xcite ) , meaning that over the course of inflation , @xmath47 could exceed the bound in eq .",
    "[ eq : lythbound ] by an order of magnitude . for the present discussion ,",
    "the important point is that for a tensor - to - scalar ratio of order 0.1 , the field must travel a distance @xmath48 over the course of inflation , so that the effective field theory description in eq .  [ eq : effptl ] must break down at some point during inflation .",
    "this fact has been used to argue , based on self - consistency , that a very small tensor / scalar ratio is expected in a realistic inflationary universe , leading to the discouraging conclusion that the primordial @xmath13-modes in the cmb would be unobservably small .",
    "however , arguments based on effective field theory are not the only way to study the dynamics of inflation .",
    "the inflaton may not be a fundamental scalar field ; in fact , as we discuss later in   [ sec : conclusions : inf ] , advances are being made building `` natural '' particle physics - motivated inflationary models based on approximate shift symmetries and extra - dimensional setups .",
    "also , one can take the approach that , for the predictions of single - field inflation to be valid , the only requirement is that the evolution of spacetime is governed by a single order parameter . in this approach , one can reformulate the exact dynamical equations for inflation as an infinite hierarchy of flow equations described by the generalized `` hubble slow roll '' ( hsr ) parameters @xcite . in the hamilton - jacobi formulation of inflationary dynamics",
    ", one expresses the hubble parameter directly as a function of the field @xmath38 rather than a function of time , @xmath49 , under the assumption that @xmath38 is monotonic in time .",
    "then the equations of motion for the field and background are given by : @xmath50 ^ 2 - \\frac{3}{2\\mpl^2}h^2(\\phi)&=&-\\frac{1}{2\\mpl^4}v(\\phi ) .",
    "\\label{eq : hj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , prime denotes derivatives with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : hj ] ) , referred to as the _ hamilton - jacobi equation _ , allows us to consider inflation in terms of @xmath51 rather than @xmath52 .",
    "the former , being a geometric quantity , describes inflation more naturally .",
    "this picture has the major advantage that it allows us to remove the field from the dynamical picture altogether , and study the generic behavior of slow roll inflation without making assumptions about the underlying particle physics ( although the underlying assumption of a single order parameter is still present ) . in terms of the hsr parameters",
    "@xmath53 , the dynamics of inflation is described by the infinite hierarchy @xmath54 the flow equations allow us to consider the model space spanned by inflation using monte - carlo techniques .",
    "since the dynamics are governed by a set of first - order differential equations , one can specify the entire cosmological evolution by choosing values for the slow - roll parameters @xmath53 , which completely specifies the inflationary model .",
    "note , however , two caveats : first , in practice one has to truncate the infinite hierarchy at some finite order ; in this paper we retain terms up to 10th order .",
    "secondly , the choice of slow roll parameters for the monte - carlo process necessitates the assumption of some priors for the ranges of values taken by the @xmath53 . in the absence of any",
    "_ a priori _ theoretical knowledge about these priors , one can assume flat priors with some ranges dictated by current observational limits , and the requirement that the potential satisfies the slow - roll conditions . changing this `` initial metric '' of slow - roll parameters _ changes _ the clustering of phase points on the resulting observational plane of a given monte - carlo simulation .",
    "thus , _ the results from these simulations can not be interpreted in a statistical way_.    nevertheless , important conclusions can be drawn from the results of such simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) ; they show that models do not cover the observable parameter space uniformly , but instead cluster around certain attractor regions . and",
    "these regions do not correspond especially closely to the expectations from effective field theory ; they show significant concentrations of points with significant tensor / scalar ratio .",
    "recent work by @xcite shows that , in the inflationary flow picture , there is no well - defined relation of the form eq .  [",
    "eq : lythbound ] .",
    "however , a reformulation of the bound in eq .  [ eq : lythbound ] is found if one imposes observational constraints on the scalar spectral index @xmath55 and its running with scale @xmath56 .",
    "the precise values and error bars on these parameters depend on the particular data set ( or combinations of data sets ) used in the parameter estimation , and some data sets yield cleaner and more reliable determinations than others @xcite . nevertheless , for our purposes we shall use the tightest constraints available at present .",
    "these come from a compilation of cmb data , and large scale structure data from galaxy surveys and lyman-@xmath57 forest lines ( e.g. @xcite ) : at 95% confidence these limits are @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    here",
    "we illustrate how an empirical relation between @xmath47 and @xmath17 can be found and show that this relation is somewhat insensitive to the priors on the @xmath60 parameters .",
    "figures [ fig.lythboundwmap ] and [ fig.lythboundalldata ] show the absolute value of @xmath41 over the final 55 e - folds of inflation , plotted against the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath17 .",
    "[ fig.lythboundwmap ] shows a 2-million point monte - carlo simulation of the flow equations , allowing the fourth slow roll parameter , @xmath61 , to have a wide prior @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "this prior on @xmath61 has been ( arbitrarily ) set to have the same width as the bound on @xmath63 allowed by the wmap data @xcite .",
    "a wide prior is also allowed on the higher order hsr parameters . in the simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.lythboundalldata ] , the width of the prior on @xmath61 has been decreased by a factor of five , @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "the higher order hsr parameters also have a narrower prior than the previous case .",
    "these choices are motivated by the prejudice that higher - order parameters in the expansion should have narrower priors around zero , and by the fact that tighter constraints on @xmath63 are possible from cmb and large - scale structure data compilations or future higher - precision cmb data .    as was emphasized earlier ,",
    "the top panels of these figures show that the clustering of points in the two cases is different due to the different initial distributions allowed .",
    "the bottom panels show the remaining points after the observational constraints from the above compilation of cmb and large scale structure have been applied .",
    "it is seen that with this prior in phase - space , there is now a fairly well - defined relation between @xmath47 and @xmath17 , and that even though the distributions in the two simulations with initial priors of different width are different , this relationship is roughly the same in both cases . as reported in @xcite , this reformulation of the bound in eq .",

    "[ eq : lythflow ] is so steep that , to probe models with small field variations where an effective field theory description is likely to be valid , one needs to be able to detect @xmath68 .",
    "conversely , a detection of a larger tensor component would support a large - field model for inflation .",
    "note that the discussion and the bound stated in eq .",
    "[ eq : lythflow ] apply to non - hybrid models , plotted as dots .",
    "figures [ fig.lythboundwmap ] and [ fig.lythboundalldata ] also show monte - carlo simulations which qualify as hybrid inflation models ( e.g. @xcite ) , plotted as stars .",
    "these indeed show a few small - field models which have significant values of @xmath17 .",
    "however , it must be noted that these models inflate forever till inflation is suddenly ended at some critical time by a second field ; the observables for the monte - carlo simulations for models in this class have been computed arbitrarily at 400 e - folds before the end of inflation for the purposes of these figures - observables computed at a different time during inflation would obviously yield different results .",
    "if a value of @xmath69 is detected , hybrid models can be easily distinguished from large - field models by looking at the scalar spectral index : large - field models predict a red spectral index while hybrid models predict a blue index .",

    "@xmath87 is the number of detectors and @xmath88 the integration time per pixel . with these conventions",

    "this limit can be overcome by using multiple detectors ; for example quiet and polarbear will have of the order of @xmath98 detectors .",
    "assuming that cmb multipoles are gaussian - distributed , the likelihood function for an ideal , noiseless , full sky experiment can be written as @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the estimator for the measured angular power spectrum .",

    "the details of the mode - correlation depend on the specific details of the mask , but for @xmath109 greater than the characteristic size of the survey our approximation should hold .",
    "the expression for the likelihood ( [ eq : like_real ] ) is only valid for a single frequency experiment .",
    "the exact expression for multi - frequency experiments which takes into account for both auto- and cross- channels power spectra can not be written in a straightforward manner in this form . however , for @xmath110 frequencies with the same noise level , considering both auto and cross power spectra is equivalent to having one effective frequency with an effective noise power spectrum lower by a factor @xmath110 .",
    "this can be understood in two ways .",
    "if one were to combine @xmath110 independent maps , the resulting map will have a noise level lower by a factor @xmath111 ; thus the noise power spectrum will be that of an auto - power spectrum , reduced by a factor @xmath112 .",
    "one could instead compute auto and cross @xmath113 and then combine them in an minimum variance fashion .",
    "let us assume gaussianity for simplicity .",

    "the minimum variance combination will thus yield an effective noise power spectrum of @xmath125 .",
    "we can generalize the above considerations to the case where the different channels have different noise levels .",
    "this is useful for example in the case where each channel has a different residual foreground level , which , as we will show below , can be approximated as a white noise contribution in addition to the instrumental noise .",

    ", the value of @xmath17 is obtained via a bayesian maximum likelihood analysis , and the cosmic variance contribution for non - zero @xmath17 is included in the error calculation . since a measurement of @xmath17",
    "is needed to constrain inflationary models , here we follow the second approach .",
    "thus we do not report the minimum value of @xmath17 that can be distinguished from zero , but error - bars for several fiducial @xmath17 values .",
    "as anticipated in the introduction , foregrounds are one of the main obstacles to the detection and measurement of primordial @xmath13-modes : they are likely to dominate the signal at all frequencies . and , while foreground intensities are relatively well known , polarized foregrounds are not .",
    "here we will neglect the effect of foregrounds on the cmb temperature , as foreground contamination in the temperature data at the angular scales considered is much smaller than the contamination to the polarized signal and foreground cleaning is expected to leaves a negligible contribution in the temperature signal @xcite .",
    "cmb polarized foregrounds arise due to free - free , synchrotron , and dust emission , as well as due to extra - galactic sources such as radio sources and dusty galaxies . here",
    ", we will consider only synchrotron and dust emission ; in fact , free - free emission is expected to be negligibly polarized , and the radio source contribution remaining after masking the sky for all sources brighter than @xmath1971 jy is always well below other foregrounds at large angular scales .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) find that this residual point source contribution is @xmath198% of the other foregrounds in the power for @xmath199 .",
    "note , however , that at @xmath200 , this contribution that we neglect can be as important in the bb power spectrum as the lensing signal ( see @xcite ) , and therefore can seriously hinder the delensing implementation .",
    "we also neglect the contribution from dusty galaxies .",
    "free electrons spiral around the galactic magnetic field lines and emit synchrotron radiation .",
    "this emission can be up to 75% polarized , and is the main cmb foreground at low frequencies .",
    "we model the power spectrum of synchrotron as ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath201 where we have assumed that galactic synchrotron emission has the same amplitude for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the unpolarized synchrotron intensity has @xmath202 with variations across the sky of about @xmath203 ( e.g. @xcite ) and @xmath204 ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) with variation across the sky .",
    "information on polarized synchrotron is limited at present to frequencies much lower than cmb frequencies ( e.g. @xcite and mostly low galactic latitudes ) .",
    "recent estimates for @xmath205 for polarized synchrotron emission @xcite show spatial and frequency variations .",
    "for example , @xcite study the angular power spectrum of polarized galactic synchrotron at several frequencies below 3 ghz and at several galactic latitudes , and find a wide variation mostly due to faraday rotation and variations in the local properties of the foregrounds .",
    "@xcite find that at high galactic latitudes there is no significant dependence of the slope on frequency . here",
    "we consider @xmath206 for both @xmath12 and @xmath13 , consistent with e.g. @xcite .",
    "we take the reference frequency of @xmath207 ghz and the reference multipole @xmath208 so that we can use the dasi 95% upper limit @xcite of 0.91 @xmath209k@xmath210 to set the amplitude @xmath211 .",
    "since the normalization is set at @xmath212 and most of the @xmath17 signal is at @xmath213 , a choice of a flatter @xmath205 would have the effect of reducing the synchrotron contamination at low @xmath109 .",
    "we will consider three cases : an amplitude equal to the dasi limit ( pessimistic case ) and half of that amplitude ( reasonable case ) .",
    "recent results by @xcite show a detection of synchrotron polarized emission in a clean area of the sky at 2.3 ghz .",
    "the amplitude of this signal is about an order of magnitude below the dasi upper limit .",
    "we will consider this amplitude ( 10% of the dasi limit ) as a minimum amplitude ( optimistic case ) achievable only for partial sky experiments which can look at a clean patch of the sky .",
    "unless otherwise stated we will assume the pessimistic case .",
    "we ignore a possible anomalous dust contribution ( e.g. @xcite ) as it is important only at frequencies below 35 ghz or so @xcite . we model the dust signal as : @xmath214 ^ 2 \\label{eq : dustcl}\\ ] ] assuming the temperature of the dust grains to be constant across the sky , @xmath215k .",
    "we take @xmath216 @xcite , and set our reference frequency to be @xmath217 ghz .",
    "the amplitude @xmath218 is given by the intensity normalization of @xcite , extrapolated to @xmath219 ghz , and @xmath220 is the polarization fraction . since we want to use the archeops upper limit for the diffuse dust component @xcite of @xmath221 5% at @xmath222 ( roughly corresponding to the resolution in @xcite ) , we set @xmath223 .",
    "archeops finds @xmath224 ; with our choice the extrapolation of the dust contribution at higher frequency is slightly more conservative . since a weak galactic magnetic field of 3",
    "@xmath209 g already gives a 1% @xcite polarization , the polarization fraction should be bound to be between 15% .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will assume a 5% polarization fraction .",
    "for @xmath225 we follow @xcite : @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 ( in agreement with the measurement of starlight polarization of @xcite ) .    as parameters like @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 and @xmath220",
    "may show spatial variations , the optimal frequency band may be different for full sky and partial sky experiments and may vary between different patches of the sky .",
    "the foreground treatment presented above is quite simplistic and can not capture the foreground properties completely .",
    "however , we will not be using these estimates to subtract the foreground from the signal .",
    "instead , we assume that foreground subtraction can be done correctly down to a given level ( e.g. 1% , 10% ) , and use these foreground models to propagate the effects of foreground subtraction residuals into the resulting error - bars for the cosmological parameters . in other words the modeling enters in the error - bars , not in the signal",
    ". therefore , as long as the foreground assumptions are reasonable , and foregrounds can be subtracted at the assumed level , the results are relatively insensitive to the details of the foreground model .",
    "of course , one can not know in advance whether the foreground will be subtracted at that level .",
    "for this reason we considered several different options ( 10% , 1% etc .. ) .    to propagate foreground subtraction errors we proceed as follows .",
    "we assume that foregrounds are subtracted from the maps via foreground templates or using multi - frequency information with techniques such as mems ( e.g. @xcite ) , ica @xcite .",
    "we write the effect on the power spectrum of the residual galactic contamination as an additional `` noise - like '' component @xmath234 composed by a term proportional to the foreground @xmath113 and a noise term : @xmath235 where @xmath236 denotes dust ( d ) or synchrotron ( s ) , @xmath237 denotes the average value of the spectral index , and @xmath238 quantifies how good the foreground subtraction is ( e.g. @xmath238=0.01 for a 1% residual in the @xmath113 ) .",
    "@xmath239 is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : syncl ] for synchrotron and eq .",
    "[ eq : dustcl ] for dust ; @xmath240 denotes the noise power spectrum of the template map . as an estimate",
    ", we assume that the noise spectrum in the template maps is a white noise equal to the noise spectrum of one of the channels reduced by a factor @xmath241 .",
    "the factor of 1/2 arises from the fact that foreground templates are effectively obtained by subtracting maps at two different frequencies ( which increases the noise in the map by a factor @xmath242 ) , and that there are @xmath243 map pairs .",
    "although the map pairs are not all independent , we expect that experiments will have some channels both at higher and lower frequencies than those devoted to cosmology , to be used for foreground studies .",
    "we thus consider this a reasonable estimate for the template noise .",
    "@xmath244 denotes the frequency at which the template is created . for this forecast",
    "we assume that @xmath244 coincides with the frequency of the experiment channel where the foreground contamination is highest . to justify the _ ansatz _",
    "( [ eq : clres ] ) , consider the result from @xcite ( their  3 and appendix ) .",
    "@xmath245 where @xmath246 denotes the power spectrum of the spectral index error .",
    "if the power spectrum of the spectral index error has the same @xmath109 dependence as the total intensity power ( that is @xmath247 for synchrotron and @xmath248 for dust ) , neglecting the logarithmic dependence on @xmath249 we obtain eq .",
    "[ eq : clres ] .",
    "we assume that the foreground template is computed for the `` cosmological '' frequency where the foreground contamination is highest .",
    "for example , for 5 different frequency bands at ( @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 , @xmath254 ghz ) , the synchrotron template will be computed for the @xmath250 ghz band and the dust template for the @xmath254 ghz band .",
    "several different techniques to reconstruct the gravitational lensing potential from cmb data and reduce or remove lensing contamination to the @xmath18 signal have been proposed @xcite . however , in presence of instrumental noise the contamination can not be easily removed .",
    "in addition foreground emission is expected to be highly non - gaussian and the performance of delensing techniques have not been explored in the presence of non - gaussian foregrounds .",
    "in fact , the separation of the primordial gravitational wave contribution is achieved exploiting the non - gaussianity of the lensed cmb .",
    "thus , the non - gaussian nature of the foregrounds will degrade this reconstruction and limit the delensing performance . to include the above considerations , forecast whether delensing can successfully be implemented and can improve constraints on @xmath17 we proceed as follows .",
    "if foregrounds are neglected , we assume that the delensing technique can be applied only in the signal - dominated regime , and that in this regime the procedure can reduce the bb - lensing signal only down to the level of the instrumental noise power spectrum . this assumption is well motivated by results of e.g. , @xcite .",
    "when including foregrounds , we assume that delensing can be implemented only if the @xmath18 power spectrum of the combination of foreground emission and foreground template noise is below 10% of the @xmath18 lensing power spectrum , and that the @xmath18-lensing signal can be reduced only down to 10% of the foreground signal ( emission plus template noise ) .",
    "we deem this to be a reasonable assumption : a percent level of foreground contamination in the angular power spectrum is probably close to the minimum achievable and it corresponds to a 10% level in the maps",
    ". the residual foreground will be highly non - gaussian thus limiting the delensing to this level . when considering a realistic case with noise and foregrounds , for every @xmath109 we consider whichever effect is most important .",
    "we consider several different experimental settings .",
    "first an ideal experiment ( ideal ) , then a more realistic full - sky satellite experiment ( satel ) and finally , ground - based and balloon - born partial sky experiments .",
    "for all these cases , we compute the marginalized errors on the parameters using the fisher matrix approach illustrated above . in the main text of the paper",
    "we report errors for the parameters relevant for inflation and parameters degenerate with these ( i.e. @xmath17 , @xmath154 , @xmath32 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 ) . the errors on the other cosmological parameters are reported in the appendix . for each case",
    "we start by considering ten cosmological parameters ( @xmath17 , @xmath154 , @xmath32 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath255 @xmath256 , @xmath93 , @xmath257 and @xmath155 ) .",
    "we do not consider calibration uncertainties , even though they propagate into the error on the amplitude .",
    "as exploring non - flat models is computationally expensive when we find that @xmath258 is only degenerate with @xmath93 , we impose flatness ( flt ) . this constraint does not affect the estimated error on the remaining cosmological parameters . finally , we report errors obtained with and without imposing the consistency relation ( @xmath145 , cr ) .",
    "let us consider an ideal experiment , covering the full sky , with no instrumental noise and no foregrounds .",
    "we consider @xmath259=1500 because smaller angular scales will be observed from the ground and , most importantly , because higher multipoles in the temperature are affected by secondary effects while in the polarization @xmath260 does not add significant cosmological information .    since @xcite showed that the lensing contribution to the @xmath18 spectra can be greatly reduced and , in the absence of instrumental noise and foregrounds , completely eliminated , we consider two cases : the @xmath18 spectrum with lensing ( l ) and without ( nl ) ( i.e. with the lensing contribution perfectly subtracted out ) .",
    "we report the results in table table  [ table : rfull ] in the l case , due to the lensing contamination , the same error can be achieved by considering only @xmath261 for @xmath18 .",
    "errors on other relevant cosmological parameters are reported in table [ table : rfull ] .",
    "we find that @xmath17 is mainly degenerate with @xmath32 ; by fixing @xmath32 , the error on @xmath17 is greatly reduced ( see table [ table : rntfixed ] ) , but the errors on the other cosmological parameters do not change significantly ."
