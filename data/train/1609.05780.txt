    "quantum computer is a device that operates on a finite dimensional quantum system @xmath14 consisting of @xmath15 _ qudits _ @xcite that are described by a @xmath16-dimensional hilbert spaces , @xmath17 @xcite . when @xmath18 qudits are typically called qubits .",
    "the ability to effectively manufacture optical gates operating on many modes , using for example optical networks that couple modes of light @xcite , is a natural motivation to consider not only qubits but also higher dimensional systems in quantum computation setting ( see also @xcite for the case of fermionic linear optics ) .",
    "one of the necessary ingredients for a quantum computer to work properly is the ability to perform arbitrary unitary operation on the system @xmath19 .",
    "we distinguish two types of operations .",
    "first are one - qudit operations ( one - qudit gates ) that belong to @xmath20 and act on a single qudit .",
    "the second are @xmath21-qudit operations ( @xmath21-qudit gates ) , @xmath22 , that belong to @xmath23 and act on the chosen @xmath21 qudits .",
    "a @xmath21-qudit gate is nontrivial if it is not a tensor product of @xmath21 single qudit gates .",
    "we say that one - qudit gates @xmath24 are _ universal _ if any gate from @xmath25 can be built , with an arbitrary precision , using gates from @xmath3 .",
    "mathematically this means that the set @xmath26 generated by elements from @xmath27 is dense in @xmath25 and its closure is the whole @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "it is known that once we have access to a universal set of one - qudit gates together with one additional two - qudit gate that does not map separable states onto separable states we can build , within a given precision , an arbitrary unitary gate belonging to @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "thus in order to characterise universal sets of gates for quantum computing with qudits one needs to characterise sets that are universal for one qudit .",
    "although there are some qualitative characterisations of universal one - qudit gates the full understanding is far from complete .",
    "it is known , for example , that almost all sets of qudit gates are universal , i.e universal sets @xmath3 of the given cardinality @xmath30 form a zariski open set in @xmath31 . by the definition of a zariski open set we can therefore deduce that non - universal gates can be characterised by vanishing of a finite number of polynomials in the gates entries and their conjugates @xcite .",
    "these polynomials are , however , not known and it is hard to find operationally simple criteria that decide one - qudit gates universality .",
    "some special cases of two and three dimensional gates have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the main obstruction in these approaches is the lack of classification of finite and infinite disconnected subgroups of @xmath25 for @xmath32 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide some reasonable criteria for universality of one - qudit gates that can be applied even if one does not know classification of finite / infinite disconnected subgroups of @xmath25 . to achieve this we divide the problem into two .",
    "first , using the fact that considered gates @xmath33 belong to groups that are compact simple lie groups @xmath2 , we provide a criterion which allows to decide if an infinite subgroup is the whole group @xmath2 .",
    "it is formulated in terms of adjoint representation matrices @xmath34 , @xmath35 and boils down to finding a dimension of the kernel of a matrix , whose coefficients are polynomial in the entries of gates and their complex conjugates .",
    "as the considered groups are compact and connected , any gate @xmath36 can be written as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an element of the lie algebra of the group .",
    "thus for a given set of gates @xmath27 we also have a corresponding set of lie algebra elements @xmath39 .",
    "these elements can be treated as hamiltonians .",
    "a set of hamiltonians is universal iff the lie algebra generated by its elements is the whole lie algebra @xcite . using the adjoint representation ,",
    "this time in the setting of lie algebras , we provide criteria for the universality of @xmath39 and show when they overlap with the criteria for the universality of @xmath27 .",
    "next , we give sufficient conditions for a set generated by @xmath27 to be infinite .",
    "they stem from inequalities that relate the distances of group elements and their commutators from the identity @xcite .",
    "in particular we show that for a pair of gates @xmath40 and @xmath41 , for which the hilbert - schmidt distances from the centre @xmath42 of @xmath2 are less than @xmath43 and such that @xmath44_\\bullet:=g_1g_2g_1^{-1}g_2^{-1}\\notin z(g)$ ] , deciding universality boils down to checking if the corresponding lie algebra elements generate the whole lie algebra .",
    "next we show that for a gate whose distance from @xmath42 is larger that @xmath43 , @xmath45 , there is always @xmath46 such that @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , using dirichlet approximation theorems ( and their modifications ) we give an upper bound for the maximal @xmath48 such , that for every @xmath8 we have @xmath47 for some @xmath49 .",
    "we note , however , that the commutator of @xmath50_\\bullet$ ] might belong to @xmath42 even if @xmath44\\notin z(g)$ ] .",
    "thus we next show that if the spectra of the adjoint representation matrices @xmath51 and @xmath52 satisfy certain conditions , then @xmath50_\\bullet\\notin z(g)$ ] .",
    "gates that do not satisfy these conditions are called _ exceptional _ and we outline the procedure which leads to deciding their universality .    the last part of the paper concerns applications of the above ideas to @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in particular we give a full characterisation of the universal pairs of single qubit gates . as we show , in this case exceptional spectra are in direct correspondence with the characters of the finite subgroups of @xmath9 .",
    "we also characterise real and complex @xmath53-mode beamsplitters that are universal when acting on @xmath54 modes . our approach allows to reproof the results of @xcite without the knowledge of disconnected infinite or finite subgroups of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "a nonabelian lie algebra @xmath5 is simple if @xmath65 has no ideals other than @xmath66 and @xmath5 .",

    "@xmath71 s are ideals of @xmath65 .",
    "the algebras we will be interested in belong to a special class of either simple lie algebras or their direct sums . in the following we briefly discuss their properties .    a representation of a real lie algebra on a real vector space is a linear map @xmath72 that satisfies @xmath73\\right)=\\left[\\phi(x),\\phi(y)\\right]$ ] . a representation is called _ irreducible _ if @xmath74 has no @xmath75-invariant subspace @xmath76 , i.e. a subspace for which @xmath77 , for all @xmath78 .",
    "irreducible representations are characterised by the schur lemma that says a representation @xmath72 is irreducible if and only if the only endomorphism that commutes with all @xmath79 is proportional to the identity . as @xmath5 is a real vector space itself one can consider representation of @xmath5 on @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , there exists a canonical representation of this type that is called the _ adjoint representation _ : @xmath80.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] note that invariant spaces of the adjoint representation are ideals and therefore the adjoint representation of a simple algebra is irreducible . using the adjoint representation",

    "a result @xmath96 is a direct sum of ideals .",
    "we can repeat this procedure for @xmath97 and @xmath98 and after several steps finally we get    a real compact semisimple lie algebra is a direct sum of real compact simple lie algebras .",
    "let us next choose a basis @xmath99 in @xmath65 that satisfies @xmath100 . in this basis @xmath101 is an antisymmetric trace zero real matrix , hence an element of the special orthogonal lie algebra @xmath102 .",
    "finally we remark that the subalgebra of a simple or semisimple lie algebra need not to be simple / semisimple .",
    "a lie group @xmath2 is a group that has a structure of a differential manifold and the group operation is smooth .",
    "we say @xmath2 is compact if it is a compact manifold , i.e. any open covering of @xmath2 has a finite subcovering .",
    "it is well known that a closed subgroup of a lie group is a lie group @xcite . in this page",
    "we will always consider closed subgroups . an important class of subgroups are normal subgroups .",

    "the quotient @xmath106 is a group .",
    "a disconnected @xmath2 consists of connected components . connected components of a lie group are open and their number is finite if @xmath2 is compact , as otherwise they would constitute an open covering of @xmath2 that does not possess finite subcovering .",
    "the identity component @xmath107 , i.e. the component that contains the neutral element @xmath108 , is a normal subgroup of @xmath2 .",

    "components group_.    the connection between lie groups and lie algebras is established in the following way",
    ". left invariant vector fields on @xmath2 together with vector fields commutator form the lie algebra @xmath65 of a lie group @xmath2 .",
    "note that these fields are determined by their value at @xmath108 and therefore @xmath65 can be identified with the tangent space to @xmath2 at @xmath108 , i.e @xmath114 .",
    "for every @xmath78 there is a unique one parameter subgroup @xmath115 whose tangent vector @xmath108 is @xmath38 .",
    "we define the exponential map @xmath116 to be : @xmath117 . for any lie group the image of the exponential map , @xmath118 ,",
    "is contained in the identity component @xmath107 and when @xmath2 is compact @xmath119 .",
    "therefore for a compact and connected group every element @xmath8 is of the form @xmath120 for some @xmath121 . for matrix lie groups",
    "@xmath122 these definitions simplify as the exponential map is the matrix exponential that is defined by @xmath123 and the lie algebra is defined as @xmath124 .",
    "a compact connected lie group is simple / semisimple if its lie algebra is compact and simple/ semisimple .",
    "recall that the lie algebra @xmath125 of the identity component of @xmath105 is an ideal of the lie algebra @xmath5 .",
    "we can also use equivalent definition that says a compact connected group @xmath2 is simple if it has no connected normal subgroups . similarly as for lie algebras , compact semisimple lie groups have a particularly nice structure .",
    "let g be a compact connected semisimple group .",
    "then @xmath126 , where each @xmath127 is a simple compact group and @xmath128 is contained in the centre of @xmath129 .",
    "a representation of a lie group on a real vector space is a homomorphism @xmath130 , i.e. @xmath131 satisfies @xmath132 .",
    "a particularly important example is the adjoint representation of @xmath2 on @xmath5.@xmath133 the image of @xmath134 is @xmath135 , where @xmath42 is the centre of @xmath2 . for a semisimple compact lie group @xmath42",
    "is finite by definition and therefore @xmath136 is a finite covering homomorphism onto @xmath137 . for a compact connected simple lie groups",
    "the adjoint representation is irreducible .",
    "the relation between the adjoint representations of a compact connected semisimple lie group and its lie algebra , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , follows from the fact that @xmath138 is a smooth homomorphism . for any @xmath78 and all @xmath140 elements @xmath141 form a one - parameter subgroup in @xmath142",
    "whose tangent vector at @xmath143 is @xmath82 .",
    "as this group is uniquely determined by its tangent vector we have @xmath144 . using this relation",
    "we easily see that the killing form on @xmath65 is invariant with respect to the adjoint action , i.e @xmath145 .",

    "let @xmath2 be a lie group .",
    "we say that @xmath103 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath2 if there is an open cover of @xmath148 such that every open set in this cover contains exactly one element from @xmath148 - we will call it a _ discrete open cover _ of @xmath148 .",
    "if @xmath2 is compact every discrete subgroup is finite . to see this ,",
    "assume that there is an infinite discrete subgroup @xmath148 in a compact @xmath2 and take the open cover of @xmath2 that is a union of discrete open cover of @xmath148 and the open set which consists of elements not in this discrete cover .",
