    "annihilation of positrons near the galactic center gives rise to a narrow 511 kev gamma ray line that was first observed in 1972 @xcite , and which has been confirmed by numerous experiments since then , most recently by the spi spectrometer aboard the integral satellite @xcite .",
    "the signal has two distinct components , one associated with the central region of the galaxy ( bulge ) and another with the disk .",
    "there is as yet no consensus as to a conventional astrophysical origin for these gamma rays @xcite , which evidently originate from excess positrons annihilating nearly at rest .",
    "the apparent axial symmetry of the bulge component is a point in favor for proposals of models of dark matter ( dm ) that decays or annihilates into low - energy positrons , since dm should be distributed symmetrically near the galactic center .",
    "however early proposals of this sort were driven toward dm candidates that were nearly as light as the electron itself @xcite , since the injection energy of the positrons can be no greater than a few mev @xcite ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "models of mev scale dark matter that couples to @xmath2 are highly constrained by low energy collider data , and are not ( in our opinion ) theoretically attractive . if dark matter is the source of 511 kev gamma rays , one will need to verify its properties by direct detection or other complementary means to make the explanation of the 511 kev signal convincing .",
    "= 0.5    in this work we propose and revisit scenarios in which a long - lived excited state of dm with mass at the 10 gev scale can scatter into a nearby unstable state , whose mass differs by only a few kev .",
    "the unstable state decays into the ground state with the emission of a low - energy @xmath3 pair .",
    "the decay can be relatively fast , but the energy is only released after the slow process of inelastic dm - dm collisions occurs .",
    "( see however the purely decaying variant described below . )",
    "there are two qualitatively different ways to realize this , depending upon whether the metastable state is the middle one , requiring endothermic scattering , or the top one , leading to exothermic . the mass spectra and sequence of transitions are sketched in figure [ spect ] . the endothermic version , in the context of 500 - 1000 gev dm ,",
    "was first presented in @xcite to try to simultaneously explain integral , pamela ( payload for antimatter matter exploration and light - nuclei astrophysics ) @xcite and atic ( advanced thin ionization calorimeter ) @xcite excess electron observations .",
    "it was subsequently discussed with applications to direct dm detection in @xcite , for @xmath4 kev values of the small mass splitting .",
    "the viability of the scenario for integral was further explored in @xcite , but only in the heavy dm regime .",
    "mev mass gap must occur in galactic inelastic collisions @xcite .",
    "however more detailed computations showed that the collision rate is not high enough with such a large energy barrier to overcome @xcite . ]",
    "it would clearly be interesting if the dm mechanism for the integral observations was somehow tied to direct detection of the dm @xcite .",
    "our exothermic mechanism is partly motivated by ref .",
    "@xcite , which proposed a model involving only the states @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( in our notation ) , as a means of explaining two indications of direct detection of dark matter , namely the long - standing dama / libra annual modulation @xcite , and the more recent observation of excess low - recoil events by the cogent ( coherent germanium neutrino technology ) experiment @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite showed that dm with a mass of @xmath7 gev and mass splitting of a few kev could be consistent with these observations , using the exothermic nuclear scattering @xmath8 .",
    "their observation is that the shape of recoil spectrum is sensitive to modulations of the local dm velocity when the scattering is exothermic , and this can explain the dama observations .",
    "additionally the overall rate for the same parameters is correct for explaining the excess cogent events .",
    "the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite is related to the inelastic dark matter proposal @xcite , which however assumed the scatterings to be endothermic rather than exothermic .",
    "( see @xcite for another discussion of exothermic scatterings . )",
    "there have been several proposals for dm in the 5 - 10 gev mass range to explain the dama and cogent observations @xcite .",
    "most recently , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that elastic dm interactions could simultaneously explain the dama / libra and cogent observations if the dark matter mass is near 7 gev and the cross section on nucleons around @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "we will argue that our endothermic scenario is close enough to being elastic , if the small mass splitting @xmath11 is of order a few kev , so that the same analysis applies .",
    "even though such a small splitting has little effect on dm - nucleus scattering , it is important for dm - dm scattering in the galaxy , in the present case where the dm is lighter than the nuclei in the direct detectors .",
    "getting the observed rate of galactic positrons limits the maximum mass splitting in this case , to values somewhat lower than those that would strongly affect the direct detection rates .",
    "=    an interesting variant of the above mechanisms is to assume that the unstable excited state is so long - lived that it still has a relic population in the galaxy , and so does not need to be produced by dm collisions .",
    "this version has more freedom , in that the rate of producing positrons ( via decays into @xmath12 ) does not depend upon the small mass splitting @xmath11 , whereas the rate of inelastic scattering @xmath13 is rather sensitive to @xmath11 .",
    "our proposals fit nicely within the framework of dark matter with a nonabelian gauge symmetry in a hidden sector , as suggested by @xcite , since such dm automatically consists of multiple states , and small mass splittings are radiatively generated if the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the simplest example that contains three dm states is a hidden su(2 ) gauge sector , where the dm is in the triplet representation .",

    "we find that the hidden gauge symmetry should break at the 10 gev scale ( resulting in gauge boson masses of order several hundred mev ) to give the right cross sections for dm scattering in the galactic center and in detectors .",
    "an attractive feature of these hidden sector gauge boson masses and couplings is that they are in the right range to be directly probed by new proposed fixed - target experiments @xcite .",

    ".[alphagfinal ] in the end , corrections due to the initial velocity of the dm particles contribute at the @xmath453 level , while corrections from sommerfeld enhancment contribute only 1 part in @xmath454 due to their additional dependence on @xmath19 ( since the coefficient @xmath150 is of the same order as @xmath135 ) .",
    "in this appendix , we find the freezeout temperature of the dark matter kinetic coupling to the standard model . for convenience calculating phase space factors , we consider downscattering @xmath455 , labeling the @xmath456 momenta as @xmath457 and the initial and final energy and momenta of the sm fermions @xmath388 as @xmath458 and @xmath459 respectively ( similarly for other subscripts ) . here , the relevant initial dm state is @xmath6 for the endothermic case and @xmath5 for exothermic . in this appendix",
    ", we consider the endothermic case , but it should be clear that these results apply equally well in both scenarios . at temperatures under 100 mev ( and , in particular near the important scale of @xmath460 mev ) , only scattering from @xmath461 will be important . furthermore ,",
    "if this process occurs roughly once per hubble time for each of the more massive dm particles , it efficiently maintains the distribution of these two dm states given by the boltzmann factor at the sm temperature .",
    "also , if @xmath149 scattering is still in equilibrium , this reaction can insure that all the dm states maintain a thermal velocity distribution at the sm temperature .",
    "( as we have seen in the main text , @xmath149 scattering typically freezes out later than this process . )",
    "we note that the same calculations apply for scattering between the two top states @xmath462 with the appropriate replacements of @xmath83 , @xmath34 , and @xmath463 .",
    "as shown in figure [ kindec ] , the cross section is only slightly smaller for kev mass splittings .    the matrix element for the scattering process shown in figure [ scatt ] is ( taking electrons for specificity ) = -i |u_1^u_3 |u_f_u_i  .",
    "after the spin sum and average ,        with the replacement @xmath464 , @xmath465 , and @xmath466 , this is also the result for inelastic dm scattering off protons , which is relevant to direct detection experiments .",
    "since we are interested in temperatures much less than the dm mass @xmath22 ( and all other energy scales are also much less than @xmath22 ) , we can work in center - of - momentum ( cm ) frame up to overall errors of order @xmath467 in the cross - section compared to the cosmic rest frame .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath447 , the final electron energy is e_f = e_i+m_13  , or    ranges between @xmath468 and @xmath469 satisfying t_&= & -2|q_i|^2 -2m_13 e_i + & & 2|q_i|^1/2 to lowest order . due to cancellations in ( [ ampsquared ] ) , we will need @xmath151 to the same ( second ) order in small quantities : s = m_^2 + 2m_(m_13 + e_i)+m_13 ^ 2 + 2m_13 e_i+m_e^2 + 2|q_i|^2  .",
    "to lowest order in small quantities , we find ||^2 = 16 [ ampsimple]for the ( spin averaged and summed ) squared amplitude . since @xmath470 and the relative velocity is dominated by the electron velocity , we find that    v_rel =  .[kinxsect ]    we are especially interested in whether the dm and sm can maintain kinetic equilibrium at temperatures @xmath471 , since those temperatures are relevant for @xmath472 downscattering",
    ". then temperatures are parametrically less than @xmath34 , so v_rel & = & ( 2m_e^2+|q_i|^2 + m_13 e_i ) + & & ( m_13 ^ 2 + |q_i|^2 + 2m_13 e_i)^1/2 times corrections of relative order @xmath473 and @xmath474 , where @xmath475 is the cm frame electron speed . at a fixed temperature @xmath192",
    ", we find the total scattering rate by integrating over the fermi - dirac distribution for marginally relativistic electrons ( since @xmath476 ) . assuming a thermal origin for the dark matter abundance so @xmath477 , this total rate can be written in terms of a normalized rate @xmath478 as n_e v_rel ( ) ( m_13 , t )  .in @xmath479 , we include both spin states of electrons and positrons .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath480 considered as a function of @xmath192 inverts to give the dm / sm decoupling temperature as a function of @xmath481 .",
    "this decoupling temperature is shown in figure [ kindec ] for several values of @xmath463 .",
    "since we consider temperatures near the electron mass , we calculate the effective species number @xmath189 numerically .",
    "this includes heating of photons due to @xmath482 annihilation and also the neutrino density .",
    "since the kinetic mixing is between the @xmath483 bosons and sm hypercharge and therefore includes mixing with @xmath484 , we can ask if the dm comes into equilibrium with neutrinos through the weak force . above the electron mass , scattering from electrons will always dominate scattering from neutrinos because @xmath485 ( and because the @xmath486 coupling to the weak current is suppressed by @xmath487 ) @xcite .",
    "however , below the electron mass , there are many more neutrinos than electrons , so neutrino scattering is potentially important . scattering from neutrinos progresses through two feynman diagrams similar to figure [ scatt ] , one with a @xmath150 propagator and one with a @xmath397 propagator , but there is a relative sign between the two in the kinetic mixing .",
    "therefore , to include both diagrams properly , we should replace ^2~ in equation ( [ ampsimple ] ) at low temperatures .",
    "also , taking @xmath242 to be the @xmath150 coupling to the electric current , we should replace @xmath488 .",
    "due to the fact that the two feynman diagrams nearly cancel , the cross - section is highly suppressed .",
    "a straightforward estimate of the total scattering rate and comparison to the hubble rate indicates that @xmath242 would need to be of order @xmath367 for @xmath489 scattering to equilibrate at temperatures below @xmath490 !",
    "in this appendix , we give a careful derivation of the lifetime for @xmath53 decay at one loop level when @xmath491 .",
    "this is the dominant decay process we have been able to find for this case .",
    "consider the loops in figure [ chidecay ] .",
    "as noted above the figure , the two diagrams nearly cancel due to the opposite signs of the nonabelian 3-gauge - boson couplings ; in fact , they do not cancel completely only because the two gauge bosons in the loop have different masses .",
    "the complete amplitude can be written as = ig  , where the spinors of the @xmath419 particles are labeled by their color ( as their momenta @xmath492 will be ) , we take the outgoing momenta of the positron and electron to be @xmath493 respectively , and @xmath494 .",
    "the momenta running counter - clockwise around the loops are @xmath495 on the electron line , @xmath496 on the upper gauge boson line , and @xmath497 on the lower gauge line , where @xmath498 and @xmath499 . with these conventions ,",
    "the loop integrals are      where @xmath500 and we have used @xmath501 . from the second form , it is clear that taking @xmath502 is the same as swapping the feynman parameters @xmath503 .",
    "therefore , the only terms that survive taking the difference in ( [ loop1 ] ) must be antisymmetric in @xmath503 , and these must come from shifting @xmath504 to @xmath505 .",
    "with @xmath506 given as in ( [ feynmanparams ] ) . note that this loop appears to generate an interaction with one extra derivative compared to a magnetic moment operator . in the approximation",
    ", we have taken the gauge boson masses to be much larger than any of the momenta in the denominator .",
    "we also have @xmath507 and @xmath508 , so the amplitude is finally - |u_1u_2 |u_e v_e  , where @xmath400 is the function of @xmath509 in square brackets in ( [ loop2 ] ) .    in the nonrelativistic limit ,",
    "the spin - summed and averaged square amplitude is ||^2 & & ^2 e_+ e_- + & & ( e_+ e_- - p_+ p_- -m_e^2 )  , with @xmath510 and @xmath511 the energy and 3-momentum of the @xmath482 . integrating over the nonrelativistic phase space , we find = ^2_g^2_1 ^ 2_2 ^ 2 ( m_12 - 2m_e)^3 ( m_12-m_e)^2  .using the same estimated parameters as below equation ( [ loopdecay1 ] ) , we find a lifetime of more than @xmath512 s.        j.  kndlseder _ et al .",
