    "the tevatron experiments are searching for the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson which is expected to be the footprint of the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "this mechanism provides an explanation for the masses of the elementary particles , which are massless in the unbroken gauge theory , so experimental confirmation is eagerly awaited for .",
    "direct searches at lep have constrained its mass to be above 114.4 gev  @xcite while indirect searches contrain it to be below 190 gev , when taking into account the direct bound  @xcite .",
    "we report here on the searches at high mass ( defined as the searches in which the higgs boson decays in a pair of @xmath2 ) while the low mass analyses are described in another contribution to this conference  @xcite . for higgs boson searches , at `` high '' mass ( 135 - 200 gev )",
    ", the most sensitive production channel at the tevatron ( center - of - mass energy of @xmath5 ) is the direct production ( @xmath6 ) , but all possible channels are studied to gain sensitivity through their combination , in particular associated higgs - electroweak boson production ( @xmath7 ) .    in this report , we first describe briefly the @xmath8 analyses , which have lower sensitivity at high mass , then report in more details on the  analyses .",
    "we then present the combination of these results with those obtained on searches for low mass higgs and conclude with the prospects on sm higgs boson search at the tevatron .",
    "the search for  relies on the search for two leptons having the same electric charge ( in this report , `` lepton '' refers to electron , @xmath9 , or muon , @xmath10 ) .",
    "no explicit requirements are put on the decay of the third @xmath11 produced , and the like - sign condition ensures orthogonality with the  searches , described below .    at cdf , a new analysis with 1.9 fb@xmath0 has recently been presented  @xcite . for the event selection",
    "the requirements are : at least one electron with @xmath12 20 gev and @xmath13 10 gev or one muon with @xmath13 20 gev , and at least one other electron with @xmath12 6 gev and @xmath13 6 gev or one muon with @xmath13 6 gev .",
    "other lepton selection requirements include isolation , track quality , and the consistency of detector response with expectations for electrons or muons .",
    "photon conversion resulting in electron candidates are rejected by identifying an oppositely charged track satisfying a conversion configuration . for the events containing exactly two leptons passing the lepton selection , the two leptons must originate from the same event vertex , satisfy a di - lepton mass selection of ( @xmath14 12 gev ) and a @xmath15-event veto .",
    "the remaining background can be classified in two types , `` physics '' and `` instrumental '' .",
    "backgrounds containing prompt real leptons ( physics backgrounds ) are estimated using simulated samples .",
    "such backgrounds can be further classified into reducible ( drell - yan , w+heavy flavor hadrons , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ) , and irreducible ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "instrumental backgrounds include residual photon - conversion events which are one of the dominant backgrounds for such like - sign di - lepton analysis .",
    "such background is determined from the data and the simulation  @xcite .",
    "other types of fake lepton events are also an important source of background , for instance the overlap of a charged and a neutral pion , or the misidentification of a charged pion into a muon . their estimation is described in detail in  @xcite . for the final selection",
    "the like - sign di - lepton events are examined on the two dimensional plane of the 2@xmath19 lepton @xmath20 ( pt2 ) vs the di - lepton system @xmath20 ( pt12 ) . in the most sensitive region , pt2 @xmath21 20 gev and pt12 @xmath21 15 gev , 3 events are observed , while 3.2 background events and 0.2 higgs events are expected , if @xmath22 gev .",
    "no significant discrepancies are found between the data and the background expectations and so four regions are selected in this plane from which the limits are extracted and then combined .",
    "the d  collaboration did not update its 2007 result based on 1.1 fb@xmath0 .",
    "the selection was similar to the one described above for the recent cdf result , and the instrumental background is also determined from the data but with a different technique  @xcite .",
    "an important difference with the cdf analysis comes from the limit determination which in the case of d  was set using the results of a topological likelihood discriminant  @xcite resulting in limits of comparable sensitivity , as shown in figures  [ www - limits ] .",
    "these limits are still a factor of about 20 above the standard model prediction for @xmath22 gev , but are more sensitive at low mass if one assumes fermiophobic models .",
    "( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( -205,175 ) ( 48,175 )      the most sensitive channel at high mass is by far , where production can be via gluon - gluon or vector - boson fusion .",
    "both cdf and d   have updated their previous results , and are using 2.4 and 2.3 fb@xmath0 respectively .",
    "we first describe the individual analysis , then their combination .",
    "the @xmath23 candidates are selected by triggering on single or di - lepton events with approximately 100% efficiency for the events of the final selection  @xcite . in the offline selection",
    ", electrons must be reconstructed within a detector pseudorapidity @xmath24 .",
    "muons are required to be in the fiducial coverage of the muon system @xmath25 .",
    "the two leptons must originate from the same primary vertex and are required to be of opposite charge .",
    "they must have @xmath26 20  gev for the leading electron and @xmath26 15  gev for the trailing one in the @xmath27 channel , @xmath26 15  gev for the electron and @xmath28 10  gev for the muon in the @xmath29 final state and @xmath28 10  gev for the leading and trailing muons in the @xmath30 final state . the di - lepton invariant mass must also be greater than 15 gev .    at this `` pre - selection '' stage ,",
    "the background is dominated by @xmath31 production which is suppressed by requiring missing transverse energy and scaled missing transverse energy  @xcite : @xmath31 , di - boson and multi - jet events are also rejected with a cut on the opening azimuthal angle @xmath32 , since most of the background decays are back - to - back which is not the case for higgs boson decays because of the spin correlations induced by its scalar nature .",
    "@xmath33 events are further rejected by a cut on @xmath34 , the scalar sum of the @xmath20 of good jets in the event .",
    "the signal and sm background processes are simulated with pythia  @xcite ( except for @xmath11/@xmath15+jets in the @xmath30 channel , where alpgen  @xcite is used ) using the cteq6.1 m  @xcite parton distribution functions .",
    "the @xmath35 cross section is calculated at nnlo  @xcite with cteq6.1 m pdfs .",
    "the nlo @xmath17 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 production cross section values are taken from  @xcite .",
    "the background due to multijet production , when jets are misidentified as leptons , is determined from the data .",
    "see  @xcite for more details and for the simulation of the other backgrounds .",
    "additional higgs mass and final - state dependent selections are optimized to further suppress contributions from @xmath31 , di - boson ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 , and multijet backgrounds .",
    "table  [ yields ] shows the number of expected and observed events after pre - selection and final selections ( i.e. nn input stage ) , for all three channels .    .[yields ] expected and observed number of events in each channel after pre - selection and final selections ( nn input stage ) .",

    "in fall 2007 , the two collaborations were asked to review their prospects for higgs sensitivity in case of a 2009 or a 2009 + 2010 running of the tevatron .",
    "looking back , since 2005 , the high mass experimental sensitivity for the higgs has improved by a factor of 1.7 ( without counting the gain due to luminosity ) and this was mainly due to improvements with multivariate techniques and with lepton acceptance . from 2007 to 2010 , estimated a possible additional improvement in analysis sensitivity by a factor of 1.4 , coming from increased lepton efficiency ( 10% per lepton ) and further multivariate analyses improvements ( 30% in sensitivity ) other potential improvements ( like the inclusion of tau channels ) were not included in the estimate .",
    "cdf estimates were similar , so we could effectively estimate the tevatron potential independently and both experiments reached similar conclusions .    at low mass , since 2005 , the analyses sensitivities have also improved by a factor of approximately 2 , due to increase in acceptance , kinematic phase space , trigger efficiency , asymmetric tagging for double b - tags , b - tagging improvements ( nn b - tagging ) , and improved statistical techniques / event nn discriminant from 2007 to 2010 , we estimated that we will gain an additional factor of 2.0 beyond the improvement expected from the increased luminosity : b - tagging improvements , di - jet mass resolution , increased lepton efficiency , improved multivariate techniques .    with such improvements ,",
    "we obtain the 95% c.l .",
    "and 3 @xmath40 sensitivity curves given in figure  [ prospects]a as a function of the analyzed data .",
    "the predicted delivered luminosity from the tevatron when adding a 2010 running is 8 fb@xmath0 , resulting in 6.8 fb@xmath0 of high quality analyzed data , as shown in the figure . with the data accumulated by the end of 2010",
    ", the combined data of the cdf and experiments could allow to explore much of the sm higgs mass region allowed by the precision electroweak measurements .",
    "three - sigma evidence for a higgs is possible over almost the entire range , as can be seen from the 1-@xmath40 band in figure  [ prospects]b , and is probable for the low and high end of this mass spectrum if the higgs boson lies there .",
    "the low mass searches are particularly important , since the tevatron and lhc would be searching for it in different decay modes (  at the tevatron , @xmath41 at the lhc ) .    in conclusion",
    ", the search for the sm higgs boson has reached a mature state at the tevatron , the combination techniques are in place , and the analyses are continuing to improve their individual sensitivity such that the tevatron combination would reach sm higgs sensitivity between 115 and 185 gev by the end of run ii ."
