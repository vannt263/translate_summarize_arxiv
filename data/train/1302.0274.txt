    "phone call activity patterns are a manifestation of our complex social dynamics .",
    "several aspects of our social behavior are reflected in these communication patterns , like day - night cycles , high activity at the end of working hours , or even our mobility patterns  @xcite .",
    "mobile phone data provides an excellent ground to study several interesting social processes such as , for instance , the spreading of news and rumors , which is the focus of this work .",
    "we start out by asking ourselves whether such phenomenon really occurs through the mobile phone network .",
    "a phone call certainly involves information exchange between two individuals , but is there information propagation involving more than a single phone call ?",
    "is it possible to answer this question without having access to the content of conversations ?",
    "mobile phone log data consists in who calls whom and when , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch]a . a natural way of representing this data is through the use of directed edges .",
    "for example , let us use @xmath0 to represent that user @xmath1 has called user @xmath2 . in addition , we have to associate to each directed edge a time series that symbolizes when ( and how many times ) this action took place .",
    "this procedure provides us with a representation of log data in terms of a directed network .    due to privacy issues we can not know which information",
    "is exchanged during phone calls .",
    "this constraint forces us to adopt a hypothesis regarding how information flows on the network .",
    "it has been argued that depending on the nature of the information , its propagation dynamics is different  @xcite .",
    "for example , a political opinion , a fad , a rumor , or a gossip , are supposed to involve , each of them , a different kind of human interaction dynamics which results in a different and particular propagation mechanism  @xcite . here",
    ", we assume that the information that is exchanged is either a rumor or news .",
    "the spreading of rumors and news is believed to resemble the spreading of an infectious disease  @xcite , .",
    "rumor spreading models  @xcite assume that there are two categories of users , those who are informed and those who are not",
    ". among informed users , there are in turn two sub - categories : users that are actively broadcasting the rumor , and users that become inactive .",
    "several mechanisms for switching from active to inactive spreading behavior have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "given the lack of empirical evidence to support a particular switching mechanism , here we adopt the simplest possible assumption already proposed for infectious disease  @xcite : there is a characteristic time @xmath3 after which an active spreader turns into inactive .",
    "there is , however , a deeper reason to use such a switching mechanism . according to this description",
    ", we can represent the sequence of events that propagates the infection as a _ causality tree_. our goal is to study causality trees as a proxy to understand information spreading , and for this we need a characteristic time scale which can be easily controlled .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 , which we refer to as _ monitoring time _ , serves this purpose .",
    "the mobile phone data , particularly the existence of directed edges , poses the question whether during a phone call the information exchange exhibits a favored flow direction . clearly , the information can flow from the caller to the callee , from the callee to the caller , or in both direction .",
    "if we think of a rumor being spread on the mobile phone network , and a phone call that involves an informed and an ignorant user , we can imagine that after the communication , both users are informed .",
    "this picture implies that non intentional spreading of the rumor can occur : if the caller is the ignorant user and get the information from the callee , then the phone call was not intended to propagate the rumor .",
    "this would mean that rumor spreading does not involve causality and it occurs without `` intentionality '' .",
    "a different scenario is one in which the spreading is exclusively active and intentional , and phone calls made by informed individuals are intended to propagate the information . in this scenario ,",
    "information propagates through active broadcasting , and involves causality .",
    "a user can get informed exclusively if he / she is called by an informed individual .",
    "thus , in this framework , causality trees describe information flow .    at this point",
    "we would like to mention two very recent works on information spreading on mobile phone networks that are particularly related to our study  @xcite .",
    "karsai et al .",
    "@xcite studied flooding of information in a mobile phone network .",
    "they assumed that users retransmit constantly the information they receive , and estimated the time required to inform everybody in the system .",
    "they concluded that the presence of community structures , i.e. , topological correlations , and bursty phone call activity slow down the spreading of information . in  @xcite , miritello et al . studied the propagation of information that obeys a susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) epidemic dynamics .",
    "they assumed that during a phone call information flows in both direction and made use of newman s theory for disease spreading on undirected complex networks  @xcite to interpret their results  .",
    "they exclusively focused on the average size of the outbreaks , and confirmed the results obtained in  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we observe that at short time - scales , i.e. , small @xmath3 values , the spreading dynamics , respectively the tree statistics , is not sensitive to topological node - node correlations and can be described simply in terms of the out degree distribution of the underlying social network . only at large time",
    "scales these node - node correlations become dominant , enhancing the spreading of information and allowing the circulation of information in ( closed ) loops .",
    "time - correlations , while they do not have a significant impact on information spreading , promote the existence of local information loops .",
    "it is only at this level that we observe genuine causality effects .",
    "for a given @xmath3 , we build the `` causality '' trees , which we also refer to as cascades , in the following way .",
    "we pick up at random a phone call from the database and monitor the activity of the receiver - e.g. user * a * - for a period @xmath3 .",
    "we register all phone calls user * a * makes during this period , and monitor the activity of all users who have been called by user * a * during a period @xmath3 .",
    "we repeat this process for every _ new _ user until the cascade gets extinguished .",
    "this occurs when all users in the tree have exceeded the monitoring time @xmath3 and there is no new user to monitor",
    "[ fig : sketch]a and  [ fig : sketch]b illustrate this procedure , which has been also applied in  @xcite .",
    "notice that the proposed method is equivalent to inoculate a susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) disease to user * a * and wait for the infection outbreak to get extinguished .",
    "this dynamics is similar to the one proposed for rumor spreading as defined in  @xcite .",
    "susceptible ( i.e. , uninformed ) users only get infected by receiving a phone call from an already infected user , i.e. , phone calls imply directed links .",
    "finally , the transition from the infected to recovered state occurs after a time @xmath3 .",
    "we focus on two features of the trees : their size @xmath4 and their depth @xmath5 .",
    "the tree size @xmath4 is simply the number of users forming the tree .",
    "we use the term _ depth _ to refer to the distance ( in terms of nodes ) to the initial node , with @xmath5 defined as the maximum depth of the tree , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch]c .",
    "to gain insight into the statistics of the causality trees , we first propose a simple transmission theory relying on the following assumptions .",
    "a ) there exists an underlying social network which is static .",
    "though we know that at large time scales , e.g. , years , the underlying social network is necessarily dynamic , we assume that at short time scales of the order of hours to few days the static approximation provides a reasonable description .",
    "b ) given a couple of nodes @xmath1 and @xmath2 , there is a directed link from @xmath1 to @xmath2 if @xmath1 called @xmath2 at least once in the database , i.e , if the directed link is present in the underlying social network .",
    "this directed link is associated to a time series : the timestamps at which @xmath1 has contacted @xmath2 . for every @xmath0 link",
    "we can define a communication rate @xmath6 that indicates the rate at which the link is active to transmit information .",
    "this is simply the number of phone calls @xmath0 that occurred in the database , divided by the total time @xmath7 .",
    "c ) we define causality trees as sequences of consecutive phone calls where the time difference between consecutive phone calls is always less or equal to our observation time @xmath3 .",
    "the mean - field associated with this simplified process reads : @xmath8 where the dots indicate time derivatives , @xmath9 refers to the fraction of individuals that are uninformed at time @xmath10 , @xmath11 to those that are informed and retransmitting the information , and @xmath12 to those that got the information and stop retransmitting , @xmath13 is the average @xmath6 , and @xmath14 the average ( out-)degree .",
    "notice that for directed networks , the average in- and out - degree are the same .",
    "the average cascade size @xmath15 is the average number of individuals that got the information once the process is extinguished , i.e. , when there is no more users retransmitting the information and @xmath16 .",
    "it is easy to realize from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfa ] ) that @xmath17 $ ] , and @xmath18 . using the fact that @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we obtain that the number of users that once got the information , i.e. , the average tree size , @xmath21 , reads : @xmath22 } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the number of users in the system .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) defines a self - consistency equation for @xmath15 . from this expression",
    "we can derive the critical monitoring time @xmath24 required to observe infinite tree sizes : @xmath25 this means that if nodes retransmit the information that they get for a period @xmath26 the resulting trees can be arbitrarily large .",
    "it is important to make the distinction between the duration of cascade events , i.e. , the time elapsed between the first and last phone call of the tree , and the monitoring time @xmath3 .",
    "for instance ,",
    "when @xmath27 only a small fraction of the cascades percolates and consequently the average tree duration is shorter than @xmath24 .",
    "notice that the monitoring time @xmath3 refers ( and controls ) the individual behavior of users as callers .",
    "in fact , we are asking ourselves how the individual behavior of users should be in order to allow a rumor to take over a macroscopic fraction of the system .",
    "we will come back to this point later on and look for an interpretation of this relevant quantity .",
    "now let us consider the other hypothesis mentioned in the introduction , i.e. , let us imagine that information travels in both directions of the directed edges . in this case , we can still use eq .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) to describe the spreading process , but parameters have a different meaning . the average rate activity @xmath28 now represents the activity of an undirected edge , i.e. , it is the average of @xmath29 . finally , the average out - degree @xmath14 has to be replaced by the average ( undirected ) degree @xmath30 , since now edges are undirected .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfathreshold ] ) becomes : @xmath31 .",
    "our goal is to obtain an expression for the probability @xmath32 of finding a user with in - degree @xmath33 and out - degree @xmath34 for a given @xmath3 .",
    "the in - degree @xmath33 represents the number of different users that have called the user during @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , @xmath34 denotes the number of different users that the user has called during the monitoring time @xmath3 .",
    "this means that we are considering that there is an underlying static network whose directed links are switched on and off  this dynamics defines a ( directed ) dynamical network .    in order to compute @xmath35 , we need to know the probability that an edge is activated within a period @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , we need to know for a node that has in - degree @xmath36 and out - degree @xmath37 , the probability per in - edge @xmath38 and per out - edge @xmath39 of being used within a period @xmath3 . then , if for instance @xmath40 , the probability that two of the three in - edges are used while one is not , is @xmath41 .",
    "we denote the probability of finding a node with in - degree @xmath33 and out - degree @xmath34 : @xmath42 .",
    "the probability @xmath43 refers to the static underlying network that contains all connections that have occurred in the whole database .",
    "thus , assuming that the in - degree of a node is uncorrelated with the out - degree of other nodes , we can express @xmath32 as :    @xmath44    where we have also assumed that the activity of an edge is independent of the activity of the other edges , and used the binomial distribution approximation explained above . to simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq : pkiko ] ) , we make another assumption : the edge activity is independent of the in- or out - degree of the node , i.e. @xmath45 . edges exhibit a heterogeneous distribution @xmath46 of communication rates @xmath47 .",
    "let us recall that @xmath47 is the rate at which an edge is used within @xmath48 , i.e. , the number of phone calls through the edge divided the total time @xmath7 .",
    "we need an estimate for the probability @xmath49 that the edge is used during @xmath3 . knowing @xmath47 and assuming a poissonian process , the probability that the edge is used is @xmath50  @xcite . under these assumptions",
    "@xmath49 can be estimated as : @xmath51    if now we consider that information travels in both direction of the edges , we need to take into account the undirected degree distribution exhibited by the nodes .",
    "along similar lines , we can express the probability @xmath52 of finding a user of undirected degree @xmath53 for a given @xmath3 as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 refers to the degree distribution of the undirected static social network , and @xmath56 is the probability that an edge connected to a node of degree @xmath57 is used during @xmath3 .",
    "we now look for an expression of the critical monitoring time @xmath24 , which is sensitive to the topological structure of the underlying static network . as before , we start by assuming that the underlying static network is directed  below we address the alternative case where information travels in both direction on edges . to derive the percolation threshold from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pkiko ] ) , we look for the associated generating function @xmath58 . after exchanging the order of the sums in order to use the binomial expansion ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath59 the process described here corresponds to a situation where , for a given @xmath3 , some edges are activated while others remain silent .",
    "we want to know whether the ( directed ) network of activated edges contains giant trees .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , the condition for having infinite clusters in ( static ) directed networks is @xmath60 .",
    "we can evaluate this condition for our dynamical network using eq.([eq : generating ] ) , and recalling that @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "the evaluation of the above mentioned condition leads to : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "notice that if the underlying network does not exhibit a giant component for @xmath66 , condition ( [ eq : threshold_t ] ) can not be fulfilled for any @xmath3 .    to gain some intuition ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath67 , so that from eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) we can approximate @xmath49 as @xmath68 so that : @xmath69    let us now consider the following two extreme cases : a ) a fully in - out degree correlated underlying static network , where @xmath70 , for which we get @xmath71 and b ) a fully in - out degree uncorrelated underlying static network , i.e. , @xmath72 , where we find that @xmath73 which is exactly the mean - field prediction given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfathreshold ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : firstmoments ] we compare the average tree size obtained from the data with the above discussed theoretical arguments .",
    "[ fig : firstmoments ] shows that there is large difference between the thresholds corresponding to the extreme cases given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : thresholdcorrelation ] ) and ( [ eq : thresholdfullycorrelated ] ) , more than @xmath74 hours , which indicates that the spreading process strongly depends on the in - out degree correlations .",
    "how can we understand that correlations have such an important effect on the spreading process ? if we look at either the in- or the out - degree distribution of the underlying static network , we observe that both of these distributions exhibit fat tails , see fig .",
    "[ fig : degree_correlations]a .",
    "the heterogeneity of user degree implies the presence of super - spreaders as well as super - receivers .",
    "though the relevance of super - spreaders have been well identified and understood since many years  @xcite , the existence and role of super - receivers have remained relatively unexplored , except for a few noticeable works where the relevance of in - out degree correlations were acknowledged  @xcite .",
    "if information travels in both direction on edges , we have to make use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pkuncorrelated ] ) .",
    "its associated generating function reads : @xmath75 where as explained above , @xmath55 refers to the degree distribution of the undirected underlying network and @xmath76 to the probability that an undirected edge is used during @xmath3 . to obtain @xmath24 , we make use of the well - known percolation criterion for uncorrelated undirected networks , @xmath77  @xcite . as before , if we assume that @xmath78 , then : @xmath79 this result has been derived by newman in  @xcite and recently used in the context of a mobile phone network by miritello et al . in  @xcite . the estimated value for @xmath24 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : uncorrelatedthreshold ] ) is @xmath80 hours .",
    "we recall that if the information travels along the direction given by the directed edges , the critical @xmath24 corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ eq : thresholdcorrelation ] ) . the prediction given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : uncorrelatedthreshold ] ) is close to that obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : thresholdfullycorrelated ] ) , which corresponds the fully correlated scenario discussed above , see fig .",
    "[ fig : firstmoments ] .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq : thresholdcorrelation ] ) never reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eq : uncorrelatedthreshold ] ) .",
    "this indicates that that directed , that is to say , intentional or active information propagation is qualitatively different from unintentional information spreading , i.e. , when information travels in both direction along edges .",
    "for instance , while for unintentional spreading @xmath24 depends always on the second moment of the degree distribution , for intentional spreading it may not depend on it , if the network is in - out degree uncorrelated .      in the following we focus on the statistical features of the trees .",
    "we start out by estimating the size distribution @xmath81 under the assumption that information travels in the direction of the ( directed ) edges . in order to get an analytical estimate of @xmath81 , we neglect node - node correlations in the underlying static network as well as temporal correlations among nodes",
    ". it will be clear that node - node ( topological ) correlations can be ignored for @xmath82 , while temporal correlations are always too weak to impact the spreading dynamics ( see below ) .",
    "we further assume that trees are fully determined by the out - degree @xmath83 , but as we will see , the assumption breaks down as we approach @xmath24 .",
    "these simplifications allow us to estimate the probability @xmath84 of finding a tree of size one as the probability that the root node has out - degree @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath86 .",
    "the probability @xmath87 of finding a tree of size two has to be equal to the probability that the root node has out - degree @xmath88 while simultaneously its unique branch has to lead to a sub - cascade of size @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 .",
    "more generally , @xmath90 is related to @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "this relation can be expressed in a compact and elegant way in term of the generating function @xmath93 which obeys the following self - consistency equation  @xcite : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the generating function of the out - degree distribution @xmath96 that is defined as : @xmath97 the cascade size distribution can be obtained from the derivatives of @xmath98 as @xmath99 in summary , eq.([eq : gz ] ) provides us with a method to derive @xmath90 under the assumption that the tree statistics is given by a galton - watson ( gw ) process  @xcite that is fully determined by @xmath83 .",
    "notice that for a given @xmath3 , the out - degree distribution @xmath83 can be approximated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : generating ] ) as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : outout ] ) . this approximation starts to fail for large values of @xmath3 due to the non - homogenous activity of node over time .",
    "alternatively , @xmath83 can be directly measured from the data for each @xmath3 .",
    "now we look for an estimate of the depth distribution @xmath100 under the same assumptions , i.e. , the tree statistics is given by a gw process fully determined by @xmath83 .",
    "we define @xmath101 , with @xmath102 .",
    "we look for the probability @xmath103 that a tree gets extinguished at depth less or equal than @xmath5 .",
    "the probability @xmath103 obeys @xmath104 .",
    "using a more compact notation  @xcite , this relation reads : @xmath105 on the other hand , the probability that a tree gets extinguished at @xmath106 is directly the probability that a node does not make phone any phone call in a period @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath107 .",
    "thus , using the above given definition of @xmath108 , we rephrase eq.([eq : cond_ed ] ) as : @xmath109 we can draw the probability @xmath110 from @xmath103 , as : @xmath111 if we assume that information can flow in both direction of the edges , the above depicted gw process for a directed underlying network can be easily adapted to an undirected network , the main difference being that the gw process is now fully determined by the ( undirected ) degree distribution @xmath112  see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pkuncorrelated ] ) . except for this , the computations of @xmath90 and @xmath113 follows similar lines , taking into account that a node of degree @xmath53 can contribute at most with @xmath114 new nodes to the growing tree .",
    "[ fig : comparison_dist ] shows a comparison between eq .",
    "( [ eq : gz ] ) ( analyt . ) , simulations of the proposed gw process ( gw synt . ) , and the tree statistics obtained from mobile phone data ( data ) .",
    "the figure indicates that as long as @xmath115 , the proposed theory provides a good estimate for the tree statistics .",
    "as @xmath116 ( and still for @xmath115 ) , the theory , that neglects ( topological ) node - node correlations as well as causality effects , systematically underestimates the probability of observing large trees . the origin of this discrepancy can be rooted either in the presence of node - node correlations in the underlying network , or in strong causality effects arising from temporal correlations .      in the following",
    "we explore the possibility of local causality effects in the form of causality loops .",
    "closed causality patterns do not contribute to the spreading of the information and are not visible at the level of the tree statistics , since they do not involve the addition of new informed users to the set of informed ones .",
    "we consider two types of patterns : the first pattern involves a three - node chain , where user @xmath1 calls user @xmath2 at time @xmath117 and user @xmath2 calls user @xmath53 at some later time @xmath118 , with @xmath119 .",
    "we define the reciprocity coefficient @xmath120 as the fraction of three - node chains where @xmath121 , fig .",

    "[ fig : clustering ] shows that @xmath123 and @xmath122 converge for @xmath124 to an asymptotic value for both the original and rt data .",
    "though the number of three - node and four - node chains increase monotonically with @xmath3 , the fractions @xmath120 and @xmath125 , corresponding to closed loops , reach asymptotic values , which indicates that closed chains grow at the same rate with @xmath3 .",
    "the curves @xmath120 and @xmath122 for rt data corresponds to the fraction of cycles , involving two and three nodes , respectively , expected in absence of causality effects and induced by the topology of the underlying static network and edge activity rate @xmath46 .",

    "the abundance of causality loops in the original data with respect to rt data , reveals that at short time scales the original data exhibits strong causality effects .",
    "interestingly , the asymptotic @xmath120 value for the original and rt data do not coincide , being always larger for the original than for rt data .",
    "this indicates that for any value of @xmath3 the number of reciprocal phone calls in the original data is larger than what is expected in the absence of time correlations .",
    "this finding is likely to be related to the typical message - reply dynamics observed for instance in email data  @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the number of three - node loops in the original data seems to converge asymptotically with @xmath3 to the expected value in the absence of correlations .",
    "we have shown that the mobile phone data ( as many other communication data ) can be represented by a directed ( dynamical ) network , and argued that intentional information spreading requires information to flow in the direction given by the directed edges .",
    "we have explored this possibility and studied the topological properties of causality trees , such as size and depth , as a proxy to understand information propagation .",
    "we have introduced a time - scale in the system , the monitoring time @xmath3 , which provides a tolerance time that allows us to relate two phone calls as causally linked .",
    "the properties of the causality trees have been studied as function of this time - scale @xmath3 .",
    "our first observation is that the representation of the data in terms of directed edges reveals the existence of super - spreaders and super - receivers .",
    "we have shown that the tree statistics , respectively the information spreading process , are extremely sensitive to the in - out degree correlation of the users .",
    "moreover , we have clearly pointed out that the spreading dynamics under the assumption of intentional spreading is qualitatively different from that obtained under the assumption of unintentional spreading , i.e. , when information flows in both direction along edges ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : thresholdcorrelation ] ) ,  ( [ eq : thresholdfullycorrelated ] ) ,  ( [ eq : thresholdfullyuncorrelated ] ) , and  ( [ eq : uncorrelatedthreshold ] ) , and discussion below these equations ) . the good matching at short time - scales between the tree statistics obtained from the original data and the theoretical predictions that neglect time correlations and topological node - node correlations has allowed us to conclude that none of these correlations have a strong effect on the tree statistics .",
    "this means that at short time - scales trees can be roughly described as a simple gw process .",
    "however , at larger time - scales the tree statistics can no longer be explained in terms of this simple theory .",
    "the tree statistics obtained from randomized time - stamp data indicates that topological node - node correlations , present in the original data but neglected in the theory , dominate the spreading dynamics at these time - scales .",
    "moreover , we have learned that these topological correlations promote bigger trees .",
    "these findings together with the observation that a given information , e.g. , a rumor , would require users to retransmit it for more than 30 hours in order to cover a macroscopic fraction of the system , suggest that there is no intentional broadcasting of information .",
    "in fact , the very idea that there is information spreading beyond nearest and second - nearest neighbors , i.e. , beyond a small vicinity , is called into question . at the local level , however , we have observed that time correlations enhance the number of dynamical closed patterns , an effect particularly evident at short time scales .",
    "it is only at this level that genuine causality effects , and consequently intentional information propagation , are detectable .",
    "nevertheless we stress that these observations apply exclusively to local information circulation .",
    "the analysis performed here can be applied to other communication network data like blog and email data  @xcite , as well as mobile phone data in the presence of exceptional events like natural disasters  @xcite , where different tree structures , and consequently tree statistics , are likely to emerge .",
    "finally , the cascade theory we have implemented here applies to directed networks in the absence of node - node ( topological ) correlations",
    ". generalizations to account for node - node correlations along the lines of  @xcite should be possible .",
    "the mobile phone data we have analyzed corresponds to one month of phone calls from a european mobile phone provider . to guarantee confidentiality ,",
    "phone numbers were anonymized .",
    "this represents 1.044.397 users , that form a connected component , and 13.983.433 phone calls among these users .",
    "since our goal has been to study information transmission , we have constrained ourselves to the study of `` successful '' phone calls  i.e. , those where the receiver has answered the phone call . there is an average activity of @xmath126 phone calls per second , which leads to an average of @xmath127 phone calls per second per directed edge .",

    "we have performed the data analysis on three datasets : the original data set and two copies of it , one where we have reshuffled the time stamps of the phone calls , which we refer to as rt data , and another where we have randomized the order to the phone calls of every user , which we refer to as rc data .",
    "the rt dataset is an exact copy of the original data set , where source and destination of every phone call remains the same , but the time - stamp of phone calls are randomly exchanged .",

    "<S> without having direct access to the information that is being exchanged , traces of information flow can be obtained by looking at temporal sequences of user interactions . </S>",
    "<S> these sequences can be represented as causality trees whose statistics result from a complex interplay between the topology of the underlying ( social ) network and the time correlations among the communications . here </S>",
    "<S> , we study causality trees in mobile - phone data , which can be represented as a dynamical directed network . </S>",
    "<S> this representation of the data reveals the existence of super - spreaders and super - receivers . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the tree statistics , respectively the information spreading process , are extremely sensitive to the in - out degree correlation exhibited by the users . </S>",
    "<S> we also learn that a given information , e.g. , a rumor , would require users to retransmit it for more than 30 hours in order to cover a macroscopic fraction of the system . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis indicates that topological node - node correlations of the underlying social network , while allowing the existence of information loops , they also promote information spreading . </S>",
    "<S> temporal correlations , and therefore causality effects , are only visible as local phenomena and during short time scales . </S>",
    "<S> these results are obtained through a combination of theory and data analysis techniques . </S>"
