    "an issue of high current interest in nuclear research is the physics behind systems and processes where the isovector component of the nuclear interaction is relevant .",
    "this particular aspect is of pivotal importance in understanding a wide variety of phenomena such as extreme isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , nuclear systems far from stability , collisions of radioactive beams , the asymmetry energy of nuclear systems and ( _ p , n _ ) charge - exchange processes @xcite .",
    "a sound understanding of these phenomena may have significant impact on other areas of research such the physics of neutron stars , the formation of astrophysical objects , etc .",
    "our focus here is on the study of charge - exchange reactions at intermediate energies .",
    "this effort attempts to provide a rigorous microscopic approach for the study of these reactions with emphasis on a detailed account of genuine energy , momentum and density effects in the nucleon - nucleon ( _ nn _ ) effective interaction .",
    "the study of ( _ p , n _ ) charge - exchange reactions at intermediate energies has received considerable attention during the past few decades .",
    "these reactions have been of great value in understanding the isovector modes of excitation of nuclei . at beam energies above 100 mev",
    ", nucleon charge - exchange reactions can be considered as a one step process , thus allowing a rather clean separation of the nuclear structure from the underlying _ nn _ effective interaction .",
    "these arguments have resulted in the usual @xmath3 structure of the coupling to the nucleus .",
    "furthermore , the weak strength of the isovector component of the interaction relative to its isoscalar counterpart has made suitable the use of the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) . in spite of these advantageous considerations ,",
    "no microscopic effort has been able to satisfactorily describe the differential cross - section data without phenomenological adjustments _ a posteriori _ of the nucleon - nucleus ( _ na _ ) coupling .",
    "this impediment is quite significant in that it points to a lack of understanding of the simplest process beyond elastic collisions .",
    "therefore , a comprehensive and consistent re - analysis of the problem is relevant .",
    "studies of nucleon elastic scattering at intermediate energies ( i.e. between 100 mev and 1 gev ) have demonstrated the importance of off - shell effects as accounted for within the full - folding omp for ( _ na _ ) scattering . in particular , it was shown that the @xmath3 scheme ( as most often applied ) is insufficient to satisfactorily describe intermediate energy data . furthermore , nuclear medium effects as included by using nuclear matter @xmath4 matrices have provided significant improvements in the description of the elastic scattering data @xcite .",
    "the issue which naturally arises is whether these improvements within the full - folding omp to _ na _ elastic scattering are also important in charge - exchange processes .",
    "although significant advances have been made with the introduction of full - folding optical potentials in the description of nucleon elastic scattering , none of these improvements have been included in charge - exchange reactions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , most of the reported ( _ p , n _ ) reaction calculations , which provide a reasonable description of the data , are semi - phenomenological in the sense that well fitted potentials in the elastic channel are used to obtain the charge - exchange cross - section by means of the dwba @xcite . from this prospective additional theoretical effort",
    "is needed to clarify the issues which prevent us from obtaining a unified understanding of these phenomena . along this line ,",
    "the aim of the present work is to asses the importance of treating the intrinsic off - shell behavior of , and medium corrections to , realistic nuclear effective interactions in the calculation of nuclear charge - exchange reactions . for this purpose",
    "we present the spin - isospin formalism needed to calculate these couplings within the non - local full - folding optical model and have developed the required coupled - channel scattering codes to solve the scattering problem exactly .",
    "our work is focused on the @xmath0 isobaric analog state ( ias ) transitions for various targets and incident proton energies .",
    "we organize this article in five sections as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the spin - isospin structure of the _ na _ coupling to display its formal structure suited for charge - exchange reactions from a finite nucleus . in section iii we outline the coupled - channel approach for studying the ( _ p , n _ ) charge - exchange reactions with non - local potentials in the presence of the coulomb interaction . in section",
    "iv we present and interpret results for representative applications and in section v we summarize the present work and draw the main conclusions .",
    "for simplicity in this discussion , we use the free @xmath5 matrix as the _ nn _ effective interaction and consider nonrelativistic kinematics .",
    "both of these restrictions will be removed in the following sections .",
    "thus , the generalized optical potential for nucleon scattering and charge - exchange reactions may be written in momentum space as @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the antisymmetrized _ nn _ @xmath5 matrix ;",

    "the cd - bonn potential exhibits a distinctive uniform growth , being followed less strongly by the nijmegen i and reid-93 models . over the whole energy range both the argonne av18 and nijmegen ii potentials yield results in closest agreement with the data .",
    "in contrast , the paris potential exhibits qualitative differences from the other models , particularly the depth of its minimum near 300 mev .    in a broad sense ,",

    "thus , they illustrate the degree of consistency among the three components of the potential within the theory .",

    "a comparison at the hadronic level alone ( i.e. suppressing the coulomb term ) is presented in the lower frame , where we show the differential cross section for _ uncharged _ nucleon scattering using the full - folding @xmath125 ( solid curve ) , @xmath126 ( dashed curve ) and the local ws parametrization ( sparse crosses ) .",
    "the similarity between the @xmath125 and @xmath126 is striking , suggesting their equivalence .",

    "[ dwba ] we compare the consistent coupled - channel full - folding omp results ( solid curve ) with the corresponding dwba results ( dashed curves ) . in both cases we use the same @xmath181 based on the full - folding omp .",
    "however , for the dwba application we use the parametric ws potential already described .",
    "the significant increase of the differential cross section over whole the angular range is clear .    in fig .",
    "[ famplit ] we present the scattering amplitude ( @xmath182 ) as function of the angular momentum @xmath68 .",

    "( [ amplit ] ) and ( [ intamplit ] ) , with the solid curves representing the sum of both contributions .",
    "the stars ( @xmath183 ) represent results based on dwba using the full - folding _",
    "x _ and _ nn _ couplings ( dwba - cc ) .",
    "the dashed curves correspond to dwba calculations where the _ nn _ term has been replaced by a local ws parametrization ( dwba - ws ) . clearly",
    "the imaginary component of the amplitude ( lower frame ) exhibits minor differences among the exact coupled - channel , dwba - cc and dwba - ws results .",
    "additionally , we observe that the total amplitude is the result of a mutual cancellation of the @xmath181 and @xmath126 contributions . in the upper frame for the real components , however , we notice major differences between dwba - ws and either of the two coupled - channel applications",
    ". indeed , the real part of of the dwba - ws amplitude is nearly twice as large as the other two .",
    "this difference is exclusively due to the nature of the diagonal coupling , extracted phenomenologically from other sources . in that sense , a phenomenological improvement of the data is achieved at the expense of a consistent two - channel description of the charge - exchange process .",
    "the difficulties discussed above have been explored in the context of the neutron - to - proton relative distribution .",
    "we have investigated the discrepancy between the consistent coupled - channel @xmath4-matrix omp results and the measured quantities by studying the sensitivity of the scattering observables to variations in the neutron density @xcite .",
    "preliminary results along this line suggest the presence of a neutron halo in the nuclear periphery , that is to say , pronounced ratio of the neutron to proton density away from the nuclear surface . a more thorough investigation of this fact is a natural extension of the present work , and should not be limited to the radial matter distribution but include other features of the mixed density as well .",
    "an additional element in this discussion is the charge - dependence of the _ nn _ interaction , which in this work , has only been included in the @xmath168 _ nn _ sector .",
    "various microscopic studies on ( _ p , n _ ) charge - exchange reactions have been presented in the past .",
    "the most recent one by bauge _",
    "_ @xcite consists of a lane - consistent semi - microscopic optical model approach where an energy - dependent potential depth normalization factor is applied to the isovector components .",
    "these normalization factors are then used consistently in elastic and quasielastic scattering . their quasielastic charge - exchange applications between 100 and 200 mev exhibit less pronounced discrepancies with the data relative to the ones presented in this work .",
    "a microscopic extraction of these scaling factors remains to be seen .    a relativistic description of ( _ p , n _ ) quasielastic reactions has also been provided by clark _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in their case",
    "the relativistic impulse approximation is used , where lorentz vector and scalar , isovector and isoscalar _ na _ optical potentials are obtained from invariant _ nn _ amplitudes .",
    "applications at 160 mev for @xmath170zr_(p , n ) _ lead to a fermi cross section weaker by a factor of 2 relative to the data .",
    "their interpretation is that the diagonal optical potential presents too much absorption .",
    "a sizable improvement in the description of the differential cross section is obtained with the use of phenomenological ( diagonal ) potentials in conjunction with dwba .",
    "although both approaches provide means by which to improve the description of the data , they also emphasize the limited understanding of this very simple process .",
    "we have studied quasielastic ( _ p , n _ ) charge - exchange reactions to the ias at proton energies between 80 and 800 mev .",
    "the study is based on an extension of the microscopic full - folding optical model approach for _ na _ elastic scattering to processes where spin and isospin excitations become allowed .",
    "thus , we have developed the necessary spin - isospin recoupling in order to identify the off diagonal terms responsible for the exchange mechanism . in this particular work",
    "we focus on isospin excitations only .",
    "the resulting couplings , in the form of non - local optical potentials , are then applied to quasielastic ( _ p , n _ ) reactions on @xmath1c , @xmath173ca and @xmath170zr at intermediate proton energies .",
    "emphasis is given to the full consistency of the microscopic approach , without resorting to the use of adjusting parameters of the model in order to describe the data .",
    "indeed , it has been a primary focus of this work to disclose its limitations in its most complete current form , _",
    "i.e. _ with an accurate account of the fermi motion ( off shell ) , and implied non localities in the optical potentials .",
    "exact coupled - channel calculations , within numerical accuracy , were performed to obtain the scattering observables .",
    "comparisons with the data show a persistent deficiency of the theory to account for them in a consistent fashion .",
    "this is particularly so in the case of the heavier targets , where the zero - degree fermi cross sections are substantially underestimated .",
    "we observe , however , that the use of phenomenological representations of the optical potential for the elastic channel yields sizable changes of the fermi cross sections .",
    "however , this phenomenological correction does not allow a clear identification of the missing microscopic effects needed to account for the data .",
    "the above mentioned limitations become less dramatic in the case of ( _ p , n _ ) charge - exchange reactions on @xmath1c . in this case",
    "the full - folding optical model approach is able to explain reasonably well the differential cross section at 120 mev .",
    "additionally , depending on the _ nn _ potential model , the fermi cross section is described with varying degrees of success in the energy range 80 - 800 mev .",
    "these applications represent extrapolations of the of the underlying _ nn _ potential model and favor the nijmegen ii and argonne av18 models .",
    "a more definitive assessment of such results would require , however , the account for the above - threshold inelasticities at the _ nn _ level , an issue to be considered in the future .",
    "though this work represents the most complete microscopic calculations to date , accounting for full fermi motion effects and implied non localities , with an accurate treatment of the resulting coupled - channel reaction equations , we conclude that the model is still unable to satisfactorily describe the data .",
    "the discrepancies are not minor , especially in the cases of ( _ p , n _ ) reactions on @xmath173ca and @xmath170zr studied here , where the zero - degree fermi cross section is underestimated by factors of 2 or 3 .",
    "although the data can be described by using distorted waves based on phenomenological optical models , or by adjusting other parameters of the model , we have preferred to maintain the formal structure of the theory to stress the limitations of the microscopic model in its current form .",
    "there are other venues for the inclusion of additional effects not discussed here . among the most immediate ones we mention the role of asymmetric nuclear matter in the _ nn _ effective interaction and the neutron distribution in the target ground state @xcite .",
    "work toward inclusion of isospin asymmetry in the effective interaction is under way .",
