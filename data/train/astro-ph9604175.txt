    "hierarchical models of structure formation , in which small scale perturbations collapse gravitationally and merge into progressively larger objects , offer an attractive theoretical setting for galaxy formation . as first emphasized by white & rees ( 1978 )",
    ", the dissipation of the gas component inside dark matter halos can explain the gap between the masses of large galaxies and the masses of rich clusters , and the combination of cooling arguments with the formation and merger history of the dark halos allows a prediction of the baryonic mass function of galaxies .",
    "the white & rees picture of galaxy formation fits naturally into the more encompassing inflation plus cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory ( peebles 1982 ; blumenthal et al .  1984 ) and its variants involving a cosmological constant , space curvature , or an admixture of hot dark matter .",
    "however , attempts to predict the galaxy luminosity function in such scenarios , using analytic and semi - analytic extensions of the press - schechter ( 1974 ) formalism , have revealed a persistent difficulty : these hierarchical models predict an abundance of faint galaxies that far exceeds that in most estimates of the galaxy luminosity function ( e.g. , white & frenk 1991 ; kauffmann , white , & guideroni 1993 ; cole et al .",
    "1994 ; heyl et al .",
    "this defect is of great interest , since it could undermine not just specific cosmological models but the entire class of hierarchical theories of galaxy formation .",
    "various ideas have been proposed to overcome this `` faint galaxy excess '' problem , including feedback from star formation ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ; cole 1991 ; lacey & silk 1991 ; white & frenk 1991 ) pre - heating of the intergalactic medium ( e.g. , blanchard , valls - gabaud & mamon 1992 ; tegmark , silk & evrard 1993 ) , and the possibility that faint galaxies are present in the real universe but are undercounted in most surveys because of their low surface brightness ( e.g. , ferguson & mcgaugh 1995 ) .",
    "efstathiou ( 1992 ; see also ikeuchi 1986 ; rees 1986 ; babul & rees 1992 ) suggested that the formation of low mass galaxies might instead be suppressed by photoionization from an ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation background , which can heat diffuse gas to temperatures of a few@xmath4k and eliminate the dominant sources of atomic cooling at temperatures below @xmath5k .",
    "the photoionization solution is an attractive one , for the observed quasars alone should produce a rather strong uv background at redshifts @xmath6 , and massive star formation in young galaxies would only increase the effect . in an isolated , coherent collapse ,",
    "one expects the influence of photoionization to be small for objects with virial temperatures above @xmath7k , since at these temperatures primordial composition gas is highly ionized by collisions alone .",
    "however , in a hierarchical scenario galaxies form by mergers of smaller subunits , and processes that affect these subunits may be able to percolate their influence to larger mass scales .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the effects of photoionization on galaxy formation using 3-dimensional simulations that follow the evolution of gas and dark matter in an expanding universe .",
    "our simulations use treesph  ( hernquist & katz 1989 ; katz , weinberg , & hernquist 1996 , hereafter kwh ) , a code that combines smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ; see , e.g. , lucy 1977 ; gingold & monaghan 1977 ; monaghan 1992 ) with a hierarchical tree method for computing gravitational forces ( barnes & hut 1986 ; hernquist 1987 ) in a periodic volume ( bouchet & hernquist 1988 ; hernquist , bouchet & suto 1991 ) .",
    "this numerical treatment avoids the physical idealizations required in efstathiou s ( 1992 ) semi - analytic treatment , which made his quantitative conclusions rather uncertain .",
    "our simulation volume is large enough to contain many galaxies embedded in an appropriate large scale environment , so our analysis complements the numerical studies of steinmetz ( 1995 ) , quinn , katz , & efstathiou ( 1996 ; hereafter qke ) and thoul & weinberg ( 1996 ; hereafter tw ) , which examine collapses of individual objects with higher resolution ( see discussion in  5 ) .",
    "the middle phrase of our tripartite title may seem out of place : photoionization is a _ physical _ process that might plausibly influence galaxy formation , but numerical resolution is not .",
    "however , numerical resolution can have a critical effect on simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "furthermore , the interaction between resolution and assumptions about gas microphysics ( photoionization in particular ) can be quite subtle . to demonstrate these points , it is most revealing to describe our results in the order in which we obtained them .",
    "after summarizing the physical effects of photoionization in  2 , we first present results from a series of low resolution simulations in  3 , then move to high resolution simulations in  4 . in  5 we discuss the implications of our results for numerical simulations and for the `` faint galaxy '' problem .",
    "as emphasized by efstathiou ( 1992 ) and tw , a photoionizing background field can have at least two important effects on gas that would otherwise cool and collapse into galaxies .",
    "first , heating the gas may stabilize it against gravitational collapse , preventing it from falling into shallow dark matter potential wells .",
    "second , an ionizing background can greatly lengthen cooling times , making it impossible for gas to dissipate the thermal energy generated by collapse and cool to temperatures and densities at which star formation can occur . figures  [ figeqcool ] and [ figioncool ] illustrate these effects . figure  [ figeqcool ]",
    "shows the cooling rate as a function of temperature for primordial composition gas , 76% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass , with no ionizing background .",
    "abundances of ionic species are computed assuming collisional equilibrium , i.e. , that the rate at which any species is destroyed by collisional ionization or recombination is equal to the rate at which it is created by collisional ionization or recombination of other species . in this approximation",
    ", relative abundances depend only on temperature , and because the cooling is dominated by two - body processes , the cooling rate at fixed temperature is simply proportional to the square of the gas density . in figure",
    "[ figeqcool ] , @xmath8 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei  @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the hydrogen fraction . in a cosmological context , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the baryon density parameter ,",
    "@xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the ratio of the local gas density to the average gas density .",
    "= 3.5truein    the ionization , recombination , and cooling rates used for figure  [ figeqcool ] are taken primarily from black ( 1981 ) and cen ( 1992 ) ; the full set of adopted rates and abundance equations appears in kwh . at low ( @xmath15 ) and moderate ( @xmath16 ) temperatures ,",
    "cooling is dominated by collisional excitations of hydrogen and singly ionized helium , respectively . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the gas is almost fully ionized , and free - free emission dominates . at @xmath18 ,",
    "the gas is entirely neutral , and collisions are too weak to produce excitation , so the cooling rate is essentially zero .",
    "( molecular cooling can become significant at very high densities , but we ignore it here . )",
    "= 4.5truein    an ultraviolet background can radically alter this picture of cooling because photoionization dominates over collisional ionization in cold , low density gas .",
    "relative abundances depend on density , so the cooling rate is no longer strictly proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "one can nonetheless compute a `` cooling curve '' like figure  [ figeqcool ] for any specified density and uv background spectrum by assuming ionization equilibrium , a balance between destruction and ionization rates with photoionization taken into account ( see kwh for details ) . while ionization equilibrium does not hold during the epoch of reionization itself",
    ", it is thereafter an excellent approximation under most cosmologically relevant conditions ( vedel , hellsten & sommer - larsen 1994 ) .",
    "figure  [ figioncool ] shows cooling curves for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and a uv background @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the intensity at the lyman limit frequency @xmath27 in units of @xmath28 , equal to @xmath29 . at low densities ,",
    "the uv background photoionizes the hydrogen and helium , eliminating the excitation processes that dominate figure  [ figeqcool ] between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , the residual energy of photoelectrons heats the gas , and at low temperatures heating exceeds cooling . in figure",
    "[ figioncool ] , dotted lines show cooling rates , dashed lines heating rates , and solid lines the net cooling ( or heating ) rate @xmath32 .",
    "this net rate goes to zero at the temperature @xmath33 where the gas would reach radiative thermal equilibrium with the background , if other heating and cooling processes were unimportant .",
    "however , unlike ionization equilibrium , thermal equilibrium is rarely a good approximation under cosmological conditions , and in our numerical simulations we always integrate the thermal energy equation for each gas particle , using ionization equilibrium only to compute radiative cooling and heating rates as a function of density and temperature .    as the gas density increases , recombination begins to win out over photoionization .",
    "the hydrogen and helium excitation bumps reappear , and the cooling curve gradually returns to the collisional equilibrium form of figure  [ figeqcool ] . at low densities",
    "( e.g. , @xmath34 for the uv background used in figure  [ figeqcool ] ) the gas is almost fully ionized , and the curve @xmath35 again becomes independent of density .",
    "the cooling processes in this regime , recombination and free - free emission , are proportional to @xmath19 when the gas is fully ionized .",
    "the rate of photoelectric heating off the residual neutral atoms ( and singly ionized helium atoms ) is proportional to the densities of neutral ( and singly ionized ) atoms , which are themselves proportional to the recombination rates and hence to @xmath19 .",
    "changes in the uv background have predictable effects on the cooling curve . altering the intensity @xmath26 is equivalent to rescaling the gas density , e.g. , with @xmath25 and @xmath36 , figure  [ figeqcool ] would be exactly the same except that the @xmath37 curve would now correspond to @xmath38 , @xmath21 to @xmath22 , and so forth . if @xmath26 is kept fixed but the spectral _ shape _ is softened ( e.g. , @xmath39 instead of @xmath25 ) , then helium is photoionized less frequently than hydrogen , and the helium excitation bump returns more quickly than the hydrogen bump as density increases .",
    "in addition , the typical photoionization event is less energetic , so the heating rate and equilibrium temperature both drop . some of these effects are illustrated in the cooling curves of efstathiou ( 1992 ) and tw .",
    "the effects of photoionization on cooling of primordial gas are easily summarized . in low density gas , photoionization injects energy and eliminates the mechanisms that dominate cooling at moderate temperatures .",
    "the result can be an order - of - magnitude reduction in the cooling rate at temperatures as high as @xmath40 and a reversal of sign , from cooling to heating , at somewhat lower temperatures .",
    "these effects gradually become unimportant as the gas density increases . at @xmath17",
    ", gas is fully ionized by collisions alone , and photoionization has no impact on cooling rates .",
    "we began our study of photoionization by performing a set of low resolution simulations similar to those described by katz , hernquist , & weinberg ( 1992 ; hereafter khw ) and hernquist , katz , & weinberg ( 1995 ) , but including uv background fields of various intensities and spectral indices . in all cases ,",
    "we model the evolution of a periodic region in a standard cold dark matter universe , with @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and a baryon fraction @xmath43 .",
    "we normalize the cdm power spectrum so that the rms mass fluctuation in spheres of radius @xmath44 mpc is @xmath45 at redshift zero .",
    "this normalization yields a good match to the measured masses of rich galaxy clusters ( white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 ) , but when the spectrum is extrapolated to large scales it underproduces the level of microwave background anisotropies observed by cobe ( smoot et al .  1992 ; bunn , scott , & white 1995 ) . in this paper",
    "we are interested in generic physical effects in a hierarchical clustering theory of galaxy formation , not in the detailed predictions of a particular cdm model , so a normalization that produces the appropriate level of clustering on the scales of galaxy groups and clusters is better suited to our purposes .    in all cases",
    "our simulation volume is cube of comoving size 22.22 mpc .",
    "our low resolution models employ @xmath46 gas and @xmath46 dark matter particles , implying a mass per particle of @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the gas and dark matter , respectively .",
    "the simulations are evolved with treesph , using a fixed time step for the dark matter particles of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "the time steps for the gas particles , @xmath51 , are allowed to vary by powers of two so that the gas locally satisfies the courant condition , with the constraint that @xmath52 is always smaller than or equal to @xmath53 .",
    "spatial resolution is determined by the gravitational softening length , @xmath54 , which is 20 comoving kpc ( 13 kpc equivalent plummer softening ) , and by the smoothing lengths of the gas particles , which are updated continuously so that each smoothing volume contains 32 neighbors . to improve efficiency ,",
    "we do not allow any smoothing length to drop below @xmath55 , which implies that smoothed estimates for some particles in very overdense regions are calculated with more than 32 neighbors ( see , e.g. , evrard 1988 ; kwh ) .",
    "we include the effects of both compton and radiative cooling .    aside from an imposed floor on the gas particle",
    "smoothing lengths , the simulation with @xmath56 described in this section is identical in all respects to that in khw , except that here we include gas dynamical effects all the way to redshift zero instead of converting the gas to collisionless matter at @xmath57 .",
    "( the smoothing floor itself has virtually no effect on the results . )",
    "we also ran four low resolution simulations with an ionizing background for various combinations of the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath58 .",
    "specifically , for each of the choices @xmath59 and @xmath29 we consider spectral indices @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for a total of four additional simulations . in all cases",

    ", gravitational instability collects the dark matter and gas into a network of sheets , filaments , and clumps , interweaved with low density tunnels and rounded voids ( see , e.g. , figure 1 of khw ) .",
    "the combination of heating and cooling mechanisms leads to a a three - phase structure in the gas distribution .",
    "the gas in voids has low density and is either warm or cold depending on whether an ionizing background is included .",
    "the gas in overdense regions consists of extremely dense , radiatively cooled lumps close to the equilibrium temperature @xmath33 , orbiting within halos of moderately dense , shock heated material , typically at x - ray emitting temperatures .",
    "= 4.5truein    these features are illustrated in figure  [ figrhot ] , where we plot the temperatures and densities of all the gas particles at redshifts @xmath64 and 0 , for a simulation with no ionizing background ( @xmath65 ) and a simulation with a radiation field of intensity @xmath66 and spectral index @xmath61 . in the no - background  model ,",
    "the clump of particles centered on @xmath67 and @xmath68 at @xmath0 represents the cold gas in the underdense regions .",
    "this material continues to cool adiabatically as the universe expands ( and as voids grow in comoving volume ) , and by @xmath69 these particles are so cold that they no longer appear in the bottom - left panel of figure  [ figrhot ] .",
    "the hot , x - ray emitting gas phase consists of the particles in figure  [ figrhot ] at @xmath70 and typical overdensities of @xmath71 .",
    "the amount of this material increases with time as more and more gas falls into deep potential wells and is shock heated .",
    "the third phase , the dense , cool globs of gas that we associate with forming galaxies , resides in the thin `` ridge '' of particles lying at temperatures around @xmath30 k and extending to overdensities of nearly @xmath72 .",
    "the amount of very dense gas increases with time as new material cools and condenses into galaxies .    in broad terms , the evolution of the gas in the photoionized simulation is similar to that in the no - background  simulation , but there are two key differences . as is clearly visible in figure  [ figrhot ] , the low density gas in the underdense regions can not cool to arbitrarily low temperatures , since photoelectric heating steadily injects energy .",
    "nearly all of this gas remains ionized and resides at temperatures between @xmath73 and @xmath74k , occupying a locus where photoelectric heating balances adiabatic cooling .",
    "the other important difference between the two simulations  not so immediately obvious from figure  [ figrhot ]  is that the amount of gas in the very dense globs is greatly reduced when the uv background field is included .",
    "this difference suggests that an ionizing background could seriously influence the formation of even relatively massive galaxies .    to further investigate this last possibility , we identified potential sites of galaxy formation in each of our low resolution simulations using an adaptive version of the denmax algorithm formulated by gelb & bertschinger ( 1994ab ) . our new method ( skid ) , described in detail by stadel et al.(in preparation ; for the code and a description of its operation see http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/tools ) , employs the same general approach as denmax , associating particles with local density maxima and identifying gravitationally bound groups .",
    "however , skid computes densities and density gradients using spline kernel interpolation with a variable smoothing length instead of a grid of uniform cell spacing . to create a `` galaxy '' catalog",
    ", we select particles with @xmath75 and @xmath76k and allow skid to separate them into gravitationally bound objects .",
    "because this component of the gas is highly clumped , the galaxy population identified in this way is very robust ( see kwh ) .",
    "figures  [ figgalz2 ] and [ figgalzp5 ] show the spatial distributions of the galaxies in these low resolution simulations , at @xmath0 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "each galaxy is represented by a circle whose area is proportional to its baryonic mass .",
    "the number of galaxies @xmath78 and the mass fraction @xmath79 of cold gas in galaxies are indicated above each panel .",
    "= 4.5truein    = 4.5truein    photoionization dramatically influences the formation of dense globs of gas in our low resolution simulations . in all four cases with a background radiation field , the mass of cold , dense gas is greatly reduced compared to the no - background  model .",
    "few galaxies remain in any of the simulations with an ionizing background , and the amount of gas in this phase is reduced relative to that in the no - background  model by up to a factor of 4.5 at @xmath0 .",
    "new galaxies continue to form at lower redshifts , but at @xmath77 the number of galaxies remains a factor @xmath80 lower , depending on @xmath26 and @xmath58 .",
    "a comparison of the four cases indicates that the spectral index plays a more decisive role than the intensity in determining the suppression of galaxy formation .",
    "for example , the numbers and masses of galaxies in the two simulations with @xmath60 are nearly identical , while changing @xmath58 to 5 restores some of the galaxies seen in the no - background  model .",
    "we originally interpreted the results shown in figures  [ figgalz2 ] and [ figgalzp5 ] as evidence that photoionization by the uv background could suppress the formation of even relatively massive galaxies , with baryonic masses up to @xmath81 .",
    "since the virial temperatures of such systems are above the level @xmath82k where photoionization significantly alters cooling rates ( see figures  [ figeqcool ] and  [ figioncool ] ) , such an effect would have to be physically rather subtle , with photoionization either suppressing the formation of low mass clumps that would otherwise merge into big galaxies or `` hanging up '' the cooling process at intermediate temperatures in the more massive systems , allowing the gas to be shock heated back to high temperatures in later mergers .",
    "had these results been confirmed by higher resolution simulations , they would have implied that photoionization could easily solve the problem of an overabundance of low mass galaxies in hierarchical clustering models .",
    "indeed , the solution would be too good : unless the uv background spectrum were quite soft , it would be difficult to form any but the most massive galaxies , and the galaxy population would be sensitive to local variations in the uv background .",
    "while the sign of the effect indicated by figures  [ figgalz2 ] and [ figgalzp5 ] seems physically plausible , the magnitude is quite surprising .",
    "we were therefore concerned that these results might be an artifact of our limited numerical resolution , and we decided to repeat two of the calculations at higher resolution , evolving only to @xmath0 in order to avoid prohibitive computing costs .",
    "these simulations are identical in all respects to those with @xmath83 and with @xmath84 , @xmath60 , except that they have eight times more gas and dark matter particles , @xmath85 in each component .",
    "this change reduces the masses of individual gas and dark matter particles to @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively . to ease comparison with the low resolution simulations discussed above",
    ", we chose not to reduce the softening length , so that the spatial resolution is again limited to @xmath88 kpc ( comoving ) in the computation of gravitational forces and to @xmath89 for smoothed estimates of hydrodynamic properties .",

    "virtually all galaxies with baryonic mass @xmath92 in the no - background  simulation have a counterpart in the photoionized simulation with nearly the same position and nearly the same mass .",
    "some low mass galaxies are absent in the photoionized simulation , and the value of @xmath79 is reduced by about 10% . while the difference occurs in a mass range that is physically interesting , it may again be an artifact of limited resolution , now shifted to lower masses . in any event",
    ", this difference is much smaller than that seen in the two @xmath46 simulations , where photoionization reduced the number of galaxies by a factor of 10 and the amount of cold gas by a factor of 4.4 .",

    "the vast majority of the galaxies `` missing '' from the simulation with a background radiation field are of relatively low mass , with @xmath94 .",

    "third , the typical shift in position between matched pairs is @xmath99 kpc .",
    "finally , the masses of the galaxies in the matched pairs are in quite good agreement . the low resolution simulation yields slightly larger masses for the high mass galaxies , probably because it creates a single glob out of material that at high resolution breaks into a dominant system with small satellites .",
    "it yields slightly smaller masses for the low mass galaxies , probably because it underestimates the gas density and amount of cooling in the most poorly resolved objects .    from the galaxy distributions in figure  [ figgalres ]",

    "it is partly because of this complex interplay between microphysics and numerical resolution that we choose to treat the photoionizing background as an externally specified input to our simulations , instead of attempting to compute it self - consistently as done by cen & ostriker ( 1993 ) .",
    "one objective of hydrodynamic cosmological simulations is to predict the clustering of galaxies and the `` bias '' between galaxies and dark matter directly from _ ab initio _ theories of structure formation ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1992 ; khw ; evrard , summers , & davis 1994 ) . a major obstacle to this program",

    "1996 ) , it is essential to include a uv background because the gas that produces low column density absorption is highly photoionized .    if we adopt 32 sph particles as a nominal mass resolution limit , then the smallest resolved galaxies in our high resolution simulations have a total ( baryonic@xmath100dark ) mass of @xmath101 . in the spherical collapse model , a perturbation with this mass and a collapse redshift @xmath0 ( where our simulations stop )",
    "has a circular velocity @xmath102 km -2pt s@xmath103  ( see tw , equation 10 ) .",
    "our simulations indicate that photoionization has little or no influence on the efficiency of galaxy formation down to this circular velocity ; the small differences between our simulations with and without a uv background are probably the residual effect of finite numerical resolution .",
    "our conclusions about the impact of photoionization are consistent with those of steinmetz ( 1995 ) , qke , and tw , all of whom examined collapses of individual objects with resolution higher than that used here .",
    "qke performed 3-dimensional simulations using treesph , for a cdm model similar to that studied in this paper , but with @xmath104 instead of 0.7 and a uv background intensity @xmath105 .",
    "tw used a 1-dimensional code to simulate collapses of density peaks in spherical symmetry , at very high resolution , with a variety of parameters for the intensity , spectral shape , and evolution history of the uv background .",
    "the two studies reached remarkably similar conclusions : photoionization suppresses the formation of systems with @xmath106 km -2pt s@xmath103 , reduces the amount of cooled gas by about 50% for @xmath107 km -2pt s@xmath103 , and has progressively less effect towards higher circular velocities .",
    "the agreement between the two studies indicates that tw s results are not sensitive to their idealized geometry and that qke s results are not sensitive to their choice of uv background parameters or to their finite resolution .",
    "the simulations in this paper , which represent a much larger comoving volume , can not resolve systems of such low circular velocities , but they do show that no surprising new photoionization effects come into play during the hierarchical assembly of more massive galaxies .",
    "taken together , these studies suggest that photoionization alone will not solve the problem of excessive numbers of faint galaxies in the cdm model .",
    "kauffmann , guideroni & white ( 1994 ) , for example , find that star formation must be suppressed in halos with circular velocities up to 100 km -2pt",
    "s@xmath103  in order to achieve acceptable agreement with observations . as an alternative to photoionization by the ambient uv background",
    ", one can appeal to local feedback within star - forming systems ( dekel & silk 1986 ; white & frenk 1991 ; cole et al .",
    "1994 ; heyl et al .",
    "this mechanism can produce acceptable luminosity functions , but only if feedback suppresses the cooling of infalling gas very efficiently , perhaps unrealistically so . a third possibility , hinted at by a variety of recent studies ( e.g. , marzke , huchra & geller 1994 ; de propris et al .",
    "1995 ; ferguson & mcgaugh 1995 ) is that large numbers of faint galaxies are present in the real universe but are undercounted in conventional estimates of the luminosity function .",
    "finally , there is the possibility that our current theoretical pictures of galaxy and structure formation are missing an important basic ingredient .      for @xmath108 km -2pt s@xmath103",
    ", figures  [ figgalres][figgalmass ] show that simulations with sufficient numerical resolution yield similar galaxy populations with and without a uv background . in figure",
    "[ figgalphys ] , we show that this robustness to microphysical assumptions holds more broadly .",
    "panel ( a ) , repeated from figure  [ figgalres ] , displays the galaxy distribution at @xmath0 from the high resolution simulation with @xmath84 and @xmath25 .",
    "panel ( b ) shows a simulation that has the same initial conditions and uv background and includes star formation , using the algorithm described in kwh .",
    "galaxies are identified by applying skid to the combined distribution of star particles and cold , dense gas particles ( @xmath109 , @xmath110k ) ; the area of the circle representing a galaxy indicates its mass of stars plus cold , dense gas .",
    "the galaxy populations are nearly identical even though the first simulation treats the baryon component hydrodynamically throughout the calculation and the second simulation steadily converts cold , dense gas into collisionless particles and injects thermal energy from supernova feedback into the surrounding medium .",
    "figure 5 of kwh demonstrates similar insensitivity to assumptions about star formation in low resolution simulations with no uv background evolved to @xmath69 .",
    "the simulations illustrated in figures  [ figgalphys]a and  [ figgalphys]b both assume a simple @xmath111 spectrum for the uv background .",
    "figure  [ figgalphys]c shows a simulation with star formation and the uv background spectrum of haardt & madau ( 1996 ) , who compute the ambient radiation field that would be produced by the observed population of quasars after absorption and re - emission by the ly@xmath58 forest .",
    "we use their spectra for @xmath112 ( kindly provided by p.  madau ) to compute photoionization parameters and photoionization heating parameters as a function of redshift ( see  3 of kwh for formal definitions of these quantities ) .",
    "we reduce the amplitude of the spectrum by a factor of two so that the simulation roughly reproduces the observed mean ly@xmath58 opacity towards high-@xmath113 quasars ( press , rybicki & schneider 1993 ) for our adopted baryon density of @xmath43 . despite the changes in the spectral shape , intensity , and evolution of the uv background , the galaxy population in figure  [ figgalphys]c is almost indistinguishable from that in  [ figgalphys]b , except for the absence of a few of the smallest systems .",
    "the assumed uv background does influence the amount of ly@xmath58 absorption produced by intergalactic hydrogen , but the effect enters mainly through a single parameter , the background intensity weighted by photoionization cross - section ( @xmath114 in the notation of kwh ) .    figure  [ figgalphys]d shows the galaxy population from a similar cdm model , but with the power spectrum normalized to @xmath115 , close to the level implied by cobe .",
    "we again incorporate star formation and the haardt & madau ( 1996 ) ionizing background spectrum . while the overall structure of the galaxy distribution is similar in this simulation ( the initial fluctuations were increased in amplitude but otherwise unaltered ) , the largest galaxies are considerably more massive .",
    "there are also a number of low mass galaxies present in this model that have not formed by this redshift in the lower normalization simulation .",
    "the galaxy mass functions for the three @xmath116 simulations are nearly identical , but the mass function for the @xmath115 simulation is shifted systematically towards higher masses .",
    "our results show that numerical resolution is important for studying galaxy formation in simulations like these , and that the required resolution can depend on the microphysical treatment in a complicated way .",
    "they also suggest that there are critical regimes where a small change in resolution can produce a major , qualitative change in results , by shifting a simulation from a regime where gas in a typical halo can cool to a regime where it can not .",
    "figure  [ figgalphys ] adds an encouraging coda to this disconcerting story : when the numerical resolution is adequate , the simulated galaxy population is insensitive to uncertain microphysical assumptions , at least within the range that we have examined here . the one model that stands out in figure  [ figgalphys ]",
    "is the one with a different primordial fluctuation amplitude , and it is easily distinguished from the others .",
    "simulations that model galaxy formation in a large volume to @xmath69 will be computationally demanding , but we can expect them to provide good constraints on theories of the origin of cosmic structure .",
    "we acknowledge valuable discussions with jeremiah ostriker , tom quinn , martin rees , anne thoul , and simon white .",
    "we thank piero madau for providing us with the haardt & madau ( 1996 ) uv background spectrum and for helpful discussions about the uv background .",
