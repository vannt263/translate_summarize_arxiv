    "the phenomenological implications of vector - like theories depend crucially on the details of the precise theory in question .",
    "precision electroweak constraints depend on masses and couplings to vector bosons , flavor constraints depend on their flavor mixings with sm fermions , direct detection constraints depend on mass hierarchies and the size of the couplings and mixings to sm states that enable prompt or non - prompt decays into various model - specific final state ratios .",

    "our aim was to demonstrate all of these features through examples and extensive computations .",

    "in our investigations we have shown that the addition of vector - like fermions with vector - like masses less than a few tev , and with chiral couplings to the higgs boson , leads to tens of percent shifts in higgs production ( @xmath177 ) and decay ( @xmath178 ) observables . in time , measurements of higgs observables and direct searches for vector - like states will go far to confirm or exclude this possibility near the weak scale .    _",
