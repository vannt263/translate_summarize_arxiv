    "<S> the building block of all of the lithium subhydrides is an li@xmath2h cluster , which can be thought of as a superalkali . </S>",
    "<S> the geometries and electronic structures of these phases is analogous to that of the well  known alkali metal suboxides .    </S>",
    "<S> considerable attention has been given towards the pressure  induced synthesis of hydrogen  rich systems with unusual stoichiometries due to their potential import in energy applications , and because they may provide routes towards hydrogen s metallization and concomitant superconductivity.@xcite a number of intriguing systems which exhibit strong intermolecular interactions under pressure , including the van der waals solids xe - h@xmath3,@xcite ch@xmath4-h@xmath3,@xcite sih@xmath4-h@xmath3,@xcite and h@xmath3s - h@xmath3,@xcite have been prepared . pressure  </S>",

    "<S> recently , we have shown that under pressure the alkali metal polyhydrides , mh@xmath5 with @xmath6 , become stable with respect to decomposition into mh and h@xmath3 at 100 , 25 , and 2  gpa for lithium,@xcite sodium,@xcite , and rubidium , @xcite respectively . </S>",
    "<S> lih@xmath5 is particularly interesting because the most stable structure above 150  gpa , lih@xmath7 , was found to be metallic already at 1  atm.@xcite elemental lithium also exhibits unusual behavior : when compressed its melting temperature initially decreases so that between 40 - 60  gpa it has the lowest melting point among the elemental metals . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite these reasons prompted us to computationally explore the alkali  </S>",
    "<S> metal / hydrogen phase diagram further , specifically its lithium  rich region . </S>",
    "<S> even though the structures we find , some of which are illustrated in figure  [ fig : figure1 ] , show no evidence for significant metallicity or low  temperature melting behavior , they hint that pressure may be used to synthesize a new class of compounds whose atomic and electronic structures are remarkably similar to the well  known rubidium and cesium suboxides.@xcite because of the similarities described below , we refer to these phases as lithium subhydrides .    </S>",
    "<S> h structures found between 50 - 100  gpa and ( b ) the chain  like building blocks common to both systems . </S>",
    "<S> these chains are made up of ( c ) li@xmath2h clusters which are fused at the faces as illustrated in ( d ) by the li@xmath8 atoms . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1 ] ]    the open  source evolutionary algorithm ( ea ) _ xtalopt _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has been employed to find low enthalpy structures of li@xmath0h with @xmath9 up to @xmath10  100  gpa.@xcite the calculated enthalpies of formation , @xmath11 , of the most favorable structures for a given stoichiometry are provided in figure  [ fig : figure2](a ) . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , the formation of lih from lithium and molecular hydrogen is preferred up to at least 350 gpa @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our computations predict that two different li@xmath13h phases , one with @xmath14 ( space group # 36 ) and one with @xmath15 ( space group # 39 ) symmetry ( see figure  [ fig : figure1](a ) ) , are particularly stable in the sense that they have the most negative enthalpies of formation between 50100  gpa , a pressure range which coincides with the metal  to  semiconductor transition @xcite and the low melting point @xcite observed in pure lithium . both structures </S>",

    "<S> phonon calculations confirm that both are mechanically stable within the harmonic approximation at 90  gpa and have the same zero  point energy . beyond 180  gpa a li@xmath3h stoichiometry which is best described as a cscl structure with missing hydrogen atoms has a lower @xmath11 , but since this is also a region where lithium polyhydrides are stabilized,@xcite we will focus our discussion on @xmath16 .     </S>",

    "<S> is found in the nacl structure . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2 ] ]    structurally , all of the li@xmath0h with @xmath19 are related to each other through common motifs : li@xmath2h cluster  like building blocks . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrogen atom lies near the center of these clusters and the lithium atoms make up the vertices of their enclosing polyhedra , the faces of one such polyhedron are colored red in figure  [ fig : figure1](c ) . the most common cluster s geometric structure , which resembles a previously studied li@xmath20h cluster,@xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : figure1](c ) , as extracted directly from the li@xmath13h extended system . it is present in all of the structures except for @xmath21.@xcite this @xmath22symmetry polyhedron has 11 faces ( 10 triangular and 1 rectangular ) and is best described as a distorted bicapped trigonal antiprism . </S>",
    "<S> note that two opposing li - li distances on its `` rectangular '' base are distorted such that there is no c@xmath3 axis in this cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> the li@xmath2h unit is also qualitatively similar to the most stable li@xmath2b isomer found in an extensive investigation of li@xmath0b clusters.@xcite a [ li@xmath7b]@xmath23 cluster was found to be particularly stable relative to the rest and was noted to correspond to a closed electronic shell ( magic number ) within the phenomenological shell model,@xcite as does [ li@xmath2h]@xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> we found this important because the building blocks of the suboxides , rb@xmath20o@xmath3 and cs@xmath24o@xmath25 , have been compared to giant alkali metal ( superalkali ) atoms which may combine with excess metal atoms yielding a type of intermetallic compound.@xcite the neutral building block of the subhydrides , li@xmath2h , has the correct electron count ( @xmath26 ) so that it can be thought of as a superalkali atom , a cluster with one more electron than a magic number ( eight in this case ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , interstitial lithium and/or hydrogen atoms ( atoms which do not belong to a li@xmath2h building block ) are observed in li@xmath0h with @xmath27 ( see figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : figure3](b ) and ( c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the extended systems predicted in this work have both structural and electronic similarities to the suboxides . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly rare  </S>",
    "<S> earth halide cluster complexes almost always possess an endohedral atom as well.@xcite    li@xmath13h and ( b ) li@xmath7h at 90  gpa . </S>",
    "<S> the fused polyhedron pairs in li@xmath28h at 90  gpa are shown in ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3 ] ]    in li@xmath13h , the li@xmath2h clusters are fused at the faces in a chain  like arrangement , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : figure3](a ) ; the two li@xmath13h phases only differ in the relative stacking of the chains ( see figure  [ fig : figure1](a , b ) ) . li@xmath25h and li@xmath7h are constructed in a similar fashion , except in li@xmath7h the polyhedra are fused via edges and vertices ( see figure   [ fig : figure3](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , li@xmath4h can also be thought of as a network of edge and vertex  sharing clusters . </S>",
    "<S> li@xmath0h with @xmath18=79 are made up of pairs of face  sharing polyhedra , as illustrated for li@xmath28h in figure  [ fig : figure3](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the range of li@xmath0h structures we considered ( all of which are predicted to be thermodynamically unstable with respect to decomposition into li@xmath13h and li / lih ) can all be represented as arrangemnts of li@xmath2h building blocks with lithium atoms possibly in the interstital regions .    </S>",
    "<S> here lies the most striking similarity to the alkali metal suboxides : a structural one . </S>",
    "<S> the suboxides basic building blocks , rb@xmath20o@xmath3 and cs@xmath24o@xmath25 , are formed from two rb@xmath7o or three cs@xmath7o octahedra ; they are similar to the fused polyhedron pairs shown in figure  [ fig : figure3](c ) and are the only constituents of the simplest suboxides . </S>",
    "<S> different stoichiometries , such as rb@xmath7o = rb@xmath20o@xmath29rb@xmath25 and cs@xmath28o = cs@xmath24o@xmath30cs@xmath31 , are made up of the same basic units with excess rb or cs atoms interspersed between them , like li@xmath28h discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying octahedra can also be fused such that they form chains in more complex subnitrides or suboxoindates , such as naba@xmath25n @xcite or cs@xmath20ino@xmath20,@xcite just like li@xmath13h .    in analogy to the suboxides and subnitrides </S>",
    "<S> , one can assume that because of the large electronegativity difference between lithium and hydrogen , the lithium subhydrides can be thought of as ( li@xmath23)@xmath0(h@xmath32)@xmath33(e@xmath32)@xmath34 , exhibiting ionic bonding on the inside and metallic bonding on the outside of the fused li@xmath2h clusters yielding an overall metallic character . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated bader charges of -0.96 on the hydrides and + 0.68 on the lithium atoms agree with the ionic bonding , and the ubiquitous presence of the li@xmath2h building blocks suggests strong intra  cluster atomic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the dos of the two li@xmath13h phases at 60 and 90  gpa show these are semimetals or are weakly metallic , see figure  [ fig : figure4](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the existence of two iso  </S>",
    "<S> enthalpic li@xmath13h phases suggests that , like the suboxides , the bonding between the chains is weak .     </S>",
    "<S> li@xmath13h at 90  gpa ( solid line ) and 60  gpa ( dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dos plots for @xmath15 li@xmath13h are qualitatively similar and are given in the si . </S>",
    "<S> the left and right plots have different scales . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the site  projected densities of states ( pdos ) onto the li@xmath8 and li@xmath35 atoms in @xmath14li@xmath13h at 90  gpa . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi energy , @xmath36 , is set to zero . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure4 ] ]    under pressure the valence bands of li@xmath13h narrow slightly , the semi  core ( sub  valence ) bands do not change much , and the core li @xmath37 bands broaden , much like in elemental lithium . also like lithium , the density of states near the fermi energy , @xmath36 , has mostly li @xmath38 character . </S>",
    "<S> however , at 60  gpa li@xmath13h has a lower dos at @xmath36 than li@xmath39 and at 90  gpa the subhydrides remain semimetallic but li@xmath40 is a semi - conductor . </S>",
    "<S> the band  structure of @xmath14li@xmath13h in figure  [ fig : figure5](a ) shows that along the high  symmetry lines two conical  like bands , with a linear dispersion , cross @xmath36 . in @xmath15li@xmath13h </S>",
    "<S> the band crossing occurs slightly above @xmath36 , so this phase is somewhat more metallic .    </S>",
    "<S> the bands lying between -9 and -6 ev are primarily hydridic , but some lithium character is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the li@xmath8 atoms , which belong to a face that is shared between two adjacent li@xmath2h clusters , contribute more than the li@xmath35 to the low energy portion of the sub  valence bands , as shown in the pdos in figure  [ fig : figure4](b ) . in order to investigate this further </S>",
    "<S> , a wannier function ( wf ) was constructed which describes these bands almost perfectly ( see the si ) using the @xmath41mto method.@xcite this wf , shown in figure  [ fig : figure5](b ) , consists of a sphere centered on the central h@xmath32 with @xmath38like tails on the surrounding lithium atoms , indicative of hybridization between the two . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this wf is reminiscent of a @xmath37 superatom orbital in a [ li@xmath2h]@xmath23 cluster with the same geometry as the building block used to construct the li@xmath13h phase ( see the si ) . </S>",
    "<S> it also shows that the bonding within the cluster is primarily ionic in nature .    </S>",
    "<S> [ h ! ]    </S>",
    "<S> li@xmath13h at 90  gpa , ( b ) the wannier function which yields the two sets of bands between -9 and -6 ev ( isovalue@xmath42  0.04  @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the bohr radius ) , and ( c ) an elf=0.87 isosurface . in ( c ) , the two characteristic maxima in the interstitial region of the lattice are labelled m1 and m2 and are shown in greater detail in the si . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure5 ] ]    we note that even though the wf which describes the sub  valence band of li@xmath13h in figure  [ fig : figure5](b ) is reminiscent of a superatom @xmath45orbital , the valence dos can not easily be understood using such a picture . to extend the analogy </S>",
    "<S> , the remaining occupied bands would need to be described by superatom @xmath38like states . </S>",
    "<S> chain  like cluster arrangments of li@xmath2h , such as li@xmath46h@xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> , do qualitatively behave as such ( see the si ) , but we will show below that the comparison of the li@xmath0h phases with the suboxides ( and high  pressure lithium ) is perhaps a stronger one .    </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the electron localization function ( elf ) is high around the hydridic atoms . </S>",
    "<S> there are , however , two characteristic pockets of increased electron density , labelled m1 and m2 , with peak elf values near 0.91 between the chains ( see figure  [ fig : figure5](c ) ) that can be attributed to the metallic bands . </S>",
    "<S> the elf profile of the @xmath15li@xmath13h structure is similar and is consistent with the localization of valence electron density in the interstitial regions noted in pure compressed lithium.@xcite the integrated charge densities within the m1/m2 basins ( the charge density maxima identified from the bader analysis ) are 0.74/0.84 electrons in both li@xmath13h structures , notably smaller than the 1 - 2 electron occupancies in the recently proposed @xmath47 - 40 structure for the pure li@xmath40 phase found experimentally at 90  gpa ; this is suggestive that li@xmath13h is more metallic,@xcite as expected . </S>",
    "<S> however , the elf between two m2 basins reaches values as high as 0.74 , and the elf between m1 and m2 does not exceed 0.68 . the difference between these elf values and the basins peak elf values of 0.91 may be suggestive of poor conductivity,@xcite also as expected </S>",
    "<S> .    the localization of metallic electrons in the areas between the chains are also characteristic of the suboxides.@xcite it is interesting to note that the m1 site shown in figure  [ fig : figure5](c ) is actually in the same local chemical environment as the hydrogen atoms . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the li atoms around the site form the same exohedral structure as they do in the li@xmath2h cluster discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> given that the 0.74 electrons assigned to the m1 site is comparable to the -0.96 charge assigned to the hydrides , this provides another trait ( beyond the 1dimensional behavior of the hydridic bands ) which is unique to li@xmath13h among the li@xmath0h we considered : it allows the m1 sites , or `` pseudo - anions '' , to be encapsulated in the same way as the hydrides . </S>",
    "<S> this also provides a simple physical link between the two li@xmath13h structures in the sense that they only differ in how the chains of hydrides and m1 sites are arranged about the lattice ; in the @xmath14 structure they are distributed homogeneously while in @xmath15 structure they are arranged into layers . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical difference between the li@xmath8 and the li@xmath35 atoms is that the former bridge two hydrides , whereas the latter bridge two m1 sites .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> evolutionary algorithm searches coupled with first  </S>",
    "<S> principles computations predict that a new hydrogen  poor class of compounds , the lithium subhydrides ( li@xmath0h with @xmath48 ) become stable with respect to decomposition into lih and li at @xmath49  50  gpa . </S>",
    "<S> this stabilization occurs at pressures lower than those necessary to form their polyhydride counterparts.@xcite all of the subhydrides are composed of superalkali , li@xmath2h , building blocks and exhibit ionic bonding on the inside of these clusters and metallic bonding in the interstitial regions between them . </S>",
    "<S> analogies were drawn between the geometries and electronic structures of the phases predicted in this work and the well  known alkali metal suboxides.@xcite the most favorable stoichiometry , li@xmath13h , manifested in two iso  </S>",
    "<S> enthalpic phases which did not exhibit any imaginary phonon modes at 90  gpa . </S>",
    "<S> we find the most unique aspects of li@xmath13h relative to the other li@xmath0h structures we considered to be their thermodynamic and mechanical stability , the mixing of hydridic states with lithium states to create subvalence 1-d chain - like electronic behavior , and ordered li cages around `` pseudo - anion''like pockets of electron density resulting in a high symmetry li sublattice relative to the other subhydride structures . </S>",
    "<S> although we have not yet considered finite temperature effects nor the kinetic barriers required to break up their would - be precursors ( li or lih ) , their enthalpic and mechanical stabilities suggest they may potentially be made in high  pressure experiments . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , these results hint that there may be other novel stoichiometries of subhydrides to be explored under pressure and , perhaps , other lithium - rich or suboxide materials . </S>"
