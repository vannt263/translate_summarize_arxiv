    "the anchoring phenomenon is the tendency of a liquid crystal to orient in a particular direction when in contact with the container walls .",
    "the equilibrium director orientation set by the interaction of the liquid crystal with the aligning surface is called an _ easy orientation axis_. the simplest , strong anchoring , assumption is that the director has a fixed orientation at the boundaries along the easy orientation axis .",
    "however , it has been discovered that the coupling of the director with the orienting surface can be rather weak .",
    "this results in deviation of the surface director from the easy axis in response to small perturbations .    on a phenomenological level , weak",
    "anchoring can be described by adding an appropriate _ surface potential _ to the free energy of the system .",
    "then minimization of the free energy functional gives both the equations for the director in the bulk and the appropriate boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the simplest form of the surface potential has been proposed by rapini and papoular @xcite @xmath0 where the parameter , @xmath1 , is termed an anchoring energy .    since then , numerous experimental methods have been used to measure the surface anchoring coefficient @xmath1 @xcite ; its value has turned out to be extremely important for liquid crystal devices , i.e. displays , optical switches .",
    "however , comparatively little work on systematic experimental investigation of the anchoring phenomenon has been presented up till now . from the available experimental data",
    ", one can say that the extrapolation length @xmath2 is inversely proportional to the squared value of the bulk order parameter @xmath3 . taking into account that the elastic constant @xmath4 is typically proportional to @xmath5 , this gives for the anchoring parameter @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to estimate the anchoring coefficient theoretically @xcite and by combining molecular simulation with a local density functional approach @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty here is that one needs to know the direct pair correlation function of the nematic state , which is usually unknown , and must hence be estimated with some uncontrolled approximations or assumptions ( see , however , ref .",
    "moreover , it is often assumed that the director in the interface region is fixed @xcite .",
    "however , it has already been noticed that these approximations may give incorrect results , by at least an order of magnitude , for example in the calculation of bulk elastic constants @xcite .",
    "similar studies have also been done using lattice models .",
    "the existence of subsurface deformations and effective intrinsic anchoring arising from the incomplete molecular interaction close to the surface has been studied using a hexagonal lattice approach @xcite .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of the lebwohl - lasher model have shown that the extrapolation length is not in general equal to the ratio of the bulk to surface couplings @xcite . however , the results were not sufficiently robust to determine the dependence of the anchoring energy on the order parameter .",
    "the present work attempts to remedy the situation by combining the elastic description with onsager theory and monte carlo simulation results .",
    "we study the dependence of the elastic ( @xmath4 ) and surface anchoring ( @xmath1 ) coefficients on the liquid crystal state point , which is defined by the bulk value of the order parameter @xmath7 .",

    "section [ sec : simulation ] gives details of the technique used in monte carlo simulations and the results are summarized in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the easiest way to obtain the surface anchoring coefficient @xmath1 is to create a director deformation far from the surface .",
    "then , measuring the response of the director near the cell surface , or fitting the director profile with a theoretically predicted profile , yields an estimate of the anchoring extrapolation length and ratios of the elastic constants .",

    "eqn  ( [ int_dir ] ) is not valid for every @xmath102 , in spite of the derivation .",
    "this is because we are trying to map the single - particle density variation onto the director variation ( eqn  [ dens_perturb ] ) .",

    "therefore we can expand it in a taylor series @xmath107 and restrict ourselves to second order in the expansion .",

    "expansion coefficients of the excluded area , @xmath112 , are even functions of @xmath20 , which immediately implies that @xmath113 in the bulk , since the integrated function @xmath114 is odd ( because @xmath115 is zero in the bulk , we expanded @xmath116 up to second order ) .    to prove that @xmath117 in the bulk , we consider again the equation for the single particle density ( [ dens_onsager ] ) . performing the usual expansion of density and @xmath50-function",

    "it is easy to show that the left hand side of the second equation in ( [ bulk_dens_eq ] ) equals @xmath121 in the cell bulk . indeed , using the symmetry of the excluded volume expansion coefficients we can write @xmath122 , which converts the expression for @xmath121 to the left hand side of the second equation in ( [ bulk_dens_eq ] ) .",
    "in fact , the conclusion @xmath117 in the cell bulk is a consequence of the invariance of the grand potential with respect to director rotations .",
    "therefore , eqn  ( [ dir_eq ] ) in the cell bulk reduces to @xmath123 which means we have a linear dependence of the director on @xmath20 coordinate , in agreement with the result of elastic theory ( [ el_lin ] ) .",
    "this also means that , in the cell bulk , @xmath124 is an eigenvector of the fredholm equation ( [ int_dir ] ) .    to solve eqn  ( [ int_dir ] ) near the cell boundary is a much more challenging task .",
    "numerically it can be done using , for example , an iterative method @xcite . here",
    "we try to construct a crude analytical solution which will give us some qualitative understanding of what is happening in the interface region .    to begin with ,",
    "we simplify eqn  ( [ int_dir ] ) .",
    "the sum over @xmath125 in the right - hand side of eqn  ( [ int_dir ] ) is converging very fast ( for ellipsoids with the elongation @xmath126 , every term is about ten times smaller than the previous one ) .",
    "therefore , we truncate the sum leaving only the @xmath127 term . then , the kernel of the fredholm equation @xmath128 can be expanded in a taylor series @xmath129 where @xmath130 are some functions .",
    "a practical example of such an expansion is given in appendix [ sec : hermite ] .",
    "the kernel is then separable , and the problem is reduced to the solution of a set of linear algebraic equations . indeed , substituting eqn ( [ sep_krnl ] ) into eqn  ( [ int_dir ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath131 where the @xmath132 are some constants . substituting ( [ dir_int ] ) back into eqn  ( [ int_dir ] ) we obtain an infinite set of linear equations for the coefficients @xmath132 . to obtain an analytical expression ,",
    "we perform further simplifications .",
    "first we note that , in the cell bulk , the director is a linear function of the @xmath20 coordinate .",
    "therefore , to a good approximation , we may retain only the first two terms in eqn  ( [ int_dir ] ) since in the cell bulk @xmath133 .",
    "using again the director profile given by elastic theory , eqn  ( [ el_lin ] ) , we obtain an expression for the extrapolation length @xmath134 this expression is able to give qualitative explanations of the anchoring phenomenon in our system . in the ideal case , often considered in phenomenological approaches @xcite , the density and order parameter",
    "are assumed to be constant in the cell , i.e. @xmath135 . the anchoring appears only due to the presence of the interface , which breaks translational symmetry . according to eqn  ( [ bulk_dens_eq ] ) , @xmath136 , therefore @xmath137 .",
    "then the anchoring coefficient is proportional to the first moment of the excluded area coefficient @xmath138 @xmath139 and does not depend on the value of density or order parameter , since excluded area , as well as excluded volume , are completely defined by the geometry of the overlapping molecules .",
    "this means that in the ideal case of a uniform nematic , the anchoring coefficient @xmath140 has the same dependence on the order parameter as the elastic constant @xmath4 .    in reality",
    ", one observes rather strong subsurface variations of the density and order parameter .",
    "the ratio @xmath141 then comes into play and contributes to the overall dependence of the extrapolation length on the order parameter .",
    "the numerical results which show this dependence are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : onsager_slab ] .",
    "a simple physical explanation is also possible .",
    "presmectic ordering and higher density of the nematic phase in the interface region indicate that the nematic liquid crystal is at different state point .",
    "the mesophase is more ordered at this state point and this ordering is less sensitive to the density variation in the cell bulk . since this ordering defines the director profile at the interface , it also affects the dependence of the extrapolation length on the state point .",
    "another simulation method to measure bulk elastic constants @xmath142 and the zenithal anchoring energy @xmath1 is based on the measurement of the director fluctuation amplitudes @xmath143 in the liquid crystal cell @xcite .",
    "consider again slab geometry with homeotropic anchoring of the director at both cell surfaces .",
    "consider a small perturbation of the director around the equilibrium distribution @xmath144 minimizing the free energy ( [ free_energy ] ) and linearizing the equations for the director and boundary conditions with respect to @xmath145 , we obtain    @xmath146    @xmath147    here we adopt the notation @xmath148 .",

    "the wave vectors @xmath155 form a discrete spectrum because of confinement in the @xmath20 direction which depends on the anchoring energy @xmath1 .",
    "the explicit form of the @xmath155 spectrum is given by the secular equation : @xmath156    in molecular simulations , rather than measuring director fluctuations , it is more convenient to measure fluctuations of the second - rank order tensor components ( following ref .",
    "we define the real - space order tensor density @xmath157 where @xmath158 , in terms of the orientation vectors @xmath159 of each molecule @xmath160 ( we consider only uniaxial molecules ) .",

    "both the permitted @xmath171 spectrum , and the variation of @xmath172 with @xmath173 , are sensitive to the anchoring strength parameter @xmath174 .",

    ", it should be borne in mind that simulation results are model specific , however the advantage of using systems of hard ellipsoids is that they exhibit a simple phase behaviour with some resemblance of that of real nematogens .",
    "in addition , as the elongation increases , the nematic - isotropic phase boundary approaches the onsager limit .",
    "this eases the comparison between simulation and density - functional onsager - type theories .",
