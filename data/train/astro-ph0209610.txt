    "a generalization of einstein general relativity can be obtained by considering a torsion tensor different from zero in @xmath1 space - time manifold where connection is not symmetric @xcite .",
    "such an approach is very interesting today in relation to several extended theories of gravity as superstrings , supergravity and kaluza - klein theories . in particular",
    ", torsion allows to include spin matter fields in general relativity and the einstein - cartan - sciama - kibble ( ecks ) theory is one of most serious attempt in this direction . however , not all the forms of torsion are directly connected to a spin counterpart as it is widely discussed in @xcite .",
    "now if some forms of torsion allow to take into account spin in general relativity , it seems reasonable that they could have had some role into dynamics of the early universe when the number density of particles per volume was huge .",
    "the presence of torsion gives naturally a repulsive contribution to the energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is possible to show that for densities of the order of @xmath2 for electrons and @xmath3 for protons and neutrons , torsion could give observable consequences if all the spins of the particles result aligned . these huge densities can be reached only in the early universe so that cosmology is the only viable approach to test torsion effects @xcite .",
    "however no relevant tests confirming the presence of torsion have been found until now and it is still an open debate if the space - time is a riemannian @xmath4 manifold or not .",
    "considering cosmology and , in particular primordial phase transitions and inflation @xcite , it seems very likely that , in some regions of early universe , the presence of local magnetic fields could have aligned the spins of particles . at very high densities , this effect could influence the evolution of primordial perturbations remaining as an imprint in today observed large scale structures .",
    "> from another point of view , the presence of torsion could give observable effects without taking into account clustered matter but resulting as a sort of cosmological constant .",
    "recent observations seem to point out that the universe is accelerating .",
    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite , data coming from clusters of galaxies @xcite and cmbr investigations @xcite give observational constraints from which we deduce that the universe is spatially flat , low density and dominated by some kind of non - clustered dark energy .",
    "such an energy , which is supposed to have dynamics , should be the origin of the observed cosmic acceleration .    in terms of density parameter",
    ", we have @xmath5 where @xmath6 includes non - relativistic baryonic and non - baryonic ( dark ) matter , @xmath0 is the dark energy ( cosmological constant , quintessence , .. ) , @xmath7 is the curvature parameter of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric .",
    "standard matter fluid as source of einstein ",
    "friedmann cosmological equations gives rise to expanding decelerated dynamics .",
    "to fit observations , non - standard forms of matter - energy have to be taken into account : the net effect should be to implement a sort of a _ cosmological constant _ which naturally gives rise to a negative pressure capable of implementing an accelerated cosmic expansion . on the other hand , _ quintessence _",
    "@xcite generalizes this approach taking into account all the mechanisms which give rise to negative pressure regimes for cosmic fluid . in particular , scalar fields .",
    "the cosmological constant problem is one of the main issue of modern physics since its value should provide the gravity vacuum state @xcite , should be connected to the mechanism which led the early universe to the today observed large scale structures @xcite , and should predict what will be the fate of the whole universe ( no  hair conjecture ) @xcite .    in any case , we need a time variation of cosmological constant to get successful inflationary models , to be in agreement with observations , and to obtain a de sitter stage toward the future . in other words",
    ", this means that cosmological constant has to acquire a great value in early epoch , it has to undergo a phase transition with a graceful exit and has to result in a small remnant toward the future coinciding with the observational constraints _ ( coincidence problem)_.    the today observed accelerated cosmological behaviour should be the result of this dynamical process where the present value of cosmological constant is not fixed exactly at zero .    in this context ,",
    "a fundamental issue is to select the classes of gravitational theories and conditions which `` naturally '' allow to recover an effective cosmological constant without considering special initial data .",
    "theories with torsion could match up this point , as we will see below , also if the coincidence problem ( that is the fine tuning between huge initial values of @xmath0 and very thin today observed constraints ) remain essentially unsolved .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec.2 is devoted to an essential summary of gravity with torsion . in sec.3 , we show how introducing torsion in cosmological dynamics gives rise to a negative pressure extra - term acting as a cosmological constant and we found a general cosmological solution . in sec.4 , we match such a cosmological solution with data coming from sne ia surveys and sunyaev - zeldovich / x - ray method .",
    "sec.5 is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this section , we give general definitions of torsion and associated quantities .",
    "we shall use the notation in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "it is a convention to call * u*@xmath8 a @xmath9-dimensional space - time manifold endowed with metric and torsion .",
    "the manifolds with metric and without torsion are labeled as * v*@xmath8 .",
    "torsion tensor @xmath10 can be defined , in a @xmath1 space - time manifold , using the antisymmetric part of the affine connection coefficients @xmath11 , that is [ t1 ] s_ab^c=(_ab^c-_ba^c ) _ [ ab]^c , where @xmath12 .    in einstein general relativity",
    ", it is postulated that @xmath13 .    often in the calculations , torsion occurs in linear combinations as in the _ contortion tensor _ , defined as [ t3 ]",

    "c^ba= , is the source of torsion . in many instances ,",
    "it can be identified with a spin density , but there are many cases in which the source of the torsion field is not spin @xcite .    by the full variation of ( [ t6 ] ) and introducing the canonical energy - momentum tensor @xmath23 where we used the abridged notation @xmath24 , the following field equations are derived @xcite @xmath25 and [ t10 ] t_ab^c=8g_ab^c , where @xmath26 , and the symbol @xmath27 indicates covariant derivative with torsion .",
    "eqs.([t9 ] ) generalize the einstein equations in a @xmath28 .",
    "eqs.([t10 ] ) are algebraic so that it is always possible to cast eqs.([t9 ] ) in pure einstein ones , by substituting the torsion terms with their sources .",
    "the result is the definition of an effective energy ",
    "momentum tensor as the source of the riemannian part of the einstein tensor @xcite . in doing so",
    ", one obtains    [ t11 ] g^ab(\\{})=8g^ab ,    where @xmath29 is the riemannian part of the einstein tensor . the effective energy ",
    "momentum tensor is then    [ t12 ] ^ab&=&^ab+ 8 g .",

    "fluid matter is considered .",
    "these considerations are extremely useful for the following , since torsion contributions can be treated as additional perfect - fluid terms .",
    "the totally antisymmetric part of torsion can be expressed by a 4-vector ^a=^abcds_bcd .",
    "if one imposes to it the symmetries of a background which is homogeneous and isotropic , it follows that , in comoving coordinates , only the component @xmath31 survives as a function depending only on cosmic time ( see @xcite ) .    for a perfect fluid",

    "can be assumed in the forms @xcite    [ density ] = + f^2 , p= p -f^2 ,    where @xmath34 is a function related to @xmath31 , while @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the usual quantities of general relativity .",
    "this choice can be pursued since we can define @xmath37}=f(t)$ ] where @xmath38 is a generic function of time which we consider as the source of torsion . for a detailed discussion of this point see @xcite    as above",
    ", we can define a stress - energy tensor of the form ^(tot)_ab=(+)u_au_b - g_ab , which , by eqs .",
    "( [ density ] ) , can be splitted as ^(tot)_ab=^(matter)_ab+^(torsion)_ab . due to the contracted bianchi identity",

    "> from eqs.([bianchi1 ] ) , both sides of ( [ continuity ] ) vanish independently so that f(t)=f_0= in other worlds , a torsion field gives rise to a constant energy density .",
    "taking into account standard matter whose equation of state is defined into the above zeldovich range , we obtain    [ dense ] = _ 0 ^ 3(+1)+f_0 ^ 2 .    inserting this result into the cosmological equations , we obtain , in any case , a monotonic expansion being @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "we obtain an accelerated behaviour if [ acceleration ] + 3p<2f_0 ^ 2 , so that acceleration depends on the torsion density .    in a dust - dominated universe",
    ", we have [ dust ] = _ 0()^3+f_0 ^ 2 , = -f_0 ^ 2,and then the general solution is [ general ] a(t)=()^1/3 ^1/3 .    obviously , if @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 and then @xmath43 , as it has to be .",
    "this results tell us that a @xmath0-term can be obtained without considering additional scalar fields in the dynamics but only assuming that the space - time is @xmath1 ( a manifold with torsion ) instead of @xmath4 ( the standard riemann manifold of general relativity ) .",
    "the advantage to pass from @xmath4 to @xmath1 is due to the fact that the spin of a particle turns out to be related to the torsion just as its mass is responsible for the curvature . from this point of view",
    ", such a generalization includes the spin fields of matter into the same geometrical scheme of general relativity @xcite .    in what follows , we will compare the obtained solution with data coming from observations .",
    "it is well known that the use of astrophysical standard candles provides a fundamental mean of measuring the cosmological parameters .",
    "type ia supernovae ( sneia ) are the best candidates for this aim since they can be accurately calibrated and can be detected at enough high red - shift .",
    "this fact allows to discriminate among cosmological models . to this aim",
    ", one can fit a given model to the observed magnitude - redshift relation , conveniently expressed as :    @xmath44    being @xmath45 the distance modulus and @xmath46 the dimensionless luminosity distance .",
    "the distance in the model we are considering is completely equivalent to the one in a spatially flat universe with a non - zero cosmological constant .",

    "the distance modulus is then simply @xmath52 .",
    "finally , the redshift @xmath53 of the supernova can be determined accurately from the host galaxy spectrum or ( with a larger uncertainty ) from the supernova spectrum .",
    "our model can be fully characterized by two parameters : the today hubble constant @xmath54 and the matter density @xmath55 .",
    "we find their best fit values minimizing the @xmath56 defined as :    @xmath57 ^ 2 } { \\sigma _ { \\mu_{0},i}^{2 } + \\sigma_{mz , i}^{2 } } } \\label{eq : defchi}\\ ] ]    where the sum is over the data points @xcite . in eq.([eq",

    "it is worthwhile to note that , in the case of sne , the error on @xmath54 does not take into account systematic uncertainties due to possible calibration errors . due to this reason it is so small with respect to other results in literature .      besides the above results",
    ", we can discuss how the hubble constant @xmath54 and the torsion density parameter @xmath70 can be constrained also by the angular diameter distance @xmath71 as measured using the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) and the thermal bremsstrahlung ( x - ray brightness data ) for galaxy clusters .",
    "distances measurements using sze and x - ray emission from the intracluster medium are based on the fact that these processes depend on different combinations of some parameter of the clusters ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the sze is a result of the inverse compton scattering of the cmb photons of hot electrons of the intracluster gas",
