    ", we generate an additional single sideband using an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) , and beat it against each of the input optical sidebands .",
    "this is accomplished by splitting off a portion of the optical input signal prior to creating the eom sidebands , and frequency shifting it by @xmath179 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : si_setup ] ) .",
    "this aom - shifted signal is then recombined with the main input signal , giving an overall signal equal to a_,1 = a_1 + a_1 e^-i _ 1 t + a_1 e^i ( _ 1 t + ) + a_3 e^i _",
