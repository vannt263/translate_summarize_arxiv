    "after the discovery of topological insulators , nontrivial properties of topological phases have been extensively studied . in these systems , various remarkable observations have been made because of the presence of gapless edge modes arising from topologically nontrivial bulk properties .",

    "[ fig : mag](d ) .",
    "as seen in this figure , we find that the system shows the topologically nontrivial properties for @xmath52 , while a further increase of the interaction strength induces a topological transition . at this continuous topological transition point , gap - closing in the density of states",

    "we finish this subsection with a comment on the topological structure in the kondo lattice .",
    "as discussed in the next subsection in detail , there is no topological phase if the system is paramagnetic because zeros of the single - particle green s function ( i.e. , pole of the self - energy ) appear . on the other hand , in refs .   and  , the nontrivial phase persists even in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "this apparent contradiction arises from the difference of the used methods ; in refs .   and   the localized spin is treated with the slave - boson approach and is separated into a boson and a fermion which participate in the topological structure .",
    "the authors study the resultant model at the mean - field level , obtaining the paramagnetic topological phase .",
    "however , if the local correlation is treated exactly , the topological structure in the paramagnetic phase is destroyed due to zeros of the green s function in the limit of the kondo lattice . on the other hand , for small @xmath51 , the rkky interaction induces the antiferromagnetic order and removes the zeros of the green s function .",

    "we will demonstrate that in heavy - fermion systems with topological structure , the interplay between electron correlations and topological properties leads to an intriguing crossover behavior ; topological properties are restored at finite temperatures in the region where the topological structure of the ground state is destroyed .",
