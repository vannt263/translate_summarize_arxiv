    "massive star formation presents a challenge in both observational and theoretical studies .",
    "unlike their low - mass counterparts , massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) are typically distant ( @xmath8  kpc ) , obscured ( @xmath9 ) , and often observed in clustered environments . with the development of millimeter interferometers ,",
    "it has become possible to resolve individual , deeply embedded , massive ysos . in the past two decades , a few warm",
    "( @xmath10  k ) , dense ( @xmath11  @xmath12 ) , molecular clumps of high luminosities ( @xmath13 ) have been discovered in the vicinity of ultracompact ( uc )  regions ( turner & welch 1984 ; kurtz et  al .",
    "these molecular clumps exhibit chemistry that is characterized by high abundances of fully hydrogenated species ( van dishoeck & blake 1998 ) , including a variety of organic molecules , such as methyl cyanide ( @xmath4 ) , ethanol ( @xmath14 ) , etc . in a few cases , internal heating of the clumps",
    "is showed directly by radial temperature gradients with ammonia ( @xmath15 ) emission ( cesaroni et  al . 1998 ) .",
    "these molecular clumps were later classified as hot cores . the lack of detectable strmgren spheres further places hot cores in an evolutionary phase earlier than uc  regions ( wilner et  al .",
    "maser emission , such as water and methanol masers , is often associated with hot cores and suggestive of violent collision events ( tarter & welch 1986 ) .",
    "one most interesting phenomenon is an apparent velocity gradient that has been detected in a few hot cores , for example , the orion hot core , w3(h@xmath0o ) , iras  20126 + 4104 , ngc  7538  s , g29.96 - 0.02 , g31.41 + 0.31 , and iras  07427 - 2400 ( plambeck , wright , & carlstrom 1990 ; wyrowski et  al .",

    "; kumar et  al .",
    "although the emission is spatially unresolved in each velocity channel , the velocity gradient has been long proposed as evidence for the keplerian rotation of a circumstellar disk .    at a distance of 2.04  kpc ( hachisuka et  al .",
    "2006 ) , the neighborhood of the w3(oh ) ultracompact ( uc )  region is a nearby , well - studied star - forming region in the course of developing an ob stellar group .",
    "the most recent star - forming activity is taking place in a hot molecular core , w3(h@xmath0o ) , which appears as a warm , dense molecular clump 6  to the east of w3(oh ) .",
    "this hot core was first discovered by & welch ( 1984 ) through an aperture synthesis study of hcn ( @xmath16 ) emission .",
    "the broad line width observed in hcn indicated the presence of an obscured young stellar object , possibly a protostar , with an estimated luminosity of @xmath17 .",
    "proper motions of water masers in w3(h@xmath0o )  can be explained as part of a bipolar outflow ( alcolea et  al .",
    "1993 ) . , welch , & forster ( 1995 ) detected unresolved dust emission at 87.7  ghz with a flux density of 43  mjy , implying a mass of 10 - 20  and a luminosity of @xmath18-@xmath17 .",
    "at centimeter wavelengths , observations with the very large array ( vla ) revealed a synchrotron jet near the expansion center of the water masers ( reid et  al .",
    "1995 ; wilner , reid , & menten 1999 ) .",
    "a secondary continuum source with a rising spectral index was also detected , possibly featuring an additional young stellar object ( wilner et  al .",
    "subsequent line and continuum observations at 220  ghz ( wyrowski et  al . 1999 ) resolved the hot core into three emission components , with two components ( a and c ) roughly coincident with two temperature peaks of about 200  k , derived from the hnco @xmath19 and @xmath20 lines .",
    "in addition , a linear velocity gradient spanning about along the east - west direction was found within a region of 1  across the hot core ( wyrowski et  al .",
    "1997 ) . this gradient was found by plotting the positions of maximum emission derived from channel maps in several lines .",
    "the total gradient spanned an angular range of about 1 , smaller than the instrumental resolution .",
    "thus , it was unclear what could be the source of the gradient .",
    "( 1997 ) proposed three interesting possibilities .",
    "the first suggestion was that the high excitation molecules traced the sides of the cavity carved out by the outflows associated with the water masers .",
    "the second idea was that the gradient represents a large disk seen edge - on .",
    "the third idea was that there might be a double source with different radial velocities with the components associated with the two centimeter continuum sources .",
    "the present study is an extension of the plateau de bure work ( wyrowski et  al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) enabled by the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) millimeter array with its longer baselines and more extensive @xmath21 coverage . although the bima array has less collecting area , the w3(h@xmath0o )  source is sufficiently bright to be imaged .",
    "we have mapped the continuum emission at wavelengths of 1.4  mm and 2.8  mm at very high angular resolution in search of the large disk or whatever else might be the source of the velocity gradient .",
    "the angular resolution is 026 at 1.4  mm and 040 at 2.8  mm , allowing us to study the structure and dust properties of the components within the hot core in detail .",
    "we have also observed the @xmath22 and @xmath23 components of the @xmath4 @xmath5 transitions with 1  resolution to derive the temperature at each continuum peak .",
    "the kinematics are also obtained with high precision by simultaneously fitting gaussians to each of the 5 observed @xmath3 components .",
    "the continuum emission was mapped at both 1.4  mm and 2.8  mm in the a and b configurations of the bima array .",
    "the pointing center was ( @xmath24,@xmath25)(j2000 ) = ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the calibrators were 0359 + 509 at 1.4  mm and 0228 + 673 at 2.8  mm .",
    "the flux densities of the calibrators were determined by comparison with the be star mwc  349 , whose flux densities were assumed to be 1.2  jy and 1.9  jy at 2.8  mm and 1.4  mm , respectively ( dreher & welch 1983 ; tafoya , g ' omez , & rodrguez 2004 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the flux scale was estimated with the variance in the flux measurements of 3c84 , and should be good within 15% .",
    "the 1.4  mm data set taken in the a configuration provided highest spatial frequencies , which resolved the uc  region w3(oh ) into a shell - like structure .",
    "the three continuum data sets at 1.4  mm were observed in fast - switching mode , consisting of a 2 minute cycle on 0359 + 509 , 0228 + 673 , and w3(oh ) to trace the rapid atmospheric phase fluctuation .",
    "additionally , a 1.5 minute integration on 0359 + 509 was repeated every 20 minutes to help gain amplitude solutions .",
    "the reference source , 0228 + 673 , was included to monitor the imaging quality .",
    "the typical system temperature was @xmath27  k , and the typical phase noise was about @xmath28 .",
    "the 2.8  mm continuum data sets were observed in a regular fashion , which repeats the calibrator , 0228 + 673 , every 5 minutes .",
    "the calibration and imaging were performed with the miriad software package .",
    "the two sidebands were calibrated independently .",
    "every data set was first calibrated by deriving phase - only gain solutions from the calibrator on a timescale of 2 or 5 minutes , followed by solving complex gains on a longer timescale of @xmath29 to @xmath30 minutes .",
    "the combined complex gains were transfered to the source data , which were further improved with one iteration of phase - only self calibration , with the exception of the 1.4  mm a - configuration data that showed no improvement after self calibration .",
    "the self - calibration intervals were about 1 or 3 minutes , depending on the wavelengths and configurations .",
    "the self calibration was performed on w3(oh ) for the a - configuration data and on both w3(oh ) and w3(h@xmath0o )  for the b - configuration data .",
    "when multiple data sets were available , a combined map was made to be the model for self calibration .",
    "the astrometery at 1.4  mm after the self - calibration was checked with reference quasar , 0228 + 673 : first applied the phase - only gain solutions to 0228 + 673 , generated an image , and then performed gaussian fit to find the emission centroid .",
    "the positional errors were less than 0014 and 005 for the a- and b - configuration data , respectively . because the observations in the a  configuration resolved w3(h@xmath0o ) , the images were formed by combining the visibilities from both the a and b configurations .",
    "both sidebands were used in a multi - frequency synthesis to generate line - free continuum maps .",

    "if the temperature profile follows @xmath128 , the density distribution for each source has a power - law index of @xmath251 , which is close to the power - law index of @xmath252 for free - fall collapse .",
    "the luminosity of source  a is in the range of @xmath253  and that of source  c is in the range of @xmath254 .",
    "the luminosities of the two binary members correspond to zams spectral type b0.5 - b0 .",
    "since a star of spectral type earlier than b3 will produce an observable  region , we expect each member of the binary to develop its own  region in the future .",
    "7 .   based on the brightness temperature argument of the five @xmath3 components ,",
    "the methyl cyanide emission should emerge from regions significantly smaller than the extent of the warm dust .",
    "the methyl cyanide line model provides a temperature estimate of @xmath132  k for source  a and @xmath255  k for source  c at the reference radius of 500 au .",
    "8 .   excluding any mass contained in central protostars , the derived luminosity to nebular mass ratio , @xmath220 , is larger than @xmath219 , but smaller than the eddington limit by one order of magnitude",
    "the virial masses derived from the line widths set upper limits for the masses at 12  for source  a and 28  for source  c.    we wish to thank mel wright for help with the bima data analysis and plotting programs , miriad and wip .",
    "thanks to dick plambeck for help with many questions that arose during this research . thanks also",

    "the energy levels of a symmetric - top molecule can be described by two quantum numbers , @xmath256 and @xmath3 , where @xmath256 is the total angular momentum and @xmath3 is its projection on the symmetry axis of the molecule .",
    "the rotational energy @xmath257 of a symmetric - top rotor including centrifugal stretching can be written as ( sutton et  al . 1986 ; 1993 ) @xmath258 where @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , and @xmath263 are molecular constants and we have adopted the values given by & mueller ( 1996 ) . the energy level diagram of methyl cyanide is showed in fig .  [ level ] .",
    "since a symmetric - top molecule has no dipole moment perpendicular to the symmetry axis , a radiative transition can not change the angular momentum along this axis .",
    "therefore , radiative transitions are only allowed between adjacent @xmath256 levels within a single @xmath3 ladder .",
    "the spacing between adjacent @xmath256 levels only decreases slightly in different @xmath3 ladders . as a result , the transitions of adjacent @xmath256 levels , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath264 , in various @xmath3 ladders happen at nearly the same frequency and can be observed simultaneously .",
    "each successive @xmath3 component is shifted to a slightly lower frequency due to the centrifugal distortion .",
    "the three identical hydrogen nuclei in methyl cyanide create threefold symmetry .",
    "when a pair of hydrogen nuclei are exchanged , the combined effect of 120@xmath265  rotation and nuclear spins brings additional symmetry requirements that further divide the molecules into two distinct species : ortho- and para-@xmath4 .",
    "rotational levels with @xmath266 ( @xmath267 is an integer ) , belong to the ortho - species , while levels with @xmath268 belong to the para - species .",
    "the ortho- and para - species are sometimes referred to as the a and e species , respectively .",
    "the a and e species are essentially independent since the probability of changing nuclear spin state in a collision is very small and radiative transition between species is forbidden .",
    "because of the symmetry requirement , the statistical weight , @xmath269 , of the a species is twice larger than that of the e species with the exception of the @xmath270 ladder , where half of the levels are forbidden due to the total cancellation of the wave function .",
    "the collision rate coefficients for downward transitions , @xmath177 , of methyl cyanide were first calculated by ( 1983 ) and expanded to higher energy levels and higher temperature up to @xmath271  k by ( 1986 ) to better match the conditions in star - forming regions .",
    "the basic idea is to express collision rate coefficients in terms of a few fundamental rates , @xmath272 , that are simply related to excitation out of the lowest @xmath273 level .",
    "the collision rate coefficient for the transition @xmath274 of a symmetric - top molecular can be expressed as @xmath275 \\quad \\mathrm{cm^3 \\ ,",

    "given a power - law density distribution of @xmath277 , the enclosed mass within a radius of @xmath278 is @xmath279 .",
    "the gravitational potential energy , @xmath280 , for a clump of radius @xmath281 can be calculated by @xmath282 where @xmath283 is the total mass of the clump .",
