    "construction of explicit exact solutions for integrable systems is an important and well developed area of research .",
    "there is a variety of methods designed to tackle this problem and vast literature concerning soliton solutions of rank one . in this paper",
    "we develop the dressing method in application to a periodic two - dimensional volterra system and derive explicitly soliton solutions of arbitrary rank .",
    "we found solutions resembling breathers ( in the theory of the sine - gordon equation ) , nonlinear periodic waves and a new type of exact solution for integrable systems , which are smooth interfaces between two nonlinear periodic waves or a periodic wave and a trivial ( zero ) solution .",
    "the dressing method for lax integrable systems was originally formulated and developed in @xcite .",
    "its predecessor was proposed by bargmann ( 1949 ) @xcite , where the author performed the dressings of the schrdinger operator and discovered potentials , which now we would associate with the profiles of one and two soliton solutions for the korteweg de  vries ( kdv ) equation .",
    "the connection of the potentials of the schrdinger operators with solutions of the kdv equation was established much later by gardner , greene , kruskal and miura , who discovered the inverse spectral transform @xcite .",
    "a year later an elegant interpretation of their results was given by lax in @xcite , where the concept of lax pair has first appeared .",
    "in this paper , we develop the dressing method and study exact solutions for the @xmath5dimensional generalisation of the periodic volterra lattice @xcite @xmath6 system ( [ 2 + 1 ] ) can be regarded as an integrable discretisation of the kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) equation ( see section [ sec33 ] ) .",
    "the kp equation , originally derived for ion - acoustic waves of small amplitude in plasma @xcite , is a @xmath7dimensional integrable generalisation of the kdv equation .",
    "its mathematical theory made a deep impact to the theory of integrable equations and give rise to useful notions such as @xmath8 function and sato grassmanian @xcite .",
    "the kp equation possesses a rich set of exact solutions , whose classification require advanced techniques from cluster algebra , tropical geometry and combinatorics developed in @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ 2 + 1 ] ) was first derived in 1979 motivated by the reduction group theory for lax representation @xcite . for a fixed period @xmath0",
    ", the variables @xmath9 can be eliminated and thus ( [ 2 + 1 ] ) can be rewritten as a system of @xmath10-component second order evolutionary equations . in the simplest nontrivial case @xmath11 , the system ( [ 2 + 1 ] ) becomes @xmath12 and after a point transformation it takes the form of a nonlinear schrdinger type equation ( system `` u4 '' in @xcite ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes complex conjugation . in this case , the system is bi - hamiltonian .",
    "a recursion operator and bi - hamiltonian structure for system ( [ eqn3 ] ) are explicitly constructed from its lax representation in @xcite .",
    "a certain class of darboux transformations for arbitrary fixed period @xmath0 has recently been constructed in @xcite .    for infinite",
    "@xmath0 , equation ( [ 2 + 1 ] ) is an integrable differential - difference equation in @xmath15 dimensions .",
    "it appeared in @xcite where the authors classified a family of equations with the non - locality of intermediate long wave type .",
    "its infinitely many symmetries and conserved densities are constructed using its master symmetry in @xcite .",
    "bargmann s potentials correspond to a rational ( in the wave number ) factor to the jost function @xcite . in the dressing method",
    "we also start with a rational in the spectral parameter @xmath16 matrix factor @xmath17 , which modifies the fundamental solution of the `` undressed '' lax pair . in the case of system (",
    "[ 2 + 1 ] ) the lax operators contain @xmath18 matrices and are invariant with respect to a reduction group isomorphic to @xmath19 .",
    "we construct the reduction group invariant dressing factors @xmath17 which have @xmath0 or @xmath20 simple poles belonging to the orbits generated by transformations @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "the case of @xmath0 simple poles leads to a new class of solutions , which we call kink solutions , while solutions corresponding to the orbits with @xmath20 poles we call breathers .",
    "this terminology is borrowed from the sine - gordon theory where a kink solution corresponds to a dressing factor with one pole and two poles factor leads to a breather solution @xcite .",
    "we could also construct @xmath23 multisoliton solutions with @xmath24 kinks and @xmath25 breathers , but this generalisation is rather straightforward and therefore in this paper we focus on solutions corresponding to a single orbit ( i.e. one kink and one breather solutions ) .",
    "a kink solution can be parametrised by a real number @xmath26 and a point on a real grassmannian @xmath27 , while a breather solution can be uniquely parametrised by a complex number @xmath28 such that @xmath29 and a point on a complex grassmannian @xmath30 .",
    "the number @xmath1 in @xmath31 is the rank of the soliton solution .",
    "there is a difference between the cases of even and odd @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath0 is even , there are two different orbits with @xmath0 points , namely @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "they results in two different kink solutions .",
    "a fine classification of wave interfaces ( in the kink case ) and soliton interactions ( in the breather case ) can be naturally given in the terms of the invariant schubert cell decomposition of the grassmannian .",
    "in particular , elementary line breathers and periodic kink solutions correspond to one - dimensional invariant schubert cells of the grassmannians .",
    "kink solutions represent regions filled by non - linear periodic waves with moving interfaces between the regions , see figure [ t ] .",
    "thus we also call them wave fronts .     for @xmath34 of rank 1 and",
    "rank 2 kink solutions ]    breathers correspond to a cascade of soliton decays and fusions .",
    "the density plots of a breather solution in the @xmath35-plane resemble soliton webs of the kp equations in the @xmath36-plane for a fixed moment of time , see figure [ tb ]",
    ".     for @xmath34 of rank 1 and rank 2 breather solutions , title=\"fig : \" ]   for @xmath34 of rank 1 and rank 2 breather solutions , title=\"fig : \" ]    in the paper we give explicit and detailed derivation for these two types of soliton solutions of arbitrary rank for the two dimensional volterra system ( [ 2 + 1 ] ) and give a complete classification of rank @xmath2 kink and breather solutions .",
    "the arrangement of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we recall the lax representation for equation ( [ 2 + 1 ] ) and its reduction group . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we discuss the dressing method in the presence of the reduction group .",
    "we explicitly derive both kink and breather solutions for equation ( [ 2 + 1 ] ) on the trivial background using the dressing method .",

    "@xmath2 kink solutions , we start with a description of all possible rank 1 kink solutions in the cases of @xmath41 and further prove the general results for arbitrary dimensions . for rank @xmath2 breather solutions we present some typical configurations and the general result on the number of possible distinct configurations .",
    "our definition soliton graphs based on tropicalisation is motivated by @xcite although we do not have structure associated with wronskian of solutions . in the conclusion",
    "we summarise our results and discuss the feasibility of a full classification of higher rank solutions .",
    "let us consider general matrix operators of the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are total derivatives in @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively , @xmath47 is a spectral parameter , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are @xmath18 traceless matrices @xmath50 and the matrices @xmath51 and @xmath52 are functions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "this is often called a zero curvature representation or lax representation of equation ( [ 2 + 1 ] ) .",
    "these two operators , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , are conventionally called the lax pair .",
