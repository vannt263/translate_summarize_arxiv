    "<S> we have shown that a study of the vector - to - pseudoscalar ratios at lep as a function of @xmath7 allows to obtain estimates of these ratios for promptly produced mesons at @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> these estimates , as well as the @xmath36/(|@xmath34 + @xmath91 ) and ( @xmath84 + @xmath83)/2(|@xmath34 + @xmath91 ) ratios for the total rates , have been found in very good agreement with the results of the mirabelle and bebc ^+p @xmath10  experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the fragmentation properties of the @xmath12 valence quark of the incident kaon and strange quarks produced in e^+e^- @xmath95  annihilation are very similar . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this interesting experimental observation is not unexpected . in the lund string model @xcite ( implemented in the jetset 7.4 generator ) , </S>",
    "<S> quark - antiquark pair in an @xmath96 event is produced in a colour force field stretched between the @xmath97 and the @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the hadron production is viewed as a breaking of the string which can be interpreted as virtual @xmath99 pair production in a colour flux - tube . </S>",
    "<S> a soft hadronic collision is also considered in this model as a colour separation mechanism whereby valence quarks of incident meson act as borders of colour strings , analogous to the @xmath100 field in e^+e^- @xmath95  annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is not surprising that many features in fragmentation of the @xmath12 valence quark of the incident ^+ @xmath13  and strange quarks in e^+e^- @xmath95   annihilation must be similar . </S>",
    "<S> other fragmentation models for soft , low-@xmath101 hadron - hadron interactions such as the dual sheet models based on the dual topological unitarization ( dtu ) ( see @xcite , for example ) differ from the lund model in their prescriptions for the number and topology of colour strings and in the role attributed to valence quarks ( as discussed , for example , in @xcite ) . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of meson induced reactions with e^+e^- @xmath95  data might allow to get better understanding of the fate of meson valence quarks and to discriminate among different approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of the jetset model have been found in good agreement with the results of the lep and ^+p @xmath10  experiments on the vector - to - pseudoscalar ratios for the promptly produced mesons as well as with the @xmath36/(|@xmath34 + @xmath91 ) and ( @xmath84 + @xmath83)/2(|@xmath34 + @xmath91 ) ratios for the total and direct rates . </S>",
    "<S> the pei model predictions are also in reasonable agreement with the data , apart from the ^0 @xmath23/@xmath24  ratio and significant disagreement with the mirabelle result on the ( @xmath84 + @xmath83)/2(|@xmath34 + @xmath91 ) ratio for the direct rates . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the pei prediction about significantly smaller fraction of promptly produced octet baryons in comparison with jetset might be too strong . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest spin models of fragmentation based on spin counting and , in particular , the quark - combinatorics model of anisovich et al . </S>",
