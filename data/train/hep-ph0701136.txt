    "<S> we systematically construct two kinds of models with canonical gauge coupling unification and universal high - scale supersymmetry breaking . in the first we introduce standard vector - like particles while in the second we also include non - standard vector - like particles . </S>",
    "<S> we require that the gauge coupling unification scale is from @xmath0 gev to the planck scale , that the universal supersymmetry breaking scale is from 10 tev to the unification scale , and that the masses of the vector - like particles ( @xmath1 ) are universal and in the range from 200 gev to 1 tev . using two - loop renormalization group equation ( rge ) running for the gauge couplings and one - loop rge running for yukawa couplings and the higgs quartic coupling , we calculate the supersymmetry breaking scales , the gauge coupling unification scales , and the corresponding higgs mass ranges . </S>",
