    "the entries of a matrix @xmath18 can be indexed by four indices , @xmath19 identifying the block of @xmath20 the matrix entry belongs to , and @xmath21 fixing the position of the matrix entry inside the block .",
    "then , the partial transposed matrix @xmath22 has coordinates @xmath23    motivated by questions in quantum information theory , the partial transposition operation for wishart matrices was studied by aubrun @xcite , who showed that , for certain special values of the parameters , the empirical spectral distribution of @xmath24 converges in moments to a non - centered semicircular distribution . in this paper",

    "_    observe that if one applies the transposition map on the first factor of the tensor product @xmath26 instead of the second one , the spectral distribution of @xmath24 remains unchanged . indeed , this follows from @xmath27 and from the fact that applying the global transposition leaves the spectral distribution unchanged .",
    "the above theorem basically generalizes aubrun s result in @xcite , modulo some standard free probability facts , regarding the relationship between the free poisson laws and the semicircle laws .",
    "also , as a remark of algebraic interest , in the formal limit @xmath28 , the law that we obtain is a free difference of free poisson laws having the same parameter , namely @xmath29 , so it is a ( modified ) free bessel law in the sense of @xcite .",
    "our second result regards the various properties of the limiting measure . by using tools from free probability theory and from classical analysis , we obtain the following result .",
    "* theorem b. *    _ the limiting measure found in theorem a has the following properties : _    1 .",

    "the quantum state @xmath37 is said to be ppt ( positive partial transpose ) .",
    "hence , separable states are always ppt and non - ppt states are necessarily entangled .",
    "the equivalence of entanglement and non - ppt is known to hold only for total dimension smaller than 6 ( @xmath38 or @xmath39 product systems ) and it fails for larger dimensions , in the sense that there exist ppt entangled states . in the same spirit as in @xcite ,",
    "the results regarding the positivity of the support of the limit measure can be interpreted as results about typicality of ppt states for large quantum systems .",
    "wishart matrices ( normalized to have unit trace ) are known to be physically reasonable models for random quantum states on a tensor product @xmath40 , the parameter @xmath41 of the wishart distribution being related to the size of some environment @xmath42 needed to define the state .",
    "so , as a conclusion , theorem a and theorem b above indicate that , when @xmath43 and @xmath44 , a typical state in @xmath40 is ppt .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in [ sec : moments ] we present a combinatorial formula for the asymptotic moments of @xmath25 , in [ sec : mgf ] we find an equation for the corresponding moment generating function , and in [ sec : main ] we state and prove the main result . in sections",
