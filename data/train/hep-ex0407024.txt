    "the data samples used for the analyses are taken with the beijing spectrometer ( besii ) detector  @xcite at the beijing electron - positron collider ( bepc ) storage ring at a center - of - mass energies corresponding to @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the data samples contain @xmath12 @xmath3 events and @xmath13 @xmath4 events , as determined from inclusive hadronic decays .",
    "it has been determined that for many two - body exclusive @xmath4 decays  @xcite the relative phases between the three - gluon and the one - photon annihilation amplitudes are near @xmath14 . for @xmath3 decays , the available information about the phase is much more limited because there are fewer experimental measurements .",
    "the analysis of @xmath15 ( vp ) decays shows that the phase could be the same as observed in @xmath4 decays  @xcite , but it could not rule out the possibility that the phase is near @xmath16 as suggested in ref .",

    "this branching fraction , together with branching fractions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , are used to extract the relative phase between the three - gluon and the one - photon annihilation amplitudes of the @xmath3 decays to pseudoscalar meson pairs .",
    "it is found that a relative phase of @xmath23 or @xmath24 can explain the experimental results  @xcite .    a similar analysis of the @xmath4 data sample yields an improved measurement of the @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ kskl ] ) branching fraction  @xcite : @xmath26 , which is more than @xmath27 larger than the world average  @xcite . comparing with the corresponding branching fraction for @xmath0 , one gets @xmath28 .",
    "this result indicates that @xmath3 decays is enhanced by more than 4@xmath19 relative to the `` 12% rule '' expected from perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite , while for almost all other channels where the deviations from the `` 12% rule '' are observed , @xmath3 decays are suppressed .",

    "the @xmath32 , also an @xmath30- and @xmath31-wave mixed charmonium state will have a decay branching fraction to @xmath29 between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "four @xmath36 ( vt ) decay channels @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are investigated to test the pqcd `` @xmath41 rule ''  @xcite .",
    "previous besi results  @xcite on these channels reveal that these vt decay modes are suppressed compared to the pqcd prediction . however , the measurements , using about @xmath42 @xmath3 events , determined only upper limits or branching fractions with large errors .",

    "table  [ besii_vt ] summarizes the results of the four branching fraction measurements , as well as the corresponding branching fractions of @xmath48 decays , and the ratios of the @xmath3 to @xmath48 branching fractions .",
    "all four vt decay modes are suppressed by a factor of 3 to 5 compared with the pqcd expectation .",
    "this mode is also investigated to test the pqcd `` @xmath41 rule ''  @xcite and to study the relative phase between strong and electromagnetic decays of the charmonium  @xcite . here",

    "the branching fractions are listed in table  [ besii_vp ] , compared with the corresponding branching fractions of @xmath4 decays , @xmath3 decays are suppressed relative to the 12% rule expectation .",
    "the ratio @xmath69 shows a large isospin violation between the charged mode and neutral mode of @xmath56 decays , this is understandable since the electromagnetic decay amplitudes are different in these two channels .",
    "contributions from the continuum @xmath70 hadrons @xcite are estimated using a data sample of @xmath71  pb@xmath72 taken at @xmath73  gev , about one - third of the integrated luminosity at the @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath74 events are observed in @xmath75 , while no events in charged channel .",
    "since the signals are not significant due to the limited statistics , they are not considered in the branching ratio determination above . however ,",

    "hadronic decay rates of p - wave quarkonium states provide good tests of qcd .",
    "the decays @xmath5 have been calculated using different models  @xcite , and recently , the decay branching fractions of @xmath80 baryon and anti - baryon pairs were calculated including the contribution of the color - octet fock states  @xcite . using the @xmath5 branching fractions as input to determine the matrix element ,",
    "the partial widths of @xmath6 are predicted to be about half of those of @xmath5 , for @xmath81 and @xmath82 . as shown in table  [ br ] , the measurements of @xmath6  @xcite together with the branching fractions of @xmath5  @xcite from the same data sample , indicate that @xmath6 is enhanced relative to @xmath5 , as compared with the color - octet mechanism ( com ) calculation  @xcite .",

    "evidence for @xmath86 production from @xmath85 decays is obtained for the first time  @xcite .",
    "the left plot of figure  [ scaa ] shows scatter plot of @xmath87 versus @xmath87 invariant mass for the events in @xmath85 mass region ( from 3.30 to 3.48  gev ) , and the definition of the signal and background control regions .",
    "the signal region is shown in the figure as a circle centered at @xmath88  gev and with a radius of 80  mev , and the background is estimated from the events between two circles with radii of 120  mev and 160  mev .",
    "there are 65 and 51 events in the signal and background regions , respectively .",
    "so the number of @xmath86 events is estimated to be 65 - 51/1.75 = @xmath89 , where 1.75 is the normalization factor  the ratio of the area of background region to that of the signal region .",
    "we obtain the signal significance of the @xmath86 of 4.6@xmath19 using the method described in ref .  @xcite . after requiring that the mass of one of the @xmath87 pairs lies between 0.88 and 1.04  gev ,",

    "@xmath96 at the 95% c. l. the former is much more stringent than the previous mark - iii measurement  @xcite , and the latter is the first search for this channel in @xmath3 decays . the current bounds on the production rates are still far beyond the sensitivity needed for testing the epr paradox  @xcite , and even farther for cp violation  @xcite .",
