    "one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in physics is that of dark energy .",
    "dark energy was proposed by several research groups back in 1998 aiming to explain the accelerated expansion regime governing the current universe .",
    "later , this accelerated expansion was discovered thanks to the vast amount of astrophysical information obtained from measurements of the supernovae type ia ( snia ) luminosities [ @xcite ] , as well as to the anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation [ @xcite ] , and the analysis of the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe [ @xcite ] .",
    "the cosmological constant is the most common and simple candidate to serve as dark energy [ @xcite ] , but this proposition contains several difficulties as the fine tuning and the coincidence problems .",
    "a number of models have been proposed in the literature including scalar field as an alternative to explain dark energy nature , among which one finds quintessence , k - essence , tachyon and dilaton fields [ @xcite ] .",
    "other approaches include brane - world models [ @xcite ] , modified gravity theories ( @xmath2 gravitation ) , where dark energy emerges as a modification of geometry [ @xcite ] ( for an exhaustive discussion on these scenarios , the reader may review ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] ) , and dark energy models with unconventional equation of state [ @xcite ] .",
    "recently , a different idea has attracted considerable attention , proposing a model which has its roots on quantum gravity and is known as the holographic principle [ @xcite ] .",
    "the foundation of the holographic principle resides in the idea that the entropy of a given system does not depend upon the volume , but rather on the surface area surrounding it . in a cosmological context , the holographic principle establishes an upper limit for the entropy of the universe [ @xcite ] .",
    "the authors of @xcite , conjecture that in a quantum field theory there exists a relationship between an ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff and an infrared ( ir ) cutoff , @xmath3 , which origins lies on the constraint imposed to a region of space preventing a black hole formation .",
    "the size of this region should not be larger than @xmath3 , meaning that if there is an energy density @xmath4 ( zero - point quantum energy density ) in a region associated to the uv , then the total energy in a region of size @xmath3 can not overpass the mass of a black hole with the same size , so that @xmath5 in the cosmological context , the holographic energy density @xmath4 corresponds to the dark energy density ( holographic dark energy ) [ @xcite ] .",
    "the maximum value @xmath3 can take is obtained by considering the equality in equation ( [ ecu1 ] ) , such that the holographic energy density is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a numerical constant and @xmath8 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "several approaches for the ir cutoff @xmath3 have been proposed in the literature [ @xcite ] .",
    "for instance , in [ @xcite ] , a generalized holographic dark energy model was proposed , identifying the ir cutoff with combination of frw parameters . in this work",
    ", we consider the one given by granda and oliveros in @xcite , where the authors took the holographic dark energy density to depend on the usual quadratic term in the hubble parameter ( @xmath9 ) as well as on the time derivative of @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "this model has been widely studied by the scientific community in various contexts and it has been known as the new holographic dark energy model ( nhde ) .    among the vast variety of approaches to the dark energy problem",
    ", it is also considered the possibility to include an interaction term @xmath11 between the dark energy and dark matter components , usually introduced aiming to avoid the coincidence problem ( in @xcite a recent review of this topic is offered ) .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite showed that this kind of interaction is favoured by current cosmological observations in an extended @xmath12cdm model . due to our ignorance about the fundamental origin of dark energy , the interaction term is introduced by phenomenological considerations .",
    "this term is usually proportional either to the dark energy density , the dark matter or to a linear combination of both ( see for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the sign in @xmath11 determines the direction of the flux of energy .",
    "if it is @xmath11 is positive , dark energy decays in dark matter , while if @xmath11 is negative , dark matter decays on dark energy .",
    "some authors have also considered the possibility to have non - linear interaction terms [ @xcite ] . here",
    "we take this last idea , whit a concrete selection for the interaction term @xmath11 , which allows us to find analytical and phenomenologically feasible solutions .",
    "this article is organised as follows : in section 2 we introduce the dark energy holographic model together with the interaction term between dark matter and dark energy , and we obtain the basic quantities to be used in subsequent calculations .",
    "section 3 shows the correspondence of this model with quintessence and tachyon scalar fields .",
    "finally , in section 4 we expose our conclusions .",
    "the friedmann equations for a flat universe type frw are @xmath13 @xmath14 where we take @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; @xmath17 is the dark matter density , @xmath4 is the dark energy density and @xmath18 the pressure due to the dark energy component .",
    "@xmath19 is the hubble parameter and the dot represents the derivative with respect to time .",
    "we considered that the dark energy component is the holographic energy density which has the form [ @xcite ] @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are positive constants .    when a possible interaction between dark matter and dark energy components are taken into account ,",
    "the continuity equations take the form @xmath23 @xmath24 in the literature , the usual choices for @xmath11 consist of linear terms of either dark matter , dark energy or a linear combination of both .",
    "it is possible , however , to consider non - linear forms for @xmath11 . in @xcite",
    "the cosmological evolution of the universe is analysed , considering a non - linear interaction term of the general form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a positive coupling constant , @xmath27 and the powers @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 characterise the interaction .",
    "the ansatz ( [ e1 ] ) contains a variety of interactions considered in the literature , for instance , for @xmath31 one gets @xmath32 and for @xmath33 one has @xmath34 .    in this paper",
