    "topological insulator ( ti ) is a new class of material which is an insulator in its bulk , while having time reversal symmetry protected conducting states on the edge or surface .",
    "@xcite a large number of realistic materials have been theoretically proposed and experimentally confirmed , such as bi@xmath1se@xmath2 and bi@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite however , the layered transition - metal pentatelluride zrte@xmath0 ( and hfte@xmath0 ) is a particular example . zrte@xmath0 and hfte@xmath0",
    "have been studied more than 30 years ago due to the large thermoelectric power  @xcite and mysterious resistivity anomaly  @xcite .",
    "recently , weng _ et al .",
    "_ predicted that mono - layer zrte@xmath0 and hfte@xmath0 are good quantum spin hall insulators with relatively large bulk band gap ( about 0.1 ev ) by first principles calculations .",
    "@xcite and the three - dimensional bulk phase of zrte@xmath0 and hfte@xmath0 are also predicted to be tis , which are located at the vicinity of a transition between strong and weak ti , but without detailed description .",
    "@xcite    nevertheless , subsequent experiments show many contradictions about the topological nature of zrte@xmath0 or hfte@xmath0 .",
    "several experimental works suggested that zrte@xmath0 is a dirac semi - metal without a finite band gap by different characterization methods , such as shubnikov - de haas oscillations , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , and infrared reflectivity measurements .",
    "@xcite of course there are also other experimental works holding opposite point of view .",
    "for example , in two recent scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments , they unambiguously observed a large bulk band gap about 80 or 100 mev in zrte@xmath0 ,  @xcite implying that there is no surface state on the top surface and therefore it should be a weak ti .",
    "another apres work also favored a weak ti for zrte@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite however , there are two other arpes works which believed that zrte@xmath0 is a strong ti .",
    "@xcite for instance , by using the comprehensive arpes , stm , and first principles calculations , manzoni _ et al .",
    "_ found a metallic dos at fermi energy , which arises from the two - dimensional surface state and thus indicates zrte@xmath0 is a strong ti .",
    "@xcite    the divergence of these experiments make zrte@xmath0 ( hfte@xmath0 ) being a very puzzling but interesting material , which needs more further experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "therefore , in order to figure out the physical mechanism behind those contradictory experimental results , we revisited the band structures of zrte@xmath0 and hfte@xmath0 , and carefully studied their relationship with the volume expansion .",
    "we find a clear topological transition between a strong and weak ti in zrte@xmath0 and hfte@xmath0 , accompanied by a dirac semi - metal phase between them .",
    "this work could shed more light on a unified explain about the different experimental results , and propose the crucial clue to further experiments to elucidate the topological nature of zrte@xmath0 and hfte@xmath0 .",

    "the theoretical ground states of zrte@xmath0 and hfte@xmath0 are obtained by fully optimization of the atom positions and lattice constants , until the maximal residual force is less than 0.01 ev / ",

    "we change volume of the unit cell by hand and then optimize the atom positions and lattice constants under each variant volumes .",
    "this process can simulate the hydrostatic pressure experiments or the thermal expansion effect due to a finite temperatures .",
    "it is noted that we did not change the volume drastically , and the system is far away from the region of superconductivity phase under high pressure found in zrte@xmath0 and hfte@xmath0 .",

    "is expected and given in fig . 2 ( b ) .",
    "the blue vertical dotted line represent the experimental volume at low temperature ( 10 k ) , which is nearly 1.9% smaller than our calculated value .",
    "then we have calculated the band structures and the density of states ( doss ) with soc under variant volumes , and three of them are shown in fig .",
    "3 . the calculated band structure ( fig .",
    "3 ( a ) ) at the ground state volume ( @xmath12 ) is similar as previous theoretical computation  @xcite , although we use a different high symmetry k - path .",
    "a clear direct band gap about 94.6 mev at @xmath13 point is found in the band structure .",
    "of course it is also found that the valence band maxima is between the @xmath13 and y point and conduction band minima is between the a@xmath14 and t point .",
    "therefore the indirect band gap is much smaller than the direct one at @xmath13 point , which is about 41.7 mev in fig .",
    "the present of a clear band gap is confirmed in its corresponding dos ( fig .",
    "3 ( d ) ) .",
    "our calculated band gap is comparable with the values observed in the previous experiments ,  @xcite which is 80 or 100 mev .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the slop of dos in the conduction band is much larger than that in the valence band , possibly because the conduction band has more valleys than the valence band .",
    "this characteristic is also found in the experiments .",
    "@xcite    when zrte@xmath0 expands from its ground state , the band gap decreases gradually until the valence and conduction bands touch each other at a critical volume expansion ratio about 2.72% .",
    "then , a dirac point is formed at @xmath13 point , which can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "this behavior is also confirmed in its corresponding v - shaped dos near the fermi energy , as shown in fig .",
    "3(e ) , which is the feature of dirac point in band structure .",
    "as the crystal continues to expand , the band gap of zrte@xmath0 opens again , and ultimately reaches a value of about 102.6 ( direct ) or 27.7 mev ( indirect ) under a volume expansion 6.12% .",
    "( see figure 3 ( c ) and ( f ) ) . therefore from fig .",
    "3 , we can clearly see a transition from a semiconductor to a semi - metal and then to a semiconductor again in zrte@xmath0 when it expands . in order to check whether such a transition is topological or not ,",
    "we have calculated the @xmath15 indices under each volume .  @xcite it is found that the @xmath15 indices are all ( 1;110 ) when the volume expansion is less than 2.72% , while it is ( 0;110 ) when the volumes expansion is larger than 2.72% .",
    "this definitively confirms that zrte@xmath0 undergoes a topological phase transition from a strong ti , to a dirac semi - metal , and finally turns to a weak ti when its unit cell expands from 0 to 6.12% in our calculation .",
    "( color online ) ( * a * ) calculated absolute value of direct band gap at @xmath13 point of zrte@xmath0 under different volumes .",
    "the light green and blue region represent the phases of strong and weak tis respectively .",
    "the boundary between the strong and weak ti is the semi - metal state .",
    "the red and blue dotted vertical lines represent the experimental volume at 10 k and calculated one at ground state respectively .",
    "( * b * ) same as ( * a * ) but for hfte@xmath0 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the detailed phase diagrams of such a topological phase transition of zrte@xmath0 and hfte@xmath0 are given in fig .",
    "4 , in which all the calculated absolute value of direct band gaps at @xmath13 point under different volumes are plotted . in fig .",
    "4(a ) we can find that the band gaps of zrte@xmath0 decreases linearly as the volume increases from a negative volume expansion ratio about -6% , with a rate around -33 mev per 1% change of volume , where the negative value means a decrease of the band gap when the crystal expands .",
    "the band gap disappears at @xmath16 .",
    "then it raises linearly with volume in a similar rate of 28 mev per 1% change of volume .",
    "therefore zrte@xmath0 undergoes a strong ti to weak ti topological phase transition due to volume expansion .",
    "such a transition must need a zero - gap intermediate state , which is the semi - metal state found at about @xmath16 in our calculation .",
    "similar phase diagram is also proposed by a recent work ,  @xcite in which they present the band gap at @xmath13 point as a function of the inter - layer distance , but not the volume of the unit cell . in fig .",
    "4(b ) , we also show that hfte@xmath0 has the very similar topological phase transition , with almost the same transition critical volume expansion ratio at about 2.72% .",
    "the band gap of hfte@xmath0 also changes linearly as the volume increases with a rate about -31 and 26 mev per 1% change of volume in the strong and weak ti region respectively .",
    "such a band gap changing rate is quite significant especially in a small band gap semiconductor material .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the electronic properties of zrte@xmath0 ( hfte@xmath0 ) are indeed very sensitive to the change of the volume and they are indeed located very close to the boundary between the strong and weak ti .",
    "although our optimized and the experimentally measured volume of zrte@xmath0 ( hfte@xmath0 ) both indicate that they should be within the strong ti region , we think it still has the possibility that in experiment zrte@xmath0 ( hfte@xmath0 ) can locate in a weak ti region due to different growth methods and characterization techniques in experiments . according to fig .",
    "4 , it is even possible that zrte@xmath0 ( hfte@xmath0 ) can be in the dirac semi - metal phase if it happens that its unit cell has a proper volume expansion ratio , which possibly been observed in many experiments .",
    "@xcite another more possible reason which can explain the semi - metal behavior found in these experiments is due to the defect and doping , which make the zrte@xmath0 ( hfte@xmath0 ) being a degenerate semiconductor . in a degenerate semiconductor ,",
    "the fermi energy is located within the conduction or valence band due to the doping effect , and the crystal will behave like a metal .",
    "but in this case , the energy gap still exist just below or above the fermi energy and the dirac point is not needed in the energy gap . in order to avoid the possible artificial effect induced by the cleavage in both stm and arpes experiments ,",
    "we suggest that nondestructive optical measurements for the existence of a direct band gap at @xmath13 point , and its change under different temperatures , in the high quality and stoichiometric single crystals are probably useful to elucidate the topological nature in zrte@xmath0 and hfte@xmath0 .",
    "finally we show the importance of our calculated change rate of band gap .",
    "first we can roughly estimate the bulk thermal expansion coefficient from experimental lattice constants of zrte@xmath0 ( table i ) to be about @xmath17 k@xmath18 , which means that the volume will change about 1% when the temperature changes from 0 to 300 k , equivalently the band gap of zrte@xmath0 at @xmath13 point will change about -33 mev for strong ti phase or 28 mev for weak ti phase , according to our calculation . in a recent high - resolution arpes work ,  @xcite zhang _ et al .",
    "_ found a clear and dramatic temperature dependent band gap in zrte@xmath0 , from which we then can estimate that change rate of observed band gap is about 26 or 37 mev from 0 to 300 k depending on the methods used in their experiment .",
    "these two values are both well consistent with our calcualted result .",
    "moreover , the positive change rate found in the experiment  @xcite implies that the zrte@xmath0 crystal used in their experiment is probably a weak ti according to our calculated phase diagram in fig .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the band structures of zrte@xmath0 and hfte@xmath0 at variant volume by first principles calculations . a clearly volume dependent strong and weak topological phase transition",
    "is found , accompanied by a zero - gap semi - metal phase at the boundary between the transition .",
    "the direct band gap of zrte@xmath0 at @xmath13 point changes linearly with the volume , which is -33 mev and 28 mev in a strong and weak ti phase respectively , if the volume of zrte@xmath0 increases 1% , or equivalently if the temperature increases from 0 to 300 k. the results for hfte@xmath0 is very similar to thoese of zrte@xmath0 .",
    "our calculated results indicate that the electronic properties and topological nature of zrte@xmath0 and hfte@xmath0 are indeed very sensitive to the lattice constants of crystals , which is probably the reason for the divergent experimental results at present .",
    "we suggest that high quality and stoichiometric single crystal with accurate structure refinement at different temperatures would be helpful to resolve the divergent experimental results in zrte@xmath0 and hfte@xmath0 .",
