    "in this paper i study the anti - charmed @xmath0 resonance @xmath1 ( 3100 ) ( narrow hadron resonance of 3099 mev decaying into a @xmath1 ) very recently discovered by the h1 collaboration at hera @xcite .",
    "this extends to flavour su(4 ) the su(3 ) anti - decuplet @xcite which includes the recently discovered @xmath12(1540 ) @xcite and @xmath13(1860 ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2(1540 ) , @xmath13(1860 ) and @xmath1(3100 ) are extremely exciting states , because they may be the first exotic hadrons to be discovered , with quantum numbers that can not be interpreted as a quark and an anti - quark meson or as a three quark baryon .",
    "exotic multiquarks are expected since the early works of jaffe @xcite , and the su(3 ) exotic anti - decuplet was first predicted within the chiral soliton model @xcite .",
    "pentaquark structures have also been studied in the lattice @xcite .",
    "however the nature of these particles , their isospin , parity @xcite and angular momentum , are yet to be determined .",
    "we recently completed a work on the @xmath14 @xmath2 @xcite where we indicate that the @xmath2 is probably a @xmath15 molecule with binding energy of -30 mev . in that work",
    "we first compute the masses of all the possible s - wave and p - wave @xmath16 pentaquarks , and we verify that these pentaquarks are hundreds of mev too heavy to explain the @xmath12 resonance , except for the @xmath4 , @xmath17 state .",
    "however in this channel we find a purely repulsive exotic @xmath18 hard core s - wave interaction .",
    "this excludes , in our approach , the @xmath2 as a bare pentaquark @xmath14 state or as a tightly bound s - wave @xmath19 narrow resonance .",
    "we then add the @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath18 interactions to study the @xmath2 as a borromean three body s - wave boundstate of a @xmath22 , a @xmath23 and a @xmath24 @xcite , with positive parity @xcite and total isospin @xmath4 . in that paper , and in a very recent work @xcite , we also address the s= -2 , q = -2 state @xmath13 , discovered by the na49 experiment with a mass of 1.862 gev , indicating that this is a @xmath25 molecule with a binding energy of -60 mev .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we also conclude suggesting the existence of similar anti - charmed @xmath0 and anti - bottomed exotic @xmath26 hadrons .",
    "the anti - charmed pentaquark was widely expected @xcite , and its properties will certainly contribute to clarify the nature of the pentaquarks .",
    "the state @xmath1 ( 3100 ) may be similar to the @xmath2 , with the antiquark @xmath27 replaced by a @xmath28 . in this case",
    "it is natural to consider replacing the @xmath24 meson by a @xmath29 meson or by a @xmath30 meson , because the @xmath30 is also a narrow state .",
    "for instance in the new positive parity @xmath31 mesons , @xcite the @xmath32 and the @xmath33 multiquarks are respectively candidates to the scalar @xmath34 and to the axial @xmath35 .",
    "the energy of the is @xmath1 ( 3100 ) consistent with a @xmath36 linear molecule with an energy of + 15 mev above threshold .",
    "this case differs from the previous ones because here there is no negative binding energy .",
    "nevertheless a system which energy is located slightly above threshold is still a narrow state , and in this sense the @xmath1 ( 3100 ) remains in the same family of the @xmath2 and of the @xmath13 .",
    "moreover a natural theoretical motivation exists for considering heptaquarks ( or pentaquarks ) and not just p - wave pentaquarks ( or baryons ) in the exotic multiplet of the @xmath2 .",
    "supose that a given s - wave pentaquark hadron @xmath37 is studied and one concludes that it is unstable .",
    "nevertheless one may consider that a flavor singlet quark - antiquark pair @xmath38 or @xmath39 is created in the hadron @xmath37 . when the resulting heptaquark @xmath40 remains bound , it is a state with an opposite parity to the original @xmath37 , where the reversed parity occurs due to the intrinsic parity of fermions and anti - fermions . in this sense",
    "the new heptaquark @xmath40 can be regarded as the chiral partner of @xmath37 . and , because @xmath40 is expected to be aproximately stable , it is naturally rearranged in a s - wave baryon in two s - wave mesons .",
    "the mass of the heptaquark @xmath40 is expected to be slightly lower than the exact sum of these standard hadron masses due to the binding energy .",
    "this principle explains qualitatively the mass of the @xmath2 @xcite for the @xmath13 @xcite and the masses of the non - exotic multiquarks of the @xmath31 and @xmath41 familly @xcite .    in this paper",
    "i extend the techniques used in our first publications to the @xmath1 ( 3100 ) and to the other similar narrow resonances with an anti - charm or anti - bottom quark . a standard quark model ( qm ) hamiltonian is assumed , with a confining potential and a hyperfine term .",
    "moreover the hamiltonian includes a quark - antiquark annihilation term which is the result of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "i start in this paper by reviewing the qm , and the resonating group method ( rgm ) @xcite which is adequate to study states where several quarks overlap . using the rgm ,",
    "i show that the corresponding exotic baryon - meson short range s - wave interaction is repulsive in exotic channels and attractive in the channels with quark - antiquark annihilation .",
    "the short range repulsion contradicts the existence of narrow pentaquarks with an anti - charm or anti - bottom quark .",
    "i proceed with the study of the linear molecules or heptaquarks @xmath42 , @xmath36 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in particular",
    "the total energy of these systems is discussed .",
    "finally i conclude interpreting the @xmath1 ( 3100 ) and predicting related multiquarks .",
    "our hamiltonian is the standard qm hamiltonian , @xmath45 where each quark or antiquark has a kinetic energy @xmath46 with a constituent quark mass , and the colour dependent two - body interaction @xmath47 includes the standard qm confining term and a hyperfine term , @xmath48 \\ .",
    "\\label{potential}\\ ] ] the qm of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) reproduces the meson and baryon spectrum with quark and antiquark bound - states ( from the heavy quarkonium to the light pion mass ) .",
    "the rgm was first applied by ribeiro @xcite to show that in exotic @xmath49 scattering , the quark - quark potential together with the pauli repulsion of quarks explains the @xmath50 hard core repulsion .",
    "deus and ribeiro @xcite also showed that , in non - exotic channels , the quark - antiquark annihilation could produce a short core attraction .",
    "recently , addressing a tetraquark system with the @xmath51 quantum numbers , it was shown that the qm also fully complies with the chiral symmetry , including the adler zero and the weinberg theorem @xcite .",
    "therefore the qm is adequate to address the anti - decuplet , which was predicted @xcite in an effective chiral model .    for the purpose of this paper the details of the potentials in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) are unimportant , only its matrix elements matter .",
    "the hadron spectrum constrains the hyperfine potential , @xmath52 when a light quark is replaced by a heavy quark , say a charmed quark , the hyperfine interaction is decreased , and it must also be replaced by @xmath53 .",
    "the quark - antiquark annihilation potential @xmath54 is also constrained when the quark model produces spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the annihilation potential @xmath55 is present in the @xmath22 salpeter equation , @xmath56 \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\phi^+ \\\\",
    "\\phi^- \\end{array } \\right ) = m_\\pi \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\phi^+ \\\\",
    "-\\phi^- \\end{array } \\right ) \\label{pion bs}\\ ] ] where the @xmath22 is the only hadron with a large negative energy wave - function , @xmath57 . in eq .",
    "( [ pion bs ] ) the annihilation potential @xmath55 cancels most of the kinetic energy and confining potential @xmath58 .",
    "this is the reason why the pion has a very small mass . from the hadron spectrum and using eq .",
    "( [ pion bs ] ) the matrix elements of the annihilation potential are determined , @xmath59 where this result is correct for the annihilation of @xmath60 or @xmath61 quarks .    the rgm @xcite computes the effective multiquark energy using the matrix elements of the microscopic quark - quark interactions .",
    "any multiquark state can be decomposed in combinations of simpler colour singlets , the baryons and mesons .",
    "the wave functions of quarks are arranged in anti - symmetrized overlaps of simple colour singlet hadrons .",
    "once the internal energies @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the two hadronic clusters are accounted , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the anti - symmetrizer , the remaining energy of the meson - baryon or meson - meson system is computed with the overlap of the inter - cluster microscopic potentials , @xmath66| \\phi_a \\phi_b \\rangle   \\nonumber \\\\ & & / \\langle \\phi_b \\ , \\phi_a |   ( 1+p_{ab})(1-   p_{13 } ) | \\phi_a \\phi_b \\rangle \\ , \\label{overlap kernel } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 stands for the exchange of particle @xmath68 with particle @xmath69 , see fig .",
    "[ rgm overlaps ] .",
    "it is clear that quark exchange provides the necessary colour octets to match the gell - mann matrices @xmath70 present in the potential @xmath47 .",
    "this results in eq .",
    "( [ hyperfine ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ sum rules ] ) times an algebraic colour @xmath71 spin @xmath71 flavour factor and a geometric momentum overlap @xcite .",
    "a good approximation for the wave - functions of the ground - state hadrons is the harmonic oscillator wave - function , @xmath72 where the inverse hadronic radius @xmath73 can not be estimated by electron - hadron scattering because it is masked by the vector meson dominance .",
    "@xmath73 is the only free parameter in this framework . in the case of vanishing external momenta @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the momentum integral in eq .",
    "( [ overlap kernel ] ) is simply @xmath76 .",
    "the annihilation potential only occurs in non - exotic channels .",
    "then it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ sum rules ] ) that the annihilation potential provides an attractive ( negative ) overlap .",
    "the quark - quark(antiquark ) potential is dominated by the hyperfine interaction of eq .",
    "( [ hyperfine ] ) , and in s - wave systems with low spin this results in a repulsive interaction .",
    "these results are independent of the details of the quark model that one chooses to consider , provided it is chiral invariant",
    ". therefore i arrive at the attraction / repulsion criterion , + - _ whenever the two interacting hadrons have quarks ( or antiquarks ) with a common flavour , the repulsion is increased by the pauli principle , + - when the two interacting hadrons have a quark and an antiquark with the same flavour , the attraction is enhanced by the quark - antiquark annihilation_. + in the particular case of one nucleon interacting with anti - kaons and with kaons , this implies that the short range exotic @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 interactions are repulsive .",
    "this shows that the i=0 s - wave pentaquarks @xmath0 and @xmath26 are certainly quite unstable .",
    "higher isospin or spin systems are certainly more unstable in our framework because they have a higher repulsion . on the other hand",
    "the short range @xmath81 , @xmath7 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 interactions can be attractive .",
    "this motivates the study of a linear molecule with a @xmath23 , a @xmath22 and a @xmath29 , or a @xmath85 , or a @xmath86 , or a @xmath87 .",
    "quantitatively @xcite , the effective potentials computed for the different channels , are @xmath88 where @xmath89 are the isospin matrices , normalized with @xmath90 . the vanishing momentum case of eq .",
    "( [ zero p ] ) is sufficient to compute the scattering lengths with the born approximation .",
    "however the study of binding needs the finite momentum case . in the exotic @xmath91 and @xmath92 channels",
    ", it can be proved that the geometric result @xmath76 is then replaced by the separable interaction @xmath93 . in the non - exotic @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 channels",
    "the present state of the art of the rgm does not allow a precise determination of the finite momentum overlap .",
    "nevertheless i assume for simplicity the same separable interaction .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation , because the overlaps decrease when the relative momentum of hadrons @xmath55 and @xmath86 increases .",
    "moreover when the hadronic potential @xmath97 is in a separable form @xmath98 , the energy of the bound state and the matrix element of the potential are simple to compute .",
    "a boundstate coincides with a pole in the t matrix at a negative energy , @xmath99 therefore one just has to find the energy that cancels @xmath100 .",
    "this method also allows the computation of the matrix element of the potential in the boundstate , @xmath101 when @xmath102 is the harmonic oscillator state of eq .",
    "( [ basis ] ) , the necessary condition for binding is , @xmath103",
    "the simplest pentaquarks are not expected to bind due to the attraction / repulsion criterion .",
    "for instance the @xmath1 ( 3100 ) can not be the ground - state @xmath0 pentaquark because the elementary color singlets @xmath105 or @xmath106 are repelled , since the elementary color singlets share the same flavour @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "this also implies that the @xmath107 and @xmath108 systems are unbound .",
    "the @xmath0 pentaquarks with spin , flavour or angular momentum excitations will have larger masses and also large widths .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath28 pentaquarks are more subtle than the @xmath27 ones , because the @xmath30 is quite stable when compared with the @xmath109 . therefore one should also consider to excite the spin in the @xmath110 cluster , and this amounts to study @xmath78 bound - states . indeed the effective potential of eq .",
    "( [ zero p ] ) is attractive in this case .",
    "however this state is coupled to the @xmath77 case also in eq .",
    "( [ zero p ] ) .",
    "once the coupled channel hamiltonian is diagonalized , the energy of the @xmath78 is lifted and the attraction is essentially lost .",
    "therefore the simplest way to have attraction , together with a low energy and with a narrow width , consists in adding at least one quark - antiquark pair to the system",
    ".    then this amounts to include a pion in the system , which can be attracted both by the @xmath23 baryon and by the @xmath29 or @xmath30 meson to produce a @xmath9 or @xmath3 linear molecule .",
    "for instance the flavour includes combinations of terms like @xmath111 where the anti - quark @xmath112 in the pion can be annihilated both by the @xmath60 present in the @xmath23 and by the @xmath60 present in the @xmath29 . according to the attraction / repulsion criterion this produces an attractive interaction .",
    "the quark @xmath61 present in the nucleon cancels only part of the attraction to the pion .",
    "incidently the pion - nucleon @xmath113 attraction is fixed by chiral symmetry , see reference @xcite .",
    "the proposed system @xmath9 and @xmath3 are similar to the model for @xmath2(1540 ) advocated in reference @xcite , in the present case the anti - quark @xmath27 is replaced by a heavy @xmath28 or @xmath114 .",
    "the increase of the quark mass does not affect directly the attraction , where the @xmath115 is just a spectator .",
    "however the size of the wave - functions @xmath116 is affected .",
    "for instance in an harmonic oscillator potential @xmath73 is proportional to @xmath117 , and the reduced mass @xmath118 doubles when one changes from a light - light meson to a heavy - light meson .",
    "this amounts to an increase of nearly 20% of the @xmath73 in the @xmath29 or @xmath86 meson .",
    "because the @xmath73 parameter is increased only in one of the jacobi coordinates , the average @xmath73 in @xmath7 or @xmath82 or @xmath83 or @xmath84 is only expected to suffer a 10% .",
    "this increase of @xmath73 will decrease effectively the attractive interaction .",
    "for instance the condition for a 2-body binding in eq .",
    "( [ third separable ] ) shows that this is equivalent to decrease the strength of the attractive potential by a factor of 20% .",
    "similar results are obtained in different models of confinement , say in the funnel interaction which is more adequate for heavy quarks . in what concerns the repulsive @xmath77 potential ,",
    "it is decreased in the same way .",
    "moreover the strength of the hyperfine potential is further decreased because @xmath119 .",
    "for example the strength of the repulsive @xmath77 potential is expected to decrease by 30 % .",
    "i now use an adiabatic hartree method to study the stability of the linear @xmath120 molecule and related molecules with a @xmath30 , a @xmath86 or a @xmath87 .",
    "essentially the wave - function of the pion is centered between the nucleon and the @xmath29 , where the nucleon and the @xmath29 do nt overlap with each other .",
    "this results in a linear molecule .",
    "for simplicity i use an averaged mass for the nucleon and @xmath29 and for the pion interaction with these quark clusters .",
    "i solve a schrdinger equation for the nucleon in the potential produced by a pion placed at the origin and by the other heavy - light meson placed at a distance @xmath121 of the pion .",
    "the potential of the pion is produced by the @xmath29 meson at the point @xmath121 and the nucleon @xmath122 .",
    "this produces three binding energies @xmath123 , and three wave - functions . in the hartree method",
    "the total energy is the sum of these energies minus the matrix elements of the potential energies , this is easily computed once the two schrdinger equations are solved , with eqs .",
    "( [ first separable ] ) , ( [ second separable ] ) and ( [ third separable ] ) .",
    "the total energy is a function of the distance @xmath124 , and i minimize it as a function of a. the same steps are repeated for the @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 systems . at the point i am not yet able to bind these linear molecule systems , with a negative binding energy .",
    "the same happened for the @xmath128 when we studied the @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite nevertheless the picture of a @xmath15 with a binding energy of @xmath129 mev is still plausible because the medium range interaction remains to be used .",
    "therefore binding or near - binding is also plausible in the @xmath120 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 systems .",
    "i find that @xmath120 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 nearly bound i=0 linear s - wave molecules , and positive parity are plausible . the absorption of a low energy pion and the resulting decay into a low energy p - wave @xmath130 results in a narrow decay width .",
    "the @xmath125 and @xmath127 can also decay respectively into the three body systems @xmath120 and @xmath120 , but this is again narrow since the @xmath131 and @xmath132 overlaps are suppressed .",
    "moreover @xmath131 , and @xmath132 pure i=0 s - wave , negative parity , pentaquarks are not completely ruled out , but they couple strongly with the decay channels @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( repulsive systems ) , and this results in a larger width .    comparing with the @xmath15 and assuming that it is a bound system , i expect the @xmath125 and @xmath127 to be the most bound systems of the family studied in this paper , with a similar binding energy .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath125 is less bound than the @xmath128 , due to a weaker @xmath135 attraction when compared with the @xmath136 attraction .",
    "thus an energy of 14 mev above threshold , corresponding to a @xmath0 mass of 3.099 gev as observed by the the h1 collaboration is plausible .",
    "the corresponding mass of the multiquark with flavour @xmath26 is of the order of 6.416 gev .",
    "i what concerns the goundstate @xmath120 and @xmath126 the binding energy is predicted to be higher because in this case the nucleon- heavy - light meson repulsion is larger .",
    "so these states would have an energy some mev larger than respectively 2.957 gev and 6.370 gev .",
    "a more quantitative computation of the masses , sizes , and decay rates of the proposed heptaquarks , including coupled channels and exact three body computations will be done elsewhere .",
    "i expect that the most relevant contributions that remain to be included in this framework are the solution of the full three body relativistic fadeev equations , and the inclusion of the medium range interaction .",
    "the medium range interaction , which in nuclear physics is described by the sigma meson exchange , is equivalent to the coupling to channels with multiple pions .",
    "i thank gonalo marques for discussions on the algebraic computations of this paper .",
    "i am also grateful to katerina lipka and to achim geiser for discussions on the status of the experimental evidence of the @xmath137(3100 ) .    00",

    "<S> i study the charmed @xmath0 resonance @xmath1 ( 3100 ) very recently discovered by the h1 collaboration at hera . </S>",
    "<S> an anticharmed resonance was already predicted , in a recent publication mostly dedicated to the s=1 resonance @xmath2(1540 ) . to confirm these recent predictions , </S>",
    "<S> i apply the same standard quark model with a quark - antiquark annihilation constrained by chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> i find that repulsion excludes the @xmath1 ( 3100 ) as a @xmath0 s - wave pentaquark . </S>",
    "<S> i explore the @xmath1 ( 3100 ) as a heptaquark , equivalent to a @xmath3 linear molecule , with positive parity and total isospin @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> i find that the @xmath5 repulsion is cancelled by the attraction existing in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels . in our framework </S>",
    "<S> this state is harder to bind than the @xmath2 described by a @xmath8 borromean bound - state , a lower binding energy is expected in agreement with the h1 observation . </S>",
    "<S> multiquark molecules @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are also predicted . </S>"
