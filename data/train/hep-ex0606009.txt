    "babar@xcite and belle@xcite are the @xmath4 collider experiments running at @xmath5 equal to @xmath6 mass . in spite of their commonly used name",
    "_ @xmath0-factories _ they also provide largest and cleanest samples today for study of tau physics . indeed ,",
    "the cross - section of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) at this energy is 0.89  nb , of the same order as @xmath9 cross section at @xmath6 and just a bit smaller than @xmath10  nb at @xmath1 production threshold@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 event produced at @xmath6 has very characteristic topology .",
    "the decay products of two taus are well separated in space , such that if space is split on two hemispheres with respect to the axis of the event thrust , the decay products of two taus are mostly contained within opposite hemispheres . from other side , the boost is not as large as at lep experiments , and the tracks are well separated .",
    "as both babar and belle are multipurpose spectrometers , the full particle identification of the event can be performed .",
    "usually tau decays have one ( 1-prong ) or three ( 3-prong ) charged particles in the final state , therefore the multiplicity of the @xmath1 events is relatively small .",
    "the typical backgrounds are radiative bhabha and di - muon events which can be suppressed by vetoing leptons or high momentum tracks , and hadronic @xmath11 events which are more isotropic and have in average more neutral particles .",
    "currently , babar has recorded about @xmath12 tau decays , and belle has recorded about @xmath13 tau decays with large part of the statistics used in the analyzes presented below . in section  [ sec : sm ] , we review high precision measurements of tau mass and lifetime , which allow test of cpt invariance , and discuss perspectives of measuring cp - violation in tau decays .",
    "section  [ sec : sf ] is concentrated on the description of the measurements of the hadronic tau decays . in the section  [ sec : lfv ]",
    "the searches of lepton flavor violation in tau decays are described and the conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the future perspectives and limitations of different measurements are discussed throughout the paper .",
    "the basic tasks of the @xmath2-factories are to measure mass @xmath14 and time of life @xmath15 of tau lepton .",
    "belle has recently presented a preliminary measurement of @xmath16  mev@xcite using pseudo - mass technique pioneered by argus@xcite .",
    "the sample of 253  fb@xmath17 was used .",
    "although the measurement is dominated by systematic uncertainties , it is largely due to the size of the control samples , and therefore is likely to be improved with increased statistics .",
    "the sample is also used to probe the difference between @xmath18 and @xmath19 which is found to be negligible , @xmath20 at 90% confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "this number is statistically limited as most systematic uncertainties are canceled in the ratio .    at the same time babar",
    "has concentrated on the tau lifetime measurement .",
    "the flight distance transverse to the beam @xmath21 is measured and corrected by polar angle of 3-prong system ( @xmath22 ) to calculate the total decay length @xmath23 .",
    "the dependence on azimuthal angle @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is fitted to minimize the systematic uncertainties due to alignment of the vertex detector .",
    "the preliminary result is @xmath26  fs@xcite .",
    "it is in agreement with pdg value @xmath27",
    "fs@xcite and is the most precise measurement up to date .",
    "80  fb@xmath17 were used in the analysis . as in case of @xmath14 measurement , the systematic uncertainty are partially limited by statistics of control samples and is likely to be improved with luminosity , although not more than by factor of two .",
    "the preliminary study of @xmath28 and @xmath29 showed no difference @xmath30 , where the systematic uncertainty is to be estimated but likely to be small .    using the above numbers averaged with pdg values and leptonic branching fractions@xcite of tau one can compare lepton charged current coupling constants : @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are radiative corrections .",
    "no significant deviation from sm is observed .",
    "the subject which is still in _ to do _ list of both experiments is a search of @xmath36-violation in tau decays . while no such @xmath36-violation is expected in sm , other contribution , like e.g. charged higgs exchange can result in non - negligible effect in angular and visible mass distributions of tau decay products due to interference of vector and scalar parts .",
    "cleo has searched for such effect in the decays @xmath37@xcite and @xmath38@xcite with 13.3  fb@xmath17 .",
    "while no signal was found , the cleo collaboration has put limits on imaginary part of charged higgs coupling of @xmath39 from @xmath40 data assuming @xmath41 scalar contribution and @xmath42 from @xmath38 for maximal scalar contribution .",
    "the limits are at 90% cl .",
    "the largest source of the uncertainty here is the size of the sample recorded .",
    "given that @xmath0-factories have almost two orders of magnitude more data , it should be possible to improve cleo result significantly .",
    "it is clear , however , that the understanding of the systematic uncertainty will require a careful work , in particular , study of possible charge asymmetry in the detector .    of course , there are more sm tests to be performed , such as measurement of tau electric and anomalous magnetic dipole moments , michael parameters , measurement of @xmath43 helicity .",
    "however , it is unlikely , that either babar or belle will be able to improve previous measurements soon .",
    "due to simplicity of the sm tau decays involving @xmath44 exchange , it is possible to study the hadronization process in details .",
    "all hadronic tau decays are of interest , starting from the most common 1-prong @xmath38 up to not yet observed 7-prong tau decay .",
    "the analysis of spectral function of @xmath45 is to be used for comparing the measurement of anomalous magnetic moment of muon with sm prediction .",
    "the analysis of tau strange decays provides an information on mass of strange quark and @xmath3 element of ckm matrix .",
    "the 5-prong tau decays are studied with large statistics and not observed 7-prong decays are used to probe non - sm contributions .",
    "the calculation of hadronic part of the anomalous magnetic moment of muon @xmath46 includes integral of the cross - section @xmath47  hadrons multiplied with qed kernel @xmath48 .",
    "the structure of @xmath48 is such , that 75% of @xmath46 is covered by two pion final state dominated by @xmath49 resonance .",
    "assuming isospin invariance , @xmath50 can be estimated from the branching fraction @xmath51@xcite . currently , the results based on tau data together with results of muon g-2 experiment@xcite give @xmath52 , while calculation based solely on @xmath4 data is @xmath53@xcite .",
    "belle has recently presented new preliminary study of @xmath38 decay@xcite .",
