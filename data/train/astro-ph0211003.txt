    "it was once believed that elliptical galaxies were evolved objects with simple morphologies . however , early image processing techniques revealed that anywhere from one - forth to one - third of such galaxies exhibit faint morphological peculiarities in the form of shells , ripples , and extended plumes ( malin 1978 , 1979 ; malin & carter 1980 , 1983 ; schweizer & ford 1984 ; schweizer & seitzer 1988 , 1992 hereafter ss92 ; reid , boisson & sansom 1994 ) .",
    "numerical work soon demonstrated that such features could be reproduced either by small accretion events ( quinn 1984 ; dupraz & combes 1986 ; hernquist & quinn 1988 , 1989 ) or by major mergers ( hernquist & spergel 1992 ; hibbard & mihos 1995 ) .",
    "the appearance of such features in heretofore `` normal '' ellipticals is seen as strong support for the toomre merger hypothesis that ( some ) elliptical galaxies evolve from the merger of disk galaxies ( toomre & toomre 1972 , toomre 1977 ) .    in an effort to quantify the frequency and quantity of such morphological peculiarities , schweizer et al .",
    "( 1990 ) introduced a `` fine - structure index '' , @xmath1 , which increases with the amount of morphological peculiarities ( for detailed review , see schweizer 1998 ) .",
    "statistically , galaxies with larger values of @xmath1  have observational characteristics ( colors and spectral - line strengths ) consistent with the presence of younger stellar populations , supporting the idea that they represent more recent mergers in which starbursts have occurred ( schweizer et al .  1990 ; ss92 ) .",
    "this association suggests that the fine - structure index might provide a means to locate evolved merger remnants lying in the so - called `` king gap '' between @xmath2 gyr old remnants and old ellipticals ( i.  king , quoted in toomre 1977 ) .",
    "however , some recent studies have called into question the identification of ellipticals with large amounts of fine structure as aged merger remnants ( silva & bothun 1998a , 1998b ) .",
    "since such subtle morphological peculiarities may arise from less structurally damaging events , such as accretions , they are not unambiguous signatures of major mergers . to remove this ambiguity ,",
    "it is desirable to find a more direct link between a high fine - structure index and a merger origin .",
    "some clues as to the expected appearance of `` king gap '' objects are provided by observations of nearby systems which are undeniably the remnants of disk - disk mergers .",
    "the best examples of such objects are the last two members of the `` toomre sequence '' ( toomre 1977 ) , a proposed evolutionary sequence of disk - disk mergers .",
    "these two systems , ngc 3921 and ngc 7252 , are evolved merger remnants with single nuclei , post - burst stellar populations , relaxed @xmath3 light profiles , and with dynamical ages of @xmath40.51 gyr ( schweizer 1982 , 1996 , schweizer et al .  1996 , hibbard & mihos 1995 , miller et al.1997 , hibbard & yun 1999 ) .",
    "mapping of these systems with the vla shows their tidal tails to be rich in atomic hydrogen ( hibbard et al .",
    "1994 , hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) firmly establishing their status as disk - merger products .",
    "both remnants are also found to have a very low central content .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising , not only in view of large amounts of  which must have been sent into the central regions during the early stages of merging ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1991 ) , but also in view of the atomic gas - rich material that is observed streaming back into the remnant bodies from the tidal tails ( hibbard & mihos 1995 , yun & hibbard 2001 ) .",
    "these studies suggest that as the merger evolves , the remnant should have a decreasing amount of fine structure , decreasing amounts of both inner and outer tidal gas , and a multi - epoch aging stellar population .",
    "the present study is an attempt to locate products of gas - rich mergers intermediate in age between recent merger remnants like ngc 3921 & ngc 7252 and ellipticals with less obvious peculiarities .",
    "mapping of morphologically peculiar early type galaxies provides strong evidence pointing to a gas - rich merger origin for a number of objects ( e.g. schiminovich et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 ; lim & ho 1999 ; balcells et al . 2001",
    "; chang et al . 2001 ) . with this in mind ,",
    "we have targeted five ellipticals with varying amounts of optical fine structure ( @xmath1= 2.0  7.6 ) for  mapping observations with the vla in its most compact configuration ( d - array ) to look for the remnants of gas - rich tidal features in the outer regions .",
    "the five systems are ngc  3610 , ngc  3640 , ngc  4382 , ngc  5322 and ngc  7626 . in this paper",
    "we report the results of the  observations of these five galaxies .    the present paper is structured as follows . in  [ sec : sample ] we describe the selection criterion used to define the targets for this study . ",
    "[ sec : vla ] we describe the vla observations and data reduction . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we describe the results for each of the five systems , and in  [ sec : disc ] we discuss these results .",
    "finally we summarize our conclusions in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the galaxies for this study were chosen from the sample of 69 field elliptical and s0 galaxies for which the fine - structure index has been tabulated by ss92 .",
    "the fine - structure index is defined as  @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a visual estimate of the strength of the most prominent ripples , @xmath7 is the number of detected ripples , @xmath8 is the number of luminous plumes or `` jets '' , @xmath9 is a visual estimate of the maximum boxiness of isophotes , and @xmath10 indicates the absence or presence of an x - structure .",
    "the well known young ( @xmath40.51 gyr ) merger remnants ngc 3921 and ngc 7252 have @xmath1= 8.8 and 10.1 , respectively , while the sample of field s0 s and ellipticals studied by ss92 have values in the range @xmath1  = 0  7.6 .",
    "the five galaxies chosen for this study are listed in table  [ tab : vlaobs ] , along with their basic properties , group membership , fine - structure index , and observational details .",
    "we selected the three galaxies in the list of ss92 with the highest values of @xmath1  ( ngc 3610 , ngc 3640 , ngc 4382 ) .",
    "we originally chose galaxies to also cover a range of x - ray excess ( @xmath11 ) , so that we might address whether merger remnants `` grow '' x - ray halos as tidal gas falls back towards the remnant ( hibbard et al .",
    "1994 , fabbiano & schweizer 1995 , read & ponman 1998 ) .",
    "however , a re - analysis of the rosat x - ray data for these systems ( sansom , hibbard & schweizer 2000 ) shows that all but ngc 7626 are in the lowest x - ray class , so we will not address this question here . in an earlier study ( sansom , hibbard & schweizer 2000 ) , we used the present sample along with the early - type galaxies in the list of ss92 that have existing x - ray observations , to test the hypothesis that x - ray halos form as cold tidal gas falls back into the remnant bodies .",
    "we found no clear trends , other than the previously reported trend for recent merger remnants to be x - ray faint ( fabbiano & schweizer 1995 ; georgakakis , forbes & norris 2000 ; osullivan , forbes & ponman 2001 ) .",
    "the neutral hydrogen data were collected in december of 1997 using the vla in its spectral line mapping mode .",
    "the array was in its most compact d - array configuration , providing maximum sensitivity to extended emission .",
    "five galaxies and several calibrators were observed .",
    "table  [ tab : vlaobs ] gives a log of these observations .    since the atomic gas within tidal debris typically has narrow linewidths ( @xmath12510 km s@xmath13 ; hibbard et al .",
    "1994 , hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) , the correlator mode was chosen to give the smallest channel spacing while still covering the expected range of velocities for tidal gas .",
    "we therefore chose the 2ac mode with on - line hanning smoothing and a 3.125 mhz bandwidth , resulting in 63 spectral channels each of width @xmath4 10.4 km s@xmath13 and a total velocity coverage of @xmath14 km s@xmath13 .",
    "this is sufficient to cover the spread of velocities observed in other peculiar ellipticals ( @xmath15 km s@xmath13 , e.g. schiminovich et al . 1994 , 1995 , 2001 ) .",
    "most of the target ellipticals are members of loose groups or clusters ( cf . ",
    "[ sec : results ] ) and the present observations do not cover the velocity range of all group / cluster members .",
    "the field - of - view is set by the 25 m diameter of the individual array elements , and amounts to a half - power beam width ( hpbw ) of 30@xmath0 .",
    "our on - source integration time of @xmath4 2 hours per source provides an rms noise of @xmath16 mjy / beam , corresponding to a 3@xmath17 column density sensitivity of @xmath18 per channel over a typical beam size of @xmath19 ( see table [ tab : vlaobs ] ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the aips software . for each observation the absolute flux level was set by observing a standard vla flux calibrator .",
    "the antenna phases were calibrated with observations of an unresolved continuum source before and after each galaxy observation .",
    "the bandpass was calibrated using either the flux or phase calibrator , whichever provided the highest signal to noise . for details on vla observation and calibration techniques ,",
    "see taylor , carilli & perley ( 1999 ) . for",
    "the specifics of spectral line data reduction and imaging , see rupen ( 1999 ) .",
    "the spectral response of the vla resulted in 55 usable channels ( channels 357 ) out of the 63 channel datacubes .",
    "the continuum was removed using an iterative procedure which involved subtracting linear fits to the visibilities at either end of the passband .",
    "various combinations of channels were used in the fit , and the resulting datacube was mapped and reviewed to determine the range of line - free channels . in cases where  was detected from a companion at velocities significantly different from the central velocity setting , separate datacubes were made using the appropriate line - free channels for continuum subtraction .",
    "the data were mapped using a  robust \" weighting parameter of + 1 ( briggs 1995 ) , which provides good sensitivity to faint extended emission .",
    "continuum intensity and continuum - subtracted line maps were made of the entire primary beam .",
    "the line maps were cleaned using the standard methods in aips . to further increase our sensitivity , we smoothed the data first in velocity by a factor of four , then spatially by convolving to a resolution of 90@xmath20 .",
    "no further detections were made in either of the smoothed datasets and all figures presented here use the full resolution datacubes .",
    "neutral hydrogen masses are calculated according to the equation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the distance to the source in mpc , @xmath23 is the continuum subtracted  line specific intensity in janskys , @xmath24 is the velocity expressed in km s@xmath13 .",
    "the integral is over the line , assuming the atomic gas to be optically thin .",
    "@xmath25 is then in units of @xmath26 per beam . where no detections were made , six sigma upper limits were estimated from the velocity smoothed datacube ( i.e. over an  linewith of 42 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "masses or mass limits for each of the targets are listed in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "previous limits for these galaxies were typically @xmath27 m@xmath28 from single dish observations ( roberts et al .",

    "group assignment was assessed using the loose galaxy groups catalog ( garcia 1993 , hereafter lgg ) , and the number of group members was evaluated via the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "this information is summarized in table  [ tab : vlaobs ] .",
    "we review the morphological properties of each system , listing the values for the fine - structure index and the `` heuristic merger age '' , as tabulated by ss92 .",
    "the heuristic merger age was calculated by matching a simple two - burst model of evolving stellar populations to the observed @xmath30 colors ( see ss92 for details ) .",
    "we also report spectroscopically determined age estimates available from the literature . in most cases ,",
    "these are derived from single stellar populations ( ssp ) model fits to four or more spectroscopically derived metallicity- and age - dependent line indicies ( see e.g. gonzales 1993 , worthey 1994 ) , and represent a luminosity - weighted mean age for the central stellar population . we briefly describe the results of previous  observations ( culled from the compilations of huchtmeier & richter 1989 and martin 1998 ) .",
    "we note that our vla observations are most sensitive to narrow  lines , and may miss  emission spread over a broad range of velocity . for such emission",

    "this will not effect our detection sensitivity , since this difference is well within the observed band .",
    "ngc 3610 has the highest value of @xmath1  of any of the early types in the ss92 sample ( @xmath1=7.60 , heuristic merger age 47 gyr ) .",

    "the optical peculiarities include two or three shells , a central ` x'-structure , plumes , and extraordinarily boxy outer isophotes ( forbes & thomson 1992 , whitmore et al.1997 ) . while the outer isophotes are boxy , the inner isophotes are disky , due to a inner disk embedded within its spheroid ( scorza & bender 1990 ) . the system as a whole is rotationally flattened ( @xmath32 ; scorza & bender 1990 ) , and the inner disk is kinematically distinct , with @xmath33 ( rix & white 1992 ) .",
    "there is no color differences between the main body and the inner disk , and both seem to be comprised of stars with similar ages ( scorza & bender 1990 ; whitmore et al .",

    "m@xmath7086 ( a.k.a .",
    "ngc 4406 ) is a large early type galaxy in the virgo cluster .",
    "it has an x - ray `` tail '' to the northwest and an  cloud to the south , outside the main body of m@xmath7086 ( li & van gorkom 2001 ) .",
    "ngc 7626 may also bear some resemblance to the radio galaxy coma a , where  has been detected in absorption against the radio lobes , some @xmath430 kpc from the galaxy center ( morganti et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "while there are systems similar to ngc 7626 , the nature of the intergalactic  clouds is not at all clear .",
    "they could be diffuse remnant tidal debris which only remains neutral far outside of the body of the elliptical , becoming photoionized by the stellar population at smaller radii ( hibbard , vacca & yun 2000 ) ; or they could be a result of complex multiphase hydrodynamics , such as a jet - ism , jet - icm , or galaxy - icm interaction . in this respect",
    ", x - ray imaging of the pegasus group would be very instructive .",
    "we expected a fair detection rate in these high @xmath1ellipticals .",
    "this presumption was based primarily on two considerations : ( 1 ) peculiar e / so galaxies have a 45%  detection rate ( bregman , hogg , & roberts 1992 ; van gorkom & schiminovich 1997 ) , and ( 2 ) the expectation that the highest @xmath1  systems would be the youngest remnants of disk mergers , and therefore most likely to still have gas - rich tidal debris . therefore , we were somewhat surprised that only one of the five fine - structure galaxies that we targeted was detected in . moreover , the detected system , ngc 7626 , is on the low end of the @xmath1  scale , and we failed to detect  in the three highest @xmath1  systems in the compilation of ss92 ( ngc 3610 , ngc 3640 and ngc 4384 ) .    while the number of systems that we observed in the present program is much too small to draw any statistical conclusions , in our previous study ( sansom , hibbard & schweizer 2000 ) we examined all of the available  mapping data for galaxies in the lists of ss92 .",
    "we found that 17/37 ( 46%@xmath7216% ) were detected in  ( i.e. , the same fraction as found by bregman et al .  for peculiar e / s0s ) .",
    "the  morphology suggests a tidal origin in all but three of these detections .",
    "however , the ss92 compilation includes early types with a wide range of @xmath1 .",
    "when plotting cold and hot gas properties versus @xmath1 , we find no correlation besides the previously known tendency for recent ( @xmath713 gyr ) merger remnants to be x - ray faint ( fabbiano & schweizer 1995 ; georgakakis , forbes & norris 2000 ; osullivan , forbes & ponman 2001 , see also http://www.star.uclan.ac.uk/@xmath4aes/gals/ism.html ) .",
    "one possibility is that tidal  does not survive for as long in the outer regions as inferred from studies of young , more isolated merger remnants ( hibbard & mihos 1995 ) .",
    "another possibility is that a high fine structure index does not unambiguously identify recent disk - disk merger remnants .",
    "we look at each of these possibilities in turn .",
    "regarding the longevity of tidal material , in their dynamic study of the merger remnant ngc 7252 , hibbard & mihos ( 1995 ) found that the outermost -rich material should remain at large radii from the remnant , evolving on timescales of several gyr .",
    "however , that study only considered the effects of gravity , and did not address the survivability of the gas in its neutral form . as the tidal debris evolves , it becomes more diffuse .",
    "at low  column densities , this gas may be susceptible to ionization by the intergalactic uv field ( hill 1974 , bland - hawthorn & maloney 1999 ) , or even by the stellar population of the remnant ( hibbard , vacca & yun 2000 ) .",
    "perhaps more importantly , ngc 7252 is a relatively isolated system , while the five systems studied here are in groups or clusters . in such environments ,",
    "the crossing times are of the same order as the timescale for tidal evolution , and it may be difficult for tidal  to maintain a coherent morphology for very long ( see also verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "we believe these effects contribute to the lack of detectable tidal  in the targeted galaxies . in this case , such gas should give rise to extensive ionized haloes around galaxies ( morris & van den bergh 1994 , tadhunter et al .",
    "2000 ) , which may be detectable in absorption against background sources ( e.g. norman et al .",
    "1996 , carilli & van gorkom 1993 ) .",
    "if we could accurately date the time since the merger , it would help evaluate the likelihood of this posibility .    regarding the ability of a high fine - structure index to pick out the youngest merger remnant",
    ", we re - evaluate the relationship between fine - structure index and population age indicators derived by ss92 .",
    "the heuristic merger ages tabulated by ss92 were based on broad band @xmath30 colors , which are not straight forward to interpret in terms of ages , because of age - metallicity degeneracies , non - solar abundances and ratios , line emission , dust , frosting of a young population , etc .",
    "( see worthey 1994 and proctor & sansom 2002 for discussions of some of these effects ) .",
    "spectroscopic ages are now available using several line indicies sensitive to both age and metallicity .",
    "we therefore re - evaluate the relationship between fine - structure index and population age using these new age indicators .",
    "for our age indicators , we use the sample of early type galaxies with uniform quality line - strength data assembled from the literature by tf02 , for which luminosity weighted ages have been determined using the ssp models of worthey ( 1994)/8 of the systems , where @xmath73 is the effective radius of the galaxy , and therefore are most sensitive to the ages of the central stellar population . ] .",
    "we emphasize that these are not absolute ages , but age indicators : derived ages will differ for different models , but the relative age ranking should be be maintained ( see tf02 for a discussion of these points ) .",
    "we therefore do not augment this sample by including galaxies with merger ages estimated by a different method .",
    "figure [ fig : sigage ] shows how the fine - structure index compares with the logarithm of the spectroscopically determined ages ( log [ age@xmath74 ) for the 26 galaxies in the tf02 sample which also have fine - structure quantified by ss92 .",
    "a statistical test on @xmath1  and age@xmath75 for these 26 systems shows that they are highly anti - correlated ( spearman rank - order correlation coefficient @xmath76=-0.70 ) .",
    "however , the correlation drops when the young merger remnants ngc 3921 and ngc 7252 are dropped from the sample ( @xmath76=-0.62 ) . unlike the other systems in the ss92 sample ,",
    "these two systems were included based on their status as known merger remnants .",
    "further analysis indicates that most of the anti - correlation between @xmath1  and age@xmath75 comes from systems with high @xmath1(@xmath774 ) and young ages ( @xmath713 gyr ; @xmath76=-0.83 ) ; the rank order correlation coefficient drops to @xmath76=-0.14 for systems with lower @xmath1  and higher age@xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the apparent anti - correlation may be due to the purposeful inclusion of the well - known merger remnants ngc 7252 and ngc 3921 by both ss92 and tf02 at the high-@xmath1 , low spectroscopic age end , and to the very few systems with a fine - structure index in the range @xmath78 .",
    "indeed , three of our systems fall within the range : ngc 3610 , ngc 3640 , ngc 4382 ( table  [ tab : vlaobs ] ) .",
    "ngc 4382 is one of the points in the plot , while ngc 3610 and ngc 3640 would lie well above the apparent relationship if the age indicators given in  [ sec : results ] are taken ( i.e. , 47 gyr for ngc 3610 , and 68 gyr for ngc 3640 ) .",
    "so while fig .",
    "[ fig : sigage ] reinforces the use of fine structure for tracking dynamically young remnants , it would be more reassuring to have more objects with a high fine - structure , and to have better age indicators than luminosity weighted mean ages .    in conclusion",
    ", we can not say unambiguously that the five fine - structure ellipticals studied here are `` king gap '' objects ( i.e. , evolved remnants of major disk - disk mergers ) .",
    "they may indeed be the result of gas - rich mergers , but evolved enough that any tidal gas that was thrown out during the encounter has fallen back , dispersed , or been converted to other forms .",
    "however , they may have had quite different histories , including minor mergers or major mergers of gas - poor progenitors .",
    "together , these results suggest that progenitor type , encounter geometry , and local environment may all play an important role in the expected post - merger evolution , and that there is not one simple path from disk mergers to old ellipticals ( see also hibbard et al . 2001a ; verdes - montenegro et al . 2001 ) .",
    "these possibilities can only be constrained by investigating young objects in the so - called `` king gap '' . to this end ,",
    "[ fig : sigage ] offers some hope .",
    "clearly , interacting systems may evolve in many ways in this plane , depending on what merged and how many stars , if any , were made during the interaction .",
    "less drastic interacting histories may leave remnants anywhere along the right hand side of this plot , making it harder to determine the origin of such systems .",
    "however , major mergers of gas - rich systems _ must _ evolve from the lower left of the plot to the upper right .",
    "it is not clear _ how _ remnants will evolve in this plane , or whether @xmath1  and spectroscopically determined ssp ages are the best parameters to evaluate : @xmath1  may not properly capture the dynamical evolution of the optical peculiarities and , given the range of possible progenitors and encounter geometries , perhaps no single parameter can ; additionally , mergers of gas rich systems may have complicated star formation histories ( e.g. mihos & hernquist 1996 ) that are poorly constrained by simple stellar population models ( see also liu & green 1996 ) , and luminosity weighted mean population ages may only be roughly related to the time since the latest merger event ( hibbard et al .",
    "but the above considerations reinforce the suggestion of ss92 that signs of both dynamical youth and a youthful population should be used to identify the youngest `` king gap '' objects .",
    "we detected neutral hydrogen in the vicinity of four of the five fine - structure e / so galaxies which we observed with the vla d - array . in only one case",
    "is the  directly associated with the targeted elliptical .",
    "for this one case , ngc 7626 , there is a tentative detection of  outside the optical body of the galaxy .",
    "this system contains a kinematically distinct core , but no obvious signs of being a recent merger , and its stellar population is uniformly old ( at least as indicated by ssp determined ages ) .",
    "therefore the origin of the  is unclear , but similar systems are known from the literature .    combining the present results with the analysis of sansom , hibbard & schweizer 2000",
    ", we find that galaxies with a large value of the fine - structure parameter , @xmath1 , are no more likely to be detected in  than those with a low value of @xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that if the high @xmath1  ellipticals are aged remnants of disk - disk mergers , their tidal  did not survive longer than a few gyrs .",
    "this may be due to the short crossing time in the group environment , and/or due to ionization of the  as it becomes more diffuse .",
    "this gas would contributed to a very diffuse neutral or ionized halo around the remnants .",
    "given these results , we conclude that the most promising way to constrain the observational characteristics of aged remnants of _ gas - rich _ mergers would be to target younger `` king gap '' objects ( ages @xmath712 gyr ) which contain signatures of both a dynamical youth and a youthful central stellar population .",
    "a growing population of objects is being identified , both by the appearance of optical and gaseous tidal features ( e.g. schiminovich et al .",
    "2001 , chang et al .",
    "2001 , hibbard et al .",
    "2001a ) , and by spectroscopic studies of peculiar or normal early type galaxies ( e.g. bergval , ronnback & johansson 1989 ; oegerle , hill & hoessel 1991 ; zabludoff et al . 1996 ; longhetti et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; hau et al . 1999 ; trager et al .",
    "2000 ; georgakakis et al . 2001 ; tf02 ; proctor & sansom 2002 ) .",
    "once a population of recent merger remnants is identified , they would enable us to judge the appearance of merger remnants at ages of @xmath772 gyr . by examining the cold gas content and distribution , global colors and line indicies , inner / outer color differences , and light profiles of such systems",
    ", we could evaluate whether they are likely to evolve into normal ellipticals , or if instead they will leave long - lived signatures of their merger origin ( mihos & hernquist 1994 , hibbard & yun 1999 , van den marel & zurek 2000 , mihos 2001 ) . by identifying the expected observational signatures along the post - merger path we may ultimately be able to determine the fraction of the elliptical galaxy population which had a merger origin .",
