    "<S> a striking feature of the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field is the existence of a vacuum energy and of zero - point fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> field fluctuations have observable effects such as the lamb shift , spontaneous emission , casimir - polder forces , and the casimir effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , casimir - polder forces are long - range electromagnetic interactions between neutral polarizable atoms or molecules ( van der waals interaction ) , or between an atom and a macroscopic object , that arise from the zero - point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and matter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their prediction is arguably one of the most important results of quantum electrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the macroscopic counterpart of the casimir - polder forces is the casimir effect , predicting an attractive force between two parallel uncharged plates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between the casimir effect and casimir - polder forces has been extensively investigated in the literature , highlighting fundamental properties such as the nonadditivity @xcite and fluctuations ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> experiments conducted from the second half of the nineties to now , have incontrovertibly shown the reality of these rather counterintuitive effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is now recognized that the casimir effect plays an important role in the operation of micro- and nano - electromechanical devices ( mems and nems ) @xcite . in particular , the research of experimental setups that allow for a modulation of the intensity or the sign of the force is of great interest as it may help to prevent the jamming ( ` stiction ' ) of such machinery due to attractive forces , leading to the breakdown of the device . in the field of miniaturized atom traps , </S>",
    "<S> the control over the casimir - polder attraction is desirable to achieve stable trapping at distances below one micron@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , great attention has been paid to the so - called dynamic casimir effect . here </S>",
    "<S> , theory predicts that forcing a plate to a rapid mechanical oscillatory motion leads to the generation of real photons from the electromagnetic vacuum state ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . the phenomenon has not yet been confirmed by experiments directly . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for a measurable number of real photons to be produced , the wall must oscillate at frequencies that are not experimentally accessible , yet . </S>",
    "<S> however , alternative schemes for the realization of the dynamic casimir effect have been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the mechanical movement of the wall may be replaced by a suitable modulation of the optical properties of one of the surfaces @xcite or of the optical path length of a cavity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> analogous effects have been recently observed in the context of superconducting circuits @xcite and in trapped bose - einstein condensates @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic counterpart of the dynamic casimir effect is the dynamic casimir - polder effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent work has studied the dynamic casimir - polder forces between an atom and a perfectly reflecting plate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that after a sudden change of the atom - field interaction parameters , the force exhibits oscillations in time and can be attractive or repulsive depending on time and the atom - wall distance . </S>",
    "<S> this is at variance with the stationary atom - plate casimir - polder force for a ground - state atom , which is generally attractive at all distances between the atom and the plate . </S>",
    "<S> a description in terms of a perfectly reflecting plate obviously neglects the dynamics of charge transport @xcite and does not take into account phenomena such as uv transparency and surface - mode excitations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , these are known to play a crucial role in the near - field of conducting surfaces , and in particular in short - distance atom - surface interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore generalize previous work on the dynamic casimir - polder interaction from the case of perfectly reflecting surfaces to allow for the description of an arbitrary surface material in terms of optical response functions .    </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we investigate the dynamic ( i.e. , time - dependent ) casimir - polder force between a neutral atom and a real surface and follow its relaxation towards a new equilibrium quantum state ( `` atom dressing '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a situation can occur when a parameter involved in the atom - field coupling ( such as the atomic transition frequency or the atom - plate distance ) is suddenly modified @xcite ; in this case a time dependence of the force is expected . </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider two different initial conditions for the system : an initially bare atom , and a partially dressed one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter scenario occurs if a nonadiabatic change of the atomic properties is externally induced , for example by an external electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the time - dependent atom dressing and the resulting atom - surface casimir - polder potential , and discuss how the physical properties of the surface material can influence the time dependence of the casimir - polder force , in particular its intensity and sign . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected , because the surface can respond to the field generated by the atom and participate in the dynamics of the system , in particular through surface excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained in the two cases are compared with those already obtained in the literature for the limiting case of an ideal reflecting plate . </S>",
    "<S> we find that also in the case of a general surface , the dynamic casimir - polder energy exhibits oscillations in time , yielding a transient repulsive force , and that asymptotically settles to its stationary value . </S>",
    "<S> combining time - dependent perturbation theory with the matter - assisted field approach @xcite , we evaluate the effects on the dynamic dressing caused by the metallic surface with a focus on the role of surface excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism makes it possible to explore realistic situations close to those experimentally achievable , and it may also allow us to determine whether specific physical properties of the wall can be used to control the atomic dressing time and hence the intensity or the sign of the casimir - polder force .    </S>",
