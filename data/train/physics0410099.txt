    "<S> an experiment measuring the @xmath0 lamb shift in muonic hydrogen @xmath1 is being performed at the paul scherrer institute , switzerland . </S>",
    "<S> it requires small and compact detectors for 1.9  kev x  rays ( @xmath2@xmath3 transition ) with an energy resolution around 25% at 2  kev , a time resolution better than 100  ns , a large solid angle coverage , and insensitivity to a 5  t magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen large area avalanche photodiodes ( laapds ) from radiation monitoring devices as x  ray detectors , and they were used during the last data taking period in 2003 . for x  ray spectroscopy applications , these laapds have to be cooled in order to suppress the dark current noise , hence , a series of tests were performed to choose the optimal operation temperature . specifically , the temperature dependence of gain , energy resolution , dark current , excess noise factor , and detector response linearity was studied . </S>",
