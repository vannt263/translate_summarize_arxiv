    "the dual formulation of the ginzburg - landau gives a similar representation of the partition function as the path integral ( [ eloops ] ) ; however this time not in terms of electric current , but of magnetic vortex loops . to derive it",
    ", we start with a trick @xcite and introduce a ( hypothetical ) magnetic monopole at some point @xmath226 inside the superconductor .",
    "a monopole is a source of magnetic flux . due to the meissner effect ,",
    "the flux lines emanating from the monopole are squeezed into a flux tube . in this way",
    ", we managed to create a magnetic vortex at zero external field .",
    "electrodynamics in the presence of a monopole was first described by dirac @xcite who argued that the physical local magnetic induction @xmath227 is given by the combination @xmath228 .",
    "the subtracted plastic field @xmath229 with @xmath230 the magnetic flux quantum , removes the field of the so - called dirac string running along some path @xmath231 from the location @xmath226 of the monopole to infinity . on account of stokes theorem , the plastic field satisfies the equation @xmath232 with @xmath233 the monopole density .",
    "we continue by writing @xmath234 as @xmath235 where @xmath236 is a constant solution of the mean - field equation .",
    "this approximation , where the phase of the order field is allowed to vary in space while the modulus is kept fixed , is called the london limit .",
    "the ginzburg - landau hamiltonian then becomes after integrating out the phase field @xmath237 : @xmath238 where @xmath239 is the inverse magnetic penetration depth @xmath240 .",
    "we gave @xmath241 the superscript @xmath154 to indicate the presence of the monopole .",
    "while the dirac string is immaterial in the normal phase , nambu @xcite argued that it acquires physical relevance in the superconducting phase where it serves as the core of the magnetic vortex or abrikosov flux tube originating at the monopole .",
    "the energy @xmath242 of this configuration is easily obtained by substituting the solution of the field equation for the gauge field @xmath243_j,\\ ] ] with @xmath244 the gauge - field green function @xmath245 back into the hamiltonian ( [ hp ] ) .",
    "the energy is divergent in the ultraviolet because in the london limit , where the mass @xmath246 of the @xmath217-field is taken to be infinite , the vortices are considered to be ideal lines . for a finite mass",
    ", a vortex core has a typical width of the order of the coherence length @xmath247 .",
    "this mass therefore provides a natural ultraviolet cutoff to the theory . omitting the irrelevant ( diverging ) monopole self - interaction",
    ", one finds @xcite @xmath248 here , @xmath249 while @xmath231 denotes the ( infinite ) length of the dirac string and @xmath250 its line tension , first calculated by abrikosov @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath251 of the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath252 separates the type - ii regime @xmath253 , where isolated vortices can exist , from the type - i regime @xmath254 , where a partial penetration of an external field is impossible . remembering that @xmath231 was the dirac string , we see from ( [ moncon ] ) that in the superconducting phase it indeed becomes the core of the magnetic vortex originating at the monopole , as was first observed by nambu @xcite .    the operator @xmath255 describing the monopole with its emerging flux tube @xcite is easily constructed by noting that in the functional - integral approach , a given field configuration is weighted with a boltzmann factor @xmath256 , with the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ hp ] ) . from this",
    "we infer that the explicit form of the vortex operator is @xmath257 \\right\\}.\\ ] ]    we next demonstrate that this operator can be used to distinguish the superconducting from the normal phase @xcite . to this end",

    "since all the integrals involved are gaussian , this expectation value can be evaluated directly .",
    "we proceed , however , in an indirect way for reasons that will become clear when we proceed , and first linearize the functional integral over the gauge field by introducing an auxiliary field @xmath262 . in the gauge @xmath263 , which corresponds to setting @xmath264 in the hamiltonian ( [ hp ] )",

    "the integral over the vector potential is easily carried out by substituting the field equation for @xmath182 , @xmath269 back into ( [ vdu ] ) , with the result @xmath270 - i \\int_{\\bf x } \\tilde{\\bf h } \\cdot { \\bf b}^{\\rm p } \\right\\}.\\ ] ] this shows that the magnetic vortex described by the plastic field @xmath271 couples to the fluctuating massive vector field @xmath272 , with a coupling constant @xmath130 introduced in eq .",

    "fig : biotsavart ] ) .    for the renormalized operators we find @xmath278 where @xmath279 denotes the length of the flux tube connecting the monopole at @xmath280 with the antimonopole at @xmath281 .",
    "initially , the two dirac strings may run to infinity along two arbitrary paths . due to the string tension , however , they join on the shortest path @xmath282 connecting the monopoles .",
    "the correlation function ( [ correlation ] ) behaves differently in the two phases . in the superconducting phase , where @xmath283 , the first factor dominates .",
    "it represents the confining linear potential between the monopole and the antimonopole . as a result",
    ", the correlation function decays exponentially for distances larger than @xmath284 : @xmath285 on the other hand , in the normal phase , where the gauge field is massless , the confinement factor in the correlation function ( [ correlation ] ) disappears , while the argument of the second exponential turns into a pure coulomb potential .",
    "the correlation function remains , consequently , finite for large distances : @xmath286 thus indicating a proliferation of magnetic vortices in the normal phase .",
    "this demonstrates that the vortex operator can be used as an order parameter to distinguish the two phases . since it develops a vacuum expectation value not in the superconducting , but in the normal phase it is referred to as a _ disorder _",
    "parameter .",
    "it is interesting to consider in detail the limit @xmath287 , where the coupling constant @xmath288 tends to zero and the magnetic vortex decouples from the massive vector field @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ vdua ] ) , this limit yields the constraint @xmath289 which can be solved by setting @xmath290 .",
    "the correlation function then takes the simple form @xmath291.\\ ] ] in the absence of monopoles , the theory reduces to that of a free gapless mode @xmath292 that may be thought of as representing the magnetic scalar potential : @xmath293 this follows from combining the physical interpretation of the vector field @xmath227 ( [ phys ] ) with the equation @xmath294 .    the correlation function ( [ dual : simple ] ) can be put in the form @xmath295 } \\right\\rangle,\\ ] ] where the average at the right - hand side is taken with respect to the free scalar theory .",
    "this equation shows that in the normal phase ( @xmath296 ) , the dirac string looses its physical relevance , the right - hand side depending only on the end points @xmath226 and @xmath281 , not on the path @xmath279 connecting these points .",
    "the notion of a magnetic vortex is of no relevance in this phase because the vortices proliferate and carry no energy .",
    "this is the reason for omitting any reference to vortex lines in the argument of @xmath100 in eqs .",
    "( [ dual : simple ] ) and ( [ localrep ] ) .      from the above results for a single vortex",
