    "are liberated ( deconfined ) , contrary to the low temperature phase that confines color charges inside colorless objects such as hadrons or glueballs .",
    "the existence of confined and deconfined phases has been demonstrated numerically in lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) studies @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd predicts a first - order phase transition for su(3 ) pure gauge theory @xcite that turns into a crossover for full qcd  @xcite with physical quark masses .    a collision of two heavy nuclei at high energy releases a large number of gluons from the wave functions of the colliding nuclei  @xcite .",
    "those gluons interact and eventually form a thermalized qcd plasma with a temperature in excess of the critical temperature for deconfinement .",
    "complete ( and consistent ) theoretical understanding of the thermalization process is presently lacking .",
    "baier , mueller , schiff and son developed the so - called `` bottom - up '' approach  @xcite , which is a framework for understanding the processes leading to thermalization and for calculating the thermalization time of the qcd medium as well as its initial temperature ( see , however , the critique in ref .",
    "the `` bottom - up '' approach is based on solving the boltzmann equation for quasi - particles in a trivial vacuum and neglects the structure of the deconfined phase of the non - abelian gauge theory arising from the z(3 ) center symmetry discovered by t  hooft and polyakov  @xcite .",
    "below , we shall show that in a model which allows for non - perturbatively large variations of polyakov loops in space , domain walls form which separate regions of different z(3 ) orientation  @xcite .",
    "the competition between such domains affects the thermalization of long - wavelength modes of the polyakov loop .",
    "we shall also provide some model estimates for the relevant wave lengths and time scales .",
    "we adopt a simplified picture where a relativistic heavy - ion collision is viewed as a quench that instantly heats the system to a temperature above the deconfining temperature .",
    "the response of polyakov loop structure factors ( sfs ) to such a heating quench has been studied in su(3 ) lgt by markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulations for glauber ( dissipative ) dynamics  @xcite . as unambiguous signals for the transition one",
    "finds a dynamical growth of the sf , reaching maxima which scale approximately with the volume , a behavior often characterized as spinodal decomposition  @xcite .",
    "glauber ( model  a ) dynamics  @xcite imitates the thermal fluctuation of nature .",
    "it is therefore expected to describe the dissipative features of the transition from one equilibrium ensemble to another well .",
    "mcmc updating with a metropolis or heatbath algorithm falls into the universality class of model  a. such su(3 ) mcmc simulations converge to 3d equilibrium ensembles , which are the same as in minkowski space , because the fourth extension of the euclidean lattice serves only to define the temperature .",
    "the major drawback of glauber dynamics is not the 4d euclidean formulation but that it is non - relativistic and , more importantly , that one does not know how to connect the mcmc updating step to a physical time scale .",
    "it was stressed in @xcite that relaxation to the vacuum ensemble at high temperature becomes feasible only after each sf has overcome its maximum value . for su(3 )",
    "gauge theory this relaxation time diverges with increasing system size due to competing order - order domains with different z(3 ) center group triality , which are similar to order - order domains in a 3-state potts model  @xcite .",
    "this divergence is well known in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "hence , one should not a - priori exclude the possibility that , under heating , the long wavelength modes in the system do not equilibrate but instead get stuck in the neighborhood of the sf maxima .    in this paper",

    "they reduce the sf maxima and decrease the relaxation time , as has been demonstrated qualitatively for the 3d 3-state potts model  @xcite in an external magnetic field , while counter effects may come from the accompanying decrease of the transition temperature @xmath9 and the transformation of the phase transition into a crossover  @xcite .    to improve the simulations",
    ", one could drop the assumption of instantaneous quenching and replace it by the thermalization time of the hard modes .",
    "the spinodal decomposition process starts already during the quench when the central rapidity volume heats up , and it occurs in an expanding medium where the longitudinal wave vectors experience a red - shift  @xcite .",
    "moreover , boundary conditions in heavy - ion collisions are not periodic as used in this paper ; rather , the surrounding vacuum is confined and therefore disordered .",
    "this increases the width and the effective temperature for the deconfinement transition in a volume - dependent way . in a su(3 )",
    "equilibrium study the increase in temperature was found to be in the range from 20% for a volume of @xmath125 to 5% for a volume of @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "due to all of the above caveats , our numbers should be viewed only as rough first estimates .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that away from the extreme weak - coupling limit ( @xmath20 ) the dynamics of competing domains will influence thermalization of long wavelength modes , perhaps even for @xmath1 not very far below @xmath2 , and hence can not be neglected .",

    "<S> we determine the time evolution of fluctuations of the polyakov loop after a quench into the deconfined phase of su(3 ) gauge theory from a simple classical relativistic lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the structure factors , which indicate spinodal decomposition followed by relaxation , to those obtained via markov chain monte carlo techniques in su(3 ) lattice gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the time when the structure factor peaks diverges like @xmath0 in the long - wavelength limit . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to formation of competing z(3 ) domains for configurations where the polyakov loop exhibits non - perturbatively large variations in space , which delay thermalization of long wavelength modes . for realistic temperatures , and away from the extreme weak - coupling limit , we find that even modes with @xmath1 on the order of @xmath2 experience delayed thermalization . </S>",
    "<S> relaxation times of very long wavelength modes are found to be on the order of the size of the system ; thus , the dynamics of competing domains should accompany the hydrodynamic description of the deconfined vacuum . </S>"
