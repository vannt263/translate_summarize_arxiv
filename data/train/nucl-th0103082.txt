    "the question about the modifications of the vector meson properties in the nuclear medium has received a vivid attention during the last years ( cf . refs .",
    "@xcite ) . whereas the @xmath9-meson is expected to practically dissolve already at normal nuclear matter density @xmath10 , the @xmath0-meson is expected to survive as a quasi - particle at densities @xmath11 , i.e. in ordinary nuclei .",
    "a meson or baryon resonance produced in a pion or proton induced reaction on nuclei can decay outside or inside the target nucleus .",
    "correspondingly , the invariant mass distribution of the decay products for each resonance contains two components @xcite .",
    "the first component is described by a breit - wigner formula with vacuum properties of the resonance mass @xmath12 and width @xmath13 .",
    "the second component is strongly distorted by the nuclear medium due to a collisional broadening @xmath14 and a possible mass shift @xmath15 , where in first approximation @xmath14 and @xmath15 are proportional to the nuclear density . in principle , medium modifications of @xmath16 mesons can be detected directly by measuring the dilepton invariant mass spectra in @xmath17 and @xmath18 collisions ( see e.g. refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the advantages of this method are related to the fact that the dilepton mass spectra are almost undistorted by the final state interactions .",
    "however , the @xmath16-signal in the dilepton mode is rather weak ( @xmath19 ) and is always accompanied by a comparatively large background from @xmath20 decays . from this point of view",
    "it is useful to consider also the @xmath21 decay which has a branching ratio of about 3 orders of magnitude higher ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the effect of the @xmath16 mass shift in the @xmath22 invariant mass distribution can be identified on top of the background which is related to @xmath23 rescattering events .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss in more detail the in - medium @xmath0 decay to an off - shell @xmath3 and a photon and investigate additional criteria to separate the @xmath24 signal in @xmath25 collisions at gev energies from different sources of background such as @xmath26 or @xmath27 when one photon from the meson decays is not detected or misidentified ..    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we will briefly discuss the propagation of a resonance in the nuclear medium , its decay to an off - shell pion and a photon and describe the intranuclear cascade ( inc ) model that is used in the simulation of events for the reaction @xmath28 . in section 3 we present the results of our calculations and summarize our work in section 4 .",
    "we here consider the production of @xmath0-resonances in @xmath25- collisions not far above the threshold . due to the kinematics of the production process",

    "the corresponding green function , which describes the propagation of the resonance from the point @xmath29 ( where it is produced ) to the point @xmath30 ( where it decays or rescatters incoherently ) can be written as @xcite @xmath31d\\zeta\\ } \\times \\delta(\\vec{b}-\\vec{b}^{\\prime})\\theta(z^{\\prime}-z),\\ ] ] where the @xmath32-axis is directed along the resonance momentum @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the impact parameter and @xmath35 is the inverse resonance propagator , while @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the resonance mass and width in the vacuum . the four - momentum @xmath38 in ( [ delta ] ) can be defined through the four - momenta of the resonance decay products , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the pion 4-momentum in the medium ( cf .",

    "since we consider energies not far above threshold for @xmath0 production , the @xmath0 can be produced in the first hard proton - nucleon collision or through the two - step mechanism with an intermediate production of a pion @xcite : @xmath51 .",

    "the production amplitude is obtained by replacing @xmath52 in ( 5 ) by @xmath53 and @xmath54 by the pion propagator @xmath55 .",
    "in addition an integration over all pion production points has to be performed .",
    "if the resonance decays outside the nucleus , the amplitude for @xmath1 production  in case of the primary production channel  can be written as @xmath56 where the contributions from the resonance decays inside and outside the nucleus can be expressed as @xmath57}{\\delta^*},\\ ] ] and @xmath58}{\\delta}\\ ] ] with @xmath59 eq .",

    "= @xmath137 , where one plane is formed by the initial proton momentum and the @xmath138 momentum ( @xmath178 ) and the second one is formed by the initial proton momentum and the @xmath4 momentum ( @xmath179 . we have demonstrated that the distribution in this azimuthal angle provides quite selective criteria for a separation of the in - medium effect .",
    "we also have investigated , how different kinematical cuts can increase the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "the in - medium modifications are found to be most pronounced for the cuts on the total and transverse momentum of the @xmath112 system @xmath1610.5 gev / c , @xmath1530.2 gev / c and in the azimuthal angle @xmath154 = @xmath155= @xmath156 . for example , the ratio @xmath180 calculated for @xmath121 ( @xmath158 ) at @xmath113 = 2.4 gev without cuts changes from 0.029 ( 0.008 )  when medium effects are absent  to 0.128 ( 0.059 ) when both medium effects -collisional broadening and mass shift - are included .",
    "the calculations with cuts give the ratio @xmath157=0.033 ( 0.020 ) without medium effects and 0.401 ( 0.183 ) with collisional broadening @xmath181 and mass shift @xmath182 included .",
    "therefore , the study of in - medium effects for @xmath0-mesons via the @xmath1 decay mode in @xmath25 collisions in the near threshold region appears very promising ."
