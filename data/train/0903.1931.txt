    "the phase - fluctuation contribution to the density vanishes at the phase boundary between the paired state and the normal state , because at @xmath69 the superfluid density @xmath77 turns to zero .",
    "finally , the approximation of setting @xmath72 in ( [ number ] ) does not allow to determine whether the superfluid quasicondensate can form a true condensate below some critical temperature @xmath78 .",
    "note that the emergence of a true condensate is only possible in a finite system , as @xmath79 for @xmath80 . to determine the critical temperature we should use @xmath81 in ( [ number ] ) , where @xmath82 contains contributions from _ both _ amplitude and phase fluctuations in the hubbard - stratonovic bose field",
    "when @xmath83 , equation ( [ tkt ] ) can be satisfied if the superfluid density @xmath84 . at @xmath75 ,",
    "the superfluid density for a balanced fermi gas turns to zero .",
    "therefore for a balanced fermi gas @xmath0 is always lower than @xmath71 . on the contrary , in the case of unequal spin up  and",
    "spin down  populations , for a sufficiently high population imbalance the phase transition at @xmath75 can be of the first order , when the gap parameter @xmath59 changes discontinuously from zero to a finite value . in this case , as shown below , @xmath0 and @xmath71 can coincide in a definite range of the coupling strength .    in the region between @xmath0 and @xmath71 ,",
    "the superfluidity is destroyed owing to a proliferation of free vortices . however , the phase of a 2d fermi gas in this region is not a uniform normal state , because the gap parameter for @xmath85 can be other than zero , so that fermion pairing can occur in that temperature region .",
    "the region between @xmath0 and @xmath86 can be therefore attributed to a state in which pairing can occur but the phase coherence is destroyed . for slightly higher temperatures with respect to @xmath0 ,",
    "vortices form a disordered gas of phase defects @xcite . for higher temperatures",
    "the concept of vortices is inapplicable due to density fluctuations .    in general , there are the following regions in phase diagrams for an imbalanced fermi gas in 2d : ( 1 ) the normal state in which the gap parameter @xmath87 , ( 2 ) the superfluid quasicondensate state in which @xmath88 and @xmath84 , ( 3 ) the state in which pairing is possible but without phase coherence , and ( 4 ) the phase separation region , which appears due to a population imbalance . in the latter one , no solution exist for the set of equations ( [ min ] ) and ( [ number ] ) .",

    "when the system is imbalanced , two changes occur with respect to the balanced case : ( i ) below a certain value of the binding energy , @xmath100 , and ( ii ) a tricritical point appears on this curve .",
    "the mean - field phase transition curve splits below this tricritical point and the phase separation region opens up . in this tricritical point",
    ", there is coexistence of the paired state without phase coherence , the normal state , and the phase separation region .",
    "the area of the phase separation region is narrow and broadens with increasing the imbalance potential .",

    ", we retrieve the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and find that the bkt transition temperature is nonzero for any finite binding energy . in particular , we find that in the strong - coupling limit ( for large @xmath91 ) , the superfluid density @xmath77 rises to its maximum , equal to half the total fermion density , so that the bkt transition temperature obtained from eq .",
    "( [ tkt ] ) tends to a finite value @xmath102 .",
    "when imbalance is introduced , two qualitative changes occur in the bkt transition curve .",
    "firstly , below a critical value of the binding energy , @xmath103 .",
    "imbalance suppresses bkt - superfluidity as it does for 3d - superfluidity . the critical binding energy needed to restore superfluidity shifts to higher values as the imbalance potential grows .",
    "secondly , there appears a tricritical point also on the bkt curve , indicating coexistence of the superfluid state , the state with pairing but no phase coherence , and the phase separation region .",
    "the dotted curve in the region of the normal state separates two regimes : ( i ) the regime where the thermodynamic potential contains only one minimum at @xmath87 above the dotted curve , and ( ii ) the regime where the thermodynamic potential contains two minima : the lower minimum at @xmath87 and a higher one at a value @xmath88 .",
    "this second minimum suggests the existence of a metastable superfluid state .    in fig .",
    "2 , we choose to fix @xmath104 , the relative population imbalance itself , rather than the imbalance potential @xmath44 , and study the phase diagram in the variables @xmath105 .",
    "the inset shows a slice of this phase diagram at @xmath106 . at this binding energy ,",
    "the bkt transition temperature is a non - single - valued function of @xmath104 .",
    "this result is not unexpected , because a similar non - single - valued behavior of the critical temperature exists also for the superfluid phase transition in a 3d fermi gas @xcite . in the 3d case",
    "this can be related to the sarma mechanism@xcite : at nonzero temperatures , a balanced superfluid system coexists with an imbalanced gas of thermal excitations ",
    "these excitations carry some of the excess majority component of the imbalanced gas .",
    "the bkt phase transition for a fermi gas in 2d is suppressed at lower values of the population imbalance than the superfluid phase transition for a fermi gas in 3d .",
    "furthermore , this suppression is more strongly revealed at higher binding energies .",
    "the reason of such a dependence of the bkt phase transition as a function of the binding energy consists in the following .",
    "let us consider first a part of the phase diagram in the variables @xmath107 taking into attention only the mean - field phase transition .",
    "similar phase diagrams were calculated for a 3d fermi gas in ref .",
    ". an important feature of phase diagrams for both 3d and 2d imbalanced fermi gases is the fact that the phase separation region lies at lower temperatures with respect to the superfluid state .",
    "this means that , when the temperature is gradually lowered at a fixed imbalance @xmath104 ( which is assumed to be sufficiently low to pass the region of the superfluid state ) , we can observe the superfluid phase transition from the normal state to the superfluid state , and then , when the temperature is lowered further , the superfluid state becomes non - stable in the phase separation region .",
    "so , a sufficient lowering of the temperature leads to an instability of the superfluid state of an imbalanced fermi gas . on the one hand , with increasing the coupling strength ,",
    "the phase separation region broadens , and its upper - temperature boundary shifts to higher temperatures . on the other hand ,",
    "the bkt transition temperature does not unrestrictedly increase with an increasing coupling strength . as follows from the nelson - kosterlitz equation ( [ tkt ] )",
    ", the upper bound for @xmath0 is @xmath108 .",
    "this is the case when the superfluid pair density achieves its maximal possible value for a balanced gas @xmath109 . as a result , with an increasing coupling strength ,",
    "we arrive at a stronger overlap between the area of the superfluid quasicondensate state ( below @xmath0 ) and the phase separation region .",
    "it is natural to expect that at sufficiently high binding energy , the phase separation region can completely cover the area below @xmath0 , so that the superfluid state vanishes at all temperatures . in this connection ,",
    "the study of phase diagrams for a 2d fermi gas in the variables @xmath110 at a given relative population imbalance ( i. e. , slices of the above considered three - dimensional phase diagram at fixed @xmath111 ) represents a particular interest .    in fig .",
    "3 , we have plotted phase diagrams for a 2d fermi gas in the variables @xmath110 at the relative population imbalance @xmath112 and 0.1 .",
    "we see that even at a low population imbalance @xmath113 , the region where the superfluid state exists is relatively narrow . furthermore , with an increasing binding energy @xmath91 , the upper - temperature bound of the phase separation region rises faster than the bkt transition temperature . as a result",
    ", the range of coupling strengths at which the bkt superfluid phase transition can occur , is restricted both from lower and higher coupling . for the comparison ,",
    "the regular superfluid phase transition in a 3d imbalanced fermi gas is restricted only from lower couplings @xcite .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "3 ( _ b _ ) that for a higher ( but relatively low ) imbalance @xmath114 , the higher - temperature bound of the phase separation region lies higher than @xmath0 for all considered values of the binding energy @xmath91 . as a result , for @xmath114 the superfluid state is absent .",
    "the obtained behavior of phase diagrams for a 2d fermi gas confirms our suggestions above .",
    "in summary , we have described the effects of imbalance on the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless superfluid transition in a 2d fermi gas , through the functional integral formalism .",
    "owing to a population imbalance , the superfluid state can not exist for all values of the coupling strength , but only above a certain critical binding energy which depends on the imbalance .",
    "the larger the imbalance potential , the higher is this critical binding energy . as distinct from the balanced case ,",
    "there is a phase - separated region in phase diagrams , in which no uniform state can exist . as a result",
    ", tricritical points appear at the phase diagrams , in which three different regimes coexist .",
    "the area of the phase - separated region increases with increasing the population imbalance . due to the rise of the upper - temperature bound of the instability region , the area of the superfluid state at a fixed relative population imbalance decreases with increasing the binding energy .",
    "therefore a population imbalance is a factor destroying superfluidity in 2d systems , especially at high binding energies",
    ". the bkt transition can be experimentally observable for an imbalanced fermi gas through the phase separation in a quasi 2d trap . as follows from the obtained results ,",
    "the parameters of the state of that system ( e. g. , critical temperatures and/or density profiles ) are expected to be substantially more sensitive to the population imbalance than the corresponding parameters for a 3d gas .",

    "<S> the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) mechanism describes the breakdown of superfluidity in a two - dimensional bose gas or a two - dimensional gas of paired fermions . in the latter case , a population imbalance between the two pairing partners in the fermi mixture is known to influence pairing characteristics . here </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the effects of imbalance on the two - dimensional bkt superfluid transition , and show that superfluidity is even more sensitive to imbalance than for three dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> finite - temperature phase diagrams are derived using the functional integral formalism in combination with a hydrodynamic action functional for the phase fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this allow to identify a phase separation region and tricritical points due to imbalance . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to superfluidity in the three - dimensional case , the effect of imbalance is also pronounced in the strong - coupling regime . </S>"
