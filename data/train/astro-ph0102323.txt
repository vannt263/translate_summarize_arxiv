    "the study of the early universe has received a considerable boost in the past few years , due to the development of new techniques for finding large numbers of galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. u and b band dropouts , steidel et al .",
    "although radio galaxies are no longer the only class of well studied high redshift galaxies , they remain of exceptional cosmological interest , since they are likely to be amongst the most massive galaxies known in the early universe and may be the progenitors of brightest cluster galaxies observed at low redshift .",
    "+ their large masses can be inferred from their k  band luminosities and the near - ir k - z hubble diagram ( e.g. van breugel et al .",
    "furthermore there is evidence that they are undergoing vigorous star formation : at least in some high redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) the uv continuum is dominated by young stars , with estimated star - formation ( sf ) rates of up to 1000 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 ( dey et al .",
    "sub - millimeter continuum dust emission has been detected in several of the highest redshift galaxies ( e.g. papadopoulos et al .",
    "2000 ) , also implying similar large sf rates .",
    "these stars are expected to settle on dynamical time - scales and evolve into fully developed elliptical galaxies .",
    "+ evidence that hzrgs might be located in proto- cluster environments includes : ( i ) the recent discovery of a megaparsec - scale structure of more than 15 ly@xmath3 emitting galaxies around the radio galaxy mrc 1138@xmath4262 at z@xmath5 ( pentericci et al .",
    "2000a ) ; around this same radio galaxy , the detection of luminous x - ray emission which is probably extended and has been attributed to a hot cluster atmosphere ( carilli et al .",
    "1998 ) ; ( ii ) large faraday rotation of the polarized radio emission indicating that some hzrgs are surrounded by dense hot magnetized cluster gas ( carilli et al .  1997 ; pentericci et al .",
    "2000b ) ; ( iii ) excess of companion galaxies detected along the axes or in the vicinity of the radio sources ( rttgering et al .",
    "1996 ) ; ( iv ) possible excess of lyman break selected galaxies in the fields of several other powerful radio sources ( e.g. lacy & rawlings 1996 ) and in particular several candidate companion galaxies ( with two objects spectroscopically confirmed ) in the vicinity of mrc 0316@xmath4257 , at z@xmath6 ( le fevre et al .  1996 ;",
    "mccarthy et al .  1992 ) , and a number of faint red companions of 4c 41.17 at z@xmath7 detected from deep keck imaging at 2 @xmath8 m ( graham et al .  1994 ) .",
    "+ having both large stellar masses ( e.g. 4c41.17 with m@xmath9 , van breugel et al .",
    "1998 ) and high star formation rates ( see above ) , and being located in the densest regions of the early universe , it is natural to propose that hzrgs will evolve into present - day brightest clusters galaxies ( e.g. best et al .",
    "+   + in previous papers we have described our studies of hzrgs with the hubble space telescope at optical ( uv rest - frame ) wavelengths ( pentericci et al .",
    "1998 and 1999 ) .",
    "it was found that several hzrgs , such as mrc 1138@xmath4262 at z@xmath10 and 4c41.17 at z@xmath7 ( dey et al .",
    "1997 ) are comprised of numerous continuum clumps embedded in giant ( @xmath0 100 kpc ) diffuse ly@xmath3 halos .",
    "such morphologies are strikingly similar to simulations of forming bright cluster galaxies , made on the basis of the hierarchical models , which predict that the most massive systems are assembled from smaller building blocks ( e.g. baron and white 1987 ; dubinski 1998 ) . indeed the sizes , profiles and luminosities of the _ individual _ clumps are similar to those of the lyman break galaxies ( lbg ) ( e.g. steidel et al .",
    "1996 , giavalisco et al .",
    "1996 ) , indicating that hzrgs could be formed by an assembly of lbgs ( pentericci et al .",
    "+ the well known alignment observed between the rest - frame uv morphology and the radio axis ( chambers et al .",
    "1987 , mccarthy et al .",
    "1987 ) implies that the uv emission is strongly effected by the active galactic nucleus , e.g. by scattered light from a qso or a young population of stars whose formation is triggered by the passage of the radio jet .",
    "studies of the near - infrared morphology ( rest - frame optical ) are particularly important to reveal the nature of the older stellar population ( e.g. lilly 1988 ) , although observations of the continuum emission are made difficult by the presence of strong emission lines in the near - ir bands ( eales & rawlings 1993 ) .",
    "+ there have been extensive ground  based near - ir studies of powerful radio galaxies at intermediate and high redshift ( e.g. eisenhardt and chokshi 1990 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "1992 ; eales et al .  1997 ; best et al .  1998 ;",
    "van breugel et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the most important results of these searches are : ( i ) the morphologies of z @xmath0 1 galaxies in the near - ir emission are considerably more relaxed and symmetric than in the optical emission ; surface photometry of 3cr z @xmath0 1 galaxies has shown that they follow a de vaucouleurs law ( best et al .",
    "1998 ) , implying that they are dynamically evolved systems ( e.g. rigler and lilly 1994 ) with inferred stellar masses of up to 10@xmath11 ; ( ii ) 3cr radio galaxies show a possible excess of emission at large radii , resembling the halo that surrounds nearby cd galaxies ( best et al .  1998 ) ; ( iii ) models of spectral energy distributions of radio galaxies having redshifts between 1 and 3 have been used to infer the ages of their stellar populations , suggesting ages in excess of 1 gyr and formation redshift of z@xmath05 or higher ( e.g. mccarthy 1993b , lilly 1988 ) ; ( iv ) deep near infrared ( k - band ) imaging reveal clustering of red galaxies around some z@xmath12 3cr galaxies ( e.g. roche et al .",

    "1998 ) found strong evolution of the morphology of hzrgs at rest frame visual ( @xmath13  ) wavelengths , from aligned galaxies at redshift @xmath14 to more symmetrical and compact galaxies at z@xmath15 .",
    "+ with nicmos it is possible to study the near infrared morphology of hzrgs to a resolution comparable to that of our optical wfpc2 images , allowing us to investigate the morphologies of their evolved stellar populations at redshift larger than 2 .",
    "we can then address questions such as whether there are already well formed ellipticals at those epochs ; the importance and the frequencies of merging with sub - galactic clumps at different epochs ; how the presence of substructures evolves with redshift ; the relationship between the radio source and the near infrared emission in the central regions of the galaxies .",
    "in particular , one can examine to what extent the optical / uv alignment effect is also present at near infrared wavelengths .",
    "+ in this paper we present nicmos observations of a sample of 19 radio galaxies with 1.8 @xmath16 3.2 . in section 2",
    "we describe the sample selection and the observations .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the presentation of the results , and a description of the morphologies of the individual objects . in section 4",
    "we analyze the morphologies of the galaxies and their optical - to - infrared colors ; we then discuss the implication of our nicmos results for the study of the alignment effect and we investigate the statistics of ( aligned ) companion galaxies around the targets .",
    "two sub - samples of objects were observed .",
    "the first sub - sample consists of 14 radio galaxies from the molonglo reference catalog ( mrc ) ( mccarthy et al .",
    "the mrc/1jy sample was defined simply using a flux density limit at 408 mhz of s@xmath17 0.95 jy , within a restricted region of the sky ( @xmath18 dec@xmath19 , @xmath20 ) ; @xmath21% of the sources in the catalog have been optically identified , and 46 of the 426 radio galaxies in the sample have spectroscopically confirmed redshift @xmath22 ( see mccarthy et al .",

    "1992 for infrared observations ) .",
    "+ we then added 5 targets selected from a sample of ultra steep spectrum radio galaxies ( uss ) .",
    "this sample comprises the largest set of radio galaxies having redshift larger than 2 , which were selected on the basis of the radio spectral indices ( @xmath23 where @xmath24 ) .",
    "this selection technique has proven to be the most effective tool for identifying such radio galaxies .",
    "several samples of uss sources ( e.g. chambers et al .",
    "1996 , rttgering et al .",
    "1994 ) have led to the discovery of more than 80 radio galaxies with z@xmath25 2 , about 60@xmath26 of the 150 such sources known to date ( e.g. van breugel et al . 1999 ) .",
    "all the highest redshift radio galaxies ( z @xmath27 3.5 ) have been found using this technique ( e.g.  van breugel et al .",
    "the uss sample covers a larger area in the sky than the mrc sample , and allows us to probe a wider range of radio sources parameters such as their luminosity and size .",
    "furthermore selecting sources from the uss sample will give a larger overlap with the existing data base of wfpc2 images ( pentericci et al .",
    "+ the final sample consists of 19 radio galaxies , uniformly spanning a redshift range between z @xmath28 1.68 and z @xmath28 3.13 , and having a large range of properties , e.g. a range of nearly 3 magnitudes in the infrared luminosity and a factor of 8 in radio power .",
    "the radio galaxies are listed in table [ tbl-1 ] : for each object we report the redshift , the position of the radio core , the total flux at 4.7 ghz , the spectral index between 4.7 and 8.2 ghz , @xmath29 , the total size in arcseconds and an indication of the radio morphology .        in table",
    "[ tbl-2 ] we list the radio galaxies observed and various observational parameters .",

    "the filter used was the f160w filter , which is centered at 1.6 @xmath8 m , has a bandwidth of 0.4@xmath8 m and has the minimum background amongst the available nicmos filters ; we also used the f165 m filter which is centered at 1.7@xmath8 m and has a bandwidth of 0.2@xmath8 m .",
    "we had initially selected this second filter for many of the objects , because it would have provided a bandpass free from line emission for most of the galaxies in the sample , in particular those in the lowest and in the highest redshift ranges ( z@xmath33 2.09 and z @xmath272.6 ) . unfortunately using this filter",
    "the response was limited by readout - noise and dark current and we had to change our initial observing strategy to use the f160w filter .",
    "the wider filter bandwidth included bright emission lines for many of the sources ( see table [ tbl-2 ] ) , but we estimate that in most cases this causes relatively little confusion in determining their real continuum morphologies ( however see next section ) .",
    "the high sensitivity of this filter allowed the galaxies to be mapped within the allocated 2 to 5 orbits per object .",
    "+ each orbit included two 1026 seconds exposures using the mif1024 multiaccum exposure sequence and one shorter exposure using the step64 sampling sequence .",
    "the exposure times for the step64 samples were 384 , 411 , 512 or 576 seconds depending on the orbit .",
    "the total integration time for each galaxy is given in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "to facilitate removal of residual flat field and imperfection of the detector , the targets were offset by @xmath34 between each exposure , giving a grid of 15 , 12 , 9 or 6 exposures .",
    "+ the nicmos imaging data were processed in the following manner : the zero level determined from the first read of each exposure sequence was subtracted from all other exposures ; then a scaled version of the best dark exposure provided by the hst archive was subtracted .",
    "the resulting sequences of `` read '' in each multiaccum or step64 series were then used to produce a masked , linearized and , to first order , cosmic ray rejected image using an algorithm written by mcleod ( 1997 ) .",
    "then for the exposures which were obtained before august 1997 the pedestal level ( i.e. significant fluctuations of the zero level between sequences ) was subtracted separately from each quadrant of the hgcdte detector and again the cosmic ray rejection algorithm was used .",
    "for the observations taken after august 1997 the last two steps could be skipped . finally , the images were flat fielded using the best flat field provided from the hst archive .",
    "the images were then registered using fractional pixel shifts , and were combined using a mask for removal of bad pixels and hot pixels ( this mask was constructed directly using the observation frames ) and a multi pass @xmath35 cosmic ray rejection algorithm . in combining the images , we weighted them using their exposure times .      for 3 radio galaxies in the sample ( mrc 0156@xmath4252 , mrc 0406@xmath4244 and mrc 2104@xmath4242 ) we gathered extensive ground - based optical and near - ir data during the last few years . in table [ tbl-3 ] we summarize the relevant observations . some results on mrc 0406@xmath4244",

    "+ for the spectroscopic observations at the eso / ntt telescope , the detector was a tektronix ccd with @xmath36 pixels and a scale along the slit of 0.37@xmath32 per pixels .",
    "the ccd was binned by a factor of two in the wavelength direction . using a 2.5@xmath32 wide slit with eso grating @xmath37 we achieved a spectral resolution of 2.8 @xmath38 ( full width at half maximum , fwhm ) .",
    "the raw spectra were bias subtracted and flat fielded ; the sky contribution was then removed by subtracting a sky - spectrum obtained avoiding the regions where the target was positioned ; finally wavelength calibration was performed by measuring the position on the ccd of known lines from a he - ar calibration lamp , fitting a polynomial function to these data and applying the resultant calibration factors .",
    "the accuracy of the calibration is better than 0.3  .",
    "+ the j and k images were obtained with the las campanas du pont 2.5 m telescope and its @xmath39 hgcdte array camera , which has a pixel scale of 0.35@xmath32 .",
    "the integration times ranged from 4000 to 9000 seconds and the objects were moved on the array every 150 seconds .",
    "the data were calibrated with standard stars from elias et al .",
    "the reduction followed standard techniques .",
    "the @xmath40 , i and ly@xmath3 images were also obtained at las campanas using a @xmath41 texas instruments ccd detector : the exposures were binned 2@xmath422 resulting in a pixel scale of 0.332@xmath32 .",
    "the ly@xmath3 images were obtained with interference filters having 1% band - widths .",
    "several 1800 second exposures of each field were obtained , with approximately @xmath43 offsets between each image . + all data were reduced using standard iraf procedures .",

    "all the radio galaxies with the exceptions listed below were imaged with the vla in a - array as part of a high resolution , multi - frequency radio polarimetric study carried out on a large sample of hzrgs ; for further details about the observations see carilli et al .",
    "for a subset of galaxies , new vla observations were carried out : the radio galaxies mrc 0324@xmath4228 and mrc 0350@xmath4279 were observed in the b - array configuration at 4.85 ghz ( c - band ) .",
    "the radio galaxies mrc 0152@xmath4209 , mrc 1017@xmath4220 , mrc 2048@xmath4272 and mrc 2224@xmath4273 were observed in the a - array configuration as part of a new high resolution multi - frequency radio survey .",
    "details of these observations have been be presented elsewhere ( pentericci et al .",
    "2000b ) .",
    "as explained earlier we observed most of our targets with the f160w broad band filter .",
    "this resulted in the unavoidable inclusion of bright emission lines normally found in radio galaxies .",
    "for the lowest redshift object ( mrc 2224@xmath4273 at z @xmath28 1.68 ) , the strong emission line h@xmath3 falls in the observed wavelength range ; for the objects in the redshift range 1.9@xmath442.6 , [ oiii ] and h@xmath45 become important ; finally for the higher redshift objects ( z @xmath46 ) the emission line [ oii ] is within the observed wavelength range .",
    "in table [ tbl-2 ] we have listed , for each object , the lines that can contribute substantially to the continuum band flux and the total estimated contribution to the continuum flux .",
    "+ since we do not have direct measurements for the line fluxes and their equivalent widths , we have estimated the total contaminating flux using other measured lines ( in most cases ly@xmath3 and/or h@xmath3 ) .",
    "we have used the emission line ratio reported by mccarthy ( 1993 ) and eales & rawlings ( 1996 ) , i.e. ly@xmath3/[oii]@xmath47 , [ oiii]/[oii]@xmath48 , ly@xmath3/h@xmath3 @xmath49 .",
    "note however that these are only average ratios .",
    "for example , eales & rawlings ( 1993 ) find that the line emission ratios can vary significantly ( within a factor of 10 ) from object to object , due to the different physical conditions of the gas and/or the presence of dust which can attenuate the ly@xmath3 line ( e.g. in uss 0211@xmath4122 , van ojik et al .",
    "another important source of uncertainty is the difference in the apertures used to derive the continuum and line fluxes : the continuum flux was measured through a fixed 4@xmath32 diameter aperture , while the line fluxes ( mostly taken from the literature ) were measured within different apertures and with slits of different sizes .",
    "when the apertures used to determine the emission line flux were known ( in about half of the cases ) we corrected for this by simply scaling the line flux to an aperture of 4@xmath32 .",
    "therefore the values for the emission line contamination given in table [ tbl-2 ] are only indicative .",
    "most important , the line contribution may vary spatially and some parts of the galaxies might be more effected than others , with a much higher line contribution than that listed in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the coordinate frame for the nicmos images determined from the image header information has uncertainties of the order of @xmath50 due to the uncertainty in the position of the guide star ( hst data handbook ) .",
    "since the optical galaxies are generally clumpy on a scale of a few tenths of arcsecond , it is important to obtain the better relative registration between the radio and the optical images for a detailed inter - comparison .",
    "+ our radio maps have a typical resolution of 0.2@xmath32 which is comparable to that of the nicmos images .",
    "the exceptions are the radio maps of mrc 0324@xmath4228 and mrc 0350@xmath4279 which have a resolution of 1.2@xmath32 .",
    "+ to align the nicmos and the radio vla images we overlayed the radio cores ( for the identification of radio cores see carilli et al .  1997 and pentericci et al .",
    "2000 ) on the peak position of the near infrared emission , on the assumption that this ir peak coincides with the galaxy nucleus . in these cases",
    "the estimated uncertainty in the overlay is @xmath51 . in the cases of mrc 0324@xmath4218 , mrc 0943@xmath4242 , uss 1707@xmath52105 and",
    "mrc 2048@xmath4272 where no radio core was detected , we used the absolute hst and vla astrometry to align the maps ; in these cases the accuracy achieved is only @xmath53 .",
    "in figures 1 to 19 we present the images of the radio galaxies . in most cases",
    "we show grey scale representations of the nicmos emission with vla contours superimposed ( unless the radio emission is unresolved ) and a contour map of the continuum emission to better delineate the morphology of the central regions ( for all sources except the three unresolved ones ) .",

    "these characteristics argue against scattering as a major contributor to the light , since in this case we would expect components with uniform and bluer colors ( assuming that the properties of the scattering medium do not vary considerably amongst the various components ) .",
    "hence we conclude that in these systems the contribution of scattered light to the optical continuum must be very small ( less than 10% ) .",
    "+ if we then assume that in these galaxies most of the emission is produced stellar light , we can derive an approximate age for the stellar population and compare it with the age of the radio sources , to determine whether jet - induced star formation could be a viable mechanism to account for the stellar population.to derive an _ indicative _ age for the stars , we have matched the amplitude of the 4000 break observed in the clumps with the amplitudes ( at the same rest - frame wavelengths ) derived from the spectral energy distributions of stellar populations evolving according to the galaxy isochrone synthesis spectral evolution library compiled by bruzual and charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "we used their 1995 model , assuming a simple stellar population , and a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , with star masses ranging from 0.1 to 125 @xmath102 .",
    "the instantaneous star - burst model , which evolves most rapidly , can reproduce the observed 4000 break in 0.5 gyrs for the bluest components of hzrgs , to 1.3 gyr for the reddest ones .",
    "all other modes of star formation ( e.g. star - burst with a finite duration , an exponentially declining star formation mode , etc . )",
    "require a longer time to reproduce the same colors .",
    "+ clearly there are a number of uncertainties in this age determination , e.g. the inferred ages could be wrongly estimated in those components that have a contribution of line emission in any of the two bands . in any case",
    "the indication is that these components have rather large ages , of the order of half a gyr or more .",
    "+ the typical life - time of a radio source can be easily derived as t@xmath28d/2v , where v is the expansion speed of the hot - spots and d is the total extent of a radio source .",
    "the velocity v is typically in the range 0.01 - 0.2c ( e.g.  alexander and leahy 1987 ) , and our sources have maximum extent of about 200 kpc .",
    "therefore their lifetime will be in the range 0.2 - 3 @xmath103 yrs , i.e. about 100 times shorter than that of the stellar population .",
    "note that alternative estimates of the radio source life - time , e.g. from spectral ageing arguments also in general lead to ages of @xmath104 yrs ( carilli et al .",
    "clearly if the radio activity was recurrent then the observed clumps could have formed during previous phases of activity .",
    "+ finally we mention the model proposed by west ( 1994 ) , in which the anisotropy of the optical and infrared emission around a typical high redshift radio galaxy is due to the anisotropy of the surrounding density distribution ( see also eales 1992 ) . in this model ,",
    "galaxy formation proceeds along preferred directions which are related to large scale elongated distribution of matter : in the prolate potential of the forming galaxy , the gas will fall and settle into a disk whose axis is along the major axis of the distribution of matter . the radio jets then will be emitted along this axis , hence the alignment between their direction and the distribution of the surrounding material ( gas and stars ) . within this model",
    "the relative ages of the radio jets and stellar components do not have to be matched .",
    "however , this model alone can not explain the alignment effect since , for example , it can not explain the polarization properties of many hzrgs .",
    "most hzrgs in our sample show very close companion objects .",
    "we define a companion as a small ( size @xmath105 ) object that is located within a region delineated by a 100 kpc diameter around the radio source .",
    "we exclude objects with a stellar profile ( although they might be in some cases high redshift unresolved objects , rather than stars ) and those which can be recognized as spirals , on the assumption that they are most probably foreground systems .",
    "we do not consider the inner 30 kpc from the galaxy centers , to ensure that the regions of the source itself are excluded from the statistics ( this is true in almost all cases except for the larger systems , but the overall result does not depend on them ) .",
    "+ the average number of companion galaxies for the 19 hzrgs is 1.9@xmath840.3 down to a magnitude limit of @xmath106 . from deep counts of nicmos parallel orbit , yan et al .  ( 1998 ) derive an average cumulative density of galaxies in h - band down to a magnitude @xmath106 of @xmath107 galaxies deg@xmath108 .",
    "the expected number of galaxies in a circular area of radius 50 kpc is 1.4 .",
    "therefore there is a marginal ( 2@xmath88 ) excess of objects in the area around hzrgs .",
    "+ we do not have any other systematic information on these possible companion galaxies , that might tell us about their real redshifts .",
    "however further evidence that these objects may be associated to the radio galaxies is provided by the distribution of the orientation of companions with respect to the radio axis ( or optical axis if the radio source is unresolved ) . in computing this distribution",
    "we have excluded companions of the 2 radio galaxies that are unresolved both in the radio and in the near - infrared emission ( mrc 0324@xmath4228 and mrc 1017@xmath4220 ) since in these cases it is impossible to determine any preferred direction .",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "32 : the histogram shows that the companion galaxies are predominantly located along the radio axis .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the distribution differs from a uniform distribution between 0@xmath61 and 90@xmath61 with 99% probability . + rttgering et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reported a similar effect , finding a statistical excess of optical companions located along the radio axis of uss radio sources . while they defined companions as objects that are located within a circle with diameter equal to the radio source extension , we prefer to use a fixed scale , since we do not assume a - priori that the companion galaxies are related to the presence of the radio sources",
    ". however it is significant that , even with a different definition , both groups find an excess density in the direction of the radio axis . +",
    "this result shows that the alignment effect not only holds for the radio galaxy hosts , but also for its neighboring galaxies within an area of at least @xmath109 kpc .",
    "an interesting issue would be also to determine how the overdensity and the alignment of these companion galaxies depend on the area considered .",
    "unfortunately the nicmos data are not useful in this respect , since the nic 2 field of view is far too small .",
    "+ the above conclusions show that any model attempting to explain the alignment effect has to take into account not only the morphology of the radio galaxies hosts , but also their surroundings ( for the possible origin of the alignment effect see the discussion and the references in the previous section ) .",
    "we have presented the results of a near infrared imaging program on a sample of 19 radio galaxies having redshift between 1.7 and 3.2 , observed with nicmos camera 2 on the hubble space telescope .",
    "+ our observations show that the host galaxies of powerful radio sources have a wide range of morphologies , from systems with simple compact morphologies to systems with substructures such as multiple emission peaks to systems comprised of several components spread over large areas . only in few cases",
    "the active nucleus dominates the emission in the central region .",
    "+ following is a summary of the most important results obtained : + ( i ) while most systems appear irregular , 5 galaxies at z @xmath0 2 have morphologies consistent with them being elliptical galaxies ( or bulges ) , i.e. they can be well represented by the classical r@xmath80 law .",
    "a comparison between this small sample and the host galaxies of z @xmath83 3cr radio sources , observed at similar rest - frame wavelengths and resolution , indicates that there is difference of a factor 2 in their effective radii .",
    "+ ( ii ) we find that in almost all extended systems the near infrared continuum light is aligned with the radio axis and the aligned component has very red colors . for several galaxies wfpc2 v or r - band images were available so we computed a high resolution map of the optical - to - infrared spectral index .",
    "these spectral indices are in general rather steep , @xmath110 or steeper .",
    "the clumpy systems show net color differences between the various components , which can be explained with different ages for the stellar content .",
    "indicative ages determined from the bruzual and charlot models are of the order of @xmath00.5 - 1 gyr in most cases , much larger than typical radio source ages .",
    "+ ( iii ) in the small nicmos frames we can see in many cases nearby faint objects around the high redshift radio galaxies , and their space density is slightly higher than what is observed in the deep nicmos parallel observations of random fields .",
    "furthermore these objects tend to be aligned with the direction of the main axis of the radio sources suggesting that they are related to the presence of the radio galaxies .",

    "<S> we present the results of a near infrared imaging program of a sample of 19 radio galaxies with redshift between 1.7 and 3.2 , using the nicmos camera 2 on the hubble space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies were observed in h - band which , for 18 of the 19 targets , samples the rest - frame optical emission longwards of the 4000 break . for many sources </S>",
    "<S> this band contains emission lines , but we estimated that this causes relatively little confusion in most cases . </S>",
    "<S> + the high angular resolution of the hst allows a detailed study of the host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the images show a wide range of morphologies , including ( i ) compact systems , ( ii ) systems with substructures such as multiple emission peaks and ( iii ) systems comprised of several components spread over areas of up to 100 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> three galaxies appear unresolved and in two others a nuclear point source dominates the emission in the central region . </S>",
    "<S> + the morphologies of some of the lowest redshift targets are well represented by de vaucouleurs profiles , consistent with them being elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> their average effective radius derived is a factor of 2 smaller than that of z @xmath0 1 3cr radio galaxies at similar restframe wavelength . + </S>",
    "<S> the near infrared continuum light is generally well aligned with the radio axis and the aligned light is very red , with typical v - h colors of @xmath0 3.54 . for several galaxies where wfpc2 v or r - band images were available we computed a high resolution map of the optical - to - infrared spectral indices : all multi - component systems present net color differences between the various clumps , and we argue that most probably the continuum emission has a stellar origin . </S>",
    "<S> indicative ages of these stellar populations , as determined by the amplitude of the 4000 break vary between 0.5 and 1.3 gyrs . + finally in many of the small nicmos frames we observe nearby faint objects close to the high redshift radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the number density of these faint objects is slightly higher than that observed in the deep nicmos parallel observations of random fields : furthermore these objects tend to be aligned with the direction of the main axis of the radio sources , suggesting that they may be related to the presence of the agn . </S>"
