    "studies of the hadronic interaction of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons is of a great importance especially regarding the unknown nature of the @xmath5(980 ) and @xmath6(980 ) scalar resonances , which besides the standard interpretation as a quark - antiquark state  @xcite were also proposed to be a @xmath7 molecules  @xcite .",
    "+ due to lack of the kaonic targets we investigate experimentally the strength of the @xmath1 interaction for example in the near threshold @xmath0 reaction where kaons are produced with low relative momenta  @xcite .",
    "+ measurements of the @xmath0 reaction at the kinematical threshold have been made possible by beams of low emittance and small momentum spread available at storage ring facilities , in particular at the cooler synchrotron cosy at the research center in jlich , germany  @xcite .",
    "early experiments at cosy conducted by means of the cosy-11 detector  @xcite revealed , however , that a possible influence from the @xmath6 or @xmath5 mesons on the @xmath8 pair production is too weak to be distinguished from the direct production of these mesons  @xcite .",
    "however , the combined systematic collection of data below  @xcite and above  @xcite the @xmath9 meson threshold reveal a significant signal in the shape of the excitation function which may be due to the @xmath10 and perhaps also to the @xmath8 interaction .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath2 reaction were conducted at low excess energies by the collaborations anke  @xcite , cosy-11  @xcite and disto  @xcite , and revealed a significant discrepancy between obtained excitation function and theoretical expectations neglecting interaction of kaons in the final state .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath12fsi , based on factorization ansatz introduced by the anke collaboration , reproduces the experimental data for excess energies down to q  =  28  mev , but underestimates the data very close to threshold  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that in this energy region the influence of the @xmath8 interaction may be significant .",
    "therefore , we have performed a more detailed analysis of the cosy-11 data at excess energies of q  =  10  mev and 28  mev including studies of the differential cross section distributions  @xcite .",
    "based on the mentioned factorization ansatz with additional term describing interaction in the @xmath1 system we compared the experimental event distributions to the results of monte carlo simulations treating the @xmath1 scattering length as an unknown parameter , which has to be determined .",
    "finally , based for the first time on the low energy @xmath8 invariant mass distributions and the generalized dalitz plot analysis , we have estimated the @xmath1 scattering length  @xcite .",
    "+ due to the low statistics the uncertainties of the determined scattering length are rather large , therefore we decided to combine goldhaber plot analysis of cosy-11 data with fitting to the experimental excitation function near threshold .",
    "we have constructed the @xmath13 statistic : @xmath14 + \\sum_j\\frac{\\left(\\sigma_{j}^{exp } - \\alpha\\sigma_{j}^{mod}\\right)^2}{\\left(\\delta\\sigma_{j}^{exp}\\right)^2}~ , \\label{eqchi2_mh}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 denotes the number of events in the @xmath16th bin of the experimental goldhaber plot , @xmath17 stands for the content of the same bin in the simulated distributions , @xmath18 denotes the @xmath19th calculated total cross section , @xmath20 is the @xmath19th experimental total cross section measured with uncertainty @xmath21 , and @xmath22 stands for the normalization factor .    -  @xmath23 distribution as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath23 denotes the absolute minimum with respect to parameters @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ]  -  @xmath23 distribution as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath23 denotes the absolute minimum with respect to parameters @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ]  -  @xmath23 distribution as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath23 denotes the absolute minimum with respect to parameters @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ]    the obtained preliminary @xmath27 distributions ( suppressed by its minimum value ) as a function of the real and imaginary part of the @xmath1 scattering length are presented in fig .",
    "[ chi2_1 ] .",
    "the best fit to the experimental data corresponds to @xmath28  fm and @xmath29  fm .",
    "this preliminary result is by a factor of five more precise than the previous one based only on the analysis of the differential cross section distributions  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath2 reaction measured by cosy-11 collaboration at excess energy q = 10 mev and q = 28 mev has been extended to the determination of the differential cross sections in view of the @xmath8 final state interaction . to reduce the uncertainties on the @xmath1 scattering length we have performed combined analysis of both total and differential cross section distributions for the @xmath2 reaction .",
    "the preliminary result of the analysis is by a factor of five more precise , however the determined scattering length is still consistent with zero within one standard deviation .",
