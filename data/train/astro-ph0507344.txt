    "the vela supernova remnant ( snr ) is a middle - aged snr that exploded about 10000 years ago ( taylor et al .",
    "it clearly shows a circular structure with a diameter of 8@xmath3.3 ( aschenbach et al .",
    "1995 ) . at a distance of 250 @xmath4 30 pc ( cha et al .",
    "1999 ) , this corresponds to 36 pc .",
    "the vela snr is so close to us that it can be an ideal candidate for resolving fine structure in x - rays .",
    "aschenbach et al .",
    "( 1995 ) also discovered ` shrapnels ' , boomerang structures from ` a ' to ` f ' , outside the main shell .",
    "the opening angles of the shrapnels suggest supersonic motion in tenuous matter . the center line of each boomerang structure can be traced back to the center of the snr , which is close to the vela pulsar .",
    "therefore , they are considered to originate from fragments of supernova ( sn ) ejecta that are beyond the position of the main blast wave .",
    "there is an alternative explanation that the features are  break - outs \" of shock in which inhomogeneities in the ambient medium cause the shock to be non - spherical .",
    "vela shrapnel a was observed with asca ( tsunemi et al .",
    "it was clarified that the abundance of si is about 10-times higher than that of o. therefore , they concluded that shrapnel a was an explosion ejecta from a si - rich layer of a progenitor star . if it is ejecta of a sn explosion , the interstellar matter would be swept up in the leading edge while the ejecta material would be peeled off in the trailing edge .",
    "however , the spatial distribution of si could not be measured due to the poor spatial - resolving power of asca . in order to investigate the spatial structure of shrapnel a , miyata et al .",
    "( 2001 ) observed it with the chandra x - ray observatory .",
    "the chandra image reveals a bright x - ray region at the head position of shrapnel a and a fainter extended tail .",
    "they confirmed an overabundance of si in the head region , but could not obtain a strong constraint on the parameters of the tail region .",
    "shrapnel d , the eastern limb of the vela snr , is the closest to the main shell and the brightest in x - rays of the six shrapnels .",
    "the optical nebula rcw 37 ( rodgers et al",
    ".  1960 ) lies along the outer edge of shrapnel d , which clearly shows that shrapnel d is now interacting with an interstellar cloud .",
    "sankrit et al .  ( 2003 ) observed this optical filament and found that shrapnel d is a bow shock propagating into an interstellar cloud with normal abundances . in order to understand the nature of shrapnel d , plucinsky et al .",
    "( 2002 ) observed it two times with chandra , one at the head of shrapnel and the other in the trailing `` wake '' .",
    "if the x - ray emission associated with the shrapnel d is produced by shock - heating of the ambient medium by supersonic motion of the ejecta , one would expect the abundances to be enhanced at the head region and close to the interstellar medium ( ism ) value at the wake region .",
    "they found that the spectra from the different locations in the shrapnel are remarkably similar to each other .",
    "they did not show the abundance variations that might be expected from a fragment of ejecta .",
    "however , they could not obtain strong constraints on the elemental abundances : the o and ne abundances vary from 0.5 to 5.0 @xmath5 solar and 1.6 to 6.4 @xmath5 solar , respectively .",
    "they therefore concluded that the origin of shrapnel d is more consistent with a shock breakout hypothesis than with an ejecta hypothesis , although they can not rule out the ejecta hypothesis .",
    "what is indeed the origin of shrapnel d ?",
    "if it is a shrapnel of ejecta , how is the distribution of the element abundances in it ? in order to answer these questions , we observed shrapnel d with the xmm - newton satellite .",
    "we here present the results from the observation .",
    "then , we performed a spatially resolved spectral analysis , and showed the results of an in - situ observation of interaction zones between shrapnel d and the interstellar cloud .",
    "we observed shrapnel d on 2002 may 2 with the epic ( european photon imaging camera ) instruments on board the xmm - newton satellite .",
    "the observation i d is 0136010101 ( pi h. tsunemi ) . since the shrapnel is larger than the field of view ( fov ) of the epic ( @xmath6 ) , we selected the brightest region in the shrapnel .",
    "figure [ fov ] shows a rosat pspc image of shrapnel d with an overlay of the fov of our observation .",
    "the epic mos cameras were operated in the standard full - frame mode and the epic pn camera in the extended full - frame mode .",
    "each camera was operated using a medium filter . since we screened the data by rejecting the high - background periods , the effective exposure time",
    "was reduced to @xmath7 21 ks for mos-1 and mos-2 and to @xmath7 14 ks for pn .",
    "we selected x - ray events corresponding to patterns 012 for mos and patterns 04 for pn , respectively .",
    "since shrapnel d is larger than the fov , we could not subtract the background events from the same data .",
    "therefore , we used an observation ( i d 0147511701 ) of the lockman hole as background data .",
    "figure [ xim_opt ] shows an exposure - corrected mos-1@xmath8mos-2 image of shrapnel d in the energy range of 0.32kev with an overlaid optical contour map .",
    "we extracted the exposure map using sas v5.4.1(the eexpmap command ) , and smoothed the image by a gaussian of @xmath9 = @xmath10 .",
    "we found a bright x - ray ridge structure running from north to south in the region east of the fov .",
    "the x - ray emission from the eastern part of the ridge abruptly weakens to the background level , while that from the western part of the x - ray ridge gradually weakens .",
    "there is also an optical bright ridge structure , a pencil nebula rcw 37 , running parallel to the x - ray ridge at about @xmath11 in the east .",
    "this suggests that shrapnel d is now interacting with an interstellar cloud ( sankrit et al .",
    "we investigated spectral variations from various regions in detail . according to the x - ray ridge structure",
    ", we divided our fov into many small rectangles ( @xmath12 , a side with @xmath13 is perpendicular to the ridge and that of @xmath14 is parallel to that ) .",
    "the scale of the rectangle is larger than the half - power beam width of xmm - newton .",
    "the scale was selected such that we could obtain sufficient photon statistics in each rectangle . for the purpose of more detailed investigations , we arranged rectangles such that each rectangle overlapped each other by half of its size , obtaining 243 spectra in total .",
    "figure [ region ] shows those regions overlaid on a mos-1@xmath8mos-2 image that is the same as figure [ xim_opt ] . in the spectral analysis",
    ", we included the uncertainties among ccds by 5% on the model in quadrature ( see , e.g. , nevalainen et al .",
    "2003 ; kirsch 2004 ) .",
    "we found that the spectra from the western part of the x - ray ridge were quite different from those from the eastern part ( the boundary is indicated in figure [ region ] ) .",
    "therefore , we divided the data into two regions by the x - ray ridge .",
    "we present our results in the following subsections .",
    "figure [ speca ] shows an example spectrum from the white rectangle in figure [ region ] .",
    "we can see prominent o vii triplets at @xmath15kev , o viii ly@xmath16 at @xmath17kev , ne ix triplets at @xmath18kev , ne x ly@xmath16 at @xmath19kev , mg xi triplets at @xmath20kev lines .",
    "these features are clearly seen in all of the spectra from the western part of the x - ray ridge .",
    "we applied an absorbed non equiliblium ionization model ( the vnei model in xspec v11.3.1 ) to each spectrum ( hamilton et al .",
    "1983 ; borkowski et al .  1994 , 2001 ; liedahl et al .",
    "the free parameters in our analysis are the electron temperature , @xmath21 ; the ionization parameter , @xmath22 ; the emission measure ( hereafter em ; em = @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the number densities of electrons and ions , respectively , and @xmath26 is the plasma depth ) ; the abundances and the column density , @xmath27 , of the absorbing foreground material . above",
    ", @xmath22 is the electron density times the elapsed time after shock heating",
    ". only the abundances of c , n , o , ne , mg , fe are free , and the others are frozen to the solar values ( anders , grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "we set the abundances of c and n equal to that of o. all of the spectra are represented by a single - temperature vnei model .",
    "the reduced @xmath28 is 11.5 for about 85% of the region to the west of the x - ray ridge .",
    "the remaining ( only 15% in the west of the ridge ) regions , which are located near the ridge and have a high surface brightness , show about 1.51.8 .",
    "these values are far from acceptable from a statistical point of view .",
    "these regions are very close to the interaction region with the interstellar cloud .",
    "we could not obtain better fits by adding extra components there .",
    "therefore , our model is too simple to reproduce the entire region . a more advanced model will be needed to obtain a better fit , particularly near the x - ray ridge . in table 1",
    ", we show the best - fit parameters of the spectrum from the white rectangle .    figure [ kte_tau ] shows the values of @xmath21 and a log@xmath22 contour map in the western part of the x - ray ridge overlaid on the mos-1@xmath8mos-2 image . the value of @xmath21 shows the highest ( 0.32@xmath29kev ) at the ridge and a gradual decrease in the west down to 0.25@xmath30kev .",
    "the spatial variation of log@xmath22 shows an anti - correlation with that of @xmath21 .",
    "most of the regions , having relatively low @xmath21 , show @xmath22 @xmath31 , which indicates a collisional ionization equilibrium condition .",
    "however , the regions near the x - ray ridge , having a relatively high @xmath21 , show that @xmath22 is ( 4.87.2)@xmath32 , which indicates a nonequilibrium ionization condition .",
    "figure [ abundances ] shows contour maps of metal abundances .",
    "they are heavily overabundant , except for fe , at any regions in the map ; the values of the abundances relative to the solar values are o @xmath0 , ne @xmath1 , mg @xmath1 , fe@xmath2 .",
    "these values support the idea that shrapnel d originates from the explosion ejecta .",
    "a weak x - ray emission comes from the eastern part of the x - ray ridge .",
    "we found that the spectra from the eastern part of the x - ray ridge were quite different from those of the western part .",
    "we divided the eastern part into two regions .",
    "we found that the spectrum from the region near the optical filament could be well fitted with a single component with solar abundances .",
    "it shows a relatively low @xmath21 ( @xmath70.15kev ) .",
    "sankrit et al .  (",
    "2003 ) found that optical emission comes from a shock - excited cloud with solar abundances .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the low-@xmath21 component represents plasma originating from the cloud .",
    "we also found that the spectrum varies between the optical filament and the x - ray ridge .",
    "we analyzed the spatial variation of the spectra between them .",
    "we extracted spectra from rectangular regions ( @xmath33 ) drawn by the white line in figure [ reg_omap ] a , each of which overlapped adjacent regions by the half width . in this way we extracted 5 spectra .",
    "we found that the spectra were not represented by a single - temperature vnei model .",
    "therefore , we added an extra component with different @xmath21 . due to the insufficient photon statistics of the low-@xmath21 component above the o - line energy",
    ", we assumed solar abundances for all elements , except o. the extra component improves the fit ( e.g. , reduced @xmath28 is improved from 1.7 to 1.2 ) , which is in contrast to that of the western part .",
    "the @xmath21 values of these two components are 0.15kev and 0.35kev , while the intensity fraction varies from east to west .",
    "the abundances of the high @xmath21 component are similar to those of the western part of the x - ray ridge , which shows that it comes from the ejecta .",
    "the abundance of o and @xmath21 for the low-@xmath21 component are similar to those for the cloud component .",
    "therefore , the low-@xmath21 component is considered to originate from the cloud . the fraction of the cloud component decreases toward the x - ray ridge .",
    "we show the variation of em corrected by the interstellar absorption as a function of the location in figure [ emvariation ] .",
    "the em of the cloud component decreases toward the x - ray ridge , while that of the ejecta increases toward the same direction .",
    "it is reasonable to consider that this feature is due to the projection effect , as looking obliquely between the cloud and the ejecta .",
    "we consider that the boundary region between these two plasmas is a contact discontinuity .      in the x - ray surface brightness map",
    ", we found wavelike structures at the northeastern region of the fov in figure [ reg_omap ] a. figure [ reg_omap ] b shows a band ratio map of the oviii band ( 624684ev ) / the ovii band ( 545603ev ) , in which the wavelike structures are prominent .",
    "the arrow in figure [ reg_omap ] b shows @xmath34 , a typical length of the wavelike structure , to be @xmath35 pc .    in order to investigate the feature of the wavelike structure , we extracted spectra from regions indicated in figure [ reg_omap ] b. the circular regions with the thick solid line and dashed line are responsible for the regions where the oviii band is dominant , while those with thin line are responsible for the regions where the ovii band is dominant .",
    "all of the spectra are represented by a two - component vnei model , just as those applied in the southeastern region .",
    "it is reasonable to consider that the low - temperature component represents an interstellar cloud , while the high - temperature component represents the ejecta .",
    "then , the cloud dominates in the circular regions with thin line and the ejecta dominate in the circular regions with thick line .",
    "we consider that there is a contact discontinuity in those regions .",
    "figure [ spec12 ] shows the spectrum from the dashed circle indicated in figure [ reg_omap ] b and the best - fit parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "the value of the plasma depth of the ejecta comes from the assumption that the circular shape in figure [ reg_omap ] is due to the spherical shape .",
    "this result suggests that the surface of the contact discontinuity has wavelike structures with a typical length , @xmath34 .",
    "x - ray spectra in the western region of the x - ray ridge can be represented with a single - temperature vnei model .",
    "the abundances of heavy elements , except for fe , are significantly higher than those of solar values in any region in the western part of the x - ray ridge : o @xmath0 , ne @xmath1 , mg @xmath1 , fe @xmath2 . the absolute abundance obtained by",
    "the spectral fits depends on the model employed , whereas the relative abundances among the heavy elements are robust .",
    "the relative abundances , ( o / fe , ne / fe and mg / fe ) are @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "high - z elements , like ar , ca , and fe , are generated dominantly in a type - ia sn ( nomoto et al .",
    "1984 ) , while low - z elements , like o , ne , mg , and si , are generated in a type - ii sn ( thielemann et al .",
    "the relative abundances indicate a type - ii sn origin rather than type - ia .",
    "since vela snr is believed to be a type - ii sn , we conclude that shrapnel d is ejecta originating from an explosion of vela sn .",
    "we estimated the total mass of the ejecta of vela shrapnel d. we assumed that shrapnel d has a conical structure with a diameter 80@xmath36 and a height of 45@xmath36 . using a distance of 250 pc , and the assumption of uniform electron density of @xmath37 , we can estimate the total mass to be about @xmath38 .",
    "we found that shrapnel d is ejecta coming from o , ne and mg - rich layer of a progenitor star .",
    "this is contrast to the fact that shrapnel a comes from the si rich layer ( tsunemi et al .",
    "1999 , miyata et al .",
    "these findings suggest that shrapnel d comes from an outer layer of the progenitor star than shrapnel a. we compare the present distance from the center of vela snr to shrapnel d with that to shrapnel a. aschenbach et al .",
    "( 1995 ) inferred the temperature of shrapnel d to be 0.34@xmath40.07kev from the opening angle of the feature and the temperature of the ambient medium .",
    "the opening angle was estimated based on the assumption that the shrapnel is moving in the plane of the sky .",
    "the measured temperature ( 0.32@xmath40.01kev ) is in good agreement with that inferred from the geometry , which supports that shrapnel d is moving in the plane of the sky .",
    "therefore , the actual distance of shrapnel d from the center of vela snr is shorter than that of shrapnel a. since shrapnel d is considered to have come from the outer layer of a progenitor star than shrapnel a , it suggests that a part of the inner layer has a higher initial velocity than that of the outer layer .    in the southeastern region of the fov",
    ", there is an optical filament , a pencil nebula , rcw 37 , running parallel to the x - ray ridge about @xmath39 to the east .",
    "we confirmed that the emission from the optical filament region comes from a shock - excited cloud ( sankrit et al .",
    "we found the spectrum variation in the region between the x - ray ridge and the pencil nebula .",
    "an extra component is needed to fit the spectrum .",
    "the low - temperature component shows solar abundances , while the high - temperature component shows high metal abundances .",
    "the fraction of the low - temperature component gradually decreases toward the x - ray ridge , while that of the high - temperature component increases .",
    "therefore , the low - temperature component is considered to come from the cloud and the high - temperature component is considered to come from the ejecta .",
    "we found wavelike structures in the northeastern region of the fov in the x - ray surface brightness map .",
    "this structure is more apparent in the band ratio map between the oviii band and the ovii band .",
    "furthermore , our spectral analysis indicates that a contact discontinuity between the ejecta and the interstellar cloud has wavelike structures .",
    "the wavelike structures remind us of the rayleigh  taylor ( r  t )",
    "instability , which occurs where a heavy fluid is accelerated by a light one ( i.e. , the pressure of the light fluid is higher than that of the heavy one ) . in our case , the temperature of the measured ejecta ( @xmath40 ) exceeds that of the cloud ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "therefore , if this is the case , the heavy fluid must be the cloud and the light one must be the ejecta . the typical scale of r  t instability is given by ( velazquez et al .",
    "1998 )    @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44    here , @xmath45 is the effective gravity ( inertial force on a frame of the contact discontinuity ) , @xmath46 , the number density of the cloud and @xmath47 that of the ejecta .",
    "we assumed the cloud depth to be 0.73 pc (= 10@xmath36 ) in order to estimate @xmath46 .",
    "the value of @xmath45 is given by ( @xmath48)(@xmath49 ) ( ebisuzaki et al .",
    "1989 ) , where @xmath49 is the pressure gradient and @xmath50 is the mean density between the cloud and the ejecta .",
    "we used the approximation that @xmath51 , where @xmath52 represents the pressure difference between two fluids .",
    "we consider that the temperatures of the cloud and the ejecta come from shock heating .",
    "after shock heating , the ion temperature would not be equal to that of the electron .",
    "then , the electron and ion temperatures vary smoothly to reach the thermal equilibrium .",
    "the postshock electron and ion temperatures equilibrate rapidly after a slow shock , even when the shock is collisionless ( ghavamian et al .",
    "therefore , we assumed thermal equilibrium between the ion and the electron , @xmath53 ( @xmath54 are the ion and the electron pressure , respectively ) , because the shock speed is only about 150 @xmath55 ( sankrit et al .",
    "2003 ) in our case .",
    "based on the assumption of @xmath53 , the pressure difference between the cloud and the ejecta becomes @xmath56 ( @xmath57 is the electron pressure difference between the cloud and the ejecta ) . using the values obtained by the spectral fitting ( from the dashed circle shown in table 1 ) , we obtained @xmath58 as    @xmath59 where @xmath60 @xmath61    we found that @xmath58 is close to @xmath34 .",
    "since the value of @xmath62 strongly depends on the plasma depth , the value of @xmath58 also depends on the plasma depth .",
    "it is highly probable that the wavelike structures are caused by the r  t instability .    in the southeastern region of the fov ( around the optical filament )",
    ", we can not see wavelike structures . in this region",
    ", we find @xmath63 , and the pressure of the ejecta is lower than that of the cloud , where the contact discontinuity is stable .",
    "we observed shrapnel d with the xmm - newton satellite .",
    "we found an x - ray bright ridge structure running from north to south .",
    "we found that the spectra from the western part of the x - ray ridge could be represented by a single @xmath21 component with high metal abundances : o @xmath0 , ne @xmath1 , mg @xmath1 , fe @xmath2 .",
    "this clearly shows that the origin of shrapnel d is ejecta from vela sn .",
    "the spectra from the eastern part of the x - ray ridge were represented by two @xmath21 components .",
    "the low - temperature component having solar abundance is considered to come from the interstellar cloud , while the high - temperature component is considered to come from the ejecta .",
    "this is the place where the ejecta are interacting with the interstellar cloud . in the southeastern region of the fov",
    ", it is reasonable to think that we see the interaction obliquely due to the projection effect . in the northeastern region of the fov , it is highly probable that we see the wavelike structure of the r  t instability .",
