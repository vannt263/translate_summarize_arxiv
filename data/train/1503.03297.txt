    "examinee ability is measured by the scores obtained by an examinee in a test designed to assess such ability . as with all other measurements , this ability measurement too is fundamentally uncertain or inclusive of errors . in classical test theory ,",
    "quantification of the complementary certainty , or reliability of a test , is defined as the ratio of the true score variance and the observed score variance i.e. reliability is defined as the proportion of observed test score variance that is attributable to true score . here",
    ", the observed score is treated as inclusive of the measurement error .",
    "this theoretical definition notwithstanding , there are different methods of obtaining reliability in practice , and problems arise from the implementation of these different techniques even for the same test .",
    "importantly , it is to be noted that the different methods of estimating reliability coefficients differ differently from the aforementioned classical or theoretical definition of reliability .",
    "this can potentially result in different estimates of reliability of a particular test even for the same examinee sample . berkowitz_2000",
    "defined reliability as the degree to which test scores for a group of test takers are consistent over repeated applications of the test , and are therefore inferred to be dependable and repeatable for an individual test taker . in this framework , high reliability means that the test is trustworthy . jacobs_1991 and satterly_1994 have opined that another way to express reliability is in terms of the standard error of measurement .",
    "rudner_2002 mentioned that it is impossible to calculate a reliability coefficient that conforms to the theoretical definition of the ratio of true score variance and observed score variance .",
    "webb_2006 have suggested that the theoretical reliability coefficient is not practical since true scores of individuals taking the test are not known .",
    "in fact , none of the existing methods of finding reliability is found to be isomorphic to the classical definition .    in this paper",
    "we present a new methodology to compute the classically defined reliability coefficient of a multiple - choice binary test , i.e. a test , responses to the questions of which is either correct or incorrect , fetching a score of 1 or 0 respectively .",
    "thus , our method gives the reliability as per the classical definition  thereby avoiding confusion about different reliability values of a given test .",
    "the method that we advance does not resort to multiple testing , i.e. administering the same test multiple times to a given examinee cohort .",
    "while avoiding multiple testing , this method has the important additional benefit of identifying the way of splitting of the test , in order to ensure that the split halves are equivalent ( or parallel ) , so that they approach maximal correlation and therefore maximal split - half reliability .",
    "we offer an interval estimate of the true score of any individual examinee whose obtained score is known .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss the methods of finding reliability as found in the current literature . in section  [ sec : batt_rel ] , we present a similar discussion , but this time , in regard to a set or battery of tests . our method of finding the reliability as per the classical definition , is expounded upon in section  [ sec : method ] ; this is based upon a novel method of splitting a test into two parallel halves using a new iterative algorithm that is discussed in section  [ sec : dichot ] along with the benefits of this iterative scheme . subsequently , we proceed to discuss the computation of the reliability of a battery of tests using summative scores and weighted scores ( section  [ sec : weights ] ) .",
    "empirical verification of the presented methodology is undertaken using four sets of simulated data ( in section  [ sec : simulated ] ) .",
    "implementation of the method to real data is discussed in section  [ sec : real ] .",
    "we round up the paper in section  [ sec : conclu ] , by recalling the salient outcomes of the work .",
    "in the multiple testing ( or the test - retest ) approach , the main concern is that the correlation between test scores coming from distinct administrations , depends on the time gap between the administrations , since the sample may learn or forget something in between and also get acquainted to the test .",
    "thus , different values of reliability can be obtained depending on the time gap @xcite . also , test - retest reliability primarily reflects stability of scores and may vary depending on the homogeneity of groups of examinees @xcite .    in the split half method ,",
    "the test is divided into two sub - tests , i.e. the whole set of questions is divided into two sets of questions and the entire instrument is administered to one examinee sample . the split - half reliability estimate is the correlation between scores of these two parallel halves , though researchers like kaplan_2001 recommend finding reliability of the entire test using the spearman - brown formula .",
    "value of the split - half reliability depends on how the test is dichotomised .",
    "we acknowledge that a test consisting of 2@xmath0-number of items can be split in half in @xmath1 number of ways and that each method of splitting will imply a distinct value of reliability in general . in this context",
    ", it merits mention that it is of crucial importance to identify that way of splitting that ensures that the split halves are parallel and the split - half reliability is maximum .    in attempts to compute reliability based on `` internal consistency '' , the aim is to quantify how well the questions in the test , or test `` items '' , reflect the same construct .",
    "these include the usage of cronbach s alpha ( @xmath2 ) : the average of all possible split - half estimates of reliability , computed as a function of the ratio of the total of the variance of the items and variance of the examinee scores . here",
    ", the `` item score '' is the total of the scores obtained in that item by all the examinees who are taking the test , while an examinee score is the total score of such an examinee , across all the items in the test .",
    "@xmath2 can be shown to provide a lower bound for the reliability under certain assumptions",
    ". limitations of this method have been reported by eisinga_2012 and ritter_2010 .",
    "panayides_2013 observed that high values of @xmath2 do not necessarily mean higher reliability and better quality of scales or tests .",
    "in fact very high values of @xmath2 could be indicating lengthy scales , a narrow coverage of the construct under consideration and/or parallel items @xcite or redundancy of items @xcite . in another approach ,",
    "referred to as the `` parallel forms '' approach , the test is divided into two forms or sub - tests by randomly selecting the test items to comprise either sub - test , under the assumption that the randomly divided halves are parallel or equivalent .",
    "such a demand of parallelity requires generating lots of items that reflect the same construct , which is difficult to achieve in practice .",
    "this approach is very similar to the split - half reliability described above , except that the parallel forms constructed herein , can be used independently of each other and are considered equivalent . in practice",
    ", this assumption of strict parallelity is too restrictive .",
    "each of the above method of estimation of reliability has certain advantages and disadvantages .",
    "however , the estimation of the reliability coefficient under each such method deviates differently from the theoretical definition and consequently , gives different values for reliability of a single test .",
    "in general , test - retest reliability with significant time gap is lower in value than the parallel forms reliability and reliability computed under the model of internal consistency amongst the test items .",
    "to summarise , there is a potency for confusion over the trustworthiness of a test , emanating out of the inconsistencies amongst the different available methods that are implemented to compute reliability coefficients .",
    "this state of affairs motivates a need to estimate reliability in an easily reproducible way , from a single administration of the test , using the theoretical definition of reliability i.e. as a ratio of true score variance and observed score variance .",
    "bock_1966 derived reliability of a battery using multivariate analysis of variance ( manova ) , where @xmath3 number of parallel forms of a test battery were given to each individual in the examinee sample .",
    "it can be proved that average canonical reliabilities from manova coincides with the canonical reliability for the mahalanobis distant function .",
    "wood_1987 compared three multivariate models ( canonical reliability model , maximum generalisability model , canonical correlation model ) for estimating reliability of test battery and observed that the maximum generalisability model showed the least degree of bias , smallest errors in estimation , and the greatest relative efficiency across all experimental conditions .",
    "ogasawara_2009 considered four estimators of the reliability of a composite score based on a factor analysis approach , and five estimators of the maximal reliability for the composite scores and found that the same estimators are obtained when wishart maximum likelihood estimators are used .",
    "conger_1973 considered canonical reliability as the ratio of the average squared distance among the true scores to the average squared distance among the observed scores .",
    "they thereby showed that the canonical reliability is consistent with multivariate analogues of parallel forms of correlation , squared correlation between true and observed scores and an analysis of variance formulation .",
    "they opined that the factors corresponding to the small eigenvalues might show significant differences and should not be discarded .",
    "equivalences amongst canonical factor analysis , canonical reliability and principal component analysis were studied by conger_1976 ; they found that if variables are scaled so that they have equal measurement errors , then canonical factor analysis on all non - error variance , principal component analysis and canonical reliability analysis , give rise to equivalent results .    in this paper ,",
    "the objective is to present a methodology for obtaining reliability as per its theoretical definition from a single administration of a test , and to extend this methodology to find ways of obtaining reliability of a battery of tests .",
    "consider a test consisting of @xmath4 items , administered to @xmath5 persons .",
    "the test score of the @xmath6-th examinee is @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is referred to as the test score vector .",
    "the vector @xmath10 depicts the maximum possible scores for the test where @xmath11 @xmath12 . here @xmath13",
    "where we refer to @xmath14 as the @xmath5-dimensional person space . sorting the components of @xmath15 in increasing",
    "order will produce a merit list for thesample of examinees , in terms of the observed scores and thereby help infer the ability distribution of the sample of examinees .",
    "however , parameters of the test can be obtained primarily in terms of the 2-norm of the vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the angle @xmath19 between these two vectors .",
    "mean of the test scores @xmath20 is given as follows .",
    ". similarly , mean of the true score vector @xmath22 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the angle between the true score vector and the ideal score vector @xmath25 .",
    "test variance @xmath26 can also be obtained in this framework . for @xmath5 persons who take the test , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath6-th deviation score , @xmath29 .",
    "the relationship between the norm of deviation score and norm of test score can be easily derived as @xmath30 similarly , @xmath31 where @xmath32 .    using this relationship between deviation and test scores",
    ", test variance can be rephrased as @xmath33    the aforementioned relationship between test and deviation scores gives @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    at the same time ,",
    "in classical test theory , the means of the observed and true scores coincide , i.e. @xmath36 , as in this framework , the observed score is represented as the sum of true score ( obtained under the paradigm of no errors ) and the error , where the error is assumed to be distributed as a normal with zero mean and variance referred to as the error variance . then recalling the definition of these sample means , we get @xmath37    this gives the relationship amongst @xmath17 , @xmath38 , @xmath24 , @xmath19 .",
    "the stage is now set for us to develop the methodology for computing reliability using the classical definition .",
    "reliability , @xmath39 , of a test is defined clasically as @xmath40 .",
    "thus , to know @xmath39 one needs to know the value of the true score variance or the error variance . for this , let us concentrate on parallel tests .",
    "as per the classical definition , two tests `` @xmath41 '' and `` @xmath42 '' are parallel if @xmath43 where the superscript `` @xmath41 '' refers to sub - test @xmath41 and superscript `` @xmath42 '' to sub - test @xmath42 , and @xmath44 is the standard deviation of the error scores in the @xmath45-th sub - test , @xmath46 .",
    "thus , @xmath47 is the true score of the @xmath6-th examinee in the @xmath41-th test and @xmath48 that in the @xmath42-th test .",
    "similarly , the observed scores of the @xmath6-th examinee , in the two tests , are @xmath49 and @xmath49 .    from here on , we interpret `` g '' and `` h '' as the two parallel sub - tests that a given test is dichotomised into .",
    "this implies that the observed score vectors of these two parallel tests can be represented by two points @xmath50 and @xmath51 , in @xmath14 such that @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the paradigm of classical test theory , where @xmath54 is the error score in the @xmath45-th test , @xmath55 .",
    "( here @xmath56 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "now , recalling that for parallel tests @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath57 , so that @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the angle between @xmath50 and @xmath51 while @xmath60 is the angle between @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "but , the correlation of the errors in two parallel tests is zero ( follows from equality of standard deviation of error sores in the parallel sub - tests and equality of means of the error scores  see equation  [ eqn : theta_t_x ] ) .",
    "the geometrical interpretation of this is that the error vectors of the two parallel tests are orthogonal , i.e. @xmath63 .",
    "then equation  [ eqn:1sstep ] can be written as +    @xmath64    @xmath65    where we have used equality of error variances of parallel tests in the last step .",
    "equations  [ eqn:2ndstep ] can be employed to find the value of @xmath66 from the data ( on observed scores ) . in other words",
    ", we can use the available test score data in this equation to achieve the error variance of either parallel sub - test that a test can be dichotomised into . alternatively ,",
    "if two parallel tests exist , then equations  [ eqn:2ndstep ] can be invoked to compute the error variance in either of the two parallel tests .",
    "now , equations  [ eqn:2ndstep ] suggest that the error variance @xmath67 of the entire test is @xmath68 then recalling that in the paradigm of classical test theory , the true score is by definition independent of the error , it follows that the observed score variance @xmath26 is sum of true score variance @xmath69 and error variance @xmath67 the classical definition of reliability gives    @xmath70    @xmath71    as @xmath72 , equation  [ eqn:3rdstep ] can be simplified to give @xmath73 since @xmath74 for parallel tests , given that @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "equation  [ eqn:3rdstep ] and equation  [ eqn:4thstep ] give a unique way of finding reliability of a test from a single administration , using the classical definition of reliability as long as dichotomisation of the test is performed into two parallel sub - tests .",
    "importantly , in this framework , the hypothesis of equality of error variances of the two halves of a given test can be tested using an f - test .",
    "in addition , the method also provides a way to estimate true scores from the data .",
    "we discuss this later in this section .",
    "chakrabartty_2011 gave a method for splitting a test into 2 parallel halves .",
    "here we give a novel method of splitting a test into 2 parallel halves@xmath41 and @xmath42that have nearly equal means and variances of the observed scores .",
    "the splitting is initiated by the determination of the item - wise total score for each item .",
    "so let the @xmath77-th item in the test have the item - wise score @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the @xmath6-th examinee s score in the @xmath77-th item , @xmath80 .",
    "our method of splitting is as follows .    1 .",
    "the item - wise scores are sorted in an ascending order resulting in the ordered sequence @xmath81 . following this ,",
    "the item with the highest total score is identified and allocated to the @xmath41-th sub - test . the item with second highest total score",
    "is then allocated to the @xmath42-th test , while the item with the third highest score is assigned to @xmath42-th test and the fourth highest to the @xmath41-th test , and so on . in other words ,",
    "allocation of items is performed to ensure realisation of the following structure .",
    "+ [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]      we implement the splitting of the real test score data into the scores in the @xmath41 and @xmath42 sub - tests to compute the reliability as per the theoretical definition , i.e. as given in equation  [ eqn:4thstep ] . then using the observed sub - test score vectors @xmath82 and @xmath83 we get the classically defined reliability to be @xmath84",
    ". then @xmath85 . on the other hand ,",
    "the pearson product moment correlation between @xmath82 and @xmath83 is @xmath860.9941 . in other words ,",
    "the split - half reliability is @xmath87 .",
    "we can now proceed to estimate the true scores following the discussion presented in section  [ sec : true_score ] . for the observed score @xmath7",
    ", the estimated true score is @xmath88 ( as per equation  [ eqn : te ] and discussions thereafter ) , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the true scores can also be estimated using the split - half reliability instead of the reliability from the classical definition .",
    "then the above regression coefficients @xmath91 and @xmath92 are computed as above , except this time , @xmath39 is replaced by @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "we present the true scores estimated using both the reliability from the classical definition ( @xmath95 in black ) as well as the split - half reliability ( @xmath96 in red ) in figure  [ figure : t_est ] . in this figure ,",
    "the errors in the estimated true scores are superimposed as error bars on this estimate , in respective colours .",
    "this error is considered to be @xmath97 , where the error variance is @xmath98 when the classically defined reliability is implemented and @xmath99 when the split - half reliability is used .",
    "in fact , the method of using @xmath93 in the estimation of the true scores will result in the true scores @xmath96 being over - estimated for @xmath100 and under - estimated for @xmath101 , as shown in theorem  [ theorem : over ] .",
    "this can be easily corroborated in our results in figure  [ figure : t_est ] ; the higher value of @xmath93 ( than of @xmath39 ) results in @xmath102 for @xmath100 and in @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "figure  [ figure : t_est ] also includes the sample probability distribution of the point estimate of the true score obtained from the linear regression model suggested in equation  [ eqn : te ] , given the observed scores and using @xmath39 and @xmath93 , i.e. @xmath105 , where @xmath3 is the reliability .",
    "we invoke the lookup table that gives the examinee indices corresponding to a point estimate of the true score .",
    "then the percentile rank of all those examinees whose true score is ( point ) estimated as @xmath106 , is given as @xmath107 .",
    "( this lookup table is not included in the text for brevity s sake ) .",
    "for example , the true score @xmath108 is estimated using @xmath109 , for examinees with indices 893 , 867 , 210 , 837 , 834 , 408 , 706 , 690 , 655 , 653 , 161 , 638 , 312 , 308 , 149 , 290 , 539 , 260 .",
    "then the percentile rank of all these examinees is about 93 .",
    "thus , our method of splitting the test into 2 parallel halves helps to find a unique measure of reliability as per the classical definition , for a given real data set . using this we can then estimate true scores for each observed score in the data .      in order to illustrate our method of finding weights relevant to the computation of the classically defined weighted reliability of a test battery ( equation  [ eqn : rel_bat_wt ] ) , we employ real life test data",
    "sets data - ii(a ) and data - ii(b ) .",
    "these data sets comprise the examinee scores of 784 examinees who took 2 tests ( aimed at selection for a position ) .",
    "the test that resulted in data - ii(a ) aimed at measuring examinee verbal ability , while the test for which data - ii(b ) was the result , measured ability to interpret data .",
    "the former test contained 18 items and the latter 22 items .",
    "histograms of examinee scores and item scores of these 2 tests are shown in figure  [ figure : histos_batt ] .",
    "the mean and variance of the 2 tests corresponding to data - ii(a ) and data - ii(b ) are approximately 4.30 , 6.25 and 4.20 , 4.06 respectively .",
    "the battery comprising these two tests is considered for its reliability .",
    "we split each test into 2 parallel halves using our method of dichotomisation delineated in section  [ sec : dichot ] . splitting data - ii(b )",
    "results in 2 halves , the means of the examinee scores of which are about 2.10 and the variances of the examinee scores are about 1.80 and 1.65 .",
    "reliability defined classically ( equation  [ eqn:4thstep ] ) computed using these split halves is about 0.35 .",
    "the correlation between the split halves is about 0.90 . on the other hand , splitting data - ii(a ) results in 2 halves , the means of which are equal to about 2.15 and the variances of which are about 1.87 and 2.19 .",
    "classically defined reliability of this test using these split halves , turns out be 0.66 approximately .",
    "the correlation coefficient between the two halves is about 0.95 .",
    "the true scores estimated for both observed data sets are shown in figure  [ figure : batt ] , with errors of estimation superimposed as @xmath97 where @xmath110 is the variance of the error scores that are modelled as distributed as @xmath111 .        using the scores in the 2 tests in the considered battery ,",
    "namely sets data - ii(a ) and data - ii(b ) , we compute the variance - covariance matrix @xmath112 of the observed scores ( see equation  [ eqn : de ] ) .",
    "then in this example , @xmath112 is a 2@xmath1132 matrix , the diagonal elements of which are the variances of the 2 tests and the off - diagonal elements are the covariances of the examinee test score vectors @xmath114 and @xmath115 of these 2 tests . then in this example real - life test battery , recalling that @xmath116 we get + @xmath117 then the weights are @xmath118 0.7028 and 0.2972 ( to 4 significant figures ) .    then recalling",
    "that ( upto 4 decimal places ) the reliability and test variance of the 2 tests the score data of which are data - ii(a ) and data - ii(b ) are 0.6571 , 6.2405 and 0.3488 , 4.0571 respectively , the covariance between the 2 tests is 2.4571 , we use equation  [ eqn : rel_bat_wt ] to compute the reliability of this real battery to be approximately + @xmath119    thus , using our method of splitting a test in two parallel halves , we have been able to compute reliability of the test as per the classical definition and extended this to compute the reliability of a real battery comprising two tests . for",
    "the used real data sets data - ii(a ) and data - ii(b ) , the battery reliability turns out to be about 0.71 .",
    "the paper presents a new , easily calculable split - half method of achieving reliability of tests , using the classical definition where the basic idea implemented is that the square of the magnitude of the difference between the score vectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 of @xmath5 examinees in the @xmath41 and @xmath42 sub - tests obtained by splitting the full test , is proportional to the variance @xmath110 of the errors in the scores obtained by the examinees who take the test , i.e. @xmath121 . here , working within the paradigm of classical test theory , the error in an examinee s score is the difference between the observed and true scores of the examinee .",
    "our method of splitting the test is iterative in nature and has the desirable properties that the sample distribution of the split halves are nearly coincident , indicating the approximately equal means and variances of the split halves . importantly",
    ", the splitting method that we use , ensures maximum split - half correlation between the split halves and the splitting is performed on the basis of difficulty of the items ( or questions ) of the test , rather than examinee attributes .",
    "a crucial feature of this method of splitting is that the splitting being in terms of item difficulty , the method requires very low computational resources to split a very large test data set into two nearly coincident halves . in other words , our method",
    "can easily be implemented to find the classically defined reliability using test data that is obtained by collating responses from a very large sample of examinees , on whom a test of as large or as small a number of items has been administered . in our demonstration of this method , a moderately large real test on 912 examinees and 50 items , convergence to optimum splitting ( splitting into halves that share equal means and nearly equal variances ) was achieved in about 0.024 seconds .",
    "implementation of sets of toy data , generated under different model choices for examinee ability was undertaken : 999 examinees responding to a 50-item test , as well as much larger cohorts of examinees500,000 to 50,000taking a 50-item test , and a cohort of 1000 examinees taking 100 to 1000-item tests .",
    "the order of our splitting algorithm is corroborated to be quadratic in half of the number of items in the test , while computational time for reliability computation ( input+output times , in addition to splitting of the test ) varies linearly with examinee sample size , so that even for the 500,000 examinees taking the 50-item test , reliability is computed to be less than 10 seconds .",
    "once the reliability of the test is computed , it is exploited to perform interval estimation of the true score of each examinee , where the error of this estimation is modelled as the test error variance .",
    "subsequent to the dichotomisation of the test , we invoke a simple linear regression model for the true score of an examinee , given the observed score @xmath122 , to achieve an interval estimate of the true score , where the interval is modelled as @xmath123 .",
    "we recognise this interval to be in excess of @xmath124 standard deviation of the error of estimation of the true score for a given @xmath122 , as provided by the regression model ; in other words , our estimation of uncertainty on the estimated true score is pessimistic .",
    "this method of splitting a test into 2 parallel halves , forms the basis of our computation of the reliability of a battery , i.e. a set of tests , as per the classical definition .",
    "a weighted battery score is used in this computation where we implement a new way for the determination of the weights , by invoking a lagrange multiplier based solution .",
    "we illustrate the implementation of this method of determining weights  and thereby of computing the reliability of a test battery following the computation of the reliabilities of the component test as per the classical definition  on a real test battery that comprises 2 component tests .    we have presented a new method of computing reliability as per the classical definition , and demonstrated its proficiency and simplicity .",
    "thus , it is possible to uniquely find test characteristics like reliability or error variance from the data , and such can be adopted while reporting the results of the administered test . in this paradigm , testing of hypothesis of equality of error variance from two tests will help to compare the tests .",

    "<S> as with all measurements , the measurement of examinee ability , in terms of scores that the examinee obtains in a test , is also error - ridden . </S>",
    "<S> the quantification of such error or uncertainty in the test score data  or rather the complementary test reliability  is pursued within the paradigm of classical test theory in a variety of ways , with no existing method of finding reliability , isomorphic to the theoretical definition that parametrises reliability as the ratio of the true score variance and observed ( i.e. error - ridden ) score variance . </S>",
    "<S> thus , multiple reliability coefficients for the same test have been advanced . </S>",
    "<S> this paper describes a much needed method of obtaining reliability of a test as per its theoretical definition , via a single administration of the test , by using a new fast method of splitting of a given test into parallel halves , achieving near - coincident empirical distributions of the two halves . </S>",
    "<S> the method has the desirable property of achieving splitting on the basis of difficulty of the questions ( or items ) that constitute the test , thus allowing for fast computation of reliability even for very large test data sets , i.e. test data obtained by a very large examinee sample . </S>",
    "<S> an interval estimate for the true score is offered , given an examinee score , subsequent to the determination of the test reliability . </S>",
    "<S> this method of finding test reliability as per the classical definition can be extended to find reliability of a set or battery of tests ; a method for determination of the weights implemented in the computation of the weighted battery score is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we perform empirical illustration of our method on real and simulated tests , and on a real test battery comprising two constituent tests .    , </S>"
