    "on the other hand , if we do not tune the initial conditions on the _ exact _ breather solution , i.e. if the vibrational contributions from the peripheral particles are not equal to zero , we obtain a certain _ quasibreather _ @xcite .",
    "this spatially localized dynamical object is characterized by different frequencies appearing from the peripheral particles .",
    "the difference in frequencies is brought about by the phenomenon typical for nonlinear dynamics , namely , by the dependence of the frequency on the vibrational amplitude .    in @xcite",
    ", we proposed to characterize the proximity of the quasibreather to an exact time - periodic breather with the aid of the mean square deviations in frequencies of the individual particles and that of the fixed particle in time ( there exist a certain temporal drift of the frequency of every chosen particle ) .",
    "we also presented there some arguments ( at least , for the case of @xmath143 chain ) for the possibility of the quasibreather stability despite of the absence of the time periodicity .",
    "however , we can not now present any refine mathematical proof on quasibreather stability for infinite time .",
    "on the other hand , one often reveals that the lifetime of a quasibreather , if it actually decays in time , can be exponantionally large for small deviations from the exact breather .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ f52 ] , we depict the time evolution of the quasibreather in the weakly coupled duffing chain which lives , at least , up to @xmath144 .     an extremely long - lived quasibreather for the duffing chain  ( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath47 particles which , possibly , is a stable dynamical object [ @xmath12 ,  @xmath15 , @xmath145 , @xmath146.,width=529,height=207 ]    finally , since we can not tune exactly on the strictly time periodic breather solution in any physical experiment ( and even in numerical experiments ) , quasibreathers seem to be much more relevant spatially localized dynamical objects than the exact discrete breathers . some additional detail for this point of view can be found in @xcite .",
