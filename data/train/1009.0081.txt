    "the superior physical properties of graphene  @xcite and its compatibility with two - dimensional lithographic processes have stimulated intense research of graphene - based electronics for `` beyond si - cmos '' technology  @xcite .",
    "one of the major challenges for realizing the graphene - based beyond si - cmos technology is the fabrication of high - quality large - area graphene sheets and the retention of superior electronic characteristics of graphene .",
    "the apparent degradation of carrier mobility and significant variations in the electronic characteristics when graphene comes in contact with various dielectrics  @xcite suggest significant susceptibility of the single - layer carbon atoms to the surrounding environment . on the other hand",
    ", the strong susceptibility of graphene to external influences also provides opportunities for engineering unique properties of graphene .",
    "for instance , it has been theoretically proposed that a designed strain aligned along three main crystallographic directions induces strong gauge fields that effectively act as a uniform magnetic field on the dirac electrons  @xcite . in particular , for a finite doping level , the quantizing field results in an insulating bulk and a pair of counter - circulating edge states , which is similar to the case of topological insulators  @xcite .",
    "moreover , strained superlattices have been shown theoretically to open significant energy gaps in the electronic spectrum of graphene  @xcite , which could be much more effective than current approaches to the bandgap engineering of graphene by either controlling the width of graphene nano - ribbons  @xcite or applying magnetic fields to bi - layer graphene  @xcite .",
    "recent scanning tunneling microscopic and spectroscopic ( stm / sts ) studies of graphene nano - bubbles on pt(111 ) single crystal substrates  @xcite have verified the theoretical prediction of strain - induced pseudo - magnetic fields , and significant field values in excess of 300 tesla have been observed .    in the context of synthesis of large area graphene",
    ", various growth techniques have been developed to date , including ultra - high - vacuum annealing to desorption of si from sic single crystal surfaces  @xcite , deposition of graphene oxide films from a liquid suspension followed by chemical reduction  @xcite , and chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) on transition metals such as ru  @xcite , ni  @xcite , co  @xcite , pt  @xcite and cu  @xcite . while samples as large as centimeter squared have been achieved , and characterizations of macroscopic physical properties such as raman scattering and mobility measurements have been reported  @xcite , most large - area samples appear to exhibit thicknesses ranging from one to approximately twelve layers .",
    "moreover , few investigations with the exception of refs .",
    "@xcite have been made on correlating the local electronic properties with the microscopic structural variations of these large - area films .    in this work",
    "we report scanning tunneling microscopic and spectroscopic ( stm / sts ) investigations of the microscopic electronic and structural properties of cvd - grown graphene on copper and also on sio@xmath1 after transferred from copper .",
    "we find that the cvd grown graphene is strongly strained so that both the lattice structure and the local electronic density of states ( dos ) of graphene are significantly affected  @xcite .",
    "the non - trivial strain results in significant pseudo - magnetic fields @xmath2 up to @xmath0 tesla , as manifested by the dos peaks at energies corresponding to quantized landau levels @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes both integers and fractional numbers at 0 , @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , significant charging effects are found along the strongest strained areas of the sample , consistent with strain - induced scalar potential . on the other hand , for cvd - grown graphene transferred from copper to sio@xmath1 , both the pseudo - magnetic fields and charging effects diminish in most parts of the sample except for small regions containing topological ridges that can not be relaxed by changing the substrate .",
    "the occurrence of conductance peaks at quantized integer and fractional landau levels in strained graphene is analogous to the magnetic field - induced integer and fractional quantum hall effects ( iqhe and fqhe ) , suggesting that the two - dimensional dirac electrons may be quantum confined into correlated many - body states by strain .",
    "the strained - induced charging effects and quantized states also enable new possibilities of controlling the energy gaps and doping levels of graphene through nano - scale `` strain engineering '' .",
    "our experimental approach to investigating the local electronic and structural correlations of graphene on dielectric or metallic substrates is to perform stm / sts studies using a home built cryogenic stm , which was compatible with high magnetic fields and also capable of variable temperature control from room temperature to 6 k , with a vacuum level of @xmath6 torr at the lowest temperatures . for studies reported in this work ,",
    "the measurement conditions were at 77 k under high vacuum ( @xmath7 torr ) and in zero magnetic field .",
    "the stm tips were made of pt / ir alloy and were produced by mechanical cleavage and electrochemical polishing .",
    "the tips thus prepared were first characterized on graphite for atomic sharpness and then cleaned by gently touching the stm tips to an amorphous gold surface .",
    "both topographic and spectroscopic measurements were performed simultaneously at every location in a ( @xmath8 ) pixel grid . at each pixel location , the tunnel junction was independently established so that the junction resistance of 1.5 g@xmath9 was maintained across the sample .",
    "the differential conductance , ( @xmath10 ) , was calculated from the best polynomial fit of each tunneling current ( @xmath11 ) vs. bias voltage ( @xmath12 ) curve .",
    "the data acquisition typically involved averaging ten @xmath11-vs.-@xmath12 spectra per pixel .",
    "polynomial fitting to successive segments of the averaged @xmath11-vs.-@xmath12 curve at each pixel was made over a finite voltage range , and the @xmath13-vs.-@xmath12 spectrum per pixel was obtained by collecting the derivatives of the best fitted segments at all voltages .",
    "the spectra thus derived are generally consistent with those obtained by superposing a modulated bias voltage with a lock - in amplifier on the @xmath11-vs.-@xmath12 measurements .",
    "however , the modulated - bias technique generally requires much longer time to collect both the spectroscopic and topographical data pixel by pixel over extended areas with high spatial resolution , and so was not employed in this work .",
    "the procedures for cvd growth of graphene on copper foils were similar to those described in literature  @xcite .",
    "briefly , graphene films were primarily grown on 25 @xmath14 m thick , highly polished polycrystalline copper foils in a furnace consisting of a fused silica tube heated in a split tube furnace .",
    "the fused silica tube loaded with copper foils was first evacuated and then back filled with pure hydrogen gas , heated to @xmath15c , and maintained under partial hydrogen pressure with argon .",
    "a flow of methane was subsequently introduced for a desired period of time at a total pressure of 500 mtorr .",
    "finally , the furnace was cooled to room temperature , and the copper foils coated with graphene appeared brighter relative to the as - received copper foils , consistent with previous reports  @xcite .",
    "the graphene sheets thus prepared were found to be largely single- or double - layered based on raman spectroscopic studies . before the stm measurements , a graphene - coated copper foil was first cleaned and then loaded onto the stm probe .",
    "the stm probe was then evacuated to high vacuum condition ( @xmath7 torr ) .",
    "two different cvd - grown graphene samples on copper were studied at 77 k. both topographic and spectroscopic measurements on single - layer graphene regions were carried out on both samples from relatively large area surveys down to atomic - scale investigations .    to transfer cvd - grown graphene samples to sio@xmath1 substrates ,",
    "sio@xmath1 substrates were prepared by first thermally grown a 290 nm thick sio@xmath1 layer on the silicon wafer ( p - type @xmath16 ) , followed by gentle sonication of the substrate in acetone and then pure alcohol for about two minutes .",
    "the substrate was then baked at 115@xmath17c on a hotplate , nitrogen blown dry while being cooled down .",
    "for the cvd - grown graphene on copper , a layer of pmma was first deposited on top of the graphene sample as scaffolding , and then the copper substrate was removed with nitric acid .",
    "next , the pmma / graphene sample was placed on a sio@xmath1 substrate with the graphene side down .",
    "finally , the pmma was removed with acetone .",
    "the transferred graphene was cleaned and annealed in an argon atmosphere at 400@xmath17c for 30 minutes .",
    "finally , electrodes were created by thermally evaporating 2.5 nm chromium and 37.5 nm gold through an aluminum foil shadow mask .",
    "prior to stm measurements , the sample was rinsed again gently with acetone followed by pure alcohol to remove possible organic surface contaminants .",
    "the stm / sts studies on one of the transferred graphene samples on sio@xmath1 were all conducted on the single - layer region .",
    "systematic studies of the cvd grown graphene on copper revealed large height variations everywhere , as exemplified by the topographic images figs .",
    "1a - 1c and the corresponding height histograms in figs .  1d - 1f for one of the two samples .",
    "the ripple - like height variations are consistent with previous reports  @xcite and are primarily associated with two physical causes .",
    "the first is the large difference in the thermal contraction coefficients of graphene and copper .",
    "namely , upon cooling the sample from @xmath15c to room temperature after the cvd growth of graphene , the expanded graphene ( due to its negative thermal contraction coefficient ) can no longer remain flat on the thermally contracted copper foil , thus resulting in large ripples .",
    "the second cause is the original surface roughness of the copper foils , as manifested in fig .",

    "on the other hand , significant short - wavelength height variations , such as those exemplified in figs .",
    "2e - 2f over a small @xmath21 nm@xmath22 area may be primarily attributed to the difference in the thermal contraction coefficients , where the height variations could reach as much as 1 nm over a @xmath21 nm@xmath22 area for both samples so that @xmath23 , which are much larger than those associated with the long - wavelength height variations and therefore suggest significant strain on graphene .",

    "overall , our stm / sts studies of various graphene samples have manifested the strong influence of strain and substrates on the structural rippling effect and the electronic dos of graphene .",
    "we have shown that significant differences between the thermal contraction coefficients of graphene and the transition - metal substrates for cvd growth graphene result in strong and non - uniform lattice distortion at the nano - scale , which provides a new ground for investigating the strain - induced charging and pseudo - magnetic field effects .",
    "in particular , the strain - induced giant pseudo - magnetic fields enable studies of the integer and fractional quantum hall effects associated with the pseudo - spin ( @xmath101 , the valley ) degrees of freedom by exploiting the unique strength of the pseudo - spin - orbit coupling in graphene .",

    "hence , the lack of correlation between the maps in ( c ) and ( d ) implies that the charging effect in relaxed graphene is not directly due to strain and may be attributed to charge impurities on the substrate.,width=316 ]    it is worth pointing out that our observation of pseudo - magnetic field - induced fractionally filled landau levels in graphene may be attributed to the complicated strain distribution at the nano - scale , which ensures both large pseudo - magnetic fields and ballistic behavior of the dirac electrons .",
    "hence , strain - induced charge confinement in two dimensions ( similar to the external magnetic field - induced charge confinement ) gives rise to correlated many - body interactions .",
    "moreover , the significantly more complicated strain distribution found in the cvd - grown graphene - on - copper differs from the controlled strain in the case of graphene nano - bubbles  @xcite where the effective gauge potential leads to a relatively uniform magnetic field over each nano - bubble . therefore , further corrections to the hamiltonian of the dirac electrons are necessary in the case of cvd - grown graphene - on - copper , which may lead to additional terms in the effective gauge potential , similar to the presence of the chern - simons gauge potential terms in the case of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) phenomena .",

    "we further remark that the tunneling spectra acquired from highly strained cvd - grown graphene - on - copper samples contain not only spectral characteristics of the strained graphene but also excess conduction channels associated with the underlying copper substrate .",
