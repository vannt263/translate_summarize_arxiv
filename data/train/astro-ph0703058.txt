    "cold atomic gas contains a large fraction of the mass of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and is a critical precursor to molecular cloud formation . however , this `` cold atomic medium '' is hard to map in isolation , since warmer gas is often brighter in traditional h  i 21cm - line emission observations .",
    "fortunately , with proper angular resolution , cold atomic clouds can be imaged as h  i self - absorption ( hisa ) against warmer background h  i emission ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gibson et al . 2000 ) ) .",
    "recent large - scale radio synthesis surveys like the canadian and vla galactic plane surveys ( cgps : ( * ? ? ?",

    "* figure  [ fig : hisa_example ] * compares some sample cgps hisa to co emission .",
    "the intricate structure of the hisa clouds is clear , as is their frequent lack of apparent co. this lack is a puzzle unless significant h@xmath0 is present without co , since the low temperatures of many hisa features ( @xmath1  k ) are hard to explain without molecular gas .",
    "but if these clouds are evolving rather than stable objects , then perhaps many have not yet formed enough co to detect ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    ", we recently published a hisa census of the @xmath2 area covered by the first 5 years of the cgps ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gibson et al . 2005 ) ) .",
    "as shown in * figure  [ fig : hisa_weak_strong ] * , a low - level froth of weak , disorganized hisa is found throughout the regions of the cgps where the background emission is bright enough for the hisa to be reliably detected .",
    "by contrast , stronger absorption is organized into discrete clouds and complexes .",

    "hisa requires background line emission at the same radial velocity as the foreground cloud .",
    "consequently , hisa radiative transfer probes both the temperature and the velocity field of galactic h  i. the cgps is primarily in the outer galaxy , where pure differential rotation allows only one position along the line of sight to have a particular velocity .",
    "since we detect hisa in the outer galaxy , the real velocity field must be perturbed from this simple rotation model to provide background fields to absorb against .",
    "two known mechanisms for this are turbulence and spiral density waves .",
    "the weak , widespread hisa in * figure  [ fig : hisa_weak_strong ] * can be explained as an ambient froth of cold atomic gas in the ism made visible by turbulent eddies ; perhaps the cold gas is even a product of convergent turbulent flows , as some models suggest ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vzquez - semadeni et al . 2006 ) ) .",
    "the stronger hisa , however , is concentrated into distinct complexes , especially along the perseus arm near @xmath3 , arguing for a more organized mechanism for these features .",
    "the very cold temperatures implied by this strong absorption could arise from gas that is forming h@xmath0 but has not yet formed much co.     portion of the cgps , in which the hisa on - off absorption amplitude is integrated over velocity ( top ) and latitude ( bottom ) , with stronger absorption being darker .",
    "contours mark where the h  i emission background becomes too faint for reliable hisa detection .",

    "* figure  [ fig : hisa_cvgps ] * shows a new hisa survey incorporating the vgps and extensions to the cgps ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gibson et al . 2006 ) ) .",
    "this plot includes co contours and a curve marking the maximum velocity departure from circular rotation predicted by @xcite for the perseus spiral shock .",
    "apart from some irregular ism structure roberts did not model , the strong perseus hisa lies near the shock curve but at less extreme velocities , consistent with clouds lying just downstream of the spiral shock .",
    "similar but fainter shock - related hisa may be seen in the outer arm at negative velocities in the vgps data .",
    "both arms have a poor hisa - co match , as would be expected for evolving gas ; in this scenario , the visible co traces more evolved gas further downstream , where little background h  i emission is left to show the remaining cold atomic gas in the co clouds as hisa .    in the inner galaxy ,",
    "the picture is more complex .",
    "a much larger amount of hisa is seen , since even simple rotation provides near and far points on each sight line with the same velocity .",
    "this allows a much more widespread h  i emission background , which may account for the stronger hisa - co agreement and the lack of clearly - defined spiral arms .",
    "however , the latter requires a significant amount of cold interarm h  i in the disk . whether the interarm cold cloud population is related to the outer - galaxy turbulent hisa population",
    "is still under investigation .",
