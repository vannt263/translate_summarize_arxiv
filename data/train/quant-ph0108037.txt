    "quantum information processing has attracted a lot of interest in recent years , following deutsch s investigations @xcite concerning the potentiality of a quantum computer , i.e. , a computer where information is stored and processed in quantum systems .",
    "their application as quantum information carriers gives rise to outstanding possibilities , like secret communication ( quantum cryptography ) and the implementation of quantum networks and quantum algorithms that are more efficient than classical ones @xcite .",
    "many investigations concern the transmission of quantum information from one party ( usually called alice ) to another ( bob ) through a communication channel . in the most basic configuration",
    "the information is encoded in qubits .",
    "if the qubits are perfectly protected from environmental influence , bob receives them in the same state prepared by alice . in the more realistic case , however , the qubits have a nontrivial dynamics during the transmission because of their interaction with the environment @xcite . therefore , bob receives a set of distorted qubits because of the disturbing action of the channel .    up to",
    "now investigations have focused mainly on two subjects : determination of the channel capacity @xcite and reconstruction schemes for the original quantum state under the assumption that the action of the quantum channel is known @xcite . here",
    "we focus our attention on the problem that precedes , both from a logical and a practical point of view , all those schemes : the problem of determining the properties of the quantum channel .",
    "this problem has not been investigated so far , with the exception of very recent articles @xcite .",
    "the reliable transfer of quantum information requires a well known intermediate device .",
    "the knowledge of the behaviour of a channel is also essential to construct quantum codes @xcite . in particular",
    ", we consider the case when alice and bob use a finite amount @xmath0 of qubits , as this is the realistic case .",
    "we assume that alice and bob have , if ever , only a partial knowledge of the properties of the quantum channel and they want to estimate the parameters that characterize it .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ generaldescript ]",
    "we shall give the basic idea of quantum channel estimation and introduce the notation as well as the tools to quantify the quality of channel estimation protocols .",
    "we shall then continue with the problem of parametrizing quantum channels appropriately in section [ parametrization ] .",
    "then we are in a position to envisage the estimation protocol for the case of one parameter channels in section [ oneparameter ] .",
    "in particular , we shall investigate the optimal estimation protocols for the depolarizing channel , the phase damping channel and the amplitude damping channel .",
    "we shall also give the estimation scheme for an arbitrary qubit channel . in section [ qubitpauli ]",
    "we explore the use of entanglement as a powerful nonclassical resource in the context of quantum channel estimation .",
    "section [ quditpauli ] deals with higher dimensional quantum channels before we conclude in section [ conclude ] .",
    "the determination of all properties of a quantum channel is of considerable importance for any quantum communication protocol . in practice",
    "such a quantum channel can be a transmission line , the storage for a quantum system , or an uncontrolled time evolution of the underlying quantum system .",
    "the behaviour of such channels is generally not known from the beginning , so we have to find methods to gain this knowledge .",
    "this is in an exact way only possible if one has infinite resources , which means an infinite amount of well prepared quantum systems .",
    "the influence of the channel on each member of such an ensemble can then be studied , i.e. , the corresponding statistics allows us to characterize the channel . in a pratical application , however , such a condition will never be fulfilled .",
    "instead we have to come along with low numbers of available quantum systems .",
    "we therefore can not determine the action of a quantum channel perfectly , but only up to some accuracy .",
    "we therefore speak of channel estimation rather than channel determination , which would be the case for infinite resources .",
    "a quantum channel describes the evolution affecting the state of a quantum system .",
    "it can describe effects like decoherence or interaction with the environment as well as controlled or uncontrolled time evolution occuring during storage or transmission . in mathematical terms a quantum channel is a completely positive linear map @xmath1 ( cp - map ) @xcite , which transforms a density operator @xmath2 to another density operator @xmath3 each quantum channel @xmath1 can be parametrized by a vector @xmath4 with @xmath5 components . for a specific channel we shall therefore write @xmath6 throughout the paper . depending on the initial knowledge about the channel",
    ", the number of parameters differs .",
    "the goal of channel estimation is to specify the parameter vector @xmath4 .",
    "the protocol alice and bob have to follow in order to estimate the properties of a quantum channel is depicted in figure [ figurescheme ] .",
    "alice and bob agree on a set of @xmath0 quantum states @xmath7 , which are prepared by alice and then sent through the quantum channel @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , bob receives the @xmath0 states @xmath9 .",
    "he can now perform measurements on them . from the results he has to deduce an estimated vector @xmath10 which should be as close as possible to the underlying parameter vector @xmath4 of the quantum channel .",
    "quantum state @xmath11 to bob .",
    "the channel maps these states onto the states @xmath12 , on which bob can perform arbitrary measurements .",
    "note that bob s measurements are designed with the knowledge of the original quantum states @xmath11 .",
    "his final aim will be to present an estimated vector @xmath10 being as close as possible to the underlying parameter vector @xmath4.,width=302 ]    how can we quantify bob s estimation ? to answer this we introduce two errors or cost functions which describe how good the channel is estimated .",
    "the first obvious cost function is the _ statistical error",
    "_    c_s(n,)_=1^l ( _ -_^est(n))^2 [ ciesse ] in the estimation of the parameter vector @xmath4 .",
    "note that the elements of the estimated parameter vector @xmath13 strongly depend on the available resources , i.e.  the number @xmath0 of systems prepared by alice .",
    "we also emphasize that @xmath14 describes the error for one single run of an estimation protocol .",
    "however , we are not interested in the single run error ( [ ciesse ] ) but in the average error of a given protocol",
    ". therefore , we sum over all possible measurement outcomes @xmath15 to get the _ mean statistical error _ @xmath16 while keeping the number @xmath0 of resources fixed .    though this looks as a good benchmark to quantify the quality of an estimation protocol it has a major drawback .",
    "the cost function @xmath14 strongly depends on the parametrization of the quantum channel . while this is not so important if one compares different protocols using the same parametrization it anyhow would be much better if we could give a cost function which is independent of any specifications .",
    "we define such a cost function with the help of the average overlap ( c_1,c_2 ) _ [ channelfidelity ] between two quantum channels @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where we average the fidelity @xcite f(_1,_2)^2 [ mixedstatefidelity ] between two mixed states @xmath19 and @xmath20 over all possible pure quantum states @xmath21 .",
    "since the fidelity ranges from zero to one , the _ fidelity error _ is given by c_f(n,)1-f(c_,c_^est(n ) ) [ costfct_f ] which now is zero for identical quantum channels .",
    "again we average over all possible measurement outcomes to get the _",
    "mean fidelity error _ _ f(n,)c_f(n,)_j [ costfct_fav ] which quantifies the whole protocol and not a specific single run .    in the first part of this paper we are only dealing with qubits",
    "described by the density operator 12(1+s ) [ blochvector ] with bloch vector @xmath22 and the pauli matrices @xmath23 .",
    "the action of a channel is then completely described by the function s=c(s ) , [ mapbloch ] which maps the bloch vector @xmath24 to a new bloch vector @xmath25 . in particular , the mixed state fidelity equation ( [ mixedstatefidelity ] ) , for two qubits with bloch vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 , see equation ( [ blochvector ] ) , then simplifies to @xcite f(s_1,s_2)=12[fidss1 ] which leads to an average channel overlap , equation  ( [ channelfidelity ] ) , ( c_1,c_2 )  f(c_1(n),c_2(n ) ) [ fidss2 ] for the two qubit channels @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as emphasized above we only average over pure input states with unit bloch vector    @xmath28    and bloch sphere element @xmath29 . by inserting equations ( [ fidss1 ] ) and ( [ fidss2 ] ) into equations ( [ costfct_f ] ) and ( [ costfct_fav ] )",
    "we get a cost function for the comparison of two qubit channels which is independent of the chosen parametrization .",
    "as we have already mentioned in section [ generaldescript ] , the qubits that alice sends to bob are fully characterized by their bloch vector .",
    "therefore , the disturbing action of the channel modifies the initial bloch vector @xmath30 according to equation ( [ mapbloch ] ) .",
    "it has been shown that for completely positive operators the action of the quantum channel @xmath31 is given by an affine transformation @xcite    @xmath32    where @xmath33 denotes a @xmath34 invertible matrix and @xmath35 is a vector .",
    "the transformation is thus described by 12 parameters , 9 for the matrix @xmath33 and 3 for the vector @xmath35 .",
    "these 12 parameters have to fullfill some constraints to guarantee the complete positivity of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the definition of the parameters is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "we will not use the parameters as defined in @xcite , but adopt a different parametrization    @xmath37    in terms of the parameter vector @xmath38 .",
    "in general , the choice of the best parametrization of quantum channels depends on the relevant features of the channel and also on which observables can be measured .",
    "the reason for the choice of the parametrization , equation ( [ ssprime ] ) , will become clear at the end of the section [ oneparameter ] , in which a protocol for the general channel is described .",
    "although the characterization of the general quantum channel requires the determination of 12 parameters , only a smaller number of parameters must be determined in practice for a given class of quantum channels .",
    "indeed , the knowledge of the properties of the physical devices used for quantum communication gives information on some parameters and allows to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated .",
    "we shall now examine in detail some known channels described by only one parameter .",
    "the first channel we consider is the depolarizing channel .",
    "the relation ( [ eq12 ] ) between the bloch vectors @xmath30 and @xmath39 of alice s and bob s qubit , respectively , reduces to the simple form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the only parameter that describes this quantum channel .",
    "this channel is a good model when quantum information is encoded in the photon polarization that can change along the transmission fiber via random rotations of the polarization direction .",
    "if alice prepares the qubit in the pure state @xmath42 , the qubit bob receives is described by the state    @xmath43    where @xmath44 denotes the state orthogonal to @xmath45 .",
    "we note that the depolarizing channel has no preferred basis",
    ". therefore , its action is isotropic in the direction of the input state .",
    "this means that the action of the channel is described by equation ( [ dep ] ) even after changing the basis of states .",
    "bob must estimate @xmath46 , which ranges between 0 ( noiseless channel ) and 1/2 ( total depolarization ) .",
    "the estimation protocol is the following : alice prepares @xmath0 qubits in the pure state    @xmath47    which denotes spin up in the direction @xmath48 , equation ( [ enne ] ) , in terms of eigenvectors @xmath49 and @xmath50 of @xmath51 .",
    "the state @xmath52 is sent to bob through the channel .",
    "bob knows the direction @xmath48 and measures the spin of the qubit he receives along @xmath48 .",
    "the outcome probabilities are    @xmath53    since alice sends a finite number of qubits , bob can only determine frequencies of measurements instead of probabilities .",
    "after bob has measured @xmath54 qubits with spin down and the remaining @xmath55 with spin up , his estimate of @xmath46 is @xmath56 .",
    "note that in a single run of the probabilistic estimation method we can get results @xmath57 , which is outside the range of the depolarizing channel . however , for the calculation of the average errors we do not have to take that into account . the cost function @xmath58 , equation ( [ ciesse ] ) , is thus    @xmath59    the average error is easily obtained when one considers that bob s frequencies of measurements occur according to a binomial probability distribution , since each of the @xmath60 measurements of spin down occurs with probability @xmath46 and each of the spin up measurements occurs with probability @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the mean statistical error reads    @xmath62    this function , shown in figure [ depolarizingfigure ] a ) , scales with the available finite resources @xmath0 .",
    "it vanishes when the channel faithfully preserves the polarization , @xmath63 .",
    "the largest average error occurs for @xmath64 , when the two actions of preserving and changing the polarization have the same probability to occur",

    "a given quality @xmath71 or @xmath72 one can use figure [ depolarizingfigure ] and read off the number @xmath0 of needed resources .",
    "the phase - damping channel acts only on two components of the bloch vector , leaving the third one unchanged : @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the damping parameter .",
    "this channel , contrarily to the depolarizing channel , has a preferred basis . in terms of density matrices",
    ", it transforms the initial state    @xmath75    where @xmath76 , etc .",
    ", into    @xmath77    we note that here the parameter @xmath46 only appears in the off - diagonal terms . for this reason ,",
    "the phase damping channel is a good model to describe decoherence @xcite .",
    "indeed , a repeated application of this channel leads to a vanishing of the off  diagonal terms in @xmath78 , whereas its diagonal terms are preserved .    since the parameter @xmath46 of the phase damping channel appears in the off - diagonal elements of @xmath78 , the protocol is the following : alice sends @xmath0 qubits with the bloch vector in the @xmath79 plane ; for instance , qubits in the state @xmath80 can be used .",
    "this would correspond to a density operator whose matrix elements are all equal to 1/2 , can be used .",

    "for the amplitude damping channel there is also a second local maximum for large values of @xmath46 .",
    "we now come to the problem of estimating the 12 parameters @xmath100 of the general quantum channel .",

    "however , we do not give the expression here as it gives no particular further insight .",
    "up to now we have only considered estimation methods based on measuring single qubits sent through the quantum channel .",
    "however , we are not restricted to these estimation schemes . instead of sending single qubits we could use entangled qubit pairs @xcite . in this section",
    "we will demonstrate the superiority of such entanglement - based estimation methods for the estimation of the so called pauli channel by comparing both schemes ( for a different use of entanglement as a powerful resource when using pauli channels , see @xcite ) .",
    "the pauli channel is widely discussed in the literature , especially in the context of quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "its name originates from the error operators of the channel .",
    "these error operators are the pauli spin matrices @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath51 . the operators define the quantum mechanical analogue to bit errors in a classical communication channel since @xmath104 causes a bit flip ( @xmath106 transforms into @xmath107 and vice versa ) , @xmath51 causes a phase flip ( @xmath108 transforms into @xmath109 ) and @xmath105 results in a combined bit and phase flip . the pauli channel is described by three probabilities @xmath110 for the occurrence of the three errors . if an initial quantum state @xmath2 is sent through the channel , the pauli channel transforms @xmath2 into @xmath111 thus we see that the density operator @xmath2 remains unchanged with probability @xmath112 , whereas with probability @xmath113 the qubit undergoes a bit flip , with probability @xmath114 there occurs a phase flip , and with probability @xmath115 both a bit flip and a phase flip take place",
    ".      we will first describe the single qubit estimation scheme for the pauli channel , before we switch to the entanglement - based one in the next subsection .",
    "following the general estimation scheme presented in section [ generaldescript ] the protocol to estimate the parameters of the pauli channel , equation ( [ pau ] ) , requires the preparation of three different quantum states with spin along three orthogonal directions .",

    "bob measures their spins along the direction of spin - preparation , namely the @xmath95 , @xmath82 , and @xmath101 axes , respectively .",

    ", the average error vanishes when faithful transmission or one of the errors occurs with certainty .",
    "instead of using the statistical cost function @xmath14 we can also use the fidelity based cost function @xmath129 ( [ costfct_f ] ) . the average error @xmath130 of the estimation via separable qubits is then given by @xmath131 the cost function @xmath129 can not be calculated analytically .",

    "in the previous section we have proposed an entanglement  based method for estimating the parameters which define the pauli channel . as we shall show in this section , this method can be easily extended to the case of quantum channels defined on higher dimensional hilbert spaces .",

    "for sake of simplicity we assume that the two subsystems are @xmath158level systems .",
    "if only the second particle is affected by the quantum channel , equation ( [ general quantum channel ] ) , then the final state is given by    @xmath159    where @xmath160 is the identity operator .",

    "however , these states can be perfectly distinguished if and only if they are mutually orthogonal .",
    "hence , we impose the condition    @xmath168    on the initial state @xmath169 .",
    "it means that the initial state @xmath169 of the bipartite quantum system should be chosen in such a way that it is mapped onto a set of mutually orthogonal states @xmath170 by the error operators @xmath157 .",
    "it is worth to remark the close analogy between this estimation strategy and quantum error correction .",
    "a non - degenerate quantum error correcting code @xcite corresponds to a hilbert subspace which is mapped onto mutually orthogonal subspaces under the action of the error operators . in this sense ,",
    "a state @xmath169 satisfying the condition ( [ condition ] ) is a one - dimensional non - degenerated error correcting code .    a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of a state @xmath171 satisfying equation([condition ] ) is given by the inequality    @xmath172    where @xmath173 is the total number of error operators which describe the quantum channel and @xmath174 is the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "this inequality shows why the use of an entangled pair enhances the estimation scheme .",
    "although the first particle is not affected by the action of the noisy quantum channel , it enlarges the dimension of the total hilbert space in such a way that the condition ( [ condition ] ) can be fulfilled .",
    "it is also clear from this inequality that if the state @xmath175 is a separable one , a set of orthogonal states can only be designed in principle if the number of error operators @xmath173 is smaller than @xmath174 .",
    "for instance , in the case of the pauli channel for qubits considered in the previous section , condition ( [ bound ] ) does not hold if we use single qubits for the estimation .",
    "the action of the pauli channel is defined by a set of @xmath176 error operators ( including the identity ) acting onto qubits ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "let us now apply our consideration to the case of a generalized pauli channel .",
    "the action of this channel is given by    @xmath178    where the @xmath179 kraus operators @xmath180 are defined by    @xmath181    the operation    @xmath182    is the generalization of a phase flip in @xmath158 dimensions .",
    "the @xmath158dimensional bit flip is given by @xmath183    these errors occur with probabilities @xmath184 , which are normalized , @xmath185 . the states @xmath186 form a @xmath158-dimensional basis of the hilbert space of the quantum system .",
    "this extension of the pauli channel to higher dimensional hilbert spaces has been studied previously in the context of quantum error correction @xcite , quantum cloning machines @xcite and entanglement @xcite .",
    "now we will apply the estimation strategy based on condition ( [ condition ] ) to this particular channel .",
    "thus , we must look for a state of the bipartite quantum system which satisfies the set of conditions ( [ condition ] ) , for the error operators @xmath180 , i.e.    @xmath187    it can be easily shown that such a state is    @xmath188    where @xmath189 and @xmath190 , @xmath191 , are basis states for the two particles .",
    "in fact , the action of the operators @xmath192 onto state @xmath193 generates the basis    latexmath:[\\[|\\psi_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\rangle\\equiv   { \\bf 1}\\otimes u_{\\alpha,\\beta}|\\psi_{0,0}\\rangle= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{k=0}^{d-1}e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{d}\\alpha k }     of @xmath179 maximally entangled states for the total hilbert space .",
    "thereby , the action of the generalized pauli channel yields    @xmath195 .",
    "the particular values of the coefficients @xmath184 can now be obtained by projecting onto the states @xmath196 . the quality of this estimation strategy according to the statistical error",
    "is given by    @xmath197    with @xmath133 the number of pairs of quantum systems used in the estimation .",
    "we have examined the problem of determining the parameters that describe a noisy quantum channel with finite resources .",
    "we have given simple protocols for the determination of the parameters of several classes of quantum channels .",
    "these protocols are based on measurements made on qubits that are sent through the channel .",
    "we have also introduced two cost functions that estimate the quality of the protocols . in the most simple protocols measurements",
    "are performed on each qubit .",
    "we have also shown that more complex schemes based on entangled pairs can give a better estimate of the parameters of the pauli channel .",
    "our investigations stress once more the usefulness of entanglement in quantum information .",
    "we acknowledge support by the dfg programme `` quanten - informationsverarbeitung '' , by the european science foundation qit programme and by the programmes `` qubits '' and `` quest '' of the european commission .",
