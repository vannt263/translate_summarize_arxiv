    "both grand unified theories ( gut ) @xcite and brane world scenario with extra dimensions , though neither are observed in nature yet , have fascinated us very much @xcite .",
    "so far , they have been developed mostly as independent paradigms .    in this work ,",
    "we provide a framework in which gut and the brane world scenario inseparably cooperate in extending standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a rich vacuum structure of gut , especially in supersymmetric theories , often gives a number of discrete vacua which can form domain walls . in @xmath4 dimensional spacetime , domain walls can provide spontaneous generation of our @xmath1 dimensional world @xcite .",
    "there have been a few works @xcite combining gut and extra dimensions by considering a domain wall in which all gut particles are trapped .",
    "in contrast , we aim at _ unifying _ them in such a way that the breaking pattern of gut gauge symmetry and profile of massless sm particles ( one - generation of quarks and leptons ) are determined as a consequence of wall dynamics .",
    "while domain wall solutions often have unwanted flat directions associated to moduli , our model stabilizes them with mass @xmath3 .",
    "we overcome the long - standing problem of localizing gauge fields on the domain wall @xcite by adopting field - dependent gauge kinetic term @xcite .",
    "this localization mechanism assures charge universality of matter fields by preserving the @xmath1-dimensional gauge invariance .",
    "the proton decay can be highly suppressed .",
    "we extend the minimal @xmath0 gut in @xmath1 dimensions to @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "in addition to fermionic matters @xmath5 in an anti - fundamental representation and @xmath6 in an anti - symmetric representation , we have two scalar fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 which are 5 by 5 matrices . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are in the adjoint representation while @xmath11 and @xmath12 are singlets . the minimal gut in @xmath1 dimensions",

    "the fermion masses are @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we assume all these masses to be the same order or larger than @xmath3 .",
    "since all the vacua are degenerate , static and stable domain walls exist .",
    "we choose the @xmath0 unbroken vacua as the boundary condition @xmath46 , @xmath47 at @xmath48 , and assume @xmath49 .",
    "then we find exact domain walls solutions @xmath50 with a @xmath51 hermitian matrix @xmath52 containing all the parameters i.e. moduli of the solution . without loss of generality , we can diagonalize @xmath52 . depending on the number of coincident walls and the ordering of their positions on @xmath53 , we find ten qualitatively different patterns .",
    "phenomenologically most interesting one is the 3 - 2 splitting configuration with @xmath54 , where three walls are located at @xmath55 and the remaining two are at @xmath56 , interpolating the left - most vacuum @xmath57 , the middle @xmath40 , and the right - most vacuum @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath0 is broken to @xmath59 in the middle @xmath40 vacuum .    to identify the four dimensional effective fields and their spectra around this configuration ,",

    "[ fig : wall_sol ] , where we observe that quarks and leptons are localized around the walls associated to the gauge fields with which they interact .",
    "maintaining charge universality has been difficult for localized gauge fields @xcite . in our model , it holds since the sm gauge symmetry is fully maintained . in other words ,",
    "the overlap integrals with the sm gauge fields and quarks ( leptons ) are independent of wall positions , since mode functions of massless gauge fields are flat @xmath80 .",
    "the massive gauge boson @xmath175 with mass @xmath176 plays the same role as @xmath177 gauge bosons in the usual @xmath1 dimensional gut , where its exchange is suppressed by the large mass @xmath3 .",
    "when the symmetry breaking occurs by the wall splitting , however , their coupling to quarks and leptons can have significant additional suppression .",
    "this suppression results from the small overlap of mode functions caused by two factors : the quark and lepton mode functions can be displaced from each other @xcite , and their mode functions are sharply peaked when their yukawa couplings are large .",
    "the relevant triple couplings for the proton decay can be found in the kinetic terms of @xmath128 as _ pd & = & g h_lq1 |d^c^^(0)*_l + g h_dq _ 3 + & + &   g h_lq2 _ 2 + . here , we use a canonical notation by redefining @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 .",

    "zz = h_z h_z g^2 / _ 0 ^ 2 .",
    "the suppression factor @xmath190 compared to the standard gut is calculable in our model , since the mode function @xmath191 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wall_sol ] , is reliably obtained unlike in the previous model @xcite based on an ambitious assumption of nonperturbative confinement in @xmath4 dimensions . on top of being a function of separation of walls @xmath98 , @xmath190 also depends strongly on the magnitude of yukawa couplings @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the width of the mode function is inversely proportional to yukawa couplings @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "hence the large yukwa coupling suppresses the overlap exponentially @xmath192 .",
    "we plot @xmath193 and @xmath186 in fig .",
    "[ fig : proton_decay ] , where we see that they are suppressed by more than @xmath194 and @xmath195 , respectively , with the yukawa coupling of order @xmath196 .",
    "we note that there is no conflict with experimental data for these large yukawa couplings .",
    "finally let us consider the baryon number violating process mediated by the off - diagonal component @xmath64 of scalar field @xmath41 through the yukawa couplings .",
    "although it is difficult to solve the schrdinger problem for @xmath64 @xcite , it is still possible to get qualitative features .",
    "since the zero modes of @xmath64 are absorbed by @xmath68 , the lightest mode of @xmath64 should have mass of order @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , since the potential of the schrdinger problem should make the mode functions localized around the walls , similarly to zero mode case , the overlaps of mode functions are suppressed similarly to the vector case .",
    "hence we expect that @xmath41-mediated proton decay enjoys a suppression factor of the same order as that of the massive vector bosons .",
    "we propose a @xmath4 dimensional model which unifies @xmath0 gut and the brane world scenario .",
    "our @xmath1 dimensional spacetime dynamically emerges with the symmetry breaking @xmath197 together with one generation of the sm matter fields .",
    "we solve the gradient flow equation and confirm the 3 - 2 splitting configuration is the global minimum in a large parameter region . by applying the idea of the field - dependent gauge kinetic function @xcite to our model , we solve the long - standing difficulties of the localization of massless gauge fields and charge universality .",
    "all the undesirable moduli are stabilized .",
    "furthermore , the proton decay can be exponentially suppressed .",
    "we have not yet included the sm higgs field and the second and higher generations , but our framework can easily incorporate the former similarly to ref.@xcite and the latter with the mass hierarchy in the spirit of ref.@xcite . furthermore , our model can be extended to other gut gauge group like @xmath198 .",
    "supersymmetry and/or warped spacetime with gravity can also be included without serious difficulties .",
    "since our model has strong resemblance to d - branes in superstring theory , we hope that our field theoretical model can give some hints for simple constructions of sm by d - branes .",
