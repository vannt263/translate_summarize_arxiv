    "in the following , we consider the optimization of a state - to - state transfer problem where the figure of merit is the overlap of the final state after the evolution with the target state @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the target state and the time evolution is given by the schrdinger equation @xmath4 and control function @xmath5 is determined by the optimization algorithm in order to maximize the figure of merit .",
    "the crab algorithm  @xcite builds on the fact that in most scenarios the resources available to solve an optimal control problem  such as time , energy and bandwidth  are limited : in particular , as the set of practically accessible wave functions is usually limited , one can show that also the control bandwidth of the control field can be upper bounded  @xcite .",
    "this bound has very important consequences as optimal control problems can be practically solved by exploring a small subset of the a priori infinite dimensional search space of functions .",
    "that is , one can expand the control field in a truncated basis @xmath6 and the optimization can then be performed on this subspace of _ small _ dimension , resulting in an optimal set of coefficients @xmath7 .",
    "the optimization can be performed by standard tools , e.g. by the nelder - mead simplex algorithm that does not rely on gradients  @xcite . a standard choice for the basis functions @xmath8 are trigonometric functions , often multiplied by a shape function @xmath9 that fixes the pulse boundary conditions and a guess pulse  @xcite .    due to the restriction of the search basis to @xmath10 dimensions given by the crab expansion in eq .",
    ", the algorithm might converge to a non - optimal fixed point , i.e. the algorithm is trapped in a local minimum arising due to the constraint - a so - called false trap . to overcome this problem , and escape from these false traps , we show in the next section that one can start from the non - optimal fixed point a new crab optimization with a new random basis and new coefficients .",
    "this is done in an iterative way so that in the @xmath11-th super - iteration one optimizes the coefficients @xmath12 of @xmath13 where @xmath14 are new randomly chosen basis functions , for example sine or cosine functions with random frequencies within some interval @xmath15 $ ] . as a consequence , in each super - iteration the old pulse is dressed with new search directions and we call this procedure dressed chopped random basis ( dcrab ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this updating of the search directions can also be understood as an extension of powell s method @xcite to an infinite dimensional search space . in the following sections we give a theoretical explanation why this is a substantial improvement of the algorithm by analyzing how it influences the constrained control landscape and we demonstrate it numerically by applying it to a model with typical properties .    .",
    "while @xmath16 has a strict global maximum point at @xmath3 ( left panel ) , this state can be reached by different control functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 corresponding to multiple global maximum points in the landscape @xmath19 ( right panel).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this and in the following section , we review the theory of control landscapes and how it can enlighten the reasons why optimal control algorithms converge to the optimal solution or become trapped  @xcite .",
    "we first review a general perturbative analyses of control landscapes presented in @xcite , specifically its gradients and critical points , valid independently from the particular optimization algorithm employed to find the optimal driving field ; and then we specify it to the crab approach we are focusing here . in particular , we focus on why crab can be trapped whereas dcrab  like gradient methods  can not be trapped , as we will show also in the next section by means of some numerical examples .    given a control problem with control @xmath5 , the control landscape is the functional @xmath20 with @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the final state resulting from time evolution of the initial state @xmath23 with the given control @xmath5 and @xmath16 is a figure of merit quantifying the quality of the process  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the control landscape is the functional expressing the figure of merit of the process as a function of the control field . in the following we use the state fidelity given by eq .   as a figure of merit .",
    "notice that the control landscape can be seen either as a function of the final state @xmath24 or as a functional of the control field @xmath5 : in the first case the function has by definition a single optimal point ( @xmath25 , up to a global phase ) , while in the latter there might exist different control pulses leading to the same maximum value , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : landscape ] .",
    "optimization usually leads to so - called critical points of the landscape , that is to pulse shapes fulfilling the condition @xmath26 i.e. a vanishing variation of the functional @xmath19 for a variation of the control @xmath27 . using the chain rule one can show that this variation consists of two parts : the gradient of the fidelity as a function of the final state @xmath28 , and the variation of the final state as a result of the variation of the control @xmath29 .",
    "for all common choices of the figure of merit a vanishing gradient @xmath30 corresponds to the global maximum , global minimum or a saddle point  @xcite ; more specifically if @xmath31 is the state overlap ( eq . )",
    "there are no saddle points since @xmath32 corresponds to @xmath33 ( the global minimum ) or @xmath34 ( the global maximum ) .",
    "less intuitive is the role played by the second term , which we analyze in the following , to understand under which conditions @xmath35 implies @xmath30 .",
    "critical points can be classified as singular or regular critical points , where regular means that for every @xmath36 in the hilbert space of the problem there is a change in the control @xmath37 that generates it , while on the contrary for singular points this is not the case  @xcite . as a direct consequence , for regular critical points we have @xmath38 as in this case",
    "the gradient of the fidelity is orthogonal to the whole hilbert space .",
    "this means that a regular point is not a trap .",
    "that is , all traps have to be singular critical points ( although the reverse is not necessarily true ) .",
    "however , at least for controllable systems , all known traps occur at constant control fields  @xcite , often at @xmath39 , and numerical evidence hints to the fact that the singular points at non - constant control seem to be no traps  @xcite . that is , it is commonly accepted that unconstrained control landscapes for all practical purposes have no traps , although a rigorous proof has been given only for two specific situations , the landau - zener system @xcite and the transmission of a wave package over a potential barrier @xcite .",
    "now we discuss the implications of these results on the crab and dcrab optimal control success rate . as a starting point , we recall that the previous statements assume that the control @xmath27 is a general function in @xmath40 whereas for crab we are much more restricted by the expansion into the truncated basis .",
    "this means that one might find false traps in the crab control landscape , i.e. encounter points where @xmath41 vanishes for all variations @xmath37 allowed by the truncated basis expansion of eq .  , but",
    "not for all variations of the unconstrained control space : @xmath42 these points are called false traps  @xcite as they arise only artificially from the choice of the basis and their influence can hinder convergence of the algorithm  @xcite .    here ,",
    "we show how these false traps for crab are removed by the super - iterations of dcrab : from equations ( [ eq : criticalpoint - chainrule ] ) and ( [ eq : pseudocriticalpoint ] ) together with @xmath43 it follows that , for a false trap the gradient has to be @xmath44 for some non - zero vector @xmath45 .",
    "a perturbative treatment yields  @xcite : @xmath46 this results in the expression for the overlap of the state update and the gradient @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a continuous function and @xmath49 since @xmath50 would violate eq .",
    "( [ eq : pseudocriticalpoint ] ) .",
    "if we now choose @xmath51 with a new random frequency @xmath52 we get @xmath53 almost surely ( i.e. the integral vanishes only on a null set of the probability measure ) .",
    "if we now perturb our control field @xmath27 by this new frequency contribution ( this is the new super - iteration of dcrab ) we find @xmath54 and thus we have removed the false trap . in conclusion ,",
    "the recipe to escape from a false trap is simply to add a new random frequency term to the crab expansion once we are in the false trap .",
    "this can be done also without increasing the total number of coefficients since when one is at the bottom of a false trap for a given set of basis functions and coefficients there is no more use in varying the old coefficients , and they can be kept at their value .",
    "we thus use the pulse @xmath27 leading to the false trap as a guess pulse for the next super - iteration of dcrab ( as explained in the previous section , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : dcrab ] ) ) that opens the false trap .",
    "in this section we show that by choosing enough new frequencies in a single super - iteration of dcrab we can follow approximately the instantaneous gradient of the control landscape with a bandwidth - limited pulse update . in the previous section we chose a new basis function so that its scalar product with @xmath55 would be finite .",
    "it is worth noting that this function @xmath56 is exactly the update direction used in gradient algorithms with the time - evolved initial state @xmath57 and the adjoint state @xmath58 together with @xmath59 we get the well - known @xmath60    to follow the gradient of the control landscape only a limited freedom for the pulse update is needed .",
    "hsieh et al .",
    "@xcite derived for a state to state transfer in an @xmath0-level system a set of @xmath61 functions ( for each iteration step ) that span the pulse update @xmath56 .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that the state update generated by the pulse update @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath36 , is a @xmath0 dimensional complex vector ( @xmath62 real coefficients ) with norm @xmath63 and irrelevant global phase ( thus @xmath61 real coefficients ) .",
    "we can generate something very similar by choosing @xmath64 random frequencies ( we do not fix the global phase here ) and corresponding pulse updates @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) with real coefficients @xmath67 .",
    "let us here assume that @xmath40 pulses can generate @xmath36 out of the whole tangential space of the unity sphere of @xmath68 ( i.e. regularity of the control landscape at the point of consideration which is the general case for trap free landscapes ) .",
    "the state update generated by each pulse update in a perturbative regime reads  @xcite : @xmath69    we now show that for every vector @xmath70 out of this unit sphere there is a set of real coefficients @xmath71 so that @xmath72 . in order to do",
    "so we identify @xmath73 and @xmath74 as elements of a @xmath64 dimensional real vector space with scalar product @xmath75 and show that the @xmath74 are a basis of this space .",
    "let us thus consider @xmath76 .",
    "we will show by induction that @xmath77 has dimension @xmath78 . for @xmath79",
    "this is trivial .",
    "if now @xmath77 has dimension @xmath78 we have to show that @xmath80 is not orthogonal to @xmath81 .",
    "let thus be @xmath82 .",
    "the overlap of @xmath80 and @xmath83 is @xmath84 the kernel @xmath85 is continuous and if @xmath86 the overlap is nonzero almost surely .",
    "however , @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) @xcite and thus @xmath83 is not in the tangential space .",
    "this proves that the @xmath74 as span the whole @xmath64 dimensional real vector space , or in other words the @xmath74 with real coefficients span the whole tangential space of the unit sphere of @xmath68 ( almost surely ) .",
    "we can also orthogonalize the state updates in a gram schmidt way to obtain the orthogonal basis @xmath91 .",
    "this translates into a change of the pulse updates via @xmath92 with @xmath93 generated by @xmath94 .",
    "each direction @xmath95 is then a linear superposition of the basis states @xmath96 and can thus be generated by a superposition of the corresponding pulses @xmath97 in particular this proves that with @xmath64 random instantaneous basis functions ( @xmath98 oder @xmath94 for the `` orthogonal '' basis ) we can follow the instantaneous gradient of the control landscape by suitable coefficients . we stress that , unlike in the case of a standard gradient method , this is done by bandwidth - limited pulses which can be comfortably adapted to typical experimental constraints such as bandwidth - limited control electronics .",
    "this result demonstrates that after a change of the truncated basis in the function space the search in the state space is quasi - local .",
    "we can use this in the numerical part by initializing a small simplex after the basis change to ensure local search .",
    "the orthogonalization procedure could also help to find a better basis for the crab ( re)start at the cost of @xmath99 additional function evaluations .",
    "in this section we show that the dcrab algorithm is indeed capable of escaping from false traps in random optimal control problems of increasing complexity .",

    "the three regimes are shifted toward larger frequencies .",

    "thanks to this theoretical result , we have modified the crab optimization algorithm to efficiently combine the advantages of gradient methods with those of truncated basis methods .",
    "we showed that it is possible to exploit both the guaranteed convergence to the global optimum that gradient algorithms exhibit in the frequent case in which the kinematic ( @xmath31 ) and the dynamical ( @xmath20 ) landscapes are equivalent and the numerical gradient - free truncated basis approach .",
    "moreover , we showed for two typical constraints , namely the limited fluence and the limited bandwidth constraints below the theoretical bound , that some of the convergence properties survive , if the constraints are carefully implemented in the optimization procedure .",
    "we expect that the presented results will allow to tackle in the near future both theoretically and experimentally even more complex many - body problems as done so far , as well as a broader variety of control objectives and constraints .",

    "<S> in quantum optimal control theory the success of an optimization algorithm is highly influenced by how the figure of merit to be optimized behaves as a function of the control field , i.e. by the control landscape . </S>",
    "<S> constraints on the control field introduce local minima in the landscape false traps which might prevent an efficient solution of the optimal control problem . </S>",
    "<S> rabitz et al . </S>",
    "<S> [ science 303 , 1998 ( 2004 ) ] showed that local minima occur only rarely for unconstrained optimization . here , we extend this result to the case of bandwidth - limited control pulses showing that in this case one can eliminate the false traps arising from the constraint . </S>",
    "<S> based on this theoretical understanding , we modify the chopped random basis ( crab ) optimal control algorithm and show that this development exploits the advantages of both ( unconstrained ) gradient algorithms and of truncated basis methods , allowing to always follow the gradient of the unconstrained landscape by bandwidth - limited control functions . </S>",
    "<S> we study the effects of additional constraints and show that for reasonable constraints the convergence properties are still maintained . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we numerically show that this approach saturates the theoretical bound on the minimal bandwidth of the control needed to optimally drive the system .    </S>",
    "<S> the ability of achieving a desired transformation of a quantum system lies at the heart of the success of experiments in cold atoms  @xcite , quantum optics  @xcite , condensed matter  @xcite , and in quantum technologies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> together with the fast development of these fields and the increasing complexity of the experiments , to develop efficient protocols it is often necessary to automatize the optimization process if not the whole development of the experimental sequence  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one possible way to perform such an optimization is by means of quantum optimal control , an approach that has proven to be very successful in solving this class of problems  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the success of gradient methods to find global solutions in quantum control problems  @xcite is largely due to the fact that local minima are very rare in the control landscapes of a large class of systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , to face the new challenges posed by the recent advancements in quantum science , gradient methods might be not the best option since to numerically calculate the gradient of the control objective might be quite inefficient . moreover in an increasing number of interesting applications , the control objective does not allow for an analytical calculation of the gradient  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the crab optimal control algorithm operates with an expansion of the control field onto a truncated basis and a direct optimization of the coefficients of the expansion by means of gradient - free minimization  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these characteristics allow for the solution of optimal control problems involving many - body quantum systems  @xcite , as well as in the presence of long - range interactions  @xcite , bandwidth - limited control according to experimental constraints  @xcite , and highly nonlinear functionals where the gradient can not be calculated  @xcite . however , the crab optimization does not necessarily fulfill the condition under which local minima in the optimization occur only rarely as it is by construction bandwidth - limited  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we extend the results presented by rabitz and coworkers  @xcite and show that bandwidth - limited optimal control can be made virtually free of local minima as in the case of unconstrained control . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we numerically show that the global minima one always reaches correspond to an optimal solution if the bandwidth satisfy the theoretical bound given in reference  @xcite . in particular , we present an extension of the crab algorithm  the `` dressed crab '' ( dcrab )  that keeps the benefits of the original algorithm and comes with the additional property of guaranteed convergence to the global optimum in the cases where this is guaranteed also for gradient methods . </S>",
    "<S> we test the two versions of the algorithm by optimizing a state transfer for different instances of a random spin hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> being @xmath0 the dimension of the hilbert space the problem is defined on , for the standard crab algorithm false traps occur when the heuristic `` @xmath1-rule '' for the number of required control coefficients is violated  @xcite . on the contrary , using the dcrab presented hereafter , all false traps are removed regardless of the number of control coefficients , resulting also in a faster convergence to the global optimum . </S>",
    "<S> we present a theoretical explanation supporting these findings and showing that one can construct a set of random basis functions which follow the instantaneous gradient of the control landscape . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we examine the behavior of dcrab in the presence of additional constraints on the bandwidth and amplitude of the pulse , and show that the algorithm is well - behaving as false traps appear only in the presence of strong constraints . in the following , for simplicity we will focus on state to state transfer of pure states , however the theoretical arguments are valid in the general scenario of unitary gate generation and mixed - states optimal control .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure of this paper is as follows : we first review the standard crab algorithm and introduce its extension , dcrab  @xcite . in section </S>",
    "<S> ii we present the theoretical basis of dcrab , while in section iii we show that dcrab follows the instantaneous gradient of the landscape . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in section iv we apply both crab and dcrab to control problems with random spin hamiltonians and evaluate their performance with respect to success probability , computational effort and behavior under constraints . </S>"
