    "the realization of bcs  bose - einstein condentate ( bec ) evolution with two - component atomic fermi gases has received tremendous attention in the last decade  @xcite . in these experiments",
    ", the tuning of attractive interactions permits the ground state of the system to evolve from a weak fermion attraction bcs limit of loosely bound and largely overlapping cooper pairs to a strong fermion attraction limit of tightly bound small bosonic molecules which undergo bec .",
    "the main difference between the bcs - bec evolution problem and the simple bcs theory is that the cooper pairing is not allowed only for fermions with energies close to the fermi energy but is also allowed for all momenta .",
    "all of the early theoretical works were concentrated on the balanced fermi gases , i.e. both components have the same number and mass , suggesting that the evolution is not a phase transition but a smooth crossover , and hence the name _ bcs - bec crossover_. this prediction was then found to be in very good agreement with all of the observations  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the experimental success with balanced fermi gases , many of the recent theoretical works were concentrated on imbalanced ( population , mass and/or dimension ) fermi gases , suggesting various phases and phase transitions between them .",
    "some of these predictions were also confirmed by the following experiments  @xcite , opening the door for new studies on more complicated systems with the hope of finding exotic phases of matter .",
    "arguably , one of the very promising new systems to investigate is the spin - orbit coupled ( soc ) atomic fermi gases  @xcite .",
    "this is mainly motivated by the very recent success in realizing soc atomic bec  @xcite , and by a practical proposal for generating a soc fermi gas with @xmath0k atoms  @xcite .",
    "some of the very recent results on these systems can be summarized as follows .",
    "for the two - body problem , it has been found that a two - body bound state exists for some types of soc , e.g. rashba or dresselhaus types , even on the bcs side ( @xmath1 ) of a resonance  @xcite with arbitrarily small @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the @xmath4-wave scattering length .",
    "for the many - body problem , it has been found for balanced fermi gases that the soc increases the single - particle density of states , which in return favors the cooper pairing so significantly that increasing the soc , while @xmath3 is held fixed , eventually induces a bcs - bec evolution even for a weakly - interacting system when @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "similar to what happens in the usual bcs - bec crossover picture of a balanced fermi gas with increasing @xmath5 , the bcs - bec evolution with increasing soc turns out to be a smooth crossover but not a phase transition .",
    "therefore , the ground state of balanced fermi gases with or without the soc is a topologically trivial gapped superfluid .",
    "however , the bcs - bec evolution with rashba - type soc is found to become a phase transition for population-  @xcite and/or mass - imbalanced  @xcite fermi gases .",
    "it has been found that the soc counteracts the population imbalance , and that this competition tends to stabilize the uniform topologically nontrivial gapless superfluid phases against the phase separation .",
    "in addition , topological phase transitions associated with the appearance of momentum space regions with zero quasiparticle / quasihole energies have been found , the signatures of which could be observed in the momentum distribution or the single - particle spectral function  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic ( in momentum space ) nature of the soc is also found to stabilize exotic superfluid phases .",
    "for instance , in sharp contrast to the no - soc case where only the gapless superfluid phase supports population imbalance , both the gapless and gapped superfluid phases are found to support population imbalance in the presence of a rashba - type soc  @xcite .",
    "similarly , again in sharp contrast to the no - soc case where only the gapped superfluid phase supports population balance , both the gapped and gapless superfluid phases are found to support population balance in mass - imbalanced soc fermi gases when the mass difference becomes large enough  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we extend our recent works  @xcite , and study the effects of anisotropic soc on the phase diagrams of both balanced and imbalanced fermi gases throughout the entire bcs - bec evolution .",
    "we analyze both zero and finite temperature phase diagrams , and the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we review the noninteracting and interacting two - body problem in sec .",
    "[ sec : tbp ] , and calculate the binding energy of the two - body bound - state in vacuum .",

    "in the case of prd - type soc , a two - body bound state exists even for @xmath1  @xcite , and its energy is determined by  @xcite @xmath40 in the weak soc limit , when @xmath41 , this expression gives @xmath42 up to the leading order in @xmath43 , and it recovers the usual result in the @xmath44 limit . however , in the strong soc limit , when @xmath45 , eq .",

    "adding the interactions does not effect this picture much  @xcite , and the crossover in the fermi surface topology again occurs at @xmath64 .",

    "hoping that the mean - field formalism remains sufficient in the presence of a soc , here we analyze the resultant ground - state phase diagrams .    for this purpose",

    "we showed that while both the erd- and fa - type soc do not have any observable effect on the balanced fermi gases , only the fa - type soc does not have any effect on the population - imbalanced gases . on the other hand",
    ", in the case of erd- and prd - type soc , we found that the competition between the population imbalance and the soc gives rise to very rich phase diagrams , involving normal , superfluid and phase separated regions , and quantum phase transitions between the topologically trivial gapped superfluid and the nontrivial gapless superfluid phases .",
    "for instance , one of the intriguing effects of the soc is that , in sharp contrast to the no - soc case where only the gapless superfluid phase supports population imbalance , both the gapless and gapped superfluid phases can support population imbalance in the presence of a soc .",
    "we also showed that the topological structure of the ground - state phase diagrams is quite robust against the effects of anisotropy , i.e. they are very similar for erd- and prd - type soc .",
    "in the second part , we went beyond the mean - field description , and investigated the effects of gaussian fluctuations near the critical temperature .",
    "this allowed us to derive the time - dependent ginzburg - landau theory , from which we extracted the effective mass of the cooper pairs and their critical condensation temperature @xmath272 in the molecular bec limit .",
    "we showed that while the effective mass ( @xmath272 ) of the bosons does not depend on @xmath43 for the erd- and fa - type soc , it decreases ( increases ) monotonically as a function of increasing @xmath262 for the prd- and fs - type soc .",
    "we found @xmath293 for the prd- and @xmath294 for the fs - type soc in the weakly - interacting @xmath2 limit , and @xmath295 for both types at unitarity when @xmath296 .",
