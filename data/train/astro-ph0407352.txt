    "in its first year , the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) discovered that a majority of all baryons in the current universe are not in galaxies , but instead remain in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . in subsequent years , the uv spectrographs aboard hst and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) have continued these investigations of the multiphase igm , using sensitive uv tracers of diffuse gas : the lyman series of h  i (  at 1215.67   ,  at 1025.72   , etc ) and the o  vi doublet ( 1031.926 , 1037.617   ) .",
    "these hst and fuse studies have led to a preliminary `` baryon census '' of the `` warm '' ( photoionized ) and `` warm - hot '' ( collisionally ionized ) igm .",
    "with spectrographs aboard the _ chandra _ and _ xmm / newton _ x - ray telescopes , astronomers are beginning to search for even more highly ionized gas through resonance absorption lines of o  vii , o  viii , n  vii , and ne  ix .    unlike virtually all other astronomical objects",
    ", the ly@xmath16 absorption systems were first discovered at great distances ( @xmath17 ) owing to their cosmological redshifts and the near - uv atmospheric cutoff . only with the advent of hst",
    "have nearby examples been found .",
    "the first low-@xmath15  absorbers were seen in the spectrum of 3c  273 at @xmath18 ( bahcall et  al .",
    "1991 ; morris et  al .",
    "while the number of absorbers was significantly less than the line density at high-@xmath15 , the `` local  forest '' contains far more absorbers than expected from extrapolating the ground - based data ( bahcall 1993 and subsequent qso absorption - line key project papers by jannuzi 1998 and weymann 1998 ) . although the  absorbers at @xmath17 are sufficiently abundant to account for nearly all the baryons ( rauch 1997 ; schaye 2001 ) , their substantial numbers at @xmath3 imply that @xmath230% of all baryons remain in these photoionized clouds locally ( penton , stocke , & shull 2000a , penton , shull , & stocke 2000b , 2004 , hereafter denoted papers i , ii , and iv ) .    numerical simulations ( fig .  1 ) of the evolving igm ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et  al .",
    "1999 , 2001 ) explain not only the general features of the   number density evolution , but also many detailed properties , including distributions in column density ( ) and doppler @xmath19-value ( papers ii and iv ; dav & tripp 2001 ; ricotti , gnedin , & shull 2000 ) , and their relationship to galaxies ( dav 1999 ; impey , petry , & flint 1999 ; penton , stocke , & shull 2002 , hereafter denoted paper iii ) .",
    "any accounting of the present - day distribution of baryons must include an accurate census of these absorbers and the associated mass , inferred from their ionized fractions , column densities , and physical extents .",
    "moderate - resolution uv spectroscopy of bright quasars , qsos , blazars , and seyfert galaxies has provided a substantial database of low-@xmath15   absorbers . at the same time , several ground - based galaxy surveys ( morris 1993 ; lanzetta 1995 ; chen 1998 ; tripp , lu , & savage 1998 ; rao & turnshek 1998 , 2000 ; impey , petry , & flint 1999 ; nestor 2002 ; bowen 2002 ; paper iii ; bowen & pettini 2003 ; stocke 2005 , hereafter denoted paper  v ) have probed the relationship between  absorbers and galaxies , filaments of galaxies , and voids .",
    "using nearby examples of the  phenomenon , these authors sought to identify the galaxy types responsible for the absorption and thus assist in interpreting the wealth of information ( number densities , metallicities , ionization states , line widths ) of  absorption systems at high-@xmath15 .",
    "these efforts have been somewhat successful , although the results in most column - density regimes remain controversial ( see conference proceedings edited by mulchaey & stocke 2002 ) .    in this review ,",
    "we describe the various hst qso absorption line surveys that have been undertaken (   2 ) , review our present knowledge of the baryon content of the igm (   3 ) , and describe the emerging , but still controversial , evidence for the relationship between the various column densities of  absorbers and galaxies (   4 ) .",
    "the last information has come largely from studying low-@xmath15 absorbers discovered with hst .",
    "we conclude (   5 ) with a brief prospectus on low-@xmath15 igm studies facilitated by the _",
    "cosmic origins spectrograph _ ( cos ) , a new instrument that may be installed on hst in the coming years .",
    "the hst with its uv spectrographs ( fos , ghrs , stis ) conducted several important surveys of the igm , which provided basic data for studying the bulk of local baryons . owing to its modest spectral resolution ( 200 - 300 ) , the",
    "_ faint object spectrograph _ ( fos ) used for the initial qso absorption - line key project ( bahcall 1993 ) primarily detected high column density  absorbers with equivalent widths @xmath20  m . the key project provided examples of the various types of  absorbers : damped  ( dla ) absorbers , lyman - limit / strong mg  ii absorbers , weak high - ionization ( c  iv ) and low - ionization ( mg  ii ) metal - line absorbers , and -only absorbers ( bahcall 1996 ; jannuzi 1998 ) .",
    "even though the broad uv wavelength coverage ( g130h , g190h , g270h gratings ) of the key project spectra allowed the discovery of many  absorbers at @xmath21 , the detection efficiency of low redshift ( @xmath22 ) absorbers was reduced by lower than expected far - uv sensitivity of the fos digicon .",
    "the fos key project survey firmly established the column density distribution , @xmath23 ( ) , for high-  absorbers and @xmath24 , the number density of absorbers per unit redshift . above limiting  equivalent width ,",
    "@xmath25  m  ( @xmath7  @xmath1 ) , weymann ( 1998 ) found @xmath26 over a substantial redshift pathlength ( @xmath27 30 ) .",
    "as we discuss below , the  line density increases substantially to lower columns , reaching @xmath5 for @xmath6  2 ( paper  iv ) .    the absorber number density ( weymann 1998 ) shows a dramatic break from rapid evolution ( @xmath28 ) to almost no evolution ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this observation was explained by cosmological hydrodynamical simulations ( dav 1999 ) , in which the rapid evolution in @xmath24 is controlled by the response of photoionized gas to evolving qso populations in a hierarchical distribution of large - scale structure . at high redshift ,",
    "the number of  absorbers decreased rapidly with time , owing to a nearly constant extragalactic ionizing flux from qsos in an expanding universe .",
    "[ the cosmological expansion decreases recombinations , thus decreasing the neutral hydrogen column density .",
    "] at @xmath30 , the ionizing flux began a rapid decline with the rapidly decreasing qso numbers and/or luminosities , thereby decreasing the ionized fraction in the  absorbers .",
    "as a consequence of reduced photoionization , along with large - scale structure formation , the @xmath24 evolution slowed rapidly . although the key project discovered only one dla ( jannuzi 1998 ) , rao & turnshek ( 1998 ) used fos to increase the number of low-@xmath15 dlas by targeting strong mg  ii absorbers found by ground - based telescopes .",
    "bowen ( 1996 ) used archival fos spectra to search for strong  and metal - line absorption from known foreground galaxies . see bowen ,",
    "pettini , & blades ( 2002 ) for a stis extension of this successful project .",
    "the _ goddard high - resolution spectrograph _ ( ghrs ) was used to co - discover ( morris 1991 ) the   absorbers in the 3c  273 sightline .",
    "however , few qsos were sufficiently bright to observe in moderate - length integrations .",
    "tripp , lu , & savage ( 1998 ) and impey , petry , & flint ( 1999 ) observed a few uv - bright agn targets with the low - resolution far - uv ghrs grating , obtaining observations only slightly more sensitive than the fos key project spectra . in the mid-1990s ,",
    "the colorado group conducted a moderate - resolution ( @xmath2 20 ) survey of 15 sightlines with the ghrs / g160 m first - order grating ( papers i and ii ) , followed by a comparable survey of 15 additional targets with the stis first - order , medium - resolution grating g140 m ( paper iv ) . in these surveys , the key strategy was to select only the brightest targets ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , while observing only a modest pathlength per target ( @xmath31 10,000   with ghrs and 20,000  with stis ) .",
    "the number density of   absorbers rises steeply with decreasing equivalent width .",
    "after subtracting intrinsic absorbers ( near the redshift of the qso ) we found 187 intervening low-  absorbers at @xmath32 significance over a total unobscured pathlength @xmath33 . a careful analysis , accounting for s / n sensitivity bias and overlap with galactic interstellar lines , gives a line density @xmath5 for @xmath6  @xmath1 , or one absorber every @xmath34 mpc .",
    "our more sensitive ghrs / stis survey provides an important extension of the key project to lower-  absorbers . as shown in figure 2 ,",
    "the very best spectra in our survey reach equivalent - width limits of @xmath35 10 - 20  m   ( @xmath36 ) , corresponding to @xmath37 2 , comparable to the best spectra obtained with keck / hires or vlt / uves .",
    "the cosmic evolution of the ly@xmath16  forest absorbers shown in figure 3 represents the historical record of a large fraction of the baryons during the emergence of the modern universe at @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath24 evolution of the high-  absorbers exhibits a substantial break in slope to a much slower evolution at @xmath381.5 , as expected from the physical effects acting on intergalactic absorbers in an expanding universe .",
    "the low-  data point at @xmath39 from our survey is lower than that of the key project .",
    "we suspect this results from our survey s higher spectral resolution , which affects the counting and -bin assignments of weak absorbers .",
    "the break in the @xmath24 evolution of the higher-   absorbers is therefore not as dramatic as the key project data suggest .",
    "a more gradual decline in slope is also more consistent with the simulations in a @xmath40cdm universe model ( dav et  al .",
    "the physical effects that account for the break in the high - column @xmath24 should create a similar break in the evolution of the lower-  absorbers , although this is not yet evident in figure 3 .",
    "new stis spectra obtained by b. jannuzi and collaborators should determine whether the expected break is present , and whether the numerical simulations have used the correct physics to account for these absorbers .",
    "recently , several investigators have used stis in its medium - resolution ( @xmath41 ) echelle modes ( e140 m and e230 m ) to obtain long integrations on bright agn targets .",
    "many of these spectra have been analyzed for interesting individual absorbers , including a growing number of redshifted o  vi absorbers : h1821 + 643 ( tripp 2000 , 2001 ) ; 3c  273 ( sembach 2001 ; tripp 2002 ) ; pg  0953 + 415 ( savage 2002 ) ; pks  2155 - 304 ( shull 2003 ) ; pg  1259 + 593 ( richter 2004 ) ; pg  1116 + 215 ( sembach 2004 ) ; and pg  1211 + 143 ( tumlinson 2004 ) . these spectra have the potential to be hst s best resource for low-@xmath15  absorber studies . as of july 2004 , 35 bright agn have been observed in stis - echelle mode , providing in some cases the most sensitive detection limits for , as well as significant pathlengths at @xmath42 for potential discovery of o  vi absorbers . in the absence of the _ cosmic origins spectrograph",
    "_ , the stis medium - resolution echelle gratings continue to provide high - quality qso spectra for igm studies .",
    "however , obtaining the s / n needed to make sound inferences about the igm absorbers requires increasingly long integration times on fainter targets .",
    "at high redshift ( @xmath43 ) the number density of  absorbers is so large that estimates of their total baryonic masses , after substantial ionization corrections for photoionization equilibrium , suggest that the entire baryon content of the universe ( @xmath44 , as measured by the cosmic microwave background anisotropies or cosmic [ d / h ] ratio ) can be accomodated within the warm ( @xmath45  k ) photoionized igm ( rauch 1997 ; schaye 2001 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with numerical simulations of large - scale structure formation ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav 1999 , 2001 ) , which also predict that by @xmath39 the baryons are approximately evenly divided among several components as follows :    * * stars and gas in or near galaxies ; 30% predicted*. salucci & persic ( 1999 ) and fukugita ( 2004 ) account for only @xmath46% in this reservoir . *",
    "* very hot ( @xmath47  k ) intracluster and intragroup gas ; @xmath4810% predicted*. fukugita ( 2004 ) estimates only @xmath49% of the baryons in this component , but the gas in groups may not be fully accounted for . *",
    "* warm ( @xmath50  k ) photoionized gas ; 3040% predicted in  forest absorbers*. in our paper iv , we find @xmath51% of the baryons in local  absorbers . * * warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) at @xmath52  k ; 2040% predicted*. a series of observations with hst and fuse ( tripp , savage , & jenkins 2000 ; savage 2002 ) estimate that 5 - 10% of the baryons have been detected ( at 10% assumed o / h metallicity ) through o  vi absorption .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations of o  vii absorption ( fang 2002 ; nicastro 2004 ) suggest even larger percentages , although with enormous statistical uncertainties and a few unconfirmed observations .",
    "thus , we submit that the current - epoch baryon census remains an unsolved problem , with large and uncertain corrections for ionization state ( h  i , o  vi , and o  vii ) and an overall uncertainty over the appropriate metallicity ( for o  vi , o  vii , o  viii in whim ) . these problems can be addressed by hst and fuse in the coming years , and by future high - throughput x - ray spectroscopic missions such as _ constellation - x _ or _",
    "xeus_.      in paper ii , we described a method for estimating the baryon content of the local  absorbers , based upon the observed column density distribution . in the context of optically - thin , photoionized clouds , the assumptions of this simplified model",
    "are : ( 1 ) spherically symmetric absorbers ; ( 2 ) an isothermal density profile ; ( 3 ) absorber sizes of @xmath53  kpc , based on qso pairs experiments conducted at somewhat higher redshifts ( dinshaw 1997 , but see also rosenberg 2003 ) ; and ( 4 ) a value and slope for the extragalactic ionizing flux ( shull 1999 ) using space densities and ionizing spectra of local seyfert galaxies ( telfer 2002 ) .",
    "however , numerical simulations show that  absorbers are not at all spherical , especially at lower column densities .",
    "cen & simcoe ( 1997 ) used numerical simulations at @xmath15=24 to show that lower column density ( @xmath54  2 ) absorbers have large physical sizes , consistent with or somewhat larger than @xmath53  kpc ( equivalent spherical radius ) .",
    "we have integrated this simplified model over our observed column density distribution , from 12.5 @xmath48 log  @xmath55 , the range where the above assumptions are most valid . in paper",
    "ii we obtained a baryon fraction @xmath56% , with specific dependences on measurable parameters as follows : @xmath57^{1/2 } h_{70}^{-1 } \\ ; .\\ ] ] here , @xmath58 is the characteristic h  i column density in the  forest in units of @xmath59  2 , @xmath60 is the extragalactic ionizing specific intensity at 1 ryd in units of @xmath61 erg  @xmath1 s@xmath62 hz@xmath62 sr@xmath62 , @xmath63 is the characteristic absorber radius in units of @xmath64 kpc , and @xmath65 is the mean power - law spectral index ( @xmath66 ) for the metagalactic ionizing radiation , which presumably comes from qsos ( shull 1999 ; telfer 2002 ) .",
    "schaye ( 2001 ) developed a methodology for estimating the baryon content that makes somewhat different assumptions .",
    "as with the method of our paper ii , this model assumes photoionization of optically - thin absorbers , but it also assumes gravitationally - bound clouds whose observed column densities are equal to their characteristic column densities over a jeans length .",
    "this estimate has the following specific dependences : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the h  i photoionization rate in units of @xmath69  s@xmath62 , @xmath70 is the igm temperature in units of @xmath50  k , and @xmath71 is the h  i column density distribution . in this model ,",
    "the absorber baryon content depends on the minimum column density of h  i absorbers as @xmath72 or @xmath73 for @xmath74 ( see below ) .",
    "the above expression assumes that the  absorbers contain the universal ratio of baryons to dark matter , with no bias .    here",
    "we employ both of these methods to estimate the baryon content of the local  absorbers , based on our latest column density distribution from paper iv , which fitted power - law slopes of @xmath74 and @xmath75 on the lower and upper sides , respectively , of a break at @xmath76  2 . from our enlarged sample ,",
    "we are confident that the @xmath77 slope extends down to at least log  = 12.5 , so that we can reliably integrate this distribution from log  = 12.5 to 16.0 .",
    "we recognize that , at or near our adopted lower limit ( which corresponds approximately to an overdensity @xmath78 at the current epoch ) , some of the assumptions of both methods may break down .",
    "also , at @xmath79  2 , absorbers become optically thick in the lyman continuum and can hide additional gas mass . therefore , neither method can hope to derive an extremely accurate measurement for the baryon content of the  forest , even if the column density distribution and other absorber properties ( size , ionizing flux , temperature ) are known to some precision .",
    "we quote the resulting baryon densities as percentages of the total baryon density from measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy ( @xmath80 , spergel 2003 ) .",
    "a slightly smaller total baryon density has recently been obtained by measurement of d / h in a high-@xmath15 qso absorber ( @xmath81 , kirkman 2003 ) .",
    "the baryon fraction in the igm is dominated by the lower column density absorbers ( 22% out of 29% total baryons in  absorbers at   @xmath82  2 ) , owing to the steep slope of the column density distribution .",
    "the schaye ( 2001 ) prescription yields a divergent baryon fraction at low , owing to an inverse dependence of size on column density , which must break down well above the limit employed here . on the other hand , at @xmath12 10@xmath83 @xmath1 , the 100 kpc size assumed in paper ii probably becomes too large for many absorbers at higher column densities ( cen & simcoe 1997 ; tripp 2002 ) .",
    "thus , the most conservative , and we believe most accurate approach , is to use our paper ii method at low columns and the schaye ( 2001 ) method at high columns .",
    "this technique yields values of 22@xmath842% below @xmath76  2 , and @xmath85% above that column density , for a total baryon fraction in the low-@xmath15 photoionized igm of @xmath86% ( paper iv ) . because the baryon fraction is dominated by the lowest column density absorbers , our result is relatively insensitive to the assumed @xmath19-values for individual absorbers . here , we have used @xmath87 , which is comparable to the median @xmath88  found by dav & tripp ( 2001 ) using medium - resolution echelle spectra .    in order to make further progress in the baryon census of warm igm gas ,",
    "it is important to : ( 1 ) estimate absorber sizes and shapes ( and thus equivalent cloud radii ) as a function of column density . in the absence of observations of many qso pairs",
    ", this is best done using numerical simulations ( the cen & simcoe [ 1997 ] analysis , but for simulations at @xmath39 ) ; ( 2 ) estimate the percentage of  absorbers that are collisionally ionized rather than photoionized .",
    "this will require observations of o  vi with fuse or hst to address the `` double - counting '' issue ; see   3.2 ; ( 3 ) observe a much longer pathlength for  absorbers , since we find that the bias introduced by cosmic variance is still significant for the observed redshift pathlength , @xmath89 ( paper iv ) ; ( 4 ) determine more accurate h  i column densities from fuse observations of higher lyman lines and a curve - of - growth analysis ( e.g. , shull 2000 ; sembach 2001 ) for saturated absorbers ; and ( 5 ) observe a few very bright targets over very long integration times ( @xmath90 orbits ) to push the detection limits below @xmath91 2 ; very weak absorbers can still contribute to the baryon budget .",
    "the search for the whim gas has now begun , using sensitive uv resonance absorption lines : primarily the o  vi lithium - like ( @xmath92 ) doublet ( 1031.926 , 1037.617   ) but also the li - like doublet of ne  viii ( 770.409 , 780.324   )  see savage ( 2004 ) .",
    "the o  vi lines can be observed with hst / stis for igm absorbers with @xmath42 , while the fuse spectrographs can observe o  vi essentially down to @xmath93 .",
    "the k - shell x - ray absorption lines of o  vii ( 21.602   ) , o  viii ( 18.97   ) , n  vii ( 24.782   ) , ne  ix ( 13.447   ) , and a few other highly ionized species can ( barely ) be observed with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm / newton _ , primarily toward x - ray flaring blazars . as mentioned in   2 , there now exists a substantial number ( 35 to our knowledge ) of stis medium - resolution echelle spectra of qsos .",
    "however , fewer than half of these targets have sufficient redshift ( @xmath42 ) and continuum signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n @xmath94 per resolution element ) to facilitate a sensitive search for o  vi absorption .",
    "thus far , only a modest pathlength has been searched for o  vi absorbers with hst ( tripp , savage , & jenkins 2000 ; savage 2002 ) . these spectra yield measured baryon fractions of 510% ( assuming 10%",
    "o / h metallicity ) , consistent with expectations from simulations ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; cen 2001 ; fang & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "we caution that these estimates involve large uncertainties , including untested assumptions of cloud sizes and shapes , metallicities , ionization equilibrium , and multi - phase structure .",
    "the multiphase nature of igm absorbers leads directly to the classic census problem of  double counting \" . in the igm context",
    ", this means that the photoionized h  i and o  vi absorbers could count the same baryons twice .",
    "recent surveys down to 50  m  equivalent width give h  i line densities approximately ten times those of the o  vi absorbers : @xmath95 ( paper iv ) and @xmath96 ( savage 2002 ) .",
    "many igm absorbers ( shull 2003 ) as well as galactic high velocity clouds ( collins 2004 ) clearly contain gas at vastly different temperatures , in order to explain the observed range of ionization stages . deriving the metallicities of such complex systems requires subtle ionization modeling : collisional vs.  photoionization , time - dependent ionization , range of temperatures , inhomogeneities in density and velocity .",
    "theoretical considerations of the shocked igm ( dav 1999 ) suggest that collisional ionization dominates the stronger o  vi systems , although some weak o  vi absorbers have been modeled successfully using photoionization equilibrium ( tripp 2001 ) .",
    "the problem with these photoionization models for high ions is that they require a large photoionization parameter ( @xmath97 ) to produce sufficient o  vi . at fixed ionizing radiation intensity , @xmath98 , this requires very low hydrogen densities , @xmath99 @xmath100 . as a result , photoionization models with high-@xmath101 and low-@xmath102 are physically implausible , since they produce a low neutral fraction , @xmath103 and unrealistically large absorption pathlengths , @xmath104 here , we have scaled the low - redshift parameters to h  i photoionization rate @xmath105 , a temperature @xmath106 , and a typical strong h  i absorber with  @xmath107 .",
    "shull ( 1999 ) find that @xmath108 0.30.7 at @xmath39 ; the ionization rate can also be written @xmath109 $ ] , where @xmath60 is the specific intensity at 1 ryd and @xmath65 is the mean spectral index of the ionizing radiation .",
    "thus , some of the photoionized baryons in the o  vi absorbers may have been accounted for by the h  i calculation in the previous section .",
    "however , the hotter , collisionally ionized o  vi should represent a distinct thermal phase from the h  i.    a substantial survey of o  vi absorbers may reveal systematics among the o  vi absorbers that will allow us to separate the collisionally - ionized absorbers from the photoionized absorbers and thus unravel the double - counting problem .",
    "ongoing stis echelle spectroscopy by tripp , savage , howk , and others will go a long way towards answering these questions and better quantifying the `` o  vi forest '' statistics . equally important to this effort is ongoing fuse spectroscopy of lower - redshift o  vi with complementary   data from _",
    "hubble_. to date , we have found 114  absorbers ( @xmath110  m ) with acceptable o  vi data , and roughly half ( 57 systems ) are detected in o  vi at @xmath111 significance ( danforth & shull 2004 ) .",
    "this combined hst / fuse database can address important questions concerning the extent to which metals are spread away from galaxies into the igm . while much data exist and more is scheduled to be obtained , these are still early days .    if the study of the o  vi absorbers is still in its infancy , the detection of the remainder of the whim gas is not yet `` out of the womb '' .",
    "simulations predict that this hotter whim ( 10@xmath112  k ) contains @xmath12 2040% of the total local baryons .",
    "nicastro ( 2003 ) claims that whim gas at @xmath113  k has been detected at @xmath114 along several sightlines , through absorption lines of o  vi with fuse and of c  vi , o  vii , o  viii , n  vii , and ne  ix with _",
    "chandra _ and/or _",
    "xmm / newton_. however , it is possible that this gas is not intergalactic at all , but instead resides in smaller physical regions in the halo of the milky way ( sembach 2002 ; shull 2003 ; fox 2004 ; collins 2004 ) . while two groups have claimed whim detections at @xmath115 in the sightlines of pks  2155 - 304 ( fang 2002 ) and h1821 + 643 with _",
    "( mathur 2003 ) , neither of these results has been confirmed .",
    "the pks  2155 - 304 detection has been refuted by _",
    "xmm / newton _ observations ( rasmussen 2003 ; cagnoni 2004 ) .",
    "recently , two new whim detections were obtained ( nicastro 2004 ) toward the blazar mrk  421 at @xmath116 , while it flared in x - rays .",
    "the claimed o  vii absorbers lie at @xmath117 ( where a  absorber was identified by shull , stocke , & penton 1996 ) and @xmath118 ( where we see no  or o  vi absorbers to @xmath119 limits of 30  m  and 20  m , respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath118 absorber was detected in three x - ray lines ( n  vi , n  vii , o  vii ) at @xmath120 significance each , while the @xmath117 absorber was seen in only o  vii at @xmath121 significance ( but not in o  viii ) .",
    "the o  viii / o  vii is consistent with whim at temperatures log @xmath122 5.76.5 . over the small observed pathlength , @xmath123",
    ", these @xmath124 detections yield an o  vii line density , @xmath125 , of 24 times that of o  vi , with large uncertainty . the o  vii columns ( @xmath126  @xmath1 ) are @xmath127 times those typically seen in o  vi .",
    "therefore , the baryon fraction in the o  vii - bearing gas could be anywhere from 2070% , with enormous uncertainties arising from cosmic variance of this one short sightline .    a possible one - line whim detection in the _ chandra _ spectrum of 3c  120 ( mckernan 2003 ) yields a similar o  vii line density and baryon fraction .",
    "obviously , the statistics of these studies are poor , and the model assumptions substantial .",
    "sadly , the prospects of further observations with _ chandra _ are remote ; when mrk 421 was observed it was the brightest extragalactic source in the sky ( the brightest extragalactic soft x - ray sources tend to be blazars ) . because the velocity resolution of _ chandra s _ low energy transmission grating is only @xmath2 1000 , one worries about the proximity ( 900 ) of the @xmath118 absorber to the blazar redshift ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath118 absorber might be outflowing gas along a jet and not intervening whim at all . taking this observational program to the level of fuse ( or even hst )",
    "may have to await the _ constellation - x _ grating spectrographs .",
    "while the baryon census and its evolution are ample reasons for studying the local  forest in detail , it is also only at low redshift that the locations of  absorbers and galaxies can be compared accurately .",
    "this allows the relationship between these `` clouds '' and galaxies to be determined to some degree of certainty .",
    "however , the degree to which absorbers correlate with individual galaxies has been controversial .",
    "lanzetta ( 1995 ) and chen ( 1998 , 2001 ) argue that the  absorbers are the very extended halos of individual galaxies , while others ( morris 1993 ; stocke 1995 ; impey , petry , & flint 1999 ; dav 1999 ; papers iii and v ) argue that the absorbers are related to galaxies only through their common association with large - scale gaseous filaments , arising from overdensities in the high - redshift universe .",
    "much of the difference between these results primarily reflects the column density range of the  absorbers studied in each case ; at some level both sides to this argument are correct ( see conference papers in mulchaey & stocke 2002 ) . in this section",
    ", we review the current evidence for the relationship between galaxies and  absorbers as a function of h  i column density .      at the highest column densities ( @xmath128  2 )",
    "exhibits broad damping wings that allow an accurate determination of h  i column density .",
    "this has proved valuable for studying the evolution of the chemical abundance of galaxies with cosmic time , since even quite weak metal lines are detectable in these systems with high - quality spectra ( e.g. , pettini 1999 ; prochaska & wolfe 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "dlas have also been used to measure the evolution of the amount of neutral gas in galaxies ( boissier 2003 ) .",
    "however , clues about the types of galaxies probed by the dlas are largely circumstantial at high redshift .",
    "thick disks of massive galaxies are suggested by the kinematics ( wolfe & prochaska 2000 ) , but are hardly demanded by the evidence .",
    "surveys of dlas with hst ( e.g. , rao & turnshek 2000 ; turnshek 2002 ) and their subsequent imaging with large - aperture ground - based telescopes ( nestor 2002 ; rao 2003 ) have shown convincingly that no single galaxy population dominates the dlas .",
    "surprisingly , there is a large contribution to dlas made by dwarf and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies ( see bowen , tripp , & jenkins 2001 for an excellent example ) in contrast to the wolfe & prochaska ( 2000 ) kinematic analysis . until recently , an apparent contradiction existed between the cross - sectional areas on the sky covered by high column density h  i at @xmath114 as measured either by dlas or by 21  cm emission maps ( rao & briggs 1993 ) .",
    "however , new `` blind '' 21  cm surveys ( zwaan 2001 ; rosenberg & schneider 2003 ) show that the 21-cm cross - sectional area now agrees with the dla measurement at low-@xmath15 .",
    "these new surveys also show that the galaxy populations detected by these two different methods now agree .",
    "rosenberg & schneider ( 2003 ) find that dla galaxies span a wide range of total h  i masses ( two - thirds are between @xmath129 ) and luminosities 0.011 @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the chemical abundance data from dlas at high-@xmath15 must be interpreted with these new hst @xmath130 ground - based results in mind ; that is , the chemical abundance evolution refers to h  i disks and amorphous h  i clumps in a wide variety of galaxies .",
    "this certainly explains the broad spread in dla metallicities at any one redshift .",
    "in the range @xmath11  2 , the lyman limit system ( lls ) absorbers constitute a substantial number ( @xmath131 13 per unit redshift ) of intervening systems in the spectra of high-@xmath15 qsos .",
    "as shown by steidel ( 1995 , 1998 ) , strong ( @xmath132   ) mg  ii absorbers at @xmath133 are invariably also llss , although a few dlas are also present in such samples .",
    "physically , this can be understood because h  i and mg  ii have similar ionization potentials , so that once hydrogen becomes optically thin , mg  ii ionizes rapidly to mg  iii . in an important pre - hst result ,",
    "steidel ( 1995 , 1998 ) found that , of 58 llss in his sample , 55 could be identified with nearby ( @xmath134 kpc offsets ) , bright ( @xmath135 ) galaxies at the same redshift ( see also bergeron & boiss 1991 ) .",
    "these results have been strengthened by obtaining ground - based spectra of the underlying stellar kinematics of the associated galaxies and hst imaging and uv spectra of the c  iv absorptions in these systems ( churchill 2000 ; steidel 2002 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the llss are almost exclusively the bound gaseous halos of luminous galaxies , and that these halos share the kinematics of the underlying stellar disk .",
    "recently , hst observations of the quasar 3c  232 probed the halo of the modest starburst galaxy ngc 3067 .",
    "the spectra show a complex lls with three absorption components at small radial velocity differences ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) from the nucleus of ngc 3067 , in ions ranging from na  i and ca  ii detected optically ( stocke 1991 ) to mg  i , mg  ii , fe  ii and mn  ii in the near - uv ( tumlinson 1999 ) to si  iv and c  iv in the far - uv . surprisingly , all these species share the same three velocities ( keeney et al .",
    "2005 ) , which are gravitationally bound to ngc 3067 ; two of the systems , including the strongest at @xmath139 2 , are infalling .",
    "the 3c  232 sightline has an offset of @xmath140 kpc from the nucleus of ngc 3067 ; the sightline clearly penetrates extra - planar h  i , seen in 21  cm emission with the vla ( carilli & van gorkom 1992 ) .",
    "the h  i column densities , kinematics , metallicity , spin temperature , and inferred size of these clouds are similar to high velocity clouds in the milky way .",
    "thus , despite a modest starburst ( @xmath141  yr@xmath62 ) in this @xmath142 galaxy , even the high ionization gas does not appear to be escaping .",
    "in summary , both the detailed hst and ground - based observations of this nearby lls and the cumulative data from the steidel lls sample are consistent with llss being the bound , gaseous halos of luminous galaxies .",
    "both the hst qso absorption line key project and our ghrs / stis  survey of papers i  iv have found large numbers of intermediate column density ( @xmath143  2 )  absorbers at low redshift .",
    "available hst or fuse spectra are not sensitive enough to detect metals ( c  ii / iii / iv , si  ii / iii / iv , o  vi ) in these absorbers , except in a few cases at @xmath144  @xmath1 .",
    "for example , metallicities have been measured to 110% of solar values in strong  absorbers in the sightlines toward 3c  273 ( sembach 2001 ; tripp 2002 ) , pks  2155 - 304 ( shull 1998 , 2003 ) , pg  1259 + 593 ( richter 2004 ) , and pg  1211 + 143 ( tumlinson 2004 ) . in an ongoing survey ,",
    "danforth & shull ( 2004 ) have found that @xmath250% of all   absorbers contain both h  i and o  vi in the  range for which high - quality fuse spectra exist .",
    "the  multiphase ratio \" ,",
    "n(h  i)/n(o  vi ) , varies substantially , from @xmath145 to greater than 100 ( shull 2003 ; danforth & shull 2004 ) , probably indicating a wide range in shock velocities , and possibly o / h abundances , in these multiphase systems .    given these statistics , it is conceivable that a large fraction of @xmath39  absorbers at @xmath146  2 contain metals .",
    "the o  vi non - detections are either at lower ionization ( lower shock velocity ) than allows significant columns of o  vi , or at slightly lower metallicity than the fuse sensitivity limits can detect .",
    "since most or all  absorbers at @xmath43 in this column density range contain c  iv and/or o  vi absorption lines at metallicities @xmath147 = -1 $ ] to @xmath148 ( e.g. , schaye 2000 ) , it is not surprising that many low column density , low-@xmath15 absorbers would contain some metals .",
    "thus , some relationship with nearby galaxies is expected .",
    "figure 4 shows the galaxies surrounding the sightline to pks  2155 - 304 , coincident with a cluster of strong  absorbers , in which c  iv or si  iii have not been detected to a limit of @xmath23% solar metallicity ( there are two weak o  vi absorbers detected by fuse ) .",
    "lanzetta ( 1995 ) and chen ( 1998 , 2001 ) obtained deep images and multi - object spectroscopy for a large number of galaxies in the fields of key project absorbers .",
    "lanzetta ( 2002 ) summarizes the evidence for a @xmath230% success rate in matching redshifts of absorbers and luminous galaxies within @xmath149  kpc of the sightline .",
    "they then extrapolate to the conclusion that all fos - discovered  absorbers can be associated with very extended galaxy halos .",
    "chen ( 1998 ) found that , with the exception of a weak dependence on galaxy luminosity , there is no nearest - galaxy property that correlates with absorber properties . on the other hand , using   absorbers at somewhat lower column densities , morris ( 1993 ) ,",
    "tripp , lu , & savage ( 1998 ) , impey , petry , & flint ( 1999 ) and our papers iii and v found no convincing statistical evidence that these ghrs- and stis - discovered absorbers are associated with individual galaxies down to @xmath150 luminosities .",
    "however , over 3/4 of these weak absorbers are found in galaxy large - scale structure filaments ( paper iii ) , with bright galaxies several hundred kpc away . stocke ( 2002 ) summarizes the evidence in favor of this position . at the extremes of the column density range",
    "are obvious examples that both of these positions are correct for some absorbers ; at the high-  end of this range , llss are so close to the nearby bright galaxy that an association of some sort seems inevitable .",
    "on the other hand , an increasing percentage of lower column density absorbers are found in galaxy voids ( papers iii and v ) , more than @xmath151 mpc from the nearest bright or faint galaxy ( mclin 2001 ) . at intermediate ,",
    "the absorbers adjacent to gas - rich galaxies do not have velocities consistent with rotation curves of the nearby galaxy .",
    "this suggests no kinematic link to the nearby galaxy ( ct 2002 ; putman 2004 ) , in contrast to the steidel ( 2002 ) kinematic analysis of llss and their associated galaxies that often shows a relationship between absorber metal - line velocities and the kinematics of the underlying stellar disk .",
    "recently , the discovery ( stocke 2004 ) of a dwarf ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 ) post - starburst galaxy @xmath154  kpc from a weak - metal line absorber ( figure 5 ) with @xmath155  2 suggests a solution compatible with all the data presented above .",
    "not only do the absorber and galaxy redshifts match to within their combined errors , but the absorber metallicity ( 6% solar ) and the mean stellar metallicity of the galaxy ( @xmath210% solar ) approximately match .",
    "further , the absorber has an overabundance of silicon to carbon indicative of recent supernova type ii enrichment .",
    "the galaxy is a pure disk system whose optical spectrum has both strong balmer and metal absorption lines , and no evidence for dust or gas ( no emission lines and @xmath156 ; van gorkom 1993 ) . from ratios of lick absorption - line indices",
    ", we estimate that the mean stellar age in this galaxy is @xmath157 gyrs . taken together",
    ", this information provides a consistent picture in which a massive ( @xmath158 yr@xmath62 ) starburst @xmath159 gyrs ago created enough supernovae to blow away the remaining gas from this galaxy into the igm .",
    "because the dwarf is quite low mass , this wind can easily escape from the galaxy and move to @xmath160 kpc at the required 2030  to create the metal - line absorber that we see between us and 3c  273 .    because this is the nearest weak metal - line system known",
    ", many other similar absorbers could arise from starburst winds produced by dwarf galaxies too faint to be detected by the above surveys ( at @xmath161 , a galaxy like this dwarf would have @xmath162 ) .",
    "this explains why lanzetta ( 1995 ) found bright galaxies @xmath163 kpc away that do not have properties that correlate with absorber properties .",
    "these absorbers were produced not by the bright galaxy , but by a dwarf or dwarfs that accompany the bright galaxy .",
    "this also explains the correlation between absorber locations and large - scale structure in the samples of paper iii and impey , petry & flint ( 1999 ) .",
    "because dwarf galaxies are so numerous ( 13 mpc@xmath164 ) , if each dwarf galaxy had at least one massive starburst that ejected most or all of the gas from the galaxy to a distance of @xmath160 kpc , this process would be sufficient to create several hundred weak metal - line absorbers per unit redshift .",
    "this number is comparable to the line density of all metal - line absorbers at @xmath165 . while this dwarf galaxy would have been much more luminous ( @xmath166 ) when it was `` starbursting ''",
    ", the present - day absence of gas means that it will no longer form stars and will eventually fade to the approximate luminosity of a local group dwarf spheroidal .",
    "thus , the dwarf in figure 5 is the expected intermediate stage between the `` faint blue galaxies '' seen at @xmath167 and the present - day dwarf spheroids ( babul & rees 1992 ) .",
    "that such `` cheshire cat '' galaxies might be responsible for a large portion of the  forest was suggested by salpeter ( 1993 ) and charlton ( 1995 ) .",
    "however attractive this solution appears , based upon this one example , an equally plausible solution consistent with all available data is that large - scale filaments of galaxies are enriched with metals throughout the filament to approximately the same metallicity . in this picture ,",
    "metal enrichment is not due to any one galaxy .",
    "indeed , in some environments , this almost has to be the case",
    ". in the virgo cluster , studied through qso absorption line probes by impey , petry & flint ( 1999 ) , no nearby dwarf galaxies were found , despite a galaxy redshift survey complete to @xmath168 . in some cases ( the @xmath169",
    "h  i @xmath130 o  vi absorber toward 3c  273 , tripp 2002 ; and the 1666  metal - line absorber toward rxj 1230.8 + 0115 , rosenberg 2003 ) weak metal - line absorbers have no nearby ( @xmath170 kpc ) galaxies , despite a considerable redshift survey effort . while our galaxy surveying continues in these directions , these two hypotheses may not be easy to discriminate .",
    "however , a statistical study of the distances that metal - enriched gas extends away from galaxies may help to select the better model .",
    "many of the lowest-  absorbers could be metal - free , a hypothesis consistent with all available data at high and low redshift . although hst does not have the sensitivity to address this question directly , there is considerable circumstantial evidence in favor of this hypothesis .",
    "while @xmath280% of all low column density  absorbers are found in galaxy filaments , the remaining 20% and an increasing percentage of absorbers with decreasing column densities , are found @xmath171 mpc from the nearest bright galaxy .",
    "a deep survey of the few nearest examples of `` void absorbers '' ( mclin et al . 2002 ) found no faint galaxies ( @xmath172 to @xmath173 , depending on sightline ) within several hundred kpc of these absorbers .",
    "thus , there is no plausible nearby source for metals in these absorbers . in paper iv",
    ", we presented a two - point correlation function ( tpcf ) in absorber velocity separation that showed excess power at @xmath174  but only for the higher column density absorbers in our sample ( @xmath175  m ) . the lower column density absorbers ( @xmath176 ) appear to be randomly distributed in space with no excess power at any @xmath177 ( paper iv ) .",
    "searches for metals in the highest column density `` void absorbers '' are capable of setting metallicity limits at @xmath147 \\approx -2 $ ] ( b. keeney 2004 , private communication ) , but some high-@xmath15 absorbers contain metals at even lower metallicities .",
    "therefore , even deeper hst observations of very bright targets are required to test this interesting hypothesis .",
    "when hst servicing mission 4 was still scheduled , the installation of the _ cosmic origins spectrograph _ ( cos ) on hst was eagerly awaited by astronomers who study the local igm . with 1020 times",

    "do they contain metals and at what metallicity ?",

    "their metals provide an important `` fossil record '' of very early star formation .",
    "* extent of metal transport away from galaxies.*@xmath180 how far away from star formation sites do metals spread in the igm ?",
    "what types of galaxies are responsible for enriching the igm in metals ? can details of nucleosynthesis be found in the igm to understand early star formation history and evolution ?",
    "* accurate h  i column densities .",
    "* fuse observations of higher lyman lines can be used to obtain accurate h  i column densities by curve - of - growth techniques .",
    "these are also essential for accurate metallicities .",
    "therefore , this goal is best carried out while fuse and hst are both still operational .",
    "* physical properties of igm absorbers . * the column density distribution , @xmath19-value distribution ( temperature ) , detailed relationship to galaxies and other properties are still affected by cosmic variance .",
    "obtaining 1020 high signal - to - noise stis medium - resolution echelle spectra or a similar number of high - quality cos spectra of @xmath181 qsos would be sufficient to address concerns about cosmic variance for  absorbers , but not for the rarer o  vi absorbers . for o",
    "vi , fuse spectroscopy of already detected  absorption lines appears to be a viable route to obtaining a sufficient sample .",
    "one could also use hst / stis data on qso targets at @xmath182 ( to shift o  vi @xmath183 or @xmath184 into the hst / stis band ) .",
    "this project also means observing fainter targets for many more orbits .",
    "* size of igm absorbers in galaxy filaments and voids.*@xmath180 qso pairs available to perform these observations are too faint to observe adequately with stis .",

    "<S> in this review , we describe our surveys of low column density ( ) absorbers ( @xmath0  @xmath1 ) , which show that the warm photoionized igm contains @xmath230% of all baryons at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this fraction is consistent with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations , which also predict that an additional 2040% of the baryons reside in much hotter 10@xmath4  k gas , the warm - hot igm ( whim ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observed line density of  absorbers , @xmath5 for @xmath6 2 , is dominated by low-  systems that exhibit slower redshift evolution than those with @xmath7  2 . </S>",
    "<S> hst / fuse surveys of o  vi absorbers , together with recent detections of o  vii with _ </S>",
    "<S> chandra _ and _ xmm / newton _ , suggest that anywhere from 2070% ( with large errors ) of the baryons could reside in the whim , for an assumed abundance o / h @xmath8 10% solar . </S>",
    "<S> we also review the relationship between the various types of   absorbers and galaxies . at the highest column densities ,  @xmath9  @xmath1 , the damped  ( dla ) systems </S>",
    "<S> are often identified with gas - rich disks of galaxies over a large range in luminosities ( 0.031  @xmath10 ) and morphologies . </S>",
    "<S> lyman - limit systems ( @xmath11  @xmath1 ) appear to be associated with bound bright ( @xmath12 0.10.3 @xmath10 ) galaxy halos . </S>",
    "<S> the  absorbers with @xmath13  @xmath1 are associated with filaments of large - scale structure in the galaxy distribution , although some may arise in unbound winds from dwarf galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our discovery that @xmath14% of low-@xmath15  absorbers reside in galaxy voids suggests that a substantial fraction of baryons may be entirely unrelated to galaxies . in the future </S>",
