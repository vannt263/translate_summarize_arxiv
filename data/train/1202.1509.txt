    "hydrodynamics has been central to the interpretation of experimental results from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite .",
    "even relatively simple hydrodynamic models that include neither the effects of viscosity , a realistic phase transition , nor hadronic rescattering are able to roughly reproduce such important observables as the transverse momentum spectra and the large anisotropic flow observed at mid - rapidity @xcite . despite difficulties in describing these mid - rapidity observables simultaneously with the femtoscopic source sizes and elliptic flow at non - zero longitudinal rapidity @xcite , the results strongly suggested underlying collective behavior and",
    "were taken as strong evidence for the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .    since that time",
    ", considerable effort has been expended by the modeling community to characterize and constrain the properties of the matter created in these heavy ion collisions . in particular ,",
    "several models have focused on developing viscous hydrodynamics for the detailed description of anisotropic flow at mid - rapidity to constrain the viscosity of the qgp @xcite . to simplify the calculations ,",
    "most of these models have restricted themselves to mid - rapidity and used the expected approximate boost invariance near zero rapidity @xcite to motivate two - dimensional treatments .    in reality , the spectrum of produced particles is well described by a gaussian of radius @xmath01.6 units in rapidity @xcite , and one questions the extent to which the finiteness of the extent affects the evolution at mid - rapidity .",
    "furthermore , the character of the results away from mid - rapidity display some interesting trends that likely provide some unique and useful constraints on the character of the matter produced and the important features of the theory that governs the production of that matter . to this end",
    ", we endeavor to explore the predictions of viscous hydrodynamics in the full configuration space .",
    "we consider a system of interacting particles .",
    "when the density of particles is relatively low and the mean free paths for particles in the systems are larger than characteristic inter - particle separations , the system can be described as a series of binary collisions .",
    "one can then describe the evolution with a boltzmann equation , which requires following the evolution of the six - dimensional phase space density , @xmath1 , for each species .",
    "when the mean free path is much smaller than the characteristic size of the system , the local phase space distribution takes on a thermal form , and the system and its evolution can be described by following a small number of variables in configuration space , i.e. , current densities ( @xmath2 ) and the stress - energy tensor ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the equations of motion for the quantities are driven by the conservation laws : @xmath4    in terms of thermodynamic variables , i.e. energy density ( @xmath5 ) and pressure ( @xmath6 ) , the stress - energy tensor for ideal hydrodynamics is @xmath7 where @xmath8 = diag(1 , -1 , -1 , -1 ) is the metric tensor .",
    "this expression makes clear that one still requires an equation of state to link the thermodynamic variables - i.e. @xmath9 - in order to close the system of equations .",
    "if the distribution function is allowed to deviate modestly from the equilibrium value , the theory may be extended to account for the effects of a finite mean free path @xcite with viscous treatments .",
    "roughly , one assumes that collisions cause the stress - energy tensor to relax toward the navier - stokes value or that the corresponding modification to the stress energy tensor ( @xmath10 ) leads to a quadratic increase to the equilibrium entropy density @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion are then taken either from higher moments of the boltzmann equations or from the local conservation of the modified entropy density @xcite .",
    "such a construction requires the introduction of several new transport coefficients , but supplies equations of motion that apply to systems further from equilibrium . in this case",
    ", we will only allow the transport coefficients associated with shear viscosity to be non - zero .",
    "this introduces two new quantities : the shear viscosity ( @xmath11 ) and the shear relaxation time ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the resulting equations of motion are the conservation of stress energy tensor and the relaxation of the shear tensor to the navier - stokes value @xcite : @xmath13 the tildes denote quantities determined in the frame of the matter , and roman indices denote that only spatial indices are being considered . here",
    ", @xmath14 is the viscous correction to the stress - energy tensor . in the frame of the matter @xmath15 due its orthogonality to the collective velocity .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is related to the equilibrium fluctuation of @xmath17 , and has the same units of pressure @xcite . for a conformal theory it can be replaced with the energy density @xcite .    for reasons of clarity , we choose to tabulate moments of the local shear tensor defined @xmath18 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this choice of moments clearly separates the shear effects of the strong initial longitudinal expansion into the variable @xmath19 , whereas @xmath20 will contain only the effects of the anisotropic transverse expansion .",
    "furthermore , we have limited the number of variables to the minimum - gaining speed but sacrificing the possibility of a check on the numerical accuracy of the solution .",
    "hydrodynamic models best apply to the matter at small spatial rapidity soon after the rapidly receding nuclei have passed through one another .",
    "the spatial rapidity is defined by @xmath21 and is a measure of the longitudinal position , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "for a boost - invariant system , the collective velocity is @xmath23 , which makes the spatial rapidity equal to the rapidity of the matter .",
    "the condition @xmath23 describes a system where each density element had a trajectory that began at @xmath24 , and did not accelerate from that point . from the perspective of hydrodynamics",
    ", the lack of acceleration is expected if intrinsic quantities , such as energy density , vary slowly with @xmath25 and depend mainly on the proper time @xmath26 .",
    "this approximate symmetry motivates using hydrodynamic prescriptions where @xmath25 is neglected , even in the presence of viscosity , which then reduces the dimensionality of the model from three to two .",
    "of course , such a model only applies to observables measured near mid - rapidity .",
    "a principal goal of this study is to discern the validity of this approximation by comparing two- and three - dimensional versions .",
    "while considerable progress has been made into viscous hydrodynamics for event - by - event conditions with fluctuations @xcite , for this paper we choose a simpler approach and assume averaged initial conditions such as those from the optical glauber model @xcite .",
    "we begin with a woods - saxon distribution of nucleons @xmath27}}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 fm , @xmath29 fm , and @xmath30 @xmath31 for au nuclei .",
    "one then considers the total probability of interaction as the nuclei pass completely through one another , which is computed via the nuclear thickness function @xmath32    the initial shape of the system is then scaled either to the number of wounded nucleons or the number of binary collisions .",
    "the difference between the scalings comes from the eligibility for multiple interactions . in the binary collision picture",
    ", nucleons are allowed to interact with one another multiple times during the crossing .",
    "this leads to scaling like the product of the two thickness functions @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total inelastic cross - section for nucleon - nucleon pairs at this collision energy , @xmath35 is the thickness function for a nucleus with a nucleons , and @xmath36 is the impact parameter .    in the wounded nucleon picture , pairs of interacting nucleons are removed via a combinatorial factor leading to @xmath37 + { \\rm sym}.\\ ] ] where the symmetry is between the nuclei a and b. at lower ( sps ) energies , it was found that the number of produced particles scaled with the number of wounded nucleons . for rhic collisions , one expects that there may be deviation from this scaling due to the increasing importance of hard processes .",
    "initial conditions are thus scaled partially to the number of wounded nucleons and partially to the number of binary collisions via @xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is then the fraction of the initial condition scaled to the number of wounded nucleons .",
    "we then take this total number of interactions to be proportional to the initial energy density of the system at some time shortly after crossing .",
    "both the overall energy scale ( @xmath40 ) and the thermalization time ( @xmath41 ) will be considered free parameters of the model , in addition to the fraction of the initial condition scaled to the number of wounded nucleons ( @xmath39 ) . in this paper",
    "we take @xmath42 fm / c , @xmath43 , and for the chosen value of @xmath40 , the central energy density at @xmath44 fm is @xmath45 gev/@xmath46 .",
    "the choice was made to have the energy scale with @xmath47 , rather than entropy , because energy density more justifiably scales with the number of independent superimposed sources .",
    "these parameters are chosen arbitrarily for the current model , as their values will be the subject of a future publication .",
    "the optical glauber prescription sets the shape of the initial energy density in the transverse plane , it does not lend any insight into the longitudinal initial conditions .",
    "for that we turn to the experimental data , which shows little deviation from a simple gaussian profile in longitudinal rapidity . since gaussians tend to remain roughly gaussian in a hydrodynamic expansion @xcite , we choose a gaussian with a radius to be determined along with the other parameters of the model .",
    "for the results presented here , this radius was chosen to be 1.4 units of spatial rapidity .",
    "this choice of longitudinal source is in stark contrast with the long flat region with steep half - gaussian used in other models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , while the glauber model has proven useful in describing the initial state of the matter , a competing model ( cgc ) based on the assumption that the low momentum particles at midrapidity are generated by color fields has also been considered by many modelers @xcite .",
    "generally , cgc initial conditions have larger initial eccentricities and larger gradients in the tails of the transverse energy density , thus requiring somewhat larger shear viscosity to match experimental results @xcite .    with the energy density set ,",
    "there remain nine components of the initial condition of the stress energy tensor to be set . in determining the initial condition for the collective velocity ,",
    "hydrodynamic models have taken the approach that given a system which is newly thermalized , one might expect no transverse collective flow to be present @xcite .",
    "however , since some finite evolution of the system occurs after the crossing but before thermalization , it is unlikely that no evolution of the stress energy tensor should occur .",
    "if bjorken boost invariance is valid , and if the dynamics are driven by a traceless stress energy tensor , one can predict the initial transverse acceleration regardless of the underlying theory @xcite . for small @xmath26",
    "we assume the initial flow is a fraction @xmath48 of this result , we will utilize the result @xmath49 where @xmath48 is introduced as a free parameter of the model .",
    "in this paper we take @xmath50 , or half of the pre - equilibrium flow predicted . in the longitudinal direction",
    ", we will assume that the matter is not moving relative to the bjorken expansion .",
    "finally , the initial values of the shear tensor must be set . in the landau frame ,",
    "the shear tensor is constrained by its orthogonality to the fluid velocity ( @xmath51 ) , traceless - ness ( @xmath52 ) , and symmetry ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "this leaves five components to be determined . in recent history ,",
    "other models have either set all the components to zero initially @xcite or set all the components to their navier - stokes values @xcite .",
    "while using the navier - stokes values have been more prevalent , this approach leads to increasing values of @xmath54 ( x)$ ] for large @xmath55 , because @xmath56 at low temperature .",
    "even for moderately small viscosities ( @xmath57 ) and relevant temperatures ( @xmath58 100 mev ) , one finds values of @xmath59 that approach not just the pressure but the energy density . if @xmath60 the conservation of longitudinal momentum approaches singularity and the longitudinal fluid velocity grows without bound . for initial conditions that reproduce experimental results ,",
    "these problems tend to occur well outside of the freezeout surface .",
    "also , since the relaxation times are very large when the viscous corrections are large , the evolution will tend not to approach such singularities if the initial conditions are not close to them . because relaxation times tend to be short inside the freezeout surface , the system loses its memory of the initial values of the shear tensor within @xmath61 fm / c of the onset of hydrodynamics .",
    "for this study , the initial value of @xmath62 is chosen independent of position , leaving the effects of varying the parameter as a topic for future study .",
    "as discussed above , the model is designed to explore predictions of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics using averaged initial conditions .",
    "since this avoids encountering the small - scale fluctuations of event - by - event hydrodynamics , the code does not invoke any aggressive scheme for solving the conservation equations in the presence of singularities or shocks .",
    "instead , the ten equations of motion ( appx .",
    "b ) are solved simultaneously using the second order runge - kutta ( predictor - corrector ) method on a fixed mesh in the expanding , bjorken coordinates .",
    "spatial derivatives of the integration variables are determined by second order central finite differences , and are corrected for the collective flow and the bjorken expansion ( appx .",
    "the set of variables to be integrated are : the energy density , the fluid velocity relative to the bjorken expansion , and the five components of the shear tensor in the matter frame , @xmath63 .",
    "one of the advantages of choosing matter frame variables is that restrictions to the maximum deviation from equilibrium are more easily applied , though such restrictions are not used in this paper .",
    "the algorithm verifies the conservation the integral of @xmath64 in the mesh frame : @xmath65 \\\\ c & = &   \\displaystyle\\int   t^{00 } \\tau d\\eta dx dy    + \\displaystyle\\int d\\tau \\left [ \\displaystyle\\oint t^{0i } ds^i   + \\displaystyle\\int \\frac{t^{zz}}{\\tau } \\tau d\\eta dx dy \\right ]   \\label{eq : const}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second term in eq .",
    "[ eq : const ] is the outgoing flux of @xmath66 through a surface element @xmath67 , the second term is the work done by the expansion of the mesh , and @xmath68 is a constant .",
    "this quantity is conserved at the level of a tenth of percent in the three - dimensional viscous case for the cell densities used in this paper , which are @xmath69 ( fm ) and @xmath70 fm / c .",
    "a simple example of further investigation into the veracity of the code is provided in appx . c.",
    "significant progress on the transition region equation of state has been made since the early days of hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "studies of lattice predictions have shown that adjusting for extrapolation to physical masses leads to a less dramatic phase transition at zero baryon chemical potential than originally assumed .",
    "this leads to an equation of state that is stiffer ( higher speed of sound ) through the transition region .",
    "the results presented use the three - flavor equation of state from the wuppertal group @xcite , but fits to milc collaboration @xcite data have also been explored",
    ".    of vital importance to the accuracy of transition to the hadronic cascade will be the matching of the energy density at the freeze - out temperature .",
    "while the above equation - of - state fits roughly reproduce data in the hadronic region , the energy density can disagree on the order of 10% with computations from the hadronic cascade itself . to ensure that this does not occur , we use the equation of state extracted directly from the hadron gas below the freeze - out temperature ( @xmath71 ) , the lattice data above some temperature ( @xmath72 ) , and in between will merge the two .",
    "we merge continuously in the unitless entropy density @xmath73 via the weighted linear function , @xmath74 with weight @xmath75 } \\right ) }   + 1 \\right].\\ ] ] which ensures the continuity and smoothness of @xmath76 and therefore a continuous speed of sound squared via @xmath77    we take @xmath78 gev and @xmath79 gev .",
    "this choice of parameters leads to significant entropy production at temperatures immediately above the freeze - out surface , which is observed as a soft region in the speed of sound .",
    "once the entropy density has been determined at all relevant temperatures , @xmath80 is evaluated via the integral @xmath81 this procedure was employed to generate @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath82 at a spacing of 1 mev in temperature .",
    "the equation of state was then smoothed via a traditional cubic spline @xcite to ensure consistency and smoothness in the interpolation .",
    "the only remaining thermodynamic variables to be determined are related to the viscosity of the matter .",
    "it is generally thought that away from the cross - over temperature the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density should be larger , although most models have fixed this ratio for all temperatures .",
    "however , viscous suppression of anisotropic flow at rhic seems mostly to be driven by the value of the shear viscosity at the freeze - surface surface @xcite although this may not be true at lhc energies @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the low temperature regions of this model were found to be unstable with this choice and so at very low temperatures the shear viscosity was chosen to continuously vary with the energy density below some temperature well outside of the freeze - out surface ( @xmath83 mev ) .",
    "the model was found to be insensitive to the choice of this temperature as long as the difference between it and the freeze - out temperature was more than 20 mev .    finally , we take the relaxation time to be @xmath84 .",
    "this result can derived from linear response theory under the assumptions that the field loses correlation and that the entropy penalty for small viscous corrections is quadratic @xcite .",
    "we consider three centrality classes corresponding to three impact parameters . for the 0 - 5% centrality class we use @xmath44 fm , @xmath85 fm for 10 - 20% , and @xmath86 for 20 - 30% , which are the values determined by the star collaboration using a monte carlo glauber model @xcite . the energy scale , @xmath40 , fixes the maximum energy density in the most central collisions ( b=2.21 fm ) to be 19.5 gev/@xmath46 at @xmath42 fm / c . the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio is taken to be 0.16 , the initial value of the longitudinal part of the shear tensor @xmath87 , and the initial transverse flow parameter is taken as @xmath50 .",
    "we begin by demonstrating the effects of the finite longitudinal extent on the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "figure [ fig : dens ] shows the energy density at a fixed time along the transverse axes at mid - rapidity .",
    "the energy density near the center of the fireball falls somewhat faster in the full three - dimensional model .",
    "this was expected given that the additional longitudinal acceleration , which is neglected in a boost - invariant expansion , which leads to a slightly more rapid expansion and lower energy densities .",
    "however , the evolution in the periphery has changed surprisingly little .",
    "figure [ fig : dzz ] quantifies the extent to which the velocity gradient at the origin falls faster in the full three - dimensional model . whereas the velocity gradient is @xmath88 in the boost - invariant picture , longitudinal acceleration increases the gradient .",
    "the increase from the bjorken value of the longitudinal velocity shows little dependence on the impact parameter and is at the five percent level .",
    "this suggests that femtoscopic estimates of lifetime based on the boost - invariant assumption are a few percent low .",
    "this discrepancy should be somewhat larger for smaller viscosities , because an increase in transverse pressure should increase the longitudinal acceleration .",
    "figure [ fig : dzz ] suggests that the change in the energy density profile at @xmath89 is due to the presence non - trivial longitudinal expansion , and not due to changes in the transverse flow . in figure",
    "[ fig : uvec ] , we turn our attention to this transverse flow under the same conditions as figure [ fig : dens ] . whereas the energy density differed by up to 5% at midrapidity , we find that the collective velocity differs by a maximum of 1% for the same initial conditions .",
    "this implies that any significant modification to the elliptic flow at midrapidity will not come from changes in the dynamics at @xmath90 , though we can not address changes to the initial conditions require to fit multiplicities or the effects of thermal smearing in this study .",
    "figure [ fig : fos ] shows the difference in the location of the freeze - out surface along the x - axis at mid - rapidity . due to the increased longitudinal velocity gradient in the three - dimensional calculation ,",
    "the system breaks up slightly faster .",
    "all of these changes suggest only modest changes to the mid - rapidity observables predicted by boost - invariant viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "we have presented a new simulation of ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional israel - stewart viscous hydrodynamics for relativistic heavy ion collisions geared toward predictions using average initial conditions . the two - dimensional version of this model was found to be highly consistent with two - dimensional calculations from other groups .",
    "the algorithm conserves @xmath64 at a high level , and in the limit of zero viscosity , entropy was conserved at better than the 0.1% level .",
    "investigations of the effect of the non - trivial longitudinal expansion show the strongest effect at the level of 5% , as the system expands and disintegrates modestly faster than in corresponding two - dimensional calculations .",
    "the effects of the non - trivial expansion are stronger near the center of the fireball than in the periphery .",
    "combined with very small changes to the transverse velocities , this causes the motion of the freeze - out surface to remain almost unchanged until later times when it falls more rapidly .",
    "this suggests that changes to important midrapidity observables like elliptic flow will not be larger than a few percent .",
    "these results suggest that one can ignore the effects of the full three - dimensional expansion if one is satisfied with predictions at the 5% level .",
    "given that many approximations in the model are only trustworthy at the 5% level , these corrections can be considered modest , but can not be classified as fully negligible .",
    "if one were to repeat the comparison at lower energies , the effects would certainly be greater , while at higher energies such as at the lhc , boost invariance should be significantly more justified .",
    "we intend to implement a freeze - out algorithm in the near future . currently , the interface between the cascade and the hydrodynamic model only functions in the two - dimensional version of the code .",
    "once the three - dimensional interface is finished , comparison with data will be performed with observables at and away from mid - rapidity .",

    "for our set of integration variables , we choose a mix of quantities measured in the frame moving with the energy density and quantities measured in a frame undergoing a fixed expansion in spatial rapidity , which we refer to as the mesh frame .",
    "beginning from the equations of motion as viewed in the matter frame , we must boost terms into the mesh frame .",
    "for instance , to track the velocity as observed in the mesh frame it is prudent to evaluate equations of motion in terms of spatial derivatives of the collective velocity in the mesh frame . in addition",
    ", one needs to write the equations of motion in terms of derivatives evaluated on a fixed grid of the mesh frame proper time .",

    "the structure of our code is such that the coefficients associated with time derivatives of tabulated variables are separated from spatial derivatives , leading to the notation @xmath100 where the prime indicates the removal of those terms proportional to time derivatives of tabulated variables .    also among our variables",
    "are terms defined in the frame of the collective motion .",
    "the above construction can not be used to calculate derivatives of these variables .",

    "simply integrating forward with respect to time would produce errors due to the changing reference frame in which @xmath115 is defined .",
    "therefore , one amends this via @xmath116\\ ] ] now , our calculation is based on a fixed mesh in the expanding coordinate system @xmath117 .",
    "given this coordinate system , it only makes sense to choose our variables to be defined in the fixed frame of this coordinate system ( the mesh frame ) .",
    "so when discussing the collective velocity @xmath96 , we refer not to the collective velocity observed in the laboratory frame - the center of mass frame for the collision - but rather to the collective velocity observed by a comover with the longitudinal expansion .",
    "however , our equations of motion will be derived in the frame of the matter - a third , potentially unique lorentz frame . in light of this",
    ", our approach will again be to determine the small correction to be applied to derivatives in the mesh frame and boost this correction back into the matter frame .",
