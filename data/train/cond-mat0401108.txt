    "the properties of arrays of josephson junctions have been of great interest for nearly twenty years.@xcite these arrays are excellent model systems in which to study phenomena such as phase transitions and quantum coherence in two dimensions .",
    "for example , if only the josephson coupling energy is considered , and if the self - inductance and mutual inductance of the array plaquettes are neglected , the hamiltonian of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) array of josephson junctions is formally identical to that of a 2d xy model [ see , e.  g. ref .  ] . in the presence of such inductive effects , this xy description needs to be modified , and several generalizations , which include these effects , have been proposed.@xcite arrays sometimes appear to mimic behavior seen in nominally homogeneous materials , e.g. high-@xmath4 superconductors , which often behave as if they are composed of distinct superconducting regions linked together by josephson coupling.@xcite finally , the arrays are of potentially practical interest : they may be useful , for example , as sources of coherent microwave radiation if the individual junctions can be caused to oscillate in phase in a stable manner .",
    "recently , our ability to achieve this kind of stable oscillation , and coherent microwave radiation , was significantly advanced by a series of experiments by barbara and collaborators.@xcite these workers placed two - dimensional underdamped josephson arrays in a resonant microwave cavity .",
    "the presence of the cavity caused the junctions to couple together with remarkable efficiency , resulting in a highly efficient conversion of the injected d. c. power into a. c. radiation .",
    "even more surprising , this efficiency is achieved in _ underdamped _ arrays , which according to conventional wisdom , should be especially difficult to synchronize , since each such junction is both bistable and hysteretic .",
    "numerous workers have attempted to explain these experiments .",
    "@xcite    in this brief review , we summarize our own model to describe this kind of phase locking.@xcite in section ii , we present the model hamiltonian . in section iii , we describe the equations of motion resulting from this model , in the `` classical limit , '' as defined further below . in section iv",
    ", we give a brief description of the relevant numerical results .",
    "finally , in section v , we present a concluding discussion .",
    "we consider a 2d array of @xmath5 superconducting grains placed in a resonant cavity , which we assume supports only a single photon mode of frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the array thus has @xmath6 square plaquettes .",
    "there are a total of @xmath7 horizontal junctions , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "a current @xmath10 is fed into each of the @xmath11 grains on the left edge of the array , and extracted from each of the @xmath11 grains on the right edge .",
    "thus , the current is injected in the @xmath12 direction , with no external current injected in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "a sketch of this geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dgeometry ] .",
    "we also introduce the terminology that a `` row '' of junctions , in this configuration , refers to a group of @xmath14 junctions , all with left - hand end having the same @xmath12 coordinate , and all being parallel to the bias current .",
    "one such row is indicated by the dashed lines in fig .",

    "we write the equations of motion for the grain variables ( phases and charges ) .",

    "@xmath20 is the josephson coupling energy , which takes the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the josephson energy of the ( ij)@xmath23 junction , and @xmath24 is the gauge - invariant phase difference across that junction .",
    "@xmath22 is related to @xmath25 , the critical current of the ( ij)@xmath23 junction , by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the cooper pair charge .",

    "the expected positions of the sirs s [ at @xmath185 are indicated by dashed horizontal lines . indeed , the two sets of iv characteristics are very similar .",
    "this indicates that the crucial parameter is @xmath186 , not @xmath14 and @xmath132 independently .",
    "the slight extra flatness in the @xmath187 iv s probably occurs because the individual junction couplings in the @xmath188 array are @xmath189 times larger than those in the @xmath190 array .",
    "similarly , the differences in the `` retrapping current '' in the two sets of curves ( i. e. the current values below which the mccumber curve becomes unstable ) , are due to the fact that , for a given value of @xmath191 , the 2d arrays are effectively less disordered than the 1d arrays , since the _ average _ critical current for a single row has a smaller rms spread than the critical current of a single junction in a 1d array .",
    "( for other discussions of the effects of disorder , see , e. g. , refs . ) .",
    "in both the @xmath182 and the @xmath180 array of fig.[fig:10x_iv ] , the width of the sirs s varies similarly ( and non - monotonically ) with the number of active rows .",
    "this behavior distinguishes our predictions from those of some other models,@xcite where a monotonic dependence of sirs width on @xmath148 is found,@xcite and the cavity is modeled as an rlc oscillator connected in parallel to the entire array .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:10x_cav ] , the reduced time - averaged cavity energy @xmath192 is plotted vs.  @xmath193 for both arrays of fig .",
    "[ fig:10x_iv ] , under conditions such that all rows are active .",
    "this plot is obtained by following the decreasing current branch .",
    "when the @xmath182 array ( with @xmath194 ) locks on to the sirs , @xmath195 jumps to a value which is approximately two orders of magnitude _ larger _ than in the @xmath180 array , even though @xmath186 is the same for both arrays .",
    "the reason is that though the _ width _ of the steps is controlled primarily by @xmath186 , the energy in the cavity is determined by the _",
    "square _ of the number of radiating junctions , which is is _ 100 times larger _ for the 2d than the 1d array .",
    "the equations of motion described lead to a transition from incoherence to coherence , as a function of the number of active rows @xmath148 .",
    "there is also a striking effect of polarization : the transition to coherence occurs only when the cavity mode is polarized so that its electric field has a component parallel to the direction of the current flow .",
    "the numerical results closely resemble the experimental behavior,@xcite showing the following experimental features : ( i ) self - induced resonant steps ( sirs s ) in the iv characteristics ; ( ii ) a transition from incoherence to coherence above a threshold number of active junctions ; and ( iii ) a total energy in the cavity which varies quadratically with the number of active junctions when those junctions are locked onto sirs s .",
    "but there may be some differences , as discussed further in ref ..",
    "the 2d theory bears many similarities to the 1d case and elucidates why the 1d model works so well .",
    "these similarities occur because , in a square array , only junctions which are _ parallel _ to the applied current couple to the cavity .",
    "thus , as in 1d , the 2d model leads to clearly defined sirs s with voltages proportional to the cavity resonant frequency . however , there are some numerical results specific to 2d .",
    "for example , whenever one junction in a given row is biased on a sirs , _ all _ the junctions in that row phase - lock onto that same sirs .",
    "in addition , when the array is biased on a sirs , @xmath166 is much _ larger _ in 2d than in 1d , for the same value of the coupling parameter @xmath196 .",
    "a key difference between 1d and 2d is the effect of polarization : when the cavity mode is polarized perpendicular to the applied current , it does not affect the array iv characteristics .",
    "we believe that , if the array were frustrated , e.  g. by an external magnetic field normal to the plane of the array , there would be a coupling even when the cavity mode is polarized perpendicular to the current .",
    "it would be of interest to carry out calculations for the model described here , to confirm this effect .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of ways in which our model might be generalized to include some effects which are presently not taken into account .",
    "first , of course , one should include the fact that the cavity , as well as the junctions , has a finite damping ( finite @xmath197 ) .",
    "second , the real cavity fields are not spatially uniform within the array , as assumed in the calculations presented here .",
    "we speculate that the effect of these two generalizations would be to inhibit the array synchronization .",
    "third , all real cavities have more than one resonant mode ; these other modes may be relevant in some experimental circumstances .",
    "fourth , we have treated the operators as @xmath100-numbers , i. e. , have neglected quantum effects related to their non - commutativity .",
    "these quantum effects will certainly be relevant in some circumstances .",
    "finally , the present treatment of damping within individual josephson junctions is also carried out in the classical limit ( resistively and capacitively shunted josephson junction ) ; in the quantum regime where the individual junction variables need to be treated quantum - mechanically , this treatment will need to be modified .",
    "most of these generalizations can probably be carried out in a straightforward manner .",
    "thus , we believe that the present model has most of the essential physics underlying the sirs s seen in experiments . of the omitted effects , we believe that the quantum effects , if included , are most likely to produce qualitative changes , because they could lead to intriguing entanglement between quantum states of the array and of the cavity.@xcite",

    "<S> we review our previous work on the dynamics of one- and two - dimensional arrays of underdamped josephson junctions placed in a single - mode resonant cavity . starting from a well - defined model hamiltonian , which includes the effects of driving current and dissipative coupling to a heat bath , we write down the heisenberg equations of motion for the variables of the josephson junction and the cavity mode . in the limit of many photons </S>",
    "<S> , these equations reduce to coupled ordinary differential equations , which can be solved numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we present a review of some characteristic numerical results , which show many features similar to experiment . these include self - induced resonant steps ( sirs s ) at voltages @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the cavity frequency , and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is generally an integer ; a threshold number @xmath3 of active rows of junctions above which the array is coherent ; and a time - averaged cavity energy which is quadratic in the number of active junctions , when the array is above threshold . </S>",
    "<S> when the array is biased on a sirs , then , for given junction parameters , the power radiated into the array varies as the square of the number of active junctions , consistent with expectations for coherent radiation . for a given step , </S>",
    "<S> a two - dimensional array radiates much more energy into the cavity than does a one - dimensional array . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in two dimensions , we find a strong polarization effect : if the cavity mode is polarized perpendicular to the direction of current injection in a square array , then it does not couple to the array and no power is radiated into the cavity . in the presence of an applied magnetic field , however , a mode with this polarization would couple to an applied current . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that this effect might thus produce sirs s which would be absent with no applied magnetic field . </S>"
