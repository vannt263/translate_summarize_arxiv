    "let the point @xmath457 of @xmath3 connected by edges with the vertices of @xmath377 is in the plane with the unit last coordinate .",
    "then , the point @xmath458 is also a vertex .",
    "thus , the point @xmath459 is also a vertex .",
    "note that the points @xmath457 and @xmath460 are symmetric about the center of the cube : @xmath461 .",

    "therefore , the eight points do not contained in @xmath377 coincide with the following points : @xmath465    consider a lattice - regular primitive 24-sell @xmath3 and @xmath377 one of the corresponding cubes . since the edges of @xmath377 are the edges of @xmath3 , the cube @xmath377 is also primitive .",

    "straightforward calculations shows , that both resulting 24-sells are lattice - regular .    _",
    "the case of 120-sell . _",
    "the 120-sell is non - realizable as an lattice - regular lattice polytope , since its two - dimensional faces should be lattice - regular lattice pentagons . by the above",
    ", lattice - regular lattice pentagons are not realizable .    _ the case of 600-sell . _",
    "consider an arbitrary polytope with topological structure of 600-sell having one vertex at the origin @xmath50 .",

    "if the polytope @xmath3 is lattice - regular , then this symmetry is lattice - linear .",
    "since @xmath473 is the identity transformation and the space is four - dimensional , the characteristic polynomial of @xmath349 in the variable @xmath474 is either @xmath475 or @xmath476 . since @xmath477 ,",
    "the characteristic polynomial of @xmath349 is divisible by @xmath475 .",
    "if the characteristic polynomial is @xmath475 , then the operator @xmath349 is the identity operator of order 1 and not of order 5 .",
