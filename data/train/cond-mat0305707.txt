    "the absence of self - averaging in mesoscopic disordered conductors leads to important fluctuation effects in the electronic transport properties @xcite . in the metallic regime",
    ", this gives rise to the universal conductance fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in this regime , for a given strength of macroscopic disorder , the probability distribution @xmath0 of the dimensionless conductance @xmath4 ( in units of @xmath5 ) , for all possible microscopic distributions of randomness , is a gaussian with a universal variance _",
    "i.e. _ its value does not depend on microscopic details of the sample but depends on the symmetry of the system only . with sufficiently large disorder however , the moments of the conductance fluctuations can become of the same order of magnitude as the average conductance , and therefore the average value becomes insufficient in describing the statistical properties of the conductor . in the extreme case of the deeply insulating regime , @xmath0 becomes log - normal , which means that it has a very long tail so that its mean value is very different from the most probable value . thus for all strengths of disorder beyond the metallic regime , one must consider the full distribution of conductances . in particular , a very broad distribution may change the qualitative nature of the anderson transition , the metal to insulator transition at zero temperature even in the absence of electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "the numerically obtained @xmath0 at critical disorder for the three dimensional ( 3d ) anderson transition is indeed very broad and highly asymmetric @xcite .",
    "the conductance at the integer quantum hall transition is also expected to have a very broad , almost flat , distribution @xcite .",
    "there is no theoretical method currently available to obtain directly the full distribution of conductances for all strengths of disorder in arbitrary dimensions @xcite .",
    "moments of the distribution have been calculated in dimension @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xcite within the supersymmetric non - linear sigma model framework @xcite but the critical distribution obtained from the moments @xcite in @xmath6 differ qualitatively from the numerically obtained @xmath0 in 3d . in the present work we will consider the distribution of conductances for the simpler case of a quasi one dimensional ( quasi 1d ) wire , for which the width @xmath8 is smaller than the elastic mean free path @xmath9 , and much smaller than its length @xmath10 .",
    "although such a system has no phase transition , it has well defined metallic and insulating regimes , and a smooth crossover between them .",
    "the distribution in the crossover regime , where the localization length is of the order of the system size , should give a reasonably good qualitative picture of the distribution near the critical regime in higher dimensions , where the localization length diverges and becomes of the order of the system size .",
    "even for this simple quasi 1d geometry , only the first two moments of @xmath0 have been obtained for all strengths of disorder @xcite , using the non - linear sigma model .",
    "numerical as well as experimental @xcite results show a broad asymmetric distribution qualitatively similar to 3d .",
    "we will use a scattering approach in which the conductance is given in terms of the transmission eigenvalues @xmath11 of a finite conductor sandwiched between two ideal leads @xcite .",
    "the finite width of the lead quantizes the perpendicular momenta into @xmath12 values , providing @xmath12 channels of scattering and therefore @xmath12 number of transmission levels .",
    "the dimensionless conductance @xmath4 is simply given by the total transmission probability @xmath13 the statistics of these levels as a function of the length @xmath14 of the conductor is described by the dorokhov - mello - pereyra - kumar ( dmpk ) equation @xcite .",
    "this equation has been shown @xcite to be equivalent to the non - linear sigma model @xcite obtained from the microscopic tight binding anderson model , where electrons hop to neighboring sites that have random energies chosen from a uniform distribution .",
    "an advantage of using the dmpk equation is that its solution _ i.e. _ the joint probability distribution ( jpd ) of all the transmission eigenvalues is known @xcite and since the conductance is simply related to these eigenvalues , it is possible to write down the full distribution of conductances .",
    "the major problem is that the jpd involves @xmath12 constrained integrals for the @xmath12 eigenvalues , and that we would be interested in the case of a large number of transmission eigenvalues .",
    "we have developed a simple systematic method , valid for _ all strengths of disorder _ , to evaluate analytically the full distribution of conductance for a quasi 1d wire , starting from the solution of the dmpk equation .",
    "for simplicity , we restrict our calculation mostly to the unitary symmetry case where time reversal symmetry is broken , _ e.g. _ by the application of a magnetic field .",
    "the method is valid for other symmetry classes also , and we will discuss extension of the calculation to these cases as well . as a check of the essential framework , we will show analytically that the method reproduces the known exact results for the mean , variance as well as the distribution of the conductances in both the metallic and insulating limits .",
    "we will also compute the leading correction to the mean conductance in the metallic regime , which agrees very well with the exact value obtained in @xcite . since the leading order correction to the variance vanishes for the unitary symmetry class",
    ", we will evaluate it for the other two symmetry classes ; again the results agree very well with the exact results .",
    "also , it has already been shown in @xcite that the mean and the variance as a function of disorder obtained within the method agrees qualitatively well with exact results for all strengths of disorder including the crossover regime .",
    "some of the novel features of the distribution obtained within our method have been reported earlier @xcite . here",
    "we discuss details which provide insights about the rare but allowed configurations of the transmission eigenvalues obtained from the method and allow us to study these features . in particular , we provide details that led to the prediction of a ` one - sided ' log - normal distribution near the crossover regime in @xcite , the changes in the shape of the distribution across the crossover regime obtained in @xcite as well as the non - analyticity in the distribution near @xmath1 predicted in @xcite .",
    "we also show for the first time within dmpk that while for metals the distribution is a gaussian around @xmath2 , there exists a long non - gaussian tail for @xmath15 , consistent with earlier field theoretic calculations @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ dmpk ]",
    "we review the dmpk equation and its general solution . in section [ saddlepoint ]",
    "we introduce the basic strategy of our new approach which is used to evaluate @xmath0 from the jpd of the @xmath11 for all strengths of disorder in terms of certain saddle point free energies .",
    "our method is based on separating out an appropriate number of discrete eigenvalues and treating the rest as a continuum . for simplicity ,",
    "we start with separating out only one eigenvalue in section [ saddlepoint ] . in section [ free - energy ]",
    "we obtain explicit forms for the density of the continuum and various free energy terms . in this section",
    "we also discuss some of the special features in the density and their implications for the distribution . in section [ metallic ]",
    "we focus on the metallic regime and obtain several analytical results and compare them with known exact results .",
    "we also obtain the non - gaussian tail of the distribution . in section [ insulating ]",
    "we obtain approximate analytic expressions for the distribution in the insulating and crossover regimes based on the separation of one eigenvalue . in section [ 2eigen ]",
    "we extend our formulation by separating out two eigenvalues , which have been used to obtain the non - analyticity in @xmath0 near @xmath1 and also to evaluate the distribution across the crossover regime . in section [ betadif2 ]",
    "we briefly discuss the case of other symmetries , and obtain corrections to the mean and variance of @xmath4 and compare them with known exact results .",

    "the @xmath27 are very close to each other so that a continuum description can be used with a density of @xmath46 points finite between zero and an upper cutoff given by the normalization condition . strictly speaking , eq .",
    "( [ poflambda ] ) is valid only for @xmath47 @xcite , but this approximation works well in the metallic regime . within a global maximum entropy ansatz , such a continuum approximation was used @xcite to show the relevance of a wigner - dyson like random matrix ensemble @xcite for the transmission levels . the density of levels obtained from the dmpk solution within such a continuum approximation yields the correct value of the mean and the variance in the metallic regime @xcite , known from diagrammatic perturbation theory @xcite . in the deeply insulating regime on the other hand , all @xmath27 are exponentially large and separated exponentially from each other , and conductance is dominated by the smallest eigenvalue .",
    "this approximation yields the log - normal distribution of the conductance in the deeply insulating regime @xcite .",
    "it is clear however that none of the above descriptions can be used in the crossover regime , where the smallest eigenvalue is neither zero , nor exponentially large .",
    "our approach combines the essential features of the two descriptions and provides a simple and systematic procedure to study the conductance distribution @xmath0 at all strengths of disorder .",

    "the basic idea of our method is to first separate out an appropriate number of the lowest eigenvalues , and treat the rest as a continuum by introducing a density for those eigenvalues . in @xcite",
    "a single eigenvalue was separated out , which was sufficient to obtain the qualitative nature of @xmath0 in the metallic regime , in the crossover region on the insulating side as well as deep in the insulating regime . in @xcite ,",
    "the importance of separating at least two eigenvalues in order to study the crossover region quantitatively was emphasized .",
    "however here we will consider in detail the case of separating out one eigenvalue in the metallic regime since it allows us to obtain many of our results analytically , which provides much insight into the nature of the solutions , and two eigenvalues in the crossover and insulating regimes where it becomes essential .",
    "the ` density ' of the continuum , including the source term , is obtained following dyson @xcite by minimizing the free energy functional , which then yields a saddle point free energy .",
    "the qualitative nature of the density gives important information about the problem and will not only provide guidelines for appropriate approximations , but will also suggest novel possibilities in the distribution .",
    "we will see that at least for @xmath22 , the @xmath52 dependence of @xmath53 is only quadratic , so the integral over @xmath52 in ( 10 ) can be done exactly .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath0 is then reduced to two integrals in the metallic regime and three integrals in the crossover and insulating regimes , over all possible positions of the separated discrete levels , as well as over the beginning of the continuum .",
    "these integrals can then be done approximately analytically in some limiting cases to obtain qualitative results , or numerically to obtain quantitative results for comparison with direct numerical simulations .",
    "while we will mainly restrict our considerations to the case @xmath22 only , we would point out the results for other values of @xmath20 whenever they can be obtained without too much difficulty .    in the following",

    "the method is based on the mapping of the @xmath12 eigenvalues to an electrostatic problem of @xmath12 charges on the positive line with one- and two - body interactions . instead of treating all the charges as part of a continuum in the @xmath75 limit",
    ", we introduce the idea of separating out a finite number of charges close to the origin ( corresponding to the most conducting channels ) and treating the rest as a continuum .",
    "this allows us to treat the strong disorder region as well where the continuum model breaks down due to the large separation between the charges , and where a finite number of discrete charges give a better description .",
    "while the set of discrete charges are treated exactly , the continuum part is treated within a saddle point approximation to obtain a saddle point free energy , from which all the relevant transport quantities are evaluated .",
    "the saddle point density of the continuum and its relation to the set of discrete charges show how the nature of the solution changes qualitatively with increasing disorder , and allows us to look for rare but allowed configurations that give rise to novel characteristics of the distribution .",
    "while two such characteristics , namely the existence of non - analyticity near @xmath1 and the resulting asymmetry in the distribution have been reported earlier , we show here for the first time within the same framework that there exists a log - normal tail in @xmath0 for @xmath15 even for weak disorder where the average @xmath2 , consistent with earlier field theory calculations . in order to check the accuracy of our method",
    ", we also obtain several other results in the metallic limit for which exact results are available .",
    "these include the average and the variance of conductance to order @xmath285 for all symmetry classes and the difference in the saddle point density between different symmetry classes .",
    "the method developed here is very general and can be applied to other quantities as well , _",
    "e.g. _ the study of the distribution of shot noise as well as the conductance distribution in the presence of andreev scattering in an ns ( normal metal - superconductor ) junction .",
    "one should keep in mind that the dmpk approach does not contain the effects of wave function correlations in the transverse direction , which are expected to be important in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the novel features in @xmath0 near @xmath1 within our framework appears under very robust conditions which are independent of dimensionality .",
    "it is therefore possible that some of the features will persist in higher dimensions as well .",
    "the similarities of the shape of @xmath0 in the crossover regime obtained within the current framework with the numerically determined @xmath0 in 3d at the critical point appears to be consistent with the above conjecture .",
    "this work has been supported in part by sfb 195 and by the center for functional nanostructures of the der deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft .",
    "p.w . acknowledges support through a max - planck research award .",
    "v. a. g. is grateful for hospitality at the ipcms - gemme , strasbourg ( france ) where part of this work was done .",
    "in the following we give some details of the calculations for the partial densities mentioned in sec .",
    "it is convenient to define the integral : @xmath438 then the partial density @xmath439 is given by @xmath440",
    "here we give some details for the deduction of the relation ( 65 ) .",
    "as we mentioned , in general the integral ( 64 ) is of the form @xmath655 in the regime @xmath109 , we can expand @xmath656 as @xmath657 , where @xmath658 is independent of @xmath108 . therefore the determinant can be also expanded as @xmath659 .",
    "$ ] the first term is independent of @xmath108 , and only contributes to the normalization .",
    "the second part can be written as @xmath660 $ ] expanding the logarithm , it is clear that the correction to the free energy is going to be proportional to @xmath108 , and the proportionality constant is small because the dominant metallic contributions come from the @xmath658 part and @xmath661 is a small correction . since all other terms in the free energy in the metallic limit are of order @xmath662 , the fluctuation corrections for the functional integral are in general negligible .",
    "however , our saddle point density goes to zero at the lower limit @xmath209 .",
    "it is approximately constant , equal to @xmath37 , for large @xmath213 .",
    "the scale over which it changes is @xmath663 . in general , for the saddle point value of @xmath158 less than the width of the peak in @xmath656 vs @xmath158 , the lower limit of @xmath664 will matter .",
    "for example , in the extreme case where the saddle point @xmath665 , the integral over @xmath158 would only give 1/2 the full value .",
    "we can not evaluate this correction explicitly , but we only need the @xmath215 and @xmath108 dependent contributions , which we can estimate .",
    "let us consider the region of integral over @xmath143 up to some constant @xmath68 times @xmath666 , which is the scale beyond which the @xmath213 dependence becomes negligible .",
    "this is the part where the correction comes from .",
    "the integral @xmath667 will have a contribution coming from the exponent @xmath668 we scale out the @xmath457 from the limit by changing variables @xmath669 , @xmath670 which leads to @xmath671 where we defined @xmath672 since @xmath656 is logarithmic in @xmath143 for small @xmath143 , the change of variables will produce a @xmath673 term , plus terms independent of @xmath46 . expand @xmath674 such that @xmath675 , where @xmath676 it is now clear that if @xmath677 is the dominant part , then only @xmath678 part is non - zero because the integral is proportional to terms like @xmath679 . in other words , @xmath680 ,",
    "where @xmath681 .",
    "then we can write @xmath682 since @xmath683 .",
    "( the correction will again be powers of @xmath46 ) . in the free energy , this gives a contribution ( eq .",
    "65 ) @xmath684 note that because of the logarithm , the coefficient of the @xmath685 term is one - half , despite all the approximations .",
    "the term appears simply from the scaling of the original variable , which was determined by the form of the diverging part of @xmath686 which sets the scale over which the saddle point density becomes independent of @xmath213 near the origin .",
    "note also that for @xmath687 , the density no longer has a dip at @xmath209 , and the correction vanishes .",
    "thus it will be relevant only in the metallic limit .",
