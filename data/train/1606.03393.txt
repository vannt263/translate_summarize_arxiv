    "many - particle perturbation theory and its graphical representation through the feynman diagrammatics is particularly suited for the description of problems in quantum electrodynamics ( qed)@xcite , due to the natural identification of a small parameter for the perturbative expansion , the fine structure constant @xmath1 . despite significant formal similarities , the situation is conceptually different for the feynman diagrammatics of many electron systems in condensed matter . here",
    "the bare coulomb interaction between electrons and/or between electrons and ions does not define _ per se _ a small scale with respect to the electronic bandwidth .",
    "thus , the applicability of perturbation expansions for several classes of materials is only justified because of the efficiency of electronic density fluctuations in screening the bare coulomb interaction : this is , ultimately , the microscopic reason behind the success of the landau fermi liquid ( fl)@xcite description of metals and of the @xmath2@xcite approach for semiconductors . for the same reason , however , in all cases where electronic screening works poorly , such as , e.g. , for the electrons of @xmath3 and @xmath4 transition metal oxides , a _ breakdown _ of the perturbation expansion must be expected .    in spite of the importance of the phenomena occurring in these systems , ranging from mott - hubbard metal - insulator transitions ( mits)@xcite , to unconventional superconductivity@xcite , quantum criticality@xcite , emergence of kinks in spectral functions@xcite and specific heat@xcite , etc . , only little is known about _ how _ the breakdown of the many - electron perturbation expansion actually manifests itself in the corresponding feynman diagrammatics and _ how _ it is reflected in physical observables .",
    "this is far from being a merely academic issue , because many@xcite of the cutting edge approaches recently developed to treat strongly correlated electrons in finite ( three or two dimensional ) systems largely exploit the feynman diagrammatics and/or the luttinger - ward functional formalism .",
    "first specific reports about unexpected theoretical consequences induced by the breakdown of the many - body perturbation expansion have been recently presented by several groups .",
    "such effects range from the occurrence@xcite of low - frequency divergences of two - particle irreducible vertex functions in the hubbard@xcite and falicov - kimball@xcite models to the multivaluedness@xcite of the electronic self - energy expressed as a functional of the ( interacting ) green s function or , equivalently , of the luttinger - ward functional .",
    "all these manifestations of non - perturbativeness are interconnected and represent different aspects of the same problem , as suggested in some of the abovementioned works .    in this paper , we aim at making progress towards a full understanding of such perturbation - theory breakdowns , by analyzing their several manifestations , mutual interplays , and physical meanings . for this goal",

    "[ ] , where , by applying the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite , singularities in the bethe - salpeter equations ( and , thus , divergencies in the corresponding irreducible vertex functions ) were found in the case of the single - band hubbard and falicov - kimball models .",
    "more precisely , it was demonstrated that the local generalized susceptibility @xmath5 , associated with the auxiliary anderson impurity model ( aim ) of the dmft self - consistent solution , becomes a singular ( i.e. , not invertible ) matrix in the ( fermionic ) matsubara frequency space .",
    "this induces a divergence in the irreducible vertex @xmath6 , defined by the inversion of the corresponding local bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "such singularities were found in the charge ( as well as particle - particle ) scattering channel(s ) of the fk ( hubbard ) model , defining one ( two ) lines in their phase - diagrams . remarkably , for both models , the minimal values of the bare local coulomb interaction @xmath7 where the singularities appear are , at low temperatures , significantly _",
    "lower _ than those for which the mit is found in dmft , i.e. , they occur well inside the metallic phase of the models .",
    "it is worth noticing that the occurrence of analogous divergences has been recently reported@xcite also for the case of dynamical cluster approximation calculations ( dca)@xcite for the two - dimensional hubbard model , demonstrating that their presence can not be ascribed to artifacts of the purely local physics described by dmft .",
    "because of the intrinsic complexity of the subject , in this work we adopt the following strategy : we will analyze systematically , by means of dmft , the occurrence of singularities in the generalized susceptibilities of different model systems , where the correlated physics is introduced progressively , until , eventually , the full complexity of the hubbard hamiltonian is recovered .",
    "in particular , we will consider the cases of ( i ) disordered binary mixture ( bm ) and falicov - kimball ( fk ) models , where correlation effects are effectively induced by averaging over the impurity configurations , ( ii ) the atomic limit ( al ) of the hubbard model and ( iii ) the hubbard model itself .",
    "this way , we exploit the opportunity of treating analytically several aspects of the divergences occurring in the simplified situations to gain a general understanding of their properties and mutual relations , such as their connection to the recently found multivaluedness of the luttinger - ward functional .",
    "in particular , we will demonstrate that frequency - localized divergences are associated with an underlying , unique , energy scale @xmath8 , while this is not the case for the non - localized singularities .",

    "furthermore , the values listed in red / orange on the right - hand side of fig .  [ fig : pd ] are the ratios @xmath392 for which the irreducible vertices in the al diverge ( see sec . [",
    "sec : atomic ] ) : it can be seen that the slopes of the extrapolated divergence lines of @xmath118 and @xmath385 of dmft coincide with the corresponding ratios in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ratio ] ) for @xmath393 and eq .",
    "( [ equ : div2cond ] ) for the smallest solution of this ( transcendental ) equation .",
    "thus , the extension of the work of ref .   results in a highly non - trivial divergence phase - diagram for the hubbard model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] ) , as the two lines already reported in ref .",
    "are evidently not the _ only _ ones where a vertex divergence takes place . by approaching the mit from the metallic phase",
    ", one observes several eigenvalues of the generalized charge and particle - particle susceptibilities progressively passing through zero ( `` singular '' eigenvalues ) at certain values of @xmath394 .",
    "these determine the corresponding divergences of the irreducible vertices as well as a sign change of their low - frequency structure on the two sides of the divergence line@xcite .",
    "their positions in the phase diagram are marked -in the usual notation- by red and orange lines . by moving further into the non - perturbative parameter regime ,",
    "because of the high density of divergence lines , the extraction of the irreducible vertex functions becomes more challenging , and we could determine with sufficient numerical accuracy only the first seven divergences of @xmath118 and @xmath385 .",
    "however , by exploiting the one - to - one large-@xmath7 correspondence of the divergence lines in the hubbard phase diagram with the infinitely many divergences of the exact atomic limit solution ( see sec .",
    "iv and rightmost scale in fig  .[fig : pd ] ) , we can infer a presence of an _ infinite _ number of ( red and orange ) divergence lines over the whole phase diagram .",
    "finally , we should also remark that the irreducible vertex in the ( predominant ) spin channel @xmath395 does not exhibit any low - frequency divergences in the whole parameter region considered .",
    "as for the low - temperature regime ( @xmath396 ) , the numerical treatment becomes significantly harder .",
    "hence , in addition to hf - qmc , we have performed ct - qmc calculations in the hybridization expansion@xcite .",
    "the latter does not suffer from the finite - size problems , neither the ones of ed ( bath discretization ) nor the ones of hf - qmc ( trotter time - discretization ) , and can more easily access lower temperatures .",
    "let us however note that if a qualitative change in the shape of the divergence lines would take place at exponentially small temperature scales , even the ct - qmc analysis might miss it .",
    "the presence of an exponentially small temperature scale characterizes for instance the physics of some multi - orbital models @xcite , for which the fermi - liquid coherence temperature @xcite could not be reached by ct - qmc calculations .",
    "bearing these limitations in mind , the results for the first two divergence lines are compatible with a @xmath397 extrapolation of @xmath398 and @xmath399 , respectively ( for details about the low - temperature data see appendix  [ app : lowt ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : lowt ] and [ fig : bethe ] therein ) : in both cases @xmath400 of the mit , and , therefore , the line terminates well inside the metallic regime , where a well defined , coherent quasi - particle peak is visible in the dmft spectral functions .",
    "looking at our divergence results for the whole phase diagram , one will ",
    "first of all  find a confirmation for the heuristic interpretation proposed in ref .   of the irreducible vertex singularities as _ non - perturbative precursors _ of the mott - hubbard transition , linked@xcite to a gradual suppression of the physical charge susceptibility and the opening of a spectral gap when approaching the mit .",
    "besides this rather generic consideration , however , it remains a problem to gain deeper understanding of the origin of this impressive manifestation of the breakdown of perturbation theory around the mit , of its interrelation with other theoretical aspects of the non - perturbative physics , and  if they exist  of its effects in observable quantities .",
    "to this aim , in the next subsection , we will proceed by performing a detailed comparison of the hubbard model data of fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] ( right panel ) with those of simplified models reported in secs .",
    "iii - iv .      despite the high degree of complexity displayed by the many vertex divergence lines surrounding the mit of the hubbard model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] , right panel ) , these can be classified  in a large portion of the phase diagram  in a similar , simple framework like that of the disordered / atomic - limit model .",
    "in particular , by comparing our results for the hubbard model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] , right panel ) with those of the disordered models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] , left panel ) and of the atomic limit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] , rightmost scale ) , we note immediately a qualitatively similar behavior of both ( red and orange ) kind of divergence lines in all three cases in the region of large @xmath7 and @xmath75 .",
    "this corresponds to the parameter region , where the relation between @xmath389 and @xmath401 is approximately linear in the hubbard model . on the other hand , by following the divergence lines towards the low-@xmath75 regime , one observes _",
    "two _ relevant discrepancies , between the the hubbard and the bm / fk / atomic results : ( i ) an evident re - entrance is displayed by all the lines , ( ii ) the divergence lines do no longer accumulate at a unique point in the @xmath402 region ( hubbard model ) . +",
    "this twofold outcome of the visual comparison between the phase - diagrams of sec .  v and secs .",
    "iii - iv ( disordered models , al ) is also supported , quantitatively , by the analysis of the evolution of the singular eigenvector @xmath319 along the divergence lines . for the sake of conciseness , we discuss here the frequency structure of the eigenvector corresponding to the first ( red ) divergence line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] ( right panel ) . specifically , fig .",
    "[ fig : ev_d ] shows the evolution of the singular eigenvector ( associated with a zero eigenvalue@xcite ) of @xmath403 by reducing gradually the value of @xmath7 and @xmath75 from the strong - coupling / high-@xmath75 limit , following the first divergence line of @xmath404 .",
    "one immediately notices that , within the region where the divergence curve in the phase diagram can be approximated well by a straight line , the frequency shape of eigenvector of @xmath403 is very close to the purely frequency - localized form of eqs .",
    "( [ equ : eigv ] ) and ( [ equ : eval ] ) .",
    "this means that its frequency shape is exactly the same of the singular eigenvector identifying the first ( red ) divergence line in the bm / fk and atomic limit phase - diagrams .    on the other hand , for lower temperatures",
    ", the frequency structure of @xmath319 in the hubbard model deviates from the delta - peaked one of eqs .",
    "( [ equ : eigv ] ) and ( [ equ : eval ] ) .",
    "in particular , the discrepancy gets progressively larger by decreasing ( @xmath405 ) and starts to become appreciable in correspondence to the re - entrance of the curve in the phase - diagram .",
    "this marks evidently a qualitative difference w.r.t .",
    "the bm / fk / atomic case , where the frequency - structure of @xmath319 does not change along the entire ( red ) divergence lines .    on the basis of the above comparisons , a precise insight into the divergences occurring in the large @xmath7 region of the hubbard model can readily be gained . there , the shape of the lines and the frequency structure of the corresponding singular eigenvector are the same as in the bm / fk / atomic model .",
    "this means that the same scenario applies as in those cases : each ( red ) divergence line can be associated with a fixed matsubara frequency , @xmath406 , and all of them will be ( almost perfectly ) collapsing to a _",
    "unique _ line via a rescaling factor equal to the corresponding matsubara index @xmath113 .",
    "we deduce , as a consequence , that the multiple divergence lines in the large ( @xmath7,@xmath75 ) limit of the hubbard model are also a manifestation of an underlying _ single _ energy scale @xmath281 .",
    "the latter will be well approximated in this regime by the corresponding atomic limit expression , given in eq .",
    "( [ equ : scaleal ] ) , which also implies -to a large extent- that all consideration made about the multivaluedness of @xmath96 $ ] ( and of the related luttinger - ward functional ) are also applicable here .",
    "somewhat similar considerations can be drawn also for the second kind of divergences ( orange lines ) , which for large @xmath7 and @xmath75 resembles in many respects , the corresponding divergences of second kind in the fk model / atomic limit : in both cases , they always occur after the divergences of first kind , they are associated with a non - localized singular eigenvector , and , thus , appear as global divergences of the whole irreducible vertex functions at each pair of fermionic matsubara frequencies @xmath45 and @xmath46 . however , as already noted in sec .",
    "iii  b , in the hubbard model , as well as in the atomic limit , such divergences of second kind occur simultaneously in _ two channels _ , while they were confined to the particle - hole sector in the case of the fk model .",
    "( see also footnote ) associated with the first zero eigenvalue for different temperatures along the first divergence line of fig .",
    "[ fig : pd].,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the theoretical interpretation becomes obviously more challenging in the low-@xmath75 regime , where all the divergence lines display a pronounced bending in the hubbard - phase diagram : here , our numerical results for the hubbard model deviate qualitatively from those of the bm / fk / atomic case .",
    "thus , we can not certainly invoke the same scenario as in the large ( @xmath7,@xmath75 ) limit .",
    "this low-@xmath75 regime , on the other hand , is one of the most interesting in the dmft phase - diagram of the hubbard model : it corresponds to the correlated metallic phase on the left - side of the mott - hubbard mit , whose low - energy physics is ",
    "differently from the case of bm / fk / atomic - limit  dominated by the presence of a narrow coherent quasiparticle ( kondo ) peak . in particular , an important question naturally arises about the persistence of low - energy excitations of ( supposed ) fermi - liquid nature in a parameter regime where the perturbation theory breakdown has already taken place , as signaled by the presence of several divergence lines . in other words ,",
    "the question is , how the highly _ non - perturbative _ divergences which we found for @xmath407 can coexist -for the same parameters- with an essentially fermi - liquid - like physics at low energy ? does a non - perturbative fermi liquid exist ? or was the assumption of having fermi - liquid excitations for all @xmath408 ( at @xmath108 ) not fully correct ?    because of the lack of analytic expressions for the vertex divergences and for the associated singular eigenvector in this regime , we can not rigorously answer these questions yet .",
    "however , the discrepancies we observe w.r.t .",
    "the fk / bm case are already suggesting possible alternative scenarios .",
    "if we focus , for the sake of simplicity , on the first kind of ( red ) divergence lines , we note that the condition ensuring the existence a _",
    "single _ energy scale @xmath0 below which the self - energy becomes _ non - perturbative _",
    ", i.e. a pure locality of the singular eigenvector ( see sec .",
    "iii ) , is progressively violated by reducing @xmath75 and @xmath7 .",
    "hence , the existence of an single underlying @xmath281 , such as that shown in the inset of fig .  [ fig : phase_diagram_fk ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram_al ] , should be disregarded in the correlated metallic regime of the hubbard model .",
    "in fact , we note that the presence of such a scale would have been particularly hard to reconcile with the fermi - liquid nature of the low - frequency self - energy in this parameter regime .    speculating further on these considerations , one of the simplest scenarios to be considered may be the following : by increasing @xmath7 the breakdown of perturbation theory can not happen as in the bm / fk / atomic limit cases starting from the low energy sector ( i.e. , from @xmath409 at @xmath410 ) , because the perturbative nature of such a sector must be somewhat `` protected '' by the quasi - particle peak excitations . in the dmft for the hubbard model",
    ", such protection would occur through a kondo screening of the auxiliary aim , evidently missing in the other model cases ( bm , fk , atomic - limit ) .",
    "however , nothing would prevent a perturbative breakdown to occur initially at finite real frequencies at a given @xmath389 , where the first divergence is found , and then to gradually extend its influence towards lower and higher frequencies . in this scenario , at @xmath108 only at @xmath411 , i.e. , at the mit , the non - perturbative features of finite frequency would eventually reach the fermi level . then , only when the qp excitations are gone , the underlying scenario would become again similar to the one described in secs .",
    "iii - iv . at the same time , the apparent contradiction of observing a fermi - liquid behavior in a non - perturbative regime , would be solved by the fact that the low - frequency / low - energy region would remain perturbative until the mit occurs .",
    "obviously , it is at the moment unclear how the _ two _ energy scales can be formally related to the vertex divergences in matsubara space .    while a detailed study of the realization of the abovementioned scenario , or of even more complicated ones , is beyond the scopes of the present work , it is important to notice that some hints for the existence of an intermediate scale for the occurrence of non - perturbative features in the strongly correlated metal described by dmft might already be traced in some of the peculiar spectral and transport - property features of the dmft solution for the half - filled hubbard model . here",
    ", we are referring to the occurrence of kinks@xcite in the spectral function and in the specific heat .",
    "such kinks , in fact , appear at finite frequency and temperature , precisely in the correlated metallic regime of the hubbard model , where the irreducible vertex divergences are also found . in particular , within a scenario with two energy scales , one could suppose that the lowest one might be associated with the kink energy , as both of them would vanish exactly at the mit .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a systematic quantum many - body investigation of the divergences of the irreducible vertex functions , which represent _ one _ of the several manifestations of the perturbation - expansion breakdown in correlated electron theory . by considering the intrinsically non - perturbative dmft solutions for correlated electronic hamiltonians of increasing complexity ( from the disordered bm and fk , over the atomic limit case to the hubbard model ) , we were able to extend significantly the results of previous studies@xcite .",
    "in particular , exploiting the analytical derivations for the disordered / atomic limit cases , we could : ( i ) demonstrate the existence of _ infinitely _ many divergences in all phase - diagrams of the models considered ; ( ii ) classify these divergences in terms of the ( frequency localized / not localized ) properties of the corresponding singular eigenvectors and of the existence of a _ single _ underlying energy scale , delimiting the frequency range affected by non - perturbative features ; ( iii ) precisely demonstrate the link of the vertex divergences to other manifestations of the perturbation - theory breakdown , such as the multivaluedness of the self - energy ( and , hence , of the luttinger - ward ) functionals .",
    "all these findings apply to a certain extent also to the _ infinitely _ many divergences lines of the phase - diagram of the hubbard model , at least in the strong - coupling , high-@xmath75 regime , and provide possible interpretative keys for the most interesting region of the hubbard dmft phase diagram , the low-@xmath75 strongly correlated metallic regime . there , the qualitative modification of the frequency dependence of the singular eigenvectors seems to preclude the explanation in terms of a unique energy scale , marking the most important discrepancy w.r.t .",
    "the physics of the disordered / atomic - limit models .",
    "we ascribe this difference to the presence of a coherent quasi - particle peak in the dmft spectral functions of this parameter regime : the kondo screening at work in the auxiliary aim of dmft should `` protect '' the low - frequency physics from the non - perturbative divergences , and allows for the stabilization of the fermi - liquid physics in dmft solutions until the mott - hubbard mit is reached .",
    "however , as nothing prohibits the non - perturbative breakdown to first manifest at _ finite _ frequencies ( where kondo screening work less effectively ) in the hubbard model case , we speculate that a minimal model with at least _ two _ characteristic energy scales might capture the essence of the irreducible vertex divergences in the hubbard model .",
    "the lower one of such energy scales might be then related to the finite - energy kinks , whose emergences have been demonstrated in the same correlated metallic regime of our interest .",
    "the progress in the understanding of the non - perturbative physics and its several manifestation in quantum many - body theory , as reported in this paper , is of possible impact in different respects and potentially inspiring for future studies . in particular , from a more algorithmic perspective , the discussion of the validity of the feynman diagrammatics in non - perturbative regime can play a central role in the future developments of diagrammatic extensions of dmft .",
    "particularly important information is encoded in the fact that the multiple irreducible vertex divergence lines can be the simple manifestation of an _ single _ energy scale , and that these divergences are _ never _ appearing in the full scattering amplitude @xmath383 , but that  at the same time ",
    "they are rooted down to the most fundamental building - block of the parquet equations , the fully two - particle irreducible vertex function . also of importance , especially for the bold diagrammatic qmc algorithms , is the definition of the frequency / energy range , controlled by non - perturbative effects , where the standard resummation of diagrammatic ( skeleton ) series can lead to unphysical results .    as for the physics , our combined analysis of different disordered and the hubbard models , support the proposed@xcite interpretation of the occurrence of irreducible vertex divergences as _ non - perturbative precursors _ of the mott mit in correlated systems . in the case of different distributed disordered models , in fact ,",
    "the absence of the mit determines the disappearance of all vertex divergences . as for the hubbard model ,",
    "moreover , the mott - hubbard mit can not be reached from the perturbative regime without crossing several divergence lines ( the exact number likely depending on the model details ) . in general , the divergences of the vertex functions appear to be triggered by a separation of energy scales , which , in the model considered , freezes the charge fluctuations and leads ultimately to the opening of a spectral gap .",
    "our understanding of the highly non - perturbative features of the mit physics , however , is far from being complete for the case of the hubbard model , where the quasi - particle physics most likely competes with the reduction of charge fluctuations at low frequencies .",
    "hence , further effort should be made in this direction , possibly further combining information extracted by analytic and numerical calculations .",
    "eventually , extensions to include the effect of non - local correlations and interactions , e.g. , by means of the dynamical cluster approximation and the edmft should be also considered . in the former case",
    ", the recently proposed relation of the vertex divergences with the formation of an rvb cluster state and pseudogap spectral features @xcite might be tested against the existence of _ infinitely _ many divergence lines and the existence of different non - perturbative energy scales for different momenta at the fermi level . in the latter case",
    ", we expect that systems with long - range interactions might indeed display qualitatively similar divergence features .",
    "a full understanding of all non - perturbative aspects@xcite of the ( non - relativistic ) quantum many - body theory will certainly require considerable additional efforts .",
    "these efforts might be , however , highly rewarding in the perspective of gaining the total control of the theory of correlated electron systems in their most elusive , but phenomenologically interesting , parameter regions .",
