    "reciprocal space maps could subsequently be extracted .",
    "the x - ray energy was 17  kev and the x - ray incidence angle was kept constant to ensure a homogeneous footprint .",
    "the sample temperature was controlled using a nitrogen cryojet , and the transition temperatures were in agreement with magnetization measurements .",
    "the sample was initially oriented in the aus phase , and the resulting orientation matrix was used as reference when cooling to the mt phase .    in  [ figrsm_t2 ]",
    "we show reciprocal space maps through the @xmath65 reflection as the sample is cooled from 408  k to 290  k. as the temperature is lowered we first ( t=372  k and 356  k ) see the appearance of the satellite reflections from the pre - martensite phase @xcite , which has a modulation wavevector of @xmath9 $ ] with @xmath66 . as the mt transition is reached ( t = 356  k and 335  k ) the regular lattice peak is split and several bragg reflections corresponding to different mt twins can be seen , though none coincide exactly with the shown lattice plane .",

    "the intensity of these peaks are independent of temperature ( t = 315 and 290  k ) and are clearly not located exactly on the [ 01@xmath67@xmath68 rod . ]    to identify the satellite reflections from the structural modulation of the mt phase , a cut has to be made between two mt peaks corresponding to the same twin .",
    "one example of such a reciprocal space map can be seen in  [ figctr2 ] .",
    "it shows a cut including the @xmath69_{mt}$ ] and @xmath70_{mt}$ ] peaks corresponding to a single structural twin and can be used to identify the many satellite reflections located exactly between them .",
    "in  [ figmod1 ] we show an example of a line scan along such a rod .",
    "we note that this scan is representative , that is , if there are any satellite reflections between two bragg reflections corresponding to a single twin , we observe exactly these peaks .",
    "this structure is somewhat similar to scans published by @xcite , where they attributed it to a 7 m structure .",
    "we observe the following concerning the location of the satellite reflections .",
    "first , all peaks appear modulo 2 r.l.u . and in pairs at @xmath71 from the main reflections .",
    "in addition they are not placed at periodic intervals between the reflections with the main reflections occurring at @xmath72 .",
    "this is significantly different from the incommensurately modulated structure known from stochiometric ni@xmath0mnga @xcite and it is not consistent with the typical 5 m or 7 m phases in any of their manifestations .",
    "the symmetric reflections indicate a periodic modulation along the \\{110 } axes of the sample , but the different deviations @xmath73 indicate that more than a single modulation period exists .",
    "in fact , the observed reflections are consistent with two wavevectors with @xmath74 and 0.51 .",
    "two such modulations will result in peaks at any combination of the modulation vectors , explaining the observed reflection at 0.83 ( within the measurement precision ) . to test this",
    "we calculate the scattering from a structure with two such modulation periods @xcite and as shown in  [ figmod1 ] the result is a very good agreement between observed and calculated peak positions .",
    "the intensities are not reproduced as the calculation did not include the unit cell formfactor , allowed for different modulation amplitude for different atoms or included experimental factors such as polarization and the lorentz factor .",
    "we finally emphasize that the observed bragg reflections are not compatible with an adaptive phase @xcite .",
    "the satellite lattice reflections from such a structure would result in evenly spaced intermediate reflections , with only small possible deviations due to stacking faults @xcite     and [ 2 - 24 ] peaks of a single mt twin .",

    "the 800  nm pump and probe pulse were generated with a 2  khz ti - saphire laser system .",
    "the pump and probe pulses were cross polarized and incident along the [ 001 ] surface normal with the probe polarization aligned to the [ 100 ] crystal axis . the pump was focused to @xmath76 and the probe spot size was a factor of three smaller to ensure homogenous excitation of the probe region .",
    "the sample was mounted in a cryostat .    in  [ figopt]a",
    "we show the result of a time resolved optical pump - probe reflectivity measurements taken above and below @xmath1 with a pump fluence of 1  mj/@xmath22 .",
    "below @xmath1 the signal shows clear oscillations , with a beating indicating the presence of more than a single frequency . above @xmath1",
    "no oscillations are present , beyond a single initial dip in reflectivity .",
    "in addition there is an initial electronic peak , whose amplitude as seen in  [ figopt]b scales with fluence .",
    "the phase transition is clearly visible as the active phonon modes change with the change in lattice symmetry .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively consistent with what we have observed in single crystal ni@xmath0mnga @xcite .",
    "both a fourier analysis and a fit including two cosine functions reveal the existence of two distinct frequencies , around 1.3 and 0.9  thz just below t@xmath77 and hardening as the temperature is lowered .",
    "given the two modulation wavevectors of the structure , the two coherent phonons can be attributed to two amplitudons , that is , an oscillation of the modulation amplitude .",

    "this model is however complicated as it must be combined with the existence of a coherent phonon to account for the data in fig.1(a ) of the main text .    the critical fluence @xmath83",
    "mj/@xmath22 can be converted to a corresponding temperature , though this number depends on the laser absorption depth . for @xmath15",
    "nm we find a critical energy density of 797  j/@xmath84 , which is about 1  ev per unit cell or a temperature rise of 250  k. while it then appears that the energy needed to quench the modulation on an ultrafast timescale is significantly higher than the thermal energy needed to reach @xmath1 , one explanation might be that this energy is distributed in various electronic channels from which only a fraction contributes to quenching the modulation .",
    "the data in fig.2(b ) of the main paper is composed from rocking curves ( rotation of the sample around the surface normal ) taken at different time delays .",
    "the rocking curves for four different pump fluences are shown in  [ figausrc ] . the un - pumped rocking curve , as seen in  [ figausrc]a at t = -0.25  ps is , a combination of the rocking curves from 6 of the 12 mt twins , which are here probed in a single scan .",
    "the shape can be reproduced from the static x - ray data if one take into account the opening angles of the avalanche photo diode used for the time - resolved experiments . at a low fluence of 1.7  mj/@xmath22",
    "the transition is only seen as a small increase in intensity at the location of the aus peak , while the majority of the film remains in the mt phase . only at the high fluence of 12  mj/@xmath22 in",
    "[ figausrc]d is the high temperature aus phase reached . here",
    "the entire film is transformed and a single strong aus ( 202 ) bragg reflection occurs at @xmath85 . at the intermediate fluences only parts of the film is transformed , resulting in a strained aus structure .",
    "the temperature rise due to a single laser pulse is given as : @xmath86 the specific heat of ni@xmath0mnga is c = 0.35 - 0.4  j / gk and the density is @xmath87 . the laser penetration depth at @xmath88  nm is @xmath89 , the reflectivity is r = 0.15 and @xmath90 is the thickness of the layer in which the laser is absorbed . for @xmath91",
    "m , the thickness of the film , the highest fluence of 12  mj/@xmath22 corresponds to a temperature rise of @xmath92  k. this is just sufficient to raise the temperature of the film from 340  k to above @xmath1 , under the assumption that the heat is evenly distributed .",
    "this is in good agreement with the observed rocking curves where lower laser fluences only lead to a partial transformation ."
