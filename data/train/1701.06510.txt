    "<S> we consider multilayered metamaterials comprising slightly high index inclusions ( i.e. whose permittivity is such that @xmath0 , @xmath1 is the small period to vacuum wavelength ratio ) and with low average permittivity . </S>",
    "<S> we show , by first - principles , that their optical response is driven by an unprecedented competition of first and second order spatial dispersions which are comparable due to a dramatic and non - resonant enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> such unusual competition provides various dispersion regimes supporting additional waves and topological phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular there is a novel situation where the isofrequency contour of transverse magnetic waves is bounded and disconnected . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed metamaterials are very feasible even in the optical range since , unlike high index inclusions metamaterials , they do not resort to the condition @xmath2 for enhancing second order spatial dispersion effects and can provide novel strategies for optical manipulation and steering .    </S>",
    "<S> metamaterials , showing unconventional and/or tailored effective electromagnetic response , have offered a unique platform for introducing novel optical mechanisms as negative refraction , super- and hyperlensing , transformation optics , etc . @xcite . in the long - wavelength limit , metamaterial optical response is usually described through phenomenological parameters , such as effective permittivity and permeability @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if the period to wavelength ratio is not very small or metal inclusions are involved , metamaterial response has an additional nonlocal contribution ( spatial dispersion ) and accordingly , nonlocal effective medium theories are in order . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth stressing that artificial electromagnetic chirality and optical magnetism , fundamental ingredients of metamaterial science , are manifestations of first and second order spatial dispersion , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> artificial electromagnetic chirality ( due to 3d , 2d and 1d geometrical chirality @xcite ) yields interesting electromagnetic phenomena as , for example , giant optical activity , asymmetric transmission , negative refractive index @xcite and repulsive casimir force @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , artificial or optical magnetism supports negative refractive index and backward - waves propagation . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that second order spatial dispersion is not fully equivalent to artificial magnetism and such discrepancy has not been exploited in applied science . even though second order and </S>",
    "<S> non - magnetic nonlocalities are generally considered detrimental for several applications @xcite , they have been shown to support intriguing effects as propagation of additional waves @xcite and topological transitions @xcite . in this context , exploiting such nonlocalities is one of the challenges of metamaterial science .    </S>",
    "<S> spatial dispersion is ruled by the period to wavelength ratio @xmath1 so that , unlike conventional matter , metamaterials offer a natural way for enhancing nonlocality by tailoring the meta - atoms spatial distribution . </S>",
    "<S> there are also other strategies to modify the hierarchy of the spatial dispersion orders : ( i ) by optimizing the shape and size of inclusions @xcite , ( ii ) by exploiting plasmonic resonances @xcite , ( iii ) by resorting to extreme regimes where the permittivity and/or the permeability are close to zero @xcite and ( iv ) by embedding high - index dielectric inclusions ( whose permittivity is such that @xmath2 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter strategy has been crucially exploited to achieve all - dielectric metamaterials ( whose response has also a magnetic contribution ) without high dissipation @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a strategy to achieve an unusual electromagnetic response where the first and second order nonlocalities contributions are both enhanced , without resorting to plasmonic resonances , to the point that the effect of their mutual competition is comparable with the local medium response . </S>",
    "<S> such competition is very unusual in non - resonating setups since the two nonlocalities have generally different orders of magnitude and , remarkably , since their symmetry properties are different , the first and second order spatial dispersions being ruled and unaffected by geometric chirality , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this occurs in multi - layered media : @xmath3 comprising inclusions whose dielectric permittivity is such that @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the small period to vacuum wavelength ratio , ( slightly high index inclusions ) ; @xmath4 whose average permittivity is much smaller than @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze by first principle the ensuing and unprecedented metamaterial response and we show that transverse magnetic ( tm ) waves are ruled by a biquadratic highly tunable energy - momentum relation supporting a plethora of phenomena encompassing additional waves and topological phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to hyperbolic , elliptic and mixed regimes , the metamaterial supports a topologically nontrivial dispersion regime characterized by bounded and multiply - connected isofrequency contours accompanied by additional waves . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed slightly high index inclusions metamaterials ( shims ) , are structurally very simple and provide a novel route to exploit spatial dispersion for steering the radiation . </S>",
    "<S> a further significant advantage of shims over high index inclusion metamaterials is that the requirement @xmath0 is much less severe than the condition @xmath2 @xcite and hence shims can be manufactured in spectral regions where extremely high permittivity media are not available , as for example , the optical range .    consider a one - dimensional multilayered medium which is periodically stratified along the @xmath6-axis and whose unit cell , of thickness @xmath7 , consists of a background dielectric matrix hosting an inclusion ( see fig.[five - regimes](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric permittivity @xmath8 is @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the matrix and the inclusion , respectively . in the presence of a monochromatic electromagnetic field ( @xmath11 ) </S>",
    "<S> whose vacuum wavelength @xmath12 is larger than the stratification period , the small ratio @xmath13 rules the homogenization of the medium response . </S>",
    "<S> as defined in the introduction , a shim is characterized by the two basic requirements :    1 .   </S>",

    "<S> we have performed a multi - scale analysis of tm waves electrodynamics ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 , see supplemental material ) in shims and we have obtained that , in the long wavelength limit @xmath18 , the leading medium response is modeled by the constitutive relations @xmath19 where @xmath20^{-1 } , \\ : \\epsilon_{\\perp } = \\overline{\\varepsilon(x ) } +   \\sum_n \\frac{a_{-n } a_{n}}{n^2 } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\kappa & = & i \\epsilon _ { || } \\sum_n \\frac{a_{-n } b_{n}}{n } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta & = & \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{|| } } \\left ( \\sum_n   \\frac{a_{-n } a_{n}}{n^2 } - \\kappa^2 \\right ) +   \\sum_{n , m } \\frac{a_{m } a_{-(m+n ) } b_{n}}{m(m+n)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the series are over all the integers @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the fourier coefficients of @xmath8 and @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 ) . equations ( [ response ] ) and ( [ par_eff ] ) contain the main result of this letter and they show that shims , in addition to the local response , display both first and second order spatial dispersion . using the serdyukov - fedorov transformation method </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it is straightforward proving that the obtained first order spatial dispersion is equivalent to 1d - electromagnetic chirality @xcite and that the second order spatial dispersion is non - magnetic ( i.e. there is not transformation yielding a non - vanishing magnetic permeability ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is essential here stressing that eqs.([response ] ) does not contain @xmath1 and this physically yields an unprecedented regime where local response and nonlocalities mutually compete on the same footing . note that in media with shallow dielectric modulation spatial dispersion contributions are too weak to appear in the leading order term of the effective response ( they are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the shim requirements ( i ) and ( ii ) forbid resonances that would produce a dominant local response and at the same time they trigger a peculiar nonlocality enhancement which differently raises the standard first and second order spatial dispersions contributions , whereas higher order spatial dispersion contributions are still weak . in order to discuss this point , </S>",
    "<S> let us first analyze its local component . </S>",
    "<S> due to the shim requirement @xmath3 , the average of @xmath29 is dominated by the background contribution @xmath9 so that @xmath30 ( see the first of eqs.([par_eff ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a key point characterizing shims since , in the presence of a uniformly large dielectric spatial modulation , @xmath31 is so large to yield superlensing @xcite which is unaffected by spatial dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the shim requirement @xmath4 , achievable by suitably tailoring the inclusion dielectric profile ( see below ) , states that first contribution @xmath32 to @xmath33 in the second of eqs.([par_eff ] ) is not large . on the other hand , the fourier coefficients of @xmath8 ( with @xmath34 ) </S>",
    "<S> are @xmath23 with @xmath35 as a consequence of the shim requirement @xmath3 and hence @xmath36 . in other words , even if the dielectric modulation is large , a shim has effective permittivities which are not so large to suppress the effect of spatial dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> let us analyze now the nonlocal response . </S>",
    "<S> the shim requirement @xmath3 implies that all the fourier coefficients of @xmath37 are dominated by the permittivity of the background and hence @xmath38 . as a consequence , from the third and fourth of eqs.([par_eff ] ) , the whole shim nonlocal response is as strong as the local component .    </S>",
    "<S> such a peculiar spatial dispersion enhancement can heuristically be grasped from the effective medium response of a layered medium with shallow ( s ) dielectric modulation reported in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the constitutive relations of that case for tm waves coincide with eqs.([response ] ) without the second order spatial dispersion contribution and with electromagnetic parameters @xmath39^{-1}$ ] , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the fourier coefficients of @xmath8 and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> spatial dispersion in this situation is weak since @xmath45 and this is due to the low dielectric contrast . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial point here is that if we replace @xmath46 and @xmath47 in @xmath48 the expression of @xmath49 of eqs.([par_eff ] ) is fully recovered so that we can state that shim mechanism is literally able to haul first order spatial dispersion from the @xmath1 order to the leading one . </S>",
    "<S> generalizing , this observation also sheds light on the shim enhancement of the second order spatial dispersion which , in a low dielectric contrast medium , is very weak ( @xmath28 ) with contributions containing either two @xmath42 or two @xmath43 terms . </S>",
    "<S> the above shim mechanism of raising only @xmath50 ( for @xmath34 ) thus efficiently boosts the contributions containing two @xmath42 terms and this explains their appearance in eqs.([par_eff ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the specific shim structure ( see requirements ( i ) and ( ii ) ) crucially modifies the spatial dispersion orders hierarchy to the point of triggering an unprecedented overall competition between first and second order contribution which are as strong as the local optical response .     and @xmath10 are the matrix and the inclusion permettivities , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the above discussed competition between local response and nonlocalities implies that , in principle , every possible regime provided by eq.([disp2 ] ) can be achieved since the four coefficients in eqs.([disp2 ] ) depend on the four independent effective shim parameters which , in turn , are mutually comparable .    ) in the elliptic - like ii regime . </S>",
