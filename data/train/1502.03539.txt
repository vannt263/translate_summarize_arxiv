    "a novel and exclusively quantum process qt is also of basic theoretical interest because it necessitates a proper treatment of quantum measurement and entanglement dynamics in realistic physical conditions , such as environmental influences .",
    "the advent of a new era of quantum sciences and engineering demands more precise understanding and further clarification of such fundamental issues .",
    "this includes quantum information and classical information , quantum nonlocality and relativistic locality , and spacelike correlations and causality .",
    "the study of these issues in a relativistic setting now belongs to a new field called relativistic quantum information @xcite .",
    "the first scheme of qt was proposed by bennett _",
    "( bbcjpw ) @xcite , in which an _ unknown _ state of a qubit @xmath0 is teleported from one spatially localized agent alice to another agent bob using an entangled pair of qubits @xmath1 and @xmath2 prepared in one of the bell states and shared by alice and bob , respectively . such an idea was then adapted to the systems with continuous variables such as harmonic oscillators ( hos ) by vaidman @xcite , who introduced an ideal einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) state @xcite for the shared entangled pair to teleport an unknown coherent state .",
    "braunstein and kimble ( bk ) @xcite generalized vaidman s scheme from the ideal epr states with exact correlations to squeezed coherent states . in doing so the uncertainty of the measurable quantities",
    "has to be considered , which reduces the degree of entanglement of the @xmath3 pair as well as the fidelity of quantum teleportation ( fiqt ) .",
    "alsing and milburn made the first attempt of calculating the fiqt between two moving cavities in relativistic motions @xcite  one is at rest ( alice ) , the other is uniformly accelerated ( bob , called rob in @xcite with the initial  r \" for  rindler observer \" ; we follow this convention in section [ physreal ] for a similar setup ) in the minkowski frame  to see how the fidelity is degraded by the unruh effect ( also see refs .",
    "later landulfo and matsas considered a complete bbcjpw qt in a two - level detector qubit model , where rob s detector is uniformly accelerated and interacting with the quantum field only in a finite duration .",
    "they found that the fiqt in the future asymptotic region using the out state of the entangled pair is indeed reduced by the unruh effect experienced by rob @xcite .",
    "along the line of ref .",
    "@xcite friis _",
    "@xcite studied the role of the dynamical casimir effect in the qt between cavities in relativistic motions .",

    "@xcite , but based on the bk scheme _ in the interaction region _ : an unknown coherent state of a ud detector with internal ho is teleported from alice to bob using an entangled pair of similar ud detectors initially in a two - mode squeezed state and shared by alice and bob .",
    "unfortunately , the fiqt considered in ref .",
    "@xcite is not the physical one .",
    "more careful consideration is needed to get the correct results @xcite .    indeed , when considering qt in a fully relativistic system , particularly in the interaction region of the localized objects and quantum fields , one has to take all the factors listed below into account consistently .",
    "localized objects in a relativistic system may behave differently when observed in different reference frames :    [ [ frame - dependence ] ] frame dependence + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    since quantum entanglement between two spatially localized degrees of freedom is a kind of spacelike correlation in a quantum state , which depends on reference frames , quantum entanglement of two localized objects separated in space is frame dependent .",

    "these three basic properties of relativistic quantum systems essential for the consideration of qt have not been properly recognized or explored in detail or depth .",
    "the qubits or detectors in question are unavoidably coupled with quantum fields , which act as an ubiquitous environment :    [ [ quantum - decoherence ] ] quantum decoherence + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    each qubit or ho can be decohered by virtue of its coupling to a quantum field .",
    "however , mutual influences mediated by the field between two localized qubits or hos when placed in close range can lessen the decoherence on each .",

    "[ [ unruh - effect ] ] unruh effect + + + + + + + + + + + +    a pointlike object such as a ud detector coupled with a quantum field and uniformly accelerated in the minkowski vacuum of the field would experience a thermal bath of the field quanta at the unruh temperature proportional to its proper acceleration .",
    "the above factors have been considered earlier in some detail in our study on entanglement dynamics @xcite , but there are new issues of foundational value that need be included in the consideration of qt .",
    "below we mention three issues related to relativistic open quantum systems :    [ [ measurement - in - different - frames ] ] measurement in different frames + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    quantum states make sense only in a given frame in which a hamiltonian is well defined @xcite .",
    "two quantum states of the same system with quantum fields in different frames are directly comparable only on those totally overlapping time slices associated with some moment in each frame . by a measurement local in space ,",
    "e.g. , on a pointlike ud detector coupled with a quantum field , quantum states of the combined system in different frames can be interpreted as if they collapsed on different time slices passing through the same measurement event .",
    "nevertheless , the postmeasurement states will evolve to the same state up to a coordinate transformation when they are compared at some time slice in the future , if the combined system respects relativistic covariance @xcite .",

    "classical information needs some time to travel from alice to bob , and during the traveling time , bob s part of the entangled pair keeps evolving , so the physical fiqt will not be equal to the  pseudofidelity \" and is thus incommensurate in general with the degree of entanglement of the entangled pair evaluated on the minkowski time slice .",
    "this feature has been overlooked in the literature .      to address all the above issues consistently and thoroughly , we start with the action of a fully relativistic system .",

    "we have considered the quantum teleportation of continuous variables applied to three unruh  dewitt detectors with internal harmonic oscillators coupled to a common quantum field .",
    "the basic properties of relativistic effects in dynamical open quantum systems such as the frame dependence of quantum entanglement , wave functional collapse , doppler shift , quantum decoherence , and the unruh effect have all been considered consistently and their linkage manifestly displayed .",
    "below is a summary of what we have learned from these studies",
    ".      quantum entanglement of two localized objects at different positions requires the knowledge of spacelike correlations , while the averaged fiqt involves timelike correlations between two causally connected events . in general",
    "these two quantities are incommensurate . to compare them , in sec .",
    "[ fiqtenlc ] we introduced the projection of the wave functional _ around the future light cone _ of the joint - measurement event by the sender , so that right after the wave functional collapse the sender s classical signal of the outcome reaches the receiver , according to which the receiver performs the local operation immediately .",
    "the averaged fiqt obtained in this way can be directly compared with the degree of quantum entanglement in the entangled detector pair evaluated right before the wave functional collapse , namely , the enlc , which can be easily calculated in the heisenberg picture .    we have observed that the best averaged fiqt always drops below the fidelity of classical teleportation earlier than the disentanglement time for the enlc in each of our numerical results .",
    "this confirms the inequality ( [ mvbound ] ) , which implies that entanglement of the detector pair is a necessary condition for the averaged fiqt beating the classical fidelity . in sec .",
    "[ lt2iho ] , we further showed that the inequality ( [ mvbound ] ) may appear to be violated by the degrees of quantum entanglement evaluated on a time slice in conventional coordinate systems .",
    "this proves that the enlc , rather than the conventional ones , is essential in qt in a relativistic open quantum system .      for a relativistic system including both the local and nonlocal objects such as a detector - field interacting system , the hamiltonian , quantum states , and quantum entanglement extracted from the states all depend on the choice of the reference frame @xcite .",
    "part of the coordinate dependence can be suppressed by evaluating the physical quantities around the future or past light cones of a local observer . however",
    ", this does not give a unique description on a physical process , since each local object has a clock reading its own proper time , which is invariant under coordinate transformations .",
    "in particular , a qt process involves two different physical clocks for the sender and the receiver localized in space , and the degradation of the enlc and the averaged fiqt in the same process can appear very differently in the sender s clock and in the receiver s point of view along his / her past light cone .",
    "when describing nonlocal physical processes with local objects in a relativistic open quantum system , one has to first specify which clock or which point of view being used ; otherwise , there will be ambiguity in the statements .",
    "it is easy to understand that the fiqt between localized quantum objects in a field vacuum with one party or both accelerated would be degraded by the unruh effect because of the thermality appearing in these accelerated objects @xcite .",
    "however the more ubiquitous relativistic effects in inertial frames such as time dilation and doppler shift ( related to the relative speed ) that are mixed in with effects due to acceleration have not been understood fully in the context of qt .",
    "these effects and their interplay are the focus of this study .",
    "what we found that may be surprising is that the relativistic effects in affecting the description of the dynamics can overwhelm the unruh effect .",
    "for example , there is degradation of fidelity when both parties are inertial , as shown in our case 1 , and a larger acceleration does not always lead to a faster degradation , as shown in our cases 2 and 3 .",
    "the averaged fiqt in cases 2 , 3 , and 4 do depend on the proper acceleration @xmath260 in bob s acceleration phase significantly . in case 2 ,",
    "we find that the larger @xmath260 is , the higher the degradation rate will be in the sender s clock for the best averaged fidelities @xmath196 of qt both from alice to rob and from rob to alice . nevertheless , the increasing redshift as the retarded distance between alice and rob increasing indefinitely in time is the key factor for the @xmath260 dependence here . in the receiver s point of view , that the degradation rate increases as @xmath260 increases , is true only for a receiver accelerated with proper acceleration large enough , when the unruh effect fully dominates . in case 3 a larger @xmath260 turns out to give a longer disentanglement time of the enlc in the clock of the sender alice at rest .",
    "the key factor there is that detector @xmath2 with the traveling twin bob ages much slower than detector @xmath1 with alice at rest when they compare their clocks at the same place after bob rejoins alice .",
    "the acceleration of bob leads to this asymmetry of time flows as in the well - known twin paradox and bob s slower clock helps to keep the freshness of quantum coherence in the @xmath3 pair longer from the view of alice s clock , while the retarded distance between alice and bob is bounded from above .    to suppress the relativistic effects in what is observed by alice , who is always at rest",
    ", we considered case 4 in which bob is undergoing an alternating uniform acceleration with a small speed and a constant averaged retarded distance . the results indeed show that the larger the @xmath260 , the shorter the disentanglement time for enlc , even in alice s point of view when @xmath260 is large enough , although the unruh temperature is not well defined in this setup for the lack of a sufficiently long duration of uniform acceleration .",
