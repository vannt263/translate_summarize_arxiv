    "fiber communication systems have experienced a dramatic evolution over the past two decades as the traffic demand has continued to grow @xcite . in order to satisfy this demand for capacity , there has been a focus on increasing spectral efficiency by , e.g. , reducing the guard interval in wavelength division multiplexing or employing high - order modulation formats .",
    "square quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) formats are the preferred alternative due to their simplicity in generation and detection as each constellation point is located on a regular square grid .",
    "a way to further increase spectral efficiency is by means of signal shaping @xcite . in particular , geometrical shaping could be used , where constellation points are nonuniformly arranged on the complex plane",

    "reach increases were experimentally demonstrated in @xcite using a finite number of maxwell - boltzmann distributions .",
    "these distributions were chosen to target different net data rates , and shaping gains over a transmission range of more than 4500  km were reported .    in this letter , we study the benefits of using probabilistically shaped qam over uniform qam .",
    "both a back - to - back ( b2b ) single - carrier optical system and numerical simulations are considered .",
    "the contributions of the paper are twofold .",
    "first , a significant gain in snr is demonstrated for a state - of - the - art digital coherent transceiver . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first experimental study of b2b transceiver sensitivity improvements due to probabilistic shaping in optical communications .",
    "second , we investigate the effect of mismatched probabilistic shaping , i.e. , how a mismatch between channel snr and the snr for which the input distribution is optimized affects shaping gains .",
    "we find that four input distributions are sufficient to obtain large shaping gains for 64qam over a wide snr range .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first numerical study of shaping robustness to a channel mismatch .",
    "finding a good nonuniform input distribution for qam constellations is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) optimization problem . however , because of the symmetry of the 2d constellation , of the binary reflected gray labeling which is typically used , and the awgn channel for which the optimization is carried out , it is sufficient to consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) constellation . under these assumptions",
    ", @xmath1-qam constellations can be decomposed into a product of two constituent 1d ( pulse amplitude modulation ) constellations , each with @xmath2 constellation points . without loss of generality , we therefore consider only one of the quadratures for the shaping optimization , however , we emphasize that all analysis in sec .

    "it is interesting to note that the awgn curves cross at approximately 7  db snr .",

    "we observe that in order to cover the entire relevant channel snr range with a penalty of at most 0.1  db snr , only four different input pmfs are required .",

    "sensitivity gains of up to 0.8  db over uniform input distributions were measured experimentally , showing an excellent match with awgn simulations and effectively closing the gap to capacity .",
    "it is yet to be investigated whether there are distributions other than the one considered in this work that yield higher spectral efficiencies in nonlinear fiber transmission .",
    "we further showed numerically that the shaping gain is robust to a mismatch between channel snr and snr assumed at the transmitter .",
