    "the computer simulation strategy for dynamics of complex systems known as _ dissipative particle dynamics _ or , simply , dpd , has been the subject of several studies in recent years .",
    "this methodology was introduced by hoogerbrugge _",
    "et al._@xcite to model the dynamic behaviour of fluids by using a particulate method in which an ensemble of _ mesoscopic _ particles interact with each other via conservative as well as dissipative forces .",
    "contrary to other particulate _",
    "methods@xcite , oriented at modelling the hydrodynamics of macroscopic systems , dpd also incorporates brownian forces in the particle - particle interactions . in this way",
    ", thermal fluctuations can be described and a certain thermodynamic equilibrium exists .",
    "dpd is , therefore , especially suited to the modelling of mesoscopic systems , where fluctuations play an important role .",
    "one can mention , for instance , the dynamics of polymer solutions , nucleation and phase separation problems , dynamics of confined fluids , colloidal suspensions , and kinetics of chemical reactions in confined geometries , etc .",
    "the dpd method has already been succesfully applied to some cases of practical interest such as to the rheology of colloidal suspensions@xcite and to the microphase separation of diblock copolymer solutions@xcite , among others .    in dpd , dissipative and random interactions",
    "are pairwise and chosen in such a way that the center of mass motion of each interacting pair is insensitive to these frictional and random forces .",
    "hence , on the one hand , if closed and thermally isolated , the system relaxes fast to its thermal equilibrium and , on the other , its overall momentum is a conserved variable in view of the particle s momentum exchange rules .",
    "this second feature allows the system to exhibit a hydrodynamic behaviour from a macroscopic point of view , that is , for length and time scales larger than those characterizing the particle - particle interactions . with respect to other mesoscopic models for hydrodynamic behaviour such as lattice gas@xcite or cellular automata@xcite , the dpd model is isotropic and galilean - invariant due to the fact that it is not defined on a lattice and is straightforwardly based on newton s equations of motion , as in md .",
    "in addition , it has no extra conservation laws and is also computationally efficient .",
    "as originally formulated , however , the dpd model can only deal with isothermal conditions since dissipative and brownian forces cause no energy conservation in the particle - particle interaction .",
    "the equation for the energy transport is then of the relaxation type@xcite and , therefore , heat flow , related to the energy conservation at the microscopic scale , can not be described within the framework of the original model ( which will be referred to as isothermal dpd from now on ) . in many problems of interest , either fundamental or applied ,",
    "the study of the transport properties of heat at the mesoscopic level are very important .",
    "thus , the incorporation of the thermal effects into a dpd algorithm is necessary for future applications of the method to problems of relevance .    in a previous paper@xcite we introduced an algorithm in which the conservation of the total energy in the particle - particle interaction was consistently taken into account with the inclusion of the particle s internal energy in the model ( this model",
    "will be referred to as dpde from now on ) . in this paper",
    "we will analyze several aspects of this novel dpde algorithm . in the first place",
    ", we discuss the extension of our original algorithm , given in ref.@xcite , to incorporate , on the one hand , temperature dependencies in the dynamic parameters of the model so that the treatment of arbitrary temperature - dependencies in the transport coefficients can be treated , something lacking in the older dpd models . on the other hand , we develop a direct derivation of the algorithm from the langevin equations of motion for the relavant variables , by introducing a interpretation rule for these langevin equations that ensures that the detailed balance condition is satisfied in an euler - like algorithm .",
    "the detailed balance condition is necessary for the system to evolve towards the proper thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , the algorithm obtained in this way conserves the energy at _ every time - step _ instead of _ in the mean _ as was the case in the older dpde algorithm@xcite .",
    "we have noticed that different algorithms lead to the same fokker - planck equation , i.e. , different stochastic processes can lead , in fact , to the same dynamics for the probability distribution . in the second place , we have analyzed the macroscopic equilibrium properties of the dpde system .",
    "we have shown that a thermodynamic analysis of the dpde system is possible in view of the fact that the equilibrium probability distribution is known .",
    "properties such as a free energy or the equations of state can be derived in terms of the parameters defining the model .",
    "the simulation results of the equilibrium properties show an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "third and last , we have done simulations in systems under a temperature gradient imposed by the temperature of two walls .",
    "we have found temperature profiles , as expected since the model allows the simulation of heat transport , and the existence of inhomogeneous temperature distributions , which is one of the main virtues of the dpde algorithm .",
    "furthermore , if a gravity field is considered , the system undergoes convective motion in addition to the temperature gradient , the rayleigh number qualitatively estimated as being of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the main hypothesis underlying the formulation of the dpde model@xcite , and derive the appropriate algorithm with arbitrary dependence of the transport coefficients with the temperature , and energy conservation at every time - step . the fokker - planck equation describing the evolution of the probability distribution for the ensemble of variables describing the state of the system is also derived together with the corresponding fluctuation - dissipation theorems . in section iii ,",
    "we obtain the macroscopic equilibrium properties of the dpde model and expressions for the equations of state and thermodynamic properties . at the end of this section",
    ", we pay attention to a particular model , used to perform simulations of equilibrium properties as well as heat transport and thermal convection .",
    "finally , in section iv we draw the main conclusions from our work .",
    "for our purposes , it is useful to have a physical picture and regard the dissipative particles as if they were _ clusters _ of true physical particles@xcite , i.e. , as particles with internal structure bearing some degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the dpde model is mesoscopic in nature since it resolves only the overall center - of - mass motion of the cluster and ignores the exact _ internal state _ of the cluster as a relevant variable .",
    "the interactions being dissipative and random , however , the total energy of the system is not conserved unless the energy exchanged between the resolved degrees of freedom and the internal state of the dpd particle is accounted for .",
    "we propose here a model based on the treatment of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic fluctuations@xcite , to consistently take into account the energy stored in the internal degrees of freedom of each particle , without explicit consideration of any _ internal _ hamiltonian .",
    "our model is based on the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the system contains @xmath1 particles interacting with each other via conservative as well as dissipative interactions .",
    "the conservative interactions are described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian depends on the momenta and the positions of all the particles .",
    "the particles interact through pair pontentials @xmath4 , depending only on the distance between them , and with an external field @xmath5 2 .",
    "in addition , the particles can store energy in some internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the internal energy @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , is introduced as a new relevant coordinate .",
    "the momentum @xmath8 , the position @xmath9 together with the internal energy @xmath6 , completely specify the state of the dissipative particle at a given instant @xmath10 .",
    "3 .   the particle - particle interaction is pairwise and conserves the total momentum and the total energy when the internal energy of the pair is taken into account .",
    "4 .   the internal states of the particle have no dynamics in the sense that they are always in equilibrium with themselves .",
    "this allows us to define a function @xmath11 .",
    "this function can arbitrarily be chosen according to the user s needs , except that it is constrained to thermodynamic consistency requirements@xcite 1 .",
    "@xmath12 must be a differentiable monotonically increasing function of its variable @xmath6 , so that @xmath13 exists and @xmath14 exists and is always positive .",
    "2 .   @xmath12 is a concave function of its argument . + defined in this way",
    ", @xmath12 can be viewed as a mesoscopic _ entropy _ of the @xmath15 particle , and @xmath16 can be seen as the particle s _ temperature_. the change in @xmath6 and in @xmath12 are related by a gibbs equation @xmath17 where the dot over the variables is used to denote time - differentiation from now on .",
    "the irreversible particle - particle interaction is such that the deterministic part ( in the absence of random forces ) must satisfy @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 label an arbitrary pair of interacting particles .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath12 and @xmath16 must remain unchanged under a galilean transformation , so that these variables are true scalars .",
    "7 .   the equilibrium probability distribution for the relevant variables of the system under isothermal conditions is chosen to be @xmath21 where @xmath22 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath23 is the thermodynamic , i.e. , macroscopic temperature .",
    "the first factor on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ pe ] ) contains the probability distribution for the set of variables @xmath24 , as given by equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the second factor on the right hand side corresponds , in turn , to the probability distribution for the internal energy of the particles as obtained from equilibrium fluctuation theory@xcite .",
    "effectively , @xmath25 gives the probability for the @xmath15 particle to have an internal energy @xmath6 regarding the rest of the system as a heat reservoir .",
    "the maximum of @xmath26 occurs at @xmath27 , in agreement with our interpretation of @xmath16 as the particle s temperature . furthermore ,",
    "notice that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the normalisation constant .",
    "once the equilibrium probability distribution is obtained , the _ thermodynamic _ properties of the model are determined .",
    "the model defined so far must be completed with a set of equations that explicitly establish its dynamical properties .",
    "initially , in view of the pairwise additivity of the interactions , we will analyze an arbitrary pair of particles , @xmath19 and @xmath20 say , and later on give the complete expressions for the @xmath1-particle system .",
    "the change in position and momentum of the @xmath15 particle due to the interaction with the @xmath30 particle follows from newton s second law @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the forces due to the conservative interactions .",
    "@xmath34 is , by construction , directed along the vector @xmath35 and satisfies @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , @xmath37 stands for the dissipative particle - particle interaction force and @xmath38 is the random force associated with the former .",
    "the total energy @xmath39 of the @xmath15 particle is the sum of the kinetic ( @xmath40 ) , the potential ( @xmath41 ) , and the internal energy ( @xmath6 ) contributions .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) to compute the change in the kinetic energy , we arrive at the equation for the change in the total energy @xmath42    the conservation of the total momentum of the pair imposes that its change is only due to the action of external force fields , that is , @xmath43 therefore , we must have that @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , conservation of the total angular momentum @xmath45 implies that dissipative as well as brownian forces , @xmath46 , must be directed along the unit vector @xmath47 .",
    "conservation of the total energy in the particle - particle interaction , @xmath48 gives , in turn , the rate of change of the internal energy of the pair @xmath49 this equation implies that if the total energy is to be conserved , then the change in the total internal energy has to be due to the work done by the dissipative and the associated random forces .",
    "the dissipative forces transfer mechanical energy to internal energy , while random forces bring back internal energy to the kinetic and potential energies of the particles . from the conservation equations",
    "alone , however , nothing can be inferred about how the internal energy is distributed among the particles so that one has to supply a given model .",
    "we will assume that the mechanisms driving the change in the internal energy of the particles are of two kinds .",
    "on the one hand , the work done by dissipative and random forces is shared in equal amounts by the particles and is irrespective of their temperatures @xmath16 and @xmath50 . on the other hand ,",
    "we assume that the particles can also vary their internal energy by exchanging internal energy if @xmath51 .",
    "the energy tranferred by this mechanism between the particles will be referred to as _ mesoscopic heat flow _ @xmath52 .",
    "associated with this dissipative current , a random heat flow @xmath53 must also be added .",
    "hence , we write @xmath54 with the requirement @xmath55 to ensure that eq . ( [ 9 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "note that the r.h.s .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) preserves galilean - invariance .",
    "so far , only the conservation equations have been used to find general properties to be satisfied by the dissipative forces and mesoscopic heat flows , referred to as _ dissipative currents _ in a wider sense from now on . in analogy with the thermodynamics of irreversible processes@xcite",
    ", we can make use of the gibbs equation , eq .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) to find the _",
    "particle s entropy production _ from the interaction between pairs , yielding @xmath56 where only the deterministic part of the interactions has explicitly been considered , according to point 5 .",
    "the inequality in this last equation is the expression of the second law of thermodynamics , indicating the irreversibility of the particle s dissipative interations . from the entropy production equation the so - called _ thermodynamic forces",
    "_ can be identified as the factors multiplying the respective dissipative currents , @xmath37 and @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "thus , in the spirit of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes@xcite we propose a linear relation between the dissipative currents and the thermodynamic forces of the form @xmath57 the functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 are analogous to the so - called onsager coefficients@xcite . due to the different tensorial natures of the momentum flux and the heat flux ,",
    "these phenomena are not coupled in eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) ( curie s theorem@xcite ) .",

    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) must satisfy the following conditions so that the system can reach the proper thermodynamic equilibrium    1 .",
    "the thermodynamic forces are galilean - invariant , as are the dissipative currents .",
    "this implies that the onsager coefficients must also be galilean - invariant .",
    "microscopic reversibility implies that @xmath58 and @xmath59 must be even functions under time - reversal@xcite .",
    "3 .   since the thermodynamic forces change their sign under the exchange @xmath60 , then @xmath58 and @xmath59 must be _ invariant _ under this transformation .",
    "this fact is crucial in the derivation of the transport properties of the system .    in the _ linear _ non - equilibrium thermodynamics scheme ,",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 are constants .",
    "however , this choice restricts the expression for the macroscopic transport coefficients of the model to a given particular form which , in addition , seldom occurs in nature@xcite .",
    "thus , we will consider a general dependence of the onsager coefficients in both the distance @xmath61 and the temperatures of the particles @xmath16 and @xmath50 , in order to allow the model to describe the temperature dependence of the macroscopic transport coefficients .",
    "thus , for convenience , let us rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) in a different form @xmath62 written in this way , these expressions are reminiscent of the macroscopic phenomenological newton s law for the transport of momentum , and fourier s law for heat transport@xcite .",

    "( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) one can see that if @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constants , then the mesoscopic onsager coefficients depend on the particles internal energy through the temperatures @xmath16 and @xmath50 .",
    "the presence of temperature - dependencies in the mesoscopic onsager coefficients will introduce subtleties in the derivation of the algorithm due to the so - called it - stratonovich dilemma@xcite that we will discuss later on .",
    "the properties of the random terms are also chosen to parallel the theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations@xcite .",

    "the range of this force is of the order of the range of the particle - particle interaction .",
    "as far as the wall - particle dissipative interactions are concerned , we have considered as being analogous to the particle - particle interactions .",
    "hence when a particle is within the interaction range of a wall , it exchanges heat and exerts a force orthogonal to the wall as if the latter were a particle of infinite mass and heat capacity .",
    "therefore , the walls act as heat reservoirs at a given specified temperature , and non - stick boundary conditions apply .    in the simulations ,",
    "the two walls in the @xmath216-axis were kept at fixed temperatures of @xmath217 and @xmath218 , while the other two walls were adiabatic and were placed in the @xmath219-axis , along which a gravity field was imposed on the particles .",
    "qualitatively , the gravity was weak enough not to cause an excesive density gradient along the @xmath219-axis , and the particle s thermal condutivity was chosen to be very small to emphasize the convective effects . initially at rest , the system spontaneously evolved towards a stationary convection roll as seen in fig .",

    "the velocity field has been calculated by dividing the space into boxes and averaging the velocity of the particles inside the box at a given instance of time .",

    "4 ) , causing a displacement of the vortex centre towards the denser region , and also inducing a faster motion in the upper layers , as compared with the bottom of the box .",
    "various aspects of the _ dissipative particle dynamics with energy conservation _ algorithm , already introduced in ref.@xcite , have been treated here in depth . in particular ,",
    "emphasis has been placed on two major points .",
    "firstly , the original dpde algorithm has been extended in two ways : to incorporate arbitrary temperature - dependencies in the transport coefficients , and to assure that the algorithm conserves the energy at every time - step rather than in the mean , as in our previous algorithm@xcite .",
    "secondly , in this paper we have studied the thermodynamic properties modelled by the dpde algorithm such as the free energy and equations of state , and shown agreement between the simulated and theoretically predicted probability distributions . to demonstrate the ability of the dpde algorithm in simulating the hydrodynamic behaviour of fluids under non - equilibrium conditions ,",
    "simulations have been carried out for a system with a temperature gradient orthogonal to a gravity field .",
    "the results show the expected convective pattern for the velocity field , as well as the corresponding tilted temperature profile .",
    "these points stress the inherent features of the new dpde algorithm as compared with the isothermal versions .",
    "with respect to the first major point , and with a view to the use of the dpd methodology for the simulation of the dynamics of real fluids , it was necessary to incorporate arbitrary dependencies of the transport coefficients in the temperature .",
    "we have constructed an algorithm where the mesoscopic friction and heat conduction coefficients , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , can depend on the particle s temperature .",
    "one can compare eq .",
    "( [ 43 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ 35f ] ) , to see that both coefficients are independent of the temperature , neither the particle s nor the thermodynamic temperatures .",
    "contrarily , the functional form of eq .",
    "( [ 44 ] ) gives rise to the @xmath222 dependence of the thermal conductivity coefficient .",
    "of course , since eqs .",
    "( [ 35e ] ) and ( [ 35f ] ) are approximate , there must exist additional temperature dependencies that may be due either to @xmath223 or to the kinetic transport of momentum and energy . note that , the latter has been neglected in our derivation of the transport coefficients .",
    "another aspect worth mentioning in this context is our derivation of an implicit algorithm .",
    "this derivation has two important properties . on the one hand",
    ", the algorithm can be directly obtained from the langevin equations used to formulate the problem of the dpd particle dynamics .",
    "we have simply introduced an interpretation rule of the random terms , when integrating the equations of motion in a @xmath100 , which is different from the usual it - stratonovich interpretations . on the other hand , the resulting algorithm , with the proper fluctuation - dissipation theorems ,",
    "straightforwardly satisfies detailed balance which is required for the model to behave in a thermodynamically consistent manner .",
    "furthermore , since this algorithm has been directly obtained from the langevin equations ( [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) , and ( [ 10 ] ) , it satisfies energy conservation at every time step , as do the langevin equations themselves .",
    "we have also indicated that a family of different algorithms can lead to the same fokker - planck equation . since the process is gaussian , it is completely determined by the first and second moments of the probability distributions for the random variables .",
    "thus , the defining trends of this family of algorithms is that these first and second moments be the same for all of them , up to the order of validity of the algorithm itself , @xmath82 . as an example , let us average eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) with respect to the random number @xmath224 , giving @xmath225    \\label{53b}\\ ] ] the same result is obtained from our previous algorithm proposed in eq .",
    "( 16 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that indeed the firsts moments of the variation of the momentum for both algorithms are identical .",
    "of course , the same procedure can be repeated for all the first and second moments of all the increments of the variables in a time - step .",
    "thus , despite the fact that the macroscopic properties of both algorithms are the same , it should be emphasised that the present algorithm preserves energy conservation at every time - step while all the other possible algorithms only do so in the mean . this can be verified by summing all the contributions to the energy for a pair of particles in a time - step .",
    "this point is of crucial importance when analysing the dynamic behaviour of the system , in particular when the exact conservation of the energy is checked during the simulations .    regarding the second major point ,",
    "we have emphasized in this article the existing tight relation between the overall properties of the dpde model developed here and the macroscopic properties of real systems .",
    "this tight relationship will allow dpde models to simulate the dynamic behaviour of real fluids , with respect to the equilibrium and transport properties of both momentum and energy .",
    "when the energy conservation is introduced , the existence of a _ thermodynamic behaviour _ of the dpde system becomes apparent .",
    "we have seen that the hypothesis leading to the present algorithm can reproduce not only the maxwell - boltzmann probability distribution for the momenta , but also the arbitrary probability distribution for the particle s internal energy .",
    "furthermore , we have introduced a free energy from a partition function related to the system probability distribution . in the calculation of this partition function , the particle s internal energy @xmath6 has been considered as an additional microscopic degree of freedom . from this formulation ,",
    "we can obtain equations of state in terms of the parameters of the model .",
    "in particular , we have obtained a relationship between the internal energy of the whole system and its macroscopic temperature .",
    "this equation of state is useful since it allows one to relate the total energy introduced in a closed dpde system with the final equilibrium temperature .",
    "the agreement between the predicted temperature and the simulated one is excellent .",
    "the pressure equation for this system has also been obtained , showing once more excellent agreement between the simulated and theoretical predictions .",
    "the pressure in a dpd system in general is constrained by the particle number density , which is much smaller than that of the corresponding real system being modelled .",
    "this is due to the implicit coarse - graining in the model , in which a packet of physical molecules is represented by a single dpd particle .",
    "clearly , this is an area that needs to be further studied .",
    "however , for low mach number flows , the dpde fluid can be regarded as effectively incompressible , and thus a boussinesq - like approximation is of use . under these conditions ,",
    "the thermal dilatation coefficient is the one that has to be properly modelled . in the particular system analyzed here , for instance",
    ", this coefficient , @xmath201 , is that of an ideal gas @xmath226 with a proper choice of the interaction potential this coefficient could be tuned according to the kind of fluid to be modelled .",
    "note the excellent qualitative agreement found between the non - equilibrium simulations of a convective flow presented here and real fluid flows under equivalent conditions .",
    "these simulations can be theoretically analysed in light of the boussinesq approximation .",
    "finally , we have also identified a non - equilibrium free energy which acts as a lyapunov functional for the dynamics of the system .",
    "therefore , as seen in the simulations the dpde system has an inherent irreversible tendency towards a thermal equilibrium when no external forcing exists .",
    "moreover , other quantities have been theoretically derived such as the viscosity , the thermal conductivity , and the speed of sound .",
    "an in depth analysis of the derivation of these quantities and the consequences that can be drawn from its dynamic behaviour lie beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of the internal energy in the dpd algorithm reinforces the internal consistency of the model and opens interesting perspectives aimed at the use of these models in the simulation of the macroscopic - mesoscopic behaviour of simple and complex fluids .",

    "the requirement that the heat capacity of the particle must be larger than @xmath22 is due to the fact that the mesoscopic random heat flow is modelled as a continuum process subjet to gaussian statistics .",

    "this is due to the fact that the characteristic particle internal energy is of the order of @xmath148 while fluctuations in the same variable are of the order of @xmath149 .",
