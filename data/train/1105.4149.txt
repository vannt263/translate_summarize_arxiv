    "a random walk with a step size distribution that has a divergent second moment is called a lvy walk @xcite . a lvy _ glass _ is a random medium where the separation between two scattering events has a divergent second moment .",
    "the term was coined by barthelemy , bertolotti , and wiersma @xcite , for a random packing of polydisperse glass spheres .",

    "although correlations were expected to become less significant with increasing dimensionality @xcite , buonsante , burioni , and vezzani @xcite have calculated that the transmission exponent @xmath13 should remain much larger than would follow from a lvy walk with uncorrelated steps .",
    "in particular , a saturation at the diffusive value @xmath9 for @xmath14 is predicted  even though the second moment of the step size distribution becomes finite only for @xmath15 .    to test these analytical predictions for the effect of correlations , we have simulated the transmission of classical particles through a lvy glass , confined to a slab of thickness @xmath0 . both a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system of discs is considered and a three - dimensional ( 3d ) system of spheres .",
    "we find a power law scaling @xmath16 with an exponent @xmath13 that lies well above the @xmath12 line expected for a lvy walk .",
    "in particular , we obtain a saturation of @xmath13 at the diffusive value of unity well before the @xmath17 threshold is reached of a divergent second moment .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . since",
