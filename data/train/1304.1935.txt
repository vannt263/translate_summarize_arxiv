    "multiple - antenna wireless communication systems can exploit the spatial diversity in wireless channels , mitigating the effects of fading and enhancing their performance and capacity . due to the size and cost of mobile terminals",

    "are proposed .",
    "a scheme that jointly considers the power allocation across the relays subject to group - based power constraints and the design of linear receivers for interference suppression is proposed .",
    "the idea of a group - based power allocation constraint is shown to yield close to optimal performance , while keeping the signalling and complexity requirements low .",
    "a constrained minimum mean - squared error ( mmse ) design for the receive filters and the power allocation vectors is developed along with an mmse channel estimator for the cooperative system under consideration .",
    "the linear mmse receiver design is adopted due to its mathematical tractability and good performance .",
    "however , the incorporation of more sophisticated detection strategies including interference cancellation with iterative decoding @xcite-@xcite and advanced parameter estimation methods @xcite-@xcite are also possible . in order to solve the proposed optimization problem efficiently , a method to form an effective group of users and an alternating optimization strategy are presented with recursive alternating least squares ( rals ) algorithms for estimating the parameters of the receiver , the power allocation and the channels .",
