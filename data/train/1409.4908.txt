    "while precise control of non - classical interference has been demonstrated in two - arm mach - zehnder interferometers fabricated using planar silica - on - silicon  @xcite and uv - writing technologies  @xcite , these platforms require multiports to be implemented as multimode interference devices  @xcite , which have low fabrication tolerances , or as complex concatenations of 50/50 beamsplitters and phase shifters  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we employed the femtosecond laser direct - write ( fldw ) technique  @xcite to enable stable multi - arm quantum interferometry in a 40  mm long alumino - borosilicate glass chip ( see methods ) .",
    "the middle interferometer arm was raised 127 @xmath1 m above the other two arms to allow for interaction with a heating element mounted on the chip surface that acts as a thermo - optic phase shifter ( see fig .",

    "the fabricated three - arm interferometer was excited using photons from a type i spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) source that produced degenerate photons at 804  nm .",

    "single photon detection was performed using silicon avalanche photodiodes ( see methods for details ) .      in characterising the device ,",
    "the majority of losses occur outside the chip in the form of coupling losses at the facets and detector efficiencies , while low propagation losses are achieved in the waveguide section  @xcite .",
    "the interferometer may thus be well approximated mathematically by an operation @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the relative phase applied to the middle interferometer arm which we control using a heating element mounted on the glass surface ( see fig .",

    "a state @xmath4 injected into the device evolves into the state @xmath5 , and in the photon spatial mode basis representation the unitary operator takes the form of a @xmath6 matrix connecting the input modes @xmath7 to the output modes @xmath8 ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "@xmath9    the nonlinear relationship between the induced phase @xmath3 and the applied voltage @xmath10 was established by single - photon characterisation of the nine possible classical interference patterns , examining the count rates from each pair of output ports for separate excitation of each input port . performing single - photon measurements",
    "using the same spdc source allowed us to ensure consistency between our classical characterisation and the subsequent non - classical study .",
    "the measured counts as a function of voltage when injecting into input port  1 are shown in fig  [ fig : fringes](a ) . since the input and output coupling losses at each port",
    "@xmath11 are unknown , the unitary matrix elements @xmath12 at each voltage were determined by maximum - likelihood estimation applied to ratios of the measured count rates that are independent of the facet losses  @xcite ( see supplementary material ) .",

    "we then proceeded to the quantum characterisation of the tunable device by injecting photon pairs into each combination of input ports , corresponding to the fock states @xmath19 .",

    "this leads to both constructive interference in which a coincidence peak is observed or destructive interference , seen as a coincidence dip , as the relative phase @xmath3 is tuned by the thermo - optic element .",

    "a fisher information of @xmath50 , where @xmath0 is the number of photons in the probe state , is required to realize a quantum enhancement in an interferometric phase measurement  @xcite .",

    "the variation of the fisher information with the phase @xmath3 leads to a measurement precision that depends on the unknown phase .",
    "this , however may be counteracted by making use of an adaptive measurement scheme in which the device is tuned back to the value of @xmath3 corresponding to the optimal @xmath42 using an adjustable feedback phase  @xcite .",
    "such a scheme can be straightforwardly implemented in our device by using the demonstrated thermo - optic phase shifter as feedback , while the unknown phase would be imparted by another element such as a microfluidic channel  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the phase @xmath3 in this device remained stable over the full duration of the experiment and that the measured visibilities were reproduced within the given errors despite the modest effort taken to stabilize it against temperature fluctuations and vibration .",
    "the stability and reproducibility of the phase supports the utility of our device for the adaptive measurement schemes described above .",
    "this is contrasted with equivalent fibre devices that have been reported to date , in which thermal fluctuations of the optical path of several wavelengths limited the study to a characterisation with a classical laser source  @xcite . placing separate phase shifters on another one of the interferometer",
    "arms would allow for the simultaneous measurement of two phases  @xcite .",
    "this is a new and mostly unexplored type of measurement that is unique to multi - arm devices such as the one reported here .",

    "we have reported the first experimental demonstration of quantum interferometry in a 3d tunable laser - written three - port interferometer . the integrated geometry provided by fldw enables improved stability compared to fibre and bulk set - ups , and",
    "the tunability illustrates the enhanced sensitivity achievable using non - classical states . the combination of high stability , robust 3d fabrication and tunability makes this device an ideal platform for practical and highly sensitive quantum sensing and an enabling technology for new multi - parameter estimation experiments",
