    "hawking radiation is one of the most important predictions in black hole physics .",
    "a simple proof of it was given by damour and ruffini @xcite who used a tortoise coordinate to write the radial part of the klein - gordon equation in the form of the @xmath0 equation , and then found that there is a potential barrier outside the horizon , and hence implies that black holes can radiate .",
    "there is a long list of research papers on this in the literature @xcite @xcite @xcite . in the presence of a cosmological constant @xmath1 ,",
    "the schwarzschild solution is replaced by the schwarzschild - de sitter solution which contains two event horizons  an inner black hole horizon and an outer cosmological horizon .",
    "we are living in between these two horizons .",
    "it is known that hawking radiation also exists in this case @xcite @xcite @xcite . however , because @xmath1 is small , its influence on the radiation is expected to be small , too .    in kaluza - klein",
    "as well as string / brane theories , it is assumed that there exists compact or non - compact extra spatial dimensions .",
    "it is known that the 4d schwarzschild - de sitter black hole solution can be embedded into a 5d ricci - flat manifold with the following metric @xcite @xcite @xcite @xmath2-d\\xi^{2 } , \\label{eq:5dmetric}%\\ ] ] where @xmath3 the term inside the square bracket is exactly the same line - element as the 4d schwarzschild - de sitter solution .",
    "therefore , when viewed from a @xmath4 hypersurface , the 4d line - element represents exactly the schwarzschild - de sitter black hole .",
    "however , when viewed from 5d , the horizon does not form a 4d sphere .",
    "it looks like a black string lying along the fifth dimension .",
    "usually , people call the solution of the 5d equation @xmath5 the 5d schwarzschild - de sitter solution .",
    "therefore , to distinguish it , we call the solution ( [ eq:5dmetric ] ) a black string , or more precisely , a 5d ricci - flat schwarzschild - de sitter solution , because ( [ eq:5dmetric ] ) satisfies the 5d vacuum equation @xmath6 .",
    "so , for ( [ eq:5dmetric ] ) there is no cosmological constant when viewed from 5d .",
    "however , when viewed from 4d , there is an effective cosmological constant .",
    "this solution has been studied in many works",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite focusing mainly on the induced cosmological constant , the extra force and so on . to our knowledge , no one has studied the radiation of this 5d solution before . because the black hole radiation could hopefully be detected in the near future , and",
    "because recent cosmological observations favor the @xmath1 model for dark energy , here we will study the black hole radiation of this 5d solution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we use the method of separation of variables to analyze the 5d klein - gordon equation . in section 3",
    ", we use the r - s type brane model as a boundary condition to solve the equation for the fifth dimension . in section 4",
    ", we return to the radial equation and obtain the potential barrier and analyze its spectrum .",
    "section 5 is a discussion .",
    "we use a coordinate transformation @xmath7 and rewrite the 5d metric ( [ eq:5dmetric ] ) as @xmath8,\\label{eq:5dmetric - y}%\\ ] ] where y is the new coordinate of the fifth dimension .",
    "the horizons of the 5d metric ( [ eq:5dmetric - y ] ) are on the hypersurface @xmath9 , which has three solutions @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the black hole horizon , @xmath12 is the cosmological horizon , and we are living in between these two horizons .",
    "another solution @xmath13 is negative and physically meaningless .",
    "we consider a massless scalar field @xmath14 in the 5d spacetime ( [ eq:5dmetric - y ] ) .",
    "the klein - gordon equation for @xmath14 is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the 5d dalembertian operator . using the method of separation of variables",

    "the wave function @xmath23 is governed by eq .",

    "( [ 5-d - function ] ) , respectively .    because @xmath23 represents the wave function along the @xmath32-direction for a massless scalar particle and @xmath33 represents the probability of finding the particle , a boundary condition should be used to make @xmath23 finite everywhere .",
    "a simple way is to use the r - s two - brane model @xcite @xcite , in which the fifth dimension is a line segment",
    ". the length of this line could be very small @xcite , or could be very large @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the two branes are at @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , and that we live on the @xmath34 brane",
    ". then @xmath23 should reach its maximum at @xmath34 .",
    "it is shown that the first equation in eqs .",
    "( [ 5-d - function ] ) gives a discrete spectrum for @xmath23 , and the second and third equations give continuous spectra .",
    "we discuss them in the following subsections .",
    "for the first solution of eqs .",
    "( [ 5-d - function ] ) , it is expected that the wave function @xmath23 should reach its maximum on our brane @xmath34 , and hence @xmath37 is obtained",
    ". then we expect that the cosine function in eqs .",
    "( [ 5-d - function ] ) looks like a standing wave between the two branes , so we have @xmath38 and the quantized discrete spectra for @xmath21 and @xmath23 are obtained as follows : @xmath39 it is easy to verify that the corresponding eigenvalue equation and the operator for @xmath40 are @xmath41 for @xmath42 , the first ( ground ) eigenfunction is @xmath43 . for @xmath44 and @xmath45 ,",
    "the second and third eigenfunctions are @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "these three eigenfunctions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : quan - state1 ] .",
    "it is clear that @xmath48 starts from the value @xmath49 but does not end exactly at the value @xmath50 .",
    "this is due to the effect of the exponential factor @xmath51 in @xmath48 in eq .",

    "( [ 5-d - function ] ) .",
    "we rewrite these as follow : @xmath60 because @xmath21 is continuous , the wave function @xmath23 is also continuous . here",
    ", just as the discrete case , we require that the wave function @xmath23 starts from the maximum on the @xmath34 brane and decreases as @xmath32 increases . under this requirement the case @xmath61 contains two modes : for ( @xmath62 ) , @xmath23 decreases slightly because of the small @xmath1 . for ( @xmath63 )",
    ", it decreases almost linearly to @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath64 case is a little more complicated because both @xmath32 and @xmath21 can vary .",

    "now we return to the radial eq .",
    "( [ radius - t - equation ] ) . here @xmath69 can be eliminated by using @xmath70 and hence eq . ( [ radius - t - equation ] )",

    "the potential barrier @xmath81 determines the reflection and the transmission coefficients of the scalar massless particles , and the non - zero reflection coefficient indicates the existence of hawking radiation .",
    "now we consider the potential barrier @xmath81 ( [ potential of r ] ) where @xmath21 can take a continues value if @xmath59 , or a discrete value if @xmath82 . in the latter discrete case , @xmath81 takes the form @xmath83.\\ ] ] from this equation it is obvious that if @xmath84 is very small , the potential barrier @xmath85 will be very large .",
    "however , the potential barrier for the 4d schwarzschild - de sitter solution corresponds to @xmath86 . to make the 5d and 4d cases comparable , a very large 5th dimension for @xmath84 have to be chosen .",
    "this enables us to plot the first three quantized potential barriers @xmath87 , as well as the 4d ( @xmath86 ) case , in fig .",
    "[ fig : quan - potential - r ] .     with @xmath42 (",
    "dotted ) , @xmath44 ( dashed ) , and @xmath45 ( dash - dot ) with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath56 and @xmath90 ( a very large 5th dimension ) .",
    "the potential barriers of the corresponding 4d solution ( @xmath86 ) is also plotted for comparison .",
    "the black hole horizon ( point a ) has @xmath91 and the cosmological horizon ( point b ) has @xmath92 and the potential tends to zero quickly as @xmath93,width=336 ]",
    "the 4d schwarzschild - de sitter black hole solution can be embedded into the 5d ricci - flat solution ( [ eq:5dmetric ] ) .",
    "we have analyzed the nature of a massless scalar particle moving in the 5d solution ( [ eq:5dmetric ] ) , by solving the corresponding 5d klein - gordon eq .",
    "( [ klein - gorden equation ] ) under the assumption of separability .",
    "we have assigned boundary condition in the 5th dimension by using a two - brane randall - sundrum model . the separation constant @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ 5-th - equation ] ) for the extra dimension plays a critical role , since its value leads to both quantized and continuous spectra .",
    "when @xmath21 is inserted into the radial eq .",
    "( [ radius - t - equation ] ) , we find that by using the tortoise coordinate ( [ tortoise ] ) we obtain a one - dimensional @xmath0 eq .",
    "( [ radius - equation ] ) in which quantized potential barriers differ significantly from the usual 4d case .",
    "( the latter is recovered for @xmath86 , whereas in the 5d case @xmath21 takes discrete values for @xmath94 and continuous values for @xmath95 . ) now in a usual language , as the potential barrier becomes higher , the reflection of waves become more efficient and the black hole radiation is more intensive .",
    "thus we conclude that the existence and structure of the 5th dimension can in principle be investigated by data about the 4d hawking radiation around black hole .    here",
    "we should emphasize that in the brane - world scenario , all standard particles and forces , except gravity , are confined on the branes .",
    "this implies that the 5d energy and pressure densities ( including a possible positive or negative cosmological constant ) are singular at the branes .",
    "usually , this is treated by using their 4d counterparts ( which are finite ) multiplied by a delta function .",
    "it is known that a delta function can be approximately described by a series of periodic function . in this case , although the delta function itself is singular at the brane , each of its component function is not necessarily be singular there . in other words , if we only focus on a single mode of the series , the wave function for this mode may reach the maximum value but keep smooth and finite at the brane . with this purpose in mind , we have used the rs2-type brane model to give the required boundary conditions .",
    "this is because in the rs2 brane model , the 5th dimension @xmath32 could be very large and the second brane could be pushed far away even to infinity .",
    "this is just what we want in our paper because the potential barrier @xmath87 tends to its 4d gr value for @xmath96 as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ quan - potential ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , the 4d spacetime on the brane in our case takes exactly the same form as the 4d schwarzschild - de sitter solution which is 5d empty .",
    "therefore , there would be no brane if we do not consider the contribution of the wave function of the scalar field . the wave function , especially @xmath23 ,",
    "plays the role to provide a kind of brane which is similar to the one in the rs2 model .",
    "for instance , a suitable superposition of some of the quantized or / and continuous components of @xmath23 may provide a wave function which is very large at @xmath34 and drops rapidly for @xmath97 and thus forms a practical brane at the @xmath34 hypersurface .",
