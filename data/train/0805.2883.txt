    "the study of spectral and localization properties of one - dimensional ( 1d ) random hamiltonians has stimulated a huge activity since the pioneering works of dyson  @xcite , schmidt  @xcite , frisch & lloyd  @xcite , lifshits  @xcite and many others ( references to the most important works may be found in the review article @xcite and the books @xcite ) .",
    "because the dimension plays an important role in localization problems  @xcite , the strictly one - dimensional situation misses some features of higher dimension case ( like a weak localization regime ) . on the other hand",
    "the one - dimensional case allows to make use of powerful nonperturbative methods and study subtle properties which are much more difficult to tackle in higher dimensions .",
    "the random schrdinger hamiltonians @xmath20 , where @xmath7 is a random function , have been studied in great detail  @xcite and their properties are rather generic under the asumption that @xmath7 is correlated on a small length scale and @xmath21 remains finite with @xmath22 ( the case @xmath23 corresponds to a brownian motion ) . ]  : exponential tail in the density of states can also presents power - law singularity  : for a random potential describing a weak concentration of impurities of negative weights , each trapping a localized state at energy @xmath24 , the spectrum presents a power law singularity near @xmath25 , with an exponent proportional to the concentration of impurities  ; such a singularity is called a halperin singularity  @xcite ) . ] at low energies ( lifshits singularity )  @xcite and decreasing lyapunov exponent ( inverse localization length ) at high energy  @xcite @xmath26 for @xmath27",
    ". the situation can be quite different if the hamiltonian possesses some symmetry preserved by the introduction of the random potential .",
    "such a situation occurs in the case of supersymmetric random hamiltonian @xmath28 this hamiltonian has a positive spectrum , a direct consequence of the fact that it can be factorized in the form @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , it is worth pointing out that @xmath32 and its supersymmetric partner @xmath33 are the two components of the square of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are pauli matrices  : @xmath36 . therefore the hamiltonian ( [ hsusy ] ) arises naturally when studying random dirac hamiltonians .",
    "besides its own interest for the physics of localization , this model is relevant in several physical contexts like classical diffusion in a random force field ( sinai problem )  @xcite ( see    [ sec : motiv ] below ) , organic conductors  @xcite or spin chains ( the spectrum of excitations of an antiferromagnetic spin - chain is linear at small energies like in free fermion model  ; the precise mapping of af spin - chain to free fermions can be achieved thanks to a jordan - wigner transformation )  @xcite  ; see the review provided in ref .",
    "the relation to discrete models has been discussed  : the supersymmetric hamiltonian is the continuum limit of a discrete tight - binding hamiltonian with off - diagonal disorder  @xcite .",
    "it is also the continuum limit of a tight - binding hamiltonian with diagonal disorder at the band center  @xcite ( this point has been recently rediscussed in @xcite ) .",
    "the supersymmetry is responsible for rather particular spectral and localization properties . for",

    ", @xmath39 , the integrated density of states ( idos ) presents the dyson singularity @xmath40  @xcite , similar to the one of the spring chain with random masses  @xcite or anderson model with random hoppings  @xcite .",
    "the lyapunov exponent vanishes as @xmath41  @xcite ( also obtained for discrete models in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , indicating a delocalization transition .",
    "this delocalization transition is suported by studying other quantities  : ( _ i _ ) statistical properties of the zero mode wave function @xcite indicate long range power law correlations ( like the lyapunov exponent analysis , these calculations do not account for boundary conditions ) .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the distribution of the transmission probability through a finite slab of length @xmath42 at zero energy .",
    "in particular the average transmission decreases like @xmath43  @xcite , that is slower than the behaviour @xmath44 for a quasi 1d conducting weakly disordered wire .",
    "( _ iii _ ) time delay distribution presents a log - normal distribution at zero energy  @xcite .",
    "( _ iv _ ) the conductivity is found to be finite at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "( _ v _ ) finally , the study of extreme value statistics of energy levels indicates spectral correlations for @xmath5  @xcite . in the high energy limit @xmath45 , the localization properties are quite unusual since the lyapunov exponent does not vanish but reaches a finite value @xmath46 .",
    "this property is due to the singular nature of the potential @xmath47 with @xmath48 a white noise .",
    "when the potential is regularized by introducing a small but finite correlation length , it has been shown in @xcite that the lyapunov exponent decreases as @xmath26 for largest energies , as for the random hamiltonian @xmath20 .",

    "@xcite , where spectrum and localization have been studied for the most general random dirac 1d hamiltonian ( random mass , random scalar field , random gauge field ) , however such a study still preserves the ( particle - hole ) symmetry of the hamiltonian ( note that the distribution of the local dos for this model has been investigated in ref .",
    "the aim of the present article is to discuss the effect of the addition of a scalar random potential that breaks the supersymmetry  : @xmath50 we will mostly consider the case when the functions @xmath48 and @xmath51 are two uncorrelated gaussian white noises with variances @xmath38 and @xmath52 . the case with a finite @xmath53 will be studied in the section  [ sec : replica ] with the replica method .",
    "the case of correlated gaussian white noises @xmath48 and @xmath51 will be discussed in the appendix  [ app : corrnoises ] where it is mapped onto the problem of uncorrelated noises .",
    "our purpose is to study how spectral and localization properties of @xmath54 are modified when introducing the scalar potential .",
    "a first obvious change is that the spectrum of @xmath55 is not restricted to be positive .",
    "natural questions are therefore  : what is the number of states sent to @xmath56 by the introduction of the potential @xmath7 , how their energies are distributed  ? how the delocalization at @xmath5 for the hamiltonian @xmath54 is affected  ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after giving a physical motivation for our model right hereafter , we study spectral and localization properties of @xmath55 in sections [ sec : spec ] and [ sec : loc ] respectively .",
    "our approach relies on well - established techniques of stochastic differential equations . in section [ sec : replica ] , we employ the replica method in order to find other analytical expressions for the idos and the lyapunov exponent and consider the more general case of a finite  @xmath53 .",
    "let us first recall the well - known relation between the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) describing classical diffusion in a force field @xmath1 and the schrdinger equation for a potential @xmath47 .",
    "let us consider the langevin equation @xmath57 , where the langevin force @xmath58 is a normalized white noise .",
