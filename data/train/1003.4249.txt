    "a long standing quest of theories of particle physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is to formulate a theory of quark and charged lepton masses and quark mixings . in recent years",
    ", this quest has been extended to include the neutrino masses and lepton mixing as a result of tremendous experimental advances and discoveries in neutrino physics .",
    "indeed , perhaps the greatest advance in particle physics over the past dozen years has been the measurement of neutrino masses and mixing involving two large mixing angles associated with atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation experiments , while the remaining mixing angle , although unmeasured , is constrained by reactor neutrino oscillation experiments to be relatively small .",
    "the empirical observation of tb lepton mixing @xcite contrasts sharply with the smallness of quark mixing , and this observation , together with the smallness of neutrino masses , provides new and tantalising clues in the search for the origin of quark and lepton flavour in terms of a theory of flavour that would supersede the sm .",
    "tb lepton mixing in particular hints at a spontaneously broken family symmetry @xmath2 which might underpin a flavour theory of all quarks and leptons , but which might only reveal itself in the neutrino sector .",
    "what is the nature of such a family symmetry ? in the ( diagonal ) charged lepton mass basis , it has been shown that the neutrino mass matrix leading to tb mixing is invariant under ( off - diagonal ) transformations @xmath3 and @xmath4 which constitute the klein group@xcite . and @xmath4 could as well be represented by diagonal matrices . ]",
    "the observed neutrino flavour symmetry corresponding to the two generators @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the klein group may arise either directly or indirectly from certain classes of discrete groups @xcite .",
    "several models have been constructed that account for the structure of leptonic mixings , e.g. @xcite , while other models extend the underlying family symmetry to provide a description of the complete fermionic structure @xcite .",
    "if the neutrino flavour symmetry arises directly from the family symmetry @xcite then this implies that the family symmetry should contain the generators @xmath3 and @xmath4 so that they can be preserved in the neutrino sector at lo .",
    "the smallest group that contains the generators @xmath3 and @xmath4 together with a ( diagonal ) phase matrix @xmath5 is @xmath6 @xcite and the models found in @xcite are based on @xmath6 .",
    "the fact that it is possible to construct direct models based on the family symmetry @xmath7 ( generated by @xmath3 and @xmath5 only ) is owed to the required absence of family symmetry breaking fields ( flavons ) in the representations @xmath8 and @xmath9 of @xmath7 . in such @xmath7 models",
    "the symmetry associated with the generator @xmath4 arises accidentally at lo @xcite .    despite the plethora of models",
    ", there are surprisingly few which successfully combine a discrete family symmetry containing triplet representations ( necessary to account for tb mixing ) together with a gut .",
    "examples are the @xmath10 models @xcite , the @xmath11 model @xcite , the @xmath12 models @xcite , the @xmath13 models @xcite , the @xmath14 model @xcite , and the @xmath15 models @xcite . the possible combination @xmath0 stands out in the sense that it combines the minimal gut with the minimal choice of family symmetry , which contains the generators @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we construct a susy gut of flavour based on @xmath0 in which the @xmath16 matter fields of @xmath17 are assigned to a triplet of @xmath6 , while the @xmath18 matter fields are in a doublet plus a ( trivial ) singlet of @xmath6 .",
    "the operators are also controlled by an additional @xmath19 symmetry which segregates different types of flavons into different ( charge ) sectors at lo , e.g. flavons , whose vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) preserve the generators @xmath3 and @xmath4 , only couple to neutrinos at lo .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath19 symmetry controls the amount of flavon contamination between different sectors beyond lo .",
    "we shall show that the model predicts tb neutrino mixing very accurately up to corrections of order 0.1% at the gut scale . in order to do so , we specify the complete effective theory , valid just below the gut scale , and perform a full operator analysis of all relevant terms including several flavons .",
    "furthermore , we make an exhaustive study of vacuum alignment to nlo arising from the @xmath1-terms of driving fields .",
    "these fields are , similar to the flavons , gauge singlets which only transform non - trivially under @xmath20 .",
    "the model leads to a successful description of quark and charged lepton masses and quark mixing angles , including the gst relation between down and strange quark masses and the cabibbo angle @xmath21 @xcite , and the gj relations between charged lepton and down quark masses @xcite , with bottom - tau yukawa unification .",
    "the gj factor is also responsible for the ( left - handed ) charged lepton mixing angle @xmath22 being @xmath23 . including corrections due to non - zero mixing in the charged lepton sector induces deviations from tb lepton mixing expressed in a lepton mixing sum rule @xcite with a reactor mixing angle of order @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath25 and @xmath26 , maximal atmospheric mixing holds to good precision at the gut scale .",
    "we note that in the realisation of the model we discuss in detail , small and moderate values of @xmath27 , the ratio of the vevs of the two electroweak higgs doublets present in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , are preferred because the hierarchy among the top and the bottom quark mass is accounted for by the family symmetry .",
    "since our main concern in this work is the explanation of fermion masses and mixings , we leave aside the problem of constructing a gut higgs ( super-)potential ensuring the correct breaking of the gauge group @xmath17 to the sm .",
    "we remark that an @xmath0 model has also been proposed in @xcite , in which , however , nlo corrections as well as the vacuum alignment of the flavons are not studied in detail .",
    "by contrast in the different @xmath0 model proposed here the lo predictions are robust against the nlo corrections which are explicitly calculated and shown to be small .",
    "furthermore , the alignment of the flavon vevs is a natural result of the flavon superpotential .",
    "the latter is thoroughly investigated to nlo .",
    "the layout of the remainder of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we define the susy @xmath28 model for a general class of @xmath19 charges and discuss the results for fermion masses and mixings at lo . in section 3",
    "we perform an operator analysis of all relevant terms including several flavon fields . in this context , we introduce the notion of desired , dangerous , marginal and irrelevant operators .",
    "we find 26 possible @xmath19 charge assignments which neither lead to dangerous nor to marginal operators .",
    "section 4 contains a study of the vacuum alignment which justifies the alignments assumed in previous sections . on the basis of the results of the analysis of higher - order terms disturbing this alignment and of the possibility to correlate the vevs of different flavons we choose the actual @xmath19 charges . in section 5",
    "we discuss the nlo corrections to yukawa couplings and to the flavon superpotential for a particular choice of @xmath19 charges and show that all corrections induced to fermion masses and mixings are small .",
    "section 6 concludes the paper .",
    "the first three appendices contain the group theory of @xmath6 , an example of messengers generating the operators giving rise to the gj and the gst relations , and the list of dangerous and marginal operators with less than four flavons contributing to the fermion mass matrices , according to the classification introduced in section 3 .",
    "appendix  d is dedicated to a discussion of how to ensure that the family symmetry is broken in the susy limit and how to ( further ) reduce the number of free parameters among the flavon vevs introducing additional driving fields and using couplings with positive mass dimension .",
    "in this section we present the model and discuss the lo result for fermion masses and mixings . in table  [ model ] we show the superfield charge assignments of our susy gut of flavour based on @xmath0 . for convenience the group theory of @xmath6 is summarised in appendix  a. the @xmath16 matter fields @xmath1 of @xmath17 are assigned to a triplet of @xmath6 , while the ten - dimensional matter fields are assigned to a doublet @xmath5 plus the trivial singlet @xmath30 of @xmath6 .",
    "the right - handed neutrinos @xmath31 are taken to be a triplet of @xmath6 , analogous to the @xmath7 see - saw models in @xcite , however there are some differences in the neutrino sector , as discussed below .",
    "the gut higgs fields @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are all singlets under the family symmetry @xmath6 .",
    "symmetry might be broken by an additional @xmath35 higgs field which can be rendered irrelevant for the yukawa operators by suitable charges under the @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath36 higgs field which should be added due to anomaly cancellation may similarly decouple from the up quark sector .",
    "therefore we disregard these higgs fields in the following .",
    "since the actual construction of a gut higgs ( super-)potential is beyond the scope of this work , we do not specify further flavon fields which might be necessary in order to allow relevant couplings in this ( super-)potential , which were otherwise forbidden by the @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "an alternative possibility to achieve the breaking of the gut symmetry might arise from appropriately chosen boundary conditions in an extra - dimensional scenario , see @xcite . in this case also the problem related to the splitting of doublets and colour triplets is elegantly solved .",
    "] we note that these higgs representations each contain a higgs doublet .",
    "the mssm higgs doublets @xmath37 and @xmath38 then originate from , respectively , @xmath39 and one linear combination of the doublets in @xmath33 and @xmath40 .",
    "invariant couplings between @xmath33 and @xmath40 in order to introduce mixing among their higgs doublet components . ]",
    "the @xmath34 component within @xmath38 is responsible for the gj relations between charged lepton and down quark masses @xcite .",
    "concerning the other ( orthogonal ) linear combination we assume that it decouples from the low - energy theory by acquiring a gut scale mass just as the colour triplets , contained in the gut higgs fields , and other non - mssm states @xcite .",
    "the ( light ) mssm higgs doublets @xmath41 acquire vevs @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , we introduce a number of flavon fields @xmath44 .",
    "an important feature of the model is that different flavons couple to different sectors of the theory at lo .",
    "the flavons @xmath44 are labelled both by the representation @xmath45 of @xmath6 under which they transform ( @xmath46 ) and by the fermion sector @xmath47 to which they couple at lo , namely @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 up to the difference in the gj factor .",
    "thus , for example , at lo , the flavon doublet @xmath51 appears only with @xmath52 , the flavon triplet @xmath53 appears only with @xmath54 , while the neutrino flavons @xmath55 only appear with @xmath56 .",
    "notice that @xmath55 consist of singlet , doublet and ( primed ) triplet representations with vacuum alignments which preserve the generators @xmath3 and @xmath4 contained in @xmath6 leading to tb neutrino mixing .",
    "the segregation of the different flavons , coupling to distinct sectors , at the lo level is achieved through an additional @xmath19 symmetry . for the time being , we assume this symmetry to be global in order to avoid constraints coming from the requirement of anomaly cancellation",
    ". the @xmath19 charges of the fields are expressed in terms of three integers @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , as shown in table  [ model ] .",
    "note that the higgs fields @xmath32 and @xmath33 are taken to be neutral under this symmetry .",
    "the family symmetry @xmath6 is only broken spontaneously by flavon vevs in our model . on the other hand , the spontaneous breakdown of the global @xmath19 symmetry leads to the appearance of a ( very light ) goldstone boson unless the @xmath19 is also explicitly broken .",
    "for this reason we assume a scenario in which the @xmath19 symmetry is explicitly broken in the hidden sector of the theory which is also responsible for susy breaking , so that the soft terms do not respect the @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "then the would - be goldstone boson will have a mass of the order of the soft susy mass scale of around @xmath60 tev .",
    "alone is sufficient to constrain the soft mass terms of sfermions in such a way that all bounds associated with flavour changing neutral current and lepton flavour violating processes can be satisfied without tuning the soft mass parameters .",
    "] alternatively one could gauge the @xmath19 symmetry and add further particles in order to cancel the anomalies . as the set of these additional particles would depend on the explicit @xmath19 charge assignments",
    ", we do not follow this approach .    in our study , we disregard possible corrections to fermion masses and mixings which are due to deviations from the canonical normalisation of the khler potential .",
    "such deviations arise in general , if subleading corrections involving ( several ) flavons are taken into account .",
    "studies of the possible effects of non - canonically normalised kinetic terms on fermion masses and mixings can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "@xmath61    the lowest dimensional yukawa operators invariant under the family symmetry @xmath20 , contributing to the up quark mass matrix , are ( we omit order one coefficients in the following ) t_3t_3h^_5 + t t ^u_2 h^_5 + tt ^u_2 ^u_2 h^_5 .",

    "after presenting the lo result which incorporates the prediction of tb mixing in the neutrino sector and the successful accommodation of all charged fermion masses and quark mixings , we now discuss in more detail the role of the additional @xmath19 symmetry in forbidding all operators which would otherwise have a considerable effect on these lo results .",
    "for example , as already remarked , beyond the lo we expect the segregation of different flavons @xmath112 associated with a particular quark and lepton type @xmath113 to break down .    in order to identify operators which should be forbidden , we first classify them according to which contributions they give to the fermion mass matrices . in this analysis",

    "we discuss , in section 5 , the subleading corrections induced through shifts in the flavon vevs ( and subleading operators ) , showing that their effects on fermion masses and mixings are negligible .",
    "we can distinguish the following four types of yukawa operators    * _ desired _ operators : these are the operators which - by definition of the @xmath19 charges - are present at lo , see eqs .",
    "( [ uplo],[downlo],[nulo ] ) . * _ dangerous _ operators : these operators strongly perturb the form of the mass matrices achieved at lo . in the case of charged fermions their contribution is larger than the one stemming from the desired operators . in the case of right - handed neutrinos ,",
    "any contribution which is larger than or of the same order of magnitude in @xmath115 as the one coming from the desired operators has to be considered as dangerous because tb mixing crucially depends on the form of the right - handed neutrino mass matrix as well as on the fact that all entries of the latter are of the same order of magnitude in @xmath115 . *",
    "_ marginal _ operators : these operators give contributions to charged fermion mass matrices which are of the same order in @xmath115 as the lo contribution .",
    "although not dangerous in the above sense , their presence has a significant impact on the final result .",
    "for example , in the case of the gst relation it might happen that such a marginal operator contributes differently to the @xmath87 and the @xmath88 elements of the down quark mass matrix @xmath74 so that the relation between the cabibbo angle and the masses of down and strange quark is lost .",

    "<S> we construct a supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theory ( gut ) of flavour based on @xmath0 , together with an additional ( global or local ) abelian symmetry , and study it to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy . </S>",

    "<S> including charged lepton mixing corrections implies small deviations from tb mixing described by a precise sum rule , accurately maximal atmospheric mixing and a reactor mixing angle close to three degrees . </S>"
