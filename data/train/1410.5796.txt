    "x - ray bursts ( xrbs ) are the thermonuclear runaway in a h / he layer on the surface of a neutron star .",
    "these transient events can be used to probe the structure of neutron stars and the equation of state of dense material  @xcite . furthermore , they are also the sites of rp - process nucleosynthesis  @xcite . for these reasons , understanding the dynamics of the explosion has seen substantial research interest in the past years .",
    "one - dimensional studies @xcite can reproduce the observed energies , durations , and recurrence timescales for xrbs , but use a parameterized model for convection , namely mixing length theory ( which likely does not describe turbulent convection accurately e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "an open question is whether a fully - turbulent convective velocity field can modify the nucleosynthesis .",
    "additionally , the convection may dredge up heavy element ash to the photosphere  @xcite thereby altering the opacity of the atmosphere , which affects the inference of neutron star mass and radius from photospheric radius expansion ( pre ) bursts .",
    "these are inherently three - dimensional problems .",
    "previously , we performed two - dimensional simulations , focusing first on pure he bursts @xcite , and then later on mixed h / he bursts @xcite .",
    "the latter study used an approximate network to capture the hot - cno , triple-@xmath0 , and initial rp - process breakout burning .",
    "there we found that we needed a spatial resolution of about 6  cm zone@xmath1 in order to accurately model the burning ; for comparison , the extremely temperature - sensitive burning of the pure he models of @xcite required 0.5  cm zone@xmath1 resolution . in this paper , we extend our studies by performing the first three - dimensional model of convective burning in a h / he xrb , using the reaction network from @xcite .",
    "this initial study compares to our two - dimensional results , and discusses the computational requirements for a more extensive study .",
    "we use the publicly - available maestro  code  @xcite , which solves the equations of low mach number hydrodynamics by reformulating the reactive euler equations to filter soundwaves while retaining compressibility effects due to stratification and local heat release . by filtering dynamically unimportant soundwaves",
    ", maestro  enables efficient simulation of slow convective flows , such as those in xrbs  @xcite , various progenitors of type ia supernovae  @xcite , and in the cores of massive stars  @xcite . also important for simulations like these",
    "is that the low mach number formulation analytically enforces hydrostatic equilibrium of the base state , allowing us to maintain a hydrostatic atmosphere in the simulation code without the development of large spurious velocities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "all of the maestro  options and microphysics used in our two - dimensional study of xrbs in @xcite are retained for this study . in particular",
    ", we use the new energy formulation variant of maestro , based on the ideas in @xcite and @xcite , which improves energy conservation and our treatment of gravity waves .",
    "we use the helmholtz equation of state ( eos ) from @xcite , which includes an ideal gas of nuclei , a photon gas , and an electron / positron gas with arbitrary degeneracy and relativistic parameters , and coulomb corrections .",
    "maestro  is under continuous development , and we ve improved the advection portion of the code since the construction of the interface states was last discussed in @xcite .",
    "we take the opportunity to document those changes in appendix  [ sec : godunov integration details ] .",
    "we use the same parametrized initial model as in our two - dimensional study .",
    "briefly , the model consists of a @xmath2 , @xmath3  km neutron star , of which we model the outer @xmath4  cm as an isothermal ( @xmath5  k ) , pure @xmath6 gas . on top of",
    "the neutron star is a warm accreted layer of mainly h / he fuel that is slightly metal - rich compared to solar , with cno metals tied up in @xmath7 and @xmath8 in a ratio comparable to their respective @xmath9-decay lifetimes . a smooth transition is applied between the density ( @xmath10  g @xmath11 ) and temperature ( @xmath12  k ) at the base of the accreted layer and the surface of the neutron star .",
    "the accreted layer is given an isentropic profile , making it convectively unstable , and the temperature decreases until a cutoff temperature is reached .",
    "the original extent of the convective region is @xmath13  cm .",
    "figure  [ fig : initial_model ] shows the density and temperature profile , along with the values of the cutoff densities that are part of the maestro  algorithm . for the three - dimensional simulations present here , the anelastic and base cutoff densities have been increased slightly to @xmath14 to better quench the dynamics above the atmosphere .",
    "the two - dimensional simulations used the same parameters as in @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to the appendix of @xcite for more details of our model construction procedure .",
    "finally we note that all of the problem setup files , inputs , and initial models for the runs presented here have been copied into the main maestro  code repository in exec / science / xrb_mixed/ , allowing anyone to rerun these simulations .    in this paper , we perform two three - dimensional simulations to assess the dynamics of the convective flow .",
    "we model the xrb using a plane - parallel geometry .",
    "our wide simulation uses a uniform grid of @xmath15 and our narrow simulation uses a grid of @xmath16 zones , both with 6  cm zone@xmath1 spatial resolution  the same resolution used in our two - dimensional study . as the simulation evolves , the one - dimensional hydrostatic base state that maestro  carries is allowed to expand due to the heating , following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "our reaction network contains 10 species , approximating hot cno , triple-@xmath0 , and rp - breakout burning up through @xmath6 , using the ideas from @xcite , but with modern reaction rates from reaclib  @xcite where available ( see the discussion in @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this is the same network used in @xcite , but with one important change .",
    "the convective flow field in @xcite showed signs of splitting into two distinct convective regions ( e.g. figure 7 of that paper ) .",
    "the split occured at a location of a secondary peak in energy generation , which grew with time ( figure 9 in that paper ) .",
    "we attributed this extra energy to the branching ratio , @xmath17 , of @xmath9-decay versus @xmath0-capture on @xmath18 as a breakout mechanism from the hot cno cycle .",
    "the precise location of the secondary peak in energy production was where the branching ratio favored the @xmath9-decay to @xmath19 ( see figure 10 of @xcite ) , followed by @xmath20 ; the approximate network converts @xmath21@xmath22p directly to @xmath8@xmath23 at a rate governed by the rate of p - capture on @xmath21 and @xmath17 .",
    "this coincidence of peak energy generation and @xmath17 transition was a red herring : the energy generation from the @xmath21@xmath24@xmath8 chain was insufficient to reproduce the production rate we witnessed .",
    "we know now that we erroneously had an additional term in the reaction network  based on legacy code  that attempted to model p - capture on @xmath6 to heavier elements .",
    "in particular , there was a kludge of a term involving @xmath25 to mimic the energy release of heavier element production , which should not have been included in the network .",
    "this `` reaction '' occured exactly at the secondary peak in energy generation and depletion of h , and its rate was sufficient to reproduce the energy production and its increase with time .",
    "we have since removed this feature of our network .",
    "all calculations in this paper , including the 2-d comparisons , use the corrected network , which is available in the maestro  distribution in microphysics / networks / rprox/.",
    "in order to understand how dimensionality affects our results , we compare to updated two - dimensional calculations based on @xcite . in particular , we use a 6  cm resolution @xmath26 zone calculation .",
    "figure  [ fig : dt ] shows the standard deviation of temperature ( compared to other zones at the same height ) as a function of height for the two- and three - dimensional runs , both at @xmath27  s. the overall trend is the same for the two calculations , with the magnitude of the temperature fluctuations in the convective region ( @xmath28 1400 cm to 3550 cm ) @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "figure  [ fig : temp ] shows the peak temperature and peak mach number as a function of time for the runs .",
    "we see that they closely track one another , but that in the wide three - dimensional simulation there more sporatic spikes to moderate mach number throughout the simulation . at the start of the calculation",
    ", there is always a period of transient behavior as the heating needs to set up a consistent convective velocity field , but the flow quickly settles down . for both simulations , the average mach number after the transient is about 0.1 ; in the longer - duration two - dimensional case , the mach number asymptotes to 0.1 . the temperature plots all track one another well .",
    "we did not run the three - dimensional calculation as long as the two - dimensional calculation , to conserve computational resources .",
    "it is interesting to note how the peak mach number translates into a timestep improvement compared to a fully compressible code . for this problem ,",
    "the sound speed in the atmosphere is greater the deeper one goes into the atmosphere , but the mach number is highest at the top of the atmosphere . as a result , the timestep increase will actually be better than the naive @xmath31 one would expect if the domain were uniform .",
    "a further complication is that , in the compressible code , when we reach the low density material at the top of the atmosphere that buffers us from the boundary , it is radiation pressure that dominates here , articially increasing the hydrodynamic soundspeed .",
    "this is a common limitation that arises from using an eos that includes radiation instead of modeling the radiation field itself . for comparison",
    ", we started the same xrb simulation ( in two dimensions ) in the castro  code  @xcite , and the average timestep after @xmath32  s of evolution was @xmath33  s. for the main three - dimensional maestro  calculation , the average timestep over the course of the entire simulation was @xmath34  s  a @xmath35 improvement .",
    "the convective velocity structure of the wide three - dimensional simulation is shown in figure  [ fig : vz ] , highlighting the vertical velocity .",
    "these two images are representative of the flow throughout the simulation .",
    "we do not see the tight layering that was apparent in the older two - dimensional simulations ( especially for narrower domains ; see figures 6 and 7 , and the discussion in section 4.2.1 of @xcite ) because of the fix to the reaction network discussed in section [ ssec : network_corrections ] . to better understand the difference in the nature of the convective flow , we need to examine the turbulent structure .    turbulence is known to behave differently between two and three dimensions ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . to get a feel for the turbulent nature of the convection in these simulations",
    ", we look at the kinetic energy power spectrum . following the discussion regarding turbulence in stratified flows in @xcite and references therein",
    ", we calculate a generalized kinetic energy density spectrum as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the fourier transform of @xmath38 with @xmath39 specifying the density weighting , @xmath40 is the surface defined by @xmath41 , and the @xmath42 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "we note that here we use @xmath43 , the local velocity on the grid , instead of explicitly calculating the turbulent velocity fluctuations from the full velocity field , including the base state expansion , @xmath44 , because @xmath43 is essentially the velocity perturbations on top of an otherwise hydrostatic background state  @xcite .",
    "the volume , @xmath45 , and surface element , @xmath46 , are based on the dimensionality of the problem .",
    "the goal is to find the proper scaling of the energy density spectrum with wavenumber for both two- and three - dimensional flow .",
    "the units of @xmath47 are [ g@xmath48 @xmath49 s@xmath1 ] , where the extra power of @xmath51 on the length scale comes from the integral over @xmath52 in the definition of the fourier transform . in equation  ,",
    "the integral is done in @xmath53-space , such that @xmath54 with units [ @xmath55 , whereas the normalization is in real - space , so that @xmath45 has units of [ @xmath56 . upon integration of equation  ,",
    "the dimensionality , @xmath51 , drops out of the equation , and the units of the generalized kinetic energy density spectrum become [ g@xmath57 @xmath58 s@xmath59 for both two- and three - dimensional configurations . for turbulent flows that have density variation ( i.e.  compressible or stratified flows ) ,",
    "the typical kolmogorov energy dissipation rate , @xmath60 , at a given length scale @xmath61 should be weighted by the mass density  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) : @xmath62 , which has units of [ g cm@xmath1 s@xmath1 ] . the arguments of @xcite",
    "then apply to any dimension : the only combination of @xmath64 that yields a dimensionless quantity is when @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 . if the physics of two dimensional and three dimensional turbulence were the same ( this is likely not the case ) , then the spectrum defined in eq .   should scale as @xmath68 for both two- and three - dimensional flows .    in evaluating eq .",
    ", we create equally - spaced radial wavenumber bins , @xmath69 , ranging from the smallest physical wavenumber , @xmath70 , to the highest meaningful wavenumber , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the domain width .",
    "the fourier transform of the kinetic energy density gives us @xmath73 for each of points in the three - dimensional @xmath74 array , we define @xmath75 and determine which of the radial bins , @xmath69 , this falls into and add the value of @xmath74 to that bin s sum .",
    "done this way , we are integrating up in spherical shells in @xmath53-space , using our discrete bins .",
    "the same procedure is done in two dimensions , but now we are working in the @xmath76-@xmath77 plane , and are integrating up over annular regions in that plane , again defined by our discrete bins , @xmath69 .",
    "we do not worry about the @xmath78 normalization , since we will normalize each spectrum such that its peak value is 1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : turb ] shows the power spectrum of the two - dimensional and wide three - dimensional xrb simulations at @xmath79  s. for this analysis , we restrict the domain to just the vicinity of the convective region , including only the vertical range @xmath80 .",
    "for the three - dimensional case , we see that we have more than a decade in wavenumber where we achieve a @xmath68 power - law scaling , indicative of kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "we note that the region we are studying is not periodic in the vertical direction , but an fft assumes periodicity , so the discontinuity through the vertical boundary may affect the behavior at high wavenumbers , perhaps accounting for the slow fall in the three - dimensional spectrum .",
    "for the two - dimensional case , the spectrum starts off with a @xmath68 scaling , but then becomes steeper at moderate wavenumbers .",
    "such a break in the power law scaling for two - dimensional turbulence is predicted for very idealized turbulence where the steeper part of the curve has a @xmath81 scaling attributed to a cascade of enstrophy ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulation can not achieve the idealized conditions ( e.g.  infinte domain and infinite reynolds number ) assumed in the @xmath81 derivation , and sometimes achieve a steeper power law",
    "( e.g.  the review by * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in our two - dimensional simulation , we see a moderate range in the spectrum after the break consistent with @xmath81 .    we have also seen such a difference in scaling between two- and three - dimensional turbulence on smaller scales in reactive rayleigh - taylor simulations  @xcite , where we saw a spectrum that appeared to follow the @xmath82 scaling predicted by bolgiano - obukhov statistics for a two - dimensional cascade  @xcite . in that study , we found that a wide domain , giving more statistics , was essential to see this scaling .",
    "the difference in the scaling we observe in the present simulations suggests that there is a fundamental difference in how the cascade takes place between the two- and three - dimensional convection in xrbs .",
    "figure  [ fig : turb ] also shows that there is relatively more power in small scale ( higher wavenumber , @xmath53 ) features for the three - dimensional simulation compared to the two - dimensional calculation .",
    "this is made more explicit by looking at a colormap plot of the enstrophy density @xmath83 , as is shown in figure  [ fig : enstrophy ] , where the left ( right ) panel shows the two - dimensional ( three - dimensional ) simulation at @xmath84  s. the plot for the two - dimensional simulation is for the wide domain , but only half of the domain is shown to keep the same scale for both plots .",
    "for the three - dimensional simulation , the plot shows a slice through the center of the domain .",
    "the two - dimensional simulation plot appears to be dominated by moderate - sized vortices throughout the domain , while in three dimensions , we see structure on a much wider range of scales .",
    "this is similar to the results seen in comparisons of two- and three - dimensional simulations of novae  @xcite , although our two - dimensional results do not show as severe of a dominance of vortices as reported there .",
    "the panels of figure  [ fig : enstrophy ] also show that in two - dimensional flow the convective motions penetrate deeper into the underlying neutron star than in the three - dimensional case .",
    "this can have implications for the amount of metal - rich material that can be dredged up into the atmosphere , potentially polluting the photosphere and adjusting the opacity .",
    "we leave these details for a future paper .",
    "accurate analysis of the convection during a thermonuclear runaway is challenging .",
    "most convective analysis in the literature are focused on stellar convection , which reaches a steady - state . in that case",
    ", one can drop the time derivative in the energy equation and simply compare the balance of energy fluxes .",
    "a thermonuclear runaway is far from steady state .",
    "one can assume things are in a quasi - steady state over a somewhat short timescale and perform a rans - like averaging of the energy balance , but it is not _ a priori _ clear the exact duration of this averaging timescale .",
    "our data dumps are roughly once every eddy turnover time , which would likely not give good enough statistics for this approach .",
    "instead , we have , as in @xcite , focused on the adiabatic excess , @xmath85 : @xmath86 where the subscript @xmath87 indicates the profile along an adiabat .",
    "figure  [ fig : ad_excess ] shows the horizontal average of @xmath85 as a function of radius for both two- and three - dimensional simulations at @xmath84  s. this view of the convective region confirms that the extent of the convective overshoot region is less in three dimensions than in two dimensions , as was seen in the comparison of figure  [ fig : enstrophy ] ; in this snapshot , the average overshoot region in two dimensions is roughly 50% larger than that of the three - dimensional simulation .",
    "furthermore , the upper boundary in the two simulations is a bit different .",
    "the two dimensional simulation has a stronger degree of superadiabaticity , implying the thermal gradient is steeper than that of an adiabat .",
    "the three - dimensional simulation also appears to have , on average , a convectively stabilizing gradient around @xmath88  cm where the adiabatic excess becomes negative before a small overshoot region extends the convection to nearly the same distance as in the two - dimensional case .",
    "we described the first three - dimensional models of convective burning in an xrb .",
    "while the peak temperature and mach number behave qualitatively the same as our two - dimensional calculations , the structure of the convective velocity field differs substantially , both in the global appearance and in the turbulent statistics .",
    "this is illustrated well by the difference in appearance of the enstrophy density , which in three dimensions shows the typical cascade to small scales . since convective mixing is expected to distribute the synthesized nuclei throughout the atmosphere , potentially bringing some to the photosphere",
    ", modeling the convection accurately is important .",
    "based on the differences seen between the two - dimensional and three - dimensional flows , this suggests that three - dimensional models should be the focus of our future simulation efforts .",
    "the calculations presented here pave the way for a more detailed study of convective burning in xrbs .",
    "we plan to do a more thorough analysis of the convective flow patterns in both two and three dimensions in the future paper by including tracer particles in the flow .",
    "the tracers will help visualize the trajectory of the flow , and to build a statistical analysis of the transport during a thermonuclear runaway .",
    "the wide three - dimensional simulation used 2.8 m cpu - hours on the olcf titan system ( running with 768 mpi tasks and 16 threads per task ) .",
    "while maestro  can use amr , in these simulations we would refine the entire convective region , so the cost savings would be small . modifying the simulation to advect and store tracer particle information should increase the computational cost by only a few percent .",
    "our future calculations will push for increased realism of the reaction network . as detailed in @xcite ,",
    "the approximate network used here reasonably captures the overall energy release , but we plan to both improve the nuclear reaction network with a more clever selection of isotopes for an approximate network , and to investigate using larger networks whose integration can be accelerated using highly parallel hardware accelerators , such as gpus or intel xeon phi processors .",
    "thus far , we have only explored a single initial model , constructed with a simple parameterization .",
    "the real state of the accreted layer can vary , and there are two potential changes worth exploring .",
    "first , we extend the isentropic layer all the way to the surface of the model , but accretion would likely cause heating at the top of the atmosphere , which could truncate the convection region before the surface .",
    "this may prevent the convective plumes from reaching the steep density gradient at the very top of the atmosphere .",
    "second , our base density is on the higher end of likely models .",
    "we should explore lower density models as well .",
    "the burning in that case would not be as vigorous , but our timestep should increase as the convective velocity decreases , making these simulations feasible .",
    "an initial study of the initial model variations can be done in two dimensions , and then selected models can be run in three dimensions as needed .",
    "we also plan to push our calculations to larger scales . for the near future , however , these sort of calculations will be limited to convection - in - a - box studies . capturing the range of length scales necessary to follow a laterally propagating burning front , while resolving the energy - generation region , is not currently possible .",
    "the complementary approach to ours are the calculations by @xcite , which used wide - aspect ratio zones and did not perform hydrodynamics in the vertical direction .",
    "ultimately these two methods can inform one - another to build a picture of nucleosynthesis and dynamics of the burning front in xrbs .",
    "visualization was done with yt @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum calculation followed the `` making a turbulent kinetic energy power spectrum '' recipe in the yt cookbook .",
