    "it should be mentioned , however , that within this simple approach the period of modulation of the magnetic moment along @xmath16axis is uniquely determined by the propagation vector [ @xmath193 in our case ] .",

    "the phase difference between mn1/mn4 and mn2/mn3 sets of spins was estimated to be @xmath196 .",
    "the determined averaged mn moment is 1.55  @xmath20 , which is higher than the 1.29  @xmath20 in the fm state .",
    "the analysis of the high - pressure @xmath6sr data reveal that the new magnetic order appearing for pressures exceeding @xmath7  gpa can not be described by keeping the direction of the propagation vector unchanged .",
    "even the extreme case  decoupling the double - helical structure into four individual helices  remains inconsistent with the experiment .",
    "the experimental data are well described with the double spiral helimagnetic structure with the propagation vector @xmath197 and the @xmath4axis moment elongated by approximately 2% in comparison with the @xmath3axis one .",
    "the phase difference between mn1/mn2 and mn3/mn4 sets of moments and the value of the average magnetic moment @xmath114 were estimated to be @xmath198 and 1.287  @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the agreement between the contradicting neutron and @xmath6sr data on the one side,@xcite and the x - ray data on the other side,@xcite might be reached by assuming the tilt of the rotation plane towards @xmath16direction .",
