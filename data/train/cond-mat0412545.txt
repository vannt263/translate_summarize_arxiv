    "the problem of spin glass , with quenched disorder and frustration as main ingredients , is known to be a challenge in statistical mechanics.@xcite in order to reduce its complexity , it makes sense to discuss these ingredients separately .",
    "the aim of this work is to report numerical results on magnetic properties of a structure where frustration is present for purely antiferromagnetic interaction , with only one value of the exchange interaction .",
    "the interaction is limited to nearest neighbors .",
    "the structure studied is presented in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] .",
    "lattice , with the triangular lattice as a background . ]        our motivation to discuss this structure is as follows .",
    "first , the frustration is to be present , and the simplest way to achieve it is to put triangles into the lattice .",
    "second , the number of nearest neighbors is to be odd , what ensures that for any magnetic state , the energy barrier to flip a spin is finite .",
    "then we may expect that the magnetic transition temperature is greater than zero .",
    "third , we are interested in the ground state degeneracy .",
    "we look for a lattice where , if external field is zero , a simultaneous flip of some spins does not change the total energy .",
    "in fact , if the magnetization of the flipped group of spins is zero , the flipping does not change the energy even in the presence of the applied field .",
    "fourth , all distances between the nearest neighbors should be equal . additionally , two - dimensional structures are preferred for their simplicity .",
    "the structure presented in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] fulfills all these conditions .",
    "the last condition is guaranteed by spanning our structure on the triangular lattice . actually , this structure is topologically equivalent to the archimedean lattice @xmath0 .",
    "patterns of all eleven archimedean lattices can be found in ref . .",
    "topological equivalence means that one lattice can be stretched into the other .",
    "magnetism of archimedean lattices has been investigated for some years.@xcite however , these works deal with the isotropic heisenberg interaction .",
    "we are not aware about temperature - dependent simulations on the @xmath0 lattice with ising antiferromagnetism .",
    "the energy of the classical ising state@xcite in the presence of external magnetic field @xmath2 is @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the antiferromagnetic exchange constant and the first summation goes over all nearest neighbor pairs @xmath6 .",
    "the degeneracy of the ground state energy ( gse ) of the structure presented in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] , termed as stretched archimedean for brevity from now on , can be demonstrated easily when we look at the unit cell in fig .",
    "there are nine bonds in the unit cell",
    ". the ground state energy can not be smaller than it is allowed by the frustration , which is unavoidable within the two triangles .",
    "the contribution from the triangles to gse is then @xmath7 per unit cell . provided that the spins connected with other bonds are oriented in antiparallel",
    ", we get @xmath8 per unit cell for field equal to zero .",
    "this is well possible , and some the ground states are periodic .",
    "one of such states is @xmath9 .",
    "another periodic ground state can be obtained by a simultaneous flip of spins @xmath10 in each unit cell .",
    "more general , we have six periodic ground states @xmath11 ; additional condition is that @xmath12 .",
    "these states are collected in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] .",
    ".list of homogeneous ground states , with spins labeled as in fig .",
    "[ cell ] . in last column ,",
    "paths are indicated which lead to other states by flipping pairs of spins in all unit cells . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     obviously , many other non - periodic ground states of the whole lattice can be obtained , for example from @xmath13 if the flip of two spins is performed only in a selected number of unit cells .",
    "this means that the ground state degeneracy increases with the lattice size at least as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of sites .",
    "we apply the heat bath monte carlo approach@xcite to find the magnetic contribution to the specific heat at zero field , i.e.    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is an average over thermodynamic ensemble , and @xmath18 . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "the thermal average @xmath17 is substituted by the time average .",
    "a lattice of @xmath19 spins is used , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the initial state is of full saturation , i.e. all spins equal to @xmath20 .",
    "alternatively spins are randomly + 1 or @xmath21 , with equal weights . after about @xmath22 time steps , the total magnetization is close to zero , and the system is reasonably close to thermal equilibrium , at least for high temperatures .",
    "we define a time step as one update of the whole network .",
    "then , the time average of @xmath23 and @xmath24 is found .",
    "the results are averaged over @xmath25 trials . for @xmath26 less than @xmath27 $ ] the statistics",
    "is better : @xmath28 .",
    "the obtained plot is shown in fig .",
    "[ cv ] .",
    "the same algorithm is used to calculate the static susceptibility for zero field , i.e.    @xmath29    where @xmath30 . here",
    "again , two sets of data @xmath31 are obtained for two different kinds of the initial conditions , one saturated and one random .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "as we see , two curves @xmath31 become different below certain temperature .",
    "the curve for the random initial state is higher .",
    "this is so since , for low temperature , the algorithm of heat bath leads the saturated system to one of its ground states , whereas the randomness of initial state is to some extent preserved .    to get more insight into this memory effect , we also calculate the thermal dependence of the edward ",
    "anderson order parameter @xmath32.@xcite in its definition below , the appropriate time average is written explicitly : @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ qea ] we show @xmath34 obtained from a random and saturated states by the heat bath algorithm at zero temperature . as we see , @xmath32 starts to differ from zero at temperature close to @xmath35 $ ] , where the plots on @xmath36 and @xmath31 obtained for different initial conditions separate .",
    "for the case of @xmath37 , we calculate also the spectrum of the metastable states .",
    "these states are obtained from a random initial state by means of the heat bath algorithm in zero temperature limit .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",

    "the curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ loops ] . for a comparison ,",
    "we present also the data obtained for the square lattice and the triangular lattice .",
    "the distribution of sizes of spin flips avalanches is shown in fig .",
    "[ peaks ] . by an avalanche size we mean the number of flipped spins at a given field . in fig . [ peaks ] , we see three maxima , obtained at fields @xmath40 , @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] . the avalanches at @xmath40 are just numbers of spins which flip when the system passes from random initial state to a metastable state , with final energy distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ hist_e](a ) .",
    "these avalanches are the largest , as they contain about 23000 flippings .",
    "the avalanches occurring at field @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] contain 10450 and 19800 flippings in the average ( see fig .",
    "[ peaks](a ) ) .    above",
    "@xmath44 $ ] , all spins are saturated .",
    "provided that , in the average , the magnetization of a metastable state is approximately zero , a half of spins ( @xmath45 ) are to be flipped to saturate the sample . in fig .",
    "[ peaks](b - d ) we show the same peaks in smaller scales , what enables to observe their detailed character .",
    "the positions of the peaks of the spectrum indicate , that the summarized size of avalanches at @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] is 30250 in the average .",
    "the small amount of difference , here 250 spins in the average , mean that some spins flip back and forth .    , the square lattice and the triangular lattice ( solid , dashed and dotted lines , respectively ) for @xmath37 . ]",
    "\\(a )   ( b )   + ( c )   ( d )",
    "the magnetic properties of the investigated lattice shows similarities to the spin glass state .",
    "these are : maxima of the spin susceptibility @xmath46 and the specific heat @xmath47 as dependent on temperature , and the memory effect , i.e. the dependence of these observables on an initial state below @xmath48 $ ] . in this range of @xmath26 , the edwards ",
    "anderson order parameter @xmath32 is different from zero .",
    "we deduce that there , the ensemble average can not be substituted by the time average , and our numerical results on @xmath47 and @xmath46 are not reliable . however , the main peaks of @xmath47 and @xmath46 between @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 $ ] do not depend on the initial state .    on the other hand , the ground state energy is multiply degenerated . as a consequence , the overlap@xcite of two ground states @xmath51 and @xmath52 , defined as @xmath53 is different from unity .",
    "for example , the overlap between states a and b from tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] is @xmath54 .",
    "when the non - periodic ground states are taken into account , the overlap distribution @xmath55 is practically a continuous function of @xmath56 . to explain it ,",
    "let us consider only two periodic ground states , a and b. if only those two are possible , an overlap between two non periodic ground states @xmath51 and @xmath52 within a unit cell is either @xmath57 or @xmath58 , for the cells in the same or different states , respectively .",
    "for any state @xmath51 , we can select @xmath59 out of @xmath60 unit cells and form state @xmath52 putting them in the same states , as in @xmath51 . in this case",
    "we have the overlap probability @xmath61    in fact , there are six periodic ground states , and not only two .",
    "information , cells in which ground states can be neighbors without raising energy , is given in the last column of tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] . if the condition of periodicity is removed , the number of ground states of a unit cell increases . in any case",
    ", a typical ground state of the whole lattice is expected to be not periodic , but disordered .",
    "in this way , the most simple definition of spin glass@xcite is true for our lattice . in the case of @xmath37 ,",
    "the system dynamics leads to ( meta)stable states , which depend on initial states .",
    "the spectrum of gse and the magnetization curve reveal a random character , which is a consequence of the random initial state .",
    "numerical results reported above suggest , that the temperature of the transition between the paramagnetic state and the low - temperature state , which seems to be the spin - glass state , is positive .",
    "it is an open question , how much disorder is needed to reproduce the vanishing of the transition temperature , which is the standard result for two - dimensional ising spin glasses.@xcite with small amount of disorder , we expect that the interaction field at some sites is zero and these spins flip freely .",
    "once a cluster of these spins spans throughout the lattice , the transition at finite temperatures is likely to disappear .    concluding",
    ", the @xmath0 archimedean lattice can be useful as a reference example when the question , which features of a realistic spin glass are a consequence of frustration only , is under debate .",
    "this structure can be also a good starting point for numerical calculations .",
    "last but not least , it is much easier to simulate an ising spin glass where the magnetic interaction is homogeneous .",
