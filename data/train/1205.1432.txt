    "<S> events like inflation or phase transitions can produce large density perturbations on very small scales in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> probes of small scales are therefore useful for e.g. discriminating between inflationary models . until recently , the only such constraint came from non - observation of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) , associated with the largest perturbations . </S>",

    "<S> recent work @xcite has shown that moderate - amplitude density perturbations produced in the early universe can collapse to form ultra - dense halos of dark matter ( dm ) , known as ultracompact minihalos ( ucmhs ) . </S>",
    "<S> it was quickly realised @xcite that such compact objects present an excellent target for indirect searches for self - annihilating dm , as they exhibit extremely steep inner radial density profiles ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this profile comes about because ucmhs collapse very shortly after matter - radiation equality , and therefore form essentially in isolation , by almost pure radial infall @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in a longer paper @xcite , we investigated the abundance of ucmhs allowed in and around our galaxy by gamma - ray and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations , in order to determine implications for the allowed amplitude of cosmological perturbations in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> we summarise those findings here ; the reader is referred to the longer paper for full details of all calculations . </S>",
    "<S> all calculations shown in these proceedings assume that ucmhs collapse at @xmath1 , a dm mass of 1tev , and 100% annihilation into @xmath2 pairs with the standard thermal cross - section ( @xmath3@xmath4s@xmath5 ) ; we note , however , that the dependence of these limits on the properties of the annihilating particles is actually rather weak .    in the left panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] , we show the allowed fraction of dm that might be in ucmhs , as given by three different gamma - ray observations by the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) : searches for individual ( point and extended ) dm sources within our own galaxy , searches for similar sources outside the galaxy , and the total gamma - ray diffuse flux . here </S>",
    "<S> we base our limits on the non - observation of any dm sources by _ fermi _ , and the demand that the diffuse flux from ucmhs not exceed the total diffuse gamma - ray flux observed by _ </S>",
    "<S> fermi _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . at very large scales , </S>",
    "<S> the strongest limits come from the extragalactic search , at moderate scales from the galactic source search , and at the smallest scales , the best limits are provided by the diffuse flux measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we translate these limits into limits on the spectral index of primordial perturbations @xmath6 ( right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] ) , in the scenario where perturbations follow a simple unbroken power law ( as might e.g. be expected from the simplest inflationary models ) . </S>",
    "<S> the best limit on @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is rather tight , given that ucmhs probe scales many orders of magnitude below those accessible to the cmb . for comparison , for primordial black holes ( pbhs ) this limit </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath8 @xcite ) . in this panel </S>",
    "<S> ( and the following ones ) , we also give limits derived from the impact of ucmhs on reionisation , and the resulting change of the integrated cmb optical depth due to electron scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reionisation limits provide support to those from gamma - rays , but are significantly weaker in general .    in the left panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , we instead consider models where the spectrum follows a power law but has a step at some characteristic scale @xmath9 ( left panel ) , constraining the height @xmath10 of this step to be less than a factor of about 11 in the spectral amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> in the right - hand panel of fig .  [ fig:2 ] , we give limits on the raw power spectrum of curvature perturbations , using a generalised , non - parametric form for the spectrum of primordial perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the final limits are compared with earlier limits from ucmhs @xcite in this panel , and with all other limits or measurements of the primordial power spectrum in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] it is clear that ucmhs provide an extremely valuable limit on the size of cosmological perturbations at scales between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , well below any scale probed by the cmb .    the new limits we present here on the primordial power spectrum are up to 5 orders of magnitude better than the previous best limits for these scales , provided by pbhs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further improvements are expected to come from improved gamma - ray observations , and more sensitive microlensing searches for ucmhs ( e.g.  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter will be especially important , as unlike gamma - ray limits , microlensing does not rely on the assumption that dm can self - annihilate .    </S>",
