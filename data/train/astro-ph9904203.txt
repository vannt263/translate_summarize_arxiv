    "observed profiles of different emission lines often show intriguing differences in width and relative velocity . in some objects , there is a rather strong correlation between line width and critical density or ionization potential ( de robertis &  osterbrock 1986 ) .",
    "these trends have led to the concept of a density gradient across the line emitting regions , with the higher critical density ( or higher ionization ) lines being emitted closer to the continuum source .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the velocity dispersion decreases with increasing distance from the source of ionizing photons , as expected for gas whose motion is predominantly rotational or virialized .",
    "variations in line width complicate attempts to separate the broad ( blr ) and narrow ( nlr ) line contributions in a source .",
    "the frequent observation of a prominent component with fwhm@xmath2 1600 km s@xmath3 in the  ( hereafter civ ) profile complicates the interpretation of high ionization line ( hil ) properties in particular . in an attempt to take into account the diverse widths of emission lines ,",
    "some workers have proposed the existence of an  intermediate line region  ( ilr ) ( see e.g. wills et al .",
    "this emission component has been routinely treated as part of the blr emission in line profile studies either : a ) because it is believed to be part of the non - nlr gas or b ) because a clear inflection between the emitting components is not often seen in the civ profile making it difficult to subtract ( see e.g. baldwin 1997 , p. 92 ) .    in section 2",
    "we discuss three observational results : 1 ) an unambiguous civ nlr component with fwhm similar to [ oiii]@xmath05007 is seen in many seyfert 2 galaxies , 2 ) a similar component is also identified in some broad line agn ( with and without an inflection ) although the component is often broader with mean fwhm@xmath2 900 km s@xmath3 broader than fwhm h@xmath4 ( @xmath5 fwhm [ oiii]@xmath05007 ) and 3 ) except for the broader profile width the `` narrower '' civ component shows properties very similar to those ascribed to the classical nlr .",
    "section 3 presents model calculations to show that the diversity of narrow line profile widths can be ascribed to a smooth gradient of physical properties in the nlr , and that a larger width , @xmath2 10002000 , is expected for civ without invoking a new ( ilr ) emitting region .",
    "finally , in section 4 we argue : a ) that introduction of a new emitting region is unjustified and b ) that blr properties inferred from the civ line are strongly dependent on whether or not a narrow component is subtracted .",
    "most of the uv spectroscopic data for seyfert 2 sources comes from the iue archive .",
    "while the resolution of this data is limited , it shows that the majority of seyfert 2 galaxies exhibit a narrow line component of civ .",
    "we assume , following unification ideas , that blr civ and  are obscured in seyfert 2 s and that we see only nlr emission , the same nlr in seyfert 1 and 2 sources . study of averaged spectra for a sample of twenty mostly `` pure '' seyfert 2 sources ( heckmann et al .",
    "1995 ) show a significant narrow civ line .",
    "detailed study of iue spectra for ngc 7674 and i zw 92 ( kraemer et al .",
    "1994 ) show an nlr line intensity ratio civ/@xmath5 2.0 .",
    "ngc 1068 and 5643 are the only seyfert 2 sources in the hst archive with high s / n fos spectra of the civ region .",
    "ngc 1068 is the brightest example of a seyfert 2 with a confirmed hidden blr ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) .",
    "recent study of the fos spectra for ngc 1068 ( kraemer , ruiz &  crenshaw 1998 ) show that it contains a strong   nlr component ( partially resolved into @xmath61548/1551 components ) with fwhm@xmath5 1100 @xmath7 200  .",
    "the narrow component of h@xmath4 , and show profile fwhm @xmath5 1000 @xmath7 200 ( caganoff et al .",
    "clear evidence for nlr civ ( fwhm=1180 ) is also seen in a bright seyfert 1.5 galaxy , ngc 5548 ( goad &  koratkar 1998 ) .",
    "the nlr component in ngc 5548 remained constant while the blr component went through large changes , reenforcing the idea that independent nlr and blr components exist in that source .",
    "the above cited observations make it clear that nlr civ exists in many lower luminosity agn .",
    "it is unambiguous in seyfert 2 sources but can be very confusing in sources that show blr emission because a clear nlr / blr profile inflection is only occasionally observed .",
    "it has been argued ( wills et al .",
    "1993 ) that higher luminosity sources do not show an nlr component .",
    "this argument arose from profile analysis of a small sample of high luminosity radio loud sources ( wills et al .",
    "the nlr was concluded to be weak or absent in these sources because no significant profile component that matched the width of [ oiii]@xmath05007 was found .",
    "this interpretation was widely accepted , in part , because reddening was assumed to be high in the nlr ( e(b - v)@xmath20.5 ) .",
    "the above cited data suggests : 1 ) that the reddening is frequently not so high ( kraemer , ruiz & crenshaw 1998 derive a nuclear reddening of only e(b - v ) = 0.02 for ngc1068 ) and/or 2 ) that civ is amplified by some physical process ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the current interpretation of narrow line spectra in ngc 1068 and 5548 points toward relatively high density and ionization parameter at the inner edge of the nlr",
    ". a value of @xmath8 accounts for the strength of several high ionization lines ( kraemer et al .",
    "the dereddened nlr intensity ratio /h@xmath4 is @xmath5 14 for ngc 5548 , and an inner nlr component with /h@xmath4@xmath5 30 appears to be necessary .",
    "recently , ferguson et al . (",
    "1997 ) interpreted the strength of the strongest coronal lines observed in the spectra of seyfert galaxies in terms of emission from photoionized gas in a rather dense region which could also be associated with the innermost nlr .    our own line profile survey ( marziani et al .",
    "1996 : ms ) of a heterogeneous sample of 52 agn found examples of both high and low luminosity sources with a narrow civ component comparable in width to [ oiii]@xmath05007 .",
    "however a considerable number of sources showed a narrow component of civ ( and [ oiii]@xmath04363 , when it could be resolved from h@xmath9 ) that was broader than [ oiii]@xmath05007 by as much as 1500 km s@xmath3 .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the distributions of broad and narrow line widths found for civ and h@xmath4 in the ms survey .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that both civ nlr and blr are broader than the corresponding regions in h@xmath4 .",
    "additional support for our nlr interpretation of the narrower civ component comes from observations of sources where the nlr is resolved . in the case of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 5643",
    ", the civ nlr feature is obviously broader , even in the extended emission line region ( eelr : fwhm=1800@xmath7200 ) , than either nlr heii@xmath01640 or nlr .",
    "pg2308 + 098 is an example of a higher luminosity ( z=0.43 ) source from the ms survey that shows a clear inflection between the broad and , one of the broadest observed , narrow civ components .",
    "we derived a fwhm @xmath5 2630  for the narrow civ component considerably broader than fwhm @xmath5 700@xmath7100  measured for  and  in that source .",
    "figure 2 shows a comparison between the civ feature in the ngc 5643 eelr and the narrow civ component derived for pg 2308 + 098 .",
    "figure 2 clearly shows that the width of the two narrow features are equal within the observational errors .",
    "narrow component widths as broad as the one observed in pg2308 + 098 are clearly not unprecedented in unambiguous nlr emitting regions .",
    "we calculated photoionization models of the nlr and computed the emergent spectrum using cloudy ( ferland 1996 ) .",
    "our goal was to account for fwhm differences as large as @xmath10 ( mean difference @xmath11v= 900 km s @xmath3 ) between  and civ .",
    "we did not attempt sophisticated model innovations nor did we try to fit the line profiles of a particular source .",
    "we attempted instead to illustrate the implications of recent robust results involving the input to photoionization calculations for the  and  line profiles when the nlr line emission is not spatially resolved ( presently the case for the vast majority of agn ) . at z @xmath5 0.2 , a 0.25 aperture ( typically employed for fos observations ) covers 1 kpc of spatial extent : thus most of the nlr should be included in a measurement .",
    "input parameters for our models are listed in table 1 .",
    "we assumed spherical symmetry with a radial density gradient described by a power - law , @xmath12 3  from 1 - 10@xmath13 pc .",
    "the density at the outer edge of the nlr was set equal to @xmath14 3  in all cases .",
    "we assumed a power - law dependence for the covering factor , i. e. @xmath15 , with total nlr covering factor 0.1 .",
    "the first three models listed in table 1 follow netzer ( 1990 ) with a column density @xmath16 .",
    "the last four models assumed that @xmath17 @xmath18 = constant throughout the nlr ( column 3 lists adopted values of m ) .",
    "the inclusion of the effects of appreciable mechanical heating appear to be necessary for realistic modeling of the nlr .",
    "hst narrow - band images and radio maps have show a close relationship between radio ejecta and nlr emitting plasma in several nearby seyfert galaxies ( capetti et al .",
    "1999 ; falcke et al .",
    "a crude estimate of the heating rate @xmath19  can be obtained by assuming that a fraction @xmath20@xmath21 ( approximately equal to the covering factor @xmath22 ) of the jet energy flux @xmath23  is converted into heating of the nlr gas .",
    "assuming an exponential radial dependence of the heating rate we can write @xmath24  3 , where we have parameterized the dependence on outer radius ( r@xmath25 ) , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ( column 4 lists the scale factor ) . the values @xmath26 and 10pc correspond , respectively , to a heating rate per unit volume at 1 pc @xmath27 ( which is neglible ) and @xmath28 ( which provides significant enhancement of electron temperature , in a cocoon within 2 pc ) .",
    "the latter cases is also more realistic because recent hydrodynamic simulations show that most of the line luminosity is concentrated in dense clouds surrounding the jet ( steffen et al .",
    "however , recent observations ( villar - martin et al . 1999 ) of high redshift radio - loud and quiet sources reveal fwhm@xmath29 1000 emission lines in extended gas both near and far from radio jets .",
    "the jet energy flux is a poorly known quantity , and its actual relevance depends on the details of the jet / cloud interaction .",
    "significant heating of clouds can however be expected for a wide range of agn including radio quiet objects like seyferts ( in agreement with the analysis of bicknell et al .",
    "1998 for seyfert 2 galaxies ) .",
    "the gas is assumed to move with velocity @xmath30  i.e. , at the local virial velocity plus a component due to galactic rotation .",
    "a velocity dispersion @xmath31  is expected at a distance r equal to 1 pc ( which we assume as the inner edge of the nlr ; 1 pc @xmath5 10@xmath32 gravitational radii for a @xmath33  black hole ) , if the gas motion is rotational or virial .",
    "we focus our profile predictions on four nlr lines : civ , , , and 76087 .",
    "the widths reported in table 1 ( cols .",
    "58 ) are the weighted average of velocity over line emissivity per unit area @xmath34 ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) .",
    "observed nlr linewidth for , h@xmath4 , and 76087  are reproduced by the models ( fwhm ( ) @xmath5 fwhm(h@xmath4 ) @xmath36 fwhm(76087 ) @xmath2 1000 ) , with models 5 and 7 a slightly larger with of  with respect to , as it is often observed .",
    "the most relevant result is that @xmath37   for  appears to be significantly larger than that of any other line considered , with @xmath38@xmath39 1000  in all cases .",
    "emission is favored by ( a ) the larger ionization parameter in the innermost nlr , and ( b ) mechanical heating .",
    "a more realistic case might involve cylindrical symmetry , for example , a cylindrical nlr volume with radius 1 kpc and total height 3.4 kpc ( the values appropriate for mark 50 ; falcke et al .",
    "1998 ) , where the axis of symmetry corresponds to the radio axis .",
    "no substantial difference from the spherically symmetric models is expected as far as @xmath37  is concerned , if similar assumptions about gas motions are made",
    ". however , the cylindrical symmetry case may give : ( a ) a larger  flux with respect to the spherically symmetric case and ( b ) a possibly broader  due to the pressure exerted by the jet , which could accelerate dense gas clumps .",
    "mechanical heating may also provide a suitable mechanism for dust destruction .",
    "more sophisticated modelling ( e. g. steffen et al . 1997 ; bicknell et al .",
    "1998 ) is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "introduction of an additional ( e.g. ilr ) emitting region can be justified by the following ( not mutually exclusive ) circumstances : 1 ) spatial segregation ( e.g. region associated with a jet ) and/or 2 ) an abrupt discontinuity in physical properties ( e.g. optical thickness or cloud instability at some distance ) .",
    "this is the physical statement of occam s razor ( _ multiplicanda non sunt prter necessitatem _ ) .",
    "the above circumstances describe the justification for the concept of distinct blr and nlr regions where suppression of collisional lines yield different spectra",
    ". however `` ilr '' emission and coronal lines ( @xmath40 ) can be produced in the inner part of the nlr which , even if associated with an inner sheet adjacent to radio plasma , does not require introduction of a new distinct and discontinuous emitting region .    part of the confusion over the identification of different line emitting components may have arisen from a difference in nomenclature .",
    "wills et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and brotherton et al .",
    "( 1994a , b ) refer to the broader and narrower civ components as very broad line ( vblr ) and intermediate line ( ilr ) respectively .",
    "however they also inferred ( brotherton et al .",
    "1994b ) that the ilr properties ( reverberation distance from continuum source , density , covering factor ) are all similar to the standard nlr values . the ilr may be an `` inner part of the nlr '' but it is nlr and not blr gas .",
    "our models strengthen this view .",
    "the vblr designation is also confusing because this name has already been applied to an even broader component sometimes seen in the heii@xmath04686 feature ( ferland et al .",
    "1990 ; marziani &  sulentic 1993 ) .",
    "the model calculations support our two - component nlr - blr interpretation of the civ and  profiles . of course",
    "greater broad line profile complexity is sometimes observed , with double - peaked balmer line profiles an extreme example .",
    "the relative strength and frequency of occurence of multiple blr components is not yet well established .",
    "however one interprets the narrower civ feature , there is no justification for treating it as blr gas .",
    "a number of recent studies involving the civ blr have analysed profile data without the benefit of subtracting any nlr component ( e.g. wills et al . 1993 ; brotherton et al . 1994ab ; corbin & francis 1994 ; corbin & boroson 1996 )",
    ".    does it matter if an nlr component is subtracted from civ ?",
    "our results suggest that the answer is a strong `` yes '' .",
    "the nlr component subtracted from civ ( in ms ) represented 2 - 20% of the total flux in most cases .",
    "this flux was concentrated in the narrow peak of the line and therefore affected disproportionately determinations of the half maximum level of the broad line profile .",
    "the result of nonsubtraction yields line parameters surprisingly different from those obtained by ms .",
    "figure 3 shows a comparison of civ centroid line shifts ( relative to [ oiii]5007 ) for sources in common between ms and corbin & boroson ( 1996 ) .",
    "a similar comparison also reveals that the civ blr profile width ( fwhm ) is measured , on average , 40%  smaller when an nlr component is not subtracted .",
    "high ionization line blr properties inferred from civ , arguably the least confused hil line , are dependent on whether or not an nlr is subtracted .",
    "if an nlr component is subtracted , ms survey results suggest that : 1 ) radio - loud ( rl ) agn show fundamentally different blr geometry / kinematics from the radio quiet ( rq ) majority , 2 ) in rq ",
    "blr civ is blueshifted ( up to 3000 km s@xmath3 ) with respect to the local rest frame while h@xmath4 show small red and blue velocity shifts ( up to 600 km s@xmath3 ) about that frame and 3 ) in rl ",
    "blr civ shows zero , or small red and blue ( up to 1000 km s@xmath3 ) , velocity excursions relative to the rest frame while h@xmath4 shows larger predominantly red ( but sometimes blue ) shifts ( up to 3000 km s@xmath3 ) relative to that frame .",
    "these effects must be tested with samples that cover a larger source luminosity range .",
