    "the antiferromagnetic phases have the most isotropic @xmath37 ratio , while the nm structure is the most anisotropic .",
    "our non - magnetic plasma frequencies are in agreement with previous calculations@xcite .",
    "magnetic plasma frequencies in the str .",
    "phase have been reported before in two recent works@xcite and we find a reasonable agreement with our results .",
    "slightly smaller and more isotropic values are reported in the past perhaps because of the larger value of the fe moment ( 1.64 @xmath28 and 1.98 @xmath28 ) .",
    "the experimental in - plane plasma frequency , extracted from optical conductivity measurements , has been estimated in ref . to be @xmath38 ev at room temperature and 0.58 at 10 k.",
    "the low temperature limit is in good agreement with our estimate for the striped phase ( our zero temperature ground state ) . on the other hand , the room temperature value , measured above the nel temperature ( @xmath39 ) ,",
    "should be compared to our estimate in the non - magnetic phase ( 2.55 ev ) ; the experimental value turns out to be much smaller . a temperature effect , not included in our calculations , could partially justify this disagreement .",
    "however a strong dependence of the plasma frequency on temperature is not expected : in case of a similar system , bani@xmath2as@xmath2 , the plasma frequency drops by only 5% of its value between 300 k and 150 k ( above the structural / magnetic phase transition)@xcite .    for the non - magnetic phase , a disagreement between lda calculated plasma frequencies and experimental estimation from optical conductivity has been already reported , and been interpreted as an indication of correlation effects@xcite . however , assuming that the main reason for the discrepancy is correlation , our results indicate that renormalization effects are much stronger in the _ normal _ state than in the magnetic one . if we consider the ratio between the theoretical and experimental @xmath40 , as a measure of the renormalization effect induced by correlations , as was done in ref .",
    ", then quite unexpectedly we find the non - magnetic phase of bafe@xmath5as@xmath5  to be a strongly correlated material , while magnetic bafe@xmath5as@xmath5  appears to be a conventional one .",
    "there has been disagreement in the literature on whether this implies that the dynamical spin correlation effects present in the metallic phase are frozen out in the magnetic one , or that the effect can not be ascribed to correlation effects at all , but is simply due to the inadequacy of the lsda exchange - correlation functional ( as suggested by mazin in ref . ) .",
    "the veracity of either of these scenarios can not be determined by the present calculations      calculated optical conductivity for the non - magnetic phase is shown in the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmap ] .",
    "strong anisotropy between the in - plane ( @xmath41 ) and out of plane ( @xmath42 ) conductivity is immediately apparent . in particular",
    ", the out - of - plane conductivity has a more pronounced frequency dependence than its in - plane counterpart .",
    "this anisotropy underscored by the appearance of a plasmonic peak , present only in @xmath43 . at this point it is worth noting that the value of the plasma frequency in the out - of - plane case is much smaller than in conventional metals , the reason for this lies in the low value of the fermi velocity in the @xmath25 direction .",
    "the origin of optical conductivity in the nm phase can be determined by looking at the joint density of states ( jdos ) , which is the real part of the optical conductivity with equal weight for all optical transitions ( momentum matrix elements set to 1 ) .",
    "this jdos can be further resolved into various orbital contributions as follows : @xmath44 where @xmath45 are band indices and @xmath46 is the projection of the kohn - sham state on the orbital channel @xmath47 .",
    "this orbital projected jdos is shown in the lowest panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmap ] . clearly , all the low energy features originate from the fe @xmath48-states that dominate near the fermi energy .    the optical conductivity in various magnetic phases is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_m ] .",
    "the main effect of magnetism is an increase of conductivity in the 0.1 - 1.0 ev range .",
    "the reason for this is that the reduced symmetry makes more states available ( folding of the brillouin zone due to the antiferromagnetic symmetry breaking ) , and new interband transitions are allowed in the low energy range . as we will see in the following , the new structures merge in the drude intraband contribution , as soon as the magnetic order disappears .",
    "this is anticipated by the behavior of @xmath9 in the ferromagnetic phase , where the ordered moment is low . in this phase a broad shoulder at about 0.1 ev is almost merged with the drude peak ( two dotted lines corresponding to the @xmath26 and @xmath49 channels ) .",
    "this enhancement of @xmath50 in the 0.1 - 0.3 ev region , induced by af ordering , is an important feature of our results .",
    "this has been observed experimentally by different groups .",
    "we identify the peak at 1000 @xmath51 ( 0.124 mev ) reported in refs . as a result of the af ordering which introduces additional low frequency transitions .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in the striped phase it appears only for field polarization perpendicular to the stripes ( let s call it _ off - stripe _ ) .",
    "no similar effect exists when the electric field is in the direction of the stripes where the magnetic ordering is ferromagnetic .    in order to understand this we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] the energy bands dispersion along the main lines of the brillouin zone , including the two orthogonal in - plane directions both in the top and basal planes .",
    "compared to the usual representation of bands in this compound , we have here a folding of the brillouin zone , with the @xmath21 point electron pockets folded back at @xmath52 .",
    "we highlight in particular a fe @xmath53band located at about @xmath54 ev at @xmath52 , strongly dispersed in the direction of the stripe ( @xmath55 ) and flat in the off - stripe direction .",
    "the presence of this band offers a much larger phase - space availability for vertical transitions , compared to the non - magnetic case and to the orthogonal direction .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then the experimental peak can be fully understood in terms of single particle properties .    at higher energies , around 8 ev",
    ", a peak mostly due to ba @xmath56-states appears in the imaginary part of @xmath9 , inducing a corresponding structure at about 6 ev in its real part .",
    "these high energy features are not affected by the magnetic ordering , which induces important major changes only up to about 3 ev .",
    "the effect of magnetic ordering can be singled out by defining the conductivity anisotropy @xmath57 , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltasigma ] .",
    "this anisotropy is strongly dependent on the magnetic moment , which in turn is strongly overestimated by standard dft - lda . in order to partially account for this effect ,",
    "we perform fixed - spin - moment dft calculations and report @xmath58 as a function of the fe magnetic moment varying from 1.5 @xmath59 ( the value obtained in our ground state calculations ) to zero .",
    "we see that for the calculated ground state , the low frequency part of the spectrum has an anisotropy peak centered around 0.25 ev ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the spectral weight of this peak is compensated by depletion regions at high energy ( see for example the negative peak around 1.5 ev ) . for smaller values of the magnetic moment",
    "this peak grows in intensity and also shifts toward lower frequencies .",
    "according to the above interpretation of the peak of @xmath9 , this can be understood in terms of the creation of a quasi - gap ( depletion in the density of states ) around the fermi level @xmath35 : a smaller moment implies a smaller quasi - gap , with a more peaked shape anisotropic structure .",
    "the same happens to the high energy negative structures .",
    "our theoretical spectrum and its anisotropy can be compared with the experimental results@xcite .",
    "the presence of anisotropy peak , _ magnetic in origin _ , is confirmed by experiment , both in its energy position and in its general shape , with a depletion of states around and above 500 mev ( 4000 @xmath61 ) . to have a consistent comparison",
    ", we should consider our values calculated at the experimental magnetic moment .",
    "this is not easy as there is no universal agreement between different experiments : neutron diffraction and mssbauer measurements give moments around 1 and 0.4 @xmath59 respectively@xcite . in light of this",
    ", our comparison can only be semi - quantitative .",
    "still , using the results for @xmath62 , the peak at 1000 - 2000 @xmath61 ( 120 - 250 mev ) and the depletion of states after 3000 - 4000 @xmath61 ( 350 - 500 mev ) found in experiments are in fact well reproduced by theory .",
    "we also notice that in experiments the peak position does not change with temperature , while in our case it does change with the magnitude of the fixed moment .",
    "while the latter finding is clearly a consequence of the evolution of the band structure , the experimental behavior seems to point to a disorder of atomic moments , rather than to their reduced magnitude .",
    "bearing this in mind , we can make a detailed comparison between our results and experiments based on the anisotropy in the optical conductivity recently observed on detwinned crystals@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] we plot the experimental anisotropy together with theoretical results ( drude contributions are not included in both curves ) .",
    "we clearly see a fairly good agreement in the general shape .",
    "the main interband peak starts with a slightly broad shoulder at lower energy in experiments than the theoretical calculations .",
    "most importantly , by comparing the @xmath31 and @xmath32 components of @xmath9 we see very similar features in the magnetically induced anisotropy .",
    "the peak is found at higher energy in our theoretical results ; however , as seen in the previous discussion ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : deltasigma ] ) , this peak moves to lower energies as the fe magnetic moment reduces .",
    "if we force the magnetic moment to be close to the experimental value ( see lower panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : comparison ] ) the comparison improves significantly , with a very good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "a fuller understanding of the optical properties of this system can be achieved by studying the doped system .",
    "it is well established experimentally that electron or hole doping of the bafe@xmath5as@xmath5 , rapidly destabilizes the magnetic phase . in the case of ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as  at 6%",
    "co concentration magnetism disappears and the compound becomes a superconductor .",
    "a possible coexistence between the two phases has been reported@xcite , possibly justified by nano - scale inhomogeneity in the dopants . in this work",
    "we assume that the magnetic phase is destroyed at 6% of homogeneous co doping , and that below this doping concentration superconductivity is absent .    keeping the crystal structure fixed , and using the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) ,",
    "this phase transition is not properly reproduced by dft lsda calculations@xcite .",
    "the fe moment seems to be only weakly reduced by electron doping ( by about 20% for x=0.06 ) .",
    "the strong sensitivity of magnetism to the as positions and the unavoidable impossibility of describing disorder effects could be all valid reasons for this disagreement with experiments .",
    "this disagreement could again be due to correlation effects beyond lsda .",
    "we can simulate the experimental situation ( and in particular the co induced destabilization of magnetism ) by doing fixed spin moment calculations , as before . at each doping ( achieved using vca ) we fix the magnetic moment by scaling it according to the experimental magnetic critical temperature @xmath39@xcite .",
    "this constraint is likely to correct the deficiency of the conventional lsda calculation and will mimic the two main co induced effects : a localized electron doping on the fe layer , and a magnetic to non - magnetic phase transition induced by this .    the calculated optical conductivity in the str .",
    "phase is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : co_doping ] .",
    "when doping reduces the fe magnetic moment the system becomes more metallic  an increase of the plasma frequency is accompanied by a large transfer of spectral weight from the structures around 0.8 ev to the drude peak .",
    "the region of suppressed conductivity around 70 mev , is filled as the magnetic gap closes .",
    "the observed trend is similar to the one reported in experiments ( see for example the work of nakajima _ et al . _ and lucarelli _ et al . _ ) .",
    "the main difference between our calculations and the experimental work ( see for example fig . [ 4 ] on ref . ) , is in the evolution of the spectra : we observe a transfer of spectral weight from one peak in the high energy part of the spectrum to the drude component , while in experiments the spectral weight transfers smoothly , without spectral peaks moving sharply as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "we believe that this difference can be also understood in terms of the intrinsic inhomogeneity of the doping in samples , present even in a macroscopically homogeneous co distribution .",
    "experimental indications of this kind of inhomogeneity have been reported and discussed in several papers@xcite .",
    "therefore , experimentally each spectrum would correspond , to some extent , to an average of a range of theoretical dopings , that are intrinsically homogeneous in the virtual crystal approximation .",
    "in this work we report the calculated optical conductivity for bafe@xmath5as@xmath5 , one of the most studied members of the iron arsenide family in order to understand which experimental features can be reproduced by theoretical methods based on dft .",
    "we confirm the fact that the plasma frequency in the non - magnetic phase is much higher than the experimentally observed values , indicating a poor description of the non - magnetic state within lsda . on the other hand , in the magnetic striped phase the experimental estimate of the in plane plasma frequency ( 0.58 ev )",
    "is not far from our values ( 0.7 and 0.91 ev ) . if one ascribes the disagreement between theoretical and experimental results to correlation effects , as proposed by qazilbash _",
    "_ , this would mean that the virtual spin fluctuations freeze in at the onset of static magnetic ordering .",
    "studying the frequency dependence of the optical conductivity , we observe that a low energy peak appears whenever the polarization of the incident light is directed along an antiferromagnetically oriented spin configuration , as in the cb or str .",
    "phase along the @xmath34 direction .",
    "this magnetic peak has been observed experimentally by various groups . in this work",
    "we are able to explain the experimentally observed large anisotropy of this peak@xcite .",
    "we also reported the effect of co doping , by combining fixed moment calculations ( to reproduce the experimental fe moment ) and the virtual crystal approximation and were able to reproduce the spectral weight transfer of the optical conductivity from the high to the low energy parts of the spectrum , as a function of such doping .",
    "this effect can be ascribed to the reconstruction of the electronic structure around the fermi energy because of the magnetic ordering .",
