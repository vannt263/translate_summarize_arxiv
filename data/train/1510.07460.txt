    "the multipartite entangled states that are invariant under permutations are useful for the quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states , dicke states ( including @xmath1-qubit w states ) and higher dimensional w states are some notable examples in the permutationally invariant states . in this paper",
    ", we formulate the non-@xmath0-separability criteria for the @xmath1-qubit dicke states with arbitrary excitations and @xmath1-qudit w states .",
    "dicke states which were first observed from spontaneous emission of light by a cloud of atoms @xcite are the family of multiqubit entangled states which are symmetric with respect to the subsystem permutations .",
    "an @xmath1-qubit dicke state with @xmath3 excitations is defined as @xcite @xmath4 denotes the sum over all possible permutations .",
    "for example , a @xmath5-qubit dicke state with @xmath6 excitations is denoted by @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "dicke states have been generated and studied experimentally with systems like photons and ions @xcite .",
    "since dicke states are most robust against decoherence @xcite , they can be used effectively for certain tasks such as open - destination teleportation @xcite , quantum telecloning @xcite and quantum secret sharing @xcite . recently",
    ", various tools have been developed to detect genuine multipartite entanglement in dicke states and in the vicinity of dicke class of states .",
    "to name a few , we cite ( i ) fidelity - based entanglement witness operators @xcite , ( ii ) set of inequalities which involve permutation operators @xcite , ( iii ) the criteria which based on simple measurements of collective spin operators @xcite , ( iv ) entanglement witnesses using the method of ppt mixtures @xcite and ( v ) the criterion which based on the measurement of global spin @xcite .",
    "the criterion which isolates the non-@xmath0-separability in dicke class of states with single excitation was derived in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-qudit w state has several generalizations @xcite .",
    "one such generalization , namely a @xmath6-qutrit w state ( @xmath9 ) , was considered in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6-qutrit w state has been generalized to @xmath1-qudit w state @xmath10 as @xmath11 denotes the sum over all possible permutations . in this generalization",
    "each system in an @xmath1 number of system can have @xmath12 to @xmath13 excitations with a restriction that two subsystems cannnot be in the same excitation at a moment .",
    "for example , a 4-dimensional 4-partite w state is by definition @xmath14 .",
    "w class of entangled states are found applications in quantum teleportation @xcite , super dense coding , splitting quantum information @xcite and solving quantum leader election problem in networks @xcite .",
    "several conditions were proposed to detect genuine multipartite entanglement and nonseparability in w class of states @xcite .",
    "for example , huber et al . have proposed a general framework to identify genuinely multipartite entangled mixed quantum states in arbitrary dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "gabriel et al . have developed a necessary criterion for @xmath0-separable mixed multipartite states @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-nonseparability criteria for the w states and anti w states were developed in @xcite .",
    "very recently we have formulated the non-@xmath0-separability criterion for a generalized @xmath1-qudit w state @xcite .    even though attempts have been made to isolate genuine multipartite entanglement and nonseparability of these two classes of states , the necessary and/or sufficient criteria to identify the non-@xmath0-separability in dicke class of states with @xmath3 excitations and for the higher dimensional w states are yet to be formulated .",
    "motivated by this observation , in this paper , we propose a set of conditions which identify the non-@xmath0-separability in these two mixed multipartite states using elements of density matrices . with the help of our criteria",
    "one can detect the non-@xmath0-separability in dicke class of states , anti w states and mixtures thereof and @xmath1-qudit w class of states .",
    "we also illustrate the method of identifying genuine multipartite entanglement and nonseparability of @xmath1 qubit dicke state added with white noise and mixture of @xmath1-qudit w state with white noise .",
    "further we analyze the white noise tolerance of our criteria .",
    "in addition to the above , we demonstrate that the criteria presented in this paper can be experimentally implementable with the help of local expectation values of pauli operators and generalized gell - mann matrices .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we recall the definition of @xmath0-separability and give an expression to count the number of possible partitions that can exist in the @xmath0-separable @xmath1-partite states . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we present the criteria which identify the non-@xmath0-separability of dicke class of states and @xmath1-qudit w class of states .",
    "the performance of our criteria in identifying non-@xmath0-separability in the arbitrary dicke state with @xmath3 excitations added with white noise and mixture of @xmath1-qudit w state with white noise and their robustness against white noise are discussed in section [ sec4 ] . in section [ sec6 ] , we discuss the experimental feasibility of our criteria in terms of local observables .",
    "finally , in section [ sec7 ] , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the proof of one of our criteria is given in appendix .",
    "to begin , we recall the definition of @xmath0-separability . an @xmath1-partite pure quantum state @xmath15 is called @xmath0-separable @xmath16 if and only if it can be written as a product of @xmath0 substates , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , represents the state of a single subsystem or a group of subsystems @xcite .",
    "a mixed state @xmath20 is called @xmath0-separable , if it can be decomposed into pure @xmath0-separable states , that is @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23",

    "the @xmath24 s are need not be in the same partition - they may be under different partitions .",
    "in the following , we derive an expression that count the number of possible partitions that can exist in the @xmath0-separable @xmath1-partite states .",
    "let @xmath25 be the number of subsystem(s ) in each compartment of any partition belongs to the @xmath0-separable @xmath1-partite state with @xmath26 , @xmath27 . before going for a general case let us consider a specific example and count the number of different partitions it can admit .",
    "let us consider a @xmath6-separable @xmath28-partite state and count the total number of partitions in it .",
    "the possibilities in the @xmath6-separable case are ( i ) @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , ( ii ) @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and ( iii ) @xmath35 , @xmath30 , @xmath36 . in the first case ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , partitions like @xmath37 , the number of partitions can be @xmath38 , that is @xmath39 .",
    "suppose the same @xmath28-partite state is @xmath6 separable like @xmath40 ( second case ) then the number of possible partitions turn out to be @xmath41 .",
    "an extra factor @xmath42 has been introduced in the denominator since @xmath43 . since we have @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , in the present case , the number of possible partitions become @xmath44 . the third case , that is @xmath35 , @xmath30 and @xmath36 , partitions like @xmath45 , gives us @xmath46 number of partitions . considering all three possible partitions",
    "we find that the total number of partitions of the @xmath6-separable @xmath28-partite states should be @xmath47 . in a similar manner , to obtain the total number of partitions of the @xmath0-separable @xmath1-partite state we should consider all possibilities with @xmath48 and their coincidences , that is @xmath49 , @xmath50 & @xmath51 and so on , and count all of them .",
