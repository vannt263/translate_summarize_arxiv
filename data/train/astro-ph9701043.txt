    "spectra of high redshift quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) are densely populated with absorption lines blueward of the lyman alpha emission peak .",
    "this so - called `` lyman alpha forest '' is interpreted as arising from absorption by neutral hydrogen cosmologically distributed along the line - of - sight to the qso ( e.g. lynds 1971 ; sargent et al .",
    "1980 ) . for more than a decade",
    "it was not known whether the gaseous systems responsible for the lyman alpha forest were chemically pristine .",
    "meyer & york ( 1987 ) presented early evidence for metal lines in the forest , and within the last several years observations with improved spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) have revealed the presence of heavy elements in a significant fraction of lyman alpha systems with moderate hi column densities ( @xmath9 ) . analyzing data from the hires spectrograph on the keck 10  m telescope , cowie et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find that @xmath10% of identified lyman alpha lines with @xmath11 have associated civ absorption .",
    "this finding is roughly consistent with that of womble et al .",
    "( 1995 ) who infer civ absorption in 4045% of all lyman alpha systems with @xmath12 .",
    "more recently , songaila & cowie ( 1996 , hereafter sc ) presented an analysis of even higher s / n spectra and found civ absorption in @xmath13 of all systems with @xmath14 and in @xmath15 % of those with @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , they detected absorption from siiv , cii , and nv in a number of these systems .    in the present paper , we analyze the predicted metal line absorption from a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation of the high - redshift intergalactic medium , and compare these predictions to the observations of sc . the analysis of such simulations during recent years ( e.g. cen et al .",
    "1994 ; zhang et al . 1995 ; petitjean et al . 1995 ; hernquist et al .",
    "1996 ) has established a convincing general scenario in which the lyman alpha forest is produced by regions of moderate overdensity in a hierarchically clustering universe , pervaded by an ionizing radiation field presumed to originate from the qsos ( for related semi - analytic modeling see , e.g. , bi 1993 ; bi & davidsen 1996 ; hui , gnedin , & zhang 1997 ) .",
    "these cosmological lyman alpha forest models predict qso absorption features that resemble those observed , and they reproduce the column density and doppler parameter distributions down to the lowest observable column densities ( miralda - escud et al .",
    "1996 ; dav et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter dhwk ; zhang et al .",
    "the interpretation of the metal line data within the framework of these models of the lyman alpha forest constitutes a further test of the validity of the models and provides potentially valuable insight to the physical conditions prevailing in the intergalactic medium , such as gas densities , temperatures , and the shape and intensity of the ionizing radiation field .",
    "it is even conceivable that comparisons between such models and the wealth of forthcoming observations will constrain the underlying cosmological parameters , although this possibility remains to be demonstrated .",
    "haehnelt , steinmetz & rauch ( 1996 ) and rauch , haehnelt & steinmetz ( 1996 ) have pioneered the technique for incorporating metals into cosmological lyman alpha models .",
    "they endow the gas with a uniform metallicity , postulated to have arisen from a population iii burst of star formation at a significantly earlier time , and then compute the ionization states based on the assumption of a uniform ionizing background of a given strength and spectral shape . by generating and analyzing artificial metal line spectra along lines of sight through cosmological hydrodynamical simulations ,",
    "these authors compare their models to a number of observables such as the doppler parameter and column density distributions , civ / hi and other metal line ratios , and two point correlation functions , and generally find acceptable agreement between their models and observations .    in the present work we adopt a similar approach , but whereas the gaseous regions studied in the above mentioned works are overdense regions which eventually evolve into galaxies , we utilize a larger simulation which allows us to consider a random region of the universe and make quantitative predictions regarding the statistics of observable metal systems and their evolution in redshift . through most of this paper , we will assume that the simulation provides an adequate physical model of the intergalactic medium and will use the comparison to observations to obtain information about the metal enrichment of the diffuse gas and the spectral shape of the ionizing radiation field .",
    "this assumption is supported by the previous successes of the model mentioned above , and we will argue in section 4 that the success of the model in predicting the relative numbers of observable metal line systems provides further evidence favoring this physical picture of the high - redshift intergalactic medium .",
    "the cosmological simulation analyzed here is identical to that described in dhwk .",
    "a 22.222 comoving mpc box of baryonic and dark matter is evolved from @xmath17 to @xmath1 using treesph ( hernquist & katz 1989 ) , assuming a cdm spectrum of density fluctuations and the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 ) .",
    "the mass per gas and dark matter particle is @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "a spatially uniform photoionizing background radiation field is imposed , with the shape suggested by haardt & madau ( 1996 ; heareafter hm ) , and an intensity chosen to reproduce the mean hi optical depth as observed by press , rybicki & schneider ( 1993 ) . for further details regarding the simulation method ,",
    "see katz , weinberg & hernquist ( 1996 ) .",
    "artificial spectra were generated along 400 random lines of sight ( los ) through the simulation box for each of the redshifts @xmath24=2.0 , 2.33 , 2.66 , 3.0 , and 3.5 by binning the gas in distance along the los and calculating sph estimates of density , temperature , and velocity @xmath25 of the relevant species .",
    "the mass of a given species , such as civ , in each sph particle is evaluated prior to smoothing , according to @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass fraction of the metal , here carbon , in the gas , and @xmath28 is the fraction of the total carbon atoms that are found in the ionization stage civ . assuming the ionization to be in or near equilibrium",
    ", @xmath28 is a function of the local gas density @xmath29 , temperature @xmath30 , and the properties of the photoionizing background @xmath31 .",
    "we evaluate @xmath32 using the code cloudy 90 ( ferland 1996 ) , creating a lookup table in @xmath29 and @xmath30 given the adopted @xmath33 and interpolating within this table .",
    "the spatial bins are projected into their corresponding velocity bins , convolving their velocities with a thermal doppler broadening function .",
    "this procedure yields the redshift - space density profile @xmath34 along the los ; @xmath35 is the column density of a species with observed radial velocity in the interval @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "the optical depth at velocity @xmath36 is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the product of the oscillator strength and the rest transition wavelength @xmath40 for the particular absorption line ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) . the observed wavelength is @xmath41 .",
    "the resulting artificial spectra ( @xmath42 vs. @xmath36 ) are degraded to keck hires resolution ( @xmath43  ) , and noise is added with a s / n comparable to that in the hires spectrum of q1422 + 231 ( sc ) , i.e a s / n of roughly 60 in the forest region and upwards of 150 in the region redward of the lyman alpha emission peak where civ is observed .",
    "voigt profiles are fitted to the resulting artificial spectra using the automated fitter autovp ( dhwk ) to obtain the column densities and @xmath44-parameters of individual lines .",
    "given the ionizing background we have employed , we find that the observed mean metallicity as measured by [ civ / hi ] is best reproduced for a uniform metallicity of [ c / h]@xmath45",
    ". we will later vary the spectrum of the background to match observations of various metals , and when this is done we will vary [ c / h ] to match the observed mean column density of civ .",
    "we further assume [ c / fe]@xmath46 , [ si / c]@xmath47 , and [ n / c]@xmath48 .",
    "this relative abundance pattern is similar to that observed in halo stars , low metallicity hii regions , and damped lyman alpha systems ( e.g. tomkin et al .",
    "1992 ; pettini et al .",
    "1995 ; wheeler et al .",
    "1989 ) , although the nitrogen abundance is somewhat uncertain .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows an example of artificial spectra for lyman alpha ( h1216 ) , lyman beta ( h1026 ) , and civ ( @xmath50 ) absorption along one of the more spectacular los in the sample at @xmath49 , fit using autovp . at @xmath51 km / s ,",
    "a feature saturated in both lyman alpha and lyman beta is present , possessing a column density @xmath52 .",
    "the corresponding unsaturated civ lines reveal the presence of several velocity components in the system , as is often observed in high column density lyman alpha absorbers .",
    "a weaker , more typical absorption feature is seen at @xmath53 km / s . for that system , @xmath54 ,",
    "too low to be saturated in lyman beta , and @xmath55 , close to the limit of detectability .",
    "the third system , around @xmath56 km / s , has @xmath57 .",
    "this absorber also has several associated civ lines , and distinguishable individual subcomponents in lyman beta .",
    "when computing the column densities of hi and metals , we fit the lyman beta spectrum to obtain the column densities in each hi line , then we sum over all components for each species which lie within the region where the lyman beta transmission is below 0.7 .",
    "this technique is similar to that used by sc , and it avoids the ambiguous and often physically meaningless task of associating each metal line with a subcomponent in hi .",
    "the metal line absorption in systems where the lyman beta transmission does not fall below 0.7 is too weak to be detected at the sc limits .",
    "the civ / hi column density ratios for all such systems detectable in lyman alpha and civ in the 400 random los at @xmath49 are plotted as circles in figure [ fig2 ] . observed values from sc ( with @xmath58 ) are shown as solid triangles .",
    "the crosses will be discussed below .",
    "the modest scatter in civ / hi predicted by our uniform metallicity model arises from a scatter in physical densities and temperatures of the absorbing regions . because there exists a fairly tight correlation between hi column density and physical density and temperature in the model ( miralda - escud et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) , this scatter is small .",
    "the scatter in the observational data is seen to be at least an order of magnitude higher .",
    "we thus confirm the findings of rauch , haehnelt & steinmetz ( 1996 ) that significant spatial variations in metallicity are required in order to explain the observations of civ / hi in the high - redshift universe in the context of this model for the lyman alpha forest .    the model datapoints scale directly with the carbon abundance , and with [ c / h]@xmath59 the mean value of civ / hi of the points from the simulation above the sc detection limit ( dashed line ) matches that of the observational datapoints .",
    "essentially all systems with @xmath60 ( the lyman beta selected sample of sc ) have detectable civ absorption , and these systems constitute the major fraction of the observations . for lower values of @xmath61",
    "we expect an increasing fraction of the civ lines to lie below the detection limit , but if the systems with @xmath62 have the same metallicity distribution as the higher column density systems , the model still predicts that the density of observable systems around 14.8 should be several times larger than , say , around 15.5 . in the sc data ,",
    "only a small cluster of systems , with @xmath63 close to the detection limit , is found around 14.8 .",
    "this suggests that the mean metallity [ c / h ] of these lower column density systems is significantly less than @xmath5 , and that we are only observing the high - metallicity tail of a large population of systems with a mean civ / hi below the detectability limit .",
    "thus , comparing our model to observations indicates that low column density forest systems ( @xmath64 ) have a lower mean metallicity than the higher column density systems .",
    "this conclusion is clearly insensitive to the details of the adopted model : it holds for any model that predicts a roughly constant mean civ / hi value in the interval @xmath65 .",
    "gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) , simulating the reionization and metal enrichment of the universe by population iii stars , predict ( at @xmath66 ) a pattern of metal enrichment that fits our requirements remarkably well .",
    "they predict a mean metallicity of [ c / h]@xmath67 with a large scatter , similar to what we infer by comparing our simulation to the sc data .",
    "they further predict a dependence of metallicity on volume density ( and hence on column density , due to the correlation mentioned above ) because most of the star formation and subsequent enrichment of the surrounding igm take place within relatively dense regions , whereas regions with low densities corresponding to column densities @xmath68 have essentially no metals .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] also shows a sample of high column density systems ( @xmath69 ) with their civ / hi ratio shown as crosses .",
    "these lines of sight were pre - selected to have high total hi column density , in order to provide better statistics on the absorption properties of the relatively uncommon high column density systems .",
    "it is seen that the model predicts a systematically decreasing value of civ / hi with @xmath61 .",
    "this trend is consistent with the observations of sc , who find that lyman limit systems with @xmath70 have a mean log(civ / hi)@xmath71 and show that the trend can not be explained by radiative shielding effects alone .",
    "the physical reason for this trend in the model is the correlation between the hi column density and the physical gas density . for a homogeneous radiation field",
    ", the photoionization parameter , defined as the ratio of ionizing photons to free electrons , will be a decreasing function of @xmath61 .",
    "for relatively low values of @xmath61 , the civ column density increases slightly faster than @xmath61 with @xmath61 , so the civ / hi ratio is a weakly increasing function . when @xmath61 exceeds a value @xmath72 , @xmath63 starts to drop as the civ recombines to lower ionization states , causing the observed decrease in civ / hi .",
    "rauch et al .  ( 1996 ) find a similar trend of civ / hi with @xmath61 .",
    "for lyman limit systems ( @xmath73 ) the ionization parameter will decrease even faster with @xmath61 because the systems become increasingly opaque to the lyman limit photons of the background radiation .",
    "figures 3a3d show the magnitude and scatter of the column densities in civ , cii , siiv , and nv at five different redshifts . the systems studied here are chosen to mimic the lyman beta selected sample of sc : only systems that are lyman beta saturated ( @xmath74 ) are included , and of those , only systems with metal column densities larger than the detection limits of sc ( @xmath75 for cii , civ , nv , and @xmath76 for siiv ) are plotted . at @xmath49 ,",
    "98 of our 400 random los had absorbers with @xmath74 .",
    "we have adjusted the metallicity of our model of this high column density sample to [ c / h]@xmath77 , which reproduces the observed mean value @xmath78 . as expected from the discussion of figure 2 , the scatter in column density is less than observed , presumably because the model assumes a homogeneous metallicity distribution .",
    "the model shows no significant evolution in the mean column densities with redshift .",
    "this is consistent with what is seen observationally ( see figures 4a4d of sc ) .",
    "for civ , there is a hint of evolution , with the mean value of @xmath63 for @xmath1 , 2.3 , and 2.7 being around @xmath79 , while at @xmath49 and 3.5 it is around @xmath80 , but the scatter is consistent with no evolution . for the other species ,",
    "the observational detection limits combined with small numbers of detections make it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the redshift evolution of their mean column densities , but again the results are consistent with no evolution .",
    "the model also shows , at face value , that the number of detectable metal systems increases dramatically with redshift ( the larger number of points in figures 3a3d with increasing @xmath24 ) , an effect that is not nearly so pronounced in the observations .",
    "the increase arises partly as an artifact of our simulation volume representing a larger redshift interval at earlier times ( @xmath81 , and partly because the universe is physically denser at higher redshifts , causing an increase in the number of lyman alpha and weak metal absorption lines per unit wavelength .",
    "the model as well as the data show that while essentially all systems in the lyman beta selected sample have detectable civ absorption , only a fraction of the absorbers have column densities in siiv , cii , and nv above the detection limit . to check our model quantitatively ,",
    "we have taken the output at @xmath49 as representative for the sample observed by sc and added an additional gaussian scatter of @xmath82 ) = 0.8 $ ] in metallicity so that the observed scatter in @xmath63 is crudely reproduced .",
    "the column densities without and with this added scatter are displayed as triangles in figures 4 and 5 , respectively , and the corresponding fractions of the systems above the detection limit ( figure 5 ) are shown in column 1 of table 1 .",
    "this model is seen to predict too few siiv systems and too many nv systems relative to what is observed ( column 3 of table 1 ) .",
    "no reasonable changes in the relative abundances [ si / c ] and [ n / c ] can remove this discrepancy .",
    "if , however , the ionizing radiation field is softer than the hm spectrum we will , for the relevant ionization conditions in the lyman alpha absorbers , expect to see less nv ( more niv ) and more siiv ( less siv ) and civ , while cii has an ionization potential too low to be significantly affected .",
    "the model column densities after modifying the hm spectrum by reducing the intensity by a factor of 10 above 4 rydbergs are shown as circles in figure 4 and are seen to follow the expected trends .",
    "most dramatically , the many low column density siiv systems that exist in a hm field are seen to have column densities close to or above the detection limits after the removal of the energetic photons .",
    "the predicted distributions of column densities above the detection limit for the normal hm spectrum versus the softened background spectrum are plotted in figure 5 .",
    "gaussian scatter of @xmath82 ) = 0.8 $ ] has been added to both distributions , and the mean [ c / h ] in the softened model has been adjusted to fit the observed mean value of @xmath63 , requiring [ c / h]@xmath83 ( note the lower mean civ as compared with the circles in figure 4 ) .",
    "the fractions above the detection limits for the softened model are shown in column 2 of table 1 .",
    "for this choice of background radiation there is much better agreement between the predicted and observed metal line fractions for nv and siiv . because of the reduction in metallicity , however , slightly too few cii detections are now seen .",
    "also shown in table 1 is the mean heii optical depth in the models . cutting the number of heii ionizing photons by a factor of 10 increases @xmath84 from 1.6 to 3.6 .",
    "observational results by hogan , anderson & rugers ( 1996 ) indicate @xmath85 ( 95 % confidence level ) at @xmath86 , and at @xmath49 we would expect it to be somewhat less .",
    "a cut by a factor of 10 thus seems to be barely acceptable , and the spectrum giving the best fit to the observational data is probably somewhere in between the two extremes considered .",
    "alternatively , the observations could be accomodated if the ionizing background was inhomogeneous , and was softer in some regions compared with others due to varying distances from the nearest ionizing source .",
    "given the crudity of the approach made in producing figure 5 and table 1 and the still sparse amount of observational data , we will not attempt to infer any further details of the radiation field .",
    "we simply suggest , based on the above results , that the ionizing background photon field around @xmath49 is somewhat softer than the hm spectrum .",
    "we now consider the siiv / civ ratio as a signature for heii reionization .",
    "sc suggest that this ratio increases rather abruptly by a factor of a few around @xmath87 , and that this effect could be explained if the heii reionization redshift is around this value .",
    "while it is true that the siiv / civ ratio in a uniform density , one phase medium will increase as high energy photons are removed from the spectrum by heii absorption , the effect is different in our models . as can be seen from figure 4 , the mean column density of the _ observable _ siiv systems will not increase if the radiation field is softened , because of the numerous siiv systems getting shifted upwards to just above the detection limit .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath63 is seen to increase if the radiation field is softened , so the net effect is actually to _ decrease _ the siiv / civ ratio .",
    "if the observed increase in siiv / civ is real , we are seeing the first clear example of a failure of the model to reproduce observations .",
    "it should be remarked , however , that our model predicts optical depths for heii absorption that are consistent with observations without the need to assume heii reionization at @xmath87 ( croft et al .",
    "we have compared a cosmological simulation of the lyman alpha forest and associated metal lines to recent observations of civ , cii , siiv , and nv absorption in high - redshift qso spectra .",
    "our simulated spectra have signal - to - noise properties similar to those of the observed spectra , and we analyze them by a voigt - profile fitting procedure that is similar to that used in the observational analyses .",
    "we can examine our results from two different points of view .",
    "first , we can assume that our theoretical model provides an accurate description of physical conditions in the absorbing gas and use the comparison to the observations to draw inferences about metal enrichment of the igm and the spectral shape of the ionizing radiation background .",
    "second , we can ask whether the predicted properties of the igm are consistent with the metal line observations , within the uncertainties of the observations and the theoretical modeling . adopting the first point of view , we conclude :    1 .",
    "the mean metallicity of the igm at @xmath88 corresponds to [ c / h]@xmath59 .",
    "more specifically , for the lyman beta selected sample of sc ( @xmath60 ) , the inferred mean metallicity ranges from [ c / h]@xmath89 to [ c / h]@xmath90 , depending on the assumed spectral shape of the ionizing background .",
    "2 .   significant spatial variations of [ c / h ] , with an rms scatter of roughly one order of magnitude , are required to match the observed scatter in civ / hi .",
    "3 .   there is a trend between mean enrichment and hi column density ; lyman alpha absorbers with low hi column densities ( and correspondingly low physical densities ) have systematically lower metallicities .",
    "4 .   the ionizing background spectrum at @xmath91 must be somewhat softer than the spectrum predicted by hm , in order to explain the observed number of siiv systems .",
    "however , if the spectrum is too much softer than the hm spectrum , there will be conflict with the observed heii optical depth ( see croft et al .",
    "1996 ; davidsen , kriss , & zheng 1996 ; hogan et al .",
    "1996 ) .    the required enrichment of the igm ( mean value , scatter , and trend with density ) is very similar to that predicted by gnedin & ostriker s ( 1997 ) numerical simulations of metal enrichment and reionization by population iii stars .",
    "the required scatter in metallicity is also plausible on observational grounds , since it is similar to that seen in halo stars in our own galaxy ( e.g. ryan & norris 1991 ) .",
    "however , some of the observed scatter in civ / hi could also be contributed by inhomogeneities in the ionizing background instead of metallicity variations .    within the current uncertainties of the observational data and the theoretical modeling",
    ", we expect the predictions presented here to be generic to cosmological models that have similar amounts of small - scale power at @xmath92 .",
    "several results of our comparison support the adopted physical model of the high - redshift igm :    1 .   with plausible assumptions about enrichment and the ionizing background ,",
    "the model reproduces the observed abundances of civ , cii , siiv , and nv in lyman alpha forest systems fairly well .",
    "this agreement suggests that the predicted densities and temperatures of the absorbing gas are at least approximately correct .",
    "consistent with sc s observations , the model predicts no substantial evolution in the mean value of @xmath63 for lyman - beta - selected hi lines over the redshift range @xmath93 .",
    "the model successfully explains the observed trend towards lower civ / hi ratios in high column density systems ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "this trend arises because of the correlation between column density and physical density , which causes the stronger absorbers to have more of their carbon in lower ionization states .",
    "qualitatively , the model reproduces observations that show multiple civ components associated with strongly saturated lyman alpha lines ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "we will explore the model predictions more quantitatively in future work .",
    "the observation that is most difficult to explain in this model is the jump in the mean siiv / civ ratio at @xmath91 , which sc suggest is due to a rapid change in the shape of the ionizing background spectrum associated with heii reionization . in our model , there are many weak siiv systems below the sc detection threshold .",
    "softening the background spectrum moves these systems above the threshold , keeping the mean siiv column density low .    to the extent that the analyses overlap , our conclusions agree well with those of haehnelt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and rauch et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , despite differences in the numerical techniques , in the mass resolution of the simulations , and in the type of simulations ( a single large box representing a randomly selected volume vs.  multiple , higher resolution simulations focused on collapsing regions ) .",
    "there are many potential improvements for future modeling , including higher resolution of the gas dynamics to better describe the structures giving rise to the moderate column density systems where metals are detected , a non - equilibrium treatment of the ionization of all species , and explicit incorporation of spatial variations in the metallicity of the gas and the intensity and shape of the background radiation field .",
    "future studies can also examine alternative reionization scenarios and other cosmological models , to see which theories of cosmic structure formation can account for metal line absorption in the high - redshift universe .",

    "<S> we study metal line absorption of civ , cii , siiv , and nv at redshifts @xmath0 to @xmath1 within the framework of a cosmological model for the lyman alpha forest , comparing the results of numerical simulations to recent observations by songaila & cowie ( 1996 , sc ) . in agreement with rauch , haehnelt & steinmetz ( 1996 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the observed mean value of the civ / hi ratio at @xmath2 is reproduced if a uniform metallicity of @xmath3\\sim -2.5 $ ] is assumed in our model , but that the observed scatter in this ratio is larger than predicted , implying a scatter in the metallicity of the absorbing systems of roughly an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we further argue that absorbers with relatively low column densities ( @xmath4 ) likely have a mean metallicity [ c / h ] less than @xmath5 , a result which is basically independent of the model considered . </S>",
    "<S> the enrichment pattern that is required for our model to match sc s civ observations is very similar to that _ predicted _ by gnedin & ostriker s ( 1997 ) simulations of reionization and metal enrichment by population iii stars in this type of cosmological scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> our model predicts no significant evolution in the mean values of metal line column densities between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the predicted and observed numbers of siiv and nv systems suggests that the photoionizing background radiation field at @xmath6 is somewhat softer than that proposed by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our model does not account for the increase in the siiv / civ ratio at @xmath7 found by sc . </S>",
    "<S> while sc suggested that the increase could be explained by a softening of the radiation field due to heii absorption at @xmath8 , such a modification does not significantly raise the mean value of siiv / civ in our simulation because it shifts numerous weak siiv systems to just above the detection limit , thus keeping the mean column density of observable siiv systems low .    </S>",
