    "direct electrical coupling through gap - junctions is a common way of communication between neurons , as well as between cells of the heart , pancreas , and other physiological systems @xcite .",
    "electrical synapses are important for synchronization of the network activity , wave propagation , and pattern formation in neuronal networks . a prominent example of a gap - junctionally coupled network , whose dynamics is thought to be important for cognitive processing , is a group of neurons in the locus coeruleus ( lc ) , a nucleus in the brainstem @xcite .",
    "electrophysiological studies of the animals performing a visual discrimination test show that the rate and the pattern of activity of the lc network correlate with the cognitive performance @xcite .",
    "specifically , the periods of the high spontaneous activity correspond to the periods of poor performance , whereas the periods of low synchronized activity coincide with good performance . based on the physiological properties of the lc network , it was proposed that the transitions between the periods of high and low network activity are due to the variations in the strength of coupling between the lc neurons @xcite .",

    "following @xcite , we assume that the individual neurons in the lc network are spontaneously active .",
    "specifically , we model them with excitable dynamical systems forced by small noise .",
    "we show that depending on the strength of electrical coupling , there are three main regimes of the network dynamics : uncorrelated spontaneous firing ( weak coupling ) , formation of clusters and waves ( intermediate coupling ) , and synchrony ( strong coupling ) .",
    "the qualitative features of these regimes are independent from the details of the models of the individual neurons and network topology .",
    "using the center manifold reduction @xcite and the freidlin - wentzell large deviation theory @xcite , we derive a variational problem , which provides a useful geometric interpretation for various patterns of spontaneous activity .",
    "specifically , we show that the location of the minima of a certain continuous function on the surface of the unit @xmath0cube encodes the most likely activity patterns generated by the network . by studying the evolution of the minima of this function under the variation of the control parameter ( coupling strength ) , we identify the principal transformations in the network dynamics . the minimization problem is also used for the quantitative description of the main dynamical regimes and transitions between them . in particular , for the weak and strong coupling regimes , we present asymptotic formulae for the activity rate as a function of the coupling strength and the degree of the network .",

    "first , we rewrite ( [ expect ] ) and ( [ asymptot ] ) , using the original time @xmath322 where @xmath323 . equation ( [ first ] ) shows that the rate of convergence to the synchronous state depends on the coupling strength , @xmath66 , and the algebraic connectivity of the network , @xmath64 .",
    "the convergence is faster for stronger coupling and larger @xmath64 .",
    "this , in particular , implies that the rate of convergence to synchrony in networks on spectral expanders ( cf .",
    "example  [ ex.5 ] ) remains @xmath324 as the size of the network grows without bound .",
    "in particular , the families of the random graphs ( cf .",
    "example  [ ex.4 ] ) have this property .",
    "in contrast , for many networks with symmetries ( cf .",
    "example  [ ex.2 ] ) the algebraic connectivity @xmath325 as @xmath326 , and , therefore , by ( [ first ] ) , synchronization requires longer time , if the size of the network grows . for a more detailed discussion of the synchronization properties of the networks on expanders , we refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "next , we turn to equation ( [ second ] ) , which characterizes the dispersion of the trajectories around the synchronization subspace . @xmath327 may be viewed as a measure of robustness of synchrony to noise or , more generally , to constantly acting perturbations . by ( [ second ] ) , the synchrony is more robust for stronger coupling , because the asymptotic value of @xmath328 as @xmath329 .",
    "the contribution of the network topology to the mean - square stability of the synchronous state is reflected in @xmath330 .",
    "trajectories of the networks with smaller @xmath330 are more tightly localized around the synchronization subspace .    to explain the graph - theoretic interpretation of @xmath330 , we review the structure of the cycle subspace of @xmath31 . recall that the edge set of the spanning tree @xmath331 consists of the first @xmath54 edges ( see ( [ spanning ] ) ) : @xmath332 if @xmath31 is not a tree , then @xmath333 where @xmath334 is the corank of @xmath31 .",

    "in this paper , we presented a variational method , which reduces the problem of pattern - formation in electrically coupled networks of neurons to the minimization problem for the potential function @xmath126 on the surface of a unit @xmath0cube , @xmath112 .",
    "the variational problem provides geometric interpretation for the spontaneous dynamics generated by the network .",
    "specifically , the location of the points of minima of the constrained potential function @xmath351 corresponds to the most likely patterns of network activity .",
    "the variational formulation has several important implications for the analysis of the dynamical problem .",
    "first , the minimization problem has an intrinsic bifurcation structure . by a bifurcation of the problem ( [ min ] ) , it is natural to call the value of the parameter @xmath352 corresponding to the structural changes in the singularity set of @xmath353 .",
    "for example , the number of the minima of @xmath353 can change due to collisions of the singularities with each other or with the boundaries of the faces of a given co - dimension ( a border collision bifurcation ) . in either case , the qualitative change in the configuration of the points of minima of @xmath353 signals the transformation of the attractor of the randomly perturbed system ( [ diffusion ] ) .",
    "the study of the constrained minimization problem ( [ min ] ) identified three main regimes in the network dynamics for weak , intermediate , and strong coupling .",
    "these results hold for any connected network .",
    "we expect that under certain assumptions on the network topology ( e.g. , in the presence of symmetries , or alternatively in networks with random connections ) , a more detailed description of the bifurcation events preceding complete synchronization should be possible .",
    "the analysis of the variational problem has also helped to obtain quantitative estimates for the network dynamics .",
    "for both weak and strong coupling , we derived the asymptotic formulae for the dependence of the firing rate as a function of the coupling strength ( see ( [ valeps1 ] ) and ( [ u - lambda - min ] ) ) .",
    "surprisingly , in each of these cases , the firing rate does not depend on the structure of the graph of the network beyond its degree and order . in particular , the network of equal degree with connectivity patterns as different as symmetric and random exhibit the same activity rate ( see fig .  [",
    "f.4]c ) .",
    "the geometric interpretation of the spontaneous dynamics yields a novel mechanism of the formation of clusters .",
    "it shows that the network fires in @xmath49clusters , whenever @xmath126 has a minimum on a co - dimension @xmath354 $ ] face of @xmath112 . in particular , the network becomes completely synchronized , when the minimum of @xmath126 reaches @xmath355 .",
    "this observation allows one to estimate the onset of synchronization ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ small - lambda ] ) and cluster formation ( cf .",
    "lemma  [ cluster ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we show that in the strong coupling regime , the network dynamics has two disparate timescales : fast synchronization is followed by an ultra - slow escape from the potential well . the analysis of the slow - fast system yields estimates of stability of the synchronous state in terms of the coupling strength and structural properties of the network . in particular",
    ", it shows the contribution of the network topology to the synchronization properties of the network .",
    "we end this paper with a few concluding remarks about the implications of this work for the lc network .",
    "the analysis of the conductance - based model of the lc network in this paper agrees with the study of the integrate - and - fire neuron network in @xcite and confirms that the assumptions of spontaneously active lc neurons coupled electrically with a variable coupling strength are consistent with the experimental observations of the lc network .",
    "following the observations in @xcite that stronger coupling slows down network activity , we have studied how the firing rate depends on the coupling strength .",
    "we show that strong coupling results in synchronization and significantly decreases the firing rate ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly , we found that the rate can be effectively controlled by the strength of interactions already for very weak coupling .",
    "we show that the dependence of the firing rate on the strength of coupling is nonmonotone .",
    "this has an important implication for the interpretation of the experimental data . because two distinct firing patterns can have similar firing rates ,",
    "the firing rate alone does not determine the response of the network to external stimulation .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "we choose parameters such that two networks , the spontaneously active ( fig .",
    "[ f.9]a ) and the nearly synchronous one ( fig .",
    "[ f.9]b ) , exhibit about the same activity rates ( see fig .",
    "[ f.9]c , d ) . however , because the activity patterns generated by these networks are different , so are their responses to stimulation ( fig .",
    "[ f.9]e , f ) .",
    "the network in the spontaneous firing regime produces a barely noticeable response ( fig .",
    "[ f.9]g ) , whereas the response of the synchronized network is pronounced ( fig .  [ f.9]h ) .",
    "network responses similar to these were observed experimentally and are associated with the good ( fig .",
    "[ f.9]h ) and poor ( fig .",
    "[ f.9]g ) cognitive performance @xcite .",
    "our analysis suggests that the state of the network ( i.e. , the spatio - temporal dynamics ) rather than the firing rate , determines the response of the lc network to afferent stimulation .",
    "the main hypotheses used in our analysis are that the local dynamical systems satisfy assumption  [ sn ] and interact through electrical coupling .",
    "the latter means that the coupling is realized through one of the local variables , interpreted as voltage , and is subject to the two kirchhoff s laws for electrical circuits . in this form",
    "our assumptions cover many biological , physical , and technological problems , including power grids , sensor and communication networks , and consensus protocols for coordination of autonomous agents ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
