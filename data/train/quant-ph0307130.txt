    "in multipartite quantum systems one can in many cases identify constituents that directly interact with each other , whereas other interactions play a minor role and can largely be neglected .",
    "for example , next - neighbor interactions in coupled systems are often by far dominant .",
    "such quantum systems may be represented by a graph @xcite , where the vertices correspond to the physical systems , and the edges represent interactions .",
    "the concept of a graph state  which abstracts from the actual realization in a physical system  is based on this intuition .",
    "a graph state , as it is used in this paper , is a special pure multi - party quantum state of a distributed quantum system .",
    "it corresponds to a graph in that each edge represents an ising interaction between pairs of quantum spin systems or qubits @xcite .",
    "special instances of graph states are codewords of various quantum error correcting codes @xcite , which are of central importance when protecting quantum states against decoherence in quantum computation @xcite .",
    "other examples are multi - party ghz states with applications in quantum communication , or cluster states of arbitrary dimensions , which are known to serve as a universal resource for quantum computation in the one - way quantum computer @xcite . yet ,",
    "not only the cluster state itself is a graph state . but also the pure state that is obtained from this universal resource after the appropriate steps have been taken to implement operations taken from the clifford group .",
    "this resource is then no longer universal , but the specific resource for a particular quantum computation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the issue of quantifying and characterizing the entanglement of these multi - particle entangled states of arbitrary number of constituents .",
    "the aim is to apply the quantitative theory of multi - particle entanglement to the study of correlations in graph states .",
    "the underlying measure of entanglement is taken to be the schmidt measure @xcite , which is a proper multi - particle entanglement monotone that is tailored to the characterization of such states .",
    "as holds true for any known measure of multi - particle entanglement , its computation is exceedingly difficult for general states , yet for graph states this task becomes feasible to a very high extent .",
    "we start by presenting general transformation rules of graphs when local pauli measurements are applied locally on physical systems represented by vertices .",
    "we present various upper and lower bounds for the schmidt measure in graph theoretical terms , which largely draw from the stabilizer theory .",
    "these bounds allow for an evaluation of the schmidt measure for a large number of graphs of practical importance .",
    "we discuss these rules for the class of @xmath0-colorable graphs , which is of special practical importance in the context of entanglement purification @xcite . for this class",
    "we give bounds to the schmidt measure , that are particularly easy to compute .",
    "moreover , we provide criteria for the equivalence of graph states under local unitary transformations entirely on the level of the underlying graphs .",
    "finally , we present several examples , including trees , cluster states , states that occur in the context of quantum error correction , such as the css code , and the graph that is used to realize the quantum fourier transformation ( qft ) on three qubits in the one - way quantum computer .",
    "the vision behind this is to flesh out the notion of entanglement as an algorithmic resource , as it has been put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we start by introducing the notion of graph states of multi - qubit systems : we set the notation concerning graph theoretical terms , and proceed by showing how graph states are in correspondence to graphs .",
    "then , we recapitulate relevant properties of the schmidt measure as a measure of multi - particle entanglement . in sec .",
    "[ general ] we then state general upper and lower bounds that are formulated in the language of graph theory .",
    "we also investigate the equivalence class for connected graphs up to seven vertices under local unitaries and graph isomorphisms .",
    "these statements are the main results of the paper .",
    "they are proved in sec",
    ".  [ proofs ] .",
    "we proceed by discussing the above mentioned examples , where we use the developed methods . finally , we summarize what has been achieved , and sketch further interesting steps of future research .",
    "this paper is concerned with entanglement in multi - particle distributed quantum systems , with some resemblance to refs.@xcite . however , here we are less interested in the connection between quantum correlations and quantum phase transition , but rather in the entanglement of graph states that have definite applications in quantum information theory .",
    "entangled states associated with graphs have also been studied in refs.@xcite , where bounds on shared bipartite entanglement in multipartite quantum systems have been studied , in order to find general rules for sharing of entanglement in a multipartite setting .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the way in which we represent entangled states by mathematical graphs is entirely different from the way this is done in refs .",
    "furthermore , in the present paper , we are not only concerned with bipartite entanglement between two constituents or two groups of constituents , but with multi - particle entanglement between many constituents . in turn , the interaction that gives rise to the entangled graph states is more specific , namely the one corresponding to an ising interaction . finally , as discussed above , graph states provide an interesting class of genuine multipartite entangled states that are relatively easy to survey even in the regime of many parties .",
    "since the graph essentially encodes a preparation procedure of the state , we will mainly examine the question of how the entanglement in a graph state is related to the topology of its underlying graph .",
    "at the basis of our analysis lies the concept of a graph @xcite .",
    "a graph is a collection of vertices and a description of which vertices are connected by an edge . each graph can be represented by a diagram in a plane , where each vertex is represented by a point and each edge by an arc joining two not necessarily distinct vertices . in this pictorial representation",
    "many concepts related to graphs can be visualized in a transparent manner . in the context of the present paper",
    ", physical systems will take the role of vertices , whereas edges represent an interaction .",

    "the elements of @xmath4 are called _ vertices _ , the elements of @xmath5 _ edges_. in the following we will only consider _ simple _ graphs , which are graphs , that contain neither loops ( edges connecting vertices with itself ) nor multiple edges .    when the vertices @xmath6 are the endpoints of an edge , they are referred to as being _",

    "a vertex @xmath11 with an empty neighborhood will be called _ isolated vertex_.    for the purpose of later use , we will also introduce the concept of a connected graph .",
    "an @xmath15-path is an ordered list of vertices @xmath16 , such that for all @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are adjacent .",

    "they define a complete set of commuting observables of the system of qubits associated with the vertex set @xmath4 .",
    "thus , they have a common set of eigenvectors , the _ graph states _",
    "@xcite , which form a basis of the hilbert space @xmath45 . for our present purposes , it is sufficient to choose one of these eigenvectors as a representative of all graph states associated with @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath24 also describes a certain encoding procedure .",

    "the schmidt measure is a multi - particle entanglement monotone @xcite .",
    "the fact that it is a non - continuous functional on state space is a weakness when considering bipartite entanglement ( where it merely reduces to the logarithm of the schmidt rank for pure states ) and in those few - partite cases where other measures are still feasible to some extent .",
    "however , for the present purposes it turns out to be just the appropriate tool that is suitable for characterising the multi - particle entanglement of graph states associated with potentially very many vertices .    moreover , it should be noted that for general pure states of multipartite quantum systems the schmidt measure is  as any other measure of multipartite entanglement  exceedingly difficult to compute . in order to determine the schmidt measure @xmath94 , one has to show that a given decomposition in eq .",

    "this illustrates that the determination of the schmidt measure for a general state can be a very difficult problem of numerical analysis , which scales exponentially in the number of parties @xmath77 as well as in the degree of entanglement of the state itself ( in terms of the schmidt measure @xmath94 ) .",
    "remember , however , that the graph states themselves represent already a large class of genuine multipartite entangled states that are relatively easy to survey even in the regime of many parties .",
    "a numerical analysis @xcite seems still unrealistic in this regime , at least until simpler procedures or generic arguments are found . in the following",
    ", we will provide lower and upper bounds for the schmidt measure of graph states in graph theoretic terms , which will coincide in many cases .",
    "because of the complexity of the numerical reformulation given above , we will omit the computation of the exact value for the schmidt measure in those cases , where lower and upper bounds do not coincide . we will now turn to formulating general rules that can be applied when evaluating the schmidt measure on graph states for a given graph .",
    "in this section we will present general rules that give rise to upper and lower bounds for the schmidt measure , that render the actual evaluation of the schmidt measure feasible in most cases .",

    "more precisely , consider a graph state vector @xmath46 which is stabilized by @xmath133 and on which a pauli measurement is performed .",

    "in this paper we have developed methods that allow for a qualitative and quantitative description of the multi - particle entanglement that one encounters in graph states .",
    "such graph states capture the intuition of an interaction pattern between quantum systems , with important applications in quantum error correction , quantum communication , and quantum computation in the context of the one - way quantum computer .",
    "the schmidt measure is tailored for a comparably detailed account on the quantum correlations grasping genuine multi - particle entanglement , yet it turns out to be computable for many graph states .",
    "we have presented a number of general rules that can be applied when approaching the problem of evaluating the schmidt measure for general graph states , which are stated mostly in graph theoretical terms .",
    "these rules have then been applied to a number of graph states that appear in quantum computation and error correction . also , all connected graphs with up to seven vertices have been discussed in detail .",
    "the formalism that we present here abstracts from the actual physical realisation , but as has been pointed out in several instances , a number of well - controllable physical systems such as neutral atoms in optical lattices serve as potential candidates to realize such graph states @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the schmidt measure has been employed to quantify the degree of entanglement , as a generalization of the schmidt rank in the bipartite setting .",
    "this measure is sufficiently coarse to be accessible for systems consisting of many constituents and to allow for an appropriate discussion of multi - particle entanglement in graph states .",
    "the approach of quantifying entanglement in terms of rates of asymptotic reversible state transformations , as an alternative , appears unfeasible in the many - partite setting .",
    "the question of the minimal reversible entangling generating set ( mregs ) in multipartite systems remains unresolved to date , even for quantum systems consisting of three qubits , and despite considerable research effort @xcite .",
    "these mregs are the ( not necessarily finite ) sets of those pure states from which any other pure states can be asymptotically prepared in a reversible manner under local operations with classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "hence , it seems unrealistic to date to expect to be able to characterize multi - particle entanglement by the rates that can be achieved in reversible asymptotic state transformations , analogous to the entanglement cost and the distillable entanglement under locc operations in bipartite systems . in turn , such a description , if it was to be found , could well turn out to be too detailed to capture entanglement as an algorithmic resource in the context of error correction or the one - way quantum computer , where , needless to say , distributed quantum systems with very many constituents are encountered .    for",
    "future investigations , a more feasible characterization of lu equivalence would open up further possibilities .",
    "a step that would go significantly beyond the treatment of the present paper would be to consider measurements corresponding to observables not contained in the pauli - group .",
    "unfortunately , in this case the stabilizer formalism is no longer available , at least not in the way we used it in this paper .",
    "such an extension would , however , allow for a complete monitoring of the entanglement resource as it is processed during a quantum computation in the one - way computer , where also measurements in tilted bases play a role .    finally , taking a somewhat different perspective",
    ", one could also extend the identification of edges with interactions to weighted graphs , where a real positive number associated with each edge characterizes the interaction strength ( e.g. , the interaction time ) .",
    "with such a notion at hand , one could study the quantum correlations as they emerge in more natural systems .",
    "one example is given by a boltzmann system of particles , where each particle follows a classical trajectory but carries a quantum degree of freedom that is affected whenever two particles scatter .",
    "with techniques of random graphs , it would be interesting to investigate what kind of multi - particle correlations are being built up when the system starts from a prescribed initial state , or to study the steady state .",
    "the answer to these questions depends on the knowledge of the interaction history .",
    "a hypothetical observer who is aware of the exact distribution in classical phase space ( laplacian demon perspective ) would assign a definite graph corresponding to a pure entangled state to the ensemble .",
    "an observer who lacks all or part of this classical information about the particles trajectories would describe the state by a random mixture of graphs and corresponding quantum states .",
    "one example of this latter situation would be a maxwell demon scenario in which one studies the bipartite entanglement as it builds up between two parts of a container .",
