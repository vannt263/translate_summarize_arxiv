    "neutron stars ( nss ) are endowed with magnetic fields far beyond the reach of terrestrial laboratories @xcite . most of the @xmath12 known radio pulsars have surface magnetic fields in the range of @xmath13  g , as inferred from their measured spin periods and period derivatives and the assumption that the spindown is due to magnetic dipole radiation . a smaller population of older , millisecond pulsars have @xmath14  g. for about a dozen accreting neutron stars in binary systems , electron cyclotron features have been detected , implying surface fields of @xmath15  g. an important development in astrophysics in the last decade centered on the so - called anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft gamma repeaters @xcite : there has been mounting observational evidence in recent years that supports the idea that these are magnetars , neutron stars whose radiations are powered by superstrong magnetic fields of order @xmath16  g or higher @xcite . by contrast , the highest static magnetic field currently produced in a terrestrial laboratory is @xmath17  g ; transient fields approaching @xmath18  g have recently been generated during high - intensity laser interactions with dense plasmas @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the properties of matter can be drastically modified by strong magnetic fields found on neutron star surfaces .",
    "the natural atomic unit for the magnetic field strength , @xmath19 , is set by equating the electron cyclotron energy @xmath20  kev , where @xmath21 , to the characteristic atomic energy @xmath22  ev ( where @xmath23 is the bohr radius ) : b_0=m_e^2e^3c^3=2.350510 ^ 9 g. [ eqb0 ] for @xmath24 , the usual perturbative treatment of the magnetic effects on matter ( e.g. , zeeman splitting of atomic energy levels ) does not apply .",
    "instead , in the transverse direction ( perpendicular to the field ) the coulomb forces act as a perturbation to the magnetic forces , and the electrons in an atom settle into the ground landau level . because of the extreme confinement of the electrons in the transverse direction , the coulomb force becomes much more effective in binding the electrons along the magnetic field direction .",
    "the atom attains a cylindrical structure .",
    "moreover , it is possible for these elongated atoms to form molecular chains by covalent bonding along the field direction .",
    "interactions between the linear chains can then lead to the formation of three - dimensional condensed matter @xcite .",
    "our main motivation for studying matter in such strong magnetic fields arises from the importance of understanding neutron star surface layers , which play a key role in many neutron star processes and observed phenomena .",
    "theoretical models of pulsar and magnetar magnetospheres depend on the cohesive properties of the surface matter in strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "for example , depending on the cohesive energy of the surface matter , an acceleration zone ( `` polar gap '' ) above the polar cap of a pulsar may or may not form . more importantly , the surface layer directly mediates the thermal radiations from neutron stars .",
    "the advent of x - ray telescopes in recent years has made detailed study of neutron star surface emission a reality .",
    "such study can potentially provide invaluable information on the physical properties and evolution of nss : equation of state at supernuclear densities , superfluidity , cooling history , magnetic field , surface composition , different ns populations , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "more than two dozen isolated neutron stars ( including radio pulsars , radio - quiet neutron stars and magnetars ) have clearly detected thermal surface emission @xcite . while some neutron stars show featureless spectra , absorption lines or features",
    "have been detected in half a dozen or so systems @xcite . indeed , many of the observed neutron stars have sufficiently low surface temperatures and/or high magnetic fields , such that bound atoms or molecules are expected to be present in their atmospheres @xcite .",
    "it is even possible that the atmosphere is condensed into a solid or liquid form from which radiation directly emerges @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to properly interpret various observations of neutron stars , it is crucial to have a detailed understanding of the properties of atoms , molecules and condensed matter in strong magnetic fields ( @xmath25-@xmath26  g ) .",
    "h and he atoms at almost all field strengths have been well studied @xcite , including the nontrivial effect associated with the center - of - mass motion of a h atom @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented numerical results for several atoms up to @xmath27 ( fe ) at @xmath28  g based on calculations using a one - dimensional hartree - fock method ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath29 up to 10 ) . some results [ based on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) mesh hartree - fock method ] for atoms ( up to @xmath30 ) at the field strengths @xmath31 are also available @xcite .",
    "the hartree - fock method is approximate because electron correlations are neglected . due to their mutual repulsion ,",
    "any pair of electrons tend to be more distant from each other than the hartree - fock wave function would indicate . in zero - field , this correlation effect is especially pronounced for the spin - singlet states of electrons for which the spatial wave function is symmetrical . in strong magnetic fields ( @xmath32 ) ,",
    "the electron spins ( in the ground state ) are all aligned antiparallel to the magnetic field , and the multielectron spatial wave function is antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of two electrons .",
    "thus the error in the hartree - fock approach is expected to be less than the @xmath33 accuracy characteristic of zero - field hartree - fock calculations @xcite .",
    "other calculations of heavy atoms in strong magnetic fields include thomas - fermi type statistical models @xcite and density functional theory @xcite .",
    "the thomas - fermi type models are useful in establishing asymptotic scaling relations , but are not adequate for obtaining accurate binding and excitation energies . the density functional theory can potentially give results as accurate as the hartree - fock method after proper calibration is made @xcite .",
    "quantitative results for the energies of hydrogen molecules h@xmath2 with @xmath34 in a wide range of field strengths ( @xmath32 ) were obtained ( based on the hartree - fock method ) by lai _",

    "our calculations are based on density functional theory @xcite . as mentioned above",
    ", the hartree - fock method is expected to be highly accurate , particularly in the strong field regime where the electron spins are aligned with each other . in this regime",
    "the density functional method is not as accurate , due to the lack of an exact correlation function for electrons in strong magnetic fields .",
    "however , in dealing with systems with many electrons , the hartree - fock method becomes increasingly impractical as the magnetic field increases , since more and more landau orbitals ( even though electrons remain in the ground landau level ) are occupied and keeping track of the direct and exchange interactions between electrons in various orbitals becomes computationally rather tedious .",
    "our density - functional calculations allow us to obtain the energies of atoms and small molecules and the energy of condensed matter using the same method , thus providing reliable cohesive energy of condensed surface of magnetic neutron stars , a main goal of our study . compared to previous density - functional - theory calculations",
    "@xcite , we use an improved exchange - correlation function for highly magnetized electron gases , we calibrate our density functional code with previous results ( when available ) based on other methods , and ( for calculations of condensed matter ) adopt a more accurate treatment of the band structure . moreover , our calculations extend to the magnetar - like field regime ( @xmath41  g ) .    note that in this paper we neglect the motions of the nuclei , due to electron - nucleus interactions or finite temperatures .",

    "a thomas - fermi type model for the atom is appropriate , i.e. , the electrons can be treated as a one - dimensional fermi gas in a more or less spherical atomic cell ( see , e.g. , refs .",
