    "vector - like quarks are hypothetical spin 1/2 particles that transform as triplets under the colour gauge group and whose left- and right - handed components have the same colour and electroweak quantum numbers .",
    "these new particles are receiving a lot of attention for several reasons . to start with , they are the simplest example of coloured fermions still allowed by experimental data . indeed , extra quarks with chiral couplings , such as fourth generation quarks , are now excluded  @xcite by the recent measurements of higgs - mediated cross sections  @xcite , when combined with direct searches at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "vector - like quarks , on the other hand , do not receive their masses from yukawa couplings to a higgs doublet , and are consistent with existing higgs data .",
    "secondly , they can mix with the standard model ( sm ) quarks and thereby modify their couplings to the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and higgs boson . indeed , the addition of vector - like quarks to the sm is the simplest way of breaking the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani  @xcite mechanism , giving rise for example to tree - level flavour - changing neutral currents  @xcite and potentially striking new effects in low energy physics , none of which have been observed , however . in this respect ,",
    "new vector - like quarks also introduce new sources of cp violation  @xcite , as it typically occurs in most sm extensions . in the third place , they can be analysed in a model - independent approach in terms of just a few free parameters .",
    "finally , vector - like quarks at the tev scale are strongly motivated by at least two theoretical ideas , which are often put together : they are required if the higgs is a pseudo - goldstone boson to induce electroweak breaking and explain the observed lightness of the higgs  @xcite , and they emerge as fermion resonances in the partial - compositeness theory of flavour  @xcite . due to the large yukawa coupling of the top quark ,",
    "both mechanisms give rise to a sizable mixing of the new quarks with the third family of sm quarks , hence the name `` top partners '' , often used in this context .",
    "of course , vector - like quarks do arise in all explicit models that implement these ideas , such as little higgs and composite higgs models , or their holographic versions .",
    "they also appear in any model with quarks propagating in the bulk of extra dimensions and in grand unified and string theories based on the group @xmath10  @xcite , although in this case they are not guaranteed to be near the tev scale .",
    "extra heavy quarks can be pair produced at hadron colliders through their gauge couplings to gluons , with a strength given by the strong coupling constant , @xmath11 . unlike fermions in other colour representations , they subsequently decay into sm particles , namely ordinary quarks plus a higgs or a gauge boson , with branching ratios that are mostly determined by their gauge quantum numbers .",
    "these decays occur through the mixing of the new quarks with the sm ones .",
    "the very same mixing gives rise to two other important effects : it produces a modification of the couplings of the sm quarks ( more precisely , of the lighter eigenstates ) , and it opens up the possibility of single production of the new quarks ( the heavier eigenstates ) , which becomes the dominant production mechanism for high enough masses .    in this paper , we analyse the observable consequences of the mixing between sm and extra vector - like quarks , with emphasis on the connection between them .",
    "we find limits on the mixings from electroweak precision data at the @xmath8 pole , and use them to extract the allowed values for the mass splittings of the new quarks , their decay branching ratios , the rates of single production and the deviations in the couplings of the known quarks .",
    "we follow a model - independent approach by studying all the gauge - covariant fermion multiplets that can mix with the sm quarks via renormalisable couplings , with the implicit assumption that the scalar sector comprises only @xmath12 doublets , as is the case of the sm .",
    "the possible multiplets have been classified in  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that there are only seven possibilities , so a comprehensive study is a relatively simple task .",
    "this systematic approach has already been applied to pair production of vector - like quarks in  @xcite .",
    "( see also  @xcite . )    in order to simplify the analysis , we assume that the vector - like quarks only couple to the quarks of the third family ( for a more detailed discussion see  @xcite ) .",
    "as we have mentioned above , this pattern of mixing is well motivated by the large yukawa coupling of the top quark , which suggests a close connection of the top quark ( and the left - handed component of the bottom quark ) with any new physics related to electroweak symmetry breaking or to the fermion mass hierarchy . from an experimental point of view",
    ", predominant mixing with the third generation is favoured as well . in the down sector",
    ", it helps in avoiding flavour problems , thanks to the hierarchical structure of the ckm matrix , although exclusive mixing with the @xmath13 or @xmath14 quarks is also allowed . in the up sector",
    "the mixing with the @xmath15 or @xmath16 quarks is subdominant if only one vector - like multiplet is included , but it leads to interesting flavour - changing neutral top interactions  @xcite .",
    "electroweak precision observables are sensitive to the sum of the different possible new physics contributions .",
    "for this reason , to extract precise limits on new particles it is always necessary to make some assumption that restricts new effects on electroweak precision data .",
    "we make an unbiased choice based on minimality : we consider extensions of the sm with all possible vector - like quark multiplets , but only one at a time , and further assume that no additional new physics modifies the electroweak observables .",
    "the bounds on the mixings we derive in this fashion are conservative for most new physics scenarios .",
    "indeed , due to the large range of electroweak observables and the combination of tree - level and loop contributions , additional multiplets or other new physics effects typically increase the @xmath17 of the fits @xcite .",
    "however , one should always keep in mind the existence of models that are constructed to enforce cancellations that relax the bounds , possibly with the aid of symmetries .",
    "well motivated examples are given by realistic composite higgs models , based on  @xcite , which contain several vector - like multiplets and incorporate a custodial protection at the tree level of the t parameter  @xcite and the ratio @xmath18 of the partial width for @xmath0 over the total hadronic @xmath8 width .",
    "such models  @xcite are not covered by the analysis in this paper .",
    "they require dedicated examinations of their electroweak constraints ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and their lhc implications ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we anticipate that , for most multiplets , the electroweak constraints that we derive with our assumptions are quite tight , and preclude a clear observation of deviations in the couplings of the top quark at the lhc and the international linear collider ( ilc ) . on the other hand , we find that a quark doublet with hypercharge @xmath1 has relatively weak bounds and can actually improve significantly the electroweak fit by reconciling , with just one free parameter , the predictions for @xmath18 and the forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry in @xmath19 , @xmath20 , with their observed values at the large electron positron collider ( lep ) and the stanford linear collider ( slc )  @xcite .",
    "this remarkably simple explanation of the long - standing @xmath20 anomaly was originally proposed in @xcite .",
    "close to its sm value ( see  @xcite for a dedicated analysis of the lhc phenomenology of this model ) . here",
    "we explore the simplest possibility of fitting the electroweak data with only one multiplet . ]",
    "it predicts a large single production rate of an extra quark of electric charge @xmath21 , with a visible signal at the lhc .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : mix ] we introduce the seven vector - like quark multiplets and describe their mixing with the third family of sm quarks . in section  [ sec : lim ] we obtain limits on these mixings and the masses of the new quarks from the relevant electroweak precision data , namely oblique parameters and @xmath22 observables .",
    "section  [ sec : higgs ] contains a brief discussion on the possible effects in higgs production and decay . in section  [ sec : dec ] we study the allowed splittings of masses and the allowed branching ratios for the decay of all the different extra quarks . in section  [ sec : xsec ] we analyse the allowed single production cross sections at the lhc . in section  [ sec : top ] we discuss the allowed deviations of top couplings and the expectations for measurements at the lhc and ilc .",
    "section  [ sec : fit ] is devoted to the vector - like - quark explanation of the @xmath20 lep anomaly and its observable consequences at the lhc .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : sum ] . finally , appendix  [ sec : a ] collects the analytical expressions for all the couplings of light and heavy quarks to the gauge bosons and the higgs , and appendix  [ sec : b ] the partial widths for the different heavy quark decay modes .",
    "if the scalar sector only includes @xmath12 doublets , as is the case of the sm , new vector - like quarks coupling to the sm ones with renormalisable couplings can only appear in seven gauge - covariant multiplets with definite @xmath23 quantum numbers  @xcite : @xmath24 we use in this section a zero superscript on weak eigenstates to distinguish them from mass eigenstates ; this superscript will be omitted when it is clear from the context .",
    "the new fields @xmath25 , @xmath26 have electric charges @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "note that some of the multiplets include quarks @xmath29 of electric charge @xmath30 , and @xmath31 with charge @xmath21 , in which case the weak and mass eigenstates coincide as long as only one such multiplet is present .",
    "we will actually restrict ourselves to extensions of the sm with only one extra multiplet , as explained in the introduction .",
    "when new fields @xmath32 of charge @xmath27 and non - standard isospin assignments are added to the sm , the resulting physical up - type quark mass eigenstates @xmath33 may in general contain non - zero @xmath32 components , leading for example to a deviation in their couplings to the @xmath8 boson .",
    "constraints on these deviations for the up and charm quarks result from atomic parity violation experiments and the measurement of @xmath34 at lep  @xcite , and are far stronger than for the top quark  @xcite .",
    "singlets  @xcite but to all multiplets with @xmath35 quarks , since in all cases the deviations in the @xmath8 couplings are given by the square of a mixing angle .",
    "] so , it is very reasonable to assume that the only the top quark has sizeable @xmath32 components ( or , in other words , only the top quark `` mixes '' with @xmath35 ) . in this case , the relation between charge @xmath27 weak and mass eigenstates can be parameterised by two @xmath36 unitary matrices @xmath37 , @xmath38 in the down sector , the addition of new fields @xmath39 of charge @xmath28 results in four mass eigenstates @xmath40 . in contrast with the up sector , the measurement of @xmath18 at lep sets constraints on the @xmath41 mixing with the new fields that are stronger than for mixing with the lighter quarks @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "( an exception to this statement is discussed in section  [ sec : fit ] . )",
    "however , one still expects dominant mixing with the @xmath41 quark given the usual yukawa coupling hierarchy in the mass matrices .",
    "this is the case , for instance , in models with fermion partial compositeness .",
    "we will then assume dominant @xmath43 mixing , parameterised by two @xmath36 unitary matrices @xmath44 , @xmath45 the lagrangian for the third generation and heavy quarks in the mass eigenstate basis is given in appendix  [ sec : a ] . to ease the notation , we have dropped the superscripts @xmath15 ( @xmath13 ) of the angles @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) in the models where the mixing occurs only in the up ( down ) sector .",
    "additionally , we use the shorthands @xmath48 , @xmath49 , etc .",
    "this lagrangian contains all the phenomenologically relevant information :    * the modifications of the sm couplings that might show indirect effects of new quarks can be found in the terms that do not contain heavy quark fields ; * the terms relevant for lhc phenomenology heavy quark production and decay are those involving a heavy and a light quark ; * terms with two heavy quarks are relevant for their contribution to oblique corrections .",

    "( [ ec : lmass ] ) and @xmath57 the diagonalised ones .",
    "these general equations are simplified in some particular cases . in the multiplets where either @xmath35 or @xmath58 quarks",
    "are absent , the corresponding @xmath36 mass matrix reduces to the sm quark mass term .",
    "notice also that , in multiplets with both @xmath35 and @xmath58 quarks , the bare mass term is the same for the up and down sectors . for singlets and triplets one has @xmath59 , whereas for doublets @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , for the @xmath61  triplet @xmath62 , and for the @xmath63  triplet , @xmath64 .",
    "factors stem from the relation between the cartesian and spherical coordinates of an irreducible tensor operator of rank 1 ( vector ) . ]",
    "the mixing angles in the left- and right - handed sectors are not independent parameters . from the mass matrix bi - unitary diagonalisation in eq .",
    "( [ ec : diag ] ) one finds ( see also  @xcite ) @xmath65 with the relations ( see also  @xcite ) @xmath66 with @xmath67 , so one of the mixing angles is always dominant , especially in the down sector .",
    "in addition , for the triplets the relations between the off - diagonal yukawa couplings lead to relations between the mixing angles in the up and down sectors , @xmath68 therefore , all multiplets involve a single independent mixing angle parameter , except the @xmath69  doublet , which has two .",
    "the masses of the heavy quarks deviate from @xmath54 due to the non - zero mixing with the sm quarks , and for doublets and triplets the masses of the different components of the multiplet are related , as described in section  [ sec : split ] .",
    "altogether , these relations show that all multiplets except the @xmath69  doublet can be parameterised by a mixing angle , a heavy quark mass and a cp - violating phase that enters few couplings and can be ignored for the observables considered in this paper . in the case of the @xmath69  doublet",
    "there are two independent mixing angles and two cp - violating phases for the up and down sectors .",

    "the contributions to @xmath74 in models with arbitrary numbers of @xmath75 singlets and @xmath69  doublets were given in  @xcite , and generalised for arbitrary vector - like quarks in  @xcite for s and @xcite for t. we have computed the contributions of new quarks to @xmath76 and @xmath77 using the analytical expressions in these references . for the @xmath35 singlet and @xmath78 , @xmath69  doublets ,",
    "these calculations have been cross - checked by implementing the models in feynarts / formcalc  @xcite , which are then used to calculate the gauge boson self - energies .",
    "we take the experimental values , for @xmath79 , @xmath80 with a correlation of 0.88  @xcite .",
    "the largest deviations are found , for all multiplets , in the t parameter .",
    "thus , it is the modification of this quantity which determines the upper limits on mixing angles , as we will see below .",
    "the mixing of the @xmath41 quark with a heavy @xmath58 modifies the @xmath81 coupling at the tree level , whereas @xmath82 mixing modifies it at the one loop level , via the top correction to the effective @xmath83 vertex  @xcite .",
    "we compute this correction in the presence of vector - like quarks using the analytical expressions in  @xcite .",
    "for the sm predictions , we use the values from a fit in  @xcite : @xmath84 these four observables are affected by modifications of the @xmath85 vertex , although @xmath34 only indirectly . writing the effective @xmath85 vertex as @xmath86 and assuming small shifts of the effective couplings @xmath87 , @xmath88 , the deviations in these observables with respect to the sm values can be well approximated by the first - order expressions @xmath89 as experimental measurements , we take  @xcite @xmath90 with the correlation matrix @xmath91 keeping the same ordering of the observables as in eq .",

    "( these limits depend on the heavy quark decay modes , which are different for the different multiplets , see section  [ sec : dec ] for further details and references . ) for multiplets without a @xmath58 quark , the constraints from @xmath92 are more restrictive , whereas for multiplets with a @xmath58 quark where tree - level contributions to the @xmath85 vertex appear the converse holds . for the @xmath69  doublet ,",
    "the constraints on @xmath95 are determined by @xmath92 , but they slightly depend on the value of @xmath96 , which is constrained by @xmath0 .",
    "we thus impose agreement with the two angles at the 95% cl , and present the resulting limits on both @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the mixing for the @xmath97  doublet is less constrained than what might be expected due to the existing discrepancies between the @xmath98 data and the sm predictions .",
    "we examine this case in detail in section  [ sec : fit ] .",
    "vector - like quarks enter the loop diagrams in the amplitudes for higgs production by gluon - gluon fusion and higgs decay into two photons .",
    "however , the minimal extensions considered in this work give small contributions , as it will be explicitly shown below .",
    "one reason is that vector - like quarks decouple when their gauge - invariant masses become large , with fixed yukawa couplings ( in which case their mixing with the sm quarks becomes small ) .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a heavy @xmath35 mixing with the top quark , the contribution turns out to be much smaller than what decoupling suggests , due to a cancellation between the amplitudes with heavy - quark loops and the effect of modified couplings in the loops with the top .",
    "this mechanism has already been shown for a singlet @xmath35 in  @xcite , and for a @xmath99 doublet in  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we extend it to all the seven multiplets .",
    "let us consider the @xmath100 ( or @xmath101 ) and @xmath102 processes in models with one vector - like multiplet .",
    "the contribution of all the quarks of the same charge to the two corresponding amplitudes is proportional to @xmath103 where the sum runs over @xmath104 for @xmath105 and over @xmath106 for @xmath107 , in the mass - eigenstate basis ; the couplings to the higgs @xmath108 are defined in eqs .",
    "( [ ec : ll ] ) and ( [ ec : hh ] ) of appendix  [ sec : a ] , and the function @xmath109 is defined , for instance , in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath109 approaches the infinite mass value of 4/3 pretty fast for @xmath110 larger than @xmath111 , which holds for both @xmath112 and new heavy states .",
    "( the difference between @xmath113 and the asymptotic value for large quark masses is of only 3% . ) thus , in the up sector we can approximate @xmath114 just as in the sm .",
    "the reason for this cancellation can be easily identified . defining the matrix @xmath115 for singlets and triplets",
    "the higgs interactions are given by @xmath116 and for doublets by @xmath117 then , the sum @xmath118 is simply the trace of either the matrix @xmath119 ( singlets and triplets ) or @xmath120 ( doublets ) , which obviously equals unity .    in the down sector , on the other hand , the @xmath41 quark is much lighter and there is essentially no cancellation in the @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) and @xmath102 amplitudes because @xmath121 , much smaller than @xmath122 .",
    "a good approximation is then obtained by using the heavy - quark limit for the @xmath58 quark and neglecting the contribution of the @xmath41 quark .",
    "then , we get the new physics contribution to the amplitudes @xmath123 which is suppressed by the square of the mixing angle , @xmath124 for singlets and triplets and @xmath125 for doublets . we have seen in the previous section that the largest mixing allowed by electroweak tests for the down - type quarks occurs in the case of the @xmath97  doublet . with the largest allowed mixing , @xmath126",
    ", an exact calculation gives an increase in the @xmath100 cross section and @xmath101 partial width of 6.4% with respect to the sm . in @xmath102 , where the @xmath9  boson loop contributes dominantly , the partial width decreases by 0.4% with respect to the sm .",
    "but another effect to account for is the change in the coupling of the higgs to bottom quarks , which modifies at the tree level the decay width @xmath127  @xcite . with the maximal mixing @xmath126 , this partial width is reduced by a 6.4% with respect to its sm value .",
    "since this decay mode gives the bulk of the total width of the higgs , with @xmath128 for @xmath129 gev  @xcite , the branching ratios into other final states are enhanced by an extra 3.8% . in particular , the combined effect in the @xmath101 branching ratio is an increase by 10% with respect to the sm value .",
    "these effects are well below the precision of the current measurements  @xcite , and are likely invisible at the lhc .",
    "but they would be visible at the ilc , where the expected precision in higgs branching ratio measurements is at the few percent level  @xcite .",
    "in particular , deviations in the branching ratios for @xmath101 and @xmath130 would be at the @xmath131 level , given the expected precision @xmath132 of 4.8% and 2.6% , respectively , in their measurement .",
    "finally , note that different conclusions can be drawn in the presence of several different types of vector - like quarks with yukawa couplings connecting them  @xcite or in theories with large non - renormalisable couplings  @xcite .",
