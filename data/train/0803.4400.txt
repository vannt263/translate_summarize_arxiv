    "although undoubtedly successful to describe the critical behavior of @xmath3-like models , _ perturbative _ field theory is still unable to provide a clear , non - controversial understanding of the physics of certain more complex models among which are the famous heisenberg or @xmath4 frustrated magnets ( see @xcite and references therein ) . at the core of the problem",
    "is that different kinds of perturbative approaches , performed up to five- or six - loop order , lead to contradictory results : in dimension @xmath5 , first order phase transitions are predicted within the @xmath1 ( or pseudo-@xmath1)- expansion @xcite whereas a second order transition is found in the fixed - dimension ( fd ) perturbative approaches performed either in the minimal - subtraction ( @xmath6 ) scheme _ without _ @xmath1-expansion @xcite or in the massive scheme @xcite .",
    "in fact , fd results for frustrated magnets are neither supported by experiments nor by monte carlo simulations @xcite ( see however @xcite where a scaling behavior is found ) .",
    "they also disagree with the results obtained from the non - perturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) approach @xcite that predicts ( weak ) first order phase transitions in @xmath5 in agreement with the @xmath1-expansion analysis .    in this article",
    "we shed light on the discrepancies encountered in perturbative approaches to frustrated magnets by showing that the fd approaches lead to dubious predictions as for the critical physics in @xmath5 .",
    "our key - point relies on the very nature of the fd perturbative approach and is easy to grasp already for the simplest  @xmath3  model . in this case , the ( non - resummed ) renormalization group ( rg ) @xmath0-function at @xmath7 loops is a polynomial in its coupling constant @xmath8 of order @xmath9 .",
    "thus , it admits @xmath9 roots @xmath10 , @xmath11 , that are either real or complex . within the @xmath1-expansion ,",
    "when one solves the fixed point ( fp ) equation in successive orders in @xmath12 , the only non - trivial fp retained is by definition such that @xmath13 . on the contrary , in the fd approaches ,",
    "when one directly ( analytically or numerically ) solves the non - linear fp equation at fixed @xmath14 ( fixed @xmath1 ) no real root can be a priori discarded . as a result",
    ", the generic situation is that the number of fps as well as their stability vary with the order @xmath7 : at a given order , there can exist several real and stable fps or none instead of a single one .",
    "this artefact of the fd approach is already known and was first noticed in the massive scheme in @xmath5 @xcite . the way to cope with it",
    "is also known : resumming the perturbative expansion of @xmath15 ( see e.g. @xcite ) is supposed both to restore the non - trivial wilson - fisher fp and to suppress the non - physical or `` spurious '' roots .",
    "this is indeed what occurs for the @xmath3 model for which the fp analysis performed on the resummed @xmath0-function of fd approaches enables to discriminate between physical and `` spurious '' fps .",
    "however this ability of the resummation procedures to eradicate spurious solutions of the fd approach has never been questioned and , _ a fortiori _ , evaluated in the context of more complex models and , in particular , for models with several coupling constants .",
    "we precisely argue , in this article , that the situation is very different for frustrated magnets and probably for several other models . indeed , considering the @xmath0-functions derived at five loops in the @xmath6 scheme and using a standard resummation procedure @xcite",
    "we show that the fp found in @xmath5 without expanding in @xmath1 , although it persists after resummation , is in fact spurious .",
    "our conclusion is based on several facts : ( i ) the critical exponents computed at the fp supposed to control the second order behavior of frustrated magnets display bad convergence properties with the order of computation in the controversial cases of xy and heisenberg spin systems ( ii ) when analyzed with the same fd approach , the field theory relevant to ferromagnetic systems with cubic anisotropy displays a similar fp  having no counterpart within the @xmath1-expansion  in contradiction with its well established critical physics .",
    "the critical exponents computed at this supernumerary fp display the same bad convergence properties with the loop order as in the case of xy and heisenberg frustrated magnets ( iii ) the coordinates @xmath16 of the attractive fp found in the fd approach of frustrated magnets are multivalued functions of @xmath17  @xmath18 being the number of spin components  because of the existence of a topological singularity in the mapping between @xmath17 and the fp coordinates @xmath19 .",
    "this singularity provides strong indications of the existence of pathologies in the rg equations obtained at fixed dimension ( iv ) finally , we provide strong arguments showing that the supernumerary fps found in the frustrated and cubic models survive in the upper critical dimension @xmath2 where they are found to be non - gaussian , a behavior deeply connected with the existence of the above mentioned topological singularity .",
    "being given the present state of knowledge of @xmath20-like theories that are very likely trivial in @xmath2 , this fact confirms the serious doubts on the actual existence of these supernumerary fps .",
    "to investigate the five - loop @xmath0 functions derived in the @xmath6 scheme we have to resum them . before discussing the case of a series of two coupling constants relevant for frustrated magnets or ferromagnetic models with cubic anisotropy we recall , for",
    "the sake of clarity , the main steps needed to resum a series of one coupling constant @xmath8 as well as the underlying hypotheses ( see for a review @xcite ) . let us consider a series @xmath21 where the coefficients @xmath22 are supposed to grow as @xmath23 .",

    "then , using this definition as well as @xmath29=\\int_0^{\\infty } t^{n+b}\\ e^{-t } dt$ ] , one can rewrite @xmath30 }   \\ u^n \\int_0^{\\infty } \\   dt \\ e^{-t}\\ t^{n+b}\\ ] ] and , interchanging summation and integration , one can _ define _ the borel transform of @xmath31 as : @xmath32    in order to perform the integral in ( [ boreltrans ] ) on the whole real positive semi - axis one has to find an analytic continuation of @xmath33 .",
    "several methods can be used , pad approximants for instance .",
    "however , it is generally believed that the use of a conformal mapping is more efficient since it makes use of the convergence properties of the borel sum . under the assumption that all the singularities of @xmath28 lie on the negative real axis and that the borel - leroy sum is analytic in the whole complex plane except for the cut extending from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , one can perform the change of variable : @xmath36 that maps the complex @xmath8-plane cut from @xmath27 to @xmath35 onto the unit circle in the @xmath37-plane such that the singularities of @xmath28 lying on the negative axis now lie on the boundary of the circle @xmath38 .",

    "coincides with that of ( [ series1 ] ) .",
    "one obtains through ( [ borel3 ] ) an analytic continuation of @xmath28 in the whole @xmath8 cut - plane so that a resummed expression of the series @xmath31 can be written : @xmath43^n}\\ .",

    ".    if an infinite number of terms of the series @xmath45 were known , expression ( [ resummation2 ] ) would be independent of the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "however when only a finite number of terms are known , @xmath45 acquires a dependence on them . in principle",
    ", the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are fixed by the large order behavior of the series : @xmath49 which leads to @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xcite while @xmath48 is determined by the strong coupling behavior of the initial series : @xmath52 which can be imposed at any order of the expansion by choosing @xmath53 .",
    "the common assumption is that the above choice of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 improve the convergence of the resummation procedure since it encodes exact results .",
    "let us however emphasize that , often , only @xmath46 is known and that the other parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath47 , are considered either as free ( as for instance in @xcite ) or variational ( for instance in @xcite where @xmath48 is determined by optimizing the apparent convergence of the series ) . in any case , the choice of value of @xmath46 , @xmath48 and @xmath47 must be validated a posteriori by checking that a small change of their value does not yield strong variations of the quantities under study .",
    "such variations would clearly indicate that one has chosen an unstable , parameter - dependent calculation procedure or that one has not computed the quantities under study at a sufficiently high order of perturbation theory to consider them as converged . in the following",
    ", we shall employ this `` stability criterion '' to validate  or invalidate ",
    "the results obtained by means of the fd perturbative approach to frustrated magnets .    in the context of frustrated magnets ,",

    "for @xmath67 the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ landau ] ) is given by @xmath68 while for @xmath69 it is given by a configuration where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are orthogonal with the same norm .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ landau ] ) thus describes a symmetry breaking scheme between a disordered and an ordered phase where the @xmath3 group of rotation is broken down to @xmath72 which is relevant for frustrated magnets ( for details see @xcite for instance ) .",

    "we thus apply the resummation procedure described above without @xmath1-expansion @xcite to the @xmath84 functions , @xmath64 , obtained at five loops in the @xmath6 scheme @xcite . more precisely , as in @xcite , we resum @xmath85 , @xmath64 , instead of @xmath86 , which , in fact , leads to similar results . for the model ( [ landau ] )",

    "for @xmath89 there exists a singularity on the positive real axis so that the series is no longer borel - summable .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , as far as @xmath90 , the singularity of the borel transform closest to the origin is still on the negative axis .",
    "thus , the asymptotic behavior is still correctly taken into account by the conformal mapping and one can , _ a priori _ , trust the resummed results .",
    "note finally that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are typically varied in the ranges @xmath91 $ ] and @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "one finds , in agreement with @xcite , that there exists a curve ( parametrized by @xmath73 or its reciprocal @xmath93 ) such that for @xmath94 a stable fp @xmath79 governs the critical properties of the system .",

    "this situation , put together with the fact , already underlined in the introduction , that the fd approach a priori displays spurious fps , lead us to strongly question the validity of the results obtained at fd and , in particular , the existence of genuine fps in @xmath5 for @xmath105 .     obtained within the @xmath6 scheme with @xmath1-expansion ( @xmath98 ) , without @xmath1-expansion ( @xmath106 ) and the nprg approach ( @xmath96 ) .",

    "we focus on the ( real part of the ) correction to scaling exponent @xmath110 at the fp @xmath111 which rules its stability : for re(@xmath112 the fp is stable and for re(@xmath113 it is unstable . within the fd approach , one finds in @xmath5 for @xmath114 that @xmath111 is a focus , that is @xmath110 is complex at this fp ( the flow spirals around it ) . in practice ,",
    "following @xcite , we optimize @xmath115 by first choosing @xmath48 such that @xmath116 is minimal .",

    "note that the typical error bars obtained for the ising model with the same methodology at the same orders are much less than 1@xmath123 .     for @xmath119 as a function of @xmath47 at four ( curves on the left ) and five ( curves on the right ) loops for @xmath124 for the frustrated model .",

    "moreover , considering the values of @xmath48 and @xmath47 that minimize the difference @xmath126 one observes a bad `` convergence '' : the errors bar on the critical exponents are now of order @xmath127 and thus far larger than in the case @xmath119 .",
    "an even worse behavior is obtained in the xy case .    from these analyses",
    "one gets striking indications of drastically different convergence properties for the @xmath119 and @xmath125 cases .",
    "this suggests a qualitative difference between the corresponding fps . to characterize more precisely this difference",
    "let us now study the cubic model along the same lines .     for @xmath125 as a function of @xmath47 at five ( upper curves ) and four ( lower curves ) loops for @xmath124 for the frustrated model .",

    "the presence of this fp , if taken seriously , would have important physical consequences since it would correspond to a second order phase transition with a new universality class . however no such transition has ever been reported . on the contrary , a first order behaviour for all values of @xmath18 larger than @xmath138",
    "is found within perturbative @xcite or non - perturbative @xcite field theoretical analysis as well as numerical simulations @xcite in related systems ( four - state antiferromagnetic potts model ) .",

    "it is also interesting to consider the values of @xmath48 and @xmath47 that minimizes the difference @xmath126 .",
    "from there , one finds error bars for @xmath110 of order @xmath155 , i.e. of the _ same _ order of magnitude as the one found in the @xmath125 frustrated case .",
    "being given the fact that the fp @xmath149 is clearly an artefact of the fd analysis , our study suggests that the lack of convergence of @xmath117 _ characterizes _ the behavior at a spurious fp .",
    "thus , coming back on the frustrated case one is naturally led to the conclusion that the fps @xmath156 found in @xmath5 and @xmath105 should also be interpreted as spurious fps , as artefacts of the fd analysis . in order to confirm this statement",
    "we now examine another characteristic feature of the set of @xmath156 fps considered as functions of @xmath14 and @xmath18 .",
    "we now display a specific feature of the rg flow of frustrated magnets analyzed within the fd approach that provides another strong indication of the problematic character of this approach .",
    "let us consider the coordinates @xmath158 of the fp @xmath156 as functions of @xmath14 and @xmath18 : @xmath159 , @xmath64 .",
    "these functions are the roots of the @xmath0-functions of the couplings @xmath54 and @xmath55 obtained in the fd approach and resummed according to the scheme sketched above , eq.([resummation ] ) : @xmath160 the resummed @xmath0-functions are smooth functions of @xmath14 and @xmath18 showing no particular feature for @xmath161 and @xmath162 . however , as we now show , the functions @xmath159 , @xmath64 exhibit a non - trivial behavior as @xmath14 and @xmath18 are varied continuously around the point labelled @xmath157 in fig.[courbes_ncd ] .",
    "let us first give , in fig.[focuslocus ] , the precise definition of the curve @xmath73 in the fd approach .",
    "this curve is made of two parts : the first one , labelled ( i ) , corresponds to the part of the curve above @xmath157 while the second one , labelled ( ii ) , corresponds to the part below @xmath157 .",
    "( i ) is defined as the line in the @xmath17 plane above which there exist two non - trivial _ locus _ fp ( that is having real exponents @xmath110 ) , one stable @xmath156 and one unstable @xmath163 , and below which there exists none .",
    "we recall the mechanism of disappearance of these fps : when _ at fixed dimension @xmath14 _ , @xmath18 is decreased from large values down to @xmath82 the two fps @xmath156 and @xmath163 get closer and closer from each other and finally collapse right on ( i ) . for @xmath18 below @xmath73 ,",
    "the coordinates @xmath164 and @xmath165 become complex and there is no longer any non - trivial fp with real coordinates .",
    "thus , the part ( i ) of the curve @xmath73 corresponds to the region where the speed of the rg flow between @xmath156 and @xmath163 vanishes .",
    "the same behavior is observed in other ( @xmath1-expansion and nprg ) approaches and the numerical values of @xmath73 in the corresponding part of the curve are very close when calculated by different approches ( c.f .",
    "fig.[courbes_ncd ] ) .     within the @xmath6 scheme without @xmath1-expansion .",
    "the part ( i ) of the curve @xmath166 corresponds to a boundary between a region where , at a given dimension @xmath14 there exists a stable locus fp at large @xmath18 and no fp at small @xmath18 .",
    "the part ( ii ) of the curve @xmath166 corresponds to a boundary between a region where at fixed @xmath18 there exists an attractive focus fp for @xmath167 and a repulsive focus for @xmath168 .",
    "finally the line ( f ) is defined as follow : above ( f ) , @xmath156 is a locus fp ( @xmath169 and @xmath170 are both real ) and below ( f ) , it is a focus ( @xmath169 and @xmath171 are complex ) . ]    as usual , the speed of the rg flow around a fp can be obtained by linearizing the flow equations at this point .",
    "it is thus governed by the two eigenvalues of the `` stability '' matrix @xmath172 that provide the speeds of the rg flow in its two eigendirections at the fp considered .",
    "these eigenvalues define the two critical exponents @xmath169 and @xmath170 governing the corrections to scaling . the equation of the part ( i ) of @xmath73 is thus given by : @xmath173 where @xmath169 is the eigenvalue of @xmath133 corresponding to the eigendirection of the flow joining @xmath156 to @xmath163 .",
    "now , when moving _ on _ the line @xmath73 towards @xmath157 one finds that @xmath170 decreases and eventually vanishes .",
    "one thus defines the point @xmath157 by : @xmath174 thus , right at @xmath157 , @xmath175 and , with the choice of parameters @xmath176 one finds that at @xmath157 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "thus , @xmath157 is just outside  but not far of  the region of borel - summability .",
    "note also that , since its coordinates verify @xmath180 , @xmath157 is still in the region where the resummed results are trustable .",
    "in fact , the point @xmath157 is also a special point in the sense that it is the endpoint of another line , labelled @xmath181 on fig.[focuslocus ] which is such that below @xmath181 , the two exponents @xmath182 s acquire an imaginary part and are complex conjugates : @xmath183 .",
    "this means that , below @xmath181 , the fps become focuses , either attractive or repulsive .",
    "this is in particular the case of the fp @xmath156 found in @xcite in @xmath5 . from now on we concentrate on the fp @xmath156 since the coordinates of @xmath163 rapidly grow and go outside the region of borel summability .",
    "note that the part of ( f ) shown on fig.[focuslocus ] lies inside the region of borel summability and thus , within the fd approach , is supposed to be well under control .",
    "we now define the part ( ii ) of the curve @xmath73 as the line separating the region where @xmath156 is an _ attractive _ focus fp ( for @xmath94 ) and the region where it is a _ repulsive _ focus fp ( for @xmath184 ) .",
    "occurs as follows . for @xmath94 and @xmath185 and sufficiently close to ( ii ) , @xmath156 is a focus and is attractive inside a basin of attraction which is a limit cycle for the rg flow .",
    "this limit cycle is repulsive : inside it the rg flow converges to @xmath156 , outside the rg flow diverges .",
    "when , at fixed @xmath18 , the dimension @xmath14 is increased this limit cycle shrinks and becomes a point on ( ii ) .",
    "when @xmath14 is further increased , the limit cycle re - appears but now it is attractive and @xmath156 becomes a repulsive focus fp .",
    "] thus , by definition , ( ii ) is the line on which the real part of the @xmath182 s vanishes : @xmath186 but it is _ no longer _ a line where @xmath156 collapses with another fp and disappears .",
    "it is remarkable that within the fd approach , there exists a line ( the part ( ii ) of the curve @xmath73 ) that has _ no counterpart _ in other approches .",
    "contrary to what occurs above , the coordinates @xmath164 and @xmath187 of @xmath156 on the line ( ii ) are , for a large part of ( ii ) , far outside the region of borel summability .",
    "it is thus not possible to compute accurately the location of ( ii ) . we , however , emphasize that only the existence of ( ii ) is necessary for the validity of our arguments , not its precise determination . as for the existence of this part ( ii ) of the curve @xmath73",
    ", it is an unavoidable consequence of the existence of @xmath157 which is supposed to be under control _ within the perturbative fd approach_. thus , either @xmath157 really exists and part ( ii ) of @xmath73 also exists  with a shape that could be somewhat different of the one drawn on fig.[focuslocus ]  or it does not exist and neither does @xmath157 . in this second case , this would mean that the _ whole _ resummation scheme is questionable at least for sufficiently low @xmath14 and @xmath18 ( typically @xmath188 and @xmath114 ) .",
    "we argue in the following that this is very probably what occurs .",
    "let us now show on fig.[paths ] that there exists a very non - trivial property of the rg flow which is a consequence of the existence of @xmath157 .",
    "the idea is to follow continuously the coordinates of the fp @xmath156 along a path encircling @xmath157 , path a in fig.[paths ] for instance .",
    "we start , for instance at @xmath189 go to @xmath190 then to @xmath191 then to @xmath192 and finally go back to @xmath189 .",
    "the surprising fact is that by making a trip along such a closed path , the coordinates @xmath193 of @xmath156 do not go back to their original value .",
    "this is specific to @xmath157 since along any closed path that does not encircle this point  path b in fig.[paths ] for instance  the coordinates @xmath158 of @xmath156 always go back to their original values .",
    "let us emphasize here that such a path can well cross part ( i ) of the curve @xmath73 as path b does in fig.[paths ] . in this case , @xmath156 has complex coordinates on the part of the path which is below ( i ) , but as the path crosses again ( i ) the coordinates become real again and go back finally to their original values .",
    "all this makes @xmath157 a topological singularity of the functions @xmath194 and @xmath195",
    ".     plane .",
    "path a encloses @xmath157 and is such that the coordinates of the fp @xmath156 do not go back to their original values after a trip along this path at variance with path b. ]    let us remark at this stage that , before having drawn any conclusion from the existence of a topological singularity , one faces a very unusual property of the mapping from the plane @xmath196 to the fp coupling constants space @xmath193 which makes multivalued the functions @xmath197 and @xmath198 . while one can not a priori discard the possibility of such a behavior of the functions @xmath197 and @xmath198 , it is tempting to attribute it to the coexistence at a given @xmath17 of fps that are identical to those found within the @xmath12 expansion and fps that are artefacts of the fd approach .",
    "let us now draw the full consequences of the striking behavior described above .",
    "we now present our last argument in favor of the spurious character of the fps obtained within the fd approach for small @xmath14 and @xmath18 .",
    "it is based , to a large extent , on the existence of the singularity @xmath157 in the @xmath16 plane that leads to a striking property of the field theory describing frustrated magnets .",
    "let us first recall some basic features about the description of the long distance physics of a lattice system by a continuous field theory .",
    "the most important ingredient in this construction is the choice of a low - energy effective hamiltonian in terms of the order parameter @xmath199 .",
    "this choice implies the selection of a finite number of terms  the @xmath200 and @xmath20 terms for second order phase transitions  among the infinite number of operators obtained in the hubbard - stratonovitch derivation of the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "this selection of the most relevant terms fully relies on the existence of an upper critical dimension where the theory is _ perturbatively _ infrared free , _",
    "i.e. _ controlled by the gaussian fp .",
    "indeed , it is only under this condition that power - counting makes sense since it is based on the engineering dimension of the field that neglects fluctuations .",
    "perturbation theory can then be used since , by definition , it consists in an expansion around the gaussian theory .",
    "also , the perturbative results obtained in this way are reliable as long as the ( infrared attractive ) fp found this way ( i ) is connected to the gaussian by the rg flow , ( ii ) lies in the borel - summability region ( iii ) is not too far from the gaussian fp so that calculations performed at @xmath7 loops lead to converged results .",
    "let us indicate that because of point ( i ) above , _ if _ the theory is trivial in @xmath2 , it is very probable that any non - trivial fp identified in @xmath5 , once followed continuously from @xmath5 to @xmath2 , becomes gaussian in this dimension .",
    "this is in particular what underlies the validity of the @xmath12 expansion .",
    "let us now briefly discuss the question of triviality of scalar theories in @xmath2 and the ensuing consequences for their perturbative analysis in any dimension below 4 .",
    "we first emphasize that there is no rigorous proof of the triviality of scalar theories in @xmath2 . however",
    "( i ) there is a large body of evidences of triviality at least for the @xmath3 models and in particular for the ising model ( ii ) it is very likely that even if the scalar models were non - trivial in @xmath2 , perturbation theories would not be able to reach the corresponding fp @xcite .",
    "thus , the most natural hypothesis is that the @xmath201 theory is also trivial in @xmath2 .",
    "an ever weaker hypothesis , that we make and use in the following , is that this is the case when it is analyzed perturbatively .",
    "all previous considerations and assumptions lead us to conclude that , very probably , any physical fp found _ perturbatively _ in any dimension must be gaussian when followed continuously in @xmath2 .",
    "let us notice that a non - perturbative approach , performed by some of the present authors @xcite on the @xmath201 theory did not lead to any non - trivial fp in @xmath2 which sustains our triviality hypotheses in @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , according to our hypotheses , a practical way to check whether a fp found at a given dimension , @xmath5 for instance , is a genuine fp or is just an artefact of perturbation theory is to follow it by continuity up to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "if the fp survives as a non - gaussian fp at this dimension we consider it as spurious .",
    "it is important to realize that our criterion does not exclude fp in @xmath5 whose coordinates become complex between @xmath5 to @xmath2 as far as they vanish in @xmath2 .",
    "this is in particular the case for all fps associated to the paths with fixed @xmath18 in the @xmath17 plane that cross ( i ) above @xmath157 .",
    "let us apply this criterion to analyze the fps @xmath149 and @xmath156 that appear in the fd analysis of the cubic and frustrated models .",
    "we present our results in fig.[frustre3 ] where we have displayed the coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath164 associated with these fps as functions of @xmath14 at fixed @xmath18 .",
    "manifestly , they both survive everywhere above @xmath5 and are _ not _ gaussian in @xmath2 . in the cubic case , this is true for all values of @xmath18 for which @xmath149 exists . in the frustrated case",
    ", this is true for @xmath18 typically below 7 . according to our criterion , @xmath149 is",
    ", as expected , always found to be spurious while @xmath156 is spurious only for @xmath114 .",
    "we thus conclude , in the frustrated case , that the fps found in @xmath5 for @xmath105 are spurious .",
    "coordinate of the fp @xmath149 of the cubic model ( @xmath202 , upper curve ) and the @xmath164 coordinate of the fp @xmath156 of the frustrated model ( @xmath125 , lower curve ) as functions of @xmath14 . ]",
    "let us emphasize that when @xmath14 approaches 4 the coordinates of the fps @xmath149 and @xmath156 for @xmath114 become large and do no longer belong to the region of borel - summability so that they can not be determined accurately as it is the case of part ( ii ) of the curve @xmath73 .",
    "one could thus naively conclude that it is not possible to safely decide whether these fps are or are not gaussian in @xmath2 .",
    "this is actually not the case for at least two reasons .",
    "first , if these fps _ were _ gaussian in @xmath2 , their coordinates just below this dimension would be extremely small and their existence as gaussian fps in @xmath2 could be safely established within perturbation theory even without any resummation procedure . since for @xmath14 just below 4 no such fps close to the gaussian are found in perturbation theory , their non - gaussian character is doubtless in @xmath2 .",
    "second , in the frustrated case , the non - gaussian character of the @xmath156 fp is a clear consequence of the existence of ( ii ) which , itself , relies on the existence of the singularity @xmath157 . indeed , following a fp @xmath156 along a path starting in @xmath5 , going to @xmath2 and crossing @xmath203 _ above _ @xmath157 ,",
    "the coordinates of @xmath156 become complex in @xmath204 and both the real and the imaginary parts of @xmath205 and @xmath206 go to zero for @xmath2 where it is thus a gaussian fp .",
    "if , on the contrary , the path crosses @xmath203 _ below _",
    "@xmath157 , @xmath156 changes from a stable focus to an unstable one at @xmath204 and does not go to the gaussian in @xmath2 .",
    "the singularity @xmath157 is therefore responsible for the non - gaussian character of @xmath156 in @xmath2 .",
    "thus , even if the coordinates of @xmath156 for @xmath114 become large for @xmath14 close to 4 , its non - gaussian character in this dimension makes no doubt .",
    "note finally that it is tempting to follow this fp @xmath156 _ above _ @xmath2 where there exist rigorous proofs of the triviality of the scalar @xmath20 field theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , as it is suggested by fig.[frustre3 ] , the fp @xmath156 apparently survives at finite distance above d=4 .",
    "however this last fact must be taken with great caution since @xmath156 is now deeply out of the region of borel - summability and one has no longer any control of where the fp really lies .",
    "it appears from our study that the fps @xmath156 identified in the fd approach are very likely spurious .",
    "the transition in frustrated magnets should thus be of  possibly weak  first order in agreement with nprg and @xmath1-expansion approaches .",
    "it remains to explain the failure in the resummation procedure used in the fd approach , eq.([resummation ] ) .",
    "as already emphasized this procedure relies on the hypothesis that resumming with respect to @xmath54 , keeping a polynomial structure in @xmath55 , is sufficient .",
    "alternatively , a resummation of the series with respect to the _ two _ coupling constants could be required to obtain reliable results ( see for instance @xcite for the randomly diluted ising model ) . postponing these considerations for a future publication",
    "@xcite we assume that the use of eq.([resummation ] ) as such is justified .",
    "then , a possible origin of the failure in the resummation procedure could be that the series considered are not known at large enough order to reach the asymptotic behavior . in this case",
    "there would be no reason to fix the parameter @xmath46 at its asymptotic value @xmath107 and one should have to vary it as @xmath47 and @xmath48 to optimize the results @xcite .",
    "we display in fig.[nc ] the curves @xmath203 for different values of @xmath46 .",
    "the part corresponding to large values of @xmath207 , typically for @xmath208 , is almost insensitive to the variations of @xmath46 whereas this is clearly not the case for smaller values of @xmath207 . in particular , for sufficiently large values of @xmath46 , typically @xmath209 , the s - like part is pushed below @xmath5 so that @xmath99 , @xmath203 and @xmath100 are then compatible everywhere for @xmath210 .",
    "let us also notice in this respect that , for @xmath211 , the shape of the curve @xmath203 is even compatible with the results obtained in the massive scheme in @xmath5 in which one finds fps for all values of @xmath18 but in the range @xmath212 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the two fd methods  massive scheme in @xmath5 and @xmath6 without @xmath1-expansion  are in fact compatible but suffer from the same problems of convergence .",
    "thus , under our hypothesis , all qualitative differences between the different approaches disappear , so that the problem would boil down to a question of order of computation .     for different values of the parameter @xmath46 ( from right to left @xmath213 ) and the curve @xmath214 . the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 are @xmath108 and @xmath109",
    "the parts of the curves below the black dots correspond to a regime of borel non - summability . ]",
    "finally note that our present considerations surely pertains to the case of frustrated magnets in @xmath215 @xcite .",
    "indeed we have checked that the fp found in @xmath215 is continuously related to the fp @xmath156 in @xmath5 which makes its existence doubtful .",
    "our conclusions could also apply in other situations where fps that have no counterpart in the @xmath1-expansion are found , as it is the case , for instance , in qcd at finite temperature @xcite .",
