    "magnetism of matter in thermal equilibrium is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon .",
    "for conventional metals one usually identifies two contributions : a paramagnetic one -pauli- due to the magnetic moment of the spin , and a diamagnetic one -landau- due to the orbital motion of electrons .",
    "@xcite in the free electron case , the magnitude of the spin contribution is larger by a factor of three compared with the orbital contribution so that the system exhibits paramagnetism .",
    "however , orbital magnetism depends sensitively on details of the electronic structure , and sometimes deviates strongly from conventional landau diamagnetism .",
    "for instance , narrow gap materials such as bismuth  @xcite and graphene  @xcite exhibit considerably enhanced diamagnetism . also , the chirality imposed on electronic states by spin - orbit coupling leads to the appearance of new states of matter with peculiar magnetic responses .",
    "for example , it has recently been shown experimentally that some iridate compounds  @xcite possess strong orbital magnetism that dominates over spin paramagnetism .    the modern theory of orbital magnetization @xcite focuses on a crystalline system of independent electrons in a state that breaks time - reversal symmetry .",
    "in this theory , the orbital magnetization comes from the orbital motion of carriers and also from a correction due to the berry curvature .",
    "it has become important to generalize this modern theory of orbital magnetization to include the effect of interactions .",
    "indeed , the first principles application of the theory for ferromagnetic transition metals have shown that this theory underestimates the orbital magnetization .",
    "@xcite it is reasonable to expect that interactions can explain this discrepancy .",
    "also , interactions renormalize the electronic structure of the system , in some cases so drastically that they cause a phase transition .",
    "interactions can therefore modify both contributions to the orbital magnetization .    here",
    "we derive a formula for the orbital magnetization of an interacting system in terms of the fully interacting green function and of the corresponding vertex functions .",
    "the proposed formalism can be used for systems with arbitrary band topology along with any method capable of calculating the interacting green function , such as _ gw _ or dmft . as a simple example",
    ", we apply this formula to the kane - mele - hubbard ( kmh ) model  @xcite in the presence of an exchange magnetic field that acts on spins only to break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "we allow for a chiral symmetry breaking perturbation in the kmh so that we can study both the correlated topological insulating phase and the trivial insulating phase .",
    "the thermodynamic definition of the orbital magnetization density at zero temperature is , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the grand potential per unit volume of the system , @xmath2 is a magnetic field and the derivative is evaluated at constant electron density . to focus on the orbital contribution , we exclude the zeeman energy . the full algebraic derivation is given in appendix a. but it is in fact simple to understand the procedure and final result .",
    "one can not take directly the derivative with respect to a uniform magnetic field since , fundamentally , @xmath1 is a function of a vector potential that must depend on position ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , going to fourier space , one must expand @xmath1 in powers of @xmath3 and @xmath4 and keep the part of the derivative that is antisymmetric under exchange of the cartesian directions @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "computing @xmath7 with @xmath8 the fully antisymmetric levi - civita tensor , we thus obtain @xmath9 . the expression for @xmath1 in presence of the gauge field @xmath10 involves an energy vertex multiplied by a dressed green function that depends on two wave vector indices , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , since we do not have translational invariance ( see eq .",
