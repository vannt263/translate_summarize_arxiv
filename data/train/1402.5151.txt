    "galaxy interactions , especially major mergers , are responsible for some of the most dramatic activity seen in galaxies . in the canonical view , interactions stimulate star formation , thereby powering the high infrared ( ir ) luminosities often seen in such systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : driving gas inflows to the central regions , resulting in heightened activity of the central supermassive black hole and local starburst activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and leading to significant morphological distortions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these activities , however , occur over timescales that make detecting evolution in individual systems or tracing the corresponding development in physical processes impossible .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of interacting galaxies provide a means of probing the interaction sequence and bypassing the problem of the timescales .    a crucial test of any simulation is its ability to reproduce observations .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy interactions have primarily been tested in two ways : by how well they reproduce the ( optical ) morphological distortions seen in such systems , and by how closely their simulated emission matches that of real systems .",
    "some simulations are designed to reproduce specific systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while others compare specific properties , such as colors , of a suite of simulations to observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite were the first to systematically model the morphologies of interacting galaxies .",
    "they used simple simulations of massless particles around two masses to reproduce the tails and bridges seen in systems like the m51 , the mice ( ngc4676 ) and the antennae ( ngc4038/4039 ) .",
    "much more recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also barnes 2011 ) developed identikit , a modeling tool that uses n - body simulations to reproduce the morphology and kinematics of tidal tails in interacting systems .",
    "@xcite demonstrated identikit s ability to reproduce the morphology and h i kinematics of ngc5257/5258 , the mice , the antennae , and ngc2623 and to estimate the time since the first pericenter passage and until coalescence .",
    "morphological analyses like these inherently suffer from an obvious bias : simulations trace mass but observations trace light . better comparisons propagate light from the simulated luminous matter to a fiducial observer .",
    "sunrise@xcite accomplishes exactly that .",
    "it is a radiative transfer code that propagates the emission of simulated stars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) through a dusty interstellar medium ( ism ) generated by the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "it is an ideal tool for creating simulated spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for comparison to photometry .",
    "for example , @xcite simulated the seds of seven isolated galaxies , which they compared to spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ; * ? ? ? * ) galaxies from @xcite .",
    "the @xcite simulations did not cover all of the parameter space spanned by sings ; nonetheless , good matches from the sings sample were found for each of the simulated galaxies , demonstrating the ability of sunriseto produce realistic galaxy seds . @xcite combined analyses of the morphology and emission , by creating a set of hydrodynamic simulations to reproduce the morphology of the antennae and performing radiative transfer to determine the predicted emission in the herschel space observatory s photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ) bands .",
    "this paper is the first systematic comparison of the observed and simulated seds spanning the range from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the far - ir ( fir ) for interacting galaxies .",
    "@xcite determined which of the sings galaxies were best reproduced by the seds of their simulated isolated spiral galaxies .",
    "our study takes a related but different approach : we do not create simulations aimed at specifically reproducing our observed interactions ; rather , we produce a range of simulated interactions and examine how realistically they reproduce observed systems , determine which of the simulated seds best reproduce the observed seds of interacting systems , and identify the simulation properties , such as stellar mass , sfr , or interaction stage , common to the set .    at high redshifts , morphological details become impossible to resolve and so estimates of interaction stage based on morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) become unworkable .",
    "a spectral marker for interaction stage would be a powerful tool for examining how interactions at high redshift compare to local interactions .",
    "therefore , we ask whether there is an unambiguous signature of the interaction stage in the sed . in this paper , we compare the seds of a suite of simulations of interacting and isolated spiral galaxies to the seds of 31 interacting galaxies to examine the simulation properties able to reproduce the sed of an observed system . a clear extension of our study is to test whether there is a signature of the morphology in the sed by finding common morphology either within the set of best matches or between the matches and the observation .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "we summarize our sample selection and the photometry in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we describe the hydrodynamic simulations and the radiative transfer done in post - processing .",
    "we discuss our matching methodology and the best - matched seds in section 4 .",
    "section 5 contains a discussion of the origins of the best- and worst - matched seds , a comparison between the stellar and dust masses , dust luminosity , star formation rate ( sfr ) , specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) of the observed systems and the best - matched simulated counterparts , an analysis of the effectiveness of morphology - based interaction stage classification scheme , and an examination of the evolution of seds in major mergers .",
    "we summarize our results in section 6 .",
    "our sample and observations are described in detail in ( * ? ? ?",

    "we summarize the selection criteria for our galaxies and briefly describe the photometry and the fitting process that provides the stellar masses , dust masses and temperatures , sfr , and ssfr that we will compare to the simulations .",

    "sunrisecalculates an sed per pixel , thereby yielding results analogous to integral field unit spectrography ; however for this work , we only utilized integrated photometry .",
    "seven viewing angles distributed isotropically in solid angle were used . whereas the conditions of the hydrodynamic simulations are saved at 10myr , the seds are typically calculated with sunriseat 100myr intervals .",
    "however , during the most active periods of the strongest interactions ( i.e. , when the seds vary rapidly in time ) , seds were calculated at 10myr or 20myr intervals .",
    "for the simulations , the sub - resolution structure of the dust is a significant  perhaps the most significant  uncertainty in the radiative transfer calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when performing the radiative transfer through the dust in a simulation s ism , sunrisehas two options for treating the sub - resolution dust structure : either the dust associated with the cold clouds in the @xcite sub - resolution model is ignored ( @xmath26 ; we refer to this as the ` default ism ' or ` dism ' ) or the total dust mass is used ( @xmath27 ; we refer to this as the ` alternate ism ' or ` aism ' ) . in either case , to calculate the optical depth across a grid cell , sunriseassumes that the dust mass ( @xmath28 ) is distributed uniformly throughout the grid cell .",
    "thus , the difference between the two ism treatments is simply that in the dism case , photons are propagated through less dust in each grid cell than in the aism case . the effect of the alternative treatment varies between grid cells because the fraction of ism contained in cold clouds depends on local ism conditions . for each gadget-3simulation , we performed two sunriseruns , one with each ism model .",
    "comparisons between the simulated and observed seds were done separately for each set , and we examined the effect of the ism treatment on the selection of the best matches .",

    "for each of these angles , the azimuthal angle is also uniformly sampled , except at the north pole where all azimuthal viewing angles are equivalent . ] and run with both assumptions regarding the sub - resolution dust structure .",
    "thus , our sed library contains a total of almost 12,000seds .",
    "radiative transfer codes inherently make assumptions about the material through which photons are propagated and the source of those photons .",
    "for example , in our sunriseruns , we assumed mw dust composition rather than large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) dust compositions . in order to assess the uncertainty in the simulated sed due to the dust treatment , we examine six sunriseruns calculated for an equal - mass spiral - spiral merger similar to our simulated interactions ( the ` weakly obscured ' simulation of @xcite ) , for which the hydrodynamic inputs remain constant but the assumptions used for the radiative transfer calculations were varied .",
    "specifically , we varied the treatment of the sub - resolution dust structure , used two alternate dust models ( lmc and smc dust rather than the default mw model ) , used the dl07 dust emission templates which include the effects of stochastically heated very small grains instead of performing radiative transfer , and disabled the agn emission .",
    "figure [ sunrise ] ( left ) shows seds at five different times during the interaction for the six different models .",
    "the black lne is the fiducial model .",
    "figure [ sunrise ] ( right ) shows the fractional difference between the fiducial model and each test model .",
    "as we noted , sunrisehas two possibilities for the treatment of the multiple ism phases .",
    "the black fiducial model uses the default ism treatment in which dense clumps are ignored .",
    "the red line in figure [ sunrise ] shows the sed derived when the alternative ism methodology is employed and radiative transfer is calculated using the total dust content of a grid cell .",
    "the alternate ism model has two main effects on the sed : colder dust temperatures ( and hence enhanced emission in the spire bands ) and increased absorption in the optical and uv .    the green and yellow lines in figure [ sunrise ] show the seds that result with the assumption of lmc and smc dust .",
    "use of the smc dust model results in significantly reduced nuv absorption ( because of the lack of the 2175   feature in the smc extinction curve ) and weaker pah features in the mir ( because of the reduced abundance of carbonaceous grains in the smc dust model compared with the mw and lmc models ) .",
    "the results when the lmc dust model is used differ significantly less from the results for the mw model , but the attenuation in the uv - optical  and thus the re - emission in the ir  is somewhat less than in the default case .",
    "the results when the agn emission is not included are denoted with cyan lines .",
    "the strongest effect is that compared with the default case the emission in the mir at @xmath3010@xmath8 m is reduced .",
    "this effect only becomes apparent in the later interaction stages when the agn contribution to the sed is non - negligible .",
    "figure [ stdev_sunrise ] quantifies how sensitive each wavelength band ( from the uv to the fir ) is to the variations in the radiative transfer modeling .",
    "it elaborates on figure [ sunrise ] ( right panels ) which depicts that effect for a single snapshot and viewing angle for each of the five alternative models .",
    "each line in figure [ stdev_sunrise ] shows the typical variation at a given snapshot , given by the median of @xmath31 over all test models @xmath32 and viewing angles @xmath33 . to show the evolution of this uncertainty over the course the simulation ,",

    "the variation with respect to the fiducial model is typically @xmath3020% and 30@xmath340% , respectively .",
    "the mir is dominated by the reduced pah emission for the smc dust model due to the decreased abundance of carbonaceous grains and the increased emission from stochastically heated grains when the dl07 templates are used . the significantly lower absorption in the nuv for the smc model results in the high standard deviation around 0.2 - 0.3@xmath8 m .",
    "the standard deviation in the fir is dominated by the assumption regarding the sub - resolution dust clumpiness and is typically at least 40%.the fir variation also exhibits the most evolution with time .",
    "its standard deviation rises from 40% to @xmath3080% during first passage and to 100% during coalescence . the median uncertainty taken over all the snapshots and over",
    "the whole sed is 30% for a single viewing angle and 35% overall .",
    "we seek to determine whether the sed of an observed system is well - matched by one or more simulated seds , and , if there are any good matches , whether they come from a small region of the simulation parameter space ( and thus the matching procedure yields a non - degenerate ` fit ' ) .",
    "we therefore chose to do a brute - force evaluation of all simulated seds with the sed of each interacting system by means of the @xmath34 statistic between each pair of simulated and observed seds :    @xmath35    as discussed in section 3.2 , there is significant uncertainty in the models , which is primarily due to uncertainties regarding the dust properties and the need to treat sub - resolution dust structure in the simulations in a simplified manner .",
    "based on the analysis described in section 3.2.1 , we determined that a uncertainty of 30% realistically represented our confidence in the simulated seds .",
    "the uncertainty in the observed photometry is primarily driven by the calibration uncertainty of the instruments , which is typically around 10% .",
    "therefore , the statistic we use to compare the observed and the model seds is :    @xmath36      in figure [ chi_by_model ] , we show the reduced @xmath34 value for each pairing of an observed and simulated sed ordered by simulation .",
    "the horizontal lines in this figure identify the sets of best matching simulated seds that we will examine for trends : those within @xmath37 and within @xmath38 of the minimum @xmath34 for each observed system .",
    "this selection was done separately for the dism and aism seds .",
    "the smaller set of matches on average has 9 matches per observed pair for the dism seds and 7 matches for the aism seds .",
    "the larger set of matches provides a sense of the stability of the trends if we relax our definition of the best matches , and on average has 19 and 13 matches per observed pair for the dism and aism seds respectively .",
    "we also use the match criterion to select the worst matches .",
    "we select the set for each interaction that cover 10% of the @xmath34 range and have the largest @xmath34 values , typically @xmath301000 simulated seds .    for each observed system , we also determine the mean and median @xmath39 as a function of simulation , snapshot , and viewing angle , to determine whether broad areas of parameter space can be deemed unlikely to reproduce the observed sed for each set of sunriseruns .",
    "we describe the trends in the matches and in these functions in section 5.1 .      in figure [ int_fits ] , we plot the best - matched simulated seds for each interaction overlaid with the observed photometry .",
    "typically , the observed systems can be matched reasonably well by one or more of the simulated seds , although the ` fits ' would not always be considered acceptable in a statistical sense .",
    "the success of the simulated seds at reproducing those of the observed systems is encouraging because we are self - consistently ` forward - modeling ' the seds using dust radiative transfer performed on hydrodynamical simulations and not tuning any parameters .",
    "we stress that because we do not allow the normalization of the simulated seds to be free ( i.e. , we are not using them as templates that can be arbitrarily rescaled ) , the seds are intimately tied to the physical parameters of the simulations .",
    "the only manner in which we can modify the outcome of the fitting procedure is by performing additional simulations or by varying the assumptions in the hydrodynamical simulations and radiative transfer . here",
    ", we have done the latter for the most significant uncertainty in the radiative transfer calculations , the sub - resolution dust structure , and we will discuss the effects of varying this assumption below .",
    "several systems show interesting behavior .",
    "some of our most evolved systems ( e.g. ngc4038/4039 , and ngc5394/5395 ) have better overall matched seds from the aism set than from the dism set , although their photometry hints at the presence of typically cooler dust than found in the simulations as their fir emission peaks at longer wavelengths .",
    "these systems also typically have excess absorption in the uv relative to the observed photometry , and have very few matches . in systems where the dism set yields better overall matches ( e.g. ngc3226/3227 , ngc3690/ic694 )",
    ", the aism model reproduces the observed fir emission as well or better than the dism model , but the mir emission differs significantly .",
    "the uv emission shows the greatest degree of variation between best matches , particularly when unconstrained by observations ( e.g. ngc2976/3077 ) . in more distorted systems ( e.g. ngc3690/ic694 ) , its absorption is overestimated .",
    "the two pairs that include the large edge - on heavily obscured spiral ngc3190 , in contrast , did not find matches with sufficient absorption , and the uv emission of the pair containing the large elliptical ngc4649 is likewise overestimated .",
    "having established which simulated seds were best matched to each observed system , we compare the associated physical parameters such as ir luminosity , stellar mass , dust mass , and sfr to estimate how accurately they are recovered .",
    "many parameters are tracked by the hydrodynamic simulation ( e.g. stellar mass and sfr ) .",
    "the dust mass is assumed to be comprised of 40% of the metals within the gas ( also tracked during the simulations ) .",
    "the 3 - 1000@xmath8 m  luminosity is calculated as part of the sunrisepost - processing .",
    "we also compare the dust temperature estimates .",
    "to do so , we calculate a representative temperature by fitting the available fir ( @xmath40 m ) photometric data points of both the observed and simulated seds with a single @xmath41=1.5 optically - thin modified blackbody model . since some of our observed systems only have spire data in the fir , we were restricted to two free parameters .",
    "we also fit a similar blackbody with @xmath41=2 to estimate the uncertainty due to fixing @xmath41 .",
    "in any comparison of a suite of models to observations , two of the most important questions asked are : which areas of parameter space can be ruled out and which areas of parameter space give us the best matches ? for the sets of best and worst matches for the comparisons with the dism and aism seds , we examine trends in the distributions of simulations , snapshots , and viewing angles from which the matches originate . for each parameter of interest , we first examine the behavior of the mean and median @xmath39 as a function of the parameter and then discuss the source distributions .",
    "we will first examine the trends in the origins of the best and worst matched dism seds .",
    "the dism seds provide good matches for some of the observed systems ( e.g. ngc3226/3227 ) , although , for others ( e.g. ngc3424/3430 ) , the best - matched dism seds clearly underestimate the spire emission as can be seen in figure [ int_fits ] .",

    "while the aism temperatures scale with a noticeably flatter slope at low temperatures , its temperatures scale similarly above @xmath3030k .",
    "the tightness of these relations , for a given ism assumption suggests that the luminosity and dust mass are the main parameters necessary in setting the fir peak , while geometry likely only contributes to the scatter .",
    "the offset in dism simulations may be due to the fact that the simulated dust actually has a temperature distribution rather than a single temperature , whose hot dust could drive the effective temperature a bit higher . the offset in aism",
    "may be caused by dust self - absorption , resulting in an observed cooler temperature than the temperature of the hot core .",

    "we examine how well this classification works as a proxy for the location on the interaction sequence .",
    "however , each simulation proceeds at a unique pace governed by its particular combination of galaxy masses , mass ratios , and initial separation .",
    "hence , just comparing time relative to a single fixed event ( such as coalescence ) does not necessarily provide a useful comparison .",
    "for example , 1gyr before coalescence , m3m3 is approximately at the maximum separation after first passage , but m2m2 has not yet had its first pericenter passage .",

    "the vertical lines in the top panel of figure [ sim_time ] indicate the times of our landmarks in the m3m3 simulation .",
    "the first three are defined based on the separation of the central smbhs , which acts as a proxy for the separation of the galaxies .",
    "the first two landmarks are the first close approach and the moment of maximum separation after that initial passage .",
    "the simulations have a variety in the number of close approaches , which tend to increase with stellar mass ratio .",
    "the third landmark is the moment at which the two smbhs coalesce .",
    "however , in the major mergers where the increase in ir luminosity is pronounced , the peak luminosity occurs after that coalescence ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we define a fourth landmark when the ir luminosity has decreased from its peak to a low but steady level .",
    "we determine where each set of best matches fall between the landmarks .",
    "in the bottom panel of figure [ sim_time ] , we plot the range covered by these matches from the dism and aism comparisons against the dopita system classification .",
    "we generally do find that the strongly interacting ( strongly distorted ) systems originate from the period of black hole coalescence and peak ir emission .",
    "the exception is ngc3226/3227 s dism matches .",
    "we see a similar separation between the aism and dism matches in ngc2976/3077 .",
    "neither system has uv photometry and the shape of the uv simulated emission differs between the aism and dism matches .    for the other `` dopita classes '' , we do not find a clear trend of evolution along the interaction sequence with the morphologically determined classes , demonstrating that the sed alone is insufficient to uniquely determine the interaction stage .",
    "the moderately interacting systems span most of the sequence , as do the weakly interacting systems , several of which cluster mostly in the same period as the strongly interacting systems .",
    "there is , however , a strong caveat : our observational sample is fairly small .",
    "although we have seven pairs of weakly interacting galaxies , six originate from the same system ( the ngc3031-ngc3034 system ) , and ngc3034 is by no means a typical galaxy in the early interaction stages .",
    "similarly , our simulations make a good beginning at spanning the properties of our observed samples , but we would not claim that we are simulating counterparts specific to any of our observed system or indeed sampling the possible interaction types with great resolution .",
    "further , there is the additional complication that interaction stages defined by degree of morphological distortion suffer from some degeneracy .",
    "previous simulations of interacting systems have also demonstrated that the appearance at a given time during an interaction depends not only on the specific geometry of the encounter , but also on the masses , metallicities , gas contents , and previous interactions of the progenitor galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we use the landmarks described in section 5.2 to define five interaction stages : the initial approach , the first close passage , the separation post-1st passage , coalescence , and the relaxation period after the merger . for each stage , we determine the median sed for each of the equal - mass mergers ( e.g. , m0m0 ) as seen from one of the viewing angles .",
    "there is little difference between the median seds for different viewing angles because the galaxies do not share an equatorial plane , so there is no preferred viewing angle even early in the interaction .",
    "the uv has the greatest variation with viewing angle due to the obscuring effect of dust at those wavelengths ; the range covered by the camera angles is typically @xmath300.2 - 0.5dex in @xmath62  l@xmath63 increasing to almost an order of magnitude for about 50myr @xmath30200myr after coalescence in m2m2 and m3m3 .    in figure [ med_seds ] , we show the median seds for the four equal - mass mergers .",
    "we find that the coalescence stage typically has more luminous ir emission than the other stages , although it is also the stage with the highest variation in ir emission .",
    "although the median seds are broadly similar in shape , there are a few notable differences .",
    "we find a slight enhancement in the mir - fir after the 1st close passage in the two intermediate mass mergers m1m1 and m2m2 .",
    "similarly , the post - merger stage , during which the system has become an elliptical , show noticeably lower uv and fir in the three massive mergers . for comparison ,",
    "we include seds of the isolated simulations with similar stellar masses to each panel of figure [ med_seds ] .",
    "we find the median seds of first three interaction stages are typically bracketed over the observed wavelength range by the seds of isolated galaxies with lower and higher stellar masses than the total mass in the interaction , suggesting that these stages may not be distinguishable from isolated galaxies purely from the sed .",
    "we conclude that seds can only be used to identify systems in the most active phases of interaction or that have reached the post - merger stage in the more massive interactions .",
    "figure [ med_seds ] shows the large range of variation in the seds of the coalescence stage . as a result ,",
    "a system in the earliest interactions stages can have an sed very similar to a system in the less active portions of coalescence .",
    "therefore , systems in these early stages can not be identified purely from their seds .",
    "however , systems in the most active phases of coalescence in major mergers , during which the mir - fir emission increases greatly relative to the nir emission can be identified .",
    "similarly , systems that have become a post - merger elliptical and hence have very little fir relative to their nir emission can also be identified .",
    "we presented the first systematic comparison of seds of observed and simulated interacting galaxies .",
    "our sample of 31 galaxies was observed in up to 25 bands including _ galex _ , _ spitzer _ , and _",
    "we created a suite of gadget-3hydrodynamic simulation of four galaxies evolving in isolation and the ten pair - interactions evolved from first passage through coalescence to the post - merger stage .",
    "simulated seds were calculated using sunrisefor two different treatments of the ism s multiple phases , and sets of the best - matching of these seds were determined for each observed pair . from our comparison of the simulated and observed seds ,",
    "we conclude that : + ( 1 )  for most observed systems , at least one mock sed from the simulations provides a reasonably good ( often statistically acceptable ) fit to the observed sed .",
    "the best - matched seds generally come from the same simulation , often the major mergers .",
    "they tend to cluster around coalescence and the constraint in timing is tightest for the most evolved systems .",
    "we did not find , however , that best matches preferentially come from a certain viewing angle .",
    "( 2 )  neither treatment of the sub - resolution ism is preferred for our sample as a whole .",
    "some interactions are better matched when only the diffuse dust was used in the radiative transfer calculations ( dism ) while others have seds which are better reproduced especially in the fir when the total dust mass is used in the calculations ( aism ) .",
    "half of the observed interactions are equally well matched by the two sets of simulated seds .",
    "( 4 )  stellar and dust masses show indications that more massive ( or dustier ) systems tended to be matched by simulations of more massive ( or dustier ) galaxies , but greater coverage of the simulated parameter space is necessary to reliability recover stellar and dust masses .",
    "( 6 )  our sed matching techniques is able to reliably identify the interaction stage of the strongly interacting systems near coalescence .",
    "in contrast , the less strongly interacting morphology - based classes cover a wide range of interaction stages in their best matches .",
    "this suggests that the integrated sed alone is typically insufficient to identify the interaction stage , except for the most strongly interacting systems and the passively evolving merger remnants .",
    "( 7 )  the seds of the simulated systems in the different stages are generally quite similar , supporting our previous conclusion .",
    "the two exceptions are first , the passively evolving merger remnants ( which exhibit markedly less uv and fir emission because of quenching ) , and second , the most strongly interacting systems . for the latter ,",
    "the sed varies significantly because of the rapid variation in the sfr and agn luminosity . +",
    "our study improved upon the comparison of @xcite who tested sunriseagainst the seds of the sings galaxies by addressing two of the five issues of concern they raised : the small range of simulations available to them to fit normal galaxies , and the lack of treatment for the cold ism .",
    "regarding their first issue , we found in our larger range of systems that the simulations and sunrisedo a good ( albeit not perfect ) job of fitting observed seds over a much larger range than observed with sings . additionally , our study focused on the more complex conditions in interactions while @xcite examined how well isolated galaxies were reproduced .",
    "we concur with their assessment that this simulation process yields realistic results , although there remain areas of possible improvement such as a more realistic treatments of processes like star formation at smaller scales . regarding the issue of cold dust , their figure 16 ,",
    "for example , showed clearly that the observed mips 70@xmath8 m  and 160@xmath8 m  data points lie well away from the simulations colors , indicating the incomplete treatment of cold dust in the simulation .",
    "our pacs and spire data similarly demonstrates ( e.g. figure [ int_fits ] ) that very often the fir - submillimeter points are poorly reproduced , although our fits are much closer than the ones in the @xcite paper . we compared the dust using two treatments of sub - resolution ism structure in the simulations",
    "; we found that some galaxies match better with one treatment , while others are better matched with the other . with the current simulations , the sub - resolution structure of the ism remains a significant modeling uncertainty ( see figures [ sunrise ] and [ stdev_sunrise ] and the associated discussion ) .",
    "however , in future work , this uncertainty can be reduced considerably through the use of higher - resolution merger simulations that include a more - realistic multiphase ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this study has demonstrated that with even a relatively modest number of simulations , it is possible to match the seds of observed interacting galaxies with one or more mock seds from the simulations .",
    "furthermore , the best matches tend to come from relatively constrained regions of the physical parameter space , which suggests that the fits are reasonably non - degenerate . while a more expansive library of simulations may yield better matches to some of our observed systems , these comparisons , together with @xcite , demonstrate the feasibility of directly inferring physical quantities of galaxies by direct comparison with forward - modeled mock seds rather than through traditional sed modeling , assuming that the simulations span a sufficiently large parameter space with sufficiently fine sampling .",
    "although creating the template seds using this forward - modeling approach is orders - of - magnitude more computationally expensive than standard sed modeling , the advantage is that this approach is predictive in the sense that the seds are calculated self - consistently from hydrodynamical simulations ; the predictive nature of the forward - modeling approach yields additional value beyond inferring physical parameters of the galaxies , such as the possibility of examining the potential evolution and past of these systems .",
    "this work has utilized only the integrated seds of the simulated galaxies , but these represent only a tiny fraction of the information available from the simulations . in future work , we will more fully utilize the wealth of data available from the simulations by comparing the simulated and observed galaxy morphologies , for example , and determining what morphological information is encoded in the integrated seds .",
