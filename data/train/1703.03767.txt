    "energy release during solar flares involves all layers of the solar atmosphere .",
    "disturbances in the photosphere in the form of continuum emission are not frequent and usually observed in strongest flares .",
    "one of the most poorly understood phenomenon in the physics of solar flares is `` sunquakes '' initially detected by @xcite .",
    "the basic properties and theories of sunquakes can be found in the reviews of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "generally , sunquake represents a helioseismic response , which is observed in dopplergrams as concentric waves spreading out from an initial photospheric impact occurred during the impulsive phase of a solar flare .",
    "one scenario for initiation of sunquake waves is a hydrodynamic impact caused by expansion of the chromospheric plasma heated by injection of nonthermal charged particles accelerated in the corona @xcite .",
    "gas dynamics numerical modelling of the beam - driven theory @xcite predicts formation of a chromospheric shock that transfers the energy and momentum from the overheated chromospheric plasma to the colder and denser photosphere .",
    "this leads to compression and heating of the photosphere , and generation of helioseismic waves propagating into the deep solar interior .",
    "alternatively the plasma momentum can be transferred by other mechanisms , such as a sharp enhancement of the pressure gradient due to eruption of magnetic flux - rope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or by an impulse lorentz force which can be stimulated by changing magnetic fields in the lower solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discussed that rapid dissipation of electric currents in the low atmosphere could also explain sunquake initiation .",
    "however , it is possible that different sunquake events are caused by different mechanisms .    in this work",
    "we test the beam - driven theory of the photospheric impact and sunquake initiation .",
    "a large fraction of nonthermal electrons is thermalized in the chromosphere during their precipitation .",
    "this process is accompanied by the hxr emission .",
    "after that , a shock wave ( `` chromospheric condensation '' ) is generated , and travels from the chromosphere to the photosphere , producing helioseismic waves . according to this model",
    "there should be a time delay between the hxr pulse and the photosphere perturbation .",
    "our task is to find this delay and its value from the observations .",
    "data with high temporal resolution are needed to find such delay .",
    "we use x - ray observations of rhessi , @xcite and the level-1 sdo / hmi data ( filtergrams , @xcite ) .",
    "the hmi instrument scans the fe i 6173    line in different polarizations to determine the line - of - sight ( los ) magnetic field , continuum intensity , doppler velocity and the full magnetic field vector in the photosphere .",
    "the intensity , doppler and los magnetic field maps are obtained with the time cadence of 45 sec , and do not have enough temporal resolution for measuring the time delay .",
    "the level-1 hmi filtergrams have the temporal resolution of @xmath3 s ( for each of the two hmi cameras ) that is comparable with the rhessi time cadence of @xmath4 s. this gives us a chance to measure the time delay .    for analysis we selected the x1.8 solar flare of october 23 , 2012 , started approximately at 03:13:00 ut .",
    "this flare was located in active region noaa 1598 ( heliographic coordinates s13e58 ) .",
    "the flare generated a strong helioseismic waves travelling from a large scale photospheric disturbance well seen in all hmi observables .",
    "so far , this is the strongest sunquake of solar cycle 24 .",
    "also , this flare produced an intensive photospheric emission source during the impulsive phase . to determine the time delay between the hard x - ray impulse and the photospheric impact we develop a special procedure for analysis of the hmi filtergrams .",
    "for comparison with the flare hydrodynamics simulations radyn @xcite we use the nlte radiative transfer code rh @xcite to calculate the hmi line profile and its characteristics .",
    "temporal dynamics of the hard x - ray and hmi observables is shown in fig.[tp_sq]a .",
    "the figure presents the rhessi count rates in five energy ranges .",
    "time derivative of the total continuum intensity determined from the hmi data is shown by the black line .",
    "the total positive doppler speed signal in the flare region is shown by grey histogram . the total intensity and positive doppler speed",
    "are sums of all pixel s values in the region of significant enhancement of the continuum emission ( fig.[tp_sq]b ) .",
    "one can see that the maximum of the total continuum intensity time derivative corresponds to the hxr peak .",
    "the dopplergram signal enhancement in the flare region has a peak @xmath5 sec after the hxr peak .",
    "however , the 45-sec cadence of the hmi standard observables does not allow us to make a precise comparison with the 4-second rhessi count rate .",
    "sunquake sources are usually associated with strong impulsive photospheric doppler - shift signals and hxr sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we present a time - difference dopplergram ( fig.[tp_sq]c ) calculated at the peak of the hmi continuum flare emission ( fig.[tp_sq]b ) and projected onto the heliographic coordinates .",
    "the photospheric continuum emission enhancement as well as the doppler - shift perturbation during the hxr peak were observed as two ribbons @xmath6 long and @xmath7 apart .",
    "a significantly weaker continuum emission source was located about @xmath8 east from the strongest source ( fig.[tp_sq]b ) .",
    "the entire photospheric emission pattern had a circular shape .",
    "one can notice that the sizes and shapes of the continuum emission source and the region of the enhanced doppler - shifts are similar .",
    "the time profiles reveal that the doppler - shift perturbation is impulsive and precedes the peak of the total continuum emission ( fig.[tp_sq]a ) .",
    "circular shape of the photospheric emission sources is associated with a dome topology of the coronal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the sunquake event was initially revealed as an circular - shape wave in the running difference dopplergrams remapped onto the heliographic coordinates . to isolate the sunquake wave signal from the convective noise we filtered the running difference dopplergrams using an fft gaussian window filter with a central frequency of 6 mhz and width of 2 mhz .",
    "[ tp_sq]c , d illustrate the positions of the flare impact and the helioseismic fronts observed in the filtered doppler - shift data .",
    "the sunquake wave front ( fig.[tp_sq]d ) is best visible about 15 minutes after the initial flare impact in the photosphere .",
    "the wave front amplitude was highly anisotropic .",
    "two helioseismic wave fronts of different amplitudes ( weak and strong ) are found . the wave front traveling outside the sunquake source to the west had the highest amplitude .",
    "the time - distance ( td ) diagram for the strong helioseismic wave traveling toward the west is shown in fig.[tp_sq]e .",
    "two solid red lines in panels c and d show the orientation of the observational slit where we calculated the time - distance plot .",
    "we averaged the filtered dopplergram signal between the lines to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "dashed curve in the td plot represents the theoretical time - distance relation calculated in the ray approximation for a standard solar interior model of @xcite .",
    "one can see that the position of sunquake wave in the td diagram is in accordance with the theoretical prediction .",
    "thus , this shows that the observed wave was initiated in the region of the enhanced doppler shifts and continuum emission .",
    "the two hmi cameras scan the fe i line ( 6173   ) producing series of image with the pixel size of 0.5@xmath9 for six wavelength positions across the line and in the near continuum with a filter bandwidth ( fwhm ) @xmath10  m  with the total wavelength tunning range @xmath11  m  @xcite .",
    "camera 1 takes the images in linear polarization ; and camera 2 produces filtergrams in right and left circular polarizations .",
    "the filtegrams from both cameras are used to reconstruct the full stokes profiles . for the line - of - sight magnetograms , dopplergrams and continuum intensity ( level-2 ) data , only camera 2",
    "our idea is to use the filtergram data from both cameras to achieve a high temporal resolution in order to investigate variability of the photospheric flare emission sources and compare these with the rhessi hxr observations .",
    "the time cadence of the level-1 data from each camera is 3.6 seconds , or 1.8 seconds for the sequence of filtergrams from both cameras .",
    "the rhessi observations have the temporal resolution of 4 seconds determined by the spacecraft spinning period needed to obtain a full set of fourier components used for image reconstruction .",
    "first , for the hmi data analysis we subtract preflare filtergrams from the images taken during the impulsive phase .",
    "it allows us to detect changes in the flare region comparing with the preflare state .",
    "an example of such processed filtergram is shown in fig.[fft]a .",
    "then we compare the time profile of the filtergram pixel value for a quiet sun region ( point q1 ) with the time profile of the flare region ( point f2 ) shown in fig.[fft]b .",
    "the periodic variations are due to the line scanning . during the flare",
    "the line intensity is enhanced .",
    "it is evident that the periodic modulation does not allow us to directly compare the filtergram time profiles with the hxr lightcurves .    to remove the modulation we apply a fourier",
    "transform filter .",
    "figure  [ fft]c shows the power spectra of the quiet sun and flare regions for both cameras .",
    "one can see that the power spectrum for camera  1 is more complex than the spectrum for camera  2 .",
    "there are 15 peaks above @xmath12 threshold for camera  1 and only 7 for camera  2 .",
    "the largest peaks are harmonics of the 45-sec periodicity of the line scanning , and camera  1 data have additional modulation corresponding to the 135-sec observing cycle .",
    "one can see that the modulation peaks for the flare and quiet sun regions coincide with each other . to reduce the instrument modulation we apply gaussian filters with width of 10 mhz centered at the modulation peaks : 14  filters for camera  1 and 6 filters for camera  2 .",
    "the processed hmi filtergrams allow us to study the flare development with high temporal resolution .",
    "the initial photospheric flare perturbation was developed from weak photospheric brightenings ( filtergram at 03:14:57 ut in fig.[filter]a ) .",
    "then the flare emission is observed in four compact sources ( 03:15:09  ut , fig.[filter]b ) .",
    "later we observe a strong emission enhancement in the form of large scale ribbons ( 03:15:54  ut , fig.[filter]f ) .    also , in fig.[filter ] , we compare the photospheric flare emission sources with hxr sources from rhessi observations .",
    "the hxr images are synthesized in two energy bands 25 - 50 and 50 - 200 kev using the clean algorithm @xcite .",
    "rhessi detectors 2,3,5,6 and 7 are used for the analysis .",
    "the high rhessi count rate in this flare allows us to reconstruct the hxr images with the 4-second resolution and the pixel size of 2@xmath9 .",
    "the hxr image field of view is @xmath13 .",
    "the hxr sources were very dynamic during the flare impulsive phase .",
    "there were several hxr sources located in different parts of the photospheric flare ribbons .",
    "generally , the 25 - 50 kev sources did not exactly coincide with the 50 - 200 kev sources . in the begining of the impulsive phase ( 03:15:08 ut ) the hxr sources nicely fit the photospheric enhanced intensity kernels ( fig.[filter]b , c ) . during the maximum ( approximately at 03:15:54 ut ) the hxr emission source was relatively compact , had approximately circular shape with diameter of @xmath14 , and located in the south end of the photospheric ribbon .",
    "the demodulated hmi filtergram time profiles are shown in fig.[delay]a for three flare points located in different parts of flare ribbons ( see fig.[fft]a ) .",
    "points f1 and f2 are located in the sunquake source area . in fig.[delay]b",
    "the selected flare points are shown in the hinode / sot ( solar optical telescope ) time - difference red continuum ( 6684   ) image .",
    "we calculated photon fluxes in the region - of - interest ( roi , @xmath15 square region ) around the selected points .",
    "we show these lightcurves by blue and grey colors which correspond to the energy ranges of 25 - 50 and 50 - 200 kev .",
    "errors are calculated as @xmath16 ( i is hxr image pixel value ) assuming the poisson statistics @xcite .",
    "one can notice that the hxr emission in two considered energy ranges has a two peak structure in all three regions .",
    "the amplitude of these peaks are comparable with each other in points f2 and f3 .",
    "the second hxr peak and photospheric intensity maximum occurred almost simultaneously .",
    "the time delay of the photospheric perturbations relative to the absolute maxima of the roi hxr lightcurves is less than 4 seconds for points f1 and f2 . in point f3 the absolute maximum of the hxr lightcurve was 40 seconds earlier than maximum of the photospheric intensity enhancement .    to understand differences between the two hxr peaks we present imaging spectroscopy results in fig.[im_spec ] .",
    "the x - ray spectra were calculated for two different time intervals marked by grey vertical stripes in fig.[delay]a .",
    "these time intervals correspond to two hxr peaks .",
    "the thermal part ( @xmath17 kev ) was fitted by a single - temperature bremsstrahlung emission spectrum . the nonthermal part ( @xmath18 kev )",
    "was approximated by a double - power law , in which one power is fixed at 1.5 .",
    "it corresponds to the x - ray emission below low - energy cutoff @xmath19 of nonthermal electrons .",
    "the low - energy cutoff is simulated by a break in the spectrum . for higher energies ,",
    "spectral index @xmath20 is a free fitting parameter . for numerical stability",
    "@xmath19 is fixed , and equal to 20 kev . without fixing @xmath19",
    "the fitting procedure leads to large errors of the fitting parameters .",
    "the fitting parameters are summarized in fig.[im_spec ] caption .",
    "point  f1 is characterized by the strongest change in hxr hardness .",
    "spectral index @xmath20 changed from 3.7 to 2.9 .",
    "points f2 and f3 reveal minor changes in the hardness .",
    "the energy fluxes of nonthermal electrons were calculated following @xcite .",
    "these energy fluxes in the three flare points were 1.4@xmath21 , 1.7@xmath21 , and 0.8@xmath21  erg / s , respectively , during the first hxr peak .",
    "the second peak was characterized by lower nonthermal energy : 1.1@xmath21 , 1.5@xmath21 , and 0.7@xmath21  erg / s .",
    "to estimate the electron precipitation area one can assume that it represents a circular region with diameter equal to the photospheric ribbon width . from the hmi filtergrams one can determine the width of the photospheric ribbons as @xmath22  mm .",
    "this estimate gives the precipitation area of @xmath23  @xmath24 .",
    "the nonthermal electron energy flux per unit area is about @xmath25  erg s@xmath26@xmath27 for the total flux of @xmath28  erg / s . using the hinode / sot time difference images with pixel size of about  0.1@xmath9",
    ", one can deduce the area of the injection region more accurately .",
    "figures  [ delay]c , d show the image slices along the x direction for three y positions around point f1 ( panel c ) and f2 ( panel d ) . the ribbon width ( fwhm of intensity profile peaks )",
    "is in the range of @xmath29  mm . in this case",
    "the energy density flux is in the range of @xmath30  erg  s@xmath26@xmath27 .",
    "these estimates represent the high limit of the electron energy density flux . the lower limit of the energy density flux can be calculated also using the sot time difference images .",
    "the emission ribbons area above a threshold of 200  dns is about @xmath31  @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the low limit for the energy density flux is @xmath32  erg s@xmath26@xmath27 .",
    "using the hmi level-1 data ( filtergrams ) we determined positions of the photospheric intensity enhancements caused by the flare and extracted the time profiles with a 3.6-sec time cadence , and compared these with the high - cadence hxr data from rhessi .",
    "the results showed that the time delay between photospheric intensity peak and hxr peak is less than 4 seconds .    to compare with theoretical predictions we use the results of radiative hydrodynamic flare modelling from the radyn database @xcite , http://www.fchroma.org .",
    "the energy spectrum of nonthermal electrons is described by a power - law function with @xmath33 , the peak energy density flux of @xmath34  erg  s@xmath26  @xmath27 ( the highest avalaible ) , and the low energy cutoff of 25  kev .",
    "temporal profile of the nonthermal electron flux has a triangular shape and duration of 20 seconds .",
    "we consider the largest available energy density flux of nonthermal electrons . in the radyn database",
    ", this model provides the strongest response in the low atmosphere . using the plasma parameters and velocities from the radyn model as an input for the radiative transfer code rh @xcite we calculate the fe i 6173    line observed by hmi .",
    "the theoretical time delay between the electron flux peak and hmi line response is consistent with the observations ( fig.[im_spec]d ) .",
    "this shows that the radiative hydrodynamic models have a good potential for explaining the photospheric impacts .",
    "however the magnitude of the predicted impact is much weaker than in the observations .",
    "the doppler velocity perturbation shows a weak ( @xmath35  km / s ) upflow which almost coinsides with the heating function , followed by a gradual downflow .",
    "the amplitude of the plasma velocity in the photosphere in the model does not exceed 0.1 km / s .",
    "it is clear that the radyn flare model fails to explain the hmi continuum emission , and does not provide the momentum transfer that is needed for the sunquake initiation .",
    "our analysis shows that if the photospheric response is caused by the hydrodynamic response of the electron beam - heated atmosphere then the electron energy flux must be @xmath36  erg  s@xmath26  @xmath27 , much higher than in the currently available flare radiative hydrodynamic models .",
