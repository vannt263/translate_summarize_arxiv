    "over the last few decades , observational surveys have achieved unprecedented resolution , reaching sufficient sensitivity to resolve the central parsec of not only the milky way ( mw ) , but also its nearest neighbors in the local group , namely m31 , m32 and m33 .",
    "these observations revealed a number of anomalous stellar populations , typically very blue and massive stars whose presence is difficult to reconcile without an in situ origin .",
    "the origins of these curious populations have become an active area of research over the last few years .    within the core of the mw nuclear star cluster ( nsc ) complex , about a hundred ob stars",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "closer in to the very centre of the nucleus is an even more centrally ( @xmath1 0.01 pc ) compact structure called the s - star cluster consisting of main - sequence b - stars with randomly oriented and eccentric orbits @xcite , with eccentricities ranging up to 0.8 and having a median value of @xmath0 0.4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the existence of _ young _ stars in the very inner regions of the galactic centre would be puzzling , given that a super - massive black hole ( smbh ) is also present , called sgr a*. the standard picture for star formation involving the collapse of a self - gravitating cold molecular cloud is unlikely to happen due to the strong tidal field of the smbh . but the physics underlying star formation in such an extreme environment close to an smbh is highly uncertain , and other mechanisms can potentially be invoked ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite showed that , when a molecular cloud passes close to an smbh , it can become tidally disrupted and form a thin accretion disk .",
    "star formation could then occur if the density in the disk is sufficiently high for its own self - gravity to overcome the tidal force from the smbh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . alternatively ,",
    "a dense young cluster could migrate inward due to dynamical friction if it is sufficiently massive ( @xmath2 10@xmath4 m@xmath3 ) , provided it originates within a few parsecs of the central smbh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another mechanism to explain the blue stars at the galactic centre is stellar mergers , which can form rejuvenated main - sequence stars that appear young ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this could be facilitated by the central smbh , which forms an outer triple companion to any binary orbiting sufficiently close to it that its orbit is keplerian ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , stellar binaries could undergo large oscillations in their eccentricities and inclinations due to the kozai - lidov mechanism ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "tidal damping between binary companions could then shrink or circularize their orbits , or even drive a direct collision if the eccentricity becomes sufficiently high .",
    "merger products could also form when one of the binary components evolves off the main - sequence to over - fill its roche lobe @xcite .",
    "in addition to the surplus of blue stars very close to the central smbh , observations suggest a relative paucity of old evolved stars in the central half - parsec of our galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of the extreme extinction in the direction of sgr a * , these surveys reached a limiting magnitude of k@xmath5 18 , nevertheless indicating that the red giant branch ( rgb ) and horizontal branch ( hb ) stars with ages @xmath6 gyr and masses 0.5 - 4 m@xmath3 are less numerous than expected when assuming a normal ( e.g. kroupa ) initial stellar mass function @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the missing rgb stars in the galactic centre , including star - star collisions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "motivated by observations of the disk of blue stars orbiting sgr a * at @xmath0 0.04 - 0.6 pc , @xcite recently proposed star - disk collisions as a mechanism to deplete rgb stars which , in this scenario , collide repeatedly with star - forming cores in the natal gaseous disk that is speculated to form the blue stars .",
    "in the nearby spiral galaxy m31 , our current understanding of the inner nucleus is slightly less detailed than in the mw .",
    "this is in spite of the greater extinction in the direction of the galactic centre , and is partly due to the larger distance to m31 , making it less well resolved ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "m31 is home to two nuclear disks .",
    "a massive old disk of stars , called the p1+p2 complex , constitutes the inner nucleus , with a total mass of @xmath0 3 @xmath7 10@xmath8 m@xmath9 and a half - power radius of @xmath0 1.8 pc @xcite . inside this old disk and immediately surrounding the central smbh in m31 is a compact nuclear cluster of blue stars dubbed p3 , organized into a disk with half - power radius @xmath0 0.2 pc @xcite .",
    "the spectrum for p3 is consistent with a clump of stars in the spectral range b5-a5 , with an integrated magnitude m@xmath10 -5.7 @xcite .",
    "4200 m@xmath3 ( assuming many additional unseen low - mass main - sequence stars ) . ]",
    "many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the blue cluster at the very centre of m31 .",
    "several authors have invoked a recent burst of star formation near the central smbh to explain these anomalous blue stars .",
    "for example , @xcite illustrated that the integrated spectrum and spectral energy distribution is consistent with a burst of star formation @xmath0 200 myr ago .",
    "this was later improved upon by @xcite , who fit padova isochrones for single - burst populations with ages of 50 , 100 and 200 myr to an observed colour - magnitude diagram of the blue cluster p3 .",
    "@xcite argued that gas from stellar evolution - induced mass loss can reach surface densities sufficiently high to induce fragmentation and star formation in the immediate vicinity of the smbh . in this picture , the gas ends up being funneled into orbit about the smbh due to the non - axisymmetric structure of the surrounding m31 nucleus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , @xcite pointed out that the observed spectrum of the hot stars in p3 is also consistent with an old stellar population in the extended or post - horizontal branch phase of evolution , or even blue stragglers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the blue stragglers ( bss ) could be created from direct stellar collisions and/or mergers , while the extended horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars could be the result of tidal stripping of red giant branch stars by the smbh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite considered a collisional origin for the hot stars in m31 .",
    "the author found a collision rate that is too small to account for their origins , however this result rests on the critical assumption that the collisions occur within a spherical stellar distribution surrounding the central smbh .",
    "more recent observations have demonstrated that this assumption is not correct , and the distribution more closely resembles the eccentric disk model of @xcite ( see section  [ app ] for more details ) .    in the nearby dwarf elliptical m32 , there is no evidence for a central blue excess in the inner nucleus .",
    "there is little indication of any change in the optical and uv colours in the very inner regions of the nucleus close to the putative central smbh .",
    "although slightly bluer colors are observed in the very central pixels of a wfpc f555w - f814w color image by @xcite , the u - v colours should more sensitively probe for a central blue excess , and this becomes _ redder _ toward the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the authors conclude that m32 does _ not _ harbor an excess of blue stars in the very inner regions of the nucleus .",
    "weaker co lines and redder continuum are also observed in the inner @xmath0 0.9 pc , but this is thought to be due to dust emission .",
    "this trend can not be explained from changes in the stellar populations in the m32 nucleus , unlike the mw nsc where weaker co lines are attributed to a dearth of rgb stars @xcite .",
    "the stellar density in m32 is one of the highest ever observed ( @xmath0 10@xmath8 m@xmath3 ) , and should ( naively ) be more than sufficient for collisions to occur .",
    "however , missing rgb stars can not by themselves explain the observed trend between weaker co lines and a redder continuum reported by @xcite , since this would contribute to a bluer , not redder , k - band continuum .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been proposed for the origins of the m32 nucleus , which consists of a puffed up disk embedded in a more spherical stellar distribution .",
    "@xcite suggest that the disk component could have formed by gas accretion into the nucleus , triggered by a major or minor merger in the recent past .",
    "the author concedes , however , that secular processes alone could still be responsible for the disk kinematics .",
    "another possibility for the formation of the nuclear disk in m32 , originally proposed by @xcite and later ( briefly ) re - visited by @xcite , is the gradual build - up of gas from stellar winds in the surrounding population .",
    "this might naturally predict a trend in stellar age as a function of radius and the observed lack of any break in the rotation curve , while also potentially accounting for an observed abundance gradient in which the [ mg / fe ] ratio begins at subsolar values in the inner nucleus and increases at larger radii @xcite .    finally , in the nearby spiral galaxy m33 , a strong b - r colour gradient exists in the nucleus , such that the central part of the nsc is bluer than its outskirts .",
    "@xcite tried to reproduce the spectrum of the m33 nucleus using a population synthesis method comprised of a series of star clusters of different ages .",
    "as further discussed in @xcite , the results find that the integrated spectrum can be explained if it is dominated by a young metal - rich population , which is very different from the spectrum of an old globular cluster in the near - infrared .",
    "using high resolution photometry , @xcite and later @xcite noted a colour gradient in the optical , with a central concentration of blue stars .",
    "this was later confirmed via high resolution uv imaging ; the nucleus is bluer and even more compact than at longer wavelengths ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "surface photometry of the nuclear region in m33 suggests an average isophotal shape @xmath11 0.16 @xmath12 0.01 , with the nsc becoming rounder toward its centre .",
    "given that the relaxation time in m33 is thought to be very short , this ellipticity is thought to be due to rotation instead of an anisotropic velocity ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite discuss this central blue excess in the context of blue stragglers ( bss ) formed from stellar collisions .",
    "@xcite further suggested that the short relaxation time could mean that core - collapse has previously occurred , which might increase the collision rate in the inner nucleus .",
    "indeed , the half - power radius of the central nuclear region is only 0.13 pc .",
    "@xcite performed stellar population modeling of stis spectra , and found that the data can best be fit assuming two distinct stellar populations , with masses and ages of 9000 m@xmath3 at 40 myrs and 7.6 @xmath7 10@xmath13 m@xmath3 at 1 gyr , respectively .    in this paper , we re - visit the issue of the origins of the blue stars observed in the very central regions of local group nuclei , with an emphasis on comparing and contrasting the different theoretical mechanisms proposed to explain the observed properties of these curious populations . throughout this paper , we will use the term `` blue stars '' to refer to a secondary stellar population , defined relative to an underlying primary population with a much redder mean colour .",
    "the total amount of blue light is sufficient that accounting for both populations with a single stellar mass function would require some non - canonical spike or special feature in order to reproduce the secondary population .",
    "the origins of these blue stars are unknown , as are their ages .",
    "we will use the term `` young stars '' to refer to blue stars that are very young relative to a primary old population .",
    "we focus on the different channels for mediating direct collisions and mergers ( involving old stars ) , as a function of the host nuclear star cluster environment . in section  [ rates ] , we present order - of - magnitude estimates for the rates of ms+ms , ms+rgb , ms+wd , wd+rgb , ms+ns , bh+rgb and single - binary ( 1 + 2 ) collisions , suitable for different assumptions about the properties of the nucleus . in section  [ ehbform ] , we present stellar evolution models of tidally stripped rgb stars , which illustrate that the photometric appearance and subsequent evolution are roughly insensitive to the degree of mass loss ( unless nearly the entire envelope is removed ) .",
    "we discuss in section  [ app ] the observed properties of the nuclei in the mw , m31 , m32 and m33 , which decide the appropriate form of our derived collision rates , and we present the calculated collision rates for these different nscs , as a function of the distance from the cluster centre .",
    "we discuss in section  [ discussion ] the implications of our results for the role of collisional processes in shaping the observed properties of dense unresolved stellar populations .",
    "we go on to discuss the relevance of our results for inferring age spreads in nuclear star clusters , as well as the most probable formation mechanism for the inner blue stars observed in three out of four nscs in the local group .",
    "we summarize our main conclusions in section  [ summary ] .",
    "in this section , we derive order - of - magnitude estimates for the mean rate of collisions and mergers , as a function of the host nuclear cluster environment . these include direct collisions between main - sequence ( ms ) stars , tidal stripping of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars via direct ms+rgb , wd+rgb and bh+rgb collisions , direct collisions between main sequence stars and both neutron stars ( nss ) and white dwarfs ( wds ) ( which could serve as a prolific source of gas in the nucleus ; see section  [ discussion ] for more details ) , direct encounters between stellar binaries and ms stars ( which typically produce a ms+ms collision ) and kozai - lidov oscillations mediated by an smbh acting as the outer third companion . all collisions and mergers are assumed to involve only old stars , in an effort to evaluate if each mechanism could account for the blue populations observed in three out of the four nuclei considered here .",
    "note that dense galactic nuclei have high velocity dispersions , and are hence predicted to have low binary fractions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , binary - binary ( 2 + 2 ) encounters are irrelevant for our purposes , since 1 + 2 encounters dominate over 2 + 2 encounters for binary fractions @xmath1 10% @xcite .",
    "first , we calculate the mean rate of collisions in a nuclear star cluster with a central smbh of mass m@xmath14 .",
    "we begin by considering a nuclear disk with predominantly keplerian orbits about the central smbh .",
    "we then go on to consider a spherical pressure - supported system surrounding a central smbh .",
    "we then combine these limiting cases in order to provide a single formula for the collision rate that is applicable to every nsc in our sample since , as described in section  [ app ] , each nsc can be reasonably well described by one of these two limiting regimes .",
    "the stellar orbits surrounding a central smbh will be roughly keplerian if they are within the radius of influence r@xmath15 of the smbh .",
    "for a nuclear disk , for example , the bulk of the stellar orbits will be approximately keplerian provided the influence radius significantly exceeds the scale length of the disk a. the influence radius is approximately defined as @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the velocity dispersion of the surrounding nsc .",
    "we begin by calculating and comparing the relevant velocities , namely the escape velocity from the stellar surface v@xmath18 , the hill velocity v@xmath19 and the velocity dispersion @xmath17 .",
    "a comparison of these velocities determines the importance of gravitational - focusing during collisions .",
    "we assume that all stars in the nsc are identical , with masses m and radii r. for ( old ) low - mass main - sequence stars , a reasonable approximation is m / r @xmath0 m@xmath3/r@xmath3 .",
    "thus , the escape velocity from the surface of a typical star in the disk / cluster is : @xmath20 which gives @xmath0 618 km / s assuming m @xmath21 1 m@xmath3 and r @xmath21 1 r@xmath3 .    at the hill radius r@xmath19 ,",
    "the orbital frequency of a body in orbit about a star is comparable to the orbital frequency of the star around the central smbh .",
    "the hill velocity is then the characteristic velocity associated with the hill radius , or : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and r is the distance from the central smbh . plugging equation  [ eqn : rhill ] into equation  [ eqn : vhill ]",
    ", we obtain : @xmath24 in m31 , for example , equation  [ eqn : vhill2 ] yields v@xmath19 @xmath0 1.1 km / s , assuming a scale length for the disk of a @xmath21 1.8 pc @xcite , m @xmath21 1 m@xmath3 and m@xmath25 1.4 @xmath7 10@xmath26 m@xmath3 @xcite .    if @xmath17 @xmath27 v@xmath18 , then we are in the super - escape regime , so that gravitational - focusing can be neglected .",
    "conversely , in the sub - escape and super - hill regime v@xmath28 @xmath17 @xmath29 v@xmath18 gravitational - focusing is significant .",
    "we do not consider the sub - hill regime ( i.e. @xmath30 v@xmath19 ) , since the hill velocity is always very small in galactic nuclei .",
    "putting this all together , the collision rate for a keplerian nuclear disk can be written : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and the second term in equation  [ eqn : gamma1 ] smoothly transitions the collision rate into and out of the regime where gravitational - focusing becomes important .",
    "the stellar surface mass density is : @xmath33 where m@xmath34 is the total stellar mass of the disk , a is its scale length and h is its scale height .",
    "equation  [ eqn : gamma1 ] gives the mean rate at which a given star or object orbiting at a distance r from the central smbh collides with other objects .",
    "next , we consider an nsc for which the dominant stellar distribution is ( approximately ) spherical , pressure - supported and the stellar motions are predominantly random . here",
    ", we assume that the stellar orbits are distributed isotropically and the velocity distribution is isothermal ( i.e. , maxwellian with dispersion @xmath35 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similar to equation  [ eqn : gamma1 ] , an order - of - magnitude estimate for the mean rate @xmath36 at which a given star or object undergoes direct collisions with other objects is : @xmath37 where , as before , the second term smoothly transitions the collision rate into and out of the regime where gravitational - focusing becomes important . in equation  [ eqn : gamma9 ]",
    ", we use the local velocity dispersion @xmath17 , calculated as : @xmath38 this serves to modify the velocity dispersion very close to the central smbh , where the stellar orbits begin transitioning into the keplerian regime .",
    "finally , combining equations  [ eqn : gamma1 ] and  [ eqn : gamma9 ] , we obtain a general formula for the rate of collisions in a nuclear star cluster with or without a central smbh : @xmath39 as we will show in section  [ app ] , equation  [ eqn : gamma10 ] reasonably describes the collision rates in every galactic nucleus in our sample , provided we set _ either _ @xmath40 0 or @xmath41 0 .",
    "this is because , within our chosen outer limit of integration ( i.e. , 2 pc ) , the dominant nsc structure is either well described by one of these two extremes , namely an ( approximately ) spherical pressure - supported system ( i.e. , the mw , m32 and m33 ) or a keplerian disk ( i.e. , m31 ) .      in this section ,",
    "we derive order - of - magnitude estimates for the mean rate of binary mergers mediated by kozai - lidov oscillations with an smbh acting as the outer triple companion , as a function of the host nuclear environment and distance from the central smbh .    the characteristic time - scale for eccentricity oscillations to occur due to the kozai - lidov mechanism is @xcite : @xmath42 where m@xmath43 2 m is the binary mass , r is the distance from the smbh , e@xmath14 is orbital eccentricity of the binary s orbit about the central smbh , a@xmath44 is the binary orbital separation and p@xmath44 is the binary orbital period . the rate at which binaries merge due to kozai - lidov oscillations within a given distance from the smbh is then : @xmath45 for a nuclear disk , and @xmath46 for a spherical pressure - supported nucleus . here , f@xmath44 is the fraction of objects that are binaries , and f@xmath47 is the fraction of binaries with their inner and outer orbital planes aligned such that kozai cycles operate .",
    "for simplicity , we assume f@xmath48 1 . thus , the calculated rates are strict upper limits , since they assume that every binary is aligned relative to the smbh such that kozai oscillations will occur , which is certainly not the case .",
    "we will return to this issue in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "importantly , equation  [ eqn : taukl ] , and hence equations  [ eqn : gammakl1 ] and  [ eqn : gammakl2 ] , are only valid at distances from the smbh smaller than @xcite : @xmath49 where e@xmath44 is the orbital eccentricity of the binary star .",
    "this is due to general relativistic , or schwarzschild apsidal , precision in the binary star @xcite .",
    "in this section , we quantify the effects of collisions and , specifically , the subsequent tidal stripping on the photometric appearance of rgb stars .",
    "our primary concern is the stellar evolution , so we do not specify the nature of the impactor . instead ,",
    "we look at how discrete mass loss events affect the subsequent time evolution of the rgb luminosity and radius . we note here that our calculated collision rates are sufficiently high that the underlying rgb populations could be significantly affected , and these stars dominate the light distribution in an old stellar population . due to the high extinction toward the galactic centre ,",
    "for example , these are the only ( `` old '' ) stars that can be observed .    stars of initial massyr ] @xmath50 become rgbs stars .",
    "exhaustion of hydrogen in the core is followed by burning of hydrogen to helium in a thin shell ; the luminosity at the beginning of this evolutionary stage , i.e. at the base of the giant branch ( bgb ) , is approximated by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath51 where m is the mass of the star .",
    "the mass of the helium core gradually increases , and the star s radius and luminosity shoot up as the star climbs the giant branch . in stellar evolution models ,",
    "the radius and luminosity during the giant phase are determined almost uniquely by the mass , @xmath52 , of the ( helium ) core .",
    "approximate relations for @xmath53 are @xcite : @xmath54 the dominant energy source during these evolutionary phases is the cno cycle , and so the rate of energy production is tied to the rate of increase of the core mass by [ eqn : lpp ] l_gb 1.44 10 ^ 5 . given an initial core mass , equations  [ eqn : lrrg]-[eqn : lpp ] can be solved for the dependence of @xmath52 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 on time .",
    "the surface temperature is given by the stefan - boltzmann law ( however , at late times , the maximum radius is limited by mass loss ) .",
    "the initial core mass  that is , the mass of the hydrogen - exhausted helium core at the time the main sequence turnoff is reached  is given by @xcite : m_c .",
    "for instance , for @xmath57 m@xmath3 , the initial core mass is @xmath58 and the initial core mass ratio is @xmath59 .    for stars with masses",
    "@xmath60 the evolution on the rgb is interrupted when @xmath52 has grown to approximately @xmath61 .",

    "the luminosity at the tip of the giant branch ( tgb ) is roughly @xmath65 .",
    "mass loss can significantly alter the evolution of an rgb star .",
    "for instance , it can prevent the star from igniting he , and therefore terminate the star s evolution at an earlier stage . in order to study the response of rgb stars to episodes of intense mass loss",
    ", we used the stellar evolution code  stars @xcite .",
    "we compute evolution tracks for stars with various zams masses , applying the @xcite prescription for the mass loss rate due to stellar winds . at some point during the rgb phase , we switch to a constant mass loss regime at the rate @xmath66 . during this time we turn off changes in composition due to nuclear burning , while retaining energy production . when the stellar mass is reduced to a certain value , @xmath67 , we halt the rapid mass loss regime , and continue with `` normal '' stellar evolution by turning the de  jager mass loss rate prescription back on , which in turn allows for composition changes to re - initiate .",
    "this numerical procedure allows us to study the evolution of stars undergoing an episode of mass loss on a time scale much shorter than their nuclear time scale , as is the case for an rgb star that is tidally stripped of its envelope",
    ".    figure  [ fig : fig1 ] displays stellar evolution tracks on the rgb , after different amounts of envelope stripping .",
    "stars will not reach the tgb if the total stellar mass is smaller ( due to stellar winds ) than the he core mass at the tgb of the progenitor star . in this case , the star will instead climb the giant branch until the mass of its hydrogen exhausted he core is essentially equal to its total stellar mass , at which point it will turn off the giant branch to the blue at the same luminosity as other stars of the same total mass .",
    "the star will fail to ignite he and will subsequently cool off to become a white dwarf with an he core . if the mass left in the star is instead large enough that its he core mass can reach that of the parent star at the moment of he ignition , then the remnant will also ignite he at roughly the same luminosity as its ( unperturbed ) parent star . in this scenario ,",
    "the star eventually cools off to become a white dwarf with a co core .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows that , for stars of total mass @xmath68 , to significantly alter the evolution and make the tgb fainter requires @xmath69 . for @xmath70 , we require instead @xmath71 to be removed or , equivalently , more than @xmath72 of the star s envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we find that the overall stars evolution is relatively insensitive to the luminosity at which the mass loss episode occurs .",
    "following mass removal , a star will nearly return to its initial luminosity on the rgb , but will move onto the point on the hayashi track corresponding to its new mass .",
    "this is independent of the luminosity at which tidal stripping occurs .",

    "more specifically , over a 1 gyr period , on the order of 710 @xmath0 10@xmath104 ms+ms collisions should occur , which is roughly 0.1% of the total stellar mass in this region .",
    "after an initial rise from r @xmath21 0 , the number of collision products remains roughly constant with increasing distance from the smbh . as shown in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ,",
    "the predicted collision rates for a particular object show a near monotonic decrease with increasing distance from the cluster centre , after a relatively constant inner core that extends out to only @xmath0 0.2 pc .",

    "this is the case for both of our assumed density profiles , which yield very similar collision rate profiles , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "thus , we might expect a relatively weak central concentration of blue stars in the mw , assuming a collisional origin ( ignoring any possible mass segregation of collision products ) .",
    "the core radius given in equation 4 of @xcite is much smaller than the smbh influence radius , such that the stellar orbits within this core should be roughly keplerian .",
    "this is what creates a central drop in some collision numbers within the core , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "however , this inner core is such a small fraction of the total volume over which we integrate the collision rates that this correction should have a relatively negligible impact on the total numbers of collision products .",
    "very roughly , the numbers of 1 + 2 collisions that occur over a @xmath2 10 gyr period should be comparable to the total number of binaries in the mw nsc , for our assumed binary fraction and considering only hard binaries .",
    "the hard - soft boundary in the mw nsc corresponds to the binary components being in ( or nearly in ) contact , due to the very high velocity dispersion .",
    "hence , the probability of a direct collision or merger occurring during an encounter involving such a hard binary is nearly unity for small impact parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the collision product should expand post - collision by a factor of @xmath0 a few ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , driving the remaining binary components to merge when their radii overlap at periastron .",
    "conversely , encounters involving soft binaries should have a high probability of being dissociative , or of significantly increasing the binary separation post - encounter such that the time - scale for a subsequent encounter ( with an even higher probability of dissociation ) becomes very short .",
    "thus , only ( near ) contact binaries should survive in the galactic centre for any significant amount of time although many will also be destroyed , and our estimate for the binary fraction in the mw nsc ( i.e. , f@xmath43 0.01 ) could be an over - estimate of the true binary fraction .",
    "with that said , it seems unlikely that the disk of o- and b - type stars observed at @xmath0 0.1 pc from sgr a * has a collisional origin .",
    "first , although collisions should be dissipative , there is no obvious reason why the collision products should arrange themselves into a disk - like configuration in a spherical pressure - supported nucleus .",
    "second , given the average stellar mass in the mw nsc , multiple collisions would be required to form these massive o- and b - type stars , which must have occurred over a very short interval of time , since o- and b - stars have very short lifetimes .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] suggests that the rate of collisions involving individual ms stars is too low for this to be the case .",
    "interestingly , however , the rate of ms+wd collisions is sufficiently high that a non - negligible supply of gas could be supplied to the nucleus via this mechanism ( especially assuming the density profile in @xcite ) .",
    "this is because collisions between stars and wds should act to ablate the star , nearly independent of the cluster velocity dispersion ( see section  [ discussion ] for more details regarding the underlying physics responsible for this mechanism for gas liberation ; @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism could supply on the order of @xmath1 10@xmath104 m@xmath9 in gas every @xmath0 1 gyr in the mw nsc .",
    "this is because , using the density profile of @xcite , on the order of @xmath0 100 ms / rgb+wd collisions happen every 100 myr ( see table  [ table : one ] ) . assuming that most ms stars undergoing ms+wd collisions are close to the turn - off , which is of order @xmath0 1 m@xmath3 for an old population , then figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ( see the dot - dashed line ) suggests that the he core mass should comprise a small fraction of the total stellar mass ( @xmath1 0.2 m@xmath3 or 20% ) when the collision occurs .",
    "hence , for our purposes , a reasonable assumption for the mean mass in gas liberated per ms / rgb+wd collision is @xmath0 0.8 m@xmath3 ( i.e. , the envelope , or all material outside of the degenerate core ) . assuming 10@xmath104 ms / rgb+wd collisions per 1 gyr , this predicts @xmath0 800 m@xmath3 @xmath0 10@xmath104 m@xmath3 in gas should be supplied to the inner nucleus every gyr due to ms+wd collisions alone .",
    "the above back - of - the - envelope calculation suggests that ms+wd collisions alone can not supply enough gas to form stars .",
    "this is because the time required to accumulate enough gas to form an actual disk is much longer than the gas cooling time ( of order a few to a few hundred years , for either optically thick or thin disks ) , which must be less than roughly 3 times the local dynamical time - scale @xcite .",
    "thus , if star formation were to occur only from gas supplied by ms+wd collisions , then it should only occur after nearly a hubble time .",
    "given that stellar mass - loss in the surrounding old population should likely supply gas to the inner nucleus at a comparable or even higher rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the fact that the gas must not be accreted by the central smbh before it fragments to form stars , we conclude that , while ms+wd collisions could contribute non - negligibly to the gas supply in the inner nucleus , this mechanism seems by itself insufficient to form stars and an additional source of gas is needed .    as shown in section  [ ehbform ] , nearly the entire rgb envelope must be stripped to significantly affect the photometric appearance of an rgb star .",
    "given that more than one collision is typically required to strip an rgb of its envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the derived rate for a given rgb star to encounter other ms stars is too low for collisions to contribute significantly to the observed paucity of giants ( as shown by the dotted red line in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "assuming instead an isothermal density profile that starts to diverge near the smbh , only in the inner @xmath1 0.1 pc could the rate become sufficiently high for any given rgb star to encounter more than a single ms star within @xmath1 1 gyr ( i.e. the typical lifetime of an rgb star ) .",
    "although we expect bh+rgb collisions to be more effective at stripping the rgb envelope on a per collision basis @xcite , we find that the rate of bh+rgb collisions is likely too low for more than a handful of rgb stars to have been fully stripped .",
    "we conclude that it seems difficult to account for any missing rgb stars in the galactic centre via collisions .",
    "this is consistent with the general picture described in @xcite , which suggests that the stellar density of the underlying ( not yet observed ) old population traces that of the observed rgb stars , and has always been low . in the absence of star formation ,",
    "a low initial density remains low for a long time , since the relaxation time is very long .",
    "figures 4 and 5 in @xcite show that a model with a core can reproduce the observed number counts of rgb stars in the mw .",
    "our fiducial model for the mw also has a core , which is partly responsible for the low predicted numbers of collisions involving rgb stars .",
    "thus , the low observed density of rgb stars could be consistent with being a natural consequence of a low ( initial ) density in the underlying old population .",
    "this picture is consistent with the low rate of rgb collisions found here , which would not be able to account for any inferred paucity of rgb stars .    to summarize , the predicted rates of single - single collisions are too low to have significantly affected the photometric appearance of the mw nsc .",
    "this is the case for stars belonging to any evolutionary stage . in particular ,",
    "ms+ms collisions should have produced @xmath1 1% of the total stellar mass in collision products after a hubble time .",
    "collisions involving individual rgb stars occur too infrequently for the rgb envelope to have been affected significantly , and any paucity of rgb stars to be observed .",
    "the rate of single - binary collisions , on the other hand , is sufficiently high that very few binaries should remain at the present day , if any .",
    "finally , the rate of ms+wd collisions is insufficient to supply enough gas to form stars and , while this mechanism for gas accumulation could contribute non - negligibly to a single burst of star formation , an additional source of gas is also needed .",

    "p3 , on the other hand , has the highest velocity dispersion measured to date , with a central dispersion of 1183 @xmath12 200 km / s @xcite .",
    "the most likely explanation for the double - lobed structure of p1+p2 is an eccentric disk viewed in projection .",
    "this was originally proposed by @xcite , who argued that p1 and p2 are unlikely to be two distinct star clusters caught during the final stages of a merger , since the merger would occur within @xmath1 10@xmath26 years by dynamical friction @xcite . to reconcile this",

    "conversely , the fainter lobe , p2 , can be accounted for if it corresponds approximately to pericentre and the disk density increases toward the central smbh .",

    "our collision rate estimates in section  [ collisions ] are based on alterations to the formulation provided in @xcite , originally derived to treat collisions within protoplanetary disks .",
    "this approach can be almost directly applied in m31 , since the total mass of the tremaine disk is m@xmath34 @xmath0 3 @xmath7 10@xmath8 m@xmath3 @xcite ( assuming all 1.0 m@xmath3 stars and a mass - to - light ratio of 5.7 , which is appropriate for a bulge population @xcite ) .",

    "the velocity dispersion in m31 is so high that the hard - soft boundary corresponds to the binary components being in contact .",
    "hence , for small impact parameters , the probability of a direct collision or merger occurring during any direct 1 + 2 encounter involving a hard binary is approximately unity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "conversely , the probability of dissociation during encounters involving soft binaries is very high .",
    "thus , even ( most ) contact binaries should not have survived until the present - day , and our estimate for the binary fraction in the m31 nucleus could be an over - estimate of the true binary fraction .",
    "ms+wd collisions should liberate on the order of 10@xmath4 m@xmath9 in gas every @xmath0 1 gyr , which can subsequently be used to form young ( blue ) stars .",

    "thus , these results suggest that star formation should occur on the order of every @xmath0 1 gyr in m31 , if the only supply of gas to the inner nucleus is ms+wd collisions",

    "additionally , given such high relative velocities at impact , some direct ms+ms collisions could completely unbind or ablate the collision product , leaving behind a puffed - up cloud of gas and dust in its place @xcite .",
    "similarly , grazing or off - centre collisions could ( eventually ) leave behind a very rapidly rotating collision product . in any event ,",
    "the collisional velocities at impact are sufficiently high in m31 very close to the central smbh that gas can be supplied to the nsc not only via ms+wd and wd+rgb collisions , but also via ms+ms and ms+rgb collisions ( in addition to mass loss due to stellar evolution ) . additionally , we caution that , if a non - negligible fraction of ms+ms collisions ablate the product completely , then we might not expect any central rise in the numbers of blue stragglers , but rather a dip in the numbers . alternatively ,",
    "if the products of ms+ms collisions are not ablated , then the deposited kinetic energy at impact will serve to puff up the collision product , reducing the time - scale for subsequent collisions to occur . immediately after a collision , the product shoots up the hayashi track before contracting back down to the main - sequence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , at least temporarily , the collision product will be brighter and redder than a normal ms star of the same mass .",
    "interestingly , the photometric appearance of the object observed at the nominal centre of p3 , called s11 , is qualitatively consistent with this general picture , since it is the brightest and reddest object in the central blue cluster @xcite .",
    "to summarize , the predicted rate of ms+ms collisions is sufficiently high in the inner @xmath1 parsec of the m31 nucleus that most , if not all , of the mass of the inner blue disk in m31 could be composed of ms+ms collision products , or blue stragglers .",
    "importantly , these collisions would have dissipated orbital angular momentum and , given the disk - like nature of the m31 nsc , the thin disk - like structure of the inner blue excess is in general consistent with a collision origin .",
    "note that the additional concentration of collision products within the plane of the surrounding disk is unique to the m31 nucleus , relative to the other nscs in our sample .",
    "we caution that ms+ms collisions could become ablative in the inner @xmath1 0.1 pc due to the very high velocity dispersion here , which predicts impact velocities with enough kinetic energy to exceed the binding energy of any collision product .",
    "this would contribute to the total gas supply in the inner m31 nucleus , but likely not enough to form the inner blue disk in a burst of star formation .",
    "on the other hand , ms+wd collisions , which should be largely ablative nearly independent of the impact velocity , could contribute significantly to the total gas reservoir in the inner nucleus .",
    "together with stellar evolution - induced mass loss in the surrounding old population , this could supply enough gas to form stars in much less than a gyr .",
    "finally , the rate at which individual rgb stars collide with other objects is sufficiently high in the inner @xmath1 0.1 pc that enough collisions could have occurred to completely unbind the rgb envelope , causing an observed paucity of rgb stars in the inner m31 nucleus .    with the above results in mind , we note that @xcite found from a similar analysis of analytic collision rates calculated for the m31 nucleus that collisions alone can not account for the blue excess observed at r @xmath29 0.6 pc .",

    "below , we highlight the relevant physics for the development of improved theoretical models , which are needed for comparison to existing and future observational data .      the presence of very blue stars in the inner nuclear regions is typically argued to be evidence for a recent ( in situ ) burst of star formation .",
    "this is because the timescale for such a cluster of young stars to inspiral into the nucleus via dynamical friction tends to exceed the age of the stars , for all but extremely close initial distances from r @xmath21 0 .",

    "upon consideration of the entire sample at once , however , more stringent constraints can perhaps be placed .",
    "for example , if the star formation occurs in a single burst , some fine - tuning must be required to produce 3 out of 4 galactic nuclei with recent star formation within @xmath1 0.1 pc of the galactic centre at the current epoch .",
    "this is because , relative to the lifetimes of the older populations in these nscs , the young blue stars would live for only a very short time .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that all three nuclei were caught in the act of recent star formation , unless the process is continuous or episodic with a short recurrence time .",
    "if correct , then significant star formation must have previously occurred in the nucleus as well .",
    "it follows that the most recent burst would have to occur in the presence of a significant population of remnants orbiting within @xmath1 0.1 pc .",
    "this predicts that a high mass - to - light ratio could also be present along with any inner blue excess , and that significant x - rays could be observable due to gas accretion onto these inner remnants ( if gas is still being supplied to the inner nucleus ; see below ) .",
    "interestingly , as shown in section  [ app ] , the rates of ms+wd collisions are sufficiently high that a significant and steady supply of gas could be supplied to the inner nuclei .",
    "this is because , unlike ms+ms collisions , collisions between ms stars and wds do not require very high relative velocities to ablate the star @xcite .",
    "the wd is sufficiently compact that , upon penetrating the star , a shock wave is sent through it , increasing the temperature in the outer layers by roughly an order of magnitude .",
    "this in turn triggers cno burning , which liberates enough energy to unbind most of the envelope .",
    "the collision of a wd with a massive ms star is hence disruptive , with the energy source unbinding the ms star being due only in small part to the kinetic energy of the non degenerate star @xcite .",
    "thus , ms+wd collisions can supply gas to the nucleus independent of its velocity dispersion , which sets the typical relative velocity at infinity for direct collisions . in the mw and m31 ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we emphasize that ms+ms collisions should contribute little to the total gas supply in the nuclei in our sample .",

    "observationally , unresolved binaries should broaden the color distribution ( at a given magnitude ) along the inferred main - sequence , relative to a coeval population of single stars . with that",
    "said , our results presented in section  [ bmkl ] suggest that the time - scales for kozai - lidov oscillations to operate are sufficiently short very close to a central smbh that all binaries with initially high inclinations should merge on relatively short time - scales , leaving both binaries and merged binaries in young nuclear environments .",
    "to summarize , our results suggest that collisions could offer an additional pathway toward re - fueling an inner nucleus with gas for recent star formation .",
    "ms+wd collisions could contribute significantly to the total gas supply needed to form the centrally concentrated blue stars in every nuclei in our sample , with the possible exception of m32 and perhaps m33 ( due to a relatively small stagnation radius for gas inflow / outflow ) . in nearly all cases , the relative velocities are not high enough to ablate the stars during ms+ms collisions , except within the inner @xmath0 0.1 pc of the m31 nucleus where the velocity dispersion reaches @xmath0 1000km / s . here , however , ms+ms collisions could also offer an additional source of gas for star formation , as originally suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "during ms+wd collisions , on the other hand , the relative velocity at impact plays only a minor role in deciding how much gas is liberated .",
    "this is because the strong surface gravity of the wd is primarily responsible for generating the high temperature shock front that triggers explosive cno burning in the ms star , as opposed to the kinetic energies of the objects at impact ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "if the envelope of an rgb star is stripped , the hot core is revealed and the star settles onto the extreme horizontal branch in the cluster colour - magnitude diagram before dimming to join the white dwarf cooling sequence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if only a single grazing collision occurs , only a small fraction of the rgb envelope should end up unbound . although the photometric appearance of the resulting rgb star can still be slightly affected by a single mass loss episode",
    ", our results presented in section  [ ehbform ] suggest that almost all of the rgb envelope must be stripped before its subsequent evolution and photometric appearance are significantly affected , which should require multiple collisions .",
    "it is not clear how many ms+rgb collisions are needed for an rgb star to be collisionally stripped by ms stars to the point of forming an hot ehb star .",
    "the number could range from on the order of 10 to hundreds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the relevant rate here is that for a _ specific _ rgb star to undergo collisions with ms stars ( i.e. figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) , which is lower than the rate for _ any _ rgb star to undergo collisions by a factor n@xmath86 , where n@xmath86 is the total number of rgb stars .",
    "the rates of ms+rgb collisions are sufficiently high in only the inner @xmath1 0.1 pc of m31 and m32 that this mechanism could potentially produce ehb stars ( and hence a paucity of rgb stars ) in the inner nuclear regions . given that the ehb lifetime is only on the order of 10@xmath26 years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , it seems unlikely that any observed blue excess is due to ehb stars , since the implied rate of ehb formation must be unrealistically high .",
    "although bhs are expected to be able to remove a larger fraction of the envelope on a per encounter basis @xcite , figure  [ fig : fig3 ] suggests that only in perhaps m33 could the rate of bh+rgb collisions be of comparable significance to ms+rgb collisions for removing rgb envelopes .",
    "a deficit of late - type giants can perhaps be looked for observationally using the presence or absence of co bandhead absorption to distinguish late - type from early - type stars ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "blue straggler stars are rejuvenated main - sequence stars , identifiable in the cluster colour - magnitude diagram as being brighter and bluer than the main - sequence turn - off @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in m31 , m32 and m33 ,",
    "the rate of ms+ms collisions is sufficiently high to supply , in as little as a few gyrs or less , a total mass in ms+ms collision products that is a significant fraction of the total mass of the inner nuclear regions , and could thus contribute non - negligibly to the observed light distribution . with the exception of m33 ,",
    "the relaxation times of the nscs in our sample tend to be on the order of a few gyr or more @xcite .",
    "this is longer than the expected age of a typical collision product formed from an old population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it follows that mass segregation of collision products formed at larger radii into the inner nuclear regions should have only a minor impact on deciding the observed numbers of collision products here .    with",
    "that said , any tension due to an over - abundance of predicted bss can perhaps be reconciled by the fact that the products of direct ms+ms collisions should be puffed up post - collision due to the deposition of kinetic energy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this increases the collisional cross - section and reduces the time - scale for subsequent collisions , which could act to strip the collision product of its inflated envelope .",
    "this would serve to reduce the acquired mass in collision products .",
    "the envelope should contract on a kelvin - helmholtz time - scale , which can be comparable to the time for subsequent collisions to occur .",
    "finally , we note that more massive collision products should have shorter lifetimes , which reduces their probability of actually being observed .",
    "if bss are produced abundantly , then we might naively also expect an over - abundance of rgb stars , since the heavier bss should evolve onto the giant branch on shorter time - scales than the rest of the ms population . as explained in the next section",
    ", these evolved bss might be rapidly destroyed via ms+rgb and wd+rgb collisions , however we do not expect this to be the case in the mw and m33 . and yet , in the mw nsc , table  [ table : one ] suggests that , over a 1 gyr period , we expect on the order of 10@xmath104 ms+ms collisions in the inner @xmath0 2 pc .",
    "although this is only a small fraction of the total number of rgb stars , this excess is nonetheless puzzling in the mw nsc , since a paucity of giants has been observed , not an excess ( but see the last paragraph in section  [ mw ] ) .    very roughly , the rates of 1 + 2 collisions are sufficiently high in every nsc in our sample that most primordial binaries should have been destroyed by the present - day ( with the exception of m33 ) .",
    "it follows that our assumed binary fractions could be over - estimates , in spite of correcting for the fraction of hard binaries using the observed velocity dispersion .",
    "more importantly , this suggests that not enough binaries should be present to contribute significantly to bs production via either binary coalescence or binary mass - transfer .",
    "only those binaries born in a near contact state have sufficiently small cross - sections ( i.e. near contact ) to survive for @xmath2 1 gyr .",
    "this is because the orbital separation corresponding to the hard - soft boundary is near contact in nuclei with such high velocity dispersions .",
    "for very close binaries near contact , the probability of a merger or direct collision occurring during a 1 + 2 interaction approaches unity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , most direct 1 + 2 encounters that do not result in a direct stellar collision should be dissociative , or at least widen the binary and reduce the time - scale for a subsequent ( likely dissociative ) encounter to occur .",
    "it follows that the rate of direct 1 + 2 encounters should be approximately equal to the rate of binary destruction very early on in the cluster lifetime .",
    "for those few near contact binaries that are able to survive for the bulk of the cluster lifetime , if stable mass - transfer is initiated then mass , energy and angular momentum conservation dictate that the binary orbit should ( eventually ) widen , significantly increasing the geometric cross - section and reducing the time - scale for a direct 1 + 2 encounter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , if unstable mass - transfer is initiated , then a common envelope could form , which would also ( at least temporarily ) increase the geometric cross - section for collision and reduce the 1 + 2 collision time .",
    "thus , we expect that the very few bss that might form from binary mass - transfer should quickly lose their binary companions post - formation , due to dissociative or destructive 1 + 2 encounters @xcite .",
    "the simple calculations performed here should be verified and better quantified in future studies , using more realistic binary fractions and distributions of binary orbital parameters .",
    "finally , we consider one additional mechanism for bs formation , which has not yet been considered .",
    "this is the accretion of significant amounts of gas from the interstellar medium ( ism ) onto a normal old ms star .",
    "the gas could be supplied to the ism by ms+wd and even ms+ms collisions ( if the velocity dispersion is very high , which is the case in only m31 and only in its inner @xmath1 0.1 pc ; see section  [ sf ] ) , and/or mass loss from evolving stars in the surrounding old population .",
    "the gas collects at the tidal truncation radius ( if an smbh is present ) due to the focusing of gas particle orbits in an axisymmetric potential @xcite .",
    "this gas is then channeled inward on a viscous time - scale , where we are assuming it is accreted by old main - sequence stars already orbiting there . as discussed by @xcite for a similar scenario , as the gas density builds up , feedback from stars can serve to stop fragmentation of the gas , while accretion onto pre - existing old stars could proceed at very high rates .",
    "although this scenario requires an initial old and centrally - concentrated stellar population to provide the seeds for accretion , it is appealing since it ultimately requires a much smaller gas reservoir than the recent burst of star formation scenario , while also avoiding the special conditions required to induce the fragmentation of a giant molecular cloud in such an extreme environment so close to an smbh .",
    "we caution that more work needs to be done to quantify the expected accretion rates in this scenario , which are poorly known .",
    "thus , accretion onto pre - existing old ms stars also predicts an inner disk of blue stars in the m31 , m32 and m33 nuclei , assuming that the accretion rates of the ism onto the old stars are sufficiently high .",
    "this mechanism is also appealing in that , unlike a recent burst of star formation , it is a _ continuous _ mechanism for rejuvenating old ms stars .",
    "indeed , we might naively expect the mean bs mass ( and hence luminosity ) for bss formed from this mechanism in the inner nucleus to correlate with the age of the surrounding old population , since older stars will have had longer to expel their winds into the ism , and to accrete the polluted material .",
    "this mechanism also predicts low binary fractions , a very low central mass - to - light ratio and ( possible ) surface abundance spreads throughout the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , depending on the quantity and composition of the accreted material .",
    "we conclude that all nuclei in our sample should harbour an abundance of blue stragglers , formed mostly from ms+ms collisions .",
    "accretion onto old ms stars already orbiting in the inner nuclear regions offers an additional possible pathway toward bs formation .",
    "our results suggest that the rates of ms+wd collisions are sufficiently high to contribute significantly to the gas reservoir required for this mechanism to explain the observed blue stars .",
    "these `` non - binary mass transfer bss '' should have properties tightly correlated with those of the underlying old stellar population .      as illustrated in table",
    "[ table : one ] , our results predict non - negligible numbers of collision products formed over only a 100 myr interval that can be a significant fraction of the total number of stars in the nuclear cluster . to help distinguish blue stars formed via collisions from young stars and test for a true age gradient in a given nsc , particular attention can be put into deriving the radial dependence of the collision rate as a function of the host cluster environment .",
    "the collision number profiles can be converted into corresponding surface brightness profiles , and from there into radial colour profiles .",
    "these collisional colour profiles can then be subtracted from the observed colour profiles , after multiplying the collisional colour profiles by an appropriate constant to ensure that no over- or under - subtraction occurs  the normalization should be applied at large radii , or where the predicted collision rates are at their lowest .",
    "if any residual colour gradient is present , this suggests that its origin is a recent burst of star formation .",
    "if no residual colour gradient remains and the u - v or u - b colours turn out to be approximately constant as a function of distance from r @xmath21 0 , then the observed colour gradient is indeed consistent with a collisional origin .",
    "this test can be performed on the local group nuclei when future observations with superior resolution capabilities become available and , in particular , more accurate velocity information .",
    "a number of collisional mechanisms considered in this paper could contribute to the appearance of a colour gradient , and should be accounted for when looking for a true age gradient . in every nucleus in our sample ,",
    "our results predict non - negligible numbers of ms+ms collision products , or blue stragglers . in the inner @xmath1 0.1 pc of m31 and m32 ,",
    "the collision rates are sufficiently high that individual rgb stars could undergo multiple collisions within 100 myr .",
    "if this were to result in a paucity of rgb stars and a corresponding excess of single ehb stars , then the contribution of rgb - stripping to observed colour gradients is two - fold ; the loss of rgb stars reduces the total amount of red light and the production of ehb stars can increase the total amount of blue light .",
    "thus , the stripping of rgb stars could also contribute to the appearance of an age gradient , provided the numbers of ms+rgb , wd+rgb and bh+rgb collisions are extremely high and centrally concentrated .",
    "finally , we note that future studies considering age gradients in nearby galactic nuclei should include the local group dwarf spheroidal galaxy ngc 205 , which is known to harbor bright blue ( and possibly young ) stars .",
    "we have not done so in this paper , since the rate of collisions is expected to be much lower than in the other nscs in our sample @xcite , due to a lower central surface brightness .",
    "the key point to take away from equation  [ eqn : taukl ] is that , for any binary within a distance r@xmath139 from the centre of the galaxy with a sufficiently large angle of inclination relative to its orbital plane about the smbh ( i.e. i @xmath2 40@xmath140 ) , the kozai - lidov time - scale is much shorter than the cluster age , for any old ( i.e. @xmath2 a few gyrs ) stellar population .",
    "for example , for a binary with a separation of 1 au and component masses of 1 m@xmath9 on a circular orbit about the smbh with a semi - major axis equal to the scale radius of the nucleus , the kozai - lidov time - scale given by equation  [ eqn : taukl ] is 4.8 @xmath7 10@xmath13 , 1.0 @xmath7 10@xmath106 and 1.5 @xmath7 10@xmath4 years in , respectively , the mw , m31 and m32 .",
    "we also calculate the critical distance r@xmath139 from the smbh beyond which kozai - lidov oscillations are suppressed by general relativistic precession .",
    "this is 0.04 pc , 0.15 pc and 0.04 pc for , respectively , the mw , m31 and m32 .",
    "these kozai - lidov time - scales are significantly shorter than the ages of the surrounding old stellar populations , as well as the collision times presented in section  [ app ] .",
    "it follows that , over sufficiently long time - scales ( much shorter than the cluster age ) , the rate of binary mergers due to kozai - lidov oscillations should be determined by the time - scale for single stars to scatter the binary orbital plane ( and reduce the distance from the smbh to @xmath1 r@xmath139 ) into the active kozai - lidov domain .",
    "vector resonant relaxation acting to re - orient the binary orbital plane could contribute to either an increase or decrease in this rate ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "regardless , in all nuclei in our sample , the rate of direct 1 + 2 collisions is sufficiently high relative to the age of the old stellar population that only very compact binaries should survive to the present - day , since the hard - soft boundary is near contact in these galactic nuclei due to their high velocity dispersions and the collision probability for a direct encounter with small impact parameter is close to unity for such compact binaries @xcite .",
    "the collision product should expand after the encounter by a factor of a few ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , causing it to merge with its binary companion nearly independent of the semi - major axis or expansion factor .",
    "this is the case in every nsc in our sample , with the exception of m33 due to its lower velocity dispersion .",
    "if the binary progenitors are destroyed , then kozai - lidov oscillations can not operate .",
    "therefore , we do not expect binary mergers due to kozai - lidov oscillations to have contributed significantly to any of the anomalous blue star populations currently observed in the inner regions of the ( old ) nscs in our sample of galaxies . although the mass segregation timescale for a massive population can approach the cluster age in the nscs in our sample , heavy objects could still have been delivered via this mechanism to the inner nuclear regions in non - negligible numbers by the present - day ( provided they are born at sufficiently small clustercentric radii ) .",
    "bh - bh binary mergers induced by kozai - lidov oscillations with the central smbh could still be relatively high at the present epoch relative to the rates of stellar binary mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , these bh - bh binaries should either be primordial or have formed very far out in the nsc and only recently migrated inward .",
    "this is because the rate of _ stellar _ binary destruction is expected to be very high .",
    "if few binaries exist at the present epoch , then bhs can not be exchanged in to them via dynamical encounters to form bh - bh binaries . additionally , due to the presence of the massive central bh",
    ", bh binary formation via tidal capture can be unlikely since the timescale for this is comparable to the timescale on which the bh binary will experience a strong encounter with the central smbh and itself be stripped of its companion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to estimate the numbers of x - ray binaries using our derived collision rates ( i.e. the number of dynamically formed x - ray binaries ) , we need to know the fractions of stellar remnants , namely white dwarfs f@xmath141 , neutron stars f@xmath142 and black holes f@xmath143 . unfortunately , these numbers are highly uncertain , due to uncertainties in the initial stellar mass function at the high - mass end ( which are significant ) , neutron star kicks at birth which can eject them from the nucleus , etc .",
    "regardless , we can make general comments about the expected frequencies of x - ray binaries in our sample of nuclei , which is also highly sensitive to the cluster binary fraction f@xmath44 . based on our results for the 1 + 2 collision rates",
    ", we expect very few binaries to have survived until the present - day .",
    "this is due both to the high 1 + 2 collision rates , but also to the separations corresponding to the hard - soft boundaries in such high velocity dispersion environments , which are near contact . with this in mind",
    ", it seems more likely that the nuclei with the lowest velocity dispersions should harbor the largest binary fractions , namely m32 and m33 , which have hard - soft boundaries of 0.04 au and 0.6 au , respectively . in both m32 and m33 ,",
    "the 1 + 2 collision rates are also the highest , such that exchange encounters should occur very frequently .",
    "thus , we might expect a larger fraction of cataclysmic variables , ns and bh x - ray binaries as well as millisecond pulsars ( msps ) in the inner nuclear regions of m32 and especially m33 , relative to the mw and m31 which are home to more hostile environments for long - term binary survival in the inner @xmath1 1 pc . with that said , @xcite recently showed ( which was subsequently confirmed by @xcite ) that the presence of a massive black hole near the cluster centre can efficiently destroy x - ray binaries , lowering their numbers significantly relative to what would be predicted in the absence of a massive bh .",
    "thus , putting this all together , we expect m33 to have the largest fraction of x - ray binaries per unit cluster mass , since it has both the lowest velocity dispersion and the smallest upper limit on the smbh mass",
    ". indeed , constraining the formation of x - ray binaries in the m33 nucleus could help to place constraints on the possible presence of a central bh , which remains controversial and is at best , of very low mass ( i.e. @xmath1 1500 m@xmath9 ) .",
    "finally , we note that various processes not considered in our study may effectively replenish the nuclear regions of galaxies with binaries and compact objects , possibly enhancing the formation of x - ray binaries and msps in nscs . for example",
    ", nuclear stellar clusters may result from the continuous infall of star clusters that disrupt close to the smbh ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such stellar clusters may harbor msps , x - ray binaries as well as large populations of stellar remnants .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggest that the disruption of triple stars could leave behind a binary in a close orbit around an smbh ; the rate of triple disruptions ( brought in to the inner nuclear regions at late times either via nsc infall or mass segregation ) could be high enough to serve as a continuous source of binaries close to the smbh .",
    "in this paper , we consider the origins of the enigmatic stellar populations observed in the nuclear star clusters of local group galaxies , specifically the milky way , m31 , m32 and m33 .",
    "these curious populations are blue stars found in the inner @xmath1 0.1 pc of three out of the four galactic nuclei considered here .",
    "the origins of these centrally - concentrated blue stars are not known .",
    "several candidates have been proposed in the literature , including blue straggler stars , extended horizontal branch stars and young recently formed stars . here ,",
    "we calculate rough order - of - magnitude estimates for various rates of collisions , as a function of the host nuclear cluster environment and distance from the cluster centre .",
    "we subsequently quantify the contributions to the enigmatic blue stars from bss , extended horizontal branch stars and young recently formed stars .",
    "the collision rates are sufficiently high that blue stragglers , formed via direct collisions between single main - sequence stars , could contribute non - negligibly ( @xmath0 1 - 10% ) to the observed surface brightness profiles , in nearly ( with the exception of the mw ) every nucleus in our sample .",
    "however , the radial profiles of the collision products do not always predict a strong central concentration of these objects , as in the mw ( for our assumed density profile , which has a constant density core ) , m32 and , to a lesser extent , m31 . in m31 and m32 ,",
    "the rates of ms+rgb collisions might only be sufficiently high for individual giants to undergo multiple collisions within @xmath1 0.1 pc from the galaxy centre . only here",
    "could a paucity of giants be observed , since the results of stellar evolution models presented in this paper suggest that the envelope must be nearly fully stripped to destroy an rgb star and leave an ehb star in its place .",
    "the rates of collisions between white dwarfs and ms stars , which are expected to typically ablate the ms stars , are sufficiently high that this could offer a steady supply of gas to the inner nucleus and subsequently contribute non - negligibly to the total gas reservoir needed to seed star formation in every galactic nucleus in our sample .",
    "this scenario seems the most likely ( dominant ? ) of those considered in this paper for explaining the origins of the inner blue stars , relative to a direct collisional origin .",
    "however , we suggest that the gas might be more likely to simply accrete onto pre - existing old stars rather than fragment and form new stars . this could offer a new channel for bs formation or the rejuvenation of old ms stars , by creating `` non - binary mass transfer blue stragglers '' in the inner nucleus .",
    "we emphasize , however , that more work needs to be done to better constrain the expected accretion rates in this scenario , which are poorly known .",
    "our results suggest that collisional processes could contribute significantly to the observed blue excesses in m31 and m33 , via several different channels .",
    "more sophisticated theoretical models are needed , however , in order to properly compliment existing and future observations .",
    "for example , accurate collision surface brightness profiles , which can be derived from theoretical collision number profiles ( such as those presented in this paper ) , can be converted into radial colour profiles , multiplied by a suitable constant ( to ensure not under- or over - subtracting ) and subtracted from the observed radial colour profiles .",
    "any remaining colour gradient observed in the residuals should then be indicative of a real age gradient in any high - density unresolved stellar population .",
    "we caution that this method is best suited to quantifying only the _ gradient _ in an observed age spread , and not the relative sizes of the underlying blue and red populations .",

    "<S> we consider the origins of enigmatic stellar populations in four local group galactic nuclei , specifically the milky way , m31 , m32 and m33 . </S>",
    "<S> these are centrally concentrated blue stars , found in three out of the four nuclear star clusters ( nscs ) considered here . </S>",
    "<S> their origins are unknown , but could include blue straggler ( bs ) stars , extended horizontal branch stars and young recently formed stars . here , we calculate order - of - magnitude estimates for various collision rates , as a function of the host nsc environment and distance from the cluster centre . </S>",
    "<S> these rates are sufficiently high that bss , formed via collisions between main sequence ( ms ) stars , could contribute non - negligibly ( @xmath0 1 - 10% in mass ) to every surface brightness profile , with the exception of the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> stellar evolution models show that the envelopes of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars must be nearly completely stripped to significantly affect their photometric appearance , which requires multiple collisions . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the collision rates for individual rgb stars are only sufficiently high in the inner @xmath1 0.1 pc of m31 and m32 for rgb destruction to occur . </S>",
    "<S> collisions between white dwarfs and ms stars , which should ablate the stars , could offer a steady and significant supply of gas in every nsc in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> the gas could either fragment to form new stars , or accrete onto old ms stars already present . </S>",
    "<S> thus , collisional processes could contribute significantly to the observed blue excesses in m31 and m33 ; future studies should be aimed at better constraining theoretical predictions to compliment existing and future observational data .    </S>",
