    "on analyzing the simulated chemical potential profile in 1-d as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chempot_divorced ] , it is apparent that a divorced morphology forms due to the incorporation of partitioned carbon ( at the advancing @xmath6 transformation front ) into the existing cementite particles .",

    "an intermittent coarsening regime sets in before the pulling away of the @xmath6 interface from cementite particles . in order to provide a detailed exposition of this newly identified regime ( which is not clearly visible in fig .",

    "the cementite particles are labeled as 1 and 2 . on comparing the 1-d chemical potential profiles for two different simulation time - steps ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , we find that a change in the carbon redistribution mechanism is stimulated which leads to coarsening of particles prior to the divorce from the growth front .    to begin with , the @xmath6 transformation front advances and forms an interface with the adjacent cementite particle 1 .",
    "as a result of this interaction , particle 1 starts to grow due to the incorporation of partitioned carbon primarily via the interface ( transformation front ) diffusion flux .",
    "it is noteworthy , that the particle 1 which shares a common interface with ferrite experiences a greater influx of partitioned carbon as compared to particle 2 , since the interface diffusivity is assumed to be 1000 times faster than the diffusion in austenite in all the present cases . as the diffusion fields of both the cementite particles overlap , particle 1 grows while the particle 2 shrinks , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : analysis_coarsening](a ) and [ fig : analysis_coarsening](c ) . at this stage ,",
    "the driving force for coarsening predominates over the growth .",
    "the same is also reflected [ fig .",
    "[ fig : analysis_coarsening](a ) ] by a temporal increase in the curvature of @xmath40 interface of particle 1 which slowly approaches infinity and subsequently curves inwards .",
    "an advancement of @xmath6 transformation front towards particle 2 causes a shift in the carbon redistribution mechanism again ; the driving force for cementite growth exceeds coarsening .",
    "we attribute a reduction in the distance between @xmath6 transformation front and particle 2 which makes the incorporation of partitioned carbon feasible at smaller distances via bulk diffusion flux . as a result ,",
    "the chemical potential near the advancing @xmath6 front ascends leading to the growth of particle 2 .",
    "this change in the carbon redistribution mechanism which results in predominance of growth over a coarsening regime is evident from the 1-d plot shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : analysis_coarsening](b ) .",
    "it is worth clarifying that the  concurrent growth and coarsening \" regime ( denoted by ` c ' ) reported in the present work principally differs from the particle coarsening in alloys which has been extensively reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "although , the reported regime ` c ' does involve curvature driven coarsening of particles , the primary difference with the phenomena of conventional coarsening is attributed to the energetics of @xmath45 phase triple - junction which determines if the transformation proceeds by a cooperative ( to yield lamellar pearlite ) or by a non - cooperative regime ( yielding divorced eutectoid ) .",
    "further , the accompanying eutectoid transformation modifies the effective curvature of @xmath40 interface of particle ` a ' which increases the rate of coarsening as depicted by a decline in normalized radius of particle b shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : analysis_coarsening](b ) .",
    "it can be argued that the reported regime holds a close resemblance with the discontinuous coarsening of grain boundary precipitates which could result in the formation of precipitate free zone ( pfz ) along prior austenite grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "however , on a careful examination , it is apparent that the physics of temporally evolving interphase interfaces which is reported in the present study is not only different , but also more complex when compared to the grain boundary interfaces involved in discontinuous coarsening .",
    "temperature govern the switching among the three numerically simulated modes . ,",
    "scaledwidth=30.0% ]    having numerically simulated and comprehended the ipseity of the concurrent growth and coarsening regime which precedes the non - cooperative eutectoid transformation , we construct a lamellar - divorced - coarsening ( ldc ) transition map as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot_ldc ] to summarize the parametric study .",
    "the ldc transition map generated by conducting phase - field simulations for three different undercoolings ( 5 , 7.5 and 10 k ) below the eutectoid temperature and initial particle spacings predicts the morphology that is favored for a given set of initial conditions during an isothermal transformation . in a nut - shell ,",
    "the most significant contribution of the work presented in the current letter is the addition of an alphabet ` c ' ( acronym for concurrent growth and coarsening regime which is favored at smaller spacing and lower undercooling ) to the classical lamellar - divorced ( ld ) map @xcite .",
    "further , the present numerical findings are also in complete agreement with the existing theory for the divorced to lamellar morphological transition ; lamellar morphology being more favorable at large spacings and high undercooling .",
    "in conclusion , the spacing of the cementite particles embedded in the austenite matrix as well as undercooling below the eutectoid temperature entirely determines the final microtructure .",
    "an in - depth phase - field study of the isothermal transformation presented in this article , aids in selection of parameters to tailor the eutectoid microstructure appropriately .",
    "the present approach also captures the important transition between lamellar and divorced morphologies and sheds light on the change in carbon redistribution mechanism which is primarily governed by initial configuration of the phases .",
    "the concurrent growth and coarsening regime is identified for the first time which may be fundamentally difficult to isolate in experiments .",
    "thus , the present numerical studies provide new insights into the transformation mechanism and amend the classical model of eutectoid transformation .    in future , it will be interesting to study the influence of asymmetrical arrangement of cementite particles on the final eutectoid morphologies .",
