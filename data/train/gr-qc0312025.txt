    "+    the energetic description of a particular evolution of the medium @xmath7 by the energy tensor @xmath3 , consists , and only consists , of the specification of the _ energy density _ @xmath8 , the _ energy flow density _ @xmath9 and the _ stress tensor _ @xmath10 of this evolution of @xmath7 in @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , the energetic description by @xmath11 _ does not explicitly contain _ the physical characterization of the medium , that is , the specification of its molecular components .",
    "thus , a given divergence - free energy tensor @xmath12 could describe the particular evolution of more than one medium .",
    "in other words , the sets @xmath13 and @xmath14 of all possible unconstrained evolutions of two mediums @xmath7 and @xmath15 are not necessarily disconnected as the diagram of figure 2 shows .",
    "+     +    on the other hand , divergence - free energy tensors @xmath16 may be generated theoretically in many ways , which may or may not correspond to particular evolutions of a physical medium .",

    "finally , in section 4 , as a further application , we shall present the necessary and sufficient conditions for a perfect fluid to be an _",
    "ideal gas_.    the proof of all our statements will be given elsewhere @xcite , where we will present a deeper analysis of the ideas related to the `` physical meaning '' of perfect fluids .",
    "as described above , the set @xmath3 of energy tensors associated in @xmath2 to a fluid @xmath7 gives the energetic description of the set of unconstrained evolutions that correspond to the different _ initial configurations _ that the fluid may adopt . as a consequence ,",
    "it is _ meaningless _ to try to find a physical interpretation to a perfect fluid energy tensor @xmath16 in @xmath2 submitted to the sole divergence - free condition .",
    "the reason is that the system @xmath33 is not causal , so that not only one energy tensor corresponds to every initial configuration , but a partially arbitrary family of such tensors , which include arbitrarily advanced - retarded - like solutions as well as maxwell s demonds - like perturbations of the physical evolution @xcite . in order to select a physical ( causal ) evolution",
    ", one has to complete the above system conveniently @xcite .",
