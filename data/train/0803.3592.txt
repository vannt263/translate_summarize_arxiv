    ", @xmath3 also has a representation as a product @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the roots of  @xmath3 .",
    "the fact that there are two ways of looking at polynomials provides possibilities that are hidden by their apparent simplicity .",
    "in this paper we look at two different polynomials which have equally spaced zeros , and we study the zeros of their derivatives .",
    "we will see that euler s famous result @xmath6 is lurking in the background , as are some generalizations of euler s result .",
    "our proof that @xmath7 appears to be new , and it does nt use anything more than is typically covered in a second semester calculus course .",
    "the first polynomial we will consider is the degree @xmath8 polynomial with simple zeros at @xmath9 .",
    "that is , @xmath10 we will write @xmath11 instead of @xmath12 to simplify the notation .",
    "the question we will obtain a partial answer to is : where are the zeros of the derivative @xmath13 ?    by rolle",
    "s theorem , we know that @xmath14 has a zero in each of the intervals @xmath15 , @xmath16,  ,@xmath17 . those zeros account for @xmath18 of the zeros of @xmath14 , which is all of the zeros because @xmath14 has degree  @xmath18 . we are left with the question : where in those intervals @xmath15,  ,@xmath17",
    "are the zeros of @xmath14 ?",
    "suppose more generally that @xmath3 is a polynomial with only real zeros .",
    "there is a common misconception , reinforced by looking at small degree examples and badly drawn graphs , that the zeros of @xmath19 should be located close to the midpoint between neighboring zeros of  @xmath3 .",
    "a more accurate guide is the following :    zeros of @xmath19 try to move away from the zeros of  @xmath3 .",
    "what the principle says is : when @xmath19 decides where to put a zero , it looks around to see what zeros of @xmath3 are nearby . if it sees a bunch of zeros of @xmath3 to the right , it will try to shift the zero of  @xmath19 to the left , and vice - versa .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : zfunction ] , which shows part of the graph of a high - degree polynomial .",
    "[ 1.3 ] , and the dots are the zeros of  @xmath19 .",
    "the zeros of @xmath3 push the zeros of @xmath19 away from the midpoints.,title=\"fig : \" ]    let s focus on the interval @xmath15 for the polynomial @xmath11 given above .",
    "since there are many zeros to the right , and only one zero to the left , the repulsion principle says that @xmath14 will shift the zero to the left , so the zero will be closer to 0 than to 1 .",
    "the question is : how close ?",
    "we answer that question in the next section .    the repulsion principle , not by that name ,",
    "is discussed extensively in our paper  @xcite .",
    "this principle explains , for example , the observation in  @xcite that the smallest zero of @xmath19 is closer to the smallest zero of @xmath3 than to the next - smallest zero .",
    "the specific case of the polynomial  @xmath20 is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "any attempt to find a simple formula for the location of the first zero of @xmath14 will fail for two reasons .",
    "first , there is no simple formula for the derivative  @xmath14 .",
    "we discuss this difficulty in the next section .",
    "second , there is no closed form expression for the zeros of an arbitrary high degree polynomial , so even if we had a nice formula for @xmath13 it might not do us any good .      to see the difficulty of finding a formula for @xmath13 ,",
    "first consider the product representation  . to differentiate a product of @xmath8 things",
    ", you have to use the product rule @xmath18 times .",
    "the result will be a sum of @xmath8 terms , where each term is an @xmath18-fold product .",
    "the entire expression is quite unwieldy .",
    "since differentiating a sum is easier than differentiating a product , we can try multiplying out   to write @xmath11 as a sum : @xmath21 a few of the coefficients are easy to find . for example , @xmath22 because @xmath23 , which we see by substituting @xmath24 in the product .",
    "it is not too hard to see that  @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "a couple more coefficients can be described as simple formulas , but there is no known closed formula for all of the coefficients .",
    "these coefficients come up in a variety of situations and are know as the _ signed stirling numbers of the first kind_. we have @xmath27 in the usual notation for the stirling numbers .",
    "since , there is no simple formula for @xmath28 , differentiating   does not give a useful expression . for more information about the stirling numbers , see chapter  6 of  @xcite .",
    "since the product form of @xmath29 is difficult to differentiate , and the sum form is easy to differentiate but has unusable coefficients , what can we do ?",
    "the answer is : take logarithms ! since the @xmath30 of a product is a sum , we have @xmath31 note : here `` @xmath30 '' means natural log , the function that calculator manufacturers and nonmathematicians call `` @xmath32 '' .    differentiating the above expression",
    "we obtain `` the logarithmic derivative '' of  @xmath29 : @xmath33 this is useful because the solutions to @xmath34 are the same as the solutions to @xmath35 except possibly at the points where @xmath36 .",
    "however , we are trying to understand the solution to @xmath34 which is between @xmath37 and  @xmath38 , so we have the following equivalent problem : find the solution to @xmath39 which satisfies @xmath40 .",
    "we will not find an exact expression for that solution , but we will find a good approximation .",
    "in this section we work informally and make things more precise in the following sections    let @xmath41 denote the solution to @xmath34 with @xmath42 . as described in the previous section , we must solve @xmath43 since solving   is the same as finding a root of an @xmath18th degree polynomial , we should not expect to find an exact formula for @xmath41 , except maybe for small  @xmath18 . instead , we will look for an approximation .",
    "recall that the repulsion principle told us that @xmath41 is close to zero , so in   the term @xmath44 is much larger than the rest .",
    "so we will rearrange to put @xmath44 by itself : @xmath45 since @xmath41 is close to @xmath37 , the right side of   will be close to the _ @xmath18th harmonic number _ :",
    "@xmath46 we give more information about the harmonic numbers in the next section , but for now just recall that @xmath47 is approximately @xmath48 .",
    "thus , @xmath49 so , @xmath50 , and we see that , for large @xmath18 , @xmath41 is actually quite close to  @xmath37 . in particular , @xmath41 is not close to the midpoint between the first two zeros .",
    "the above calculation is informal and we do not intend to convey a precise meaning with the `` approximately '' symbol `` @xmath51 '' . we will do the calculation rigorously in the next section .",
    "we make precise the argument in the previous section , and find that it touches on many combinatorial and number - theoretic objects that have been widely studied . in our approximation to the first root of @xmath13 we will encounter euler s constant @xmath52 and the riemann zeta function @xmath53 then in section  [ sec : zeta(2 ) ] we will differentiate another polynomial in order to evaluate @xmath54 , and in section  [ sec : zeta(2n ) ] we evaluate the zeta function at the even integers .",
    "that calculation will involve the bernoulli numbers , the stirling numbers , and the eulerian numbers .    to give a precise estimate for @xmath42 , the first root of @xmath14 , we need two facts .",
    "first , the geometric series @xmath55 which can be manipulated to give @xmath56 as @xmath57 .",
    "second , @xmath58 here @xmath52 is euler s constant , @xmath59 .",
    "equation   is the _ definition _ of euler s constant , but it appears in many other places , such as the laurent series for the riemann - zeta function : @xmath60 there is a whole book on this interesting number  @xcite .",
    "we have    [ alphaapprox ] if @xmath42 is a root of @xmath61 then @xmath62 so @xmath63    the only fact we will use about @xmath41 is that @xmath42 , so in particular @xmath64 .",
    "start with equation , and use equation   with @xmath65 , and  : @xmath66 that gives the first equation in the theorem . to obtain the second ,",
    "take the reciprocal of both sides and use with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we started with the assumption @xmath42 and found an approximation for @xmath41 with an error term @xmath69 . by feeding this into an almost identical calculation ,",
    "we can obtain an even better approximation to  @xmath41 .",
    "[ alphaapprox2 ] if @xmath42 is a root of @xmath61 then @xmath70 so @xmath71    euler proved that @xmath72 in the proof below we will only use the fact that @xmath73 which follows from @xmath74    again we start with equation and use equation  , this time with @xmath75 , and  .",
    "we have @xmath76 the last step used the fact that @xmath77 converges . on the final line above , replace @xmath41 by @xmath78 and @xmath79 by @xmath80 , both of which follow from theorem  [ alphaapprox ] .",
    "since @xmath81 this establishes the first formula in theorem  [ alphaapprox2 ] .",
    "the second formula follows in exactly the same way as the second formula in theorem  [ alphaapprox ] .",
    "it is clear that we could use the result in theorem  [ alphaapprox2 ] , feed it back into equation  , and obtain an even more precise formula for  @xmath41 . repeating",
    "this process would establish that @xmath82 where the @xmath83 are polynomial expressions in @xmath52 and @xmath84 .",
    "for the first few @xmath83 we have @xmath85    in the next section we use a different polynomial , but which also has equally spaced zeros , to prove euler s result  @xmath7 .",
    "the previous section we considered polynomials with equally spaced zeros on the real line . in this section",
    "we consider polynomials with equally spaced zeros on the unit circle .",
    "that is , @xmath87 .",
    "if we set @xmath88 then the zeros of @xmath89 are at the @xmath18th roots of unity : @xmath38 , @xmath90 , @xmath91,  ,@xmath92 .",
    "thus , @xmath93 here @xmath94 refers to a set of representatives of the integers modulo  @xmath18 .",
    "this is legitimate because @xmath95 has period  @xmath38 .",
    "later we will use the specific choice @xmath96 .",
    "we now use the polynomial @xmath89 to evaluate @xmath54 . as in the previous section , we begin with the logarithmic derivative of  @xmath97 . since we are trying to prove an identity , in this case we will make use of both the product and the sum representation of the polynomial . taking the _ second _ derivative of the logarithm of   we obtain @xmath98 various formulas can be obtained by plugging in specific quantities for @xmath99 in the above equation .",
    "it is tempting to plug in @xmath100 , which is possible if one first moves the @xmath101 term to the left side and simplifies .",
    "equivalently , start over with the polynomial @xmath102 .",
    "instead , we will plug in @xmath103 , a @xmath104th root of unity , which is motivated by noting that the left side will become fairly simple .    multiplying",
    "both sides of that equation by @xmath105 and plugging in @xmath103 we have    we have @xmath106    the remainder of the calculation closely parallels the treatment in the previous section : we want to expand the denominator of the right side of as a series .",
    "using the taylor series for @xmath107 one can check that for @xmath108 we have @xmath109 the restriction on @xmath110 is due to the fact that @xmath111 for integral  @xmath110 .",
    "we will only need the first term in that expansion .",
    "since is only valid for @xmath108 we are forced to make the specific choice @xmath112 for the representatives of the integers modulo  @xmath18 . making this choice and then applying the taylor expansion   we obtain @xmath113    dividing both sides by @xmath114 and rearranging",
    ", we have @xmath115 letting @xmath116 and replacing @xmath117 for @xmath118 , we obtain @xmath119 this is equivalent to euler s result @xmath120 because letting @xmath121 we have the following lemma .    [ zeta_odd ] for @xmath122 , @xmath123    @xmath124    now solve for @xmath125 .    therefore by  , @xmath126    note that substituting @xmath127 , @xmath128 , into   and applying the same manipulations as above gives @xmath129 from this one can produce results analogous to euler s , but where the sum is over an arithmetic progresion .    in the next section",
    "we generalize the method to evaluate the zeta - function at the positive even integers .",
    "the same calculations as above with a little more book keeping allow us to compute @xmath130 for all positive integers @xmath131 .",
    "this general result was known to euler and there are many proofs of it . to state the result we need to introduce the bernoulli numbers .",
    "the bernoulli numbers @xmath132 for @xmath133 are defined as the coefficients of the taylor series for @xmath134        we provide a proof of theorem  [ thm : zeta(2n ) ] by differentiating the polynomials @xmath137 in two different ways . in each case",
    "we will have an expression involving recursively defined constants that are well known combinatorial objects .",
    "using a couple of identities for these numbers and letting @xmath18 tend to infinity we will be able to evaluate @xmath130 .",
    "as in the calculation of @xmath54 , we will see that taking the logarithm of our polynomial before differentiating will allow us to express things in a useful way .",
    "however , unlike that calculation we will not simply take the derivative .",
    "instead of repeatedly applying the operator @xmath138 we apply the operator @xmath139 . we will refer to this as `` differentiation , '' where the quotes indicate that we are applying @xmath139 instead of @xmath138 .",
    "we wish to apply @xmath140 many times to the function @xmath141 to understand high `` derivatives '' of the right hand side we will consider the high `` derivatives '' of the function @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a complex number .",

    "it is true for @xmath153 .",
    "assuming it is true for for all @xmath154 , with @xmath155 , we have @xmath156 the first step follows by the induction hypothesis and the final step follows by the definition of the @xmath144",

    "we wish to prove that @xmath167 we will obtain a recursion for @xmath168 and then using that recursion we will find a recursion for its coefficients , @xmath158 .          in propositions",
    "[ diff rhs ] and  [ diff lhs ] we introduced two sets of numbers @xmath172 and @xmath173 , and those numbers satisfied particular recursion formulas .",
    "it turns out that those numbers are related to other famous numbers from combinatorics : stirling numbers of the second kind and the eulerian numbers .",
    "the stirling numbers of the second kind @xmath174 count the number of ways to partition a set of @xmath131 elements into @xmath175 nonempty subsets .",
    "they can be described recursively by @xmath176 and the recursion @xmath177 on the other hand , the eulerian number @xmath178 is the number of permutations of the numbers @xmath38 to @xmath179 in which exactly @xmath180 elements are greater than the previous element .",
    "the eulerian numbers are given recursively by @xmath181 and @xmath182 for @xmath183 , and @xmath184 it is the recursive definitions which we will make use of .",
