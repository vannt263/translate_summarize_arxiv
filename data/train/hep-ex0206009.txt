    "recently the technical design report ( tdr ) for the superconducting linear collider tesla  @xcite has been completed .",
    "a possible detector as laid out in the tdr will have to deal with a large dynamic range in energy , complexity of final states and signal - to - background ratio .",
    "in particular , the detector should be able to cover the following important physics goals :    * very good momentum resolution ( @xmath1 in the central region ) to measure e.g. the z recoil mass in the higgsstrahlung process @xmath2@xmath3 with optimal precision ; * high resolution of hadronic jet energies ( @xmath4 ) to reconstruct multi - jet events ; * excellent b- and c - tagging capabilities to identify multi - b final states like zhh or @xmath5h and to separate @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; * good hermiticy to reduce background in missing energy channels ; and * measurement capabilities in the forward direction .",
    "the detector version implemented in ` simdet ` is based on the description of the detector for the tesla linear collider as presented in part iv of the tdr  @xcite .",
    "it has been optimised for the physics requirements mentioned above .",
    "its basic components are :    * a multi - layer micro - vertex detector ; * a tracker system with the main tracker as a large time projection chamber ( tpc ) , a silicon tracking subsystem between the vertex detector and the tpc and a set of forward chambers behind the tpc endplates ; * a tracking electromagnetic calorimeter with very fine three dimensional granularity ; * a hadronic calorimeter ; * and an instrumented mask with a small - angle luminosity detector .",
    "[ tesla_detector ] shows the principal layout of the tesla detector and its dimensions . the tracking system and the calorimeters are situated inside a 4 t superconducting solenoid .",
    "at tesla a bunch train of @xmath8 2800 bunches with more than 300 ns spacing makes bunch identification easy and no special detectors are needed for this purpose .",
    "background expected is mostly due to @xmath2pairs created in beam - beam interactions produced at the interaction point ( ip ) .",
    "these pairs are concentrated at low polar angle and low transverse momentum . in order to absorb background related to low - angle pairs",
    "a mask in the forward direction is required which is also used for calorimetry .",
    "the pairs at large angles can be kept at low radius by a strong magnetic field .",
    "it limits the radius of the innermost vertex detector layer to 1.5 cm which ensures an acceptable background level .",
    "the program ` simdet ` simulates the response of this detector for linear collider physics in a fast and user - friendly manner .",
    "the main objectives of the program are threefold :    * it provides physics studies groups with a tool for evaluation of the physics potential of a linear collider ; * it treats the detector responds in a realistic manner using a parametrisation of results from the _ ab initio _",
    "monte carlo program ` brahms ` ; * it is fast and provides a simple output structure , so that physics studies can be done in a straight forward and decentralised way .",
    "only the _ ab initio _ geant3  @xcite application program ` brahms `  @xcite provides detailed and realistic information for charged particle momenta and directions , impact parameters and calorimeter energies and directions .",
    "simple parametrisations of their resolution functions are used as input for ` simdet ` .",
    "gaussian smearing procedures then generate the detector response .",
    "starting from version 3 of the program , a more accurate description of the calorimeter response has been derived from ` brahms ` and a major upgrade of the program was the implementation of an energy flow algorithm to link tracker and calorimeter information . for this purpose ,",
    "a simple and idealistic cluster algorithm is applied to the energy deposits in the calorimeters .",
    "clusters and tracks are then linked to form energy flow objects .",
    "the ultimate pattern recognition is emulated using a complete cross reference between the calorimeter deposits and the particles originally generated .",
    "energy flow objects are then classified as electrons , photons , muons , charged and neutral hadrons and clusters of unresolved particles using the monte carlo truth information . also , if enabled , the covariance matrix for charged particles and @xmath0 information are made available to the user .",
    "a new design of the instrumented mask and a low - angle luminosity calorimeter have been included into the default option of the detector , so that the program is significantly enhanced as far as flavour and particle identification capabilities and large angle coverage are concerned .",
    "the identification of a technology for the muon system has yet to be explored in a comprehensive way .",
    "the program ` simdet ` has been prepared for muon response simulation . at present , however , muons are assumed to be measured by the tracking device and identified applying a general misidentification probability .",
    "the objects produced by the energy flow algorithm provide a consistent data structure at the output of the program .",
    "this data structure , as well as defined user hooks inside the program itself , can be used to perform physics studies either within ` simdet ` or by means of an analysis program after writing the energy flow objects to a file .",
    "furthermore , beamstrahlung based on parametrisations of ref.@xcite can be included , @xmath9hadronic background events can be overlayed to physical events  @xcite and an event display for reconstructed objects has been prepared  @xcite . recently ,",
    "a ` clic ` version of the program was initiated  @xcite to study the physics potential of an @xmath2  linear collider in the center - of - mass energy region of 3 tev and beyond .",
    "the anticipated particle physics program at tesla , presented in detail in part iii of the tdr  @xcite , represents a very demanding task for the detector . with such a detector the sensitivity for discovery and very high precision measurements over energies from the z peak up to @xmath8 1 tev should be as large as possible , withstanding at the same time the background expected . in this section",
    "we describe the response of the individual tesla detector components as implemented in the present version of ` simdet ` .",
    "ongoing and planned r&d activities for possible improvements or redesigns of detector components are not considered in this note and have to be accounted for in forthcoming ` simdet ` versions .",
    "the concept of the tracking system is shown in fig .",
    "[ tesla_tracker ] .",
    "excellent tracking of charged particles is achieved by a large time projection chamber ( tpc ) as a main tracker , supplemented by a silicon tracking detector between the vertex detector ( vtx ) and the tpc , by discs in the forward region and by a forward chamber located behind the tpc endplate ( fch ) .",
    "the tpc design is similar to existing ones , as implemented in the aleph or star detectors .",
    "so as to not to compromise the momentum resolution and the calorimetric energy measurement , field cage and endplates will be designed as thin as possible .",
    "a tpc error of @xmath10 for large polar angle tracks and @xmath11 are anticipated .",
    "the intermediate tracker consists of two layers of silicon strip detectors ( sit ) in the barrel region down to @xmath12 and three silicon pixel and four silicon strip layers ( ftd ) on either side in the forward region of the detector .",
    "single point resolutions of 10 @xmath13 respectively 50 @xmath13 are assumed in the simulations for these detectors .",
    "the fch , sit and ftd improve significantly the momentum resolution for all polar angles and , in particular , the angle measurement capability in the very forward region below @xmath14 .",
    "for the microvertex detector several technologies were proposed : ccds , active pixel sensors ( aps ) and cmos sensors . with the ccds a point resolution of 3.5 @xmath13 and a layer thickness of 0.12 @xmath15 of a radiation length can be reached . at present ,",
    "the ccd detector version has been implemented in detail in the simulation program ` brahms ` .",
    "consequently , the same information is represented in ` simdet ` .    using the overall tracking system , resolution functions for the inverse of the transverse momentum , polar and azimuthal angles as well as impact parameters as functions of momentum and polar angle @xmath16 are input to gaussian smearing procedures .",
    "interpolating between data points and extrapolation to not yet simulated regions , reasonable descriptions in the whole @xmath17)-plane have been obtained .",
    "attention has been paid to ensure that the parametrised resolutions are in agreement within a few percent with the ` brahms ` predictions .",
    "the inverse transverse momentum , the directions @xmath16 and @xmath18 and the impact parameter resolution parameters are smeared independently .",
    "correlations between momenta and @xmath18 directions of tracks are neglected .",
    "an example of the ` brahms ` simulated resolution functions for 20 gev momentum tracks are shown in fig .",
    "[ tesla_track_resol ] as a function of polar angle .",
    "the measured values thus obtained for 1/@xmath19 and @xmath18 can be transformed to @xmath20 and @xmath21 by means of the program package described in ref .",
    "@xcite , including proper propagation of the measurement errors .    `",
    "simdet ` offers to set a minimum transverse momentum for tracks , so that below that value charged particles are removed from the event . tracking efficiency and charge misinterpretation probability",
    "can also be specified .",
    "the track reconstruction efficiency is momentum dependent : it equals the ( default ) data card value for tracks with momentum above 2 gev and becomes continuously smaller with decreasing track momentum .",
    "charge misinterpretation according to the ( default ) data card value is only applied to large @xmath22 tracks ; this value is increased by a factor of three for badly measured particles .",
    "no attempt is currently made to take into account overlaps of closely spaced tracks .",
    "[ tesla_track_resol ]    the main element entering in the lifetime tagging is the impact parameter .",
    "the impact parameter in the @xmath23 plane is defined as the minimal distance between the primary vertex ( pv ) and the track trajectory projected onto the plane perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "the point of closest approach ( @xmath24 ) of the track trajectory to the primary vertex in the @xmath23 plane is also used to define the @xmath25 projection of the impact parameter .",
    "then the @xmath25 projection of the track impact parameter is the difference between the z - coordinates of the primary vertex and the point @xmath24 .",
    "both impact parameters have a sign defined as follows .",
    "the point of closest approach of the track to the simulated flight direction is computed and the negative ( positive ) sign is set if this point is upstream ( downstream ) with respect to the primary vertex position . with this definition ,",
    "tracks from decays of long - lived particles have predominantly positive signs while tracks coming directly from the pv are equally likely to be positive or negative due to the limited precision of track reconstruction .    for the ccd version of the vertex detector , all necessary input for",
    "sophisticated flavour identification exists in the form of a parametrised covariance matrix .    for the aps version of the vertex detector , geant3 simulations provide the impact parameter errors as follows :",
    "@xmath26    for a track with momentum p and polar angle @xmath16 in the @xmath23 and the @xmath25 projections .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 were obtained from ` brahms ` simulations and transmitted to ` simdet ` .",
    "the physics programme at a linear collider calls for calorimetry with unprecedented performance which can be translated into the following requirements :    * hermeticity down to very small angles , * excellent energy resolution for jets respectively partons , * excellent angular resolution , * capability to reconstruct non - pointing photons as a stand - alone device , * good time resolution , to avoid event pile - up .",
    "dense and hermetic sampling calorimeters with very high granularity realise at best these demands . in the tdr ,",
    "two options are presented both for the electromagnetic ( ecal ) and the hadronic ( hcal ) calorimeter components . for the ecal ,",
    "the two options are a very high granularity 3d calorimeter based on tungsten and silicon diode pads and a shashlik ( scintillator / lead ) calorimeter as presented in the cdr  @xcite .",
    "both versions have undergone a successful r&d program , detailed layout studies and careful implementations into the simulation program ` brahms ` .    for the hcal , the two suggestios are an fe / scintillating tile calorimeter with fine transverse and longitudinal segmentations and a fully digital calorimeter , which represents a novel approach to hadronic calorimetry .",
    "it consists of fine pixels ( 1@xmath31 ) for an iron / gas sandwhich that is read - out digitally ( yes / no ) for each cell .    in version 4 of ` simdet ` , the tungsten / silicon option for the electromagnetic component and the fe / scintillating tile option for the hcal are implemented .",
    "the simulation of the calorimetric response to hadrons and leptons has been updated to correspond more closely to the expected performance of the tesla calorimeters as described in the technical design report .",
    "the excellent energy resolutions for single electrons and photons at high energies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : egamres ] , the energy resolution for hadrons in fig .",
    "[ fig : hadres ] .",
    "both resolution curves have have been determined using _ ab initio _ simulations of the baseline electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters as implemented in ` brahms ` .",
    "they agree well with the resolutions quoted in the tesla technical design report@xcite .",
    "these resolution curves are implemented in the current version of ` simdet ` .    on the other hand ,",
    "no attempt has been made to simulate the benefits expected from the extremely fine three - dimensional granularity of the silicon tungsten calorimeter .",
    "consequently , also the subsequent cluster algorithm sticks to the simple two - dimensional tower geometry used in the previous version of the program .",
    "users who require a more accurate simulation of the spatial energy deposit or more sophisticated pattern recognition in the calorimeters should directly use ` brahms ` for their study .",
    "the energy flow output implemented in the present version of ` simdet ` which was left unchanged with respect to version 3  @xcite , thus does not fully benefit from the superb pattern recognition capabilities of the tracking calorimeter . nevertheless , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : eflow ] , usage of the energy flow concept leads to a vast improvement in the reconstruction of the visible and missing energy .",
    "the standard calorimeters ecal and hcal are completed by forward calorimeters , which cover polar angles down to 4.6 mrad .",
    "these calorimeters , despite their small size , have a large impact on the overall detector performance , since they enhance missing energy resolution , provide electron / photon identification and measure single bunch luminosity .",
    "the low angle tagger ( lat ) is designed at the tips of the tungsten mask with a @xmath16 coverage down to @xmath830 mrad and serves as an additional shield to protect the tracking detectors from backscattered particles .",
    "its design foresees a tungsten sampling calorimeter .",
    "it is supported by an inactive tungsten structure . `",
    "brahms ` simulations assume radial and azimuthal segmentations for this device . the background expected from @xmath2beamstrahlung pairs is comparatively small , so that the lat can probably be used for ( electron , photon ) and muon identification and measurement .",
    "the low angle calorimeter ( lcal ) serves both as a fast luminosity monitor and as a low angle calorimeter .",
    "the current design foresees a sampling calorimeter with segmentation in the @xmath32 direction and azimuthal subdivision .",
    "it has to withstand a high level of electromagnetic radiation , yet render accurate energy and angular resolutions . in fig .",
    "[ tesla_lat_lcal ] the placement of the two calorimeters in the mask structure is shown .",
    "[ tesla_lat_lcal ]    the expected performance of the lat has been studied using ` brahms ` responses for high energy electrons and muons .",
    "energy and @xmath16 resolution functions for these particles were parametrised and the parameters obtained are implemented in ` simdet ` . also , detection efficiencies as functions of energy and polar angle are taken into account .",
    "since no charge information exists , electrons and positrons are interpreted as objects with unknown charge and treated as photons .",
    "closely spaced @xmath33 , @xmath34 and photons are merged to a new energy flow object , while muons with sufficient energy are considered to be isolated and are given a random charge . `",
    "simdet ` allows to overwrite the default energy and angular resolution parameters as well as the minimum energy needed for particle detection .    for the lcal we expect from existing ` brahms ` simulations that only @xmath35 and photons will be measurable with energy and polar angle dependent probabilities .",
    "the resolutions expected for energetic particles in light of intense backgrounds are taken into account in ` simdet ` .",
    "all measured lcal objects are interpreted as photons , since charge information is missing .",
    "accounting for some minimum energy deposits it seems possible that the detector allows electron measurements with more than 50 gev down to polar angles of 5 mrad .",
    "since the lcal is at present only in a stage of preliminary design , the current ` simdet ` response simulation is simple and accounts only for relative restricted information from the full monte carlo program ` brahms ` .",
    "the @xmath0 simulation is based on the bethe - bloch equation which is a universal function of @xmath36 for all particle species .",
    "the expected @xmath0 for a track is generated according to its mass and momentum using the bethe - bloch equation with parameters derived from the opal jet chamber .",
    "then , the expected mean is smeared by an error that depends on the number of isolated samples , on the sampling length and on the error of the sampling length that results from the uncertainty of the track polar angle @xmath16 .",
    "parameters of the @xmath0 error description are based on a study with a dedicated monte carlo simulation  @xcite where individual electrons and clusters have been generated and tracked to the tpc endplate including diffusion , gas gain fluctuations and crosstalk .",
    "the @xmath0 code provides for the electron , muon , pion , kaon and proton hypothesis five signed weights of range -1 to + 1 .",
    "the five weights are the signed @xmath37 probabilities of a track being consistent with a certain particle species .",
    "the sign of the weight corresponds to the sign of the difference @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the @xmath0 value according to the bethe - bloch equation and @xmath40 is the expected @xmath0 smeared with the appropriate error .",
    "the @xmath37 probabilities also include the track momentum error and are calculated by minimising the following two - dimensional variable :    @xmath41 + the signed weights also allow the conversion into equivalent normalised @xmath0 pull values . for particle identification purposes either",
    "the `` probability frame '' might be used where cuts on @xmath0 weights are placed or the `` normalised @xmath0 frame '' could be used where cuts on some standard deviations are placed . however , there is no general preference for one or the other framework as both are fully equivalent .    please note that the five @xmath0 weights in general do not necessarily add up to one . for two different particle species , at a certain momentum , the expected @xmath0 values from the bethe - bloch equation are identical and indistinguishable . at this cross - over point ,",
    "the probabilities for both particle hypotheses are exactly equal to one .",
    "the expected particle separation power depends on the amount of the isolated samples available per track .",
    "usually tracks are imbedded in dense track environments ( multi - hadronic jets ) , which reduce the number of samples significantly due to the limited double track resolution of the tpc .",
    "the program ` simdet ` allows to estimate the amount of overlap regions for each track by means of two - particle separation distances in the @xmath23 and @xmath25 projections . since each track",
    "is compared with all others , speed of computation can be governed by a step size parameter and the possibility to cut - off the comparison of tracks after a certain number of consecutive space points taking into account the spread - out of charged particles within the magnetic field .",

    "monte carlo simulation package * brahms*. the energy distributions of electrons and charged pions in adjacent cells were fitted and the parameters obtained are used for appropriate energy deposite simulations in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters ( subroutine * silego * and subroutine * sidepo * ) .",
    "afterwards , a cluster search algorithm ( with some idealised assumptions ) provides clusters ( subroutine * siclus_i * ) in the ecal as well as the hcal .",
    "finally , an energy flow algorithm ( subroutine * siflow_i * ) joins tracker and calorimeter informations such that as many single particles as possible are resolved . at this stage , the best estimate for charged particles is simply taken from the tracker , except for high energy electrons and positrons . here ,",
