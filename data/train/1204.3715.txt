    "wettability is a long - standing issue primarily addressed by looking at the angle of contact at the edge of the interface between a liquid and a solid ( sessile droplet method ) @xcite . in spite of the simplicity of the formulation of the problem ,",
    "this procedure is at the basis of many investigations devised to assess the behavior of a liquid or a material in a number of industrial processes and applications ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , and it has been demanding valuable efforts , both experimental and theoretical @xcite .",
    "computer simulations provide useful guidelines for their power to deal with the complexity of large assemblies of interacting components . in classical molecular dynamics studies ,",
    "the systems are described at the molecular level according to the laws of classical mechanics and electrodynamics .",
    "for these reasons , this approach proves to be both versatile and accurate .",
    "recent breakthroughs have triggered a burst of interest in the properties of graphene @xcite .",
    "promising applications in a variety of fields could indeed develop .",
    "our interest in graphitic materials is related to their optimal dispersion in polymeric matrices for the best manufacturing of composite materials @xcite . in that respect ,",
    "the wetting properties of graphitic surfaces by water are of course the starting point of any subsequent investigation .",
    "in particular , the transition to the macroscopic limit is essential for any further study adopting more advanced modelization schemes @xcite .",
    "our analysis of profiles differs from the well - established method @xcite in that we approximate them by a more general curve than a circle .",
    "this way of proceeding is especially necessary for small droplets , exhibiting the largest deviations from the predictions of young equation and from a spherical cap .",
    "this last aspect has already been recognized in previous studies @xcite . yet",
    ", we also propose an analytic expression for the oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function of water .",
    "all molecular dynamics simulations are performed with lammps @xcite , a code that supports parallelization optimally @xcite .",
    "numerical integration is accomplished with the algorithm rrespa , allowing to deal with multiple time step sizes @xcite .",
    "we choose a time step of @xmath3 [ fs ] for non - bonded interactions and of @xmath4 [ fs ] for bonded interactions .",
    "all lennard - jones forces are evaluated with a potential of the type 12 - 6 .",
    "the in - built charmm force field @xcite is employed to prevent van der waals interactions from decaying abruptly at the cutoff distance : the forces are smoothly corrected to zero from @xmath5 to @xmath6 [  ] .",
    "pairwise coulomb interactions within a distance of @xmath6 [  ] are calculated in the real space and beyond this value with a particle - particle , particle - mesh method ; the precision is set to @xmath7 .",
    "the pairwise interactions among atoms separated by one or more bonds are neglected .",
    "the neighbor lists are always updated at every time step .",
    "these general settings are always applied , unless specified otherwise .      throughout our work",
    "we use for the water the spc / fw model introduced in ref .",
    "we address the reader to this detailed study for the definitions ( partial charges , equilibrium distances , interaction parameters , etc . ) .",
    "we start from @xmath8 molecules of water arranged regularly in a cubic box of side length @xmath9 [  ] with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we let the system evolve for @xmath10 [ ps ] in the ensemble npt ( nos - hoover integration ) .",
    "this simulation is performed as equilibration with a single time step size of @xmath4 [ fs ] .",
    "the target temperature and pressure are @xmath11 [ k ] and @xmath4 [ atm ] , respectively .",
    "since the main purpose is to reproduce experimental densities , we choose the parameters that control the convergence so as to fix the temperature and the volume , while we still let the pressure fluctuate .",
    "it is in fact well - known that the pressure is a very sensitive function of the volume and difficult to equilibrate accurately @xcite .",
    "we then let the system evolve for other @xmath12 [ ns ] at nve conditions ; the final configuration of this dynamics is replicated and used to obtain the droplets of water .",
    "all starting configurations are formed by two parallel planes of graphene and a semisphere of molecules of water .",
    "the planes of graphene are separated by @xmath13 [  ] with the lower one translated by the vector @xmath14 with respect to the first ; @xmath15 [  ] is the length of the bonds among the carbon atoms .",
    "the two planes are approximately squared with side of at least @xmath9 [  ] larger than the diameter of the semisphere .",
    "the semisphere is centered above the planes of graphene at a distance of @xmath16 [  ] from the upper plane .",
    "the boundaries are periodic and two images of the droplets are separated by at least @xmath17 [  ] in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "the mass of the carbon atoms is @xmath19 [ g / mol ] .",
    "the water and the graphene interact via van der waals forces between the atoms of carbon and oxygen with force field parameters @xmath20 [ kcal / mol ] and @xmath21 [  ] @xcite .",
    "the system is equilibrated for @xmath12 [ ns ] in the ensemble nvt ( nos - hoover thermostat ) with the temperature of the water maintained at @xmath11 [ k ] .",
    "the system is studied during a further evolution of @xmath4 [ ns ] in the microcanonical ensemble by gathering frames at every @xmath12 [ ps ] .",
    "the density of water is calculated using the formula @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the total number of atoms and @xmath24 is the volume in @xmath25 of the cubic domain resulting from the preliminary simulation of equilibration . by using this formula the result",
    "is expressed in g / cm@xmath25 .",
    "the oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function @xmath27 is defined by @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the average number of oxygen atoms in a shell of width @xmath30 at a distance @xmath31 from a given oxygen atom .",
    "we choose @xmath32 [  ] and of course @xmath27 is unitless .",
    "we also calculate the cumulative probability @xmath33 , which yields the fraction of oxygen atoms within a distance @xmath31 from a given atom of oxygen .",
    "@xmath34 is the number of shells per unit length .",
    "( by writing the above integral as a discrete sum , that sum would run over the number of shells . )",
    "the contact angle @xmath35 is defined by the tangent at the contact line , the edge of the interface between the solid and liquid phases ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : profile ] ) .",
    "the contact angle of a macroscopic droplet with spherical symmetry is well described by the equation @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37 s are the surface / interfacial tensions .",
    "the subscripts s , l and v stand for solid , liquid and vapor , respectively .",
    "the above relation is generally referred to as young equation @xcite . especially for small droplets ,",
    "young equation needs a corrective term that accounts for the line tension , leading to @xmath38 .",
    "as the notation suggests , @xmath39 is young equation , which yields the contact angle @xmath40 in the macroscopic limit .",
    "@xmath41 is the radius ( or curvature ) of the contact line and @xmath42 is the line tension .",
    "if @xmath43 , we speak about hydrophilic behavior ; hydrophobic if @xmath44 .",
    "complete wetting corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "the discussion of the contact angle is much richer than what reported here .",
    "a more detailed treatment can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to obtain the profile of the droplets , it is applied the method explained in refs .",
    "@xcite with @xmath46 [ @xmath25 ] .",
    "typically , the contact angle is extracted by superimposing a circle on the profile coming out from the simulations . the center and the radius of the circle",
    "are obtained by a fit .",
    "here we have decided to proceed in a quite different way .",
    "indeed , there appears that the circle departs from the shape of the droplets in particular for the smallest ones where the contact angle is calculated , because its radius of curvature is weaker .",
    "we thus approximate the profile of the droplets by a piecewise linear function .",
    "the idea is to subdivide the profile into small elements . for the points falling within an element",
    ", we calculate the average values for both @xmath48 and @xmath49 coordinates .",
    "these average values are the usual parameters used in linear regressions .",
    "the contact angle is calculated from the slope of the linear function obtained by a linear regression on the average points above the contact line at most @xmath50 [  ] .",
    "the contact line point is assumed to be at @xmath51 .",
    "the contact area is simply given by @xmath52 ; the contact line is @xmath53 .",
    "the overall interfacial surface of the droplets is calculated by means of the formula @xmath54 and their volume with @xmath55 .",
