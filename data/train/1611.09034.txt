    "over the past decades , the field of quantum molecular dynamics has been driven by the development of efficient numerical methods for solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "current applications include studies of quantum optimal control  @xcite or electron dynamics .",
    "the two basic tasks that need to be addressed in quantum molecular dynamics are the representation of the state vector ( and operators acting on it ) and its time evolution .",
    "ideally , the accuracy with which both tasks are accomplished should be balanced  @xcite .",
    "high accuracy is required by many state - of - the - art applications , for example in quantum optimal control  @xcite . at the same time , the exponential scaling of quantum dynamics calculations is a challenge for even the most advanced computer architectures .",
    "efficiency of the methods is therefore also an issue , in addition to accuracy .",
    "highly accurate methods are obtained by employing pseudospectral approaches based on the expansion in orthogonal polynomials  @xcite .",
    "the representation problem can be solved using discrete variable representations or their unitary equivalent , finite basis representations  @xcite .",
    "the operators acting on the wavefunction are then given as sparse ( often diagonal ) matrices in one of the representations .",
    "the numerical effort is either due to the unitary transformation connecting the two representations or due to sparse matrix - vector multiplications . for a sufficiently large number of basis functions ,",
    "the error becomes smaller than machine precision  @xcite .",
    "polynomial approximations yield also the most accurate and stable propagation schemes  @xcite .",
    "again , convergence is exponential with increasing polynomial order . for coherent time evolution ,",
    "the best polynomial approximation of the evolution operator is obtained by the chebyshev propagator  @xcite , while newton polynomials yield an accurate and efficient propagator for open quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "modifications of polynomial propagators allow to also accurately account for time ordering in case of a time - dependent hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the high accuracy of these methods may , however , be compromised in time - dependent studies of dissociation or ionization where a sufficiently large grid , respectively a sufficiently large number of basis functions , becomes computationally prohibitive , both in terms of storage requirements and cpu time .",
    "remedies to this problem include the use of variable grid steps  @xcite or variable - grid boundary conditions  @xcite , wavefunction splitting methods  @xcite , mask functions  @xcite or complex absorbing potentials ( caps )  @xcite .",
    "while the latter approach allows for calculating physical observables that require long propagation times  @xcite , a cap can only absorb wavepacket components within a certain frequency range  @xcite .",
    "it is thus rather difficult to completely avoid reflection which compromises accuracy .",
    "the problem of reflection also occurs for the mask function approach  @xcite .",
    "a cap , moreover , renders the hamiltonian non - hermitian , which results in substantial technical difficulties for quantum optimal control  @xcite and may even preclude the evaluation of observables of interest  @xcite .",
    "non - hermitian hamiltonians are avoided when using variable grid steps or wavefunction splitting but also in these cases high accuracy and reasonable numerical costs are not always guaranteed .",
    "for example , the mapped fourier grid method  @xcite was developed for long - range potentials that vanish asymptotically as @xmath0 .",
    "it allows for an accurate description of most bound states and low - energy scattering states .",
    "however , the calculation of the bound spectrum does not scale favorable with the number of grid points , rendering its application in coupled channel calculations difficult  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can not be used in photoionization studies where high - energy scattering states may come into play .",
    "wavefunction splitting is applicable in this case  @xcite ; it neglects , however , the coulomb interaction between photoion and photoelectron .",
    "thus , it can not be used to study processes where recombination of the photoelectron is crucial , such as high harmonic generation . here , we use a weak formulation  @xcite of the schrdinger equation to derive a sparse , yet accurate representation of the hamiltonian and combine it with the chebyshev propagation method  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to decompose the spatial domain into multiple sub - intervals of increasing size , chosen according to the local de broglie wavelength , similar to the choice of the variable grid step in the mapped fourier grid method  @xcite . within each interval",
    ", the wavefunction is expanded into lagrange polynomials .",
    "the resulting representation of the hamiltonian is sparse which is exploited in storage , diagonalization and matrix - vector operations  @xcite .",
    "our approach thus combines the high accuracy of pseudospectral methods with the ability to use a very large spatial domain .",
    "it is particularly advantageous for quantum dynamics involving long - range potentials and long propagation times . as an example",
    ", we consider a laser - driven electron in a soft coulomb potential , a popular model for high - harmonic generation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] presents the method , starting with a brief review of the chebychev propagator .",
    "the pseudospectral multi - domain representation of the hamiltonian is derived from the weak formulation of the schrdinger equation in section  [ subsec : weak ] . within each domain ,",
    "a gauss - lobatto - legendre collocation is employed , as described in section  [ subsec : colloc ] , and a global representation of the hamiltonian is derived in section  [ subsec : global ] by assembling all domains . in section iii",
    ", we present and compare numerical results between the mfgh and the mfgh - sem .",
    "section iv is devoted to time dependent results . finally , summarizing remarks",
    "are outlined in section v.",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation reads @xmath1 where the hamiltonian , @xmath2 may contain a time - dependent term .",
    "the formal solution is given by @xmath3 polynomial propagators expand the evolution operator , @xmath4 , as a function of the hamiltonian , in a truncated polynomial series  @xcite .",
    "to this end , the domain of the eigenvalues , i.e. , the spectral radius of the hamiltonian @xmath5 , must be known .",
    "consider the example of a time - independent hamiltonian in which case the chebychev propagator is simply obtained as @xmath6 since the complex chebyshev polynomials are defined in the interval @xmath7 $ ] , the hamiltonian must be renormalized , @xmath8 the expansion coefficients @xmath9 are known analytically  @xcite and the chebyshev polynomials can be computed using their recursion formula .",
    "the solution is thus obtained by subsequent applications of the ( renormalized ) hamiltonian to a wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "for a prespecified error , the number of chebyshev polynomials , i.e. , the number of times the hamiltonian is applied to a wavefunction , is determined by the product of spectral radius @xmath5 and time step  @xcite . if the hamiltonian has a matrix representation , the propagation involves a series of matrix - vector multiplications , @xmath10 .    here , we derive a sparse representation of the hamiltonian  .",
    "it is based on domain decomposition  @xcite , the variational or weak solution  @xcite of the schrdinger equation , lagrange interpolation  @xcite , and polynomial series expansions of operators  @xcite .",

    "correspondingly , we can evaluate the integrals in eq .   by means of a gaussian quadrature rule within each interval @xmath16 ,",

    "moreover , a useful expression to evaluate the first term in eq .  , needed to construct the matrix representation of the kinetic operator in the schrdinger equation , is given by @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",

    "since @xmath77 , this can simply be done by adding the multi - domain bilinear forms defined in eqs .  , @xmath78 provided that the correct boundary conditions are ensured at the intersection of two contiguous elements ,    [ eq37 ] @xmath79    continuity and differentiability of the global solution need to be enforced since the global cardinal basis , defined as @xmath80 , is not differentiable at the @xmath81 interelement points .",

    "thus , when adding the bilinear forms for all intervals @xmath16 , the interelement boundary conditions cancel out , as desired .",
    "analogously to eq .   for the bilinear forms , we introduce the global interpolant @xmath86 as @xmath87 then , just as the basis set expansion of @xmath31 , eq .  , has led to @xmath20 algebraic equations within the interval @xmath16 , eq .",
