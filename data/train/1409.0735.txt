    "transport properties in nuclear matter contribute to the determination of the equation of state via the underlying in - medium properties of the nuclear interaction and are one of the fundamental ingredients for microscopic models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "they are also critical in the description of the supernova core collapse and the formation of a neutron star @xcite .",
    "these properties can be probed with the help of heavy - ion induced collisions ( _ hic _ ) by looking at dissipation phenomena in terms of energy and isospin transport and thus related to the stopping . in the fermi energy domain",
    ", transport features should exhibit the interplay between mean - field ( nuclear degrees of freedom ) and individual ( nucleonic degrees of freedom ) effects , especially when looking at the energy dissipation reached in central collisions @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view , the knowledge of the dissipation mechanism for nuclear matter in hic is related to the properties of the mean - field itself via the 1-body dissipation ( nuclear friction and viscosity ) and nucleon - nucleon ( _ nn _ ) collisions via 2-body dissipation in the nuclear medium .",
    "in the studied energy range , below @xmath1 a , only _ nn _ elastic channels must be considered . at low incident energy _",
    "i.e. _ lower than the fermi energy , where mean - field effects prevail , _ nn _ collisions are strongly suppressed due to the fermionic nature of nucleons , known as pauli blocking . at high incident energy , while the available space for _ nn _ collisions increases , the situation is the opposite since the mean - field becomes less and less attractive while _ nn _ collisions become important @xcite .",
    "then , one expects the in - medium _ nn _ cross section to be very small at low incident energy and to become sizeable ( asymptotically approaching the _ free _ _ nn _ cross section ) as the incident energy becomes significantly higher than the fermi energy . in this framework , one may wonder what is the magnitude of in - medium effects induced by many - body correlations in nuclear reactions .",
    "numerous theoretical approaches show that the cross section has to be properly renormalized in order to account for the _ effective _ _ nn _ collision rate in _ hic _ @xcite and several effects must be considered .",
    "first , the pauli blocking effect discussed above reduces the _ nn _ collision rate @xcite and can be viewed as a `` trivial '' two - body correlation due the quantal nature of protons and neutrons .",
    "higher - order correlations in _ nn _ collisions due to the high- density conditions encountered in central collisions @xcite can also come into play as shown in some theoretical works done in the past two decades @xcite .",
    "they mainly use relativistic mean - field approaches with realistic ( effective ) nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "they conclude that the in - medium _ nn _ cross sections are isopin - dependent , and have to be renormalized ( reduced ) in the nuclear medium as compared to free vacuum values .",
    "they show that the nucleon mean free path is large , typically larger than the nucleus size for @xmath7 , and decreases toward a saturation value @xmath8 at high incident energy , for @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "thus , the situation at high energy , where the mean free path is supposed to be almost constant , is quite clear .",
    "this is not the case in the fermi energy domain ; indeed , in - medium effects and especially quenching factors for the _ nn _ cross section are largely unknown in the range @xmath10 @xcite and have to be constrained experimentally .    from an experimental point of view , nuclear stopping has been determined by the _ fopi _",

    "<S> we study nuclear stopping in central collisions for heavy - ion induced reactions in the fermi energy domain , between @xmath0 and @xmath1 a. using the large dataset of exclusive measurements provided by the @xmath2 array _ indra _ , we determine the relative degree of stopping as a function of system mass and bombarding energy . we show that the stopping can be directly related to the transport properties in the nuclear medium . by looking specifically at free nucleons ( here protons ) , </S>",
    "<S> we present for the first time a comprehensive body of experimental results concerning the mean free path , the nucleon - nucleon cross - section and in - medium effects in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the mean free path exhibits a maximum at @xmath3 , around @xmath4 a incident energy and decreases toward an asymptotic value @xmath5 at @xmath6 a. after accounting for pauli blocking of elastic nucleon - nucleon collisions , it is shown that the effective in - medium _ nn _ cross section is further reduced compared to the free value in this energy range . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in - medium effects can not be neglected in the fermi energy range . </S>",
    "<S> these results bring new fundamental inputs for microscopic descriptions of nuclear reactions in the fermi energy domain . </S>"
