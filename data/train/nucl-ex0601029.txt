    "a @xmath18  bound in a nucleus decays via either mesonic weak decay , @xmath18 @xmath19 , or nonmesonic weak decay ( nmwd ) , @xmath20 .",
    "mesonic decay is essentially similar to free @xmath18 decay and has been studied in detail . in a nucleus",
    "a @xmath18 can decay via an interaction with a neighbor nucleon , either a proton ( @xmath21 , proton - induced nmwd ) or a neutron ( @xmath22 , neutron - induced nmwd ) ; this is referred to as a one - nucleon - induced ( 1n ) nmwd process . the two - nucleon induced ( 2n ) process ( @xmath18@xmath23 ; @xmath24 ) , which is another nmwd mode , has been predicted theoretically ; however , it has not yet been verified experimentally .",
    "the nmwd process has attracted considerable attention since it provides the only practical means of studying the strangeness - changing baryonic weak interaction at present  @xcite .    since the discovery of hypernuclei , one of the primary concerns in the study of nmwd of @xmath18  hypernuclei has been the relative strength of the two channels of 1n nmwd - the ratio of the decay widths ( / ) .",
    "experimental ratios over the broad mass range of @xmath18  hypernuclei are consistently greater than unity , thereby indicating the dominance of the neutron channel ; on the other hand , the theoretical ratios are only one tenth of unity .",
    "the predominance of the proton channel in the theoretical prediction is due to the fact that the tensor term of one - pion exchange ( ope ) contributing only to the proton channel is very high , and therefore , the contributions of other meson exchange terms become minor corrections .",
    "the ope contribution is included in all model calculations for the long range contribution ; hence , the @xmath7  ratios have remained at around 0.1 .",
    "this intriguing problem is referred to as the @xmath7  puzzle .    in order to reduce the predominance of the proton - induced nmwd of the ope model ,",
    "many theoretical models for short range contribution , such as the heavy meson exchange ( hme ) models and the direct quark ( dq ) model have been studied .",
    "all these models have been unsuccessful in increasing the @xmath7  ratio significantly until recently .",
    "however , in recent important development , the incorrect sign in kaon exchange amplitudes was identified ; the correction significantly increased the @xmath7  values  of these models @xcite .",
    "thus , the current theoretical values of the @xmath8/@xmath10 ratio have increased to 0.34 - 0.70 for @xmath25he and 0.29 - 0.53 for @xmath0c  @xcite .    until recently experimental @xmath7  values were extracted by fitting intranuclear cascade ( inc ) calculation yields to the experimental proton yields",
    "almost all the experimental @xmath7 ratios have been close to or greater than unity  @xcite .",
    "however , recent high - quality neutron yield spectra obtained by our group have made it possible to derive the @xmath7  ratio directly by comparing the neutron yields to the corresponding proton yields ; the  ratios obtained by this method are @xmath260.5 for @xmath0c  @xcite and @xmath260.6 for @xmath15he  @xcite agreeing well with the recent theoretical values .",
    "these ratios are significantly smaller than unity .",
    "they are the first experimental indications of the proton channel dominance ( @xmath27 ) in the nmwd .",
    "it appears that the discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical values of the  ratios of nmwd has been removed .",
    "however , the @xmath7  ratios of 5lam  and  derived by comparing the nucleon yields still contain the ambiguity due to the possible contributions of 2n nmwd and the final state interaction ( fsi ) effects on the emitted nucleons . the current fsi model calculation which takes into account the 2n nmwd and fsi can not reproduce the yield spectra  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty of the ratios due to the ambiguity could not be estimated in such single nucleon ( singles ) measurements . in order to remove such ambiguity experimentally",
    ", the decay channel has to be explicitly identified for each event . in order to determine each decay channel of 1n - induced nmwd exclusively",
    ", we have performed a coincidence measurement of both n+p ( @xmath28 pair ) and n+n ( @xmath29 pair ) pair nucleons from the nmwd of the hypernuclei , 5lam  and .",
    "since @xmath18n @xmath30 nn is a two - body process , the outgoing nucleon pairs will exhibit a clear back - to - back ( @xmath31 ) correlation with regards to their opening angle , and their energy sum distribution would exhibit a peak at around the decay q value , @xmath26155 mev , although they are broadened due to nuclear medium effects . on the other hand , in 2n nmwd ,",
    "three nucleons are produced in the final state and a pair of nucleons among them would exhibit neither the @xmath32 feature in the opening angle nor the energy sum peak at the q value .",
    "the nucleon from 1n nmwd that suffered intense fsi on the way out of the residual nucleus would be deflected from the original momentum direction and lose kinetic energy , thereby degrading the kinematics characteristic of 1n nmwd .",
    "therefore , by applying the event selection criteria of kinematics , we can exclusively select 1n nmwd events suppressing possible contributions from the 2n process and the events that suffered serious fsi .",
    "recently we have reported the @xmath7  value of @xmath16-shell @xmath25he that was determined in the two - nucleon coincidence measurement of the nmwd  @xcite . by applying the kinematical condition for the opening angle",
    ", we obtained the pair number ratio of @xmath29 to @xmath28 pairs of 1n nmwd , @xmath33 , to be 0.45@xmath340.11@xmath340.03 .",
    "this ratio becomes essentially the  ratio when fsi is weak as in 5lam .",
    "the @xmath16-shell hypernucleus , @xmath35he , was selected for the first exclusive coincidence measurement , since the fsi effect for such a light hypernucleus must be small . however , the unambiguous determination of  for a @xmath14-shell hypernucleus also is essential in the study of baryonic weak interaction since only the @xmath14-shell hypernuclei can provide the @xmath14-wave initial state for the interaction while the @xmath16-shell 5lam  does only that of @xmath16-wave .",
    "the importance of the @xmath14-wave contribution in the nmwd in the finite nucleus has been discussed in the reference  @xcite . in such respect ,  has been extensively studied together with 5lam .",
    "exclusive determination is even more important for the @xmath7  ratio of heavier @xmath14-shell hypernuclei such as  since the nucleons propagating there will suffer more intense fsi .",
    "although @xmath0c  is the most extensively studied @xmath14-shell @xmath18  hypernucleus , no unambiguous @xmath7  ratio for it is available yet .",
    "the values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath36 of protons from @xmath37 nmwd of the polarized hypernuclei were measured and reported for both @xmath15he and  formed via the ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) reaction . although small positive values of 0.24@xmath340.22 and 0.11@xmath340.08@xmath340.04  @xcite were observed for @xmath15he , a large negative value ( @xmath38 )",
    "was reported for the @xmath14-shell hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "authors indicated a possible explanation that the interaction mechanism of nmwd for short and long range could be different and therefore the initial @xmath14-state contribution in  made the difference .",
    "the theoretical predictions for the asymmetry parameter for 5lam  are about -0.7  @xcite from both the recent heavy meson exchange ( hme ) and the direct quark ( dq ) models .",
    "they significantly overestimate the magnitude of the parameter .",
    "the recent hme model prediction for @xmath36 of  is 0.36 that is again far off from the experimental value .",
    "the current difficulty in understanding the decay asymmetries of @xmath16- and @xmath14-shell hypernuclei implies that an accurate and unambiguous determination of @xmath7  ratios for both @xmath16- and @xmath14-shell hypernuclei is essential for nmwd studies .",
    "in this paper we report the results of the two - nucleon observables measured in the coincidence experiment of the decay of @xmath0c especially focusing on its @xmath7  ratio .",
    "captypefigure    the experiment was carried out at the k6 beam line of 12-gev proton synchrotron ( ps ) in high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) .",
    "@xmath18 hypernuclei @xmath0c were produced via the ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) reaction at the beam momentum of 1.05 gev / c on the @xmath39c target . in order to improve the vertex resolution , we used thin segmented plastic scintillators for an active @xmath39c target .",
    "[ fig : e508setup ] shows the schematic view of coincidence counters for detecting the decay product particles from the weak decay of @xmath0c .",
    "it comprises three sets of coincidence counter - two located at the top and bottom of the target , optimized for @xmath32 coincidence events and one at the side to allow the detection of non - back - to - back events .",
    "each of top and bottom counter sets comprise a fast timing counter ( t2 ) , a drift chamber ( pdc ) , veto or stop timing counter ( t3 ) and neutron counter arrays ( t4 ) .",
    "the side set is similar ; however , the pdc is absent .",
    "the inclusive @xmath0c  excitation energy spectrum derived from the momenta of incoming pion and the outgoing kaon is shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) . the two single particle @xmath18  states ( 1@xmath16 and 1@xmath14 )",
    "are clearly identified .",
    "the 1@xmath14 @xmath18  state is located just above proton emission threshold ; it decays into @xmath40b  by emitting a proton .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) show the excitation energy spectra in coincidence with the emitted pair nucleons @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the vertical lines show the applied gates of the decay measurement for ground state of @xmath0c .",
    "the enhancement of the yield in the quasi - free @xmath18  region of the @xmath29 coincidence excitation energy spectrum as compared with that of the @xmath28 pairs occurs due to the emission of two neutron via the absorption of @xmath41  from the quasi - free @xmath18 mesonic decay .",
    "captypefigure    neutral particles , @xmath42 and neutrons , were measured using six layers of 5 cm thick plastic scintillators ( t4 ) vetoed with t3 . the particle identification ( pid ) of the neutrons and @xmath42",
    "was achieved by using the flight time from the decay vertex to the fired t4 counter .",

    "can be understood as a combined result of a statistical fluctuation due to the limited statistics of pair events ( total 43 counts only in the region ) and the binning effect of neutron z - position analysis ( refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : e508setup ] ) .",
    "it was revealed that the background nucleon pairs produced through the absorption of @xmath53 from the mesonic decay of @xmath0c  in the materials around the target were insignificant unlike the situation in the case of @xmath25he  @xcite .",

    "however , although dominance of kinematics events is degraded to a certain extent in the pairs , the events continue to be a major contribution .",

    "the rms energy - sum resolutions , @xmath78 , for @xmath29 and @xmath28 pairs were estimated to be 11 and 9 mev for typical cases , such as 75 mev nucleons , respectively .",
    "the energy - sum spectra show that the pair yields are distributed over a broad energy region from 70@xmath2680 mev to the q value at around 155 mev ; on the other hand , a few pair yields exist above the q values . those present above the q values are considered to be due to the rapid deterioration in the neutron - energy resolution with an increase in the neutron energy .",
    "since the energy sum spectrum of the two nucleons emitted in the two - body decay process , @xmath79 , would exhibit a peak at around the q value , @xmath26155 mev , the broad energy distribution indicates that a large number of the kinematics nucleons suffered an energy loss on the way out of the residual nucleus with a mass of @xmath80 .",
    "on the other hand , a dominant narrow peak around q value was clearly visible in the pair energy sum spectrum of @xmath15he  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : raw](e ) ) in comparison with those of @xmath25he . by considering that 2n theoretical branching ratio does not vary considerably with the mass number , and therefore",
    ", the relative importance of 2n with respect to 1n would be more or less the same for @xmath25he and @xmath0c  @xcite , we infer that fsi is the major cause of broadening and quenching in the angular correlation and the degradation in the energy - sum spectrum .",
    "this implies that the effect of fsi on the pair numbers , even in the @xmath32 region , would not be negligible , and we must take it into account in order to extract @xmath82 ratio from the pair number ratio . a significant portion ( @xmath2640% ) of the pair number",
    "is observed in the non - back - to - back region as shown in table  [ tab : pair_number ] .",
    "the possible contributions in the non - back - to - back region are such as 2n(or multinucleon)-induced nmwd events , those that suffer strong fsi , @xmath41 absorption contamination and random coincidence events etc .",
    "however , in @xmath0c , the contributions from the last two cases are found to be almost negligible , and the first two are considered to be the major contributions in non - back - to - back region .",
    "these non - events , whose strength reaches @xmath2640 percent of nmwd , are the sources of the ambiguity in the previous results of  since they can not be distinguished from 1n nmwd in the singles measurement .",
    "however , we can reject them by considering only the coincidence pair numbers in the region in the derivation of , thereby resulting the ratio which is almost free from the ambiguity inherent in the previous results .",
    "next , we would like to derive the @xmath82 ratio from the pair number ratio , @xmath33 ,  of the @xmath32 region .",
    "if neither @xmath24 contribution nor fsi existed , the ratio of @xmath33 would become @xmath82 .",
    "however , as discussed , the effects of fsi still remain in the pair numbers of @xmath0c .",
    "the most harmful effect of fsi is the channel crossover such as that from to or from to @xmath29 .",
    "it directly contaminates the pair number ratio .",
    "we observed 8 @xmath83 pair coincidence events in the @xmath32 region , which are possible only via the fsi process .",
    "a neutron in the @xmath28 pair emitted at the vertex is converted into a proton via the nuclear interaction on the way out of the nucleus , thereby registering as a @xmath83 coincidence event .",
    "therefore , they represent the channel crossover information of fsi on the nucleons emitted .",
    "table  [ tab : pair_number ] shows @xmath74 yields - the normalized @xmath83 pair numbers per nmwd .",
    "we will utilize @xmath74 for the correction of the fsi crossover effect on @xmath7  ratio .",
    "the pair numbers in the @xmath32 region @xmath5(@xmath32 ) , @xmath6(@xmath32 ) and @xmath74(@xmath32 ) can be expressed as    @xmath84    where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the fractions of neutron and proton induced channels out of the nmwd .",
    "@xmath87 is the loss factor of neutrons ( protons ) from the energy region of interest due to fsi and @xmath88 is the resulting crossover influx factor of neutrons ( protons ) from protons ( neutrons ) channel .",
    "the first terms of @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the pair numbers emitted out of the nucleus that maintain the channel starting at the initial weak vertex point .",
    "the second terms represent the pair numbers that cross the channel and end in a channel different from the starting one .",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath90 are the loss factors from the angular region of the original and channel crossing pairs ; however , their actual values are not required in the following derivation .",
    "instead , they are replaced with the observed @xmath83 pair numbers .",
    "if there were no fsi effects , @xmath87 and @xmath88 would be one and zero , respectively .",
    "we put @xmath91 and @xmath92 by considering the charge symmetry of a strong interaction .",

    "the ratio of the raw pair numbers simply integrated over the region 0.60@xmath340.12 becomes 0.53@xmath340.13 after the subtraction of the uniform background .",
    "the obtained  ratio @xmath102 in the eq .",
    "[ eq : gngp ]   is only 4 percent reduced from the pair number ratio @xmath103 .",
    "this is surprising considering that we observed the strong fsi effect both in the energy - sum spectra and in the angular correlations .",
    "however , the small correction can be understood considering that @xmath104 and hence the crossover pair numbers from to and from to are almost balanced , and therefore , the crossover - influx and -outflux due to fsi cancel each other .",
    "the systematic errors mainly originate from the uncertainties of the neutron detection efficiency ( 6% ) and the @xmath83 pair acceptance ( 4% ) .",
    "many sources of uncertainty such as @xmath105 and detection efficiencies are canceled out by taking the ratio  @xcite .",
    "the present result determined with the pair nucleon number ratio @xmath33 is in good agreement with the recent theoretical results based on heavy meson exchange ( hme ) model calculations  @xcite .",
    "it finally resolved the longstanding  ratio puzzle without ambiguity by removing the effect of fsi self - consistently and by rejecting non - events applying kinematic condition .",
    "it is quite accidental that the present result is close to that of the previous singles measurement which were determined only by assuming the nonexistence of 2n ( or multi - nucleon induced ) nmwd  @xcite .",
    "however , we have pointed out that there exist a significant amount ( @xmath106%  of the total ) of non - events , which probably are the candidates of them",
    ". the present @xmath82 ratio of @xmath0c is in good agreement with that of the previous exclusive measurement of @xmath25he ( @xmath107 ) , which indicates that the nmwd mechanism of @xmath16-shell ( @xmath25he ) and @xmath14-shell ( @xmath0c ) hypernuclei are rather similar .",
    "though the  ratio determined from the ratio of pair numbers @xmath33 agrees well with those of the theoretical predictions  @xcite , there remain discrepancies between the pair numbers @xmath57 of our measurement and those of the theoretical calculation  @xcite : the pair numbers for events and non - events , and the significant quenching of pair numbers of  compared with those of 5lam .",
    "for example , the observed pair number of events is about half of the prediction while that of non - events is only a fraction .",
    "we have measured , for the first time , the angular correlation @xmath57(cos@xmath50 ) of the pair nucleons and from the nmwd of  in coincidence measurement .",
    "we have exclusively identified the dominant 1n nmwd process , @xmath108 and @xmath4 , by requiring the angular correlation of the two emitted pair nucleons , which is the characteristic of two - body decay .",
    "then we have obtained the @xmath7 ratio from the ratio of pair numbers @xmath33 of 1n nmwd in which most of the non - events are excluded and fsi effects have been corrected using the simultaneously measured @xmath83 pair events .",
    "therefore , the present @xmath7 result is almost free from the ambiguities due to 2n(or multinucleon induced ) nmwd contribution and the fsi effects which were inherent in the previous results obtained with singles spectra .",
