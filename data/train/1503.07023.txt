    "gauge theories in two spatial dimensions may contain a chern - simons term @xcite which explicitly breaks parity and time - reversal symmetry . in these theories the gauge field acquires a mass and the charged particles obey fractional anyonic statistics @xcite .",

    "abelian chern - simons theories have been used to facilitate bosonization or fermi - bose transmutation in @xmath8 dimensions @xcite . furthermore , chern - simons gauge theories are of central importance in the context of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite and other condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "they also play an important role for topological quantum computation @xcite . by braiding world - lines of anyonic quasi - particles",
    ", one can accumulate appropriate non - abelian berry phases @xcite , which can encode quantum information .",
    "when the anyons obey a sufficiently complex version of non - abelian braid statistics , they can be employed to realize the quantum gates that are sufficient to realize universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the idea of topological quantum computation is attractive because the quantum information is then naturally protected from decoherence by the topological nature of the non - abelian berry phases . in particular ,",
    "information is not stored locally but is distributed throughout the entire system .",
    "the toric code is a @xmath8-d @xmath9 lattice gauge theory which can be used as a topologically protected storage device for quantum information @xcite .",
    "this theory has charges and dual charges with mutually anyonic statistics .    in this paper , we derive extensions of the toric code from a doubled compact lattice chern - simons - maxwell theory with abelian gauge group @xmath4 .",
    "similar to fermions , topologically massive gauge fields also suffer from a lattice doubling problem . here",
    "we are not trying to circumvent this problem but work with a lattice gauge field and an independent gauge field associated with the dual lattice .",
    "the fundamental gauge degrees of freedom are then associated with a cross formed by a link and its corresponding dual link .",
    "the chern - simons term couples the two lattices and implies that the canonically conjugate momenta ( i.e.  the electric field strengths ) of the original and the dual gauge field do not commute . in ordinary lattice gauge theories @xcite the field algebra is link - based .",
    "this framework has also been used in studies of chern - simons gauge theories on the lattice @xcite . in our lattice formulation of a doubled chern - simons gauge theories , on the other hand",
    ", the field algebra is cross - based .",
    "such a system was first investigated in @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate on the relation of this theory to the toric code .    in ordinary lattice gauge theory with a link - based field algebra every link has a `` mechanical '' analog .",
    "it behaves like a `` particle '' moving in the group space .",
    "for example , the dynamics of a link variable in a compact abelian @xmath4 lattice gauge theory is analogous to the one of a quantum mechanical particle moving on a circle .",
    "similarly , in our unconventional lattice gauge theory with a cross - based field algebra , the `` mechanical '' analog of each cross is a charged `` particle '' moving on a 2-dimensional group space torus @xmath2 threaded by an abstract `` magnetic '' field @xcite .",
    "the dirac quantization condition for the abstract `` magnetic '' flux then implies the quantization of the level @xmath3  the prefactor of the chern - simons term .",
    "interestingly , the corresponding cross - based hamiltonian has two self - adjoint extension parameters , which naturally enter the quantum theory as external parameters , while the classical theory is insensitive to these parameters . remarkably , the self - adjoint extension parameters ( which are associated with the links and the dual links ) themselves form two non - dynamical @xmath4 lattice gauge fields .",
    "this reduces the manifest gauge symmetry of the quantum theory from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "this quantum mechanical breaking of the gauge symmetry could be called an `` anomaly '' . however , it is more like the explicit breaking of cp invariance caused by a non - zero @xmath10-vacuum angle in 4-dimensional non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "it is intriguing that the quantized doubled chern - simons - maxwell lattice gauge theory dynamically reduces its manifest gauge symmetry from @xmath4 to the @xmath5 gauge group of an extended toric code .",
    "the full dynamics reduces to the one of the toric code in the pure chern - simons limit of infinite `` photon '' mass .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to perform a detailed mathematical derivation of an extended version of the @xmath5 variant of the toric code as a limit of doubled @xmath4 chern - simons - maxwell lattice gauge theory .",
    "we put particular emphasis on the role played by the self - adjoint extension parameters of the cross - based hamiltonian .",
    "this embeds the toric code in a wider theoretical framework and thus provides a broader perspective on quantum information processing .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to investigate whether berry phases that arise from adiabatic changes of the external self - adjoint extension parameters can be utilized for quantum information processing .",
    "in this paper , we do not yet address these questions .",
    "we also view the present paper as a first step towards similar studies in the context of non - abelian chern - simons theories on the lattice .",
    "variants of the toric code with a discrete non - abelian gauge group @xcite , which are discussed in the context of topological quantum computation , may be related to chern - simons gauge theories with continuous gauge groups in a similar manner .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss chern - simons - maxwell gauge theory of a single abelian gauge field in the continuum , while in section 3 we investigate the doubled theory with two abelian gauge fields . in section 4",
    "we regularize this theory on a lattice and its dual lattice , with a cross - based field algebra using non - compact abelian lattice gauge fields .",
    "in particular , we discuss the mutual anyonic statistics of the charges moving on the original and the dual lattice . in section 5",
    "we turn to compact abelian gauge fields , which leads to the quantization of the level @xmath3 as well as to the generation of a non - dynamical background lattice gauge field formed by the self - adjoint extension parameters of the cross - based hamiltonian . in the limit of a large `` photon '' mass",
    "this theory reduces to the toric code .",
    "finally , section 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section we investigate abelian chern - simons - maxwell theory in the continuum . after considering a single abelian gauge field , in the next section we will study a doubled theory which will turn out to arise in the continuum limit of the lattice theory that we discuss later .",

    "i.e.  when @xmath32 , the gauge field becomes infinitely heavy . in the pure maxwell theory ( with @xmath33 ) , on the other hand , the gauge field remains massless , and plane waves are purely transverse .    in order to quantize the theory , we now impose canonical commutation relations @xmath34 = - i \\delta_{ij } \\delta(x - y),\\ ] ] which imply the following commutation relations between the electric and magnetic fields @xmath35 = - i \\frac{k}{2 \\pi } \\epsilon_{ij } \\delta(x - y ) , \\nonumber \\\\ & & [ b(x),b(y ) ] = 0 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & [ e_i(x),b(y ) ] = i \\epsilon_{ij } \\partial_j \\delta(x - y).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the derivative in the third equation is with respect to @xmath36 ( not @xmath37 ) . as a consequence of the chern - simons term , the two components of the electric field do not commute with each other .",

    "in the next section , we will regularize chern - simons - maxwell theory on a particular lattice , which will result in a doubling problem , similar to the well - known lattice fermion doubling problem .",
    "the continuum limit of that lattice theory is a doubled chern - simons - maxwell theory with two abelian gauge fields , which we first investigate directly in the continuum .",
    "we now consider two abelian gauge fields @xmath11 and @xmath43 with the lagrangian @xmath44 without loss of generality one can assume that the dual charge equals the original charge ( i.e.  @xmath45 ) . if this is not the case a priori , one can achieve this by a simple rescaling of the fields .",
    "unlike the theory with a single gauge field , the doubled theory is invariant under time - reversal and parity , because one can treat @xmath43 as a pseudo - vector .",

    "the explicit symmetry breaking from @xmath4 to @xmath5 has a quantum mechanical origin , because only the quantum but not the classical theory is sensitive to the external self - adjoint extension parameters , which manifest themselves as aharonov - bohm phases .",
    "one might thus describe the quantum mechanical gauge symmetry breaking as an `` anomaly '' .",
    "however , it is more like the explicit breaking of cp invariance due to a non - zero @xmath10-vacuum angle in 4-dimensional non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "it is remarkable that a gauge symmetry can be broken by quantum effects in a similar manner .",
    "it should , however , be pointed out that the redundancy associated with the @xmath4 gauge symmetry of the classical theory still persists at the quantum level .",
    "it manifests itself in the @xmath4 gauge redundancy of the external background lattice gauge fields formed by the self - adjoint extension parameters @xmath10 and @xmath180 . in this paper , we have not attempted to take the continuum limit by sending @xmath350 .",
    "it is conceivable that the full @xmath4 gauge symmetry would then emerge dynamically from the manifest @xmath5 symmetry , and that the lattice theory would reduce to the non - compact doubled chern - simons - maxwell continuum theory discussed in section 3 .",
    "while the electric field energy does not depend on the values of the self - adjoint extension parameters , the magnetic field energy does .",
    "the @xmath5 toric code emerges from the doubled chern - simons - maxwell theory in the limit of infinite `` photon '' mass , @xmath351 . in this limit",
    "the magnetic field energy vanishes , and thus the dependence of the energy on the self - adjoint extension parameters disappears .",
    "however , the wave function still depends on @xmath10 and @xmath180 . as a result",
    ", the toric code has a large variety of hidden self - adjoint extension parameters , which form two @xmath4 gauge fields , one associated with the original and one associated with the dual lattice . under adiabatic changes of the parameters",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath180 , a @xmath7 berry gauge field with non - trivial berry curvature arises .",
    "since the berry field strength turned out to be gauge equivalent to an abelian field strength , manipulating the corresponding berry phases will certainly not allow universal topological quantum computation .",
    "still , it will be interesting to investigate further whether manipulating these parameters can be utilized for other forms of quantum information processing .    in this work",
    ", we have encountered a large variety of different gauge fields .",
    "first of all , we started out with non - compact abelian gauge fields @xmath352 and @xmath353 , both in the continuum and on the lattice .",
    "upon compactification of the gauge group , this gave rise to the compact @xmath4 lattice gauge fields @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the group space of an original and dual cross - based link - pair @xmath2 was endowed with an abstract vector potential @xmath162 describing the quantized `` magnetic '' flux represented by the level @xmath103 .",
    "the polyakov loops winding around the group space torus @xmath2 then gave rise to two self - adjoint extension parameters @xmath10 and @xmath180 , which play the role of aharonov - bohm phases for the `` mechanical '' analog `` particle '' moving in the group space . while they are invisible at the classical level , at the quantum level the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath180 break the manifest gauge symmetry from @xmath4 down to @xmath5 .",
    "still , the full @xmath4 redundancy of the gauge description remains , because the self - adjoint extension parameters themselves turned out to be non - dynamical background lattice gauge fields associated with the original and dual lattice , respectively .",
    "an extended version of the toric code then emerges at low energies , which is a @xmath5 lattice gauge theory .",
    "finally , by considering adiabatic changes of the self - adjoint extension parameters @xmath10 and @xmath180 , @xmath7 berry gauge fields arise , which are defined over the base space of the lattice gauge fields @xmath10 and @xmath180 .",
    "all these different gauge structures are intimately related to one another , and deserve further study , in particular , in the context of quantum information processing .",
    "we have often mentioned the `` mechanical '' analog of a `` particle '' moving in the cross - based group space torus @xmath2 , threaded by @xmath3 units of quantized `` magnetic '' flux .",
    "it would be most interesting to build such a system in the laboratory , in order to manipulate quantum information .",
    "while building a torus seems like a most difficult task ( at least to us ) , we have great confidence in the ingenuity of amo experimentalists .",
    "perhaps one can manipulate trapped ions to mimic the physics of the cross - based `` mechanical '' analog . using digital quantum simulations with up to 100 gate quantum operations @xcite",
    ", this has already been achieved for a single plaquette of the ordinary ( i.e.  not extended ) @xmath9 toric code @xcite .",
    "if one could experimentally incorporate the background gauge fields @xmath10 and @xmath180 , putting together several crosses would provide us with a remarkable quantum system that embodies a large variety of abelian dynamical or background gauge fields as well as an additional @xmath7 berry connection .",
    "it would be interesting to extend our investigations to non - abelian chern - simons - maxwell theories on the lattice .",
    "in particular , one may ask whether they also reduce to variants of the toric code with a discrete non - abelian gauge group .",
    "we leave this problem for future studies .",
    "we like to thank d.  banerjee , m.  blau , m.  dalmonte , m.  lscher , e.  rico ortega , a.  smilga , and p.  zoller for illuminating discussions .",
