    "wz  sge is a nearby , short period dwarf nova with an exceptionally long inter - outburst interval ( 2030yr ) .",
    "these long intervals are probably caused by the truncation of the ( usually unstable ) inner accretion disc by the magnetic field of the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "this picture is supported by the detection of a 28s modulation in the quiescent optical and x - ray emission , which is probably the spin period of the magnetised white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the july  august 2001 superoutburst of wz  sge was the first since 1978 , and was observed intensively from the ground and from space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we present the x - ray and extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) observations made with the _ chandra _ observatory .",
    "these data were originally reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "wz  sge was observed seven times with _",
    "chandra _ during the 2001 superoutburst .",
    "three observations were made using the low energy transmission grating ( letg ) and four with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) .",
    "letg observations provide high spectral resolution in the euv and soft x - ray wavebands ( 5170 ) .",
    "acis - s provides low - resolution observations in the hard and soft x - ray wavebands ( 150 ) .",
    "the times of all seven observations are indicated with respect to the optical outburst in the top panel of fig.[fig - all ] .",
    "the letg observations are identified with the labels l13 and the acis - s observations with a14 .",
    "the lower panels of fig.[fig - all ] show the mean count rates from the seven _",
    "chandra _ observations .",
    "it can be seen that the euv flux was very high in the early outburst and then declined more quickly than the optical .",
    "the x - ray flux dropped gradually during the main outburst , recovered after the end of the main outburst ( l3 ) , but was suppressed again during the first echo outburst ( a3 ) .",
    "the x - ray flux recovered again ( by a larger factor ) by the end of the echo outbursts ( a4 ) .",
    "this overall euv and x - ray flux evolution is broadly consistent with that seen in other dwarf novae in outburst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "light curves from the first 11d of the optical outburst were dominated by an _ outburst orbital hump _",
    "( ooh ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is believed to be due to the excitation of the 2:1 tidal resonance in the expanding accretion disc , and is seen only in wz  sge - type stars , where the mass ratio is sufficiently extreme to allow the disc to reach the resonant radius @xcite .",
    "the later optical outburst is dominated by the _",
    "common superhump , _ which is a feature of the superoutbursts in all dwarf novae , and is believed to be due to the excitation of the 3:1 tidal resonance .",
    "the light curves of the individual letg observations , plotted in fig.[fig - llc ] , show that the ooh is detected in the euv , but that the common superhump is not .",
    "it can seen that the ooh modulations in the optical and euv are both double peaked and in phase .",
    "these results suggest that the ooh is a geometric effect , with a two - arm spiral wave modifying our view of the inner accretion disc and/or white dwarf .",
    "the absence of the common superhump in the euv emission supports the view that this is a dissipative effect in the eccentric accretion disc .",
    "the high - energy spectra of dwarf novae change dramatically between quiescence and outburst .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig - schematic ] .",
    "quiescent x - ray spectra are normally fitted with multi - temperature optically thin thermal models , such as cooling flows , with temperatures in the range 110kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in outburst",
    "the x - ray emission is replaced with intense optically thick emission in the euv band , with characteristic temperatures around 10ev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and an x - ray spectrum that is lower in temperature than in quiescence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the l1 and l2 euv spectra of wz  sge in outburst are plotted in the lower panels of fig.[fig - oy_l1_l2 ] . instead of the expected bright continuum these spectra",
    "are dominated by strong and broad emission lines .",
    "the only similar euv spectrum of a dwarf nova is the _ euve _ spectrum of the eclipsing system oy  car in superoutburst , which is reproduced in the top panel of fig.[fig - oy_l1_l2 ] .",
    "the similarity is striking .",
    "@xcite argued that this spectrum can be understood if the boundary layer of oy  car is hidden from direct view by the highly - inclined accretion disk , and if boundary layer radiation is scattered into our line of sight by the accretion disk wind .",
    "this interpretation naturally explains the salient features of the euv spectra of oy  car and wz  sge in outburst : the lines are identified with resonance transitions of intermediate ionisation stages of cosmically abundant elements , the lines are broad ( @xmath0 ) because the wind velocity is high , and the continuum is weak because the wind electron optical depth is low .",
    "the inclination of wz  sge is @xmath1 @xcite and so this interpretation requires that optically thick material extends at least @xmath2 out of the orbital plane .",
    "the letg x - ray spectra during outburst are plotted in fig.[fig - l123_xray ] .",
    "the first two spectra are dominated by emission lines of h- and he - like species of c , n , o , and ne . these spectra are therefore likely to represent thermal emission from a collisionally - excited optically thin plasma .",
    "the third letg spectrum , taken late in the decline from the main outburst and before the first echo outburst , shows a blue continuum and strong h - like lines ( note in particular the reversed h- and he - like line ratios of ne ) .",
    "this spectrum clearly originates from a plasma that is much hotter than that responsible for the l1 and l2 short - wavelength spectra . fitting this third spectrum",
    ", we find an acceptable fit with a single - temperature thermal plasma model with @xmath3kev and @xmath4 .",
    "this temperature is typical of the boundary layers of dwarf novae in quiescence , while the high column density is presumably due to the remnants of the disc material that blocked our view of the boundary layer during outburst .",
    "the l1 and l2 spectra , in contrast , are not consistent with emission from the boundary layer .",
    "spectral fitting shows that the emission measure rises to lower temperatures , whereas boundary layer emission in quiescence rises to high temperatures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "more importantly , the l1 and l2 spectra are not consistent with the high column density measured in the l3 spectrum .",
    "this shows that the x - ray emission seen in outburst can not pass through the material blocking our view to the boundary layer .",
    "other possible sources of x - ray emission during outburst include scattering in the accretion disc wind ( as we suggest for the euv component ) .",
    "this has also been suggested to explain the lack of soft x - ray eclipses in high - state systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , unlike the euv , there is no evidence for a strong continuum in soft x - rays that could be scattered by the wind .",
    "the soft x - ray lines also arise from more highly ionised species than are believed to be present in the wind , and crucially , the x - ray lines in wz  sge are too narrow to be due to scattering in the wind ( @xmath5 compared with @xmath6 in the euv ) .",
    "alternative possibilities for the origin of soft x - rays during dwarf nova outbursts include internal shocks in the @xmath6 wind , and solar - like coronal emission from the atmosphere of the accretion disc itself ( @xmath5 corresponds to the kepler velocity of the accretion disc at a radius of around @xmath7 ) .",
    "coronal emission might turn on in outburst as the disc becomes more magnetically active . in this case",
    "soft x - ray outburst emission might allow us to study the magneto - rotational instability in action .",
