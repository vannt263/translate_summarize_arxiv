    "in particular , the volume 2-form for a two - dimensional surface is written as the following wedge product @xmath134 where @xmath135 .",
    "the volume form in two - dimensions is an area , and often written using the shorthand `` @xmath8 '' .",
    "it can be used to define a pair of line 1-forms `` @xmath136 '' , which are natural in the given coordinate system : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is a two - dimensional levi - civita tensor density of weight @xmath139 .",
    "notice that the sum only permits values of @xmath140 , therefore @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the covariant derivative ( or levi - civita connection ) at a point @xmath38 is an extension of the directional derivative .",
    "it takes two arguments : a direction vector @xmath143 defined in the tangent plane at @xmath38 and a tensor field over the tangent bundle to the manifold , that must be smoothly varying in the neighbourhood of @xmath38 .",

    "for a @xmath154-from , the action of the covariant derivative can be defined by demanding that the `` leibniz rule '' holds .",

    "as described in the main text , the aim is to calculate the drag coefficient associated with an inclusion moving though a two - dimensional fluid .",
    "if the protein is moving with a steady velocity @xmath159 then the force balance equation for hydrodynamic drag is given by @xmath160 where @xmath40 is the boundary to the surface at the inclusion and @xmath41 is shorthand for the line 1-form .",
    "the cauchy stress tensor is a rank-@xmath161 tensor , with components given by @xmath162 where @xmath32 is the hydrostatic pressure field , the constant @xmath22 is a two - dimensional viscosity .",
    "so , in order to calculate the drag , it is first necessary to know both the pressure and velocity fields , _ i.e. _ , to solve stokes equation .",
    "as mentioned in the main text , the derivation of stokes equation on a manifold already exists in the literature .",
    "the result , in component form , is that @xmath163 in principle , ( [ sm : stokes_component ] ) can be solved , for given boundary conditions , when taken together with the condition of incompressibility , @xmath164 in practice , it is often easier to use a stream function @xmath45 , defined such that @xmath165 where @xmath47 is a two - dimensional anti - symmetric levi - civita symbol , and @xmath48 is the determinant of the metric @xmath49 .",

    "<S> the protein induces a localised deformation , or ` dimple ' , in the membrane , the magnitude ( and extent ) of which decreases as the applied tension is increased . to investigate the effect of shape on dynamics , the authors of @xcite traced the motion of kvap at different membrane tensions and compared the corresponding diffusion constant to the reference , or control , values exhibited by a cylindrically shaped protein ( of equivalent radius ) , which can be related to the theory of saffman and delbrck @xcite . at high tensions the corrections due to the shape of kvap were very small ( @xmath1 5% ) , whilst at lower tensions the corrections ( @xmath1 40% ) </S>",
    "<S> were much more pronounced .    in order to explain these results , the authors of @xcite invoked a polaron - like theory @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> such an effect is not apparent in the data , which suggests that , for sufficiently high tensions , the brownian motion of kvap should be indistinguishable from a cylindrically shaped protein of the same radius ( such as the aquaporin aqp0 , used as a control by quemeneur _ </S>",
