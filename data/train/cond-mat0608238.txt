    "a two - dimensional triangular network of magnetic ions interacting via an antiferromagnetic interaction is a well known geometrically frustrated system where unconventional magnetic properties are expected @xcite . usually , a long range magnetic order occurs at low enough temperature .",
    "for instance , in xcl@xmath0 with x = cr , br , or in acro@xmath0 with a = li , ag , cu , or cscucl@xmath4 the magnetic order is based on a 120@xmath5 spin structure on the triangles .",
    "all these compounds have an easy plane or easy axis anisotropy together with heisenberg type antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "in other compounds , no magnetic order was detected so far ( nacro@xmath0 , kcro@xmath0 , natio@xmath0 , linio@xmath0 ) . the possibility of the orbital order competing with the spin order makes linio@xmath0 particularly interesting . in this",
    "compounds the ni@xmath1 ions have a spin @xmath2 and the orbital occupation is doubly degenerate : the @xmath6 orbitals , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , have the same energy unless the oxygen octahedron around the magnetic ion becomes elongated or compressed due to the jahn - teller effect .",
    "surprisingly , no orbital order has been observed in linio@xmath0 .",
    "the absence of both orbital and magnetic order in this compound has been the subject of intense debate lately , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . in particular , there is still a controversy on what are the relevant magnetic interactions within the triangular planes and to what extend this compound is magnetically frustrated .",
    "the comparison with the isomorphic nanio@xmath0 is aimed at elucidating this unconventional behavior . in nanio@xmath0 a ferro - distortive orbital order ( a collective jahn - teller distortion )",
    "is observed below 480  k @xcite and a long range antiferromagnetic order appears below 20  k @xcite .",
    "this magnetic order was first described as an a type antiferromagnet with ferromagnetic planes coupled antiferromagnetically @xcite@xcite .",
    "the magnetic superlattice has indeed been observed recently in neutron diffraction measurements @xcite .",
    "however , the description of the magnetic system with just two magnetic interactions ( an antiferromagnetic @xmath9 between subsequent nio planes and a ferromagnetic @xmath10 within the planes ) fails to describe the whole magnetic behavior , in particular the presence of three characteristic fields observed in the magnetization curve @xcite .",
    "the direction of the spins measured by neutron diffraction is also unusual : they point toward the center of one of the triangles in the oxygen octahedron surrounding each ni ion , at @xmath11 from the ni plane @xcite .",
    "moreover , a recent inelastic neutron study @xcite has shown that a gap of @xmath120.7  mev is present in the spin excitation spectrum .",
    "we have performed electron spin resonance measurements in magnetic fields up to 14  t on powder samples of nanio@xmath0 .",
    "we adopted and extended the model used to describe the magnon spectrum @xcite .",
    "we find that the low field behavior of the system is characteristic of an `` easy - plane '' magnet , with a small anisotropy within the plane .",
    "the spin - flop transition is assigned to this latter anisotropy . at high fields",
    "all spins are aligned parallel and the saturation effects dominate the behavior .",
    "although the model described here is generally successful , we also observed a spin resonance mode that remains unexplained .",
    "the possible implications for the magnetic interactions in linio@xmath0 are discussed .",
    "the nanio@xmath0 powdered sample was obtained following the procedure described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the monoclinic c2/m crystal structure was checked by x - ray powder diffraction .",
    "the system is quasi two - dimensional : the ni - ni interplane distance is large , 5.568  @xmath13 . below the jahn - teller transition at 480",
    "k the ni@xmath1 ions are arranged in a slightly distorted triangular network , with one short length and two longer ones ( at room temperature , the ni - ni distances are 2.84  @xmath13 and 3.01  @xmath13 respectively compared to 2.96  @xmath13 at 565  k ) @xcite .",
    "also , the oxygen octahedra surrounding the nickel ions are elongated .",
    "such a distortion favors the @xmath7 orbitals .",
    "indeed , the esr spectra at 200k have the anisotropic shape typical of the @xmath14 orbitals , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 for fields parallel and perpendicular to @xmath17 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the magnetic behavior of our nanio@xmath18 sample was the same as the one reported previously @xcite .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility exhibits a curie - weiss behavior above 100  k. the curie - weiss temperature of @xmath19=36  k reflects the predominance of ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "this is a noticeable difference compared to frustrated triangular compounds such as licro@xmath18 .",
    "the effective magnetic moment ( 1.85 @xmath20@xmath21 ) is in agreement with the @xmath14 orbital configuration for the @xmath6 electron in the low spin state of ni@xmath1 ( spin s=1/2 , average gyromagnetic factor @xmath22 ) .",
    "the nel temperature , observed as a peak in the susceptibility , is @xmath23=20  k. the magnetization curve in the ordered phase at 4  k presents two kinks at @xmath24=1.8  t , @xmath25= 8  t , previously assigned to spin flop transitions , and the magnetization is fully saturated at @xmath26= 13  t @xcite .        the electron spin resonance measurements ( esr )",
    "were performed using two different techniques .",
    "classical high frequency , high magnetic field esr was used at fixed frequencies using gunn diode oscillators and multipliers at 35 , 75 , 150   and 225  ghz , combined with a 9  t magnet at the budapest university of technology and economics .",
    "previous measurements at the grenoble high magnetic field laboratory have been described in ref . .",
    "other measurements were performed by a novel method @xcite .",
    "we used the far infrared facilities of the national synchrotron light source in brookhaven national laboratory , at the u12 ir beamline , including a 14  t superconducting magnet ( oxford instruments ) , and a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ( sciencetech , sps 200 ) .",
    "we will present results obtained in the frequency range 3  @xmath3 - 20  @xmath3 ( 90  ghz - 600  ghz ) at 4 k. the powdered sample was in a disk - shaped teflon container of 5  mm diameter and 1  mm thickness , in the center of the magnet .",
    "light pipes were used to guide the infrared light from spectrometer to the sample , and the transmitted light was detected with a bolometer operating at 1.2k temperature .",
    "the light propagated parallel to the static magnetic field .",
    "spectra were recorded at fixed fields .",
    "the frequency resolution was selected at 0.2  @xmath3 , much less than the width of the resonance lines . the upper frequency cut - off",
    "was adjusted to about 20  @xmath3 with a fluorogold filter of appropriate thickness .",
    "the lower cut - off was limited by the incident spectrum and the spectrometer performance . the signal",
    "to noise ratio was good down to 3  @xmath3 , but there were strong minima in the incident light intensity around 3.7 and 4.6  @xmath3 .",
    "we eliminated the experimental points at these minima without loosing the data around them , obtaining reliable signal down to 3  @xmath3 . after averaging over several spectra ( typically between two and four ) and smoothing , the absorption spectrum at a given field was divided by a reference spectrum recorded at zero magnetic field , following the same procedure as described in ref .",
    "first , we present the esr results obtained with the classical esr technique . a typical spectrum ( the derivative of the absorbtion signal ) , recorded at 2.4  k at 75  ghz in the antiferromagnetic phase ,",
    "has three resonance features ( fig .",
    "[ figure 1 ] ) .",
    "the lines labeled ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) are shifted from the paramagnetic @xmath27 line differently and they exhibit different temperature dependencies . mode ( a ) has been already studied in @xcite and was related to the spin flop field at 1.8 t. mode ( b ) remains close to the paramagnetic line .",
    "mode ( c ) consists of two close resonances which broaden with temperature and are hardly resolved above 6  k. therefore only the first , larger intensity , resonance is plotted for the temperature dependence of mode ( c ) . below the phase transition temperature t@xmath28",
    ", this mode behaves as the order parameter .    the paramagnetic line splitting at 200  k ( empty symbols in fig .",
    "1 ) is in agreement with the line splitting studied in detail at several frequencies by chappel _",
    "there is also an agreement in the temperature dependence of the splitting .",
    "we will discuss the paramagnetic state in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "the measurements were done on powder samples , and therefore the large line broadening seen in fig . [ figure 1 ]",
    "is not surprising . for any given crystallite in the sample ,",
    "the line position depends on the relative direction of external field and the crystallographic axes .",
    "relatively sharp features appear in the spectrum because in the powder sample certain resonance frequencies ( _ e_.g .",
    "the highest and the lowest possible values ) acquire large statistical weight .",
    "this effect is well known from the powder samples with significant @xmath29-factor anisotropy .",
    "it is also important to notice that the presence of three lines in the spectrum at finite field does not necessarily mean that the microscopic hamiltonian of the system has three modes , for the same reasons as above . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of modes seen at zero external field ( where all crystallites are equivalent ) are directly relevant to the hamiltonian , as we will discuss later .",
    "the low temperature esr was further explored by far infrared spectroscopic methods .",
    "the advantage of detecting esr by far - ir spectroscopy is that one can readily map the power absorption over the full range of magnetic fields and frequencies .",
    "the measurement does not rely on sweeping the magnetic field ; this becomes especially important when one tries to discern features at zero field , or compare esr to inelastic neutron scattering done in zero field .",
    "typical absorbtion spectra at 0  t and 14  t recorded at 4  k are given in fig .",
    "[ figure 4 ] .",
    "the sharp peaks in the spectra are `` instrumental '' : either due to interference features in the synchrotron source , or generated by the multiple reflections in the sample , or in the spectrometer itself .",
    "nevertheless , the absorption due to spins is clearly visible with features around 6  @xmath3 ( labeled ( 1 ) ) , 9  @xmath3 ( labeled ( 2 ) ) and 11 - 18  @xmath3 ( labeled ( m ) ) .",
    "the key to these measurements is taking the ratio of two data sets at different fields , eliminating the features in the raw spectrum of the incident light , and leaving field dependent part of the absorption .",
    "we have chosen always the same reference : the spectrum at zero field , so that the relative transmission @xmath30 is related to the sample absorption @xmath31 : @xmath32 the relative transmission for @xmath33=14  t is plotted in the bottom part of fig .",
    "[ figure 4 ] .",
    "the data below 3  @xmath3 are not reliable .",
    "a smoothing procedure using a ft filter has been used to improve the signal to noise ratio .",
    "it is responsible for the weak oscillations with the 2  @xmath3 periodicity .",
    "the relative transmission data for several magnetic fields are plotted in fig .",

    "mode ( a ) has been discussed previously @xcite in terms of an easy axis antiferromagnet model @xcite .",

    "[ figure 3 ] ) .",
    "this model includes a strong ferromagnetic coupling in the ni planes , a weaker antiferromagnetic coupling between the ni planes and an even weaker anisotropy which aligns the spins in the easy axis direction .",
    "it was shown later that this model was incomplete in terms of explaining the magnetic properties , and an additional energy scale was required @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed by recent neutron inelastic scattering measurements @xcite .",
    "the magnon spectrum was interpreted in terms of an easy plane af model with the same ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings as in the previous model .",
    "the anisotropy was assigned to the ferromagnetic exchange coupling , and its magnitude was an order of magnitude larger than the weak anisotropy used in the evaluation of the esr data .",
    "these models were merged by assuming an anisotropy tensor that has an easy axis within an easy plane , with a much larger energy needed for turning the spins out of the plane than within the plane .",
    "this simple approach accounts for most of the experimental observations , including a better description of the low field esr data of chappel et al.@xcite .",
    "we start with the following anisotropic spin hamiltonian :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the magnetic field , @xmath56 is over nearest neighbor spins within the layers , and @xmath57 is over nearest neighbor spins along the @xmath43 directions .",
    "the exchange interactions are represented by tensors : @xmath58 describes the ferromagnetic intraplane exchange , and @xmath59 is the interplane antiferromagnetic exchange .",
    "the intensity and the frequency of the spin resonance lines for a crystal positioned in arbitrary direction relative to the external field can be calculated from the hamiltonian in two steps .",
    "first , the spin configuration is determined by minimizing the free energy ; second the esr frequencies are related to the small oscillations around the equilibrium configuration .",
    "there are two resonance modes for any given direction when the magnetic order is described by two sublattices .",
    "occasionally ( in zero field or field applied along high - symmetry directions ) the two modes may be degenerate .",
    "the powder spectrum is obtained by the average of the absorption of individual grains over all directions . in practice ,",
    "the calculation of frequency and intensity for arbitrary field orientation is rather hard . instead",
    ", the resonance frequency is calculated for the static field pointing in three principal directions .",
    "the six `` principal frequencies '' ( three frequencies for each of the two modes ) play a special role in the powder average , since some of them correspond to extremal values and the statistical weight factor for these frequencies will be high .",
    "this process is similar to the determination of the @xmath60 tensor from the paramagnetic resonance of a powder sample with a @xmath29-factor anisotropy .",
    "naturally , the orientation of the principal axes of the tensor relative to the crystallographic directions can not be determined from measurements on a powder sample .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath61-tensor components are routinely determined from powder measurements this way .",
    "it is often sufficient to look at the highest and lowest frequencies in the measured broad esr line , and one can identify the highest and lowest tensor components .    there is an extensive literature on the anisotropy effects in antiferromagnets , starting with the early work of keffer and kittel @xcite on the easy axis problem .",
    "the three axis case ( easy , intermediate , hard ) was treated by nagamiya @xcite . here",
    "we base our analysis on this work and on a review by turov @xcite .",
    "the magnon spectrum is treated in the linear approximation , equivalent to a quasi - classical treatment and we focus on the ground state properties ( @xmath62=0  k ) .",
    "the details of the calculation are given in appendix a and b. first , the hamiltonian is transformed into :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the total magnetization and the antiferromagnetic order parameter , respectively .",
    "parameter @xmath66 describes an isotropic antiferromagnetic coupling , @xmath67 and @xmath43 describe the anisotropy of the total ferromagnetic moment . in the ideal antiferromagnetic state @xmath68 , therefore these parameters have no influence on the free energy of the system in zero external magnetic field .",
    "on the other hand , parameters @xmath69 and @xmath45 act on the order parameter @xmath70 directly .",
    "kittel treated the uniaxial model ( @xmath71 ) at low fields ; easy plane and easy axis corresponds to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "nagamiya s biaxial model is obtained when @xmath74 .",
    "turov discusses the uniaxial case for fields up to the saturation field @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath72 so that the zero field equilibrium magnetizations are in the plane perpendicular to @xmath17 ; this will be the `` easy plane '' .",

    "( notice that these choices do not follow from the symmetry arguments related to the lattice distortion , but they were forced by the experimental observations ) .",

    "this is in general agreement with the inelastic neutron scattering result , where the magnon spectrum was modeled with an easy plane spin hamiltonian @xcite . for the easy plane system one of the magnon modes",
    "has zero energy ( in zero field and at zero wavenumber ) .",
    "the anisotropy within the easy plane pushes this magnon mode to a finite energy ( 1.8  @xmath3 = 0.2  mev ) .",
    "this second magnon gap is small , and therefore it is not visible in the neutron scattering , but it is clearly seen in the esr studies .",
    "the principal axes of the anisotropy tensor were constrained by symmetry considerations ( see appendix a ) , but can not be determined uniquely . in order to reconcile our results with the magnetization measurements on a twinned crystal @xcite and with the neutron diffraction results @xcite , where the spin orientation was measured , the easy direction ( the @xmath78 axis of the reference frame ) was selected so that it makes a @xmath117 angle to the @xmath118 plane ( see fig .",

    "they may cause some modes to shift from zero to finite frequencies @xcite , but do not change the number of modes . the comparison with other triangular magnets having antiferromagnetic coupling _ within _",

    "three sublattices are definitely present .",
    "this is not supposed to be the case in nanio@xmath18 where there is strong support that the coupling within the triangular layers is ferromagnetic ( the curie - weiss temperature is positive and the neutron diffraction patterns correspond to a a type antiferromagnet with ferromagnetically aligned spins in the layers @xcite ) .",
    "however the sign of the interactions in the triangular planes has been the subject of intense debate in the isomorphic compound linio@xmath18 @xcite . even for nanio@xmath18 a recent calculation by vernay _",
    "et al _ @xcite proposes that one out of three interactions bond in the triangles are antiferromagnetic leading to antiferromagnetic chains , although this magnetic structure has not been observed experimentally .",
    "more over , in the intermediate compound li@xmath124na@xmath125nio@xmath18 @xcite , which , on the orbital sector , behaves as linio@xmath18 and , on the spin sector , presents a long range antiferromagnetic order as in nanio@xmath18 , we also observe the occurrence of three modes at zero field ( around 0 , 5.2 and 6.5  @xmath126 ) ; there the magnetic structure has not been solved yet .",
