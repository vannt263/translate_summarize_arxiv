    "detailed cosmological observations made during the last decade ( see  @xcite for some of the latest results ) have made it clear that the minimal cosmological model ( scdm ) based on the cosmological principle ( homogeneity , isotropy , validity of general relativity ) and with a purely radiation and matter content ( baryonic and cold dark matter ( cdm ) ) , is inconsistent with observations .",
    "the simplest extension of scdm able to reconcile it with the observed accelerated cosmic expansion ( ) involves the existence of a homogeneous , constant in time energy density that constitutes about @xmath11 of the total energy density of the universe and is known as the _ cosmological constant _  @xcite .",
    "a time - dependent generalization of this energy has been dubbed _",
    "dark energy_. the repulsive gravitational properties of the cosmological constant dominate on large scales and may induce the observed acceleration . due to its simplicity and its consistency with most cosmological observations is currently the _ standard _ cosmological model , replacing scdm , which held that status in the early 90 s , when observational data were far less extensive and accurate .",
    "however , is also faced with some challenges , which originate from both theoretical and observational considerations .",
    "the two main theoretical challenges of the model are _ fine tuning _ and _",
    "lack of theoretical motivation_. indeed , in order to make the model consistent with observations , the energy scale of the cosmological constant must be fine - tuned to an unnaturally small value , @xmath12 orders of magnitude smaller than the one anticipated from theoretical models of quantum field theory  @xcite .    from the observational point of view , even though is in agreement with the vast majority of data , there is a set of observations that appear to be mildly inconsistent with the model at the @xmath13 level .",
    "most of these observations , which we proceed to summarize , seem to be related to the existence of a preferred cosmological axis :    * * planarity and alignment of the cmb low multipole moments : * it has been known since 2003  @xcite ( see  @xcite for recent reviews ) that the quadrupole and octopole components of the cmb temperature perturbation maps ( the largest scale part of those maps ) are dominated by planar features which are unnaturally aligned with each other in the direction ( perpendicular to the planes ) @xmath14  @xcite . the probability that such combination of planarity and alignment occurs in a random gaussian map is less than @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "this peculiar feature has been attributed to a posteriori considerations  @xcite , namely _ within a large number of features of a map , it is statistically anticipated that some of them will present large statistical fluctuations_. this type of argument would be stronger if the large fluctuations affected random uncorrelated features ( for example multipoles with @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) . in that case",
    "we would have an a posteriori arbitrary selection of features .",
    "the quadrupole - octopole moments , however , constitute _ all _ the information we have about the cmb temperature fluctuation maps on the largest angular scales .",
    "thus the observed alignment could also be restated by saying that _ the large scale features of the cmb maps are significantly more planar than anticipated for random gaussian maps_. the fact that the _ preferred _ plane is relatively close to the galactic plane ( which is usually masked due to noise , before the construction of the power spectrum is made ) is probably responsible  @xcite for the relatively low values of the angular power spectrum components @xmath18 , @xmath19 , which is considered by some authors to be an independent puzzle  @xcite . * * large scale velocity bulk flows : * recent studies  @xcite have detected a large scale flow with a bulk velocity in the range @xmath20 $ ]  km / s towards @xmath21 on scales @xmath22 .",
    "this detection is larger than the prediction and inconsistent with it at the level of @xmath23 . * * large scale alignment in the qso optical polarization data : * quasar polarization vectors are not randomly oriented over the sky with a probability often in excess of 99.9% .",
    "the alignment effect seems to be prominent along a particular axis with direction @xmath24  @xcite . * * profiles of cluster haloes : * predicts shallow , low concentration and density profiles , in contrast to some observations which point to denser cluster haloes  @xcite .",
    "as announced , three of the above four puzzles are large - scale effects related to preferred cosmological directions ( cmb multipole alignments , qso polarization alignment and large scale bulk flows ) ; those directions , moreover , appear to be not far from each other , being approximately normal to the axis of the ecliptic poles @xmath25 and lying close to the ecliptic plane and the equinoxes .",
    "this coincidence has triggered investigations for possible systematic effects related to the cmb preferred axis but no significant such effects have been found  @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that , in addition to the discussed large - scale effects , the model also faces some issues on galactic scales ( missing satellites problem  @xcite and the cusp / core nature of the central density profiles of dwarf galaxies  @xcite ) .    in spite of those problems ,",
    "the construction of generalizations of has been motivated so far mainly by theoretical rather than observational considerations .",
    "some of the most popular ideas among those that go beyond are the following :    * * time dependent dark energy  @xcite : * within this approach , dark energy retains its homogeneous and isotropic character , but may present a time dependence .",
    "this time dependence aims at solving ( or at least alleviating ) the previously mentioned fine - tuning problem , i.e. the unnaturally small value of the current dark energy required by the observations .",
    "indeed , it turns out that a dark energy density which is larger at early times and evolves via proper dynamics to its present low value is easier to accommodate in theoretical models .",
    "a representative of this class of models is _ quintessence _ , where the role of dark energy is played by a dynamically evolving scalar field .",
    "however , for this evolution to be consistent with the observations , the scalar field must be assigned an extremely ( fine - tuned ) small mass , fact that makes the additional complexity introduced in this class of models be of questionable value .",
    "* * modified gravity : * the repulsive gravity provided by the cosmological constant on large scales can also be induced by modifications of general relativity in the context of a homogeneous and isotropic background .",
    "several such modifications have been suggested , including scalar tensor gravity  @xcite , dgp models that involve gravitons leaking through large extra dimensions  @xcite , @xmath26 gravity  @xcite etc .",
    "these models are well motivated as complete geometric physical theories , but they have more degrees of freedom than and they also require significant fine - tuning in order to be consistent with both the observed cosmic accelerating expansion and the gravitational solar system constraints that prevent large local departures from general relativity . * * inhomogeneous and isotropic lemaitre - tolman - bondi void models  @xcite : * within this framework , an additional dark energy component is not needed to secure consistency with the cosmological data that indicate accelerating expansion .",
    "the basic idea that lies behind them is to consider that the increased expansion rate occurs locally in space rather than at recent cosmological times , a fact that can be achieved by assuming a locally - reduced matter energy density  @xcite .",
    "thus , the observer is placed close to the center of a giant void with dimensions of a few gpc  @xcite . even though this approach is free of dark energy , it is by no means free of fine tuning . apart from the unnatural assumption of giant - size gpc voids , which are very unlikely to be produced in any cosmology , these models require the observer to be placed within a very small volume at the center of the void ( about @xmath27 of the total volume of the void ) . a slightly off - center observer , however , will naturally experience a preferred cosmological direction ( towards the center of the void ) , which may help to resolve some of the observational puzzles of discussed above .    in the present study we consider yet an alternative approach for the generalization of . instead of breaking the time translation invariance of dark energy , as in the class of quintessence models , we break its space translation invariance ( homogeneity ) .",
    "we thus consider a spherically symmetric overdensity of dark energy with typical scale of a few gpc : _ inhomogeneous dark energy ( ide)_. this class of models adds degrees of freedom to in a manner that is generically different from the other three classes considered above .",
    "thus , it also has specific advantages as compared to them .",
    "in particular :    * * physical mechanism : * there is a well - defined _ physical mechanism _ that can produce this type of spherically symmetric , hubble - scale ide . it is based on applying the principles of _ topological inflation _",
    "@xcite to the case of late - time acceleration .",
    "according to the idea of topological inflation , the false vacuum energy of the core of a topological defect can give rise to accelerating expansion if the core size reaches the hubble scale when gravity starts dominating the dynamics .",
    "thus , for example , a recently formed global monopole with appropriate scale of symmetry breaking and coupling could naturally produce a hubble - scale , spherically symmetric , isocurvature dark energy overdensity . by analogy with topological inflation , this mechanism may be called _ topological quintessence_. * * naturally large scale : * whereas matter inhomogeneities ( voids ) of a few gpc are very unlikely to be formed through large scale structure mechanisms , ide on hubble scales is more natural and easy to construct . in the ide case ( also in contrast to inhomogeneous matter models ) , the homogeneous limit ( ) is consistent with observations and one interesting question is _ ` what is the smallest scale of inhomogeneity for which this consistency remains?'_. * * more natural off - center observers ( less fine tuning ) : * due to the arbitrarily large scale of ide ( supported by observations , as we will see ) , there is less fine tuning for the location of the observer with respect to the center of the spherical inhomogeneity . in fact , as the inhomogeneity scale approaches the horizon the model becomes indistinguishable from and there is no observational constraint for the location of the observer . *",
    "* natural generation of a preferred cosmological axis : * as we have seen , most of the observational challenges of hint towards the existence of a preferred cosmological direction .",
    "such a direction is naturally provided for an off - center observer in an inhomogeneous matter or dark energy model : _ the direction that connects the location of the observer with the center of the inhomogeneity_. the displacement of the observer naturally leads to an alignment of low cmb multipole moments and bulk velocity flows .",
    "the additional degrees of freedom ( with respect to ) introduced in this class of models are similar to the corresponding ones in models that break the time translation invariance of dark energy .",
    "we also need a scalar field , but now with spatial rather than temporal dependence .",
    "compared to matter void models , however , the ide setup requires more ( and less natural ) degrees of freedom .",
    "this is the price to pay for the reduction in the amount of fine tuning .",
    "the goal of the present study is to investigate some of the observational consequences and constraints of ide models .",
    "we focus on the constraints coming from snia data and the cmb low multipole moments .",
    "we also discuss the physical mechanism that could give rise to ide ( _ topological quintessence _ ) , although we postpone a complete analysis of this mechanism for a future study  @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following : in the next section we derive the cosmological equations , light - like geodesics and luminosity distance for on and off - center observers in the presence of ide .",
    "we also discuss the basics of topological quintessence as a mechanism for producing inhomogeneous dark energy and derive the angular dependence of the cmb temperature fluctuations induced by the shift of the observer from the center of the inhomogeneity . in section 3",
    "we use the predicted luminosity distance to constrain the model parameters using the union2 snia data  @xcite . in the same section",
    "we compare the values of the low multipole moments ( dipole , quadrupole ) of cmb perturbations induced by the displacement of the observer from the center to the corresponding observed values and derive constraints on the parameters of the model .",
    "finally , in section 4 we conclude and discuss the implications and possible extensions of our results . in what follows",
    "we fix the present age of the universe to @xmath28gyr . in the best fit model",
    ", this would correspond to fixing @xmath29km/(smpc ) .",
    "we also refer to a comoving radial distance simply as ` distance ' .",
    "the line element of an expanding , spherically symmetric spacetime is given by the lemaitre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) metric  @xcite : @xmath30 we consider a spherically symmetric energy - momentum tensor : t_^= ( -(r)-_m(r , t),p_r(r),p_t(r),p_t(r ) ) [ enmom ] where @xmath31 is the matter density and we have allowed for a general inhomogeneous and spherically symmetric static fluid with : ( t_f)_^= ( -(r),p_r(r),p_t(r),p_t(r ) ) [ enmommon ] ( being @xmath32 the transverse pressure ) .",
    "this expression is motivated by the energy - momentum of a global monopole , which asymptotically is of the form  @xcite : ( t_mon)_^= ( -/r^2,-/r^2,0,0 ) [ tmnmonas ] with @xmath33 the symmetry - breaking scale related to the formation of the monopole .",
    "the einstein equations @xmath34 may be obtained from equations ( [ ltbmet ] ) , ( [ enmom ] ) and read :    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    and @xmath38    the primes and dots denote derivatives with respect to @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "( [ yht10 ] ) leads to : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant of integration depending only on the coordinate @xmath39 and @xmath43 is a function associated with the spatial curvature .",
    "thus , the ltb metric ( [ ltbmet ] ) takes the form : @xmath44 taking ( [ ltbmet2 ] ) to ( [ yht11 ] ) we obtain : [ freq1 ] ^2 + 2 a + k(r ) = - 8 g p_r(r ) a^2 , which implies accelerating expansion for negative pressure and proper curvature profile .",

    "note that the profile of the inhomogeneous dark energy pressure , @xmath54 , is in principle arbitrary , being determined by the physical mechanism that induced the inhomogeneous overdensity .",
    "the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor ( [ enmommon ] ) leads to the equations : [ conenmomr ] + ( + p_r ) + ( + p_t)&= & 0 , + p_r + ( p_r - p_t)&= & 0.[conenmomp ] in the special case of isotropic pressure ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 we obtain the homogeneous dark energy model which has been well studied .",
    "in what follows we will assume the presence of anisotropic pressure .",
    "a physical model that can give rise to an energy - momentum tensor of the form ( [ enmommon ] ) is a global monopole with a hubble - scale core embedded in an expanding spacetime .",

    "in fact there have been recent claims about detection  @xcite of spatial variation of the fine structure constant along a particular direction in the sky .    by varying the action ( [ gmaction ] ) with respect to the metric and with respect to the scalar field",

    "<S> we consider on - center and off - center observers in an inhomogeneous , spherically symmetric , isocurvature ( flat ) concentration of dark energy with typical size of a few gpc . </S>",

    "<S> as expected , the best - fit fractional dark energy density at the center , @xmath3 , approaches the corresponding value @xmath4 for large enough values of the inhomogeneity radius @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) . using the union2 data , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the maximum allowed shift @xmath7 of the observer from the center of the inhomogeneity is about @xmath8 which respects the copernican principle . </S>",
    "<S> the model naturally predicts the existence of a preferred axis and alignment of the low cmb multipoles . </S>",
    "<S> however , the constraints on @xmath7 coming from the magnitude of the cmb dipole remain a severe challenge to the copernican principle and lead to @xmath9 even for an inhomogeneity radius as large as @xmath10 . </S>"
