    "the material derivative is discretized along the characteristic curve , which originates the robustness for convection - dominated problems .",
    "although , as a result of the discretization along the characteristic curve , a composite function term at the previous time appears , it is converted to the right - hand side in the system of the linear equations .",
    "thus , the coefficient matrix in the left - hand side is symmetric , which allows us to use efficient linear solvers for symmetric matrices such as the conjugate gradient method and the minimal residual method @xcite .",

    "all these theoretical results are derived under the condition that the integration of the composite function term is computed exactly . since , in real problems",
    ", it is difficult to get the exact integration value , numerical quadrature is usually employed .",
    "it is , however , reported that instability may occur caused by numerical quadrature error in @xcite .",
    "that is , the theoretical stability results may collapse by the introduction of numerical quadrature .",
    "several methods have been studied to avoid the instability .",
    "the map of a particle from a time to the previous time along the trajectory , which is nothing but to solve a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , is simplified in @xcite .",
    "morton  priestley ",
    "suli @xcite solved the odes only at the centroids of the elements , and priestley @xcite did only at the vertices of the elements .",
    "the map of the other points is approximated by linear interpolation of those values .",
    "it becomes possible to perform the exact integration of the composite function term with the simplified map .",
    "saavedra @xcite used the same simplified map as @xcite to employ a numerical quadrature of high accuracy to the composite function term .",
    "tabata @xcite approximated the map by a locally linearized velocity and the backward euler approximation for the solution of the odes in @xmath5-element .",
    "the approximate map makes possible the exact integration of the composite function term with the map .",
    "tabata @xcite used mass lumping in @xmath5-element to develop a scheme free from quadrature for convection - diffusion problems .    in this paper",
    "we prove the stability and convergence for the scheme with the same approximate map as @xcite in @xmath6-element for convection - diffusion problems .",
