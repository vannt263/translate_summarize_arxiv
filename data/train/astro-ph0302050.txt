    "ngc 253 has an outflow caused by starbursts in its central regions @xcite .",
    "being almost edge - on and one of the closest starburst galaxies , with a distance of @xmath1 mpc @xcite , it is one of the best examples for studying the structure of such outflows .",
    "@xcite found sio emission components whose velocities imply that the molecular gas is flowing out of the disk .",
    "the sio emission is most likely caused by shocks .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission also traces the excited molecular gas ( e.g , sugai et al .",
    "2000 , 1999 , 1997 ) , including shocked gas .",
    "tanaka et al.s ( 1994 ) results showed that a search for extended h@xmath0 emission would be fruitful , although their spatial resolution was not enough to discuss its morphology . in this letter",
    "we report our high spatial resolution fabry - perot imaging from ukirt of the h@xmath2 s(1 ) emission in this galaxy .",
    "we also show a _ hubble space telescope _ narrow - band image , which was obtained from archive data ( prop i d 7218 : rieke , m. ) , to emphasize the apparently sharply delineated components of the extended h@xmath0 emission .",
    "we obtained line images in the h@xmath2 s(1 ) transition using a fabry - perot imager mounted on the cassegrain focus of the ukirt 3.8 m telescope on mauna kea hawaii on 1996 december 19 .",
    "a _ k_-band etalon with 50 mm effective aperture made by queensgate instruments was set in a collimated beam . a cooled narrow band filter ( 0.9% )",
    "was used for sorting one order of interference .",
    "we used the near - infrared camera , ircam3 , which has a 256 @xmath3 256 insb array , with a pixel scale of @xmath4 .",
    "wavelength calibration was carried out using a krypton lamp .",
    "the spectral resolution was 325 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the peak transmission at the target object position was set to its systemic velocity , @xmath6 km s@xmath5 ( e.g. , da costa et al . 1991 ) .",
    "although the fabry - perot provided an unvignetted field of approximately @xmath7 in diameter for this velocity , the rotation of ngc 253 may have caused loss of some h@xmath0 flux in its receding southwestern edge .",
    "however , this only affects the farthest part of the image and does not alter the discussion in this letter . for each line image , we repeated the following observing sequence : ( 1 ) line frame , ( 2 ) continuum frame , ( 3 ) line frame again , and ( 4 ) continuum frame on the opposite side of the line .",
    "the same observing sequence was carried out for sky frames .",
    "two sets of such sequences provided a total on - line integration time of 12 minutes on the source .",
    "after sky subtraction from each object frame by the corresponding wavelength sky frame , we carried out flat fielding by using sky frames at the same wavelength setting .",
    "a transmittance correction , which included atmospheric absorption and the transmittance of the order - sorting filters , was made using the a3 v standard star bs  232 observed at a similar time and air mass and at the same wavelength setting .",
    "we also retrieved _ hst _ nicmos archive data .",
    "images through narrow - band filters f212n ( @xmath8 m ; @xmath9 ) and f215n ( @xmath10 m ; @xmath9 ) were used to create a h@xmath2 s(1 ) line image , although the continuum subtraction is less accurate than the fabry - perot data .",
    "we also use _ hst _ wfpc2 archive data of f814w broad - band filter imaging .",
    "figure  [ h2cont ] shows the spatial distribution of the h@xmath0 emission obtained with the ukirt fabry - perot .",
    "strong h@xmath0 emission is associated with the continuum emission , which traces the disk stellar distribution . however",
    ", more extended h@xmath0 emission is also detected .",
    "features found in our fabry - perot data are consistently seen also in the _ hst _ nicmos image .",
    "we call the apparently `` filamentary '' features a , b , c , and d. features b and d are more clearly recognized in the _ hst _ image since the contrast of these sharp features against nearby h@xmath0 emission is higher . feature",
    "a extends southeast to a height of at least @xmath11 .",
    "the apparently narrow features a and b , and possibly also c , are tightly related to the intense hot plasma observed by @xcite and @xcite in soft ( 0.21.5 kev ) x - rays : these h@xmath0 emission features are found at the _ edges _ of the hot plasma ( figure  [ x ] ) .",
    "they trace the expected places for an interaction between a superwind and its surrounding molecular gas .",
    "@xcite showed that the x - ray emitting gas distribution is consistent with a conical outflow , although it may depend on the observed energy band whether or not the conical outflow has a hollow structure @xcite .",
    "since it is unlikely that the filaments accidentally occur exactly and only at our tangential line of sight to the hot plasma outflow , we propose that ( at our spatial resolution ) the h@xmath0 emission structures consist of a more or less bi - conical shell - like structure around the outflow ; and that the `` filaments \" in fact trace the tangential line of sight to this h@xmath0 emission shell .",
    "although the shell may be inhomogeneous and , for example , may actually consist of many unresolved filaments embedded in a less dense sheet , even in this case it is unlikely that those filaments exist only at our line of sight .",
    "the hot plasma outflow is tilted with respect to the axis perpendicular to the disk , when it leaves the disk plane , as found in the outflow of m82 by @xcite .",
    "the position angles of `` filamentary \" features a , b , c , and d on the plane of the sky are offset from the disk minor axis direction roughly by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively , towards the northeast side of the disk .",
    "the apparent offset seems larger on the northeast side , i.e. , for features b and c , compared with features a and d. the tilt of the outflow may relate to the inhomogeneous nature of the interstellar medium in which the starburst takes place .",
    "@xcite discusses why the interstellar medium must be inhomogeneous in the vicinity of the starburst .",
    "if it was uniform dense gas , most of the initial kinetic energy of individual supernova remnants and stellar - wind - blown bubbles would be lost to radiation before being used for the heating to produce a superbubble .",
    "from where does the h@xmath0 molecular gas in features a , b , c , and d originate ? there are four possibilities : ( 1 ) h@xmath0 reproduction from the hot plasma , ( 2 ) molecular gas blown out by superwinds , ( 3 ) molecular gas at the same height but that has been swept to the side as the superwind expanded , and ( 4 ) molecular gas which was already where it is now seen . in figure",
    "[ x ] , the h@xmath0 emission is found only around the beginning of the hot plasma outflow and is not found further out .",
    "this rules out possibility ( 1 ) because h@xmath0 reproduction would be seen almost everywhere along the hot plasma edges .",
    "figure  [ hst814 ] shows an optical image from _ hst _ wfpc2 archive data .",
    "registration of this image to the near - infrared images was achieved using coordinates determined by @xcite .",
    "we use this f814w image to investigate the dust distribution , because optical images are more sensitive to dust extinction than near - infrared images .",
    "we find a bright region coincident with the x - ray plasma and apparently `` narrow `` lanes at the positions of h@xmath0 emission features a and ( less clearly ) b. this suggests that dust is lacking in the hot plasma , and instead is tightly associated at least with features a and b , although it might extend farther from the disk plane than the h@xmath0 emission features .",
    "less dust exists just outside the `` narrow '' dust lanes , suggesting that it may form a conical shell - like structure similar to the h@xmath0 emitting gas .",
    "this makes possibility ( 4 ) less likely .",
    "if dust had existed there previously , its distribution outside the hot plasma would be more homogeneous .",
    "the `` narrow \" lanes imply that the dust has been blown out or swept to the side in a similar way to the h@xmath0 emitting gas .",
    "the stronger h@xmath0 emission feature a appears to be located on the northeastern side ( i.e. inside ) of the corresponding dust lane , suggesting a stronger interaction with the superwind inside the dust shell .",
    "although from our observations alone we can not conclude which of ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is the origin of the extended h@xmath0 gas , results of theoretical works provide some insight for this ( e.g. , strickland & stevens 2000 ; williams & dyson 2002 ) .",
    "for example , @xcite suggested that the wind drags out material from the disk .",
    "the extended h@xmath0 gas in ngc  253 might correspond to this dragged - out material , which may have a contribution for collimating the wind .",
    "it is also possible that the h@xmath0 gas is being entrained by the wind while dense molecular gas remaining in the disk collimates the wind . even in this case",
    ", the base of the extended h@xmath0 gas closely traces the place of wind collimation .",
    "observations of sio emission by @xcite suggest that two sio filaments come out of the plane of the nucleus of ngc 253 . according to these authors , the velocities at the filament positions",
    "are easily accounted for if the molecular gas is outflowing .",
    "this implies that it is actually possible that a significant amount of molecular gas is coming out from the disk plane , although the positional difference between the sio filaments and the extended h@xmath0 emission features implies that they are not the same phenomenon .",
    "kinetic energies required for starburst outflows jump up by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude after the detection of dust and molecules , compared with those required only for ionized gas .",
    "this is possibly because there is so much mass associated with molecular gas phase compared to any other detectable phase .",
    "a recent example of this is discussed by @xcite in the galactic center .",
    "@xcite found spatial variation of the h@xmath16 s(1 ) / h@xmath2 s(1 ) line ratio over a half arcminute from the nucleus , although they could not resolve the extended h@xmath0 emission reported in this letter .",
    "but their results may imply spatial variation of the h@xmath0 excitation mechanisms . from slit spectroscopy , @xcite suggested that 25 % of the h@xmath2 s(1 ) emission in a central @xmath17 aperture is excited by fluorescence  but this applies only to the strong nuclear h@xmath0 emission .",
    "ideally , spectroscopy exactly at the extended h@xmath0 emission features would be needed to find the excitation mechanisms at the interface between the hot plasma and the molecular gas . however , a discussion of the energetics places some constraints on its excitation mechanisms .",
    "we measure an h@xmath0 luminosity of order @xmath18 erg s@xmath5 for feature a.    first we consider x - ray heating . while @xcite derived an unabsorbed 210 kev luminosity of @xmath19 erg s@xmath5 for a heavily absorbed source of hard x - rays embedded within the nuclear starburst region , @xcite obtained an x - ray luminosity of @xmath20 erg s@xmath5 for the x - ray plume . assuming the efficiency of converting x - rays into h@xmath2 s(1 ) emission to be @xmath21 through x - ray heating ( see draine and woods 1990 )",
    ", it seems difficult for the x - ray plume alone to provide the energy input for the h@xmath0 emission because only a small fraction ( @xmath22 0.1 ) of its x - rays would be incident on the solid angle around feature a. however , until an upper limit to the unabsorbed nuclear luminosity is established , we can not rule out the possibility that the nuclear source itself might supply enough x - rays .",
    "next we consider uv fluorescence .",
    "@xcite derived an extinction corrected ionizing photon number of @xmath23 s@xmath5 from the starbursts .",
    "taking into consideration an upper limit of 37000 k for the exciting stars @xcite and also table 5 of puxley et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , we find that of order @xmath24 erg s@xmath5 of h@xmath2 s(1 ) emission is obtained when integrated over the _",
    "sphere of radius @xmath25  pc ( for photodissociation region gas density less than @xmath26 @xmath27 ) .",
    "we used a model for clustered stars residing within a communal hii region , in which the fluorescent h@xmath0 emission originates from the edge of the giant hii region .",
    "models in which individual stars have their own fluorescent h@xmath0 emission regions can not produce large - scale structures such as feature a. since only of order one tenth of the uv flux from the starbursts in the central regions would reach the solid angle around feature a , we conclude this is not enough unless dense photodissociation region ( @xmath28 @xmath27 ) has a covering factor of an order of unity . although this may be unlikely , we can not rule out a contribution from the uv fluorescence particularly to excitation of those parts of the shells close to the disk",
    ".    shocks may more easily produce the observed h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the h@xmath0 surface brightness at feature a is of order @xmath29 erg s@xmath5 @xmath30 arcsec@xmath31 .",
    "this is easily achieved by shock models ( e.g. , burton et al .",
    "_ if _ we assume that , like the sio emission , the h@xmath0 components are shock excited , we can estimate the mass of the hot molecular gas to be @xmath325 _",
    "m_@xmath33 for each of features a and b. although it is likely that a much larger mass of cold molecular gas is associated with this hot gas , the hot gas mass itself is at least much smaller than outflowing gas / dust masses found so far : the gas mass for the sio southern filament is estimated as @xmath34 _",
    "m_@xmath33 @xcite while the dust mass for the same filament is estimated as @xmath35-@xmath36 _",
    "m_@xmath33 @xcite , when the distance of 2.6 mpc is assumed .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the hot molecular gas could have been blown out from the nuclear regions of ngc 253 .",
    "the more distant and luminous starburst galaxy ic  694 also exhibits extended h@xmath0 emission similar to that in ngc  253 .",
    "it has a bipolar ( or butterfly - like ) structure in its central regions @xcite .",
    "the distance from the nucleus of ic 694 to the starting point of this structure is @xmath37 pc ( @xmath38 ) , comparable to ngc 253 ( @xmath37 pc and @xmath39 pc for features a and b , respectively ) .",
    "the structure extends to about 300 pc from the disk .",
    "these characteristics are also apparent in ngc 253 , although the case of ic 694 seems rather larger .",
    "although even _ chandra _ may not be able to clearly resolve the nuclear x - ray emission from the hot plasma in the central regions of ic  694 , the h@xmath0 emission might , as for ngc  253 , trace the edges of the hot plasma .",
    "if so , then we can glean information about the intense hot plasma distribution at the root of the superwind without seeing it directly .",
    "we thank the staff at ukirt and the jac for their help during the observing run .",
    "the united kingdom infrared telescope is operated by the joint astronomy centre on behalf of the u.k . particle physics and astronomy research council .",
    "we thank the referee for helpful comments on improvements to the paper .",
