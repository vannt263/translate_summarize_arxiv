    "it is commonly accepted that the evolution of the hot and dense matter created in heavy - ion collisions at the rhic energies can be reasonably well described in the framework of the relativistic hydrodynamics of a perfect fluid @xcite . nevertheless , the standard hydrodynamic approach , assuming three dimensional ( 3d ) thermalization of the system , encounters severe problems concerning initial conditions .",
    "the main issue in this respect is to explain the very early thermalization time of the created system , which is required by the standard hydrodynamic models to describe the elliptic flow coefficient and the particle transverse - momentum spectra .",
    "recently a possible solution of this puzzle has been proposed by bialas et al . in @xcite . in this approach",
    "one assumes that at the very early stages the hydrodynamic description applies only to transverse degrees of freedom , where the thermalization is quite easy to achieve , while in the longitudinal direction the motion is reduced to simple parton free streeming .",
    "the thermalized , two - dimensional ( 2d ) objects corresponding to the group of particles moving with the same rapidity are called ( transverse ) clusters .",
    "originally , the idea of the purely transverse thermalization of matter created in heavy - ion collisions was introduced by heinz and wong @xcite , with the conclusion that such a model can not describe the rhic data . however , the new formulation of this concept in refs .",
    "@xcite showed that the idea of the purely transverse thermalization may be consistent with the experimental results .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the discussion of the formal aspects of the transverse - hydrodynamics model , which were first studied in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we extent formal results obtained in @xcite by including the effects of finite parton masses and quantum statistics .",
    "the relativistic hydrodynamic equations of the perfect fluid valid for transversally thermalized matter follow from the energy - momentum conservation law , @xmath0 , with the energy - momentum tensor of the form @xmath1 . \\label{tensort1}\\ ] ] here @xmath2 is the longitudinal proper time and @xmath3 describes the density of clusters in rapidity",
    ".    since clusters are 2d objects , whose thermodynamic properties should be described by the proper 2d thermodynamic variables , we introduce the quantities @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 which denote the 2d energy density , pressure , particle density , and entropy density , respectively .",
    "the essential feature of our treatment is that those variables satisfy the standard thermodynamic identities . in our considerations",
    "the number of particles is not conserved , hence , throughout the paper we restrict ourselves to the case of vanishing chemical potential , @xmath8 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the temperature .",
    "the definition of the energy - momentum tensor ( [ tensort1 ] ) includes also the two mutually orthogonal four - vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the timelike four - vector @xmath12 , defined by the equation @xmath14 describes the four - velocity of the fluid element and may be obtained from the four - vector @xmath15 by performing the lorentz boost along the @xmath16 axis with the spacetime rapidity @xmath17 the quantity @xmath18 is the normalized to unity four - velocity of the fluid element in the rest frame of the cluster and @xmath19 is the lorentz gamma factor , determined by the hydrodynamic transverse flow .    the special role played by the longitudinal direction in the transverse hydrodynamics , as the direction of the free streaming of the clusters , entails the appearance of the additional spacelike four - vector @xmath13 , which is defined by the equation @xmath20 in the rest frame of the cluster , where @xmath21 , one finds .",
    "the straightforward calculation of the components of the energy - momentum tensor in the rest frame of the fluid element ( where in addition to the condition @xmath21 we have also @xmath22 ) yields the diagonal form @xmath23 vanishing of the @xmath24 component describing the longitudinal pressure is a direct consequence of the appearance of the term @xmath25 in ( [ tensort1 ] ) and it indicates that there is no momentum transport across the cluster , which also means that there is no interaction between the clusters . furthermore , as compared to the standard hydrodynamics , the lack of the longitudinal pressure effects in a more rapid transverse expansion of the matter , since all the energy accumulated in the clusters at the very beginning of the collision has to be used for transverse acceleration only . of course , it is expected that such a situation can not last long since the collisions between partons tend to thermalize the system also in the longitudinal direction .",
    "hence , within at most few fermis after the collision , the transition from transverse to standard 3d hydrodynamics is expected .",
    "one may check by the direct calculation that the energy - momentum conservation law leads to the entropy conservation law @xmath26 whose structure is similar to that known from the standard hydrodynamics . in eq .",
    "( [ entcl ] ) we introduced the entropy current which is given by the expression @xmath27 equation ( [ entcl ] ) agrees with our expectations , since the evolution in the cluster is entropy conserving and the longitudinal expansion of clusters is just free streaming , which can not produce entropy . in other words ,",
    "the assumption that the considered system is a simple superposition of the 2d expanding perfect fluids implies directly the adiabaticity of the flow .    similarly to the standard hydrodynamics we can incorporate eq.([entcl ] ) into the energy - momentum conservation law to derive the relativistic analog of the euler equation @xmath28 in comparison with the standard hydrodynamics , an additional term proportional to @xmath25 is present in eq .",
    "( [ hydro2d ] ) . by performing projections of eq .",
    "( [ hydro2d ] ) on the four - vectors @xmath12 and @xmath29 we check that eq .",
    "( [ hydro2d ] ) contains only two independent equations .",
    "altogether with eq .",
    "( [ entcl ] ) we have a system of three independent equations for four unknown functions @xmath30 hence , as in the standard hydrodynamics , we need to add the equation of state connecting @xmath7 and @xmath11 to solve the system of hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the reduction of the number of independent equations from three to two is expected , because the evolution along the @xmath16 axis is fixed and only the transverse evolution needs to be determined .",
    "our hydrodynamic equations can be further rewritten in a different form which is more convenient for numerical calculations . in this case",
    "we use standard cylindrical coordinates , i.e. , we introduce the distance from the beam axis and the azimuthal angle , where .",
    "we also introduce the parameterization of the fluid velocity in the form @xmath31 the dynamically changing angle @xmath32 describes deviations of the flow from the radial direction .",
    "thus , it specifies the asymmetry of the flow present in the most common non - central collisions .    with the help of the variables introduced above , and using thermodynamic identities",
    "only , we obtain the explicit form of the hydrodynamic equations @xmath33 the quantity @xmath34 is the total time derivative @xmath35 it turns out that the parameter @xmath3 , treated as a constant so far , may be an arbitrary function of the spacetime rapidity @xmath36 .",
    "we can show this feature by multiplying the original energy - momentum tensor @xmath37 by @xmath38 and incorporating it into the energy - momentum conservation laws @xmath39 = 0 . \\label{tensoreta}\\ ] ] since the tensor @xmath37 is conserved , eq.([tensoreta ] ) is reduced to the equation @xmath40 which , as the straightforward calculation shows , is always fufilled .",
    "this feature indicates that our model does not have to be necessarily boost invariant , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "in fact , a closer analysis shows that different initial conditions can be applied to different clusters ( placed at different values of @xmath36 ) .",
    "this is so because the clusters do not interact and evolve independently of each other .",
    "although the full 3d thermalization of the system at the very beginning of the evolution is hard to achieve , as the system expands the thermalization in the longitudinal direction seems to be inevitable .",
    "such situation requires the transition from the transverse hydrodynamics to standard hydrodynamics .",
    "probably , the simplest description of such a transition is achieved with the assumption that it has a sudden character . in this case",
    "the transition may be realized by assuming the so called landau matching conditions at the transition point @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ lmc ] ) we used the energy - momentum tensor of the perfect fluid valid for standard hydrodynamics @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ standardtmunu ] ) the energy density @xmath43 and pressure @xmath44 are 3d thermodynamic quantities .",
    "( [ lmc ] ) , with the appropriate tensors used , may be reduced to the local conservation of the energy and momentum ( at the transition point ) @xmath45 it must be supplemented by the assumption of the entropy production associated with 2d @xmath46 3d transition , @xmath47 where we introduced the 3d entropy density @xmath48 .",
    "we note that the 2d @xmath46 3d transition has been recently addressed in the framework of the dissipative hydrodynamics in @xcite . in this framework",
    "the transition is naturally associated with the entropy production . on the other hand ,",
    "the 2d @xmath46 3d transition was also studied in refs .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the entropy - conserving anisotropic hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics , respectively .",
    "moreover , the landau matching conditions similar to those advocated above were also used recently to model a transition from the early 3d parton free streaming to 3d perfect - fluid hydrodynamics in ref . @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic variables used in the transverse hydrodynamics are obtained directly from the potential @xmath49 defined for 2d systems of non - interacting bosons ( upper signs ) or fermions ( lower signs ) @xmath50 the particles move in the transverse plane whose area is @xmath51 , and their energy is .",
    "the factor @xmath52 denotes internal degrees of freedom . in the case of gluons @xmath53 . using eq .",
    "( [ omega1 ] ) we can define particle density @xmath54 , pressure @xmath5 , entropy density @xmath55 , and energy density @xmath56 by using the standard thermodynamic definitions : @xmath57 and the relation @xmath58    simple analytic formulas may be obtained for massless fermions and bosons @xmath59 @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "for the two statistics we also find that sound velocity @xmath62 is constant and much higher than in the standard 3d hydrodynamics , namely @xmath63 in the case of the boltzmann statistics , the analytic expressions can be derived also for finite masses @xmath64 e ^ { -m / t } , \\label{es2 } \\\\ \\varepsilon_2 & = & \\frac { \\nu _ g t } { 2\\pi } [ t^2+(m+t)^2 ] e ^ { -m / t } .",
