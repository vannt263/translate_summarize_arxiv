    "with its giant outburst in 1997 , emitting photons up to @xmath5  tev and @xmath6  mev in the @xmath7-ray and x - ray bands , mkn  501 has proved to be the most extreme tev - blazar observed so far ( e.g. catanese et al 1997 , pian et al 1997 , aharonian et al 1999 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the april 1997 flare of mkn  501 in the light of a modified version of the synchrotron proton blazar model ( spb ) ( mannheim 1993 ) , and present a preliminary model fit .    in the model ,",
    "shock accelerated protons ( @xmath1 ) interact in the synchrotron photon field generated by the electrons ( @xmath0 ) co - accelerated at the same shock .",
    "this scenario may put constraints on the maximum achievable particle energies .",
    "the usual process considered for accelerating charged particles in the plasma jet is diffusive shock acceleration ( see e.g. drury 1983 , biermann & strittmatter 1987 ) .",
    "if the particle spectra are cut off due to synchrotron losses , the ratio of the maximum particle energies @xmath8 can be derived by equating @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the synchrotron loss time scales for @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we find that for shocks of compression ratio 4 ( see mcke & protheroe 1999 for a detailed derivation ) @xmath12 where the `` = ' ' -sign corresponds to synchrotron loss , and the `` @xmath13''-sign to adiabatic loss determining the maximum energies .",
    "@xmath14 is the power law index of the magnetic turbulence spectrum ( @xmath15 : kolmogorov turbulence , @xmath16 : kraichnan turbulence , and @xmath17 corresponds to bohm diffusion ) .",
    "@xmath18 is the mean free path at maximum energy in units of the particle s gyroradius and @xmath19 takes account of the shock angle @xmath20 ( jokipii 1987 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath21 can be constrained by the variability time scale @xmath22 , requiring @xmath23 ( @xmath24 = doppler factor , @xmath25 = acceleration time scale at maximum particle energy ) for a given parameter combination . as an example , we adopt @xmath26 , @xmath27 g and @xmath28  days .",
    "1 then restricts for these parameters the ratio of the allowed maximum particle energies to the range below the solid lines shown in fig .  1 .",
    "points exactly on this line correspond to synchrotron - loss limited particle spectra which are accelerated with exactly the variability time scale .",
    "[ fig1 ]    in hadronic models @xmath29 photoproduction is essential for @xmath7-ray production .",
    "the threshold of this process is given by @xmath30  gev where @xmath31 is the maximum photon energy of the synchrotron target field .",
    "inserting @xmath32 into the threshold condition , we find    @xmath33 which is shown in fig .  1 as dashed line for various magnetic field strengths . together with eq .  1 , the allowed range of maximum particle energies",
    "is then restricted to the shaded area in fig .  1 .",
    "we assume the parameters used in fig .  1 , and that the co - accelerated @xmath0 produce the synchrotron spectrum , unlike in previous spb models , and this is the target radiation field for the @xmath34-interactions .",
    "this synchrotron spectrum , and its hardening with rising flux , has recently been convincingly reproduced by a shock model with escape and synchrotron losses ( kirk et al 1998 ) .",
    "we use the monte - carlo technique for particle production / cascade development , which allows us to use exact cross sections .      for simplicity",
    "we represent the observed synchrotron spectrum ( target photon field for the @xmath34-collisions ) as a broken power law in the jet frame with photon power law index 1.4 below the break energy of 0.2  kev , and index 1.8 up to 50  kev .",
    "the variability time scale restricts the radius @xmath35 of the emission region . for our model",
    "we use @xmath36  days ( catanese et al 1997 ) , and find @xmath37 cm for @xmath26 , @xmath38  g. with these parameters the @xmath39-pair production optical depth reaches unity for @xmath40  tev photons .",
    "our model considers photomeson production ( simulated using sophia , mcke et al 1999 ) , bethe - heitler pair production ( simulated using the code of protheroe & johnson 1996 ) , @xmath1 synchrotron radiation and adiabatic losses due to jet expansion .",
    "the mean energy loss and acceleration time scales are presented in fig .",
    "synchrotron losses , which turn out to be at least as important as losses due to @xmath29 photoproduction for the assumed 2  day variability , limit the injected @xmath1 spectrum @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "this leads to a @xmath1 energy density @xmath43 , which is bracketed by the photon energy density @xmath44 , and a magnetic field energy density @xmath45 . with @xmath46 significant inverse compton radiation from the co -",
    "accelerated @xmath0 is not expected .",
    "rachen & meszaros ( 1998 ) noted the importance of synchrotron losses of @xmath4- ( and @xmath47- ) prior to their decay in agn jets and grbs .",
    "for the present model , the critical lorentz factors @xmath48 and @xmath49 , above which synchrotron losses dominate above decay , lie well below the maximum particle energy for @xmath4 , while @xmath47-synchrotron losses can be neglected due to the shorter decay time .    the matrix method",
    "( e.g. protheroe & johnson 1996 ) is used to follow the pair - synchrotron cascade in the ambient synchrotron radiation field and magnetic field , developing as a result of photon - photon pair production .",
    "the cascade can be initiated by photons from @xmath2-decay ( `` @xmath2-cascade '' ) , electrons from the @xmath50-decay ( `` @xmath47-cascade '' ) , @xmath51 from the proton - photon bethe - heitler pair production ( `` bethe - heitler - cascade '' ) and @xmath1 and @xmath52-synchrotron photons ( `` @xmath1-synchrotron cascade '' and `` @xmath4-synchrotron cascade '' ) . in this model ,",
    "the cascades develop linearly .",
    "3 shows an example of cascade spectra initiated by photons of different origin , and for the parameter combination given above . @xmath2- and @xmath47-cascades obviously produce featureless spectra whereas @xmath1- and @xmath4-synchrotron cascades cause the typical double hump shaped sed as observed in @xmath7-ray blazars ( see also rachen , these proceedings ) .",
    "the contribution from bethe - heitler cascades turns out to be negligible .",
    "direct @xmath1- and @xmath4-synchrotron radiation is responsible for the high energy peak , whereas the low energy hump may be either synchrotron radiation from the directly accelerated @xmath0 and/or by pairs produced by the `` low energy hump '' .    adding the four components of the cascade spectrum in fig .  3 and normalizing to an ambient , accelerated @xmath1 density of @xmath53",
