    "<S> we report the cooling of electrons in nanoelectronic coulomb blockade thermometers below @xmath0 . above @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the devices are in good thermal contact with the environment , well isolated from electrical noise , and not susceptible to self - heating . </S>",
    "<S> this is attributed to an optimised design that incorporates cooling fins with a high electron - phonon coupling and on - chip electronic filters , combined with a low - noise electronic measurement setup . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath1 the electron temperature is seen to diverge from the ambient temperature . by immersing a coulomb blockade thermometer in the @xmath2he/@xmath3he refrigerant of a dilution refrigerator </S>",
    "<S> , we measure a lowest electron temperature of @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> cooling nanoelectronic structures to millikelvin temperatures presents extreme challenges in maintaining thermal contact between the electrons in the device and an external cold bath @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is typically found that the electrons in a nanoelectronic device cooled even to @xmath5 are significantly overheated . </S>",
    "<S> understanding how to obtain and measure electron temperatures approaching @xmath6 will open a new regime for studying nanoelectronics , and pave the way towards pioneering sub - millikelvin techniques . ] </S>",
    "<S> this would benefit , for example , investigations of the fractional quantum hall effect in 2d electron gases@xcite , and solid - state quantum technologies including superconducting and semiconducting qubits . </S>",
    "<S> to access these temperatures , one must minimise parasitic heating and internal joule heating , maximise the coupling to cold contact wires and phonons in the host lattice , all the while overcoming the decrease in electron - phonon coupling and electrical heat conduction as temperatures drop .    here </S>",
    "<S> we study coulomb blockade thermometers ( cbts ) that have been designed to operate significantly below @xmath7 and demonstrate cooling of electrons in a nanoelectronic device below @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this was achieved using cbts as a diagnostic tool to quantify and optimise the thermal environment of the electrons in the device . </S>",
    "<S> a cbt consists of an array of coulomb - blockaded metallic islands connected by tunnel junctions whose conductance is temperature dependent@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cbts typically function over a decade of temperature and have previously been demonstrated to work at temperatures as low as @xmath8@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps most importantly , they can be viewed as a primary thermometer of their internal electron temperature .     </S>",
    "<S> metallic islands of capacitance @xmath9 connected in an array by tunnel junctions of resistance @xmath10 , as shown in the circuit diagram . </S>",
    "<S> connection to the array is made via on - chip @xmath11 filters comprising a meandering electrode sandwiched between large - area grounded metal films , separated by @xmath12 @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> each filter has a distributed resistance @xmath14 and capacitance @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the schematic cross - section ( right ) shows one tunnel junction connecting two islands , with au thermalisation blocks on top . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ]    the structure of the cbts studied here is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> devices are fabricated using an ex situ tunnel junction process@xcite that provides excellent tunnel junction uniformity@xcite , and has also been used to fabricate superconducting qubits@xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> the cbts are made from al films with a thickness @xmath12 and an isolating layer of @xmath12 @xmath13 deposited by pecvd . </S>",
    "<S> the tunnel junctions have a nominal diameter @xmath16 and a resistivity @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the substrate is undoped si with @xmath18 thermal oxide on the surface .    </S>",
    "<S> efficient thermalisation of electrons and phonons in the metallic islands of the cbt is critical for reaching low electron temperatures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - phonon heat flow @xmath19 is described by the material - dependent electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath20 and the volume of the metallic island @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the electron temperature and @xmath24 is the phonon temperature@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to minimise @xmath23 , the island volume should be large and the material chosen to maximise @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the island thickness achievable with the ex situ tunnel junction process , or other deposition techniques used for tunnel junction devices , is typically up to @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> thicker films suffer from stress build - up , causing poor adhesion between the film and the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> this is a severe problem at mk temperatures where poor adhesion can lead to poor thermalisation and even mechanical failure due to thermal motion during cool - down . </S>",
    "<S> we avoid these problems by using a combination of the ex situ process followed by masked electroplating of au on top of the cbt islands@xcite , which we refer to as thermalisation blocks . </S>",
    "<S> electroplating can produce @xmath26 thick , low stress films , and here we choose a nominal thickness of @xmath27 for the thermalisation blocks . </S>",
    "<S> the effective electron - phonon coupling in these islands , with nominal volume @xmath28 and a high coupling constant@xcite in au @xmath29 , is estimated to be more than two orders of magnitude larger than in previous cbts fabricated using the ex situ junction process@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the thermalisation of the cbt itself it is important to thermalise the incoming leads through robust thermal anchoring and heavy electromagnetic filtering@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we improve the chain of thermalisation and filtering by including on - chip resistive meander structures in line with all electrical contacts . </S>",
    "<S> these form a distributed resistive - capacitive chain with a cut - off frequency of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> similar filters based on a large area capacitor and tunnel junctions in series have previously been incorporated in a cbt @xcite .     and @xmath1 combining measurements made in two dilution refrigerators . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) cbt conductance @xmath31 versus measured bias voltage @xmath32 at four temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> symbols show measured values and lines show best fits to the calculated ideal conductance ( see text for details of fitting ) . </S>",
    "<S> the warmest measurements ( crosses , circles and squares ) are fitted simultaneously to calibrate the sensor , giving @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the coldest measurement ( triangles ) was fitted using this calibration . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum electron temperatures @xmath35 are in close agreement with the refrigerator temperature measured by the @xmath36 thermometer : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) cbt electron temperature @xmath41 vs refrigerator temperature @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> symbols show @xmath35 from fits to conductance dips measured in the cryogen - free refrigerator ( circles ) and the custom refrigerator ( triangles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line shows @xmath41 determined by monitoring the conductance at @xmath43 as the cryo - free fridge cooled over @xmath44 , showing that the cbt has a stronger thermal link to the refrigerator than the @xmath36 thermometer , leading to the thermal lag ( @xmath45 ) during this time . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ]    figure  [ fig2 ] shows the behaviour of a cbt , fabricated using the process described above , focusing on temperatures between @xmath1 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the sensor was measured in a commercial cryogen - free dilution refrigerator with a base temperature @xmath47 and later in a custom dilution refrigerator manufactured at lancaster university@xcite with a base temperature @xmath48 ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance of the cbt was measured in a current - driven four - wire configuration , with the drive current and voltage amplification provided by an aivon pa10 amplifier . a small ac excitation ( typically @xmath49 ) </S>",
    "<S> was added to the dc bias @xmath50 , allowing the differential conductance @xmath31 to be measured with a lock - in amplifier .    as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) , the cbt conductance dips around zero bias , and the dip becomes deeper and narrower at lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> its full - width at half maximum is related to temperature by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the number of tunnel junctions in series  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this does not account for self - heating in the sensor and so is only applicable when @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> a more practical parameter to determine temperature is the zero - bias conductance @xmath54 , which has an approximate analytic relation to temperature  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is dimensionless inverse temperature , @xmath57 e^2/c_\\sigma$ ] is the charging energy of the system , @xmath9 is the total capacitance of each island , and @xmath58 is the asymptotic conductance . when @xmath59 the temperature measurement error is @xmath60%@xcite . thus , if @xmath9 and @xmath58 are known it is possible to determine @xmath61 by measuring only @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the most complete method to determine temperature is using a full tunnelling model to calculate @xmath62 numerically  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use this last approach to find @xmath9 and @xmath58 for the device in order to then determine the temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations of conductance are made using an algorithm derived from the free , open - source library pycbt  . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we account for overheating in the sensor by predicting the electron temperature @xmath63 in the islands using a model for the heat flow into each island , @xmath64 where the first term is joule heating at tunnel junctions of resistance @xmath10 , the second term is heat flow to phonons , and @xmath65 accounts for parasitic heating . for a given phonon temperature , the minimum electron temperature @xmath66 is found at @xmath67 . if @xmath65 is small , then @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2](a ) shows the result of fitting the calculated @xmath62 simultaneously to three measurements made between @xmath69 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the fit parameters are @xmath58 , @xmath9 , and @xmath71 for each measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the fit was found to be insensitive to the value of @xmath65 , and hence parasitic heating is assumed to be negligible at these temperatures . having calibrated the cbt , the fitted @xmath9 was used to fit further measurements with @xmath71 and @xmath58 as the free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> an example is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) , where the electron temperature is found to be @xmath72 at a refrigerator temperature of @xmath73 , here measured by a calibrated @xmath36 resistor .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2](b ) shows that the electron temperature measured by the cbt is in close agreement with the refrigerator temperature @xmath74 in both refrigerators between @xmath1 and @xmath46 . in the custom refrigerator </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath74 is measured using a conventional vibrating wire resonator viscometer ( vwr ) immersed in the saturated dilute phase of the @xmath2he/@xmath3he refrigerant in the mixing chamber@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this set of measurements , in both refrigerators the cbt is in vacuum and housed in a gold - plated copper package ( aivon oy sh-1 ) that is attached to the mixing chamber plate . </S>",
    "<S> the package includes rc filters with a cut - off frequency @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> electrical contacts to the cbt are thermalised in additional cold @xmath11 filters potted in eccosorb cr 124 ( aivon oy ` therma ' ) , which are also attached to the mixing chamber plate . </S>",
    "<S> the filters have a cut - off frequency @xmath76 .        </S>",
    "<S> subsequently we investigated the behaviour of the cbt below @xmath1 in the custom dilution refrigerator . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](a ) shows the electron temperature of the sensor , when in vacuum , gradually cooling below @xmath0 while the refrigerator was held at @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath63 was determined from the value of @xmath54 , which was found by measuring @xmath31 over a small range of @xmath32 ( @xmath78 ) close to @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe an extremely long equilibration time ( over @xmath79 ) but a rapid cooling of the cbt following a heating event ( a refill of the liquid helium bath that briefly heated the cbt above @xmath80 and the fridge above @xmath81 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the thermal contact between the cbt and the refrigerator is relatively strong , and that its slow cooling is due to heat leak from an external warm object .    </S>",
    "<S> a second cbt was immersed in the @xmath2he/@xmath3he refrigerant of the custom dilution refrigerator to improve thermal coupling and better isolate external sources of heating . </S>",
    "<S> a schematic of the immersion cell is shown in the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) . sintered silver blocks increase the thermal contact between the refrigerant and the cbt and contact wires . </S>",
    "<S> several sinters was attached to the sensor package , to each of the four measurement wires , and a grounding wire for the package and the @xmath11 filters . </S>",
    "<S> the immersed cbt was found to equilibrate much faster , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) , reaching @xmath82 at @xmath83 .    in order to study the cbt at @xmath84 , the time needed for the sensor to reach thermal equilibrium after a change of joule heating needs to be known . </S>",
    "<S> the inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) shows the relaxation of @xmath23 after the cbt has been heated by a large drive current for long enough to reach thermal equilibrium ( @xmath85 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent value of @xmath23 is measured by scanning close to @xmath43 , where joule heating should be negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation of @xmath23 is found to have a time constant of @xmath86 .    </S>",
    "<S> he/@xmath3he refrigerant . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) fitting to the warmest three measurements gives @xmath87 and @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted minimum electron temperatures @xmath35 for the warmest three curves are in reasonable agreement with the refrigerator temperature as measured by the vwr thermometer : @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) shows measured electron temperature in the cbt as the refrigerator cooled steadily from @xmath7 to @xmath92 over a period of 12 hours . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line shows a fit of the form @xmath93 , yielding an exponent @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> the dot - dashed line shows a best fit of @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset to ( b ) shows the measured @xmath63 as the refrigerator was temporarily cooled in single - shot mode to @xmath96 , reaching a lowest @xmath23 below @xmath4.[fig4 ] ]    figure  [ fig4](a ) shows the calibration of the immersed sensor . </S>",
    "<S> the three warmest measurements were fitted simultaneously to determine @xmath97 and @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted temperatures agree with @xmath74 to within 6% . given the agreement between the fitted @xmath66 and @xmath74 , we can assume that parasitic heating is still negligible down to @xmath7 .    the coldest measurement in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) was fitted using the above values , yielding a minimum electron temperature of @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement was made over a period of @xmath100 to ensure that the cbt was in thermal equilibrium at each value of @xmath32 . at these temperatures </S>",
    "<S> the parasitic heating of the cbt is now significant and @xmath66 does not match the refrigerator temperature of @xmath83 . in order to fit this conductance dip the thermal model , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ equ_therm ] , was used with @xmath101 , and with the parasitic heating @xmath65 and the electron - phonon coupling @xmath102 as free parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the overheating of the sensor at @xmath43 constrains the product @xmath103 ; however , the parasitic heating is not large enough to reliably separate @xmath65 and @xmath102 in the fit . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , the fits suggest that @xmath104 per island and @xmath102 is at least four times larger than expected from the nominal size of the thermalisation blocks and the literature value of @xmath20 for au@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was not possible to determine an upper bound on @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the power required to measure the cbt conductance ( @xmath105 per island due to joule heating from @xmath106 ) is much lower than our estimate of @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> as such , we believe that cbts of this type can be operated at still lower temperatures by reducing parasitic heating .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4](b ) shows how the cbt electron temperature diverges from the refrigerator temperature below @xmath47 . here </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath23 is found by measuring @xmath54 close to @xmath43 and so joule heating can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the functional form of @xmath23 vs @xmath74 should have the same temperature dependence as the dominant thermalisation mechanism , i.e. @xmath107 for electron - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> however , other power laws have been observed@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we find that the best fit of @xmath108 gives @xmath94 and a saturated @xmath23 of @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted exponent @xmath110 can not be confirmed by measurements of the conductance dip because the overheating is still relatively weak even at the lowest temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a thermal model with a @xmath111 thermalisation term fits the data equally well as a model using @xmath107 . in order to understand the thermalisation mechanism in more detail </S>",
    "<S> , this sensor would need to be cooled closer to @xmath112 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , cbts of the structure described here have been shown to operate as reliable primary thermometers of electron temperature down to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the large thermalisation blocks incorporated in the device , and a relatively low level of parasitic heating , ensure that the electron subsystem in the sensor is well coupled to the phonon subsystem down to @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> an immersion cell was shown to improve thermal coupling between a cbt and a dilution refrigerator . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed the onset of overheating to be observed below @xmath1 , and while the presence of overheating could be seen , the effect was sufficiently weak that the sensor will need to be cooled further to fully characterise the thermalisation mechanisms . </S>"
