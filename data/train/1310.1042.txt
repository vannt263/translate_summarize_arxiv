    "a cycle is one of the most basic structures in a graph , so it comes as no surprise that cycles have been analysed from the very beginnings of graph theory .",
    "this article focuses on longest cycles in cubic graphs .",
    "the _ circumference _ @xmath0 of a graph @xmath1 is the length of a longest cycle .",
    "the _ circumference ratio _ is the ratio of circumference to order .",
    "the _ circumference deficit _ is the difference between order and circumference .",
    "a lot of attention was given to hamiltonian graphs , that is , graphs with zero circumference deficit .",
    "compared to the vast tomes written on hamiltonicity , non - hamiltonian graphs appear rather neglected despite there is plenty of investigation to be done .",
    "the problem of determining the circumference of a given graph is np - hard and even approximation is a very tough problem @xcite , so no simple characterisations are expected .",
    "it transpired in many areas that the most interesting cubic graphs are those with chromatic index four .",
    "such graphs are called _ snarks _ ; we will additionally require snarks to have girth at least five and cyclic edge - connectivity at least four .",
    "we will encounter them in section  [ snarks ] where we prove the existence of a snark of girth at least @xmath10 and circumference deficit at least @xmath10 for every integer @xmath10 .",
    "section  [ ratio ] is devoted to upper bounds on circumference ratio ; we provide linear bounds for certain classes of cyclically @xmath2- , @xmath3- , and @xmath4-edge - connected cubic graphs .",
    "these bounds serve as the best presently known upper bounds on general lower bounds on circumference ratio .",
    "each subcubic graph can be transformed into a @xmath11-edge - colourable graph by removing sufficiently many edges .",
    "the least number of edges that need to be removed is the _ resistance _ of the graph .",
    "there are snarks with arbitrarily large resistance ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "most of our constructions are based on building blocks with large resistance ; the usefulness of such blocks is demonstrated in lemma  [ lemma1 ] which plays the key role in our proofs .",
    "circumference ratio of cubic graphs strongly depends on connectivity . since each vertex of a cubic graph is separated by three edges from the rest of the graph , the classical notions of vertex - connectivity and edge - connectivity are of limited use . a refined measure of connectivity , much more appropriate for our purpose , is provided by cyclic edge - connectivity .",
    "a graph is _ cyclically @xmath12-edge - connected _ if at least @xmath12 edges must be removed to disconnect it into components among which there are at least two containing a cycle . for cubic graphs ,",
    "the notion of cyclic @xmath12-edge - connectivity coincides with @xmath12-vertex - connectivity and @xmath12-edge - connectivity for @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "if we allow bridges in our graphs , there are infinitely many trivial cubic graphs with circumference @xmath3 .",
    "what is more interesting , bondy and entringer @xcite proved that every @xmath14-edge - connected cubic graph @xmath1 contains a cycle of length at least @xmath15 .",
    "this bound is essentially best possible , as shown by lang and walther @xcite .",
    "bondy and simonovits @xcite conjectured the existence of a constant @xmath16 such that every @xmath11-connected cubic graph @xmath1 has circumference at least @xmath17 and showed that @xmath18 .",
    "the conjecture was verified by jackson @xcite for @xmath19 ; the constant @xmath16 has recently been improved to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "bondy also conjectured the following .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath21 such that every cyclically @xmath2-edge - connected cubic graph @xmath1 has circumference at least @xmath22 .",
    "[ conj : bondy ]    the dominating cycle conjecture @xcite implies that @xmath23 since a dominating cycle in a cubic graph @xmath1 has length at least @xmath24 . in addition , thomassen @xcite conjectured that there exists an integer @xmath12 such that every cyclically @xmath12-edge - connected cubic graph is hamiltonian .",
    "this would mean @xmath25 for sufficiently connected cubic graphs .",
    "we summarize the currently known results together with our contributions in table  [ tabulka ] .",
    "the column lb displays a lower bound which holds for all graphs ; the column ub shows an upper bound on circumference for a certain infinite class of graphs with required cyclic edge - connectivity .",
    "all the bounds are asymptotic ; each of them is expressed as a function of order @xmath26 .",
    ".summary of results on circumference ( our contribution are marked by @xmath27 ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the crucial observation used in our construction of graphs with large circumference deficit is captured in the following lemma .",
    "[ lemma1 ] let @xmath28 be a subgraph of a bridgeless cubic graph @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath28 has resistance @xmath12 , then any cycle of @xmath1 not contained in @xmath28 misses at least @xmath12 vertices of @xmath28 .    if a cycle @xmath29 of @xmath1 is not contained in @xmath28 , then its intersection with @xmath28 is a union of vertex - disjoint paths .",
    "take each of those paths in turn and alternately colour the edges along the path by colours @xmath30 and @xmath14 .",
    "colour all the remaining edges by @xmath11 .",
    "there are two types of vertices in @xmath28 : those that have their incident edges coloured by @xmath30 , @xmath14 , @xmath11 and those with all incident edges coloured by @xmath11 .",
    "we call the vertices of the latter type _ bad_. by removing all the bad vertices we obtain a @xmath11-edge - colourable graph from @xmath28 . however , @xmath28 has resistance @xmath12 , and thus there are at least @xmath12 bad vertices .",
    "obviously , no bad vertex belongs to @xmath29 , hence @xmath29 misses at least @xmath12 vertices of @xmath28 .",
    "in order to construct infinite classes of graphs with circumference ratio promised in table  [ tabulka ] , we employ cubic construction blocks described in @xcite .",
    "( we do not include construction details or proofs of their properties in this article ; an interested reader can find them in @xcite . )     with @xmath31 vertices and resistance @xmath14 . ]",
    "the cubic graph @xmath32 has order @xmath31 , resistance @xmath14 , and two pairs of dangling edges ( see figure  [ fig : n2 ] and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7 ) ) .",
    "we create a graph @xmath1 by arranging @xmath33 copies of @xmath32 along a circle and for each copy @xmath34 , we connect one pair of dangling edges of @xmath34 to a pair of dangling edges of the following copy and the other pair of dangling edges to a pair in the previous copy .",
    "( the exact way of how we do it does not matter because we only need to preserve cyclic @xmath2-edge - connectivity . ) according to lemma  [ lemma1 ] , a cycle of @xmath1 either belongs to one copy of @xmath32 or misses at least @xmath14 vertices in each of the @xmath35 copies of @xmath32 , hence @xmath1 has circumference deficit at least @xmath36 and circumference ratio at most @xmath37 .",
    "a different idea used in theorem  [ thm7/8 ] leads to a better upper bound for cyclically @xmath2-edge - connected graphs .",
    "the construction described in the previous paragraph can be repeated with the cyclically @xmath3-edge - connected building block @xmath38 with order @xmath39 and resistance @xmath30 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8 and figure 5 ) for a description of @xmath38 ; this block was also used by steffen under the name @xmath40 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.3 ) ) .",
    "the graph @xmath38 has seven dangling edges naturally split into two triples and one single dangling edge .",
    "we repeat the circular construction with @xmath35 copies of @xmath38 instead of @xmath32 ; the role of the pairs of dangling edges is now played by the triples .",
    "the single dangling edges are joined to a cycle of length @xmath35 ( one dangling edge to each vertex of the cycle ) .",
    "the resulting graph has circumference ratio at most @xmath41 and is cyclically @xmath3-edge - connected .",
    "a similar construction can also be used to construct cyclically @xmath4-edge - connected graphs ; however , the details are more complicated .",
    "section 9 of @xcite describes a cyclically @xmath4-edge - connected graph @xmath42 of order @xmath43 with resistance at least @xmath44 for each even positive integer @xmath44 , but there are no dangling edges in this graph , thus we can not use it directly : we first have to cut a few suitable edges to obtain a block which would allow a construction of cyclically @xmath4-edge - connected graphs .",
    "the graph @xmath42 is obtained by symmetrically applying superposition to a graph @xmath45 composed of @xmath44 circularly arranged isomorphic copies of the block @xmath46 ( that is , the petersen graph with one vertex removed ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath42 also contains @xmath44 isomorphic blocks @xmath47 arranged along a circle .",
    "each two consecutive blocks of @xmath42 are joined by three edges .",
    "we cut all the edges between @xmath48 and @xmath49 to form a cubic graph @xmath50 with two triples of dangling edges .",
    "the graph @xmath50 has order @xmath43 and resistance at least @xmath51 . (",
    "according to the definition of resistance , the removal of an edge can decrease resistance by at most @xmath30 .",
    "the resistance of @xmath50 is actually @xmath44 , but that would require a detailed proof ; we will use the obvious lower bound of @xmath51 here because it is sufficient for our purpose . )",
    "consequently , we can use @xmath50 in place of @xmath32 in the above - described construction ( with triples of dangling edges instead of pairs ) .",
    "the resulting cyclically @xmath4-edge - connected cubic graph @xmath1 has order @xmath52 and circumference deficit at least @xmath53 , thus its circumference ratio is at most @xmath54 . by taking a sufficiently large @xmath44 we can make this ratio to be arbitrarily close to @xmath55 .    for each integer @xmath35 , there exists a cyclically @xmath2-edge - connected cubic graph with order @xmath56 and circumference @xmath57 .",
    "[ thm7/8 ]    let @xmath58 and @xmath59 be two adjacent vertices of the petersen graph @xmath60 .",
    "we remove the path @xmath61 , but keep the dangling edges incident to exactly one of its endvertices ; the dangling edges incident to @xmath58 are _ input edges _ and the dangling edges incident to @xmath59 are _ output edges_. we say that a path _ passes through _ @xmath62",
    "if it starts with a vertex incident to an input edge and ends in a vertex incident to an output edge .",
    "we say that a cycle passes through @xmath62 if a portion of this cycle ( a path ) passes through @xmath62 .",
    "the resulting graph @xmath62 has two properties interesting to us .    first , if a path passes through @xmath62 , it can not pass through all the vertices of @xmath62 : otherwise we would be able to extend this path by @xmath58 and @xmath59 to a hamiltonian cycle of @xmath60 , but @xmath60 has no such cycle .",
    "second , if we take two disjoint paths passing through @xmath62 , there is at least one vertex of @xmath62 missed by both of these paths .",
    "otherwise , we can extend the first path by @xmath58 , extend the other path by @xmath59 , and then concatenate them together by adding two edges to form a hamiltonian cycle of @xmath60 which is a contradiction .",
    "let @xmath1 be the graph obtained from @xmath35 copies of @xmath62 arranged along a circle in such a way that the output edges of each copy are identified with the input edges of the following copy ( see figure  [ fig : chain ] ) .",
    "the graph @xmath1 is cyclically @xmath2-edge - connected and has order @xmath56 .     and",
    "a sketch of the graph @xmath1.,title=\"fig : \" ] 1.5 cm    let @xmath29 be a cycle in @xmath1 .",
    "note that @xmath29 passes through each copy of @xmath62 at most twice . according to the two properties of @xmath62 proved above ,",
    "no matter how many times @xmath29 passes through @xmath62 , at least one vertex of @xmath62 is missed . the only possibility for @xmath29 to contain all vertices of @xmath62",
    "is to enter by an input edge and then leave by the other input edge ( of course , it can also both enter and leave by output edges , which is essentially the same situation ) .",
    "consequently , the cycle @xmath29 misses at least one vertex in each of at least @xmath63 copies of @xmath62 , and thus the circumference of @xmath1 is at most @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath1 contains a cycle of length @xmath57 , the derived upper bound on its circumference is tight .",
    "we propose the following strengthening of conjecture  [ conj : bondy ] .",
    "every cyclically @xmath2-edge - connected cubic graph has circumference ratio at least @xmath65 .",
    "this section is motivated by the cycle double cover conjecture ( cdcc ) .",
    "huck @xcite showed that the smallest possible counterexample to cdcc has girth at least @xmath66 .",
    "brinkmann et al .",
    "@xcite proved that if a bridgeless cubic graph @xmath1 has a cycle of length at least @xmath67 , then @xmath1 has a cycle double cover .",
    "put together , smallest counterexamples to cdcc can only be found in the class of snarks with girth at least @xmath66 and with circumference deficit at least @xmath68 . since",
    "no such snark has been known before , the following problem is very relevant .",
    "let @xmath70 be a snark of girth at least @xmath10 ; the existence of such snarks has been proved by kochol @xcite .",
    "let @xmath71 and @xmath72 be two adjacent vertices of @xmath70 and let @xmath73 and @xmath74 , for @xmath75 , be the two edges incident to @xmath76 and not incident to @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the cubic graph obtained from @xmath70 by removing @xmath71 and @xmath72 while keeping the dangling edges @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "the well - known parity lemma assures that the edges @xmath79 and @xmath81 have the same colour in every @xmath11-edge - colouring of @xmath78 ( otherwise @xmath70 would be @xmath11-edge - colourable , but it is a snark ) .",
    "take two copies of @xmath78 and join them as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : h_1 ] ( the edge @xmath81 of the first copy is identified with the edge @xmath81 of the second copy and the edges @xmath79 of both copies are attached to an additional vertex @xmath59 ) .",
    "if @xmath28 was @xmath11-edge - colourable , then the colour of @xmath79 of the first copy of @xmath78 would be the same as the colour of @xmath81 and , in turn , the same as the colour of @xmath79 of the second copy , leading to a contradiction at @xmath59 .",
    "hence , @xmath28 is not colourable and has resistance at least @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , there is no cycle of length less than @xmath10 in @xmath28 , and any path with endvertices incident to dangling edges of @xmath28 passes through at least @xmath83 vertices of @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a cubic graph obtained from @xmath10 copies of @xmath28 arranged along a circuit in such a way that two dangling edges of a copy of @xmath28 are attached to the previous copy and two of them are attached to the next .",
    "the remaining @xmath10 edges can be joined to a cycle of length @xmath10 in an arbitrary way preserving maximum degree @xmath11 .",
    "the graph @xmath1 clearly has girth at least @xmath10 , is cyclically @xmath2-edge - connected and is not @xmath11-edge - colourable .",
    "any cycle of @xmath1 not contained in @xmath28 misses at least one vertex in each copy of @xmath28 thanks to lemma  [ lemma1 ] , and thus @xmath1 has circumference deficit at least @xmath10 ."
