    "interactions can also change the topologically trivial band structures into non - trivial ones at mean - field level by developing bulk order parameters raghu2008,sun2009,zhang_ran2009 , wen2010 . due to the difficulty of analytic studies on strong correlation physics , exact results from numeric simulations are desirable .",

    "[ eq : density ] . clearly in eq .",
    "[ eq : km ] , the nn - hopping is real and the nnn - hopping is purely imaginary , thus its band structure is invariant at @xmath14 .",
    "eq : hubbard is obviously invariant .",
    "the particle - hole symmetry also implies that @xmath14 corresponds to half - filling .",
    "an important conclusion based on the particle - hole symmetry is that both charge and spin currents vanish on all the bonds for the kmh model of eq .",
    "[ eq : km ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : hubbard ] at @xmath14 .",
    "this result applies to arbitrary boundary conditions with broken bonds but with the homogeneous on - site potential which maintains the particle - hole symmetry on each site .",

    "the current operators of each spin component along the nn and nnn bonds are defined as @xmath19 respectively , where no summation over spin - index is assumed . both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are odd under the particle - hole transformation ,",
    "thus they vanish even with the open - boundary condition . by the same reasoning",
    ", the charge current also vanishes in the haldane - hubbard model with the purely imaginary nnn - hoppings and the particle - hole symmetric charge interactions of @xmath22    this result shows that edge charge and spin currents are not good criteria for quantum anomalous hall and topological insulators . in order to have a better understanding on this counter - intuitive result , we have considered the simplest non - interacting haldane model with the purely imaginary nnn hoppings by diagonalization .",
    "there are indeed gapless one - dimensional single particle chiral edge modes clearly seen from the spectra as commonly presented in literatures .",
    "clearly this branch of edge mode contributes to edge currents .",
    "however , we find that the continuous bulk spectra also contribute to edge currents .",
    "perfect cancellation occurs which results in zero current on each bond , including each edge bond , although we know for sure that the band structure is topologically non - trivial . for interacting models , there are no well - defined single particle states .",
    "we can not separate the edge and bulk contributions anymore .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that current correlation functions should exhibit difference between topological insulators and trivial insulators .",
    "another conclusion inferred from the particle - hole symmetry is that the average particle density for each spin component on each site is strictly @xmath23 even when the translational symmetry is broken .",
    "for example , it applies to any disordered pattern of the hopping integrals , as long as the nn hoppings are real and the nnn hoppings are purely imaginary .",
    "edge currents do appear if the particle - hole symmetry is broken .",
    "for example , for the non - interacting haldane model with generally complex - valued nnn hoppings , edge currents appear along open boundaries .",
    "so far we only consider the sharp edges of broken bonds but with homogeneous on - site potential . for edges with the confining single particle potential ,",
    "the particle - hole symmetry is broken which also results in edge currents .",
    "in particular , for a weak linear external potential , the linear response should still give rise to quantized hall conductance in the insulating region .      the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice , which corresponding to the case of @xmath6 of eq .",
