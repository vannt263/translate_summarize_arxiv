    "the spectral dimension @xmath0 of quantum geometries has been a rather hot topic in recent quantum gravity research .",
    "@xmath0 is one of the indicators of topological and geometric properties of quantum spacetime as described by different approaches , as well as a way to check that an effective semi - classical spacetime is obtained in appropriate sectors of the theory .",
    "one of the main goals of any such analysis is to prove that , among all the states and histories that appear in the theory ( most of which far from describing any smooth spacetime geometry ) , configurations which do so are either dominant or the approximate result of averaging over the others .",
    "a further goal is to study whether the effective dimension of spacetime remains the same at different scales or if it is subject to a dynamical reduction in the ultraviolet regime @xcite .    in dynamical triangulations",
    "@xcite , the spectral dimension has been important as one of the few observables available to classify phases of spacetime ensembles . in particular , in _ causal dynamical triangulations _ ( cdt ) in four dimensions it was found that , while very close to the spacetime topological dimension @xmath1 at large scales , at least in the geometric phase , it takes smaller values at short distances , approaching the value @xmath2 in the ultraviolet limit @xcite .",
    "similar results are obtained in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "two is , of course , an interesting value for the effective dimension in the ultraviolet , because gravity is perturbatively renormalizable in two dimensions . in fact , also in the asymptotic safety scenario @xcite one can find a reduction of the spectral dimension from the topological dimension @xmath3 to half of it under the renormalization group flow using analytical methods @xcite .",
    "other formalisms manifest similar behaviour .",
    "lifshitz gravity has a built - in dynamical dimensional reduction , due to the defining anisotropic scaling @xcite .",
    "modified dispersion relations in non - commutative spacetimes @xcite , super - renormalizable non - local gravity @xcite , black - hole effective physics @xcite and other scenarios ( including string theory @xcite ) give rise to a dimensional flow as well .",
    "apart from the intrinsic interest in this effect , its occurrence in approaches to quantum gravity which are otherwise hard to compare has raised hope that the spectral dimension might help to relate such approaches to one another , or at least to confront their results @xcite .",
    "although the spectral dimension is a rather coarse tool in comparison with more refined geometric indicators @xcite , its determination in full - fledged quantum geometries is still a technically challenging problem .",
    "all the above considerations gave good reasons to investigate the spectral dimension also in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite .",
    "using the spectrum of the area operator in lqg to guess an effective dispersion relation for propagating particles , some evidence was found for a dimensional flow of kinematical lqg states @xcite and their spacetime spin - foam dynamics @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we go beyond the arguments used in previous analyses and investigate the spectral dimension of lqg states in detail , at least at the level of kinematical states .",
    "in particular , we will study the spectral dimension for states defined on large graphs or complexes .",
    "lqg differs from all the above - mentioned approaches in that the degrees of freedom of the theory are discrete geometric data , i.e. , a combination of holonomies , fluxes or lorentz group representations @xcite associated with combinatorial structures such as graphs and cellular complexes .",
    "this combination poses new challenges .",
    "so far , the spectral dimension has been investigated in more or less traditional smooth settings , in terms of either modified differential structures ( multi - scale spacetimes @xcite ) or modified dispersion relations on a smooth geometric manifold ( asymptotic safety , where anomalous scaling is a general feature at the non - gaussian fixed point ; non - commutative spacetimes , where modified dispersion relations are a consequence of a deformed poincar symmetry ; hoava  lifshitz gravity , where the laplacian is multi - scale by construction ; and so on ) . also previous work on the lqg case @xcite has been limited to an approximation in which the scaling of the laplacian is first extracted from the area spectrum and then effectively treated as continuous . in other approaches , the setting is purely combinatorial : such is the case of cdt ( the dynamical degrees of freedom are equilateral triangulations ) or graph models @xcite .",
    "therefore , the first important step is a definition of the spectral dimension on the type of discrete geometries lqg is built on .",
    "this preliminary work has already been carried out in @xcite , where we have generalized discrete exterior calculus @xcite to be applicable to such discrete geometries , and we have given explicit expressions for the laplacian ( the basic geometric operator the spectral dimension depends on ) in terms of the variables relevant for lqg .    unless stated otherwise , from now on by ` spectral dimension ' we always mean the one _ of spatial ( not spacetime ) geometries_. also , by _ quantum spectral dimension _ of a quantum state of geometry we indicate the spatial spectral dimension as derived from the expectation value of the heat kernel trace on the quantum geometry . in the usual interpretation",
    ", this heat kernel is the solution of the diffusion equation for a test pointwise particle propagating on the quantum geometry , where the differential variable is an abstract ` diffusion time ' @xmath4 .",
    "one can employ a different and perhaps more convincing interpretation @xcite , where the diffusion equation is a running equation with respect to the resolution @xmath5 at which geometry is probed .",
    "we will explain why , in the case of discrete quantum gravity , for a well - defined notion of quantum spectral dimension the quantum expectation value has to be taken at the level of the heat kernel , and not directly of the laplacian .",
    "the combination of combinatorial discreteness and additional ( pre-)geometric data obviously must result in an interplay of their respective effects . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the latter have never been classified in the literature .",
    "a major aim of this paper is to understand this interplay in the case of kinematical lqg states .",
    "we first study systematically the topological and geometric effects in the spectral dimension of smooth spheres and tori as well as the discreteness effects of combinatorial complexes with geometric realizations as ( hyper-)cubulations or triangulations of these .",
    "this groundwork having been done , we can then compare the spectral dimension of quantum states with that of the discrete geometries they are semi - classical approximations or superpositions of . as a general tendency",
    ", we find that the effect of the underlying combinatorics dominates and that a relatively large size of the base complexes is needed for the spectral dimension to behave as a spatial dimension at all .",
    "to construct explicit lqg states on large complexes and calculate the corresponding expectation values of global observables is a major and seldom accepted challenge . in the case of the spectral dimension , however , this becomes inevitable . as a line of attack",
    ", we set up a way to numerically construct large abstract simplicial complexes and define geometries thereon .",
    "we follow @xcite to derive their combinatorial properties needed for studying the action of the laplacian operator .    while the preparatory work on the classical geometries is done in arbitrary dimensions , we restrict the quantum analysis to kinematical states of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional euclidean lqg .",
    "there are two reasons for this restriction .",
    "the first is merely technical .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom for given assignments of algebraic data grows with the combinatorics of the complex as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are , respectively , the topological dimension and the size of the combinatorial complex .",
    "the laplacian operator defined thereon is an @xmath9 matrix , which makes the computational effort more severe as @xmath7 increases .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath8 one can calculate much larger @xmath10 discrete geometries than in @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "a sufficient combinatorial size turns out to be crucial for the physical interpretation of the spectral dimension as a notion of positive - definite dimension somewhere close to @xmath7 .",
    "this limitation could be easily overcome by using a more powerful computational environment for numerical analysis .",
    "the second reason lies in the structure of quantum gravity itself . in 2 + 1 dimensions ,",
    "the spin - network basis of lqg simultaneously diagonalizes all edge - length operators , permitting a straightforward definition of the laplacian and a direct identification of deviations of the quantum spectral dimension from its classical counterpart as quantum corrections . in 3 + 1 dimensions",
    ", one would have to deal further with effects due to the non - commutativity of the full set of geometric operators needed to define the laplacian , as well as with the role of non - geometric configurations which we know are present in the standard @xmath12-based hilbert space of the theory .",
    "its construction thus becomes much more involved and it is much harder to be implemented efficiently for numerical calculations .",
    "while these challenges do not pose any obstacle in principle , we prefer to concentrate here on the more straightforward 2 + 1 case .",
    "once the general influence of quantum geometric effects ( discreteness , quantum fluctuations , and so on ) on the spectral dimension is understood , one can move on to study the additional complications that are present in the four - dimensional case .",
    "this paper is quite explorative in nature .",
    "there are no constraints on the kind of combinatorial manifolds lqg states could be defined on .",
    "thus , the only guidance may come from classical geometries one might want to approximate semi - classically by coherent states . furthermore , there is no unique way to parametrize the ` quantum - ness ' of states .",
    "in fact , to search for genuine quantum effects of lqg states , it is not enough to pick one state and look only at the value of its spectral dimension at small scales , as is usually done when some kind of dimensional flow is expected .",
    "instead , we compute the spectral dimension for those states we consider as ` more quantum ' .",
    "these are coherent spin - network states peaked at smaller representation labels and with larger spread and , more generally , states highly randomized in the intrinsic geometry or superposed with respect to various geometric degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , in order to explore quantum effects of the combinatorial structure and to compare with cdt , we consider superpositions of these structures as well .      in section [ sec : dsriem ] , the spectral dimension is introduced by the common definition on riemannian manifolds .",
    "we present then a definition on discrete geometries .",
    "this is the basis whereupon to define the quantum spectral dimension in general , and explicitly in the case of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional lqg , which we review .    in section [ sec : topo ] ,",
    "geometric and topological features are discussed , both analytically and numerically , in particular for the simple examples of spheres and tori . in section [ sec : dsdiscrete ] , we study the features of the spectral dimension on discrete structures , exemplified through various cases . these preliminary considerations are carried out also in higher dimensions .",
    "this part of the paper classifies phenomena which can appear in all contexts where a discrete spacetime structure is employed , both in analytic and numerical applications ; hence , it may be of interest also for the general reader not specialized in quantum gravity .    in section [ sec : dskinematics ] ,",
    "the expectation value of kinematical quantum space states in 2 + 1 lqg is analyzed . here",
    "the focus is on investigating the relevance , for the spectral dimension , of the geometric data additional to the geometry coming from purely combinatorial structures .",
    "the spectral dimension of semi - classical states is compared with the classical one to identify quantum corrections , which turn out to be rather small .",
    "furthermore , superpositions of coherent states peaked at different spins will be discussed ; the spectral dimension of these configurations will be found via a certain averaging procedure .",
    "complementary to these superpositions in geometry , in section [ sec : sumdis ] we analyze the spectral dimension of superpositions of states on two classes of torus triangulations .",
    "it turns out that the quantum spectral dimension in lqg is more sensitive to the underlying graph structure of states than to the associated geometric data .",
    "in this section , we start by introducing the concept of spectral dimension in the usual context of riemannian manifolds .",
    "we show how this definition can be transferred to discrete pseudo - manifolds , i.e. , abstract finite simplicial complexes with manifold properties .",
    "it is straightforward then to define the quantum spectral dimension in terms of expectation values on quantum states . for kinematical states of lqg in 2 + 1 dimensions",
    ", we argue that this expression is well defined under rather mild conditions .",
    "the definition of the spectral dimension is related to the scaling of the propagator of a massless test particle field ( or , equivalently , to a diffusion process on the spatial manifold ) .",
    "@xmath0 is defined via the heat kernel @xmath13 , which describes the diffusion of the particle in fictitious ` time ' @xmath4 from point @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the solution of the diffusion equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the laplacian with respect to the underlying space .",
    "actually , @xmath4 has dimension of a squared length since we set the diffusion parameter in front of the laplacian to 1 . alternatively ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : heatkereq ] ) can be regarded as a running equation establishing how much we can localize the point particle , placed at some point @xmath14 , if we probe the geometry with resolution @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the length scale @xmath19 represents the minimal detectable separation between points .",
    "while in the diffusion interpretation @xmath16 is the probability to find the particle at point @xmath15 after diffusing for some time @xmath4 from point @xmath14 , in the ` resolution ' interpretation @xmath16 is the probability to see the particle in a neighborhood of point @xmath15 of size @xmath20 if the geometry is probed with resolution @xmath5 . for infinite resolution ( @xmath21 ) and a delta initial condition , the particle is found where it was actually placed ( at @xmath14 ) , while the smaller the resolution ( i.e. , larger diffusion time ) the wider the region where it can be seen .",
    "there is no practical difference between the two interpretations but the latter is more suitable in diffeomorphism - invariant theories where the notion of diffusion time makes no sense ( while a lorentz - invariant scale does ) .    a formal solution to the problem is provided by @xmath22 where the initial condition is incorporated as the definition of the inner product @xmath23 of particle states .",
    "usually , the particle is taken to be concentrated at @xmath21 in the point @xmath14 , but it could start with other distributions .    in the usual context of a riemannian @xmath7-manifold @xmath24 , the beltrami  laplace operator is ( on 0-forms the connection laplacian and hodge laplacian agree ) @xmath25 with the initial condition @xmath26 the heat kernel is @xmath27 with @xmath28 the geodesic distance .",
    "on @xmath24 there is a well - defined ( the so called seeley ",
    "dewitt ) expansion of the heat kernel around the solution on a flat manifold @xmath29 with the metric distance being the euclidean norm @xmath30 , @xmath31 where the @xmath32 are computable in terms of geometric invariants @xcite .",
    "the spectral dimension probed by the particle can now be defined as the scaling of the trace of the heat kernel @xmath33 called return probability .",
    "while in the flat case @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , the general heat - kernel expansion yields a power series @xmath36 where @xmath37 and the coefficients @xmath38 consist of geometric invariants averaged over the manifold .",
    "the spectral dimension @xmath0 can be implicitly defined as the scaling of the heat trace in some limit of @xmath4 , @xmath39 such that @xmath40 for the flat case , while in general there are corrections related to global properties described by the geometric invariants @xmath41 .",
    "the implicit definition ( [ eq : dsimplicit ] ) can be generalized as @xmath42 by definition ( via heat trace @xmath43 , heat kernel @xmath16 and laplace operator @xmath18 ) the spectral dimension is a functional of the geometry @xmath44 $ ] on the given manifold @xmath45 .    in most of the literature on quantum gravity , equation ( [ eq : heatkereq ] )",
    "is taken on euclideanized spacetime but , as stressed in the introduction , we will strictly confine our analysis to _ spatial _ geometries . consequently , @xmath11 is the case that fits large scale , semiclassical observations .      from a quantum gravity perspective",
    ", the spectral dimension is particularly interesting because it can be rather easily extended to discrete geometries as well .",
    "discrete geometries constitute the degrees of freedom of lqg , spin foams and group field theory ( and of cdt in the purely combinatorial case , that is when the graph distance is chosen to specify completely the geometry ) .",
    "let us briefly recapitulate the framework of discrete calculus needed for the definition of the spectral dimension on discrete geometries provided in @xcite .",
    "in the most general context we deal with combinatorial complexes , in particular abstract finite simplicial @xmath7-pseudo - manifolds @xmath46 , with additional ( pre-)geometric data , i.e. , volume variables associated with simplices or cells . if @xmath46 has a geometric realization @xmath47 on some metric space , it can be thought of as the triangulation of a smooth geometry @xmath24 . but this needs not be the case .    in this",
    "setting , there is a definition of the laplace operator in terms of discrete exterior calculus , giving a precise meaning to the formal expression ( [ eq : kformal ] ) . to this end , we take the diffusing scalar test particle field @xmath48 as a field living on the @xmath7-simplices @xmath49 , or equivalently on the vertices of the combinatorially dual complex . then , the action of the laplacian on @xmath48 evaluated at some simplex @xmath49 takes the form @xmath50 where the sum runs over neighboring simplices and @xmath51 , @xmath52@xmath53 and @xmath54 are , respectively , the @xmath7-volume of @xmath49 , the @xmath55-volume of the common face and a dual length through that face .    by definition , this laplacian has most of the properties of the continuum laplacian .",
    "that is , it obeys the null condition , it is self - adjoint ( which relates to the symmetrizability of its matrix ) and it is local , i.e. , the action on a given position depends only on neighboring positions . in @xcite",
    "we have also argued for the convergence to the continuum laplacian under refinement of triangulations .",
    "nevertheless , there are properties which are further dependent on the definition of the volumes .",
    "we have argued that a definition in terms of a barycentric dual interpretation of the volumes should be preferred to a circumcentric one in the field theoretic context because only the former preserves positivity of the laplacian .",
    "for this reason , we will adhere to this convention throughout this paper .",
    "if we further assume that the volumes associated with the finite simplicial complex @xmath56 are finite and non - degenerate , in particular non - vanishing , the matrix elements of the laplacian are finite and well defined . the laplacian is then diagonalized by its eigenfunctions @xmath57 corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath58 , @xmath59 and these form a complete orthonormal basis defining momentum space .",
    "using the transformation to momentum space the heat trace of @xmath48 turns our to be @xcite @xmath60 since @xmath18 is symmetrizable , for real geometric volume coefficients in equation ( [ eq : dislap ] ) the spectrum spec and thus the heat trace are real valued .    in the trivial case of constant volumes over the complex ,",
    "e.g. , equilateral triangulations , the laplacian is just proportional to the combinatorial graph laplacian of the dual 1-skeleton of the complex @xmath46 .      in a quantum theory of geometry ,",
    "the metric or other classically equivalent variables are promoted to operators .",
    "the spectral dimension as an observable is a functional of these operators and we are now interested in its expectation value for a given state @xmath61 of space geometry ( using the heat trace ( [ eq : heattraceunnormed ] ) ) .",
    "one possibility is to take the heat trace as the primary observable to be quantized .",
    "formally , @xmath62 suppose the quantum laplacian @xmath63 , operator on the hilbert space of geometry states , is diagonalizable with orthonormal eigenbasis @xmath64 ( later we will take the states @xmath64 to be the spin - network basis of the kinematical lqg hilbert space ) .",
    "then every state can be expanded in this basis , @xmath65 , and the heat trace simplifies : @xmath66 an explicit expression of the spectral dimension ( [ eq : dsquantum ] ) is thus @xmath67 in the following , we will drop the superscript @xmath61 in the spectral dimension .",
    "alternatively , one might consider the laplacian instead of the heat kernel as the fundamental observable for the spectral dimension .",
    "this would give a different result with a product instead of the sum over the eigenbasis .",
    "from @xmath68 there follows @xmath69 on states @xmath70 with discrete support , e.g. , on the simplicial complexes considered here , this formal expression makes sense only if all states live on the same discrete structure .",
    "otherwise , the product of @xmath71 and @xmath72 is not defined , since it would amount to a sum of matrices of different size in the exponent . in theories of quantum gravity with discrete geometries as degrees of freedom , such as lqg",
    ", the full hilbert space usually contains states ( including superpositions ) on various distinct combinatorial structures . for this reason ,",
    "the possibility of defining the quantum spectral dimension as derived from the expectation value of the laplacian has to be excluded .",
    "a similar issue arises when taking the expectation value at the level of the heat kernel @xmath16 , since it is a function of positions on the ( discrete ) manifold .",
    "it can only be avoided by tracing over the manifold .",
    "therefore , we will take the expression in terms of the expectation value of the heat trace , equation ( [ eq : dsquantum ] ) , as the proper definition of quantum spectral dimension .",
    "this is the same as used in cdt @xcite , while in the smooth approaches where this issue does not arise @xcite the expectation value is taken at the level of the laplacian .",
    "as a side remark , notice that using the ` normed ' heat trace @xmath73 instead of @xmath74 would lead to a classically equivalent definition of the spectral dimension ( [ eq : dsexplicit ] ) , as its scaling is independent of proportionality factors .",
    "this definition is very often used for effective continuous spacetimes in quantum gravity , as it gets rid of an infinite volume prefactor in @xmath43 . however , at the quantum level and in the case of superposition states , there is a notable difference . for the volume - normed heat trace ( [ eq : heattracenormed ] ) ,",
    "@xmath75 states are weighted by an additional inverse - volume factor @xmath76 . since for quantum geometries",
    "this factor might have singular behaviour ( for instance , on states of degenerate geometry where the volume operator is not densely defined and has 0 as an eigenvalue ) , we prefer equation ( [ eq : heattraceunnormed ] ) to define the quantum spectral dimension .",
    "lqg states are functions of spatial geometric variables ( holonomies , flux variables or representation labels ) smeared over graphs @xmath77 which we restrict to be dual 1-skeletons of a discrete pseudo - manifolds @xmath46 , to be able to use the discrete laplacian ( [ eq : dislap ] ) .",
    "furthermore , as anticipated and motivated in the introduction , we will restrict here to ( 2 + 1)-dimensional lqg .",
    "now , the elements of @xmath78 are functions of the holonomies on the links of the dual graph @xmath79 of a simplicial complex @xmath46 corresponding to a @xmath10 spatial slice by the dual graphs @xmath77 instead of the corresponding simplicial pseudo - manifolds is allowed because their relation is one - to - one .",
    "this can be easily seen since dual 1-skeletons of simplicial pseudo - manifolds are colorable and colorable graphs are dual to simplicial pseudo - manifolds @xcite . ] . since @xmath77 is 3-regular , i.e.",
    ", all nodes are 3-valent , the gauge - invariant spin - network basis @xmath80 is given by contraction of the link representations @xmath81 with the unique trivial intertwiners , i.e. , clebsch  gordan symbols .    in 2 + 1",
    "dimensions the spin - network basis diagonalizes the length operators with a spectrum given in terms of the @xmath12 casimir operator @xcite : @xmath82|s\\rangle\\,,\\ ] ] where the scale @xmath83 is set by the planck length and the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter and @xmath84 is a constant dependent on the quantization map chosen for the casimir operator @xcite . if @xmath85 , the clebsch  gordan conditions",
    "@xmath86 implicit in the intertwiners on vertices of @xmath77 yield triangle inequalities on the primal complex , @xmath87 this can be seen from the inequality @xmath88 only for @xmath89 there are degenerate spin configurations where the inequality on the lengths is not strict ( e.g. , @xmath90 ) . even in this case",
    "one could obtain the triangle inequalities by restricting to those states in @xmath91 corresponding to non - degenerate configurations .",
    "we do not expect this to be a significant restriction in the calculation of the quantum spectral dimension . in the following we take @xmath92 , although calculations of the spectral dimension with different values indicate that @xmath0 is not so much sensitive to such choice .",
    "in fact , we have tested the @xmath93 case with very similar results .",
    "now , an obvious choice is to take an explicit form of the discrete laplacian in terms of edge - length variables ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 63 ) ) ) . as an operator , it acts on a spin - network state @xmath80 as @xmath94 while the form of the primal volumes in the laplacian , i.e. , the triangle areas @xmath95 and the edge lengths themselves , is straightforward , there is in principle some freedom in choosing the form of the dual edge lengths as functions of primal lengths .",
    "we choose an expression related to a barycentric dual as argued for above and in @xcite .",
    "let us now check whether the formal expression for the heat - trace expectation value is well defined in this context , i.e. , if the heat trace is a self - adjoint operator .",
    "more precisely , the question is the following : is the heat trace operator @xmath96 self - adjoint on the kinematical hilbert space @xmath91 ?",
    "that is , for @xmath97 , @xmath98 with the above laplacian , the left - hand side is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the identity of graphs up to automorphisms ( taking the usual inner product of lqg , states defined on distinct graphs are orthogonal ) .",
    "this is equal to the right - hand side of ( [ usef ] ) if , and only if , the spectrum of @xmath74 is real : @xmath101^{*}\\delta_{\\gamma,\\gamma'}\\delta_{j , j'}\\,.\\ ] ] in general , since the entries of @xmath18 consist of lengths and areas , they are real on geometric states where triangle inequalities ( [ trianineq ] ) , or equivalently closure constraints ( which are geometricity conditions ) are satisfied .",
    "then , @xmath102 is real as well .",
    "hence @xmath103 is a good quantum observable on the kinematical states of 2 + 1 gravity with the operator ordering of @xmath104 chosen @xcite such that @xmath85 , which we are considering here .",
    "so far , we have given and discussed the definition of spectral dimension in the smooth , discrete and quantum cases , in particular for quantum states of geometry in 2 + 1 lqg , thereby setting the stage for its calculation .",
    "since the quantum properties of such observable depend on their interplay with classical topological and discreteness effects , in the next two sections we will first investigate these effects separately before addressing the quantum case .",
    "in this section , we calculate the spectral dimension of spheres and tori and discuss the role of topology and geometry in these examples . in preparation for the actual lqg calculations ( where these topologies are chosen ) , it is important to have these effects under control",
    ".    at large diffusion scales @xmath4 , the dominant effects in the behaviour of the heat trace and the spectral dimension are due to the topology of @xmath45 .",
    "qualitatively , a compact topology leads to a fall - off of @xmath105 to zero .",
    "the scale at which this happens is related to the geometry ( i.e. , the curvature radii ) . in the light of the heat trace interpretation in terms of random walks , this can be easily understood : the return probability approaches one after diffusion times @xmath4 larger than the circumferences ( closed geodesics ) .",
    "the resolution interpretation is also easy to spell out : as the resolution is lowered , one can not distinguish different points but , due to the limited compact geometry of the set , the particle does not spread over an infinite manifold and it roughly appears localized in the same region .    to clarify these topological and geometric features",
    ", we discuss the case of the circle @xmath106 and the generalization to the @xmath7-torus @xmath107 and the @xmath7-sphere @xmath108 . for @xmath107",
    ", we even find analytic solutions in closed form for the heat trace .    on a circle of radius @xmath109 ,",
    "the spectrum of the laplacian is @xmath110 , @xmath111 , yielding a heat trace @xmath112 in terms of the third theta function . while @xmath113 for @xmath114 , due to the periodicity there is a fall - off to zero for @xmath115 ( figure [ fig : dssmooth ] ) .",
    "rescaled to volume @xmath116 , for comparison divided by @xmath7 , for @xmath117 ( @xmath118 dashed line , @xmath119 solid , @xmath120 dot - dashed and @xmath121 dotted ) .",
    "the inverse square of the corresponding radii sets the scale of the topological effect . at the same time , it is a comparison with the case of @xmath107 with radii @xmath122 as these tori are equivalent to the case of @xmath106 .",
    "[ fig : dssmooth],width=283 ]    the geometry defined by the constant curvature radius @xmath109 governs only the scale at which the topological effect takes place . in that sense",
    ", the fall - off of the spectral dimension can be understood as due to the combination of geometry and topology .",
    "the torus @xmath123 with radii @xmath124 generalizes the case of the circle straightforwardly with spectrum @xmath125 , @xmath126 , such that @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the ( multi - dimensional ) riemann @xmath128-function @xcite .",
    "the spectral dimension of the case where all radii are equal turns out to be just @xmath7 times the spectral dimension of @xmath129 , since @xmath130^{d}.\\ ] ] on the other hand , with more geometric parameters given by the constant curvature radii @xmath124 , one can see that the geometry affects not only the scale at which the decay starts , but also accounts for various geometric regimes ( figure [ fig : dst2 ] ) .",
    "if the radii are ordered as @xmath131 , the spectral dimension is constantly the topological dimension for @xmath132 and zero for @xmath133 . in intermediate regimes",

    "it is natural that also the phase of the coherent state drops out of the expectation value .",

    "first , as they are semi - classical states peaking at classical geometries , it is interesting to check if their properties are reflected in the spectral dimension .",
    "second , if the quantum spectral dimension was comparable with the spectral dimension of the classical geometries peaked at , the difference should be understood as due to quantum corrections , which can be studied in a controlled manner in terms of the parameters of the coherent states .",
    "these parameters are the spins @xmath269 , the classical extrinsic geometries @xmath270 and the spread @xmath49 , as well as the graph @xmath77 they are defined on .",
    "the interpretation of the semi - classical limit in terms of these parameters is rather subtle here .",
    "as far as the spread is concerned , with respect to the whole coherent state @xmath271 there is a value where heisenberg inequalities are minimized , which would be the ` most semi - classical ' case . on the other hand ,",
    "since the spectral dimension on the spatial state is not dependent on the extrinsic curvature , obviously the deviation from the classical spectral dimension vanishes for @xmath272 , i.e. , states sharply peaked at the intrinsic curvature but totally random in the extrinsic one .",
    "nevertheless , these states are highly quantum .",
    "more interesting for our purpose are quantum effects of those states randomizing the intrinsic curvature , that is states with large spread @xmath49 .    furthermore , from the physical interpretation of the geometric spectra with corresponding eigenbasis in terms of the spin representations , the limit @xmath273 is often seen as another semi - classical limit .    finally , one should not forget the dependence of the states on the underlying graphs .",
    "at least with respect to the spectral dimension , classically we have already seen the important dependence on the combinatorial structure . at the level of kinematical states ,",
    "this dependence is still poorly understood in the literature .    in the following",
    ", we will consider the dual 1-skeletons of the previous regular torus triangulations as spin - network graphs @xmath77 .",

    ", we will consider states peaked at all equal @xmath276 for @xmath277 .",
    "a direct implementation of equation ( [ eq : qds ] ) is unfeasible .",

    "we have already shown that only for large classical triangulations ( e.g. , for @xmath213 of the order @xmath283 ; see figure [ fig : dst2triang ] ) a geometric regime is obtained .",

    "gordan conditions implicit in the intertwiners , the resulting effective space of spin configurations is highly non - trivial and , in general , not well understood .",

    "this justifies the approximation of the full sum , which in the case of superposition of graphs is considerably more challenging from a numerical point of view .",
    "as before , it is crucial whether the superposed triangulations are taken as purely combinatorial or as refinements of the same smooth geometry through rescaling the edge lengths ( figure [ fig : sumt2 ] ) . while in both cases the result is an averaging of the spectral dimension ( depending on the weights @xmath326 ) , in the first one this effect takes place at larger diffusion scales , in contrast with the small - diffusion - scale regime of the second .",

    "[ fig : sumt2],title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    the most interesting case here is the second ( rescaling ) .",
    "since all complexes summed over are triangulations of the same smooth geometry , it can be interpreted as a special case of a semi - classical state incorporating a ( kinematical ) continuum approximation ( which , obviously , can only be implemented up to some finite order in our explicit calculations ) .",
    "furthermore , the peak in the spectral dimension is a discreteness effect which does not appear for these states as a result of averaging .    for these reasons , it is interesting to calculate not only the superposition of a few rescaled triangulations but also of all regular triangulations of the type described in section [ sub : triangulations ] , of size ranging from @xmath328 up to some @xmath329 ( figure [ fig : sumt2pmax ] ) .",

    "[ fig : sumt2pmax],width=283 ]    the effect is a more extended plateau .",
    "thus , from these calculations one would expect the appearance of a plateau at the topological dimension for sums over more and larger triangulations , but without the discretization effect of a peak at the characteristic lattice scale .",
    "finally , the same can be done for the randomly subdivided triangulations .",
    "the effect of summing is , again , an averaging of the @xmath0 profiles .",
    "qualitatively , these are quite different from the regular triangulations .     triangulations ( dashed line , for comparison ; see figure [ fig : dst2subran ] ) , unrescaled ( left ) and rescaled ( right ) .",

    "the running of the spectral dimension in the profiles of the figures is , in fact , mainly due to discreteness artefacts ( @xmath333 at small @xmath4 ) and topological effects ( @xmath333 at large @xmath4 ) . on the other hand , superpositions of 1 - 3 pachner subdivisions",
    "have a @xmath0 plateau at a height smaller than the topological dimension ( figure [ fig : dst2randomsum ] ) . summarizing",
    ", the averaging effect stemming from superposition states is the only manifestation of additional geometric data in the profile of the spectral dimension , which would be otherwise reproduced by a classical triangulation .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the spatial spectral dimension of states of quantum geometry in the case of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional euclidean lqg . to this end , we have discussed the definition of the spectral dimension for combinatorial complexes equipped with the geometric variables defining the lqg configuration space .",
    "we have then showed that quantum states have a well - defined spectral dimension , identified with the scaling of the quantum expectation value of the heat trace .",
    "we also checked the quantum observable properties of these lqg geometries .",
    "we have presented for the first time a systematic classification of topological effects and discreteness artefacts in classical settings , pushing the analysis to analytic expressions whenever possible .",
    "after that , we studied coherent states in lqg , both as superpositions of geometries on the same complex and as superpositions of complexes , in particular triangulations of the same geometry .",
    "one of the main results of this work is the lack of any strong indication of a dimensional flow _ not _ due to topology or discreteness , as otherwise suggested in @xcite .    to clarify the source of this discrepancy ,",
    "let us discuss the differences between our work and @xcite more in detail .",
    "the basic idea in @xcite is to consider the scaling of the ( quantum ) laplacian with a length scale @xmath334 . since the laplacian scales as the inverse metric , and the metric roughly scales as an area",
    ", one could relate the scaling of the spectrum of the area operator in lqg to the scaling of the quantum laplacian . with the further identification , on one hand , of the length scale with the spin representation label @xmath226 as @xmath335 , and from dimensional reasonings in momentum space on the other hand , one ends up with an effective dispersion relation which is eventually used to derive the spectral dimension , as in the smooth approaches mentioned in the introduction .",
    "our starting point , in contrast , is to consider the full structure of the laplacian as directly acting on states of quantum geometry .",
    "the proper discrete laplacian ( [ eq : dislap ] ) indeed turns out to have a much richer structure than in the inverse - area heuristic argument .",
    "it is not obvious whether there could be any regime of approximation where the dimensional reasoning about the inverse area would apply .",
    "the laplacian takes necessarily the form of a matrix with non - zero entries for incident , neighboring nodes .",
    "therefore , it is further required to take the full underlying combinatorial structure into account , which is neglected in the approximations of @xcite .",
    "also , the validity of an approximation based on a single simplex is hard to understand from our perspective , as we have found that it is crucial to consider large enough complexes in order to reproduce the topological dimension at large scales ( small probing resolution ) .",
    "as we have seen , calculations on triangulations with few simplexes , such as the dipole , do not show any geometric regime between the ones in which discreteness and topology effects dominate , thus forbidding any interpretation of the spectral dimension as a spatial dimension .",
    "nevertheless , one might try to understand the approximations of @xcite in terms of regular lattices such as the ones used here with the regular triangulations .",
    "however , in contrast with the non - trivial dispersion relation derived from the area spectrum there , in our setting the effect of the discrete ( length ) spectrum seems to be washed away in a twofold way .",
    "first , because of the more involved manner in which the spectra are entering the expression of the laplacian and , second , because of the tracing over the dual nodes of large complexes .",
    "these two differences seem to be the main reason for the distinct results . due to the complexity of the problem",
    ", we have been unable to obtain the explicit dependence on such geometric data in the spin representation ( pure or coherently peaked at ) in a closed , analytic form .",
    "yet , this can still be analyzed when comparing states labelled with different spins .",
    "for the latter , our results clearly show only a minimal dependence ( figure [ fig : coherjs ] ) .",
    "notwithstanding , it has to be stressed that the calculations we have presented are only a first step , so our results can only be seen as a hopefully interesting indication of how actual lqg geometries behave .",
    "first , we have analyzed the spectral dimension only for _ kinematical _ states and in 2 + 1 euclidean lqg . in @xcite ,",
    "the argument was for kinematical states in 3 + 1 dimensions , although the result was interpreted as the spectral dimension of the full ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime and the effective dispersion relation was inserted in a heat trace over four - dimensional momentum space .",
    "furthermore , the argument was extended to physical states on certain one - simplex spin foams in the boundary formalism , in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite as well as in 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "the spectrum yielding the effective dispersion relation was taken to be the same in both dimensions there , but for the full laplacian considered in the present paper the step to 3 + 1 dimensions gives rise to essential differences , as already explained in the introduction .",
    "it is also clear that , eventually , the quantum spectral dimension should be considered on physical states , i.e. , the quantum dynamics needs to be taken into account for the results to have a solid physical significance .",
    "let us briefly discuss how these issues could be addressed .",
    "the most significant differences for gravity in 3 + 1 dimensions versus 2 + 1 dimensions lie in the dynamics . in this respect",
    ", one would not necessarily expect crucial qualitative discrepancies at the level of kinematical states in the quantum theory .",
    "however , in lqg the polyhedral interpretation in terms of the spectra of geometric observables is different in that the length spectra in 2 + 1 dimensions already provide a classical geometric interpretation as regge geometries , while in 3 + 1 dimensions the corresponding geometric variables are not sufficient .",
    "more variables such as dihedral angles would be needed , but their corresponding quantum operators do not commute .    in principle , these uncertainties do not pose any obstacle to define the laplacian @xcite and analyze the quantum spectral dimension .",
    "such features could be effectively captured using the flux representation of states and operators @xcite or , alternatively , the spinor representation @xcite . beside the implicit operator",
    "ordering ambiguities , the major challenge in pursuing this step is just technical .",
    "the explicit form of the laplacian becomes very complicated and clever ideas and approximations would be needed to cast the expectation value of the corresponding heat trace into a form feasible for actual computations .",
    "this is going to be an interesting challenge , as the non - commutativity in 3 + 1 dimension might give rise to unexpected features in the quantum spectral dimension .",
    "from the point of view of a complete theory of quantum gravity , the challenge to include the full dynamics is more important .",
    "this is indeed the starting point for studying the spectral dimension of spacetime , which is the actual quantity mainly studied in the quantum gravity literature so far .",
    "this observable could be defined in a covariant , path - integral - like formalism .",
    "then , the expectation value of the heat trace would amount to the insertion of the heat trace function in appropriate variables into a sum over spacetime histories .",
    "independently of the precise model of lqg dynamics chosen ( i.e. , the exact spin - foam or , equivalently , group field theory model ) , new issues arise .",
    "a first challenge is the concept of spacetime heat trace as a path - integral observable .",
    "the latter is not simply a polynomial in the configuration variables .",
    "this raises several computational difficulties : the insertion of the heat trace in the path integral can not be easily split into integrals of monomials of local variables . as a result",
    ", it seems quite hard , if not impossible , to solve the path integral with such heat - trace insertion .",
    "one should then find some viable approximation , for example one in which earlier results @xcite on ` ultralocal ' observables ( i.e. , observables depending only on the moduli of the discrete @xmath285-field values ) in the ponzano ",
    "regge model can be used to evaluate the heat - trace expectation value .",
    "even if a method for solving the path integral was at hand , a further issue is raised by degenerate configurations in the state sum .",
    "already in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional theory , the spin - foam sum generically contains degenerate geometries , in contrast with its kinematical states as shown in section [ sec : deflqg ] .",
    "we have done preliminary calculations on small complexes showing this feature @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the spacetime heat - trace insertion has a complex part .",
    "this is not , in itself , a sign of any inconsistency .",
    "nevertheless , it raises an interesting question about the physical relevance and interpretation of a complex spectral dimension , and it may represent an intriguing line of investigation in the analysis of the spin - foam quantum dynamics .    finally , a general issue with any explicit spin - foam evaluation is divergences .",
    "this is crucial for a global object such as the spectral dimension , since common regularization techniques may not be appropriate .",
    "for instance , gauge - fixing geometric data along a maximal tree of the dual complex @xcite are problematic because the heat trace might trivialize on the corresponding configurations . considering coherent states on the boundary suppressing larger spin configurations ( the cause of divergences ) in the bulk works only for smaller complexes .",
    "but , as we have discussed , larger complexes are needed in order to obtain a meaningful spectral dimension . one way to circumvent this problem would be spin - foam models with quantum groups @xcite .",
    "an actual solution , however , would consist in the proper renormalization of spin foams in terms of their group field theory ( second - quantized ) description @xcite .",

    "<S> the spectral dimension is an indicator of geometry and topology of spacetime and a tool to compare the description of quantum geometry in various approaches to quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible because it can be defined not only on smooth geometries but also on discrete ( e.g. , simplicial ) ones . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the spectral dimension of quantum states of spatial geometry defined on combinatorial complexes endowed with additional algebraic data : the kinematical quantum states of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) . </S>",
    "<S> preliminarily , the effects of topology and discreteness of classical discrete geometries are studied in a systematic manner . </S>",
    "<S> we look for states reproducing the spectral dimension of a classical space in the appropriate regime . </S>",
    "<S> we also test the hypothesis that in lqg , as in other approaches , there is a scale dependence of the spectral dimension , which runs from the topological dimension at large scales to a smaller one at short distances . while our results do not give any strong support to this hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> , we can however pinpoint when the topological dimension is reproduced by lqg quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> overall , by exploring the interplay of combinatorial , topological and geometrical effects , and by considering various kinds of quantum states such as coherent states and their superpositions , we find that the spectral dimension of discrete quantum geometries is more sensitive to the underlying combinatorial structures than to the details of the additional data associated with them </S>",
