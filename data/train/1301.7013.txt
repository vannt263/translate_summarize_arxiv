    "@xmath34 is called the total wave field and @xmath39 is called scattered wave field , which is the perturbation of the incident plane wave caused by the presence of the inhomogeneity @xmath32 in the whole space .",
    "indeed , it is easily seen that if there is no presence of the inhomogeneity , @xmath40 will be vanishing . for the particular case with @xmath41 , can also be used to describe the transverse - electric ( te ) polarized electromagnetic ( em ) wave propagation with the presence of an infinitely long cylindrical em inhomogeneity @xmath32 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this case ,",

    "we refer to @xcite for related physical background . in the rest of the paper , in order to ease the exposition , we stick to the terminologies with the acoustic scattering .",
    "we recall that by a weak solution to we mean that @xmath47 and that it satisfies @xmath48 the limit in has to hold uniformly for every direction @xmath49 and is also known as the _ sommerfeld radiation condition _ which characterizes the radiating nature of the scattered wave field @xmath40 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . there exists a unique weak solution @xmath50 to , and we refer to appendix in @xcite for a convenient proof .",
    "we remark that , if the coefficients are regular enough , corresponds to the following classical transmission problem @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the outward unit normal vector to @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath34 admits the following asymptotic development as @xmath54 @xmath55 in , @xmath56 with @xmath57 is known as the _ far - field pattern _ or the _ scattering amplitude _ , which depends on the impinging direction @xmath58 and wave number @xmath38 of the incident wave @xmath37 , observation direction @xmath59 , and obviously , also the underlying scattering object @xmath60 . in the following , we shall also write @xmath61 to indicate such dependences , noting that we consider @xmath38 to be fixed and we drop the dependence on @xmath38 .",
    "an important inverse scattering problem arising from practical applications is to recover the medium @xmath32 by knowing of @xmath62 .",
    "this inverse problem is of fundamental importance to many areas of science and technology , such as radar and sonar , geophysical exploration , non - destructive testing , and medical imaging to name just a few ; see @xcite and the references therein . in this work",
    ", we shall be mainly concerned with the invisibility cloaking for the inverse scattering problem , which could be generally introduced as follows .",
    "[ def : cloaking device ] let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be bounded lipschitz domains such that @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath9 represent , respectively , the cloaking region and the cloaked region .",
    "let @xmath65 and @xmath66 be two subsets of @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 is said to be an ( ideal / perfect ) _ invisibility cloaking device _ for the region @xmath9 if @xmath69 where the extended object @xmath70 with @xmath71 denoting a target medium . if @xmath72 , then it is called a _ full cloak _ , otherwise it is called a _ partial cloak _ with limited apertures @xmath65 of observation angles , and @xmath66 of impinging angles .    by definition  [ def : cloaking device ] , we have that the cloaking layer @xmath73 makes the target medium @xmath74 invisible to the exterior scattering measurements when the detecting waves come from the aperture @xmath66 and the observations are made in the aperture @xmath65 .",
    "one efficient way of constructing the invisibility cloak that has received significant attentions in recent years is the so - called transformation optics @xcite . by taking advantage of the push - forward properties of the material parameters",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 , the transformation optics approach via a blow - up transformation in constructing an ( ideal ) invisibility cloak can be simply described as follows .",
    "let @xmath75 be selected for constructing the cloaking device , and let @xmath76 be a point .",
    "@xmath77 lives in the so - called _ virtual space_. suppose that there exists a transformation @xmath78 which blows up the point @xmath79 to an open subset @xmath9 within @xmath8 .",
    "the homogeneous virtual space is then pushed - forward to form the cloaking layer @xmath80 . the cloaking layer together with a filling - in target medium @xmath81 forms the cloaking device , which lives in the so - called _",
    "physical space_. due to the transformation invariance of the helmholtz equation , it can be heuristically argued that the scattering amplitude in the physical space is the same as the scattering amplitude in the virtual space .",
    "since the scatterer in the virtual space is a singular point @xmath79 , whose scattering effect is negligible , this implies that the scattering amplitude in the physical space is also vanishing . here",
    ", we would like to emphasize that from a practical viewpoint , the target medium should be arbitrary or as general as possible , and this viewpoint shall be adopted throughout our current study .",
    "the blow - up - a - point construction yields singular cloaking materials , namely , the material parameters violate the regular conditions . the singular media present a great challenge for both theoretical analysis and practical fabrications ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to avoid the singular structure ,",
    "several regularized constructions have been developed . in @xcite ,",
    "a truncation of singularities has been introduced . in @xcite ,",
    "the ` blow - up - a - point ' transformation in @xcite has been regularized to become the ` blow - up - a - small - region ' transformation . in the current study",
    ", we shall adopt the latter one for the construction of our cloaking device .",
    "nevertheless , as pointed out in @xcite , the truncation - of - singularity construction and the blow - up - a - small - region construction are equivalent to each other . hence ,",
    "all the obtained results in this work equally hold for the truncation - of - singularity construction . instead of ideal / perfect invisibility , one would consider approximate / near invisibility for a regularized construction ; that is , one intends to make the corresponding scattering amplitude due to a regularized cloaking device as small as possible depending on an asymptotically small regularization parameter @xmath82 .",
    "this is the main subject of study for the present paper .",
    "due to its practical importance , the approximate cloaking has recently been extensively studied . in @xcite ,",
    "approximate cloaking schemes were developed for eit ( electric impedance tomography ) which might be regarded as optics at zero frequency . in @xcite ,",
    "various near - cloaking schemes were presented for scalar waves governed by the helmholtz equation .",
    "in all the aforementioned work , the constructions of the cloaking layer @xmath83 are based on blowing up a uniformly small neighborhood @xmath84 of a singular point @xmath79 ; namely , @xmath84 degenerates to the single point @xmath79 as @xmath4 . in order to stabilize and enhance the accuracy of approximation of the near - cloaks , various mechanisms have been developed in those literatures . particularly , we would like to note that , in @xcite , it is shown that the regularized approximate cloak is unstable due to the existence of cloak - busting inclusions , and the authors propose to incorporate a special lossy layer to stabilize the approximation .",
    "a different lossy layer was proposed and investigated in @xcite .",
    "the cloaking of impenetrable obstacles , which could be taken as lossy mediums with extreme material parameters , were considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also , we would like to point out that , in all those studies , the approximate full invisibility cloaks were obtained .",
    "in the present work , we develop a very general theory on the regularized approximate invisibility cloaking for the wave scattering governed by the helmholtz equation in any space dimensions @xmath0 via the approach of transformation optics .",
    "first , the non - singular cloaking medium is obtained by the push - forwarding construction through a transformation which blows up a subset @xmath1 in the virtual space , with @xmath1 degenerating to @xmath3 as @xmath4 . in our theory",
    ", @xmath3 could be very general .",
    "it could be any convex compact subset in @xmath5 , or any set whose boundary consists of lipschitz hypersurfaces , or a finite combination of those sets .",
    "for example , in @xmath85 , it could be a single point , or a line segment , or a bounded planar subset .",
    "this includes all the existing studies in the literature by blowing up ` point - like ' regions as a very special case .",
    "second , in order to stabilize the approximation process , a lossy layer with the material parameters satisfying certain mild compatibility integral conditions is employed right between the cloaked and cloaking regions .",
    "the lossy layer is also very general and could be variable and even be anisotropic .",
    "third , the proposed cloaking scheme is shown to be capable of nearly cloaking an very general content , possibly including , at the same time , generic passive mediums , and sound - soft , sound - hard , and impedance - type obstacles , and some active sources or sinks as well .",
    "finally , in order to achieve a cloaking device of compact size , particularly for the case when @xmath1 is not ` point - like ' , assembled - by - components ( abc ) geometry is developed for both the virtual and physical spaces and the blow - up construction is based on concatenating different components . within the proposed framework , we show that the scattered wave field @xmath6 corresponding to a cloaking problem will converge to @xmath7 as @xmath4 , with @xmath7 being the scattered wave field corresponding to a sound - hard @xmath3 .",
    "the convergence result is used to theoretically justify the approximate full and partial invisibility cloaks , depending on the geometry of @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the convergence results are conducted in a much more general setting than what is needed for the invisibility cloaking , so they are of significant mathematical interest for their own sake . as for applications ,",
    "we construct three types of full and partial cloaks .",
    "some numerical experiments are also conducted to illustrate our theoretical results .",
    "it is interesting to note that in addition to the blow - up - a - single - point construction , the cloaking constructions based on blowing up an arc curve or a planar rectangle are also proposed and investigated in @xcite , and they respectively yield the so - called electromagnetic wormholes and carpet - cloaking .",
    "as discussed earlier , the regularized blow - up - a - single - point construction , namely the blow - up - a - small - region construction , has been extensively studied in the literature . using the general framework developed in the present work",
    ", one can easily construct the regularized electromagnetic wormholes and carpet - cloaking by employing non - singular materials . in this paper , we focus entirely on the transformation optics approach in achieving the cloaks .",
    "we would like to mention in passing other promising cloaking techniques which we did not consider in the present study including the one based on anomalous localized resonance @xcite , and another one based on special ( object - dependent ) coatings @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present the general blow - up construction of the proposed regularized cloaks and give some relevant discussions .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the convergence analysis in the virtual space .",
    "section 4 is on the application of the results obtained in section 3 to the construction of full and partial cloaks in the physical space . in section 5",
    ", we develop the abc - geometry for both the virtual and physical spaces , and construct three types of full and partial cloaks that are new to the literature . finally ,",
    "in section 6 , we give some numerical simulations .",
    "in this section , we shall give the general construction of a regularized cloaking device via the transformation optics approach based on a blow - up mapping between the virtual and the physical spaces .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to pave the way for our convergence analysis study in the virtual space that shall be conducted in the next section .",
