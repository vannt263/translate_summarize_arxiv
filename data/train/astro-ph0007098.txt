    "extreme scattering events ( ese ) are a class of dramatic decreases ( @xmath3 50% ) in the flux density of radio sources near  1  ghz for several weeks bracketed by substantial increases (; fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "because of their simultaneity at different wavelengths and light travel time arguments , eses are likely a propagation effect @xcite .",
    "first identified toward extragalactic sources , eses have since been observed toward pulsars @xcite .    to date , the only other observational constraints on the structures responsible for eses  besides the light curves  are the lack of pulse broadening and the variation in the pulse times of arrival during the pulsar eses .",

    "figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] shows the ese of 1741@xmath0038 with the epochs of the various observations indicated .",
    "at each epoch , the polarization position angle  @xmath4 was measured at  6 to  10 frequencies and then fit , by minimizing @xmath5 and accounting for @xmath6 ambiguities , as a function of the observing wavelength , @xmath7 .",
    "the same procedure was used for 1741@xmath0038 and for the parallactic angle calibrator 1725@xmath8044 .",
    "based on the relative invariability of rm toward 1725@xmath8044 and 1741@xmath0038 , conclude @xmath9  rad  m@xmath10 during the .",
    "this upper limit implies an upper limit on the mean magnetic field parallel to the line of sight of @xmath1   for a typical value of the free electron column density through the structure , @xmath11  pc  @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this upper limit is much larger than the typical interstellar field strength but enhancement of the ambient field to @xmath13  mg is possible within a shock front @xcite .",
    "alternately , @xmath14 may be small if the field is disordered or if the ionized region is not magnetized .",
    "comparison of the visibility data during the ese to those obtained after the ese ( 1994 july  8) show the source to be more resolved during the .",
    "the excess angular broadening is @xmath15  mas , implying that the ese structure contributed a scattering measure  @xmath16  . in turn",
    ", the pulse broadening of a background pulsar should be @xmath17  @xmath18s at  1  ghz , consistent with the observed lack of broadening during pulsar eses @xcite .",
    "the refractive models commonly used to explain eses predict that the source s flux density and angular diameter should be highly correlated .",
    "we observe an _ anti - correlation_. simple stochastic broadening models require much more scattering ( 2  mas ) than is observed .",
    "we consider it likely that both refractive defocussing and stochastic broadening are occurring .",
    "we were unable to test a key prediction of refractive models ",
    "angular position wander of the background source  because these observations had no absolute position information .",
    "a second prediction is multiple imaging . during this ese , any secondary image(s )",
    "must have been extremely faint ; multiple imaging , with the secondary image slightly offset from the primary , is unlikely to explain the increase in angular diameter because no other effects of strong refraction are seen ( cf .  also ) .",
    "we also observe little , if any , ese - induced anisotropy in the vlbi images .",
    "if ese lenses are filamentary structures @xcite , they must be extended _ along _ the line of sight , a possibility also suggested by .",
    "at all epochs the opacity spectra show the presence of a strong absorption feature near  5  and a typical rms determined outside the line of @xmath19 .",
    "there is no gross change in the absorption line during the ese nor do any additional absorption components appear . between any two epochs @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",

    "tsas would have @xmath24  and @xmath25  k. our @xmath26 limit marginally excludes a connection between tsas and eses .",
    "propose au - scale molecular clouds in the galactic halo precisely to explain eses .",
    "the clouds would be cold , @xmath27  k , and dense enough to be opaque in the line .",
    "eses would result from the photoionized skins of the clouds .",
    "we see no @xmath28 features ( walker  2000 , private communication , has since suggested @xmath29 )",
    ". however , the clouds could have velocities approaching 500  , while the observed velocity range is no more than 250  significant absorption could have been present outside of our velocity range .",
    "salient aspects of this observational program are    * @xmath30  rad  m@xmath10 implying a magnetic field within the scatterer of @xmath1  . * no change in the vlbi structure , except a 0.7  mas _ increase _ in the angular diameter .",
    "this increase is _ not _ consistent with that expected from a purely refractive model : eses must result from both broadening and defocussing within the ionized structures . *",
    "@xmath31 implying that the column density associated with the ese structure is @xmath32 .",
    "tiny - scale atomic structures are marginally ruled out ; -opaque , halo molecular clouds would be excluded , but the observed velocity range covers only 25% of the allowed range .",
