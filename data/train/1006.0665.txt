    "irby measured the time interval between detection of the annihilation photons from a @xmath2 source  and obtained @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this is a surprising result since , in his experiment , the annihilation photons originate in a source a few @xmath10 thick and a photon travels almost @xmath11 in air in this time .    to explain these observations , irby generalized the einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite example of position and momentum as elements of reality to include time and energy dependence @xcite . using entangled spins as an illustration , he showed that restriction of one observable leads to reduced nonlocality of its conjugate .",
