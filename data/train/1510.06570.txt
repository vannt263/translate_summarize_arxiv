    "the three body problem is a classical one and the formal solution is given in terms of the faddeev equations @xcite . although formally these equations are very easy and intuitive , the technical implementation is rather involved and usually some approximations are always done @xcite .",
    "advances in this field using chiral lagrangians have also been done @xcite . a different approach , using as input unitarized amplitudes obtained from chiral lagrangians was done in @xcite for states of three mesons , in @xcite for two mesons and a baryon and in @xcite for one meson and two baryons . a different approach , using separable potentials fitted to two body data , is also done in @xcite for two mesons and a baryon",
    "are studied . in @xcite , the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 systems with a chiral @xmath10 interaction and a phenomenological @xmath11 potential . in the present work we deal with the interaction of the three - particle system composed of a @xmath12 , a @xmath13 and a @xmath14 meson .",
    "the three - body approach has helped to bring more insight in the understanding of different observed resonances , as in the case of the @xmath15 @xcite , that was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite as a molecular resonance of the coupled system @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite the baryonic resonance @xmath18 @xcite was proposed as a @xmath19 system .",
    "the mesonic states @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite as multi-@xmath12 states , interpreting all these resonances as molecular states made of two , three and up to six @xmath12 mesons respectively .",
    "this strong interaction with many @xmath12 mesons with alligned spins was also investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was found that the @xmath25-multi-@xmath12 interaction can dynamically generate the observed @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 states @xcite .    in this work , as in @xcite , the three - body interaction is solved using as input the two - body interaction of the composing hadrons given by the chiral unitary approach .",
    "this two - body interaction in the present case , is obtained from the lowest order lagrangian which describes the interaction of pseudoscalar plus vector mesons @xcite , called the local hidden gauge approach , after the unitarization of the tree level amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the extension to the charm sector of the local hidden gauge approach @xcite and its success in the description of known @xmath30 states , plus the prediction of the @xmath31 , which was found later in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , motivated the aplication of this formalism to the study of the @xmath32-multi-@xmath12 interaction @xcite , the three - body interaction of the @xmath33 system @xcite and of the @xmath34 system @xcite .",
    "we follow here the analogous aplication of the two - body interaction of the @xmath4 @xcite system to solve the three - body interaction of the @xmath35 system .",
    "one of the findings of @xcite is the existence of bound states in spin @xmath6 for the @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 systems respectively , as a consequence of the strong vector - vector interaction in this sector .",
    "the fact that these @xmath6 states are very bound in all the cases , since the binding energy found is @xmath39 mev , justifies the fixed center approximation to the faddeev equations ( fca ) .",
    "this approximation is often used @xcite and it was also used in the previous works of refs .",
    "it is justified since two of the particles form a bound cluster that is not much affected by the scattering of the third particle @xcite . in the language of quantum field theory , the fca was identified with the limit of neglecting the three - momentum of the two heavier particles in the propagators , and then it is only the third , the lighter particle , the one who finally interacts with the cluster @xcite .    in the following sections we will explain in detail the formalism employed to solve the interaction , and we will show the results that we obtain with this model for the case in which the pair of @xmath40 mesons are composing a cluster of spin 2 and isospin 0 .",
    "we will evaluate the sensitivity of this model to the free parameters and some of the different assumptions , and finally , present the conclusions and scope of this work .",
    "in the fca the @xmath41 and @xmath42 mesons will be regarded forming a cluster for which we know its wave function .",
    "then we can construct the diagramatic series describing the @xmath12 meson interacting with the cluster , fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme - for - t1 - 2 ] , which can be accounted for in terms of two partition functions , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , which sum all the multiple scattering terms of particle 3 beginning with particle 1 or 2 respectively .",
    "the partition functions satisfy the following coupled equations , @xmath45 taking @xmath46 and @xmath47 as a common factor in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : t_1-ffc - dots ] ) and ( [ eq : t_2-ffc - dots ] ) respectively , we arrive to the coupled faddeev equations in the fixed center approximation for the particle @xmath48 and @xmath49 : @xmath50 now @xmath51 is the propagator for the @xmath12 meson folded with the wave function of the cluster and we will focus on it later . solving eqs . and we will be able to construct the total three - body @xmath52 matrix , @xmath53    in the isospin basis the @xmath12 is a triplet @xmath54 and the @xmath41 and @xmath42 are doublets @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "we will calculate the @xmath57 interaction in spin @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath59 systems have been studied previously in the formalism of the local hidden gauge approach and heavy quark spin symmetry @xcite .",
    "one of the results of this previous work is the absence of bound states of the @xmath1 system in isospin @xmath60 , due to the weakness of the interaction in this sector .",
    "the bound states are found in isospin 0 and we are interested in those of spin @xmath61 .",
    "we will take the value of the @xmath1 cluster mass for @xmath62 as @xmath63 mev , obtained whithout considering the coupling to the @xmath59 channel .",
    "the consequence of including bottomed strange mesons as a coupled channel is that the mass of the @xmath6 state is obtained as @xmath64 mev @xcite .",
    "so the influence of this latter channel can be neglected .",
    "these results legitimate the use of this state as a @xmath1 bound state .",
    "we will project the scattering amplitudes of the three - body system into proper states of total isospin @xmath60 in terms of two particle isospin states , with the restriction of considering the @xmath1 system as an isospin zero state .",
    "@xmath65 when we make the projection @xmath66 it must be taken into account that @xmath67 relates particles @xmath48 and @xmath68 , i.e. , it describes the @xmath69 system . with @xmath70",
    "we are labelling the @xmath52 matrix for @xmath71 interaction .",

    "if one writes explicitly the expression for the double scattering , one also finds a different combination of @xmath87 factors than in the two former cases . in order to sum the different terms in the fca series with the same normalization",
    "a redefinition of amplitudes is convenient and this was done in @xcite .",
