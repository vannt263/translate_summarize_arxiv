    "shortly after the achievement of bose - einstein condensation of dilute , magnetically trapped alkali atoms@xcite , the investigation of collective excitations in these systems has become a very active research field ( see @xcite for a recent theoretical review ) .",
    "the high accuracy of frequency measurements and the sensitivity of collective phenomena to interaction effects makes them good candidates to unravel the dynamical correlation of the many - body system .",
    "so far , experimental results have been obtained for low - lying collective modes of a trapped condensate in a wide temperature regime , including breathing modes @xcite , surface modes @xcite , and the scissors mode @xcite .",
    "these experiments have in turn stimulated a considerable amount of theoretical work .",
    "recently the quantum degenerate regime has also been reached in a magnetically trapped fermi gas @xcite , and in a mixture of bose and fermi particles @xcite .",
    "the latter system is in particular interesting since it serves as one typical example in which the intermingled particles obey different statistics . up to date the static property @xcite ,",
    "the phase diagram and phase separation @xcite , stability conditions @xcite and collective excitations @xcite of trapped boson - fermion mixtures have been theoretically investigated . in a recent experiment , the collapse of a degenerated fermi gas caused by the strong attractive interaction with a bose - einstein condensate has been observed in an atomic mixture of @xmath0k@xmath1rb @xcite , and measurements of collective excitations might be available soon also in such systems .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the collective excitations of magnetically trapped boson - fermion binary mixtures in two different regimes : a collisionless regime where the collision rate is small compared with the frequencies of particle motion in the trap and a hydrodynamic ( collisional ) regime in which collisions are sufficiently strong to ensure local thermodynamic equilibrium . from the experimental point of view the temperature @xmath2 of all the realized boson - fermion mixtures is around the fermi temperature @xmath3 ( more precisely , @xmath4 @xcite ) , and the systems are possibly in or close to the hydrodynamic regime , since the sympathetic cooling technique used in the experiments usually requires a large boson - fermion interaction strength so that the frequent collisions between fermions and bosons can foster the local thermal equilibrium and ensure efficient thermalization of the fermionic component to reach the quantum degeneracy .",
    "of course , as far as the strongly degenerate regime ( where @xmath5 ) is concerned , the collisions are rare because of fermi statistic , and the systems will be finally in the collisionless regime .    several theoretical analysis",
    "have already been presented for the collective excitations of a _ spherically _ trapped boson - fermion mixture .",
    "the collisionless modes are considered by a sum - rule approach @xcite or in the random - phase approximation @xcite .",
    "the collisional collective oscillations are discussed by minguzzi and tosi @xcite , however , limited to the surface modes at weak fermion - boson coupling . on the other hand , the _ homogeneous _ boson - fermion mixtures have also been analytically studied @xcite .",
    "the repulsion between the bogoliubov phonon mode and zero - sound mode @xcite ( or anderson mode @xcite ) , is predicted when the degenerated fermi gas is in the normal collisionless limit ( or in the superfluid phase ) .    in this paper , we shall analyze systematically the collisionless and hydrodynamic monopole and quadrupole modes in the presence of spherical as well as cylindrically symmetric traps @xcite .",
    "we discuss in some detail the behavior of those modes against boson - fermion coupling at different boson - boson interaction strength . in the spherical traps , we find that the monopole frequency coincides in the collisionless regime and in the hydrodynamic one , suggesting that it might be undamped in all collisional regimes .",
    "in contrast , for the quadrupole mode the frequency differs dramatically in these two limits .",
    "in particular , in the hydrodynamic regime the quadrupole oscillations with equal bosonic and fermionic amplitudes are found to generate an exact eigenstate of the system , resembling the kohn mode for the dipole excitation .",
    "analytic solutions valid at weak and medium fermion - boson coupling are also deduced and discussed .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we derive equations of the low - energy collective excitation of a boson - fermion mixture in the thomas - fermi approximation by means of a scaling ansatz . in sec .",
    "iii we first briefly describe the parameters and the numerical procedure employed in the present calculation .",
    "we then turn to detailed discussion of the results obtained by analyzing the dependence of the mode frequencies on the boson - fermion coupling and boson - boson interaction strength , the ground - state density distributions , and the mixing between bosonic and fermionic collective oscillations .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary and conclusions .",
    "we consider a dilute spin - polarized boson - fermion mixture trapped in a cylindrically symmetric harmonic oscillator potential at low temperature . in the semi - classical thomas - fermi approximation , the normal fermi gas evolves according to the boltzmann - vlasov kinetic equation @xcite ( see the eq .",

    "the collisions are rare and we can safely neglect the collision term ( @xmath6 ) that accounts for the damping of collective modes . on the opposite of the hydrodynamic regime , the collision term dominates and we resort to the euler equation of motion @xcite , which can be deduced from boltzmann - vlasov kinetic equation under the assumption of local equilibrium for fermions @xcite . for the bosonic part , we shall apply the same stringari s hydrodynamic formulation @xcite in both regimes , since the dynamics of the condensate is less affected by the collisions @xcite .      according to the stringari s hydrodynamic description @xcite",

    "a useful approximation , in the first order of @xmath14 , is to assume the scaling form of the solution as a priori , and fulfill it on average by integrating over the spatial coordinates .",

    "in the section iiia , we briefly estimate the criterion for establishing the hydrodynamic regime . in the next sections",
    "iiib and iiic , we analyze the collective modes in the collisionless and hydrodynamic regime for a spherical trap .",
    "the results for a cylindrically symmetric trap will be presented in section iiid .",
    "a hydrodynamic regime is established in the low temperature alkali vapor when the inequality @xmath134 holds , where @xmath135 being the collision time for incoherent scattering of fermions against the condensate and @xmath136 being on the scale of the trap frequency ( @xmath137 ) for the low - lying modes . at low temperature ,",

    "( [ bfd ] ) will vanish and consequently the bosonic and fermion part in the determinant ( [ modes ] ) will be completely decoupled .",

    "the degree of mixing is enhanced as one increases @xmath121 .",
    "_ ( b ) quadrupole_. for the quadrupole excitation ( figure 2 ) , the lower and higher energy mode becomes bosonic and fermionic oscillation , respectively .",
    "to the first order of @xmath120 the frequencies of the lower and the higher quadrupole modes are given by @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "for those modes , similar mechanisms as for the monopole mode are still at work concerning the dependence on @xmath120 . however , the role of the boson - fermion interaction is much reduced compared with the monopole case as seen by the factor @xmath185 in eq .",
    "( [ quad ] ) , which reflects that the quadrupole oscillation has 5 different components @xcite . in addition , the behavior of the high - lying fermionic mode is somewhat simpler .",
    "the frequency is always decreases around @xmath129 as @xmath120 increases .      in section",
    "ii , we have analytically showed that in a spherical trap the frequency of monopole oscillations coincides in the collisionless and hydrodynamic regime . here",
    "we find a dramatic difference for the quadrupole mode . in the figure 4",
    ", we plot the frequencies and mixing angles of the quadrupole modes in the hydrodynamic regime against @xmath120 .",
    "the parameters are the same as that in figures 1 and 2 . compared with the result for the quadrupole mode in the collisionless regime ( figure 2 ) , an interesting feature emerges : the frequency of the low - lying mode ( high - lying mode ) is always fixed to @xmath186 in the region i and iii ( region ii ) , independently of the value of @xmath120 , and the corresponding mixing angle is exactly @xmath182 even around @xmath129 .",
    "this strongly suggests that in this case the collective oscillation with equal bosonic and fermionic amplitudes generates an exact eigenstate of the system , regardless of the boson - fermion interaction .",
    "it resembles the kohn mode in the isotropic harmonic traps .",
    "indeed , the behavior of the frequencies shown in figure 4 is quite similar to that of a dipole mode in the collisionless limit ( see , for example , the figure 2c in ref@xcite ) .",
    "the above feature can also be explained explicitly from eq .",
    "( [ quad2 ] ) . for the case considered here , @xmath124 , we have @xmath187 /10\\right\\ } ^{1/2}$ ] , and thus one branch of @xmath188 will always be @xmath189 .",
    "the strong mixing of the bosonic and fermionic oscillation stated above in fact arises from the `` on resonance '' condition , that is , the frequency of the bosonic and fermionic quadrupole modes in hydrodynamic regime is degenerate in the noninteracting limit of @xmath129 . as shown in figure 5 , once one moves away from the `` on resonance '' condition by changing @xmath190 , the degree of mixing will be much reduced .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider a cylindrical trap that is more relevant to the experiment .",
    "figures 6 and 7 , respectively , display the frequencies of each mode for a cigar - shaped ( @xmath191 ) and disk - shaped ( @xmath192 ) trap in the collisionless ( thick lines ) and hydrodynamic ( thin lines ) regime . as the monopole and quadrupole modes are coupled away from @xmath193 , we denote the two higher and two lower modes as quasi - monopole and quasi - quadrupole ones , respectively . in the literature",
    ", the former one is also called as transverse breathing mode in the limit of @xmath194 . as one may expect , in the cylindrical trap the frequency of quasi - monopole mode in the collisionless and hydrodynamic regime",
    "is no longer degenerate .    _",
    "( a ) a cigar - shaped trap_. for the quasi - monopole excitation ( figure 6a ) , the lower and higher energy mode in both regimes are fermionic and bosonic oscillations . in region",
    "i and iii , the frequencies for the high - lying mode in the collisionless and hydrodynamic regime are almost the same and they only differ sightly in region ii . in contrast , for the low - lying mode the frequencies in two regimes have significant differences .",
    "in particular , as @xmath120 decreases towards the instability point of the ground state , the frequency in the collisionless regime rises up steeply , while the one in the hydrodynamic regime shows a sharp decrease . for the quasi - quadrupole excitation ( figure 6b ) , on the other hand , the frequencies for each mode bears a lot of similarity as that in the spherical case .",
    "we thus do nt discuss them further .",
    "_ ( b ) a disk - shaped trap_. in this case ( figure 7 ) , the lower and higher energy mode for both quasi - monopole and quasi - quadrupole excitations in the collisionless regime are bosonic and fermionic oscillations , respectively .",
    "the opposite is true in the hydrodynamic regime .",
    "most interestingly , the soften of the mode frequency towards the instability point of the ground state now appears in the low - lying mode for the quasi - quadrupole excitations , rather than the monopole one .",
    "ultracold boson - fermion mixtures of alkali atoms have recently been the subject of intensive experimental research . as an important tool to characterize the behaviour of this kind of many - body system ,",
    "the investigation of collective oscillations will be of particular interest . in this paper , with the help of thomas - fermi approximation and a scaling solution we have studied the behavior of monopole and quadrupole excitations against the boson - fermion interaction in two limiting cases : the collisionless and hydrodynamic regime . for a spherical trap , the frequency of monopole mode is identical in both regimes , analogous to that of a classical gas , which is undamped in all collisional regimes .",
    "in contrast , the frequency of quadrupole mode differs largely in these two limits .",
    "most interestingly , in the case of same trapping frequency for the two components ( @xmath195 ) and hydrodynamic regime , the quadrupole oscillations with equal bosonic and fermionic amplitudes are found to generate an exact eigenstate of the system , regardless of the boson - fermion interaction .",
    "it indeed resembles the kohn mode for the dipole excitation .",
    "while we have restricted the discussion to the collisionless and hydrodynamic regime , it should be explicitly remarked from the experimental point of view that it is more interesting to investigate the _ crossover _ between these two limits @xcite , which might be realized in the experiment by changing the temperature or controlling the particle - particle interaction through feshbach resonances . in theory ,",
    "such crossover might be investigated by adding a collision term ( @xmath6 ) to eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) .",
    "we are aware of that the above results are based on the assumption of the simple scaling solution .",
    "its validity has been partly justified by the good agreement between our results and that obtained by a sum - rule approach . however , in case of large boson - fermion interaction , the spectrum of lowest collective excitations might be fragmented @xcite . as a result , both the sum - rule approach and",
    "the approximation of simple scaling solution will break down . in those regions ,",
    "a refined treatment is deserved .",
    "we acknowledge stimulating discussions with g. modugno , m. modugno , f. ferlaino , and m. inguscio .",
