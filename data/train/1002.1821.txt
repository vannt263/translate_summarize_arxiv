    "the falicov - kimball model ( fkm ) was first proposed by l. m. falicov and kimball @xcite to analyze the thermodynamics of semiconductor - metal transitions in smb@xmath1 and transition - metal oxides @xcite .",
    "the model incorporates two types of electrons : one type can undergo hopping between sites and the other type can not hop , thereby being localized at the sites .",
    "thus , in its introduction , fkm described the coulomb interaction between mobile @xmath2 band electrons and localized @xmath3 band electrons .",
    "there have been a multitude of subsequent physical interpretations based on this interaction , including that of localized ions attractively interacting with mobile electrons , which yields crystalline formation @xcite .",
    "another physical interpretation of the model is as a binary alloy , in which the localized degree of freedom reflects a or b atom occupation @xcite . in this paper",
    "we employ the original language , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 electrons as conduction and localized electrons with a repulsive interaction between them .    since there is no interacting spin degree of freedom in the hamiltonian , the model",
    "is traditionally studied in the spinless case , commonly referred as the spinless fkm ( sfkm ) and which is in fact a special case of the hubbard model in which one type of spin ( _ e.g. _ , spin - up ) can not hop @xcite . in spite of its simplicity , this model is able to describe many physical phenomena in rare - earth and transition metal compounds , such as metal transitions , charge ordering , _",
    "etc_.    beyond the introduction of the spin degree of freedom for both electrons @xcite , there also exist many extensions of the original model .",
    "the most widely studied extensions include multiband hybridization @xcite , @xmath4 hopping @xcite , correlated hopping @xcite , non - bipartite lattices @xcite , hard - core bosonic particles @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite , and next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xcite .",
    "exhaustive reviews are available in refs .",
    "the wider physical application of both the basic fkm and its extended versions have aimed at explaining valence transitions @xcite , metal - insulator transitions @xcite , mixed valence phenomena @xcite , raman scattering @xcite , colossal magnetoresistance @xcite , electronic ferroelectricity @xcite , and phase separation @xcite .    after the initial works on the fkm @xcite , the literature had to wait 14 years for the celebrated first rigorous results .",
    "two independent studies , by kennedy and lieb @xcite and by brandt and schmidt @xcite , proved for dimensions @xmath5 that , at low temperatures , fkm has long - range charge order with the formation of two sublattices .",
    "various methods have been used in the study of the fkm . in most of these studies , either the @xmath6 infinite - dimensional",
    "limit or @xmath7 low - dimensional cases have been investigated .",
    "studies include limiting cases such as ground - state analysis or the large interaction limit .",
    "renormalization - group theory @xcite offers fully physical and fairly easy techniques to yield global phase diagrams and other physical phenomena .",
    "this non - trivial nature of sfkm motivated us to determine the global phase diagram of the model , which resulted in a richly complex phase diagram involving charge ordering and phase coexistence , as exemplified in fig . 1 .",
    "we use the general method for arbitrary dimensional quantum systems developed by a. falicov and berker @xcite to obtain the global phase diagram of the sfkm in @xmath8 , in terms of both the chemical potentials and the densities of the two types of electrons , for all temperatures .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec.ii , we introduce the sfkm and , in sec.iii , we present the method @xcite",
    ". calculated phase diagrams are presented in sec.iv , for the non - hopping ( @xmath9 ) classical submodel and for the hopping ( @xmath10 ) quantum regimes of small , intermediate , and large @xmath11 .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec.v .",
    "the sfkm is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes that the sum runs over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites .",
    "note that , as in all renormalization - group studies , the hamiltonian has absorbed the inverse temperature .",
    "the dimensionless hopping strength @xmath15 can therefore be used as the inverse temperature . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively creation and annihilation operators for the conduction electrons at lattice site @xmath18 , obeying the anticommutation rules @xmath19 and @xmath20 , while @xmath21 and @xmath22 are electron number operators for conduction and localized electrons respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath22 takes the values @xmath23 or @xmath24 , for site @xmath18 being respectively occupied or unoccupied by a localized electron .",
    "the particles are fermions , so that the pauli exclusion principle forbids the occupation of a given site by more than one localized electron or by more than one conduction electron .",
    "the first term of the hamiltonian is the kinetic energy term , responsible for the quantum nature of the model .",
    "the system being invariant under sign change of @xmath15 ( via a phase change of the local basis states in one sublattice ) , only positive @xmath15 values are considered .",
    "the second term is the screened on - site coulomb interaction between localized and conduction electrons , with positive and negative @xmath25 values corresponding to attractive and repulsive interactions .",
    "we consider only the repulsive case , since the attractive case can be connected to the repulsive one by the particle - hole symmetry possessed by either type of electrons .",
    "particle - hole symmetries are achieved by the transformations of @xmath26 for the localized electrons and @xmath27 , @xmath28 for the conduction electrons , where , for a bipartite lattice , @xmath29 for one sublattice and @xmath30 for the other  @xcite .",
    "the last two terms of the hamiltonian are the chemical potential terms with @xmath31 and @xmath32 being the chemical potential for a localized and conduction electron .    in order to carry out a renormalization - group transformation easily ,",
    "we trivially rearrange the hamiltonian given in eq.([eq:1 ] ) into the equivalent form of @xmath33\\\\              \\equiv&\\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle}\\left[-\\beta\\mathcal{h}_{i , j}\\right ] ,          \\end{split}\\ ] ] where , for a @xmath2-dimensional hypercubic lattice , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the two - site hamiltonian involving only nearest - neighbor sites @xmath18 and @xmath38 .",
    "in @xmath39 the hamiltonian in eq.([eq:2 ] ) is @xmath40.\\ ] ] the renormalization - group procedure traces out half of the degrees of freedom in the partition function @xcite , @xmath41}\\\\              = & \\mbox{tr}_{\\mbox{\\tiny odd } } e^{\\sum_i^{\\mbox{\\tiny odd}}\\left[-\\beta\\mathcal{h}_{i-1,i}-\\beta\\mathcal{h}_{i , i+1}\\right]}\\\\              \\simeq&\\prod_i^{\\mbox{\\tiny odd}}\\mbox{tr}_ie^{\\left[-\\beta\\mathcal{h}_{i-1,i}-\\beta\\mathcal{h}_{i , i+1}\\right]}\\\\              = & \\prod_{i}^{\\mbox{\\tiny odd}}e^{-\\beta^{\\prime } \\mathcal{h}^{\\prime}_{i-1,i+1}}\\\\              \\simeq&e^{\\sum_i^{\\mbox{\\tiny odd}}\\left[-\\beta^{\\prime}\\mathcal{h}^{\\prime}_{i-1,i+1}\\right]}=e^{-\\beta^{\\prime}\\mathcal{h}^{\\prime}}.          \\end{split}\\ ] ] here and throughout this paper primes are used for the renormalized system .",
    "thus , as an approximation , the non - commutativity of the operators beyond three consecutive sites is ignored at each successive length scale , in the two steps indicated by @xmath42 in the above equation .",
    "earlier studies @xcite have established the quantitative validity of this procedure .",
    "the above transformation is algebraically summarized in @xmath43 where @xmath44 are three successive sites .",
    "the operator @xmath45 acts on two - site states , while the operator @xmath46 acts on three - site states .",
    "thus we can rewrite eq.([eq:5 ] ) in matrix form as @xmath47 where state variables @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 can be one of the four possible single - site @xmath53 states at each site @xmath54 , namely one of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "eq.([eq:6 ] ) indicates that the unrenormalized @xmath59 matrix on the right - hand side is contracted into the renormalized @xmath60 matrix on the left - hand side .",
    "we use two - site basis states , @xmath61 , and three - site basis states , @xmath62 , in order to block - diagonalize the matrices in eq.([eq:6 ] ) .",
    "these basis states are the eigenstates of total localized and conduction electron numbers .",

    "the localized electron density is @xmath188 at the sinks of co@xmath87 and co@xmath88 , while @xmath189 at the sinks of co@xmath89 and co@xmath92 , which throughout the corresponding phases calculationally translates @xcite as low ( @xmath2 ) and high ( @xmath190 ) localized electron densities , respectively .",
    "recall that on phase labels ( co and @xmath154 ) throughout this paper , the first and second subscripts respectively describe localized and conduction electron densities .",
    "the conduction electron density is @xmath191 at the sinks of co@xmath87 and co@xmath89 , while @xmath192 at the sinks of co@xmath88 and co@xmath92 .",
    "the nearest - neighbor conduction electron number correlation is @xmath193 at the sinks of co@xmath87 and co@xmath89 , while @xmath194 at the sinks of co@xmath88 and co@xmath92 .",
    "consequently , for conduction electrons , if a given site is occupied , its nearest - neighbor site is empty at the sinks of co@xmath87 and co@xmath89 .",
    "the co@xmath88 and co@xmath92 phases are connected to the co@xmath87 and co@xmath89 phases by particle - hole interchange on the conduction electrons .",
    "thus , in the co phases , the lattice can be divided into two sublattices with different electron densities .",
    "the behavior at the co sinks therefore indicates charge ordered phases at finite temperatures , as also previously seen in ground - state studies @xcite .",
    "note that this charge ordering is a purely quantum mechanical effect caused by hopping , since the sfkm hamiltonian [ eq.([eq:1 ] ) ] studied here does not contain an interaction between electrons at different sites .    in the small @xmath11 regime ,",
    "all phase boundaries around the co phases are second order . as seen in the expanded fig .",
    "4 , all four co phases and all four regions of the @xmath154 phase ( as narrow slivers ) meet at @xmath184 and @xmath185 , half - filling point of both localized and conduction electrons .",
    "all characteristics of the sinks and boundary fixed points are given in tables [ tab:3 ] and [ tab:4 ] .",
    "in this subsection , the phase diagram for @xmath195 , representative of the intermediate - interaction regime , is presented .",
    "[ fig:4 ] gives constant @xmath177 cross - sections .",
    "first - order phase boundaries appear in the central region of the phase diagram , at and near the half filling of both localized and conduction electrons .    for low values of @xmath15 ( left panels of fig .",
    "5 ) , equivalent to high temperatures , two first - order phase boundaries , bounded by four critical points c , pinch at a quadruple point q. in the ( left - lower ) density - density phase diagram , four phase separation ( coexistence ) regions mark the first - order phase transitions . inside these regions , coexistence ( phase separation ) occurs between the phases on each side of these regions , as indicated on the figure . the tie line of the quadruple point is shown as a thin straight line .",
    "all four @xmath154 phases coexist ( phase separate ) on this line .",
    "as @xmath15 increases ( temperature decreases ) , the four charge - ordered co phases appear again at @xmath186 , as seen in the leftmost panels of fig .",
    "1 . the co phases again occur at and near half filling of conduction electrons for the entire range of localized electron densities . in the right panels of fig . 5",
    ", the second - order transition lines bounding the co phases terminate at two critical endpoints e @xcite and two double critical endpoints e@xmath182 on the first - order line in the central region ( zoomed in fig . 6 ) .",
    "thus , first - order transitions and phase separation occur between the pairs of @xmath85 and @xmath81,@xmath85 and co@xmath87,co@xmath89 and co@xmath88,co@xmath92 and @xmath83 , @xmath86 and @xmath83 phases , as indicated on fig . 6 , at and near the half filling of both localized and conduction electrons .",
    "the evolution of the phase diagrams between right and left panels of fig . 5 are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the evolution of the global phase diagram , as the interaction strength is increased , is seen in the phase diagrams in fig .",
    "the co phases emerge again at @xmath186 . with increasing @xmath15 ( decreasing temperature ) , the co phases grow , until saturation seen in fig .",
    "the topology of the phase diagram with five phases stays the same for all @xmath196 .",
    "the constant @xmath177 cross - sections of the phase diagram are given in fig .",
    "7 . for @xmath197 , the double critical endpoints e@xmath182 have split into pairs of simple critical endpoints e , resulting in six separate critical endpoints . for @xmath198 ,",
    "the inner two critical endpoints have merged into a single double critical endpoint . for @xmath199 ,",
    "the double critical endpoint has split into two critical endpoints and the critical lines in the low - density and high - density localized electrons regions have disconnected from each other . in this strong interaction limit , the homogenous ( non - phase - separated ) charge - ordered phases occur again at and near half filling of conduction electrons , but at the low- or high - density limit of the localized electrons . away from these limits ,",
    "the charge - ordered phases occur in coexistence ( phase - separated from ) the disordered phases . at and near the half filling of both localized and conduction electrons , the coexistence of the disordered phases @xmath85 and",
    "@xmath83 occurs .",
    "two sets of three critical lines terminate in separate endpoints , as seen in the zoomed fig .",
    "9 . in this case , a characteristic shape of the density phase diagrams , which we dub _ chimaera _ coexistence , emerges . in the _ chimaera _ phase diagram , coexistence can be found for essentially the entire range of conduction electrons densities or for most of the range of localized electron densities . in the upper - right chemical - potential panel of fig .",
    "7 , the first - order phase boundary exhibits , from the left to right , a sequence of the maximum , minimum , maximum , minimum points ; the four corresponding tie lines are also shown in the lower - right density panel .",
    "these tie lines abut , on one end , very near maxima and minima of the lower and upper branches of the coexistence boundaries , thereby underpinning the distinctive _ chimaera _ topology .",
    "with this research , we have obtained the global phase diagram of the @xmath8 sfkm , which exhibits a fairly rich collection of phase diagram topologies :    for the @xmath9 classical submodel , we have obtained disordered ( @xmath154 ) regions , dilute and dense separately for localized and conduction electrons , but no phase transition between them .",
    "the repartition of these regions , delimited by renormalization - group flows , quantitatively stays the same for the whole @xmath11 range and is exactly as obtained in ref .",
    "for the whole @xmath11 range and @xmath200 , the classical submodel phase diagram is perturbed in such a way that regions @xmath81 and @xmath86 intercede between regions @xmath83 and @xmath85 , resulting in the shrinking and disappearing of the @xmath83 to @xmath85 passage .",
    "all @xmath154 regions have vanishing hopping density at their corresponding sinks .",
    "for the whole @xmath11 range , upon increasing @xmath15 ( lowering temperature ) , at @xmath186 four new phases ( co ) emerge with non - zero hopping density of @xmath201 at their sinks .",
    "these co phases are also either dilute or dense , separately , in the localized and conduction electrons ( co@xmath87 , co@xmath88 , co@xmath89 , and co@xmath92 ) and are all charge ordered in the conduction electrons , a wholly quantum mechanical effect . in these co phases",
    "the bipartite lattice is divided into two sublattices of alternating electron density .",
    "the co phases occur at or near the half filling of conduction electrons .",
    "the phase diagrams with all five phases for @xmath196 exhibit different topologies , for the small , intermediate , and large @xmath11 regimes :    for the small @xmath11 ( weak - interaction ) regime , all phase boundaries are second order .",
    "all five phases meet at @xmath184 and @xmath202 , the half - filling point of both localized and conduction electrons .    for the intermediate @xmath11 ( intermediate - interaction ) regime ,",
    "a first - order phase boundary emerges in the central region of the phase diagram .",
    "this first - order boundary is centered at @xmath184 and is bounded by two critical points c. the second - order lines bounding the co phases terminate at critical endpoints e and double critical endpoints e@xmath182 on the first - order boundary . due to this first - order phase transition at and near the half filling of both localized and conduction electrons ,",
    "a rich variety of phase separation ( phase coexistence ) occurs , as indicated on figs .",
    "1,5,6,7 .    for the large @xmath11 ( strong - interaction ) regime , as @xmath11 is increased , the critical endpoints pass through each other by merging and unmerging as double critical endpoints . for large @xmath11 , the co@xmath203 and co@xmath204 phases are detached from the co@xmath205 and co@xmath206 phases , forming two separate bundles , at high- and low - densities of localized electrons respectively .",
    "first - order transitions occur between the variously dense and dilute @xmath154 .",
    "the global phase diagram underpinning all of these cross - sections is decidedly quite complex .",
