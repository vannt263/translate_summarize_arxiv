    "this colloquium focuses on fluctuation relations and in particular on their quantum versions .",
    "these relations constitute a research topic that recently has attracted a great deal of attention . at the microscopic level ,",
    "matter is in a permanent state of agitation ; consequently many physical quantities of interest continuously undergo random fluctuations .",
    "the purpose of statistical mechanics is the characterization of the statistical properties of those fluctuating quantities from the known laws of classical and quantum physics that govern the dynamics of the constituents of matter .",
    "a paradigmatic example is the maxwell distribution of velocities in a rarefied gas at equilibrium , which follows from the sole assumptions that the micro - dynamics are hamiltonian , and that the very many system constituents interact via negligible , short range forces @xcite . besides the fluctuation of velocity ( or energy ) at equilibrium , one might be interested in the properties of other fluctuating quantities , e.g. heat and work , characterizing non - equilibrium transformations . imposed by the reversibility of microscopic dynamical laws , the fluctuation relations put severe restrictions on the form that the probability density function ( pdf ) of the considered non - equilibrium fluctuating quantities may assume .",

    "the precise meaning of these expressions will be amply clarified below .",

    "data courtesy of @xcite.,width=321 ]    as often happens in science , the historical development of theories is quite tortuous .",
    "fluctuation relations are no exception in this respect . without any intention of providing a thorough and complete historical account",
    ", we will mention below a few milestones that , in our view , mark crucial steps in the historical development of quantum fluctuation relations .",
    "the beginning of the story might be traced back to the early years of the last century , with the work of @xcite and @xcite first , and of @xcite and @xcite later , when it was found that the linear response of a system in thermal equilibrium as it is driven out of equilibrium by an external force , is determined by the fluctuation properties of the system in the initial equilibrium state .",
    "specifically , @xcite and @xcite found a relation between the mobility of a brownian particle ( encoding information about its response to an externally applied force ) and its diffusion constant ( encoding information about its equilibrium fluctuations ) . @xcite and @xcite discovered the corresponding relation between the resistance of a circuit and the spontaneous current fluctuations occurring in absence of an applied electric potential .",
    "the next prominent step was taken by @xcite who derived the previous results within a general quantum mechanical setting .",
    "the starting point of their analysis is a quantum mechanical system described by a hamiltonian @xmath12 .",
    "initially this system stays in a thermal equilibrium state at the inverse temperature @xmath13 , wherein @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "this state is described by a density matrix of canonical form ; i.e. , it is given by a gibbs state @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the partition function of the unperturbed system and @xmath17 denotes trace over its hilbert space . at later times",
    "@xmath18 the system is perturbed by the action of an external , in general time - dependent force @xmath19 that couples to an observable @xmath20 of the system .",
    "the dynamics of the system then is governed by the modified , time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath21 the approach of @xcite was further systematized by @xcite and in particular by @xcite who proved that the linear response is determined by a response function @xmath22 , which gives the deviation @xmath23 of the expectation value of an observable @xmath24 to its unperturbed value as @xmath25 @xcite showed that the response function can be expressed in terms of the commutator of the observables @xmath26 and @xmath27 , as @xmath28\\rangle / i\\hbar$ ] ( the superscript @xmath29 denoting the heisenberg picture with respect to the unperturbed dynamics . )",
    "moreover , kubo derived the general relation @xmath30 between differently ordered thermal correlation functions and deduced from it the celebrated quantum fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite , reading : @xmath31 where @xmath32 , denotes the fourier transform of the symmetrized , stationary equilibrium correlation function @xmath33 , and @xmath34 the fourier transform of the response function @xmath35 .",
    "note that the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is valid also for many - particle systems independent of the respective particle statistics .",
    "besides offering a unified and rigorous picture of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , the theory of kubo also included other important advancements in the field of non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "specifically , we note the celebrated onsager - casimir reciprocity relations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these relations state that , as a consequence of _ microreversibility _ , the matrix of transport coefficients that connects applied forces to so - called fluxes in a system close to equilibrium consists of a symmetric and an anti - symmetric block .",
    "the symmetric block couples forces and fluxes that have same parity under time - reversal and the antisymmetric block couples forces and fluxes that have different parity .",
    "most importantly , the analysis of @xcite opened the possibility for a systematic advancement of response theory , allowing in particular to investigate the existence of higher order fluctuation - dissipation relations , beyond linear regime .",
    "this task was soon undertaken by @xcite , who pointed out a hierarchy of irreversible thermodynamic relationships .",
    "these higher order fluctuation dissipation relations were investigated in detail by stratonovich for markovian system , and later by @xcite for non - markovian systems , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "i ) and references therein .    even for arbitrary systems",
    "far from equilibrium the linear response to an applied force can likewise be related to tailored two - point correlation functions of corresponding stationary nonequilibrium fluctuations of the underlying _ unperturbed _ , stationary nonequilibrium system @xcite .",
    "these authors coined the expression `` fluctuation theorems '' for these relations .",
    "as in the near thermal equilibrium case , also in this case higher order nonlinear response can be linked to corresponding higher order correlation functions of those nonequilibrium fluctuations @xcite .    at the same time , in the late seventies of the last century @xcite provided a single compact _",
    "classical _ expression that contains fluctuation relations of all orders for systems that are at thermal equilibrium when unperturbed .",
    "this expression , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bk - gen - functional - identity ] ) below , can be seen as a fully nonlinear , exact and universal fluctuation relation .",
    "this @xcite formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bk - gen - functional - identity ] ) below , soon turned out useful in addressing the problem of connecting the deterministic and the stochastic descriptions of _ nonlinear _ dissipative systems @xcite .",
    "as it often happens in physics , the most elegant , compact and universal relations , are consequences of general physical symmetries . in the case of @xcite",
    "the fluctuation relation follows from the time reversal invariance of the equations of microscopic motion , combined with the assumption that the system initially resides in thermal equilibrium described by the classical analogue of the gibbs state , eq .",
    "( [ eq : varrho_0 ] ) .",
    "@xcite proved eq .",

    "their derivation will be reviewed in the next section . the quantum version ,",
    "( [ eq : q - j - gen - functional - identity ] ) , was not reported until very recently @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : work - not - observable ] we shall discuss the fundamental obstacles that prevented @xcite and @xcite who also studied this very quantum problem .",
    "a new wave of activity in fluctuation relations was initiated by the works of @xcite and @xcite on the statistics of the entropy produced in non - equilibrium steady states , and of @xcite on the statistics of work performed by a transient , time - dependent perturbation . since then",
    ", the field has generated grand interest and flourished considerably .",
    "the existing reviews on this topic mostly cover classical fluctuation relations @xcite , while the comprehensive review by @xcite provides a solid , though in parts technical account of the state of the art of quantum fluctuation theorems .",
    "with this work we want to present a widely accessible introduction to quantum fluctuation relations , covering as well the most recent decisive advancements .",

    "two ingredients are at the heart of fluctuation relations .",
    "the first one concerns the initial condition of the system under study .",
    "this is supposed to be in thermal equilibrium described by a canonical distribution of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : varrho_0 ] ) .",
    "it hence is of _ statistical _ nature .",
    "its use and properties are discussed in many textbooks on statistical mechanics .",
    "the other ingredient , concerning the _ dynamics _ of the system is the principle of microreversibility .",
    "this point needs some clarification since microreversibility is customarily understood as a property of autonomous ( i.e. , non - driven ) systems described by a time - independent hamiltonian ( * ? ? ?",
    "xv ) . on the contrary , here we are concerned with non - autonomous systems , governed by explicitly time - dependent hamiltonians . in the following",
    "we will analyze this principle for classical systems in a way that at first glance may appear rather formal but will prove indispensable later on . the analogous discussion of the quantum case will be given next in sec . [ subsec : q - microrev ] .",
    "we deal here with a classical system characterized by a hamiltonian that consists of an unperturbed part @xmath36 and a perturbation @xmath37 due to an external force @xmath19 that couples to the conjugate coordinate @xmath38 .",
    "then the total system hamiltonian becomes @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes a point in the phase space of the considered system . in the following",
    "we assume that the force acts within a temporal interval set by a starting time @xmath41 and a final time @xmath42 .",
    "the instantaneous force values @xmath19 are specified by a function @xmath43 , which we will refer to as the _ force protocol_. in the sequel , it will turn out necessary to clearly distinguish between the function @xmath43 and the value @xmath19 that it takes at a particular instant of time @xmath44 .    for these systems",
    "the principle of microreversibility holds in the following sense .",
    "the solution of hamilton s equations of motion assigns to each initial point in phase space @xmath45 a point @xmath46 at the later time @xmath47 $ ] , which is specified by the values of the force in the order of their appearance within the considered time span .",
    "hence , the position @xmath48 \\label{eq : varphi}\\ ] ] at time @xmath44 is determined by the flow @xmath49 $ ] which is a function of the initial point @xmath50 and a functional of the force protocol @xmath43.$ ] may of course only depend on the part of the protocol including times from @xmath51 up to time @xmath44 . ] in a computer simulation one can invert the direction of time and let run the trajectory backwards without problem .",
    "although , as experience evidences , it is impossible to actively revert the direction of time in any experiment , there is yet a way to run a time reversed trajectory in real time . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that the hamiltonian @xmath52 is time reversal invariant , i.e. that it remains unchanged if the signs of momenta are reverted .",

    "equation ( [ eq : microreversibility ] ) expresses the principle of microreversibility in driven systems .",
    "its meaning is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : microreversibility ] .",

    "an electric potential difference is applied to the two leads for a time @xmath42 . during this time",
    "the state of the double quantum dot is monitored by registering the current in the secondary circuit .",
    "this current was found to switch between the four values corresponding to the four quantum states mentioned above .",
    "the outcome of the experiment is a sequence @xmath424 of current values , with @xmath424 taking only four possible values . in other terms , the outcome of the experiment consists of a sequence @xmath425 ( with @xmath426 ) of joint eigenvalues of two commuting observables @xmath427 specifying the occupation of the left ( @xmath428 ) and right ( @xmath429 ) dots by single electrons at the time of the @xmath430 measurement .",
    "the presence of an exchange of entries within one time step of the form @xmath431 signals the transfer of one electron from left to right , and vice versa @xmath432 the transfer from right to left .",
    "thus , given a sequence @xmath425 , the total number @xmath433 $ ] of electrons transferred from left to right is obtained by subtracting the total number of right - to - left transfers from the total number of left - to - right transfers . it was found that , for observation times larger than a characteristic time @xmath399 , the fluctuation relation , @xmath434=p[-q]e^{\\beta v q}$ ] , eq .",
    "( [ eq : xft - matter ] ) , was satisfied with the actual temperature of the leads replaced by an effective temperature , see fig [ fig : histogram ] .",
    "the renormalization of temperature was explained as an effect due to an exchange of electrons occurring between the dots and the secondary circuit @xcite .",
    "the question however remains of how to connect this experiment in which the flux of electrons through an interface is monitored and the theory , leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : xft - matter ] ) , which instead prescribes only two measurements of total particle numbers in the reservoirs .",
    "the answer was given in @xcite , who showed that the exchange fluctuation relation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : xft - general ] ) , remains valid , if in addition to the two measurements of total energy and particle numbers occurring at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the evolution of a quantum system is interrupted by means of projective quantum measurements of any observable @xmath435 that commutes with the quantum time reversal operator @xmath209 .",
    "in other words , while the forward and backward probabilities are affected by the occurrence of intermediate measurement processes , their ratio remains unaltered .    in the experiment of @xcite one does not need to measure the initial and final content of particles in the reservoirs because the number of exchanged particles is inferred from the sequence of intermediate measurements outcomes @xmath425 .",
    "thus , thanks to the fact that quantum measurements do not alter the fluctuation relation , one may overcome the problem of measuring the energy and number of particles of the macroscopic reservoirs , by monitoring instead the flux through a microscopic junction .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the original motivation for the study of fluctuation relations was to overcome the limitations of linear response theory and to obtain relations connecting higher order response functions to fluctuation properties of the unperturbed system .",
    "as an indirect and partial confirmation of the fluctuation relations higher order static fluctuation - response relations can be tested experimentally .    such a validation was recently accomplished in coherent quantum transport experiments by @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite ) , where the average current @xmath436 and the zero - frequency current noise power @xmath330 generated in an aharonov - bohm ring were investigated as a function of an applied dc voltage @xmath437 , and magnetic field @xmath438 . in the nonlinear response regime , the current and noise power may be expressed as power series of the applied voltage : @xmath439 where the coefficients depend on the applied magnetic field @xmath440 . the steady state fluctuation theorem , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ssft ] ) , then predicts the following fluctuation relations @xcite @xmath441 where @xmath442 , @xmath443 , and analogous definitions for @xmath444 and @xmath445 .",
    "the first equation in ( [ eq : s012 ] ) is the johnson - nyquist relation @xcite . in the experiment by @xcite good quantitative agreement with the first and the third expressions in ( [ eq : s012 ] ) was established , whereas , for the time being , only qualitative agreement was found with the second relation .",
    "the higher order static fluctuation dissipation relations ( [ eq : s012 ] ) were obtained from a steady state fluctuation theorem for particle exchange under the simplifying assumption that no heat exchange occurs @xcite .",
    "then the probability of transferring @xmath8 particles is related to the probability of the reverse transfer by @xmath446 where @xmath447 is the so - called affinity . if both sides are multiplied by @xmath8 and integrated over @xmath8 a comparison of equal powers of applied voltage @xmath437 yields eq .",
    "( [ eq : s012 ] ) @xcite . an alternative approach , that also allows to include the effect of heat conduction , is offered by the fluctuation theorems for currents in open quantum systems .",
    "this objective has been put forward by @xcite and also by @xcite , based on a generating function approach in the spirit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : q - j - gen - functional - identity ] ) .",
    "in closing this colloquium we stress that the known fluctuation relations are based on two facts : ( a ) microreversibility for non - autonomous hamiltonian systems eq .",
    "( [ eq : q - microreversibility ] ) , and ( b ) the special nature of the initial equilibrium states which is expressible in either micro - canonical , canonical or grand - canonical form , or products thereof .",
    "the final state reached at the end of a protocol though is in no way restricted .",
    "it evolves from the initial state according to the governing dynamical laws under a prescribed protocol . in general",
    "this final state may markedly differ from any kind of equilibrium state .    for quantum mechanical systems",
    "it also is of utmost importance to correctly identify the work performed on a system as the difference between the energy of the system at the end and the beginning of the protocol . in case of open systems the difference of the energies of the total system at the end and beginning of the protocol",
    "coincides with the work done on the open system as long as the forces exclusively act on this open system . with the free energy of an open system determined as the difference of free energies of the total system and that of the isolated environment the quantum and classical jarzynski equality and the tasaki - crooks theorem continue to hold true even for systems strongly interacting with their environment .",
    "deviations from the fluctuation relations however must be expected if protocol forces not only act on the system alone but as well directly on the environmental degrees of freedom ; for example , if a time - dependent system - bath interaction protocol is applied .",
    "the most general and compact formulation of quantum work fluctuation relations also containing the onsager - casimir reciprocity relations and nonlinear response to all orders , is the andrieux - gaspard relation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : q - j - gen - functional - identity ] ) which represents the proper quantum version of the classical bochkov - kuzovlev formula @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bk - gen - functional - identity ] ) .",
    "these relations provide a complete theoretical understanding of those nonequilibrium situations that emerge from arbitrary time - dependent perturbations of equilibrium initial states .",
    "less understood are exchange fluctuation relations with their important applications to counting statistics @xcite .",
    "the theory there so far is restricted to situations where the initial state factorizes into grand - canonical states of reservoirs at different temperatures or chemical potentials .",
    "the interaction between these reservoirs is turned on and it is assumed that it will lead to a steady state within the duration of the protocol .",
    "experimentally , it is in general difficult to exactly follow this prescription and therefore a comparison of theory and experiment is only meaningful for the steady state .",
    "alternative derivations of exchange relations for more realistic , non - factorizing initial states would certainly be of much interest . in this context , the issue of deriving quantum fluctuation relations for open systems that initially are in nonequilibrium steady quantum transport states constitutes a most interesting challenge .",
    "likewise , from the theoretical point of view little is known thus far about quantum effects for transport in presence of time dependent reservoirs , for example using a varying temperature and/or chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "the experimental applications and validation schemes involving nonlinear quantum fluctuation relations still are in a state of infancy , as detailed with sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] , so that there is plenty of room for advancements . the major obstacle for the experimental verification of the work fluctuation relation is posed by the necessity of performing quantum projective measurements of energy .",
    "besides the proposal of @xcite employing trapped ions , we suggested here the scheme of a possible experiment employing circuit - qed architectures . in regard to exchange fluctuation relations instead",
    ", the main problem is related to the difficulty of measuring microscopic changes of macroscopic quantities pertaining to heat and matter reservoirs .",
    "continuous measurements of fluxes seemingly provide a practical and efficient loophole for this dilemma @xcite .",
    "the idea that useful work may be obtained by using information @xcite has established a connection between the topical fields of quantum information theory @xcite and quantum fluctuation relations . @xcite and @xcite used fluctuation relations and information theoretic measures to derive landauer s principle .",
    "a generalization of the jarzynski equality to the case of feedback controlled systems was provided in the classical case by @xcite , and in the quantum case by @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite gave bounds on the entropy production in terms of quantum information concepts .",
    "in similar spirit , @xcite presented a method by relating relative quantum entropy to the quantum jarzynski fluctuation identity in order to quantify multi - partite entanglement within different thermal quantum states .",
    "a practical application of the jarzynski equality in quantum computation was showed by @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
