    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we establish the existence of a solution to spde ( [ eq0623a ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] introduces the bdsde and gives a yamada ",
    "watanabe type criteria for such equation .",
    "it also illustrates the connection between the spde and the bdsde . as a consequence , uniqueness for the solution of the spde when the solutions are restricted to those with first order partial derivative in the spatial variable .",
    "we refine in section  [ sec4 ] the uniqueness proof of section  [ sec3 ] without the spatial differentiability condition .",
    "finally , section  [ sec5 ] applies the uniqueness result for spde ( [ eq0623a ] ) to three important measure - valued processes .",
    "we use @xmath97 or @xmath98 to denote the integral of a function @xmath25 with respect to the measure @xmath99 .",

    "@xmath101 is used to denote the partial derivative with respect to the variable @xmath47 if the notation @xmath102 is ambiguous .",
    "we conclude this section by mentioning other possible applications of the idea developed in this article .",
    "the first is to consider measure - valued processes with interaction among individuals in the system .",
    "this interaction may come from the drift and diffusion coefficients which govern the motion of the individuals .",
    "it may also come from the branching and immigration mechanisms .",
    "this extension will appear in a joint work of mytnik and xiong  @xcite .",
    "the second possible application is to consider other type of nonlinear spdes , especially those where the noise term involves the spatial derivative of the solution .",
    "this extension will appear in a joint work of gomez et al .",
    "finally , studying measure - valued processes by using spde methodology will have the advantage of utilizing the rich collection of tools developed in the area of spdes .",
    "for example , the large deviation principle ( ldp ) for some measure - valued processes , including fv process and the sbm , can be established .",
    "as is well known , ldp for general fv process is a long standing open problem ( some partial results were obtained by dawson and feng  @xcite , and feng and xiong  @xcite for neutral fv processes , and xiang and zhang  @xcite for the case when the mutation operator tends to 0 ) .",
    "this application will be presented in a joint work of fatheddin and xiong  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out to me by two referees and by leonid mytnik that theorem  [ thm0618a ] can be proved using the yamada ",
    "watanabe argument directly to the spde without introducing the bdsde .",
    "one of the advantages of the current backward framework is that the term involving the laplacian operator gets canceled when it  pardoux ",
    "peng formula is applied .",
    "furthermore , as one of the referees pointed out , `` it is quite possible that the bdsde idea will have something to offer in other natural interacting models . ''",
    "in fact , in  @xcite , the bdsde idea is used to get the uniqueness for the solution to an spde where the noise term involves the spatial derivative of the solution .",
    "this term actually helped us in the proof of the uniqueness of the solution . to the best of my knowledge , the direct yamada ",
    "watanabe argument to such an equation can not be easily implemented in this case .",
    "in this section , we consider the existence of a solution to spde ( [ eq0623a ] ) .",
