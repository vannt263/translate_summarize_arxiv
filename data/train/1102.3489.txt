    "jet quenching is one of the most informative probes for the formation of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) .",
    "it describes that partons produced in the initial collisions with high @xmath8 lose a large fraction of their energies when they propagate through the matter before the formation of final state hadrons .",
    "the experimental results of the suppression of both inclusive hadron @xcite and correlated away - side di - hadron yields @xcite were predicted from this energy loss @xcite .",
    "usually the energy loss of a jet is caused by two main mechanisms : elastic collisions with deconfined partons and induced gluon radiation . since the energy loss is related to the traverse path length of the jet @xcite , two - particle correlation is effective in investigating jet - medium interaction corresponding to the passage of a hard or semihard parton @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the correlation of @xmath0-@xmath0 in jets produced on near and away sides of high @xmath8 triggers has been studied in the frame work of the recombination model .",
    "now we consider the heavy - flavored meson yields and calculate the di - hadron correlation of @xmath0-@xmath1 in this paper .",
    "the elliptic flow which is a measure of the anisotropic momentum distribution of the produced particles is another important observable at rhic .",
    "the elliptical flow ( @xmath5 ) results from the initial geometrical anisotropy which creates pressure gradients soon after the start of the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "thus , the final @xmath5 is sensitive to the fireball evolution and allows us to probe the dynamical properties of the dense matter produced in the collisions .",
    "recently phenix collaboration has measured the @xmath1 elliptic flow parameter @xmath5 in au+au collisions at @xmath2 gev @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we calculate @xmath5 in the recombination model and compare our results with the experimental data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we calculate the di - hadron correlation of @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath5 of charmed mesons in section 2 and 3 , respectively . and a brief summary is given in the final section .",
    "based on the recombination model @xcite we have calculated the transverse momentum spectrum of @xmath1 which fits the experimental data well @xcite , and also have predicted @xmath8 spectra of other heavy flavored mesons for different centralities @xcite . in this section",
    "we apply the shower parton distributions ( spd ) to calculate the di - hadron correlation of @xmath0-@xmath1 on near and away sides .",
    "we use @xmath9 as a generic symbol for the transverse momentum of any hadron , @xmath10 for the trigger particle ( @xmath0 ) , @xmath11 for the associated particle ( @xmath1 ) on the near side and @xmath12 for the associated particle ( @xmath1 ) on the away side .    in the recombination model",
    "the meson production is expressed as the sum of three terms , @xmath13 ( pure thermal ) , @xmath14 ( thermal - shower ) and @xmath15 ( shower - shower ) , since there are two components of parton sources : thermal ( @xmath16 ) partons and shower ( @xmath17 ) partons which originate from hard partons .",
    "thus we have @xmath18    the shower - shower recombination term ( @xmath15 contribution ) is equivalent to the fragmentation function ( ff ) @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the distribution of hard parton @xmath21 in au+au collisions at @xmath2 gev after traversing the medium of length @xmath22 . the distribution @xmath23 of hard parton @xmath21 just after hard scattering at mid - rapidity can be found in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xmath24 is the explicit dynamical medium factor to describe the energy loss effect and its value for different centralities is determined by fitting the single - pion inclusive distribution @xcite .",
    "@xmath25 is the ff of parton @xmath21 splitting into meson @xmath26 and the results of ffs for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are obtained in ref.@xcite and refs.@xcite , respectively .    the thermal parton transverse momentum distribution density is given in ref.@xcite @xmath27 it s assumed that hadronization occurs at @xmath28 fm with temperature @xmath29 mev in the parton phase @xcite , which is consistent with predictions of the phase transition temperature at vanishing baryon chemical potential from lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "@xmath30 is the transverse area of the parton system with the radius @xmath31 fm @xcite . using the parameterized spd @xmath32 @xcite",
    ", we can determine the distribution of shower parton @xmath33 with transverse momentum @xmath34 in central au+au collisions as @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a little different from eq.([hardparton1 ] ) @xcite .",

    "@xmath41 in eq.([ts2 ] ) is the wave function of the meson in the momentum space .",
    "the wave functions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are determined in refs.@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 stand for the fugacities of the constituent quarks @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the fugacities of light quarks are @xmath46 , @xmath47 @xcite and for charm quark @xmath48 which is obtained by fitting the @xmath1 transverse momentum spectrum @xcite .",
    "since every quark has 3 color and 2 spin degrees of freedom , we use the meson degeneracy factor @xmath49 .",
    "we consider the di - hadron correlation at intermediate trigger momentum ( @xmath3 gev ) , thus approximately the @xmath13 contribution to the trigger and jet can be neglected .",
    "then the correlation of the particle @xmath1 with @xmath11 associated with the trigger particle @xmath0 with @xmath10 on the near side is @xmath50 \\widehat{ts}^{j/\\psi}(q - p_t , p_a)\\nonumber\\\\ &   & + \\widehat{ts}^{\\pi}(q - p_a , p_t)\\frac{1}{p^0_aq}d^{j/\\psi}_{i}(\\frac{p_a}{q } ) + \\frac{1}{p^0_tp^0_aq^2}d_2(\\frac{p_t}{q},\\frac{p_a}{q})\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the di - hadron ff @xmath51 is assumed as @xcite @xmath52.\\ ] ] the di - hadron distribution of the trigger @xmath0 and the associated @xmath1 with @xmath12 on the away side is calculated in ref.@xcite as @xmath53\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times[\\widehat{ts}^{j/\\psi}(q',p_b)+\\frac{1}{p^0_bq'}d^{j/\\psi}_{i}(\\frac{p_b}{q'})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath54 . here",
    ", @xmath55 is the momentum of the recoil parton in the trigger jet .    then the near - side ( away - side ) yield per trigger for the trigger momentum in a narrow range @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) around @xmath10 is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the trigger pion distribution that excludes the @xmath13 component of the inclusive distribution .",
    "we use @xmath4 to denote the centrality , for example , @xmath60 stands for 0 - 10@xmath61 centrality .",
    "the energy loss factor @xmath24 is dependent on @xmath4 and its values can be found in ref.@xcite . with the known parameters of @xmath24 we can calculate the yields for different centralities .",
    "the results of the yield of @xmath1 on near and away sides per trigger with three values of trigger @xmath0 transverse momentum @xmath10 in au+au collisions for 0 - 10@xmath61 and 40 - 50@xmath61 centralities at @xmath2 gev/@xmath4 are shown in fig.[near ] and fig.[away ] , respectively .",
    "for the central collisions ( @xmath60 ) , the near - side yield increases with @xmath10 for @xmath62 gev/@xmath4 , while this trend is reversed in the region of low @xmath11 .",
    "the away - side yield becomes higher as @xmath10 increases .",
    "we find that the shape of the @xmath11 distribution does not change with the centrality , while the trend of the away - side yield becomes smoother and similar to that of the near - side in more peripheral collisions .    in order to clarify the dependence of the yield on the centrality",
    ", the near - side yield versus @xmath4 is shown in fig.[nearl ] for @xmath63 and 6 gev/@xmath4 and @xmath64 and 6 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the result is nearly a constant in @xmath4 , which has been testified in ref.@xcite .",
    "the calculation of the average distance @xmath65 the parton travels to reach the near - side surface @xcite suggests that the hard scattering point is in a layer roughly 13@xmath61 of the medium size @xmath22 inside the surface and is insensitive to @xmath22 . on average 15@xmath61 of the parton energy",
    "is lost to the medium , which is also independent on @xmath22 .",
    "thus the centrality dependence of the near - side yield is negligible .",
    "the away - side yield increases when @xmath4 is raised from 0.05 to 0.75 for @xmath66 gev/@xmath4 as shown in fig.[awayl ] .",
    "it has been explained in ref.@xcite when a particle on the away side is required , the scattering point can not to be too far from the surface of the away side and the point is pulled closer to the surface with higher @xmath4 .",
    "so when the nuclear overlap is smaller , it is easier for the recoil jet to reach the away side to produce a particle .",
    "the calculation of the ratio of recoil parton average momentum @xmath67 in ref.@xcite also suggests that the energy loss of the recoil parton becomes smaller with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "that means in higher @xmath4 collisions the recoil parton emerges at the away - side surface with a larger momentum @xmath55 at given initial momentum @xmath68 .",
    "then , at low @xmath12 this leads to a visible smaller momentum fraction @xmath69 in eq.([awaydist ] ) .",
    "the ffs shown in ref.@xcite reflect that the probability of @xmath1 produced at low @xmath70 is very small , which results in the lower yield accordingly .",
    "thus the behavior of the dependence on the centrality is quite different in the region of low @xmath12 .",
    "the difference between @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation calculated in ref.@xcite is caused by the significantly different ffs for @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "one can take a clear comparison of the ffs in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "it s necessary to note that in ref.@xcite the shower partons can be initiated by hard partons @xmath71 and gluon .",
    "thus in @xmath0-@xmath0 calculation the ffs for pion come from three terms @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 denote the valence quark , @xmath76 the sea quark and @xmath77 the gluon . in @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation",
    "most contributions are from terms in which @xmath21 can be @xmath4 and @xmath77 since the ffs of light quarks splitting into @xmath1 are assumed to be zero in ref.@xcite .",
    "the ff @xmath78 increases up to the momentum fraction @xmath79 ( @xmath80 for @xmath81 ) and then decreases , while ffs for @xmath0 decrease monotonically with @xmath70 .",
    "it means that the probability of a parton splitting into @xmath0 is much higher at low @xmath70 but for @xmath1 the larger probability takes place at intermediate @xmath70 .",
    "this contrary trend of ffs at low @xmath70 results in the different behavior of the near - side yield between @xmath0-@xmath0 and @xmath0-@xmath1 for @xmath82 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "this difference also affects the away - side yield at low @xmath12 when @xmath4 increases with smaller @xmath24 , which is shown in the lower panel of fig.[away ] .",
    "the yield for @xmath0-@xmath1 is @xmath83 orders of magnitude lower than that of @xmath0-@xmath0 since the ffs for @xmath1 are much smaller than those for @xmath0 and the hard parton distribution of @xmath4 is about 3 orders lower than those of light quarks .",
    "what we have calculated is the transverse momentum spectra @xmath84 of @xmath0 and @xmath1 averaged over all azimuthal angle @xmath85 .",
    "because of the average over @xmath85 in the spectra , only the effective traversing length @xmath24 appears in the calculations for the medium effect . in the next section",
    ", we consider the azimuthal anisotropy in the spectra of charmed mesons and discuss the elliptic flow parameter .",
    "we discuss the azimuthal anisotropy of charmed meson momentum distribution by considering the elliptic flow @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the distribution of thermal parton is isotropic so that the recombination of @xmath13 is independent of azimuthal angle ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "then the @xmath85 dependence comes from the degraded hard parton distribution , which is caused by the dependence of the traversing length in the medium .",
    "both @xmath14 and @xmath15 components are proportional to the distribution of the hard partons .",
    "thus we can rewrite the meson production ( eq.([production ] ) ) as @xmath86+\\frac{dn^{\\mathcal{tt}}}{pdp},\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the probability of a hard parton @xmath21 with momentum @xmath88 at azimuthal angle @xmath85 in au+au collisions with centrality @xmath4 at @xmath2 gev .    for a hard parton created with the distribution @xmath89 at the creation point , the initial momentum @xmath90 changes into @xmath88 after traversing an absorptive distance @xmath91 .",
    "the corresponding distribution is expressed by the momentum degradation factor @xmath92 @xmath93 in terms of @xmath91 , @xmath92 can be written as a simple exponential form @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath95 is the probability of having a dynamical path length @xmath91 for a parton directed at @xmath85 , the hard parton distribution is obtained after carrying out the integration over @xmath91 @xmath96 in ref.@xcite , a scaling behavior of @xmath95 is found for the dependencies on @xmath85 and @xmath4 for pion production .",
    "@xmath95 can be written as a universal function in terms of a scaling variable @xmath97 @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the mean dynamical length .",
    "the scaling function is parameterized by @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the beta function .",
    "we can get the results of the average dynamical path length @xmath99 as a function of @xmath85 and @xmath4 in ref.@xcite",
    ".    the elliptic flow is quantified by the second fourier coefficient @xmath5 of the meson azimuthal distribution @xmath104.\\ ] ] then we can get the elliptic flow parameter @xmath5 of charmed mesons ( @xmath1 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) dependent on transverse momentum for different centralities .",
    "the results of @xmath1 @xmath5 for different centralities are exhibited in fig.[jpsiv2 ] with the experimental data from phenix collaboration @xcite .",
    "the calculated results are in agreement with the data within errors except the negative point at @xmath105 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 increases monotonically up to @xmath106 gev/@xmath4 and then starts to saturate to constants @xmath107 from @xmath108 , depending on the centrality . and",
    "the values of @xmath5 get larger from @xmath109 centralities at given @xmath8 .",
    "the trend of @xmath8 and centrality dependencies of @xmath5 is similar to that of other charge hadrons shown by phenix in ref.@xcite .",
    "we also predict @xmath5 of @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the results for @xmath6 are shown in fig.[comparev2 ] and the comparison of @xmath5 for the three different charmed mesons at @xmath60 is exhibited in the lower panel .",
    "obviously , @xmath5 of @xmath6 or @xmath7 is much larger than that of @xmath1 .",
    "this feature results from the different constituent quark mass in the three mesons .",
    "the dependence of momentum distribution on @xmath85 in eq.([phi ] ) comes from two terms @xmath14 and @xmath15 with the hard parton distribution @xmath110 .",
    "the thermal parton distribution of light quarks ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath76 ) is much higher than that of heavy quark @xcite .",
    "thus , for @xmath6 the main contribution to @xmath14 comes from @xmath113 .",
    "and its transverse momentum is mainly from that of the charm quark .",
    "roughly one can take @xmath114 . for @xmath1",
    ", since its two constituent quarks have the same mass , the transverse momentum for both @xmath4 and @xmath115 in @xmath1 are the same as half of that of @xmath1 . thus one would expect that @xmath116 . and @xmath117 is shown in the lower panel of fig.[comparev2 ] by the dashed line with symbols . @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 is almost the same and larger than that of @xmath1 at the same @xmath8 .",
    "the number of quark ( nq ) scaling of @xmath5 , @xmath118 versus @xmath119 , has been observed at rhic @xcite .",

    "quark coalescence model has been used to explain the flavor dependence of @xmath5 @xcite . in this model hadrons",
    "are combined by the coalescing quarks and then @xmath5 of hadrons can be expressed in terms of @xmath5 of quarks , where there are no difference in collectivity among @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath76 quarks .",
    "such a scaling implies that the momentum of the hadron is simply the sum of the momentum of the coalescing quarks . in our model",
    "the momentum of @xmath6 or @xmath7 comes mainly form charm quark due to the unequal constituent quark masses @xmath120 .",
    "thus we get different @xmath5 for @xmath1 and @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "our prediction can be tested by further experiments .",
    "if the experimental data get the larger value of @xmath5 for @xmath6 as we have expected , it offers a good proof for the success of the recombination model .",
