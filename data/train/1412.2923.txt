    "in simplex networks , where @xmath21 , the uniform state may undergo a turing instability as the ratio @xmath22 increases and exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "the instability leads to the spontaneous emergence of stationary patterns consisting of nodes with high or low densities of activators @xcite .",
    "such diffusion - induced instability can also take place in multiplex reaction networks  ( [ eq : rdnet ] ) .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained through a linear stability analysis with non - uniform perturbations .",
    "we introduce small perturbations , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , to the uniform steady state , as follows : @xmath25 .",
    "we then substitute the perturbed state into equations to obtain a set of coupled linearized differential equations .",
    "finally , by means of an approximation technique described fully in the methods section , we obtain a characteristic equation for the growth rate @xmath26 of the perturbations for each pair of nodes .",

    "condition  ( [ eq : turing_instability ] ) implies that a sufficiently large value of @xmath33 brings about instability , in the same manner as the turing instability .",
    "however , an alternative scenario of the instability is revealed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : turing_instability ] ) .",
    "this can happen by increasing @xmath29 , even if the mobilities are equal ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this instability occurs in a strikingly different regime from classical diffusion - induced instabilities .",
    "figure [ fig2]a shows the linear stability of system for varying @xmath29 , holding @xmath28 fixed .",
    "we clearly see that the uniform steady state is always a solution of the multiplex system .",
    "it is linearly stable ( green line ) for small values of @xmath29 .",
    "but at some critical value of @xmath29 which satisfies equation , the system undergoes a transcritical bifurcation ( red point ) and becomes unstable ( magenta line ) .",
    "two new branches of solutions arise from the transcritical bifurcation .",
    "the unstable branch ( magenta line ) undergoes a second bifurcation ( blue point ) , this time a saddle - node , giving rise to a new branch of stable solutions ( green line ) different from the uniform steady state .",
    "figure [ fig2]b shows the transcritical ( red line ) and the saddle - node bifurcation ( blue line ) in the @xmath29-@xmath28 plane .",
    "the curve of the transcritical bifurcation is given by equation , while the curve of the saddle - node bifurcation has been derived by numerical continuation .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : turing_instability ] ) that by increasing @xmath29 , the boundary curve ( red line ) asymptotically approaches @xmath35 .",
    "this indicates that the instability can be observed with sufficiently large @xmath29 , if the mean degree of the activator layer is less than this value .",
    "this fact reveals an important difference from the classical turing instability , which always takes place by increasing @xmath15 irrespective of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the diffusion - induced instability occurs on the transcritical bifurcation .",
    "however , non - uniform patterns can also develop after the saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "in other words , we find that multiplex systems exhibit multistability in the area between these two bifurcations ( cyan ) , where a branch of stable solutions coexists with the uniform steady state .",
    "suppose that the multiplex system starts almost in the uniform steady state with small perturbations .",
    "equation allows us to identify pairs of nodes ( @xmath4 , @xmath3 ) where the small perturbations will be amplified , so that these nodes leave the uniform state , triggering the formation of a non - uniform stationary pattern .",
    "such a pattern can not develop from pairs of nodes possessing degrees in the grey area of figure [ fig2]b , where only the uniform state exists .",
    "however , pairs of nodes with degrees in the yellow area , beyond the transcritical bifurcation , are unstable . under small perturbations",
    "they can leave the uniform state , yielding the formation of a stationary non - uniform pattern .",
    "the cyan area between the two bifurcations indicates that the system exhibits multistability , where the uniform steady state coexists with a branch of solutions corresponding to non - uniform patterns .",
    "we verify this scenario for a multiplex network where both layers , @xmath6 and @xmath5 , are scale - free .",
    "figure [ fig3]a displays the actual degree combination ( @xmath29 , @xmath28 ) for each pair of nodes @xmath4 , @xmath3 ( orange points ) of this network in the @xmath29-@xmath28 plane , together with the bifurcation curves .",
    "three pairs of nodes , the critical ones , denoted by stars , have degrees exceeding the instability threshold .",
    "thus , a non - uniform pattern starts to grow from these nodes .",
    "the critical node denoted by the red star is the first to spontaneously leave the uniform state , as shown in figure [ fig3]b .",
    "next , figures [ fig3]c , d show that the critical nodes denoted by the green and blue stars rapidly differentiate from the uniform state .",

    "each point of the diagram is the average of ten different implementations of @xmath6 with the same mean degree @xmath38 ; @xmath5 is fixed .",
    "we clearly see that the amplitude is zero ; _",
    "i.e. _ , the uniform state is the only stable attractor of the system , for @xmath40 smaller than a critical threshold @xmath41 .",
    "however , a more detailed look in the vicinity of this transition reveals that a number of different stationary patterns could be identified for the same parameter values . as an example ,",
    "figure  [ fig4]b shows the amplitudes in three simulations where different perturbations have been applied to the same sequence of multiplex networks .",
    "starting from the uniform state with small perturbations , the instability occurs at some critical threshold , resulting in a small abrupt increase of amplitude .",
    "different perturbations result in different values for the instability threshold .        obviously , different @xmath40 values lead to patterns of different amplitudes .",
    "figure [ fig3]e shows a pattern for @xmath42 , close to the transition .",
    "however , patterns where more nodes leave the uniform state can also develop far from the transition .",
    "figures [ fig5]a - f show the evolution of small perturbations in the uniform state and the formation of a non - uniform pattern in a multiplex network with scale - free layers of @xmath43 nodes , and mean degrees @xmath44 and @xmath45 . under the influence of small perturbations , some critical nodes differentiate rapidly from the uniform steady state .",
    "afterwards , nonlinear effects ( which are not described by our theory ) drive the multiplex system to self - organize into a stationary pattern with two separate group of nodes . the separation between nodes of low and high activator densities",
    "is more pronounced in nodes with small degrees @xmath28 , while nodes with large @xmath28 tend to sustain their initial state .",
    "figures [ fig6]a , b show this pattern in the activator and inhibitor layers respectively , whereas figure [ fig6]c shows the actual multiplex pattern .",
    "we have proposed a new class of dynamical systems , multiplex reaction networks , where each reacting species occupies its own network layer and reacts with the other species using cross - layer contacts . as a demonstration of this new reaction scheme , we investigate pattern formation induced by diffusive transport in a multiplex network with two reacting species .",
    "our theory , based on linear stability analysis with perturbations around the uniform steady state , correctly predicts the instability threshold observed in numerical simulations of the multiplex network .",
    "if the different layers have the same architecture , _ i.e. _ @xmath46 , then this multiplex diffusion - induced instability reduces to the well - known turing instability which may occur when the inhibitor diffuses much faster than the activator .",
    "our theory  ( [ eq : turing_instability ] ) predicts that the analogous instability can also appear in multiplex reaction networks by increasing the inhibitor diffusion rate .",
    "however , a significantly different kind of instability can occur in multiplex reaction networks , even if the two species have the same mobilities ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this new instability is related to the degree combination ( @xmath29 , @xmath28 ) of a pair of nodes .",
    "the basic condition for any given pair of nodes @xmath4 , @xmath3 to undergo instability is that their degrees @xmath29 and @xmath28 satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : turing_instability ] ) . indeed , the instability always takes place for any @xmath28 which is less or equal to the value calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : turing_instability ] ) , for a given large @xmath29 .",
    "similar to simplex networks , multiplex systems exhibit multistability .",
    "the onset of pattern formation can occur even before the instability described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : turing_instability ] ) .",
    "the minimal condition for developing non - uniform patterns is that in a pair of nodes @xmath4 , @xmath3 the degree @xmath28 is less than or equal to the value on the saddle - node bifurcation curve that corresponds to @xmath29 . in the multistability regime ,",
    "different stationary patterns can coexist with the uniform steady state for the same parameter values .",
    "although the observed properties of the stationary patterns are similar to those found in simplex networks @xcite , the cause of destabilization of the uniform state is different .",
    "this cause is only characteristic of multiplex networks and lies in the relationship between @xmath29 and @xmath28 for a pair of nodes .",
    "therefore , the purposeful design of nonequilibrium patterns should be possible by tuning the architecture of the multiplex structure . recently ,",
    "new algorithms for building multiplex networks with positive or negative degree correlations across the layers have been proposed @xcite . using these algorithms",
    ", we can design multiplex networks where the onset of instability is controlled by tuning the degrees @xmath29 and @xmath28 , and the source of instability can be located at any desired pair of nodes @xmath4 , @xmath3 .",
    "multiplex networks can be used to represent different types of interaction @xcite or different transportation lines @xcite between discrete nodes . in ecological multiplex networks , for example , pairs of nodes might represent separate habitat patches which communicate through dispersal connections .",
    "however , prey and predators may use different connections ( such as forest paths , rivers and tributaries or various transportation systems ) to move among the fragmented habitats .",
    "often , predators have more choices to move ; in our representation their layer is more densely connected than the prey s layer .",
    "this is exactly the sort of situation that favors the formation of instability and the subsequent establishment of non - uniform patterns . considering that self - organized patterns can be found in real ecosystems @xcite it is possible that such patterns can also be observed in natural ecological systems for which the multiplex structure is innate .",
