    "it is an admitted fact that the accelerated expansion of our universe and the existence of dark matter are two such important aspects of modern cosmology that have been accepted on the background of observational data ( riess ( 2007 ) , perlmutter ( 1999 ) , hanany ( 2000 ) , peebles and ratra ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "these finding have imposed some additional challenges to theories of gravitation . the most significant way to explain",
    "the observational data is by admitting that the einstein theory of gravitation breaks down at large scales , and a more generalized form of action is required to describe the gravitational field at large scales . during the last decades the most general theoretical models of @xmath4 gravity , where @xmath1 being ricci scalar , have been extensively used to explain the cosmological results .",
    "the accelerated expansion of universe and the conditions for the presence of dark energy have been have studied in @xmath4 gravity ( padmanabhan ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "the physical conditions for the viable cosmological models have been found in @xmath4 ( nojiri and odintsov ( 2011 ) , bamba et al(2012 ) , and satisfy the weak field limit obtained from the classical tests of general relativity .",
    "the @xmath4 models that satisfy the solar system tests of general relativity and provides the unification of inflation and dark energy were investigated in ( nojiri and odintsov ( 2007 ) , cognola et al , ( 2008 ) ) . in @xmath4 gravity",
    ", it has been proved that the galactic dynamic of massive test particles can be explained by excluding the possibility of dark matter ( [ capozziello et al ( 2006 ) , borowiec et al ( 2007 ) , martins and salucci ( 2007 ) , boehmer et al , ( 2008 ) ) .",
    "further , investigations in @xmath4 gravity can be found in detail in ( [ sotiriou and faraoni ( 2010 ) lobo ( 2008 ) , capozziello and v. faraoni ( 2010 ) ) .",
    "a most general form of @xmath4 theory of gravity was proposed in ( bertolami et al ( 2007 ) ) , by including an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath1 with the matter lagrangian density @xmath5 in the action of the theory . as a consequence of such modification",
    "the motion of massive particles is non - geodesic and there exists an extra - force the astronomical implication of non - minimal matter - geometry coupling were explored in ( nojiri and odintsov ( 2004 ) , harko ( 2010 ) ) and palatini approach of non - minimal geometry - coupling models was discussed in ( harko and lobo ( 2010 ) ) . in this coupling , a maximal extension of the hilbert - einstein action",
    "was performed in ( koivisto ( 2006 ) ) by taking the gravitational lagrangian as an arbitrary function of ricci scalar @xmath1 and matter lagrangian density @xmath5 .",
    "the field equations as well as the equations of motion for test particles have been formulated in the metric formalism , which is the covariant divergence of the stress - energy tensor",
    ". a specific form of above coupling was considered as another extension of general relativity as @xmath0 , modified theories of gravity , where action is given by an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath1 and trace of the stress - energy tensor @xmath2 ( nesseris ( 2009 ) ) .",
    "firstly , lobo , et .",
    "( harko et al(2011 ) ) introduced such modifications to obtain some specific results of cosmology , the more general aspects such as reconstruction of cosmological models and late time acceleration of universe was first studied in ( houndjo ( 2012 ) ) .",
    "further , the energy conditions and thermodynamics in @xmath0 , theories have been investigated by sharif and zubair ( sharif and zubair ( 2012 ) , sharif , m. and zubair ( 2012 ) ) .    in general conformal killing vectors ( ckvs)explain the mathematical relation between the geometry and contents of matter in the spacetime via einstein set of field equations .",
    "the ckvs are used generate the exact solution of the einstein field equation in more convenient form as compared to other analytical approaches .",
    "further these are used to discover the conservation laws in any spacetime .",
    "the einstein field equations being the highly non - linear partial differential equations can be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations by using ckvs .",
    "a lot of astrophysical phenomena have been explored on the theoretical background using the ckvs approach ( see ( ray et al ( 2008 ) , rahaman et al ( 2014 ) , rahaman et al ( 2015a , b , c ) ) .",
    "the interior anisotropic fluid spheres admitting conformal motion have been studied during the last stages by herrera and his collaborators ( herrera ( 1992 ) herrera et al ( 1984 ) , herrera and ponce de leon ( 1985 ) herrera and ponce de leon ( 1985a , b ) ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "our main motivation is to find the exact solution for static anisotropic spheres preserving the conformal motion in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "section * 2 * deals with formulation of field equations in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the exact solutions with isotropic and anisotropic configurations have been investigated in section * 3*. the last section summaries the results of the paper .",
    "the modified action in @xmath0 is as follows @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is matter lagrangian and @xmath8 denote the metric tensor . different choices of @xmath7 can be considered , each of which directs to a specific form of fluid .",
    "the line element for general spherically symmetric metric describing the compact star stellar configuration is @xmath9    taking @xmath10 and upon variation of modified eh action in @xmath0 ( [ 1 ] ) with respect to metric tensor @xmath11 , the following modified field equations are formed as @xmath12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 denotes the usual matter energy momentum tensor that is considered to be anisotropic , is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote energy density , radial and transverse stresses respectively .",
    "the four velocity is denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 to be the radial four vector satisfying @xmath20 the conformal killing vector is defined through the relation @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the lie derivative of metric tensor and @xmath23 is the conformal vector .    using eq.([2 ] ) in ( [ 6 ] ) , one can find @xcite @xmath24 these results imply @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are integration constants .",
    "when @xmath28 , the expression for @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be extracted from modified field equations as follows @xmath29 here @xmath30 and prime denotes the derivatives with respect to radial coordinate .",
    "eqs.([8])-([10 ] ) are highly non - linear to find the @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , we consider the simples case @xmath32 which represents the @xmath33cdm model in @xmath0 gravity . for this choice we can find the results for @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the following form @xmath34",
    "now we are seeking solutions for two different physical situations . at first , we assume the isotropic case and secondly we will consider anisotropic model of the fluid sphere .      for isotropic model of the fluid sphere , it is assumed that @xmath35 .    using the isotropic pressures and solving the equations ( [ 11])-([13 ] ) , we get @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an arbitrary constant .    to search the physical properties of the interior of the fluid sphere , we draw the profile of matter density and pressure in fig.*1*(left ) and fig.*1 * ( midle ) respectively .",
    "the profile indicates that matter density and pressure all are positive inside the fluid sphere .",
    "it is to be noted that density and radial pressure are decreasing with the radial coordinate @xmath38 which are the common features .",
    "obviously all energy conditions are satisfied see fig.*1 * ( right ) .",

    "this work can be extended by taking more general form of the @xmath0 gravity model , to discuss some other physical properties like anisotropic parameter @xmath54 , optimality of density and pressure and surface red - shift .",
