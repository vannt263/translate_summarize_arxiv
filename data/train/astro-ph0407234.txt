    "there are many properties of elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges ( systems which are , at a given luminosity , essentially identical ) that have been difficult to understand .",
    "these are the observed regularities with regard to metallicity , gas content , etc . , which have largely been accepted as given .",
    "now , we have discovered ( cf .",
    "tremaine   2002 ) an important new fact , the apparently universal presence ( and mass ) of the central black holes ( ` bhs ' ) , that may provide the key to understanding these other properties .",
    "the masses of the central bhs are known to be tightly correlated with the velocity dispersions of the spheroidal components ( e.g. , gebhardt   2000 , merritt & ferrarese 2001 , tremaine   2002 ) , or , alternatively , with the luminosity of those components ( cf .",
    "magorrian   1998 , kormendy 2000 ) .",
    "since , for each bh the radiant energy emitted in accumulating the corresponding mass is known via the soltan argument ( 1982 ) , and the efficiency is also known to within @xmath0 to be 0.1 ( cf .",
    "yu & tremaine 2002 ) , close to the maximum permitted , and finally , we know the typical emitted spectrum of an agn ( cf .",
    "sazonov , ostriker & sunyaev 2004 ) , we thus know to moderate precision the detailed properties of the electromagnetic radiation seen by a given atom at some place in the galaxy .",
    "of course it is possible that the black hole now seen in a given galaxy has been added at a late time ( or a significant fraction of its mass has been accreted via in - falling bhs ) , but that does not change the overall situation significantly , since the in - falling bh ( given the observed scaling relations ) was central to another scaled model of the currently observed spheroidal system ( see also ciotti & van albada 2001 for a discussion of this last point ) . the purpose of this presentation is to show that this radiation will , via standard physical processes , tend to heat and expel the metal - rich gas ( ` feedback ' in currently fashionable jargon ) in a way that will match the observed properties of elliptical galaxies with regard to the amount and metallicity of the gas within them and the gas expelled by them .",
    "it will also help to explain the observed shut - off of star formation in these systems at a fairly early epoch , and the observed limitation on the mass of central black holes .",
    "all of these conclusions are preliminary and suggestive , but the overall logic seems persuasive . before proceeding , we would like to thank our co - workers , s. sazonov and r. sunyaev whose contributions have been essential ( cf . also sazonov   2004 ) .",
    "finally we should note that the radiant output is not the only , nor even necessarily the dominant mechanism whereby feedback from accretion onto central black holes can heat gas in elliptical galaxies .",
    "binney & tabor ( 1995 ) have stressed that the mechanical energy input from radio jets will also provide a significant source of energy , and much detailed work has been performed to follow up this suggestion .",
    "it is not obvious that all agns produce radio jets , whereas all do appear to produce high energy radiation . in any case , the two mechanisms are complementary , and in this paper we are exploring only the radiative feedback , which may be supplemented by ( or dominated by in some cases ) , the mechanical energy input .",
    "there are two essential points to be made .",
    "the first is well - known : elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges form , to good accuracy , a one parameter sequence . while a treatment in terms of two parameters via the ` fundamental plane ' is slightly more accurate , a single parameter , the velocity dispersion of the stars within the half - light radius , @xmath1 , provides an excellent predictor of the optical luminosity , the color , the metallicity , the half - light radius , and now the mass of the central black hole .",
    "the papers of kormendy over the years ( e.g. , kormendy 1977 et seq . ) provide the best introduction to this primal , galactic fact , which originated with the faber - jackson ( 1976 ) relation .",
    "meisels & ostriker ( 1984 ) elaborated on this fundamental relation to include also the effects of environment in helping to determine some aspects of the disc component seen in many systems .",
    "the second point is that this set of relations is most easily understood ( cf .",
    "for example dekel & silk 1986 ) in terms of a feedback process that terminates galactic stellar and chemical evolution in a fashion that correlates with @xmath1 , or , alternatively , with the circular velocity , @xmath2 , or with the central potential , @xmath3 , all of which are tightly correlated with one another .",
    "in general , elliptical components show a low ratio of gas - to - total mass , with tabulated values from well studied low red - shift examples typically showing of order 1% in gas ( cf .",
    "knapp , turner & cunniffe 1985 ) , and most of that is seen in x - rays and close to the virial temperatures of the systems ( @xmath4k ) .",
    "standard evolutionary calculations of a closed box model in which gas is converted to stars and constantly recycled with the metallicity increasing each generation ( cf . ostriker & tinsley 1975 ) predict that the gas - phase metallicity , @xmath5 , will increase as the gas fraction , @xmath6 , decreases :    @xmath7    here , @xmath8 is the ` yield ' and @xmath9 is the recycled stellar fraction , and the single parameter , @xmath10 is determined by a fit to the mean stellar metallicity .",
    "the measured metallicities of the gas @xmath11 since in fact @xmath12 , a significant amount of it has been expelled from the galaxies in question .",
    "this probably occurred when the ratio of gas - to - stars was of order 10% , and , since the gas phase metallicity is always close to twice the mean stellar metallicity , the total metals in the expelled gas was probably at least 20% of the metals in the stars .",
    "this argument is consistent with the fact that within clusters the total amount of metals in the intra - cluster gas ( presumably expelled from the galaxies ) is of the same order as the total amount locked up in stars ( renzini   1993 ) .",
    "thus the inferred evolution of the systems is that the initial complement of gas , plus any infalling and recycled gas from dying stars , was incorporated into successive generations of stars , with an approximately constant ratio of growing bh mass to stellar mass ( at 0.13% ) until the gas fraction was reduced to some level such that cooling could not keep up with heating ( to lowest order the first is quadratic in the density and the second is linear , so , all other things being equal , a transition will occur at some specific density determined by the radiation field ) .",
    "then , following the classic calculations of dalgarno & mccray ( 1972 ) , the gas undergoes a transition ( at constant pressure ) to a higher temperature , lower density phase .",
    "evidence for the constancy of the ratio of the accretion rate to the star formation rate can be found in haiman , ciotti & ostriker ( 2004 ) and heckman   ( 2004 ) . a detailed argument for the transition to the high temperature solution at @xmath13",
    "can be found in sazonov   ( 2004 ) .",
    "a considerable amount of gas will be expelled at this time and , subsequently , both star formation and black hole accretion will proceed at a much lower level , as determined by the availability of additional gas and the accretion and infall possible in the high temperature phase .",
    "a simple quantitative estimate is possible by noting that , if a mass roughly equal to 10% of the stellar mass was expelled , and the escape velocity is approximately @xmath14 , then the energy required to do this , in units of the total stellar mass , can be expressed as a feedback efficiency , @xmath15 : @xmath16 if , instead we consider that the source of the energy may have been the central bh , having a mass equal to @xmath17 , then we can rewrite ( 2.3 ) as @xmath18    now the bh has emitted radiant energy with an efficiency of @xmath19 , so only a fraction of the emitted energy @xmath20 is required to expel the gas . in sum , if approximately 0.5% of the radiant emission of the central agn can couple to the gas , this will suffice to expel the required amount .",
    "we will show later that this is exactly what is expected to occur , given the emitted spectrum and normal atomic processes . but first , let us note an argument , additional to the two mentioned so far ( which depend on the observed metallicity of the galaxy and the amount of cluster gas respectively ) , that indicates the likely importance of central feedback .",
    "there is a well - known ` cooling flow problem ' in clusters of galaxies : the time for a significant fraction of the centrally located gas to cool ( _ via _ the observed radiative output ) and to collapse is small compared to the age of these systems , smaller in comparison to the hubble time in ellipticals than in clusters . a source of energy",
    "must be found that can convincingly produce a balance between energy loss and gain ( fabian 2004 ) . in ellipticals",
    "the cooling times are typically @xmath21 years ( ciotti   1991 ) , significantly shorter than the billion - year timescale for intra - cluster gas .",
    "once again , the solution must be a source of energy , feedback , from the stellar or central bh energy sources .",
    "the energy requirements are comparable to those noted for expulsion of the gas earlier noted , and the observed rate of supernovae in such systems is quite capable of supplying the needed energy .",
    "however , it is not likely that snia provide the entire solution , because the distribution of the energy input ( parallel to the observed light profiles ) is not nearly concentrated enough to balance the observed gas cooling rates ( which , since they scale as @xmath22 , are required to be very large in the very central regions ) .",
    "moreover , the rate of snia is independent of the current thermal state of the x - ray emitting plasma , so sn heating can not act as a self - regulating mechanism .",
    "thus , a concentrated feedback source is well designed for this purpose , and the central bh is the natural candidate , by its mass and by its location through a combination of mechanical and radiative feedback mechanisms ( cf . binney & tabor 1995 , ciotti & ostriker 1997 , for a review see mathews & brighenti 2003 ) .",
    "let us now examine the situation in somewhat greater detail .",
    "the ` standard ' cooling flow model , even though observationally motivated and rich with testable predictions , nonetheless presents a few major unsolved problems when applied to elliptical galaxies . perhaps the most severe is the fate of the supposedly cooling material .",
    "in fact , in elliptical galaxies the mass return rate from the ( passively ) evolving stellar population is well known , and is of the order of @xmath23 solar masses per year , where @xmath24 is the galaxy blue luminosity in solar units ( ciotti   1991 ) .",
    "thus , a long lived cooling flow would accumulate mass in a central bh with mass substantially exceeding that currently observed .",
    "alternative forms of cold mass disposal , such as distributed mass drop - out / star formation , have been proved not viable solutions ( e.g. , binney 2001 ) .",
    "a solution to this problem was proposed by dercole   ( 1989 ) and ciotti   ( 1991 ) , by considering the effect of snia heating of the galactic gas , and exploring the time evolution of gas flows by using hydrodynamical numerical simulations .",
    "subsequent , more realistic galaxy models , also with the up - to date rates of snia ( as derived by direct counts from optical observations ) were explored by pellegrini & ciotti ( 1998 ) . basically , it was found that sn input sufficed for low and medium - luminosity elliptical galaxies to produce fast winds , but the more massive spheroids would still host inflow solutions similar to cooling flows .",
    "the physical reason for this behaviour is just the fact that , while the number of snia per unit luminosity is expected to be constant in all ellipticals , the gas binding energy per unit mass increases with galaxy luminosity .",
    "thus , feedback is still required for medium - large ellipticals or else they will experience significant mass accretion onto their central bh , producing masses much larger than those observed ( binney & tabor 1995 ) .",
    "the classical work on spherical accretion to a bh ( e.g. , shapiro 1973 ) assumed bondi accretion ( 1952 ) at large radii and looked for steady state solutions having a mass flow rate independent of radius .",
    "radiant losses from the accreting gas were included but energy gained when fluid elements absorb some of the radiation emitted by interior , energy losing regions was neglected .",
    "modifications to the classic work have either abandoned spherical symmetry , the assumption of a mass flow rate independent of radius , the assumption of a steady state or have allowed for energy gains as well as losses . while the inclusion of rotation certainly requires one to abandon spherical symmetry , the ` polish doughnut ' ( jaroszynski , abramowicz & paczynski 1980 ) , and other solutions which are physically thick are not , in essentials , very different from the corresponding spherical solutions .",
    "but the adaf ( narayan & yi 1994 ) and cdaf ( e.g. , quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) solutions , which are not mass conservative , are substantially different from the classical fixed mass flow solutions .",
    "the revisions required when one allows for radiant energy gains ( ` feedback ' again ) are still more substantial and typically preclude steady flow except in cases of very low luminosity ( compared to the eddington value ) . as an example of combining two of the modifications , park & ostriker ( 2001 ) showed that the standard adaf solution becomes physically inconsistent in the polar regions , because the slow infall near the pole allows the optically thin gas enough time to be heated by the radiation emitted from interior regions sufficiently to reverse the flow .",
    "thus adaf and cdaf flows would tend to develop evacuated , conical regions with intermittent winds likely emitted as unsteady jets ( cf .",
    "ryu   1995 and das   2001 for analogous solutions ) .",
    "turning to quasi - spherical flows , park & ostriker ( 1998 ) , summarizing the extant literature , noted that hot flows tend to become intermittent , due to preheating of the inflowing gas when the flow rate is within two orders of magnitude of the eddington limit ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) .",
    "more generally , the nature of the flow can be characterized by two dimensionless numbers : the luminosity in units of the eddington luminosity and the mass flow in the same units ( @xmath25 ) . for low values of both quantities ,",
    "the gas density is everywhere low , and both emission and absorption of radiation are negligible .",
    "the flow is essentially adiabatic .",
    "there exist self - consistent flows with high mass flow rates and low luminosity ; in these the gas cools at large distance from the black hole , and once on a low adiabat , it radiates inefficiently only a small fraction of its total kinetic energy but cools efficiently , losing a large fraction of its ( relatively small ) thermal energy .",
    "so the flow stays cool all the way to the horizon .",
    "there would be not much of an observational signature for such flows , so they may be more important than is now known in building up the mass of the central black holes .",
    "for relatively high values of the mass flow , there also exist high temperature solutions . in these cases ,",
    "radiation from the inflowing dense gas at small distances from the black hole is intense enough to heat the gas at large radii at a rate greater than it cools , so it stays on a high adiabat and hence , self - consistently , when it arrives near the black hole it is hot and dense and capable of emitting the radiation needed to maintain the hot flow .",
    "typically , these solutions are possible ( and in fact necessary ) whenever the luminosity is within two orders of magnitude of the eddington value .",
    "time dependent computations typically find that these solutions are unstable , since downward fluctuations in the luminosity lead to less preheating and thus lower luminosity  and _ vice versa_. a rapid flaring behaviour ensues .",
    "the overall average luminosity is set by the infall rate ( roughly determined by the bondi formulation at the accretion radius which is outside the flaring zone ) , so the luminosity cycles between the eddington value and a much lower value and results in a small duty cycle . on a longer timescale",
    "there can be heating of gas outside the accretion radius that will lower the accretion rate significantly and essentially shut off the accretion process until the gas in the bulk of the galaxy cools sufficiently to again begin accretion .",
    "figures 2 and 3 illustrate these two types of inflow of in a case with parameters chosen to represent typical accretion of a massive black hole in an elliptical galaxy ( ciotti & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the luminosity computed over a hubble time , while figure 3 shows a close - up of the first series of bursts , approximately 2.5 gyr from the onset .",
    "overall the duty cycle computed ( the fraction of the time that the agn is in the ` on ' state and radiating near the eddington limit ) is 0.006 , quite low and consistent with the fraction of low redshift elliptical galaxies which are seen in the active , quasar state . additionally , the distribution of x - ray luminosities seen above can be compared to that observed in a local sample of elliptical galaxies and is in good agreement . in contrast , if one did not allow for the feedback , not only would the duty cycle be far higher ( as nothing significantly would be impeding the accretion ) , but the typical luminosities would be higher than those seen .",
    "next we turn to the luminosity distribution ( taken at random time intervals ) of the x - ray emission from the hot gas in the galaxy .",
    "figure 4 shows that the agreement with the observed distribution of @xmath26 is good , much better than if we ignore feedback ( ` cooling flow ' model ) .",
    "finally , the resultant black hole masses are computed to be in the observed range . in the absence of the feedback ,",
    "the masses grow to values ( @xmath27 ) far higher than observed anywhere .",
    "in summary , if one allows the radiation emitted from the accreting black hole to interact with and heat the gas in the galaxy from which it is accreting , one solves the cooling flow problem in elliptical galaxies , and the feedback produces systems that typically look like normal ellipticals containing hot gas .",
    "they sometimes look like incipient cooling flows and rarely but importantly look like quasars . in the works quoted ( ciotti & ostriker 1997 , 2001 )",
    ", there was a major uncertainty in not knowing with any accuracy the typical qso spectrum , in particular the high energy component of that spectrum , which is most important for heating the ambient gas .",
    "thus , a simple broken power law was adopted for the spectrum with a range of possible values of the compton temperature  from @xmath28k to @xmath29k  with most of the emphasis of the paper being on the higher temperatures .",
    "subsequent work by sazonov , ostriker & sunyaev ( 2004 ) , which carefully assessed the full range of observational data from agns , concluded that the typical radiation temperature was narrowly bounded to values near @xmath30k , at the lower end of the range adopted by ciotti and ostriker , thus reducing the typical heating rate .",
    "however there is a rather large compensating effect also not included by ciotti and ostriker : gas heated by radiation with a characteristic temperature near @xmath31k is heated far more effectively by absorption in the atomic lines of the abundant metal species than by the compton process . with these two modifications , ciotti and ostriker have recomputed the evolution of an accreting black hole in elliptical galaxies .",
    "the detailed results will be presented in forthcoming papers and only a brief summary will be given here .",
    "two types of calculation were made .",
    "in one , labeled the ` toy model ' , we have allowed for a large number of relevant physical processes but treated the mathematics of accretion casually , by adopting a two - zone model and assuming bondi - like accretion . in the second , labeled ` hydrodynamic ' , we do a careful job with regard to spatially and temporally resolving the hydrodynamic flow problem ( shocks , radiative transfer and other details computed ) but neglecting physical complications such as star formation , cosmological inflow etc .      the adopted equations for the mass budget in the toy model are given below , with subsequent figures presenting some of the salient results .",
    "their full description is given in sazonov   ( 2004 ) , together with the energy equations ( not shown here ) .",
    "the gas budget for the galaxy ( equation [ 4.1 ] ) allows for cosmological infall ( equation [ 4.2 ] ) , star formation ( equation [ 4.3 ] ) , recycled gas from dying stars ( equation [ 4.4 ] ) , accretion onto the central black hole(s ) ( equations [ 4.6]-[4.7 ] ) , and possible galactic superwinds ( equation [ 4.8 ] ) .",
    "star formation follows the prescriptions made familiar by the semi - analytic models .",
    "seed black holes are assumed to be produced by the collapse of massive stars following normal stellar evolution .",
    "dynamical friction brings them to the center of the system where they are assumed to merge .",
    "@xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and the function @xmath37 is given in sazonov   ( 2004 ) .",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the bondi accretion rate .",
    "finally @xmath41 and @xmath42 otherwise",
    ".    overall , there are two phases , one in which star formation is the dominant process and the growing black holes have a negligible effect , and then later , after the gas reservoir is significantly depleted , the by now massive black holes heat and eject much of the remaining gas in co - operation with the remaining supernova induced heating . the first phase would be identified observationally with the lyman break galaxies .",
    "roughly 3% of these ( steidel   2002 ) show central agns , thus identifying the duty cycle at this time with roughly this level .",
    "such systems are in the stage of rapid star formation and show significant wind activity .",
    "the later , high gas temperature phase would be identified with normal , local ellipticals which contain little gas , have low rates of star formation and have a duty cycle ( fraction of time during which they appear as agns ) of roughly 0.1% .",
    "thus , in equation ( 4.7 ) the duty cycle factor is known empirically to be @xmath43 in the cold phase ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) , while @xmath45 in the hot phase ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) .",
    "we see , as expected , flaring during the cold flow stage of evolution , when star formation dominates , and then , when gas is depleted to a level of about 1% of the stellar mass , a transition to the hot solution , some outgassing of the galaxy and a decrease in the rate of growth of the black hole .",
    "overall , in the presented model about 80% of the growth of the central black holes is from accretion and about 20% from the merging of stellar seed black holes .",
    "next we turn to the results of the detailed hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "figure 8 shows the evolution of the gas mass and black hole mass , for a model similar to the reference model in ciotti & ostriker ( 2001 ) , calculated with the new heating function and the compton temperature as derived by sazonov   ( 2004 ) .",
    "the left panel of figure 9 shows the temperature and density in the central regions of the model : note how the qso bursts heat the central gas , causing the density to drop ; note also the compton temperature floor .",
    "the right panel shows the time evolution of the luminosity of the central black hole and of the coronal , x - ray emitting gaseous atmosphere of the galaxy .",
    "note how the qso luminosity is grouped in highly structured bursts .",
    "in particular , the x - ray luminosity of the galactic ism falls in the range of commonly observed in real galaxies , with mean values lower than the expected luminosity for a standard cooling - flow model ( see figure 10 ) .",
    "interesting aspects of the feedback process can be observed looking at the same data on expanded temporal scales , as shown in figures 1112 . in particular , it is apparent how the major bursts are organized in several bursts with shorter and shorter time - scales .",
    "thus , the complex flaring behaviour of the accretion shown by the detailed hydro simulations during the hot phase is superficially consistent with our knowledge of low redshift qsos in giant elliptical galaxies , but there are many details to be computed and compared to observations . as an example , in figure 13 we show four representative snapshots of the x - ray surface brightness of the galaxy before and after a major nuclear outburst .",
    "we now know the masses and radiative outputs of the black holes found in the centers of elliptical galaxies with some reasonable certainty , and it is clear that the em output should have had a powerful effect on the gas resident in these systems .",
    "detailed , but still uncertain calculations indicate that relaxation oscillations should be the normal state as energetic output from the central bh at near the eddington limit will tend to heat and expel the gas from the vicinity of the bh thus reducing further accretion until the gas can cool and the cycle can start again .",
    "there are various different time - scales associated with these relaxation oscillations depending on whether the heating is effective within or outside of the accretion radius .",
    "a small duty cycle is the natural outcome of this process in accord with the observational fact that most elliptical galaxies are not seen in the agn state .",
    "a corollary of this ( low average accretion rate ) is that the black hole mass growth is self limited to relatively low values consistent with the observed relations between bh mass and stellar mass in ellipticals .",
    "another corollary is that gas , being steadily pushed away from the dense inner part of the galaxy , radiates far less in the x - ray bands than it would otherwise do were there no feedback - again in accord with observations .",
    "finally , the qso luminosities are also computed to be within the observed range .",
    "what are the critical tests of this picture that can be proposed ?",
    "first , the feedback should produce an anti - correlation between the galaxy x - ray luminosity and the quasar luminosity : elliptical galaxies containing qsos should , on average , be less luminous in the x - rays from their hot gas than the systems with the same velocity dispersion but observed in an agn quiet phase .",
    "available data may allow one to test this prediction .",
    "second , we should occasionally find ellipticals in the phase after a series of bursts , when they contain a low density high temperature bubble in their central regions .",
    "do we observe this ?",
    "many further such tests can be proposed by the discerning reader , and the ones mentioned above may not , in fact , be usefully employable , but it is certain that we have now moved from wondering about the existence of massive black holes in the centers of galaxies to computing the consequences of these behemoths and searching for the observational results of the enormous energy output from them .",
    "in addition to the important input from our colleagues , m.g . park , s. pellegrini , s. sazonov and r. sunyaev , we are appreciative of the wise counsel received from j. binney , a. fabian , and m. rees ."
