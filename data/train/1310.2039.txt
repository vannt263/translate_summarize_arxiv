    "the relation between supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and their host galaxies is a major theme of current astrophysics .",
    "the scaling relations @xcite between the smbh mass @xmath0 and the velocity dispersion @xmath1 and mass @xmath2 of the host spheroid strongly suggest that the hole s enormous binding energy affects the host in important ways . a credible picture of this process is gradually emerging ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but we are still far from a deterministic theory of smbh  galaxy coevolution , because we have no cogent picture of how the host affects the hole , i.e.  of what causes smbh mass growth . we know that this must largely occur through accretion of gas :",
    "the @xcite relation implies that mass growth produces electromagnetic radiation with accretion efficiency @xmath3 rest  mass energy , at least at low redshifts .",
    "this rules out dark ",
    "matter accretion as a major contributor , and direct accretion of stars through tidal disruption is inefficient @xcite .",
    "because all gas has angular momentum , accretion on to the hole at the smallest scales must be through an accretion disk .",
    "but these scales must indeed be small : the viscous timescale @xmath4 approaches a hubble time at scales of only a few times @xmath5pc if the accreting gas can cool , so that the disk aspect ratio @xmath6 ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xmath7 is the standard @xcite viscosity parameter ) .",
    "however , if @xmath8 , the disk is self - gravitating and forms stars instead of accreting .",
    "therefore , for efficient black - hole growth , @xmath9 individual accretion events are required , each of which contributes only a small fraction of @xmath0 and lasts @xmath10yr @xcite , implying that the accretion disks have radii @xmath11pc .",
    "yet the gas that the hole must eventually accrete , which can be of order @xmath12 , must occupy a far larger region @xmath13pc .",
    "so the missing element in current treatments is a connection between these scales , telling us how gas falls from a region of size @xmath14 to make a succession of disks at scales @xmath15 . in numerical simulations of galaxy evolution ,",
    "@xcite accretion is a popular choice , but has several critical drawbacks .",
    "two of these are crucial .",
    "the first is that in reality all gas has significant angular momentum , and so can not fall in radially , in the way envisaged for bondi accretion .",
    "angular momentum is the main barrier to accretion .",
    "however since @xmath16 scale height of the ism , the cold gas in this region is probably not in large ",
    "scale rotation , i.e.  has a distribution of ( partly ) opposing angular momenta with a small net angular momentum .",
    "therefore , a way of cancelling these opposing angular momenta would greatly enhance accretion .",
    "a second serious problem in using the bondi formula is its implication that gas falls towards the black hole because of the destabilizing influence of its gravity .",
    "but the hole s mass is so small compared to that of even a small region of the galaxy that this is implausible . as we remarked above",
    ", the property of the hole which is highly significant for the galaxy is not its mass @xmath0 , but its binding energy @xmath17 , where @xmath18 . in mass terms , the hole is typically only one part in about @xmath19 of the galaxy bulge stellar mass @xmath2 @xcite . but for binding energies the situation is reversed : a hole of mass @xmath20 has @xmath21  erg , while the bulge binding energy is @xmath22  erg for a typical velocity dispersion @xmath23 ( this disparity is even bigger for smaller smbh if these follow the scaling relations ) .",
    "this suggests that the cause of black hole accretion ultimately involves its effects on the galaxy , i.e. feedback .",
    "we already know quite a lot about black  hole feedback in galaxies , and how it produces the smbh ",
    "galaxy scaling relations .",
    "what is important for our purposes here is that the feedback is carried by quasi ",
    "spherical winds driven by radiation pressure ; these are detected via blue  shifted x  ray iron absorption lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the winds have momentum scalars @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the eddington luminosity of the hole , @xmath26 is the wind outflow rate , and @xmath27 its velocity @xcite .",
    "the winds interact with the host galaxy by shocking against its interstellar gas , giving initial postshock temperatures @xmath28k .",
    "while the smbh is growing , these shocks lie close to the hole . here",
    "the much cooler ( @xmath29k ) radiation field produced by accretion removes most of the shock energy through the inverse compton effect @xcite .",
    "so only the wind ram pressure , i.e. the momentum rate @xmath30 mentioned above , is communicated to the host ism ( these are called ` momentum  driven ' flows ) .",
    "this thrust can push the host ism only modestly outwards , and is apparently unable to prevent the hole from growing .",
    "but once the hole mass reaches the @xmath31 scaling relation , i.e. @xmath32 with @xmath33 the local gas fraction , the wind shocks are able to move far away from the hole @xcite , beyond the critical radius @xmath34kpc where the radiation field of the accreting black hole becomes too dilute to cool the shocked wind .",
    "this now expands adiabatically ( ` energy  driven ' flow ) , sweeping the host ism before it at high speed ( @xmath35kms@xmath36 ) and largely clearing the galaxy bulge of gas @xcite .",
    "this terminates black hole growth , leaving the hole near the mass  ( [ eq : m : sigma ] ) .",
    "this sequence shows that the growth of the supermassive black hole towards the @xmath31 relation is characterized by quasispherical momentum ",
    "driven outflow episodes which push the interstellar gas out , but do not unbind it .",
    "this changes the dynamical state of the ism in two important ways .",
    "first , the smbh driven wind does not transfer angular momentum to the gas , but increases its gravitational energy .",
    "this results in a _ decrease _ of the typical pericentric radius of the gas .",
    "second , gas with differing angular momenta is pushed together , leading to ( partial ) cancellation .    when a black  hole accretion episode ends , the outward thrust supporting the gas against gravity drops , and it must fall back from the radius @xmath37 of the swept  up region . clearly , this infall is unlikely to be spherically symmetric . instead , individual clumps or high  density regions fall on ballistic orbits . because of the cancellation of angular momentum and the increase of gravitational energy during the outflow phase , these orbits are highly eccentric with pericenters much closer to the hole than the radii from which the gas was originally swept up during the wind feedback phase . on such eccentric orbits ,",
    "any gas cloud is likely to be tidally stretched , forming a stream , in particular near pericenter .",
    "we now estimate the resulting density of clouds / streams on such orbits .",
    "consider a population of clouds / streams orbiting with the same peri and apocentric radii @xmath38 , and hence with the same orbital energy and specific angular momentum @xmath39 here , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the total gravitational potential .",
    "neglecting collisions and internal shocks , the phase  space density of clouds / streams is conserved and simply the product of delta functions in @xmath42 and @xmath43 . integrating it over all velocities yields the spatial density @xmath44 with @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the total gas mass .",
    "we identify the apocenter with the radius of the initially swept  up shell , @xmath47 , and numerically evaluate @xmath48 and the mass @xmath49 enclosed at any time within radius @xmath50 . the resulting density and enclosed mass",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] for various pericenters but with the apocenter fixed at @xmath51 with @xmath52 the radius of the hole s sphere of influence . because eccentric orbits have a long residence time near apocenter , the density is maximal there and most of the gas is now further from the hole than before , in a kind of thick shell near @xmath37 .",
    "however , the infalling gas creates a second density maximum near pericenter , where the clouds / streams tend to collide with probability @xmath53 and with significant relative velocity . near apocentre ,",
    "on the other hand , collisions are not only less likely ( because the orbiting clouds simply return near to their initial position , avoiding each other ) but also have modest relative velocities and thus do not lead to cancelation of angular momentum .",
    "these high - impact - velocity collisions near pericentre ( which are neglected in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] ) lead to accretion ",
    "disk formation because the gas loses energy much faster than angular momentum , a process familiar from accretion in close binary systems .",
    "the colliding gas must shock and lose much of its orbital energy to cooling .",
    "in addition , the collisions may cancel some , potentially most , of the angular momentum , creating a cascade of ever smaller but less eccentric orbits . ultimately , gas on the innermost orbits circularises and forms a disk .",
    "if more gas penetrates to this radius , the disk is destroyed but quickly replaced by an even smaller one . moreover",
    ", any misalignment of the disk angular momentum with the black hole spin results in disk tearing , when angular  momentum cancellation leads to a further reduction of the inner disk radius by a factor @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "this whole process is rather complex and chaotic , but certainly has the potential to transfer some of the gas from @xmath55pc into an accretion disk at @xmath56pc , where standard viscosity ",
    "driven accretion physics takes over the mass transport , and feeds the smbh on a timescale of @xmath57yr .",
    "the fundamental feature of our picture is that once central accretion ( and hence feedback ) slows , gas is no longer supported against gravity .",
    "this suggests that during the chaotic infall phase , gas feeds a small  scale accretion disk around the smbh at some fraction of the dynamical infall rate @xmath58 for an smbh with mass @xmath0 close to @xmath59 , this exceeds the eddington accretion rate @xmath60 by factors @xmath61 at most @xcite .",
    "this feeding rate should characterise the rapid growth phases for the smbh . for gas fractions",
    "@xmath62 it implies disk feeding at rates a few times @xmath60 .",
    "this is likely to result in the following scenario ( cf .  king & pringle 2006 ; 2007 ) .",
    "the outer parts of the disk may become self  gravitating and form stars , while the remaining gas flows inwards under the disk viscosity at slightly super  eddington rates .",
    "this leads to smbh accretion at about @xmath60 , and similar mass outflow rates , with momentum scalars @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "this fits self  consistently with the feedback needed to give the observed @xmath64 scaling relation @xcite .",
    "once central accretion stops , the smbh should be quiescent for the sum of the infall timescale @xmath65 and the viscous timescale ( [ eq : t : visc ] ) .",
    "in general infall is more rapid , so the controlling timescale is probably viscous and depends critically on the radius @xmath66 at which the chaotic infall process places the disk .",
    "we note that in our picture , both the precise value of the mass feeding rate and its duty cycle are determined by essentially stochastic processes .",
    "this makes it difficult to go beyond the simple estimates given here either analytically or numerically .",
    "we return to this problem in the last section .",
    "we expect this same mechanism to produce the putative accretion ` torus ' at radii larger than @xmath66 .",
    "this structure is postulated @xcite to cover a large solid angle , obscuring the hole along many lines of sight , and so accounting for the populations of unobscured ( type i ) and obscured ( type ii ) active galactic nuclei .",
    "the main problem in understanding the torus in physical terms is that it must consist of cool material , which by its nature can not form a vertically extended disk or torus .",
    "however , a large solid angle is natural if much of this obscuring gas is not yet settled into a disk , but still falling in on a range of orbits of very different inclinations .",
    "the column density @xmath67 of a population of gas clouds / streams with total mass @xmath46 and common apo and pericentric radii is @xmath68 ( using equation  ( [ eq : rho ] ) with @xmath69 ) .",
    "this diverges for small pericentric radii @xmath70 , so the black hole must be obscured either completely or , more probably , for many lines of sight and/or extended periods of time .",
    "in fact , the obscuring matter may not be in form of a torus at all but merely a collection of clouds / streams orbiting the hole on eccentric orbits .",
    "whatever the geometry of the obscuring matter , our model renders the standard geometrical explanation for agn unification ( antonucci 1993 ) time  dependent , since the orientation of that matter changes randomly over time and because we expect cyclicly recurring inflow phases .",
    "this is in line with observational evidence of occasional changes between seyfert types ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our discussion so far has not specified the physical scale @xmath37 where the momentum  driven outflows are typically halted .",
    "our feeding mechanism works independently of this scale , but it may set the duty cycle and orientation of the individual accretion disk episodes .",
    "we note that @xcite have recently suggested that radiation pressure from the central active nucleus tends to create a shell of gas at a characteristic radius @xmath71pc , at which the gas becomes transparent to the radiation from the accretion disk .",
    "this is larger than the radius  ( [ eq : rinf ] ) of the sphere of influence by a factor @xmath72 and the shell s mass is comparable with the final mass @xmath59 of the hole . in this picture ,",
    "momentum  driven outflows must be halted here , as their inertia is of course far smaller .",
    "this means that @xmath73 .",
    "this idea agrees with observations of warm absorbers , which can be interpreted as arrested momentum  driven outflows .",
    "we have suggested that black hole feeding is ultimately caused by feedback . by elongating the gas orbits and promoting collisions ,",
    "this causes cancellation of opposed specific gas angular momenta , allowing accretion disks to form at small distances from the black hole , where they can feed the hole on time scales close to @xcite .",
    "this is different from a situation where the gas is initially pressure supported , when cooling and collisions of the resulting condensations can lead to turbulent infall @xcite .",
    "our picture explains a number of other aspects .",
    "as we have shown above , a near - toroidal topology for obscuring gas is a natural result .",
    "it is also clear that the orientation of the accretion structure ( disk + ` torus ' ) can not be constant over time , but must be essentially random .",
    "this is just the situation envisaged in the picture of chaotic accretion suggested by @xcite , which results in relatively low black hole spins .",
    "this implies rapid mass growth and low gravitational  wave recoil velocities for merging black holes .",
    "the impact of the black hole wind on the gas which ultimately falls in may cause some of it to form stars , and this can also happen in the collisions during gas infall .",
    "of course , any gas converted to and/or heated by stars is prevented from participating in the black hole feeding .",
    "however , at each feeding cycle only a small fraction of the gas within @xmath37 is required to reach @xmath66 , and only gas locked in stellar remnants and dwarfs is ultimately prevented from accreting .    because angular momentum has been largely cancelled , such newly formed stars fall in on near - parabolic orbits .",
    "this has several consequences .",
    "first , stars coming too close to the hole create visible tidal disruption events @xcite ; second , tidal dissociation of close binaries produces hypervelocity stars @xcite ; finally , massive stars which escape these fates inject metal  enriched gas into their surroundings . in any plausible picture",
    "most of this gas remains near to the hole , and could undergo repeated star formation .",
    "this may be the origin of the high chemical enrichment observed in agn spectra @xcite .",
    "we note that the idea of feedback  stimulated feeding opens the possibility of runaway growth : the black hole forages for its own food , and grows still faster .",
    "given an abundant food supply ( i.e. @xmath74 ) this growth is stopped only as the hole reaches the limiting @xmath75 mass and drives all the food away .",
    "a runaway smbh like this would of course have a tendency to grow at the eddington rate for most of its ( short ) feeding frenzy .",
    "this may explain very massive smbh observed at high redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here the close proximity of all galaxies means that many are likely to be gas ",
    "rich ( i.e. @xmath74 ) because of mergers , so runaways are favored",
    ".    one interesting aspect of the proposed mechanism is the mutual dependence of feeding and feedback on each other .",
    "clearly , this whole process must be started by some initial accretion which was _ not _ triggered by feedback , but by sufficient gas coming within @xmath76pc of the infant hole .",
    "such an event could be triggered by a galactic merger , but must be relatively rare .",
    "this implies that early smbh formation may be somewhat random , but more likely in frequently perturbed / merging galaxies .",
    "conversely , if the smbh s neighbourhood at @xmath77 acquires some net rotation , for example , during a merger , then the distribution of angular momenta is unlikely to allow for angular - momentum cancellation .",
    "in such a situation , the smbh suffers from starvation . despite sitting tantalisingly close to its food ,",
    "it can not reach it nor bring it down easily .",
    "however , if the rotating gas can cool , it will form a disk ( and possibly stars ) , clearing most of the space and opening the possibility for re - starting the feeding cycle .",
    "also , our proposed feeding mechanism will not work efficiently if the feedback is dominated by a collimated jet rather than wide ",
    "angle outflows .",
    "this is obvious if the impact shocks are efficiently cooled ( momentum  driven flow ) as the jet simply carves a narrow hole in the gas it impacts .",
    "if the shocks do not cool ( energy  driven ) , their effect is wider but still unlikely to cause feeding in the way described here .",
    "finally , we note that the episodic in and outflows of a fraction @xmath78 of matter at velocities well above @xmath1 entail abrupt changes in the gravitational potential in the inner @xmath79pc .",
    "therefore , the growth of the smbh is not an adiabatic process for the dynamics of collisionless matter on these scales .",
    "instead , the abrupt variations in the potential redistribute the orbital actions .",
    "this renders the central dark ",
    "matter density smaller than current estimates ( by e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) based on the adiabatic assumption , though possibly still larger than in absence of a smbh .",
    "this implies a significant reduction in the expected dark ",
    "matter annihilation signal from smbh hosting galaxy centers .",
    "we have suggested that feeding of supermassive black holes may in many cases be stimulated by feedback .",
    "a practical question is how one might implement this process in simulations of galaxy formation which can not resolve the hole s sphere of influence , let alone the dynamics and cooling of infall and outflow , and instead must use a subgrid recipe . clearly , any bondi - like subgrid recipe adapted to account for the angular momentum of the gas at @xmath80 can not adequately describe these dynamics .",
    "instead a completely different approach is required .",
    "we have seen that feedback - induced feeding generally occurs at a fraction of the dynamical infall rate ( [ eq : dm : dyn ] ) when it operates .",
    "this is generally slightly super  eddington ( for @xmath81 .",
    "this in turn makes the smbh grow at about the eddington rate , and rejects the remainder of the mass in a wind , which is what causes the feedback .",
    "if @xmath82 we know in reality this will result in momentum ",
    "driven feedback , which keeps the accretion going , and does not blow the gas away .",
    "once @xmath83 , the feedback changes character to energy  driven and terminates smbh mass growth .",
    "given the discussion above , a suitable subgrid recipe is as follows .",
    "grow @xmath0 from surrounding gas at the rate @xmath84 ( see equation  [ eq : dm : dyn ] ) with @xmath85 . if @xmath86 , _ neglect _ feedback .",
    "if @xmath83 , deposit _ energy _ into the surrounding gas at the rate @xmath87 @xcite .",
