    "the concept of @xmath0-symmetric heegard splittings has been introduced by birman and hilden ( see @xcite ) in an extrinsic way , depending on a particular embedding of the handlebodies of the splitting in the ambient space @xmath4 .",
    "the definition of such particular splittings was motivated by the aim to prove that every closed , orientable 3-manifold of heegaard genus @xmath5 is a 2-fold covering of @xmath2 branched over a link of bridge number @xmath6 and that , conversely , the 2-fold covering of @xmath2 branched over a link of bridge number @xmath7 is a closed , orientable 3-manifold of heegaard genus @xmath8 ( compare also @xcite ) .",
    "a genus @xmath9 heegaard splitting @xmath10 is called _ @xmath0-symmetric _ , with @xmath11 , if there exist a disjoint embedding of @xmath12 and @xmath13 into @xmath4 such that @xmath14 , for a translation @xmath15 of @xmath4 , and an orientation - preserving homeomorphism @xmath16 of period @xmath0 , such that @xmath17 and , if @xmath18 denotes the cyclic group of order @xmath0 generated by @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the orientation - preserving homeomorphism @xmath21 , the following conditions are fulfilled :    * @xmath22 is homeomorphic to a 3-ball ; * @xmath23 , for each @xmath24 ; * @xmath25 is an unknotted set of arcs properly embedded in a handlebody @xmath26 is _ unknotted _ if there is a set of mutually disjoint discs @xmath27 properly embedded in @xmath26 such that @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 . ] in the ball @xmath33 ; * there exists an integer @xmath34 such that @xmath35 .",

    "every closed , orientable 3-manifold of @xmath0-symmetric heegaard genus @xmath9 admits a representation as a @xmath0-fold cyclic covering of @xmath2 , branched over a link which admits a @xmath1-bridge presentation , where @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath0-fold cyclic covering of @xmath2 branched over a knot of braid number @xmath1 is a closed , orientable 3-manifold @xmath40 which admits a @xmath0-symmetric heegaard splitting of genus @xmath3 .    note that statement 2 is not a complete converse of 1 , since it only concerns knots and , moreover , @xmath1 denotes the braid number , which is greater than or equal to ( often greater than ) the bridge number . in this paper",
    "we fill this gap , giving a complete converse to statement 1 . since the coverings involved in 1 are strictly - cyclic ( see next section for details on strictly - cyclic branched coverings of links ) , our statement will concern this kind of coverings .",
    "more precisely , we shall prove in theorem [ theorem 3 ] that a @xmath0-fold strictly - cyclic covering of @xmath2 , branched over a link of bridge number @xmath1 , is a closed , orientable 3-manifold @xmath40 which admits a @xmath0-symmetric heegaard splitting of genus @xmath3 , and therefore has @xmath0-symmetric heegaard genus @xmath41 .",
    "this result gives an intrinsic interpretation of @xmath0-symmetric heegaard splittings as @xmath0-fold strictly - cyclic branched coverings of links .",

    "we set @xmath49 , for each @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , for each @xmath52 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "moreover , we set @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    the braid @xmath56 is realized through an ambient isotopy @xmath57\\to\\e^2\\times[0,1]$ ] , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is an homeomorphism of @xmath60 such that @xmath61 and @xmath62 , for every @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the braid @xmath56 naturally defines an orientation - preserving homeomorphism @xmath63 , which fixes the set @xmath64 .",
    "note that @xmath56 uniquely defines @xmath65 , up to isotopy of @xmath60 mod @xmath64 .",
    "connecting the point @xmath66 with @xmath67 by a circular arc @xmath68 ( called _ top arc _ ) and the point @xmath69 with @xmath70 by a circular arc @xmath71 ( called _ bottom arc _ ) , as in figure 1 , for each @xmath52 , we obtain a @xmath43-plat presentation of a link @xmath72 in @xmath4 , or equivalently in @xmath2 .",
    "as is well known , every link admits plat presentations and , moreover , a @xmath43-plat presentation corresponds to an @xmath73-bridge presentation of the link .",
    "so , the bridge number @xmath74 of a link @xmath72 is the smallest positive integer @xmath73 such that @xmath72 admits a representation by a @xmath43-plat . for further details on braid , plat and bridge presentations of links",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "* remark 2 * a @xmath43-plat presentation of a link @xmath75 furnishes a @xmath76-decomposition @xcite @xmath77 of the link , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the 3-balls @xmath80-\\infty,0])\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ ] and @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 is defined by @xmath85 and @xmath86 , for each @xmath87 .",
    "if a @xmath43-plat presentation of a @xmath88-component link @xmath89 is given , each component @xmath90 of @xmath72 contains @xmath91 top arcs and @xmath91 bottom arcs . obviously , @xmath92 .",
    "a @xmath43-plat presentation of a link @xmath72 will be called _ special _ if :    * the top arcs and the bottom arcs belonging to @xmath93 are @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively , the top arcs and the bottom arcs belonging to @xmath96 are @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively , @xmath99 , the top arcs and the bottom arcs belonging on @xmath100 are @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively ; * @xmath103 and @xmath104 , for each @xmath52 .",
    "it is clear that , because of ( 2 ) , the homeomorphism @xmath105 , associated to a @xmath43-string braid @xmath56 defining a special plat presentation , keeps fixed both the sets @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "although a special plat presentation of a link is a very particular case , we shall prove that every link admits such kind of presentation .",
    "let @xmath72 be presented by a @xmath43-plat .",
    "we show that this presentation is equivalent to a special one , by using a finite sequence of moves on the plat presentation which changes neither the link type nor the number of plats .",
    "the moves are of the four types @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 depicted in figure 2 .",
    "first of all , it is straightforward that condition ( 1 ) can be satisfied by applying a suitable sequence of moves of type @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , condition ( 2 ) is equivalent to the following : @xmath113 there exists an orientation of @xmath72 such that , for each @xmath52 , the top arc @xmath68 is oriented from @xmath66 to @xmath67 and the bottom arc @xmath71 is oriented from @xmath70 to @xmath69 . therefore , choose any orientation on @xmath72 and apply moves of type @xmath111 ( resp .",
    "moves of type @xmath112 ) to the top arcs ( resp .",
    "bottom arcs ) which are oriented from @xmath67 to @xmath66 ( resp . from @xmath69 to @xmath70 ) .",
    "a @xmath0-fold branched cyclic covering of an oriented @xmath88-component link @xmath114 is completely determined ( up to equivalence ) by assigning to each component @xmath90 an integer @xmath115 , such that the set @xmath116 generates the group @xmath117 .",
    "the monodromy associated to the covering sends each meridian of @xmath90 , coherently oriented with the chosen orientations of @xmath72 and @xmath2 , to the permutation @xmath118 . multiplying each @xmath119 by the same invertible element of @xmath120",
    ", we obtain an equivalent covering .      * _ strictly - cyclic _ if @xmath121 , for every @xmath122 , * _ almost - strictly - cyclic _ if @xmath123 , for every @xmath122 , * _ meridian - cyclic _ if @xmath124 , for every @xmath125 , * _ singly - cyclic _ if @xmath124 , for some @xmath125 , * _ monodromy - cyclic _ if it is cyclic .",
    "the following implications are straightforward : @xmath126 moreover , the five definitions are equivalent when @xmath72 is a knot .",
    "similar definitions and properties also hold for a @xmath0-fold cyclic covering of a 3-ball , branched over a set of properly embedded ( oriented ) arcs .",
    "it is easy to see that , by a suitable reorientation of the link , an almost - strictly - cyclic covering becomes a strictly - cyclic one . as a consequence , it follows from remark 1 that every branched cyclic covering of a link arising from a @xmath0-symmetric heegaard splitting  according to birman - hilden construction  is strictly - cyclic .",
    "[ theorem 3 ] a @xmath0-fold strictly - cyclic covering of @xmath2 branched over a link @xmath72 of bridge number @xmath1 is a closed , orientable 3-manifold @xmath40 which admits a @xmath0-symmetric heegaard splitting of genus @xmath3 .",
    "so the @xmath0-symmetric heegaard genus of @xmath40 is @xmath127    let @xmath72 be presented by a special @xmath128-plat arising from a braid @xmath56 , and let @xmath129 be the @xmath130-decomposition described in remark 2 .",
    "now , all arguments of the proofs of theorem 3 of @xcite entirely apply and the condition of lemma 4 of @xcite is satisfied , since the homeomorphism @xmath105 associated to @xmath56 fixes both the sets @xmath106 and @xmath107 .    as a consequence of theorem [ theorem 3 ] and birman - hilden results",
