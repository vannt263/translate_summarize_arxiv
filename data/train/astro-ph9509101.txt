    "about one tenth of the known radio pulsars reside in a binary system .",
    "two have massive , early - type companions , and have properties rather similar to the average isolated radio pulsar .",
    "these presumably have been formed in a supernova explosion of a star in an early - type binary .",
    "most of the others have evolved companions  either white dwarfs or neutron stars  and differ markedly from ( most of ) their isolated counterparts , showing more rapid spin periods and smaller magnetic fields ( for recent reviews , see bhattacharya & van den heuvel @xcite ; verbunt @xcite ; phinney & kulkarni @xcite ; kulkarni @xcite ; these references have been used throughout this section ) .",
    "the rapid spin is generally believed to result from a phase of mass transfer in the evolutionary history of the binary , during which a large amount of mass and angular momentum is accreted .",
    "the reduction of the magnetic field is thought to occur in this phase as well , but the physical mechanism underlying this ( e.g. , it being `` buried '' by the accreted matter ) is not understood .",
    "the radio pulsars with evolved companions can be divided into three groups , generally referred to as the low- , intermediate- and high - mass binary pulsars ( hereafter , lmbp , imbp and hmbp , respectively ) .",
    "while these classifications are made on the basis of the inferred mass of the companion ( from the mass function ) , stellar evolutionary scenarios allow us to relate these systems to the descendents of binaries composed of a neutron star and a low - mass ( @xmath0 ) , intermediate - mass ( @xmath1 ) and high - mass ( @xmath2 ) secondary , respectively .",
    "the expectation is that these secondaries evolve to helium white dwarfs , carbon - oxygen ( c - o ) white dwarfs , and neutron stars , respectively .",
    "there is a fairly systematic trend of decrease in magnetic field strength as one proceeds from hmbps to lmbps . presumably , this reflects the decrease in speed with which evolution proceeds in these systems , and the corresponding increase of the total amount of matter that is accreted .",
    "observations of the white - dwarf companions provide a number of diagnostics for these objects .",
    "for instance , the surface temperature of the white dwarf can be used to infer a cooling age , which sets a lower limit to the age of the neutron star .",
    "such limits have been derived from broad - band photometry for psr  0655 + 64 ( kulkarni @xcite ) , 0820 + 02 ( ibid . ;",
    "koester , chanmugan , & reimers @xcite ) , 1855 + 09 ( callanan et al .  ; kulkarni , djorgovski , & klemola @xcite ) , j0437@xmath34715 ( bailyn @xcite ; bell , bailes , & bessel @xcite ; danziger , baade , & della valle @xcite ) , and j1012 + 5307 ( lorimer et al .  ) , and they provide the strongest evidence so far that magnetic fields of neutron stars do not decay on a time scale of millions of years , as had been thought before . in the absence of good constraints on the masses of the white dwarfs , however , the cooling ages can not be very accurately determined .",
    "mass determinations would not only lead to better constraints on the cooling ages , but also allow one to verify , e.g. , the orbital - period , white - dwarf mass relation predicted for the lmbp ( refsdal & weigert @xcite ; savonije @xcite ; joss , rappaport , & lewis @xcite ; rappaport et al .  ) , or to constrain the mass of the neutron star .",
    "in addition , they could be used to obtain independent distance estimates to the systems , which can be compared to those derived from the dispersion measure of the pulsar .",
    "constraints on the white - dwarf mass can be derived from shapiro delay , but this is possible for only a few binaries with favorable geometries .",
    "another possibility is to use spectroscopy of the white dwarfs . in recent years",
    ", much progress has been made in the spectroscopic determination of surface gravities ( and hence masses and radii ) , especially for white dwarfs of spectral type da , i.e. , those with a hydrogen atmosphere ( e.g. , bergeron , saffer , & liebert @xcite ) .",
    "spectroscopy of the very faint companions of binary pulsars is non - trivial , and has so far only been attempted for the brightest , that of psr  j0437@xmath34715 ( danziger et al.@xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , that white dwarf is rather cool ( @xmath4k ) , and no line features were detected .    here , we present spectroscopy of two somewhat fainter , but hotter companions , one of an imbp , psr  0655 + 64 , and one of a lmbp , psr  0820 + 02 . for recent radio studies of these binaries , see taylor & dewey ( @xcite ) and jones & lyne ( @xcite ) . for previous optical studies , see the references listed above",
    "spectra were taken on new year s eve of 1995 at the keck 10 m telescope with the low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ) . with the @xmath5 grating",
    ", the wavelength range of 3750 to 8780  was covered at at @xmath6 .",
    "the observing conditions were good throughout the night , but a substantial amount of time was lost due to telescope problems .",
    "three spectra were taken of the companion of psr  0655 + 64 ( @xmath7mag ) , starting at 1 january 1995 , 8:54 , 9:56 and 10:16  ut , with integration times of 30 , 15 and 45 minutes , respectively .",
    "for the first spectrum , the slit was positioned over the companion and a nearby elliptical galaxy ( see kulkarni @xcite ) , while for the latter two it was set close to the parallactic angle .",
    "a 0.7  wide slit was used , giving a resolution of @xmath8 .",
    "the companion of psr  0820 + 02 ( @xmath9mag ) was observed for 45 minutes starting at 14:26  ut , using a 1  slit to improve the throughput ( leading to a resolution of @xmath10 ) . for approximate flux calibration ,",
    "the spectrophotometric standard hd84937 ( oke & gunn @xcite ) was observed .",
    "the reduction of all spectra was done using midas and programs running in the midas environment .",
    "the frames were bias - corrected , flat - fielded and sky - subtracted using standard procedures .",
    "the spectra were extracted using an optimal - extraction method similar to that presented by horne ( @xcite ) .",
    "it turned out that the different exposures of the flux standard were inconsistent in both level and slope of the continuum .",
    "since flux calibration was thus impossible , we normalized the spectra for the representation shown here ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "this was done by dividing by a continuum defined by one of the flux - standard spectra , and scaling by @xmath11 , with @xmath12 chosen such that the continuum appeared straight .",
    "the spectra of the companion of psr  0655 + 64 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) are those of a dq star , showing strong  bands ( for a review of white - dwarf spectra , see wesemael et al .  ) .",
    "the  bands are thought to be due to traces of carbon in a helium - rich atmosphere , brought up by convection from a deeper region , which is enriched in carbon due to upwards diffusion of carbon from the core ( pelletier et al .  ) .",
    "thus , the presence of the swan bands directly confirms the expectation that the object is a carbon - oxygen white dwarf .",
    "the presence of the swan bands , combined with the absence of lines from atomic carbon , also indicates that the temperature is between 6000 and 9000  k ( inferred from wegner & yackovich @xcite and wesemael et al .  ) .",
    "this compares well with the range of 5500 to 8000  k derived from photometry of this star ( kulkarni @xcite ) , and hence provides independent confirmation of the conclusion of kulkarni ( @xcite ) that the cooling age of the white dwarf is about @xmath13yr , comparable to the characteristic age of @xmath14yr of the pulsar .    from the three spectra that we have",
    ", one can see that the strength of the c@xmath15 features is variable .",
    "in fact , the total equivalent width changes by a factor of 2 over the two hours spanned by the observations , from about 170 to 330@xmath16  in the range 44305650 .",
    "as far as we know , this is unprecedented . since white dwarfs in general are not particularly variable stars , it is tempting to relate the changes to fixed surface patterns  due to , e.g. , abundance or temperature variations , perhaps related to the presence of a magnetic field as in magnetic ap stars ( borra , landstreet , & mestel @xcite )  that are rotated in and out of the observed hemisphere .",
    "if so , then from the swiftness of the change in the spectrum , the strength of the features , and the integration times , it is easy to see that a possible periodicity can not be shorter than about 3 hours ( otherwise , the changes would be washed out ) , or longer than about 12 hours ( to allow a change from about 30 to about 70% depth of the strongest part of the absorption ) .",
    "this is substantially shorter than the orbital period , and thus an association with orbital variations  such as could be produced by , e.g. , heating of one hemisphere  seems unlikely .",
    "if we associate the variations with the rotation of the white dwarf , then its rotation period has to be two to eight times shorter than the orbital one .",
    "this might actually not be unexpected : the progenitor of the white dwarf was a helium giant transferring mass to the pulsar ( e.g. , iben & tutukov @xcite ) , and if it was rotating synchronously  as does not seem implausible given the extremely circular orbit ( @xmath17 ; jones & lyne @xcite )  then it would have been spun up due to conservation of angular momentum when it shrunk to form a white dwarf .",
    "in fact , we can set a rough upper limit to the mass of the envelope that fell back onto the white dwarf if we assume that the effect due to the shrinking of the core can be neglected .",
    "for this case , the moment of inertia in the envelope has to be at least equal that of the core  or equivalently ( by assumption ) that of the white dwarf  in order to be able to spin it up by at least a factor two . hence",
    ", the mass of the envelope should be @xmath18 ( ignoring differences in structure ) . since the progenitor was filling its roche lobe , @xmath19 ( using eq .",
    "10.1 of phinney & kulkarni @xcite ) . with @xmath20 and @xmath21 ,",
    "one finds a mass of the envelope of a few @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly , this is similar to the mass of the helium envelope that is inferred for dq stars from the presence and strength of the carbon features ( pelletier et al .  ; but see also weideman & koester @xcite ; dehner & kawaler @xcite ) .    while we realise that our estimate is a rough one",
    " the very existence of a periodicity still needs to be confirmed  we note that , in principle , it might be possible to use rotation periods of white dwarfs in similar systems to constrain the final phases of the evolution . especially for the systems with somewhat longer orbital periods , where the angular momentum is dominated by the envelope , the final spin rate should depend almost uniquely on the radius of the giant .",
    "since the latter is related to the orbital period , one might expect , e.g. , to find a correlation between the spin period and orbital period in such systems .",
    "in contrast to the companion of psr  0655 + 64 , this white dwarf shows strong lines of hydrogen ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) , making it a da white dwarf . as mentioned in the introduction , for a da white dwarf it is possible to determine surface temperature and gravity uniquely from the spectrum . from a first comparison of the spectrum with model atmospheres , kindly done for us by dr .",
    "bergeron , it follows that it is consistent with the temperature being in the range of 14000 to 16500  k found by koester et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the best - fitting surface gravities for that range would indicate a mass of 0.25 to 0.35@xmath23 , consistent with the idea that it is a helium white dwarf .",
    "however , the spectrum is of insufficient quality to set a strong limit : the 95% upper limit to the mass is @xmath24 .",
    "thus , it is not yet possible to verify whether the mass is within the range of 0.42 to 0.60@xmath25 expected from the orbital - period , white - dwarf mass relation ( rappaport et al . ) .    from photometry , combined with an upper limit of 1.9kpc to the distance , koester et al .",
    "( @xcite ) derived a lower limit of about @xmath26 to the mass of the companion of psr  0820 + 02 . indeed , if the white dwarf were to have a mass of about @xmath27 , it would have @xmath28mag ( bergeron , private communication ) , and with @xmath29mag and @xmath30mag ( koester et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the system would be at a distance of @xmath31kpc .",
    "we note , however , that the distance limit koester et al .",
    "used was derived by taking twice the distance of 0.95kpc indicated by the dispersion measure of @xmath32 ( taylor & dewey @xcite ) combined with the model of the galactic electron distribution of lyne , manchester , & taylor ( @xcite ) . with the more recent model of taylor & cordes ( @xcite ) , one would infer a distance of 1.4kpc .",
    "taylor & cordes estimate that the mean uncertainty in the new dispersion - measure derived distances is about 25% , but they note that there is a dependence on the position of the pulsar . for psr  0820 + 02 , at @xmath33 , @xmath34 , we find from their figures  7 and 8 that the model is substantially more uncertain .",
    "while it is thus at present not possible to constrain the mass unambiguously , we note that for a @xmath35 white dwarf , koester et al .",
    "( @xcite ) derived that the cooling age was within an `` allowed range '' of 1.5 to @xmath36yr , which seems only marginally consistent with the characteristic age of @xmath37yr of the neutron star ( which should be an upper limit to the true age ) .",
    "if the white dwarf were to have a lower mass , the two age estimates would be in better agreement .",
    "we have presented spectra of the white - dwarf companions of the radio pulsars 0655 + 64 and 0820 + 02 . from these spectra ,",
    "combined with published temperature determinations , we can classify the two as dq69 and da3/4 , respectively .",
    "this confirms the expectation that the former is a carbon - oxygen white dwarf , and is consistent with the latter being a helium white dwarf .",
    "as hoped , it will be possible to derive accurate temperatures and surface gravities for the companion of psr  0820 + 02 . while this will likely be difficult for the companion of psr  0655 + 64 , its changing spectrum",
    "may instead turn out to provide us with a unique possibility to learn more about its previous evolution , as well as about the formation of spectral features in white dwarfs .",
    "it seems clear that further spectral studies of both these and other pulsar companions are warranted .",
    "we are very grateful to pierre bergeron for making the model - atmosphere comparisons , and thank him , brad hansen , yanqin wu , and peter goldreich for useful discussions .",
