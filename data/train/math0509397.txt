    "in 1931 dnes knig @xcite proved a min - max duality theorem on bipartite graphs :    [ finitekonig ] in any finite bipartite graph , the maximal size of a matching equals the minimal size of a cover of the edges by vertices .    here",
    "a _ matching _ in a graph is a set of disjoint edges , and a _",
    "cover _ ( of the edges by vertices ) is a set of vertices meeting all edges .",
    "this theorem was the culmination of a long development , starting with a paper of frobenius in 1912 . for details on the intriguing history of this theorem ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "four years after the publication of knig s paper phillip hall @xcite proved a result which he named `` the marriage theorem '' . to formulate it , we need the following notation : given a set @xmath0 of vertices in a graph , we denote by @xmath4 the set of its neighbors .    in a finite bipartite graph with sides @xmath5 and @xmath6 there exists a marriage of @xmath5 ( that is , a matching meeting all vertices of @xmath5 ) if and only if @xmath7 for every subset @xmath0 of @xmath5 .",
    "the two theorems are closely related , in the sense that they are easily derivable from each other .",
    "in fact , knig s theorem is somewhat stronger , in that the derivation of hall s theorem from it is more straightforward than vice versa .    at the time of publication of knig s theorem ,",
    "a theorem generalizing it considerably was already known .",
    "[ separation ] let @xmath8 be two sets of vertices in a digraph @xmath9 .",
    "a set @xmath3 of vertices is called @xmath10@xmath11-_separating _ if every @xmath10@xmath11-path meets @xmath3 , namely if the deletion of @xmath3 severs all @xmath10@xmath11-paths .",
    "note that , in particular , @xmath3 must contain @xmath12 .",
    "the minimal size of an @xmath10@xmath11-separating set is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "the maximal size of a family of vertex - disjoint paths from @xmath10 to @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath14 .    in 1927",
    "karl menger @xcite published the following :    for any two sets @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a finite digraph there holds : @xmath15    this was probably the first casting of a combinatorial result in min - max form .",
    "there was a gap in menger s proof : he assumed , without proof , the bipartite case of the theorem , which is theorem [ finitekonig ] .",
    "this gap was filled by knig . since then other ways of deriving menger s theorem from knig s theorem",
    "have been found , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "soon thereafter erds , who was knig s student , proved that , with the very same formulation , the theorem is also valid for infinite graphs .",
    "this appeared in knig s book @xcite , the first book published on graph theory .",
    "the idea of the proof is this : take a maximal family @xmath2 of @xmath0@xmath1-disjoint paths .",
    "the set @xmath16 is then @xmath0@xmath1-separating , since an @xmath0@xmath1-path avoiding it could be added to @xmath2 , contradicting the maximality of @xmath2 . since every path in @xmath2 is finite ,",
    "if @xmath2 is infinite then @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath18 and @xmath19 , this implies the non - trivial inequality @xmath20 of the theorem . if @xmath2 is finite , then so is @xmath3 .",
    "the size of families of disjoint @xmath21 paths is thus finitely bounded ( in fact , bounded by @xmath22 ) , and hence there exists a finite family of maximal cardinality of disjoint @xmath0@xmath1 paths . in this case",
    "one can apply one of many proofs known for the finite case of the theorem ( see , e.g. , theorem [ blockingsimply ] below , or @xcite ) .",
    "of course , there is some  cheating \" here . the separating set",
    "produced in the case that @xmath2 is infinite is obviously too  large \" . in the finite case",
    "the fact that @xmath23 implies that there is just one @xmath3-vertex on each path of @xmath2 , while in the infinite case the equality of cardinalities does not imply this .",
    "erds conjectured that , in fact , the same relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath2 can be obtained also in the infinite case .",
    "since it is now proved , we state it as a theorem :    [ erdos][main ] given two sets of vertices , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in a ( possibly infinite ) digraph , there exists a family @xmath2 of disjoint @xmath0@xmath1-paths , and a separating set consisting of the choice of precisely one vertex from each path in @xmath2 .",
    "the earliest reference in writing to this conjecture is @xcite ( problem 8 , p. 159 .",
    "see also @xcite ) .",
    "the first to be tackled was of course the bipartite case , and the first breakthrough was made by podewski and steffens @xcite , who proved the countable bipartite case of the conjecture , namely the countable case of knig s theorem .",
    "that paper established some of the basic concepts that were used in later work on the conjecture , and also set the basic approach : introducing an a - symmetry into the problem . in the conjecture ( now theorem ) the roles of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are symmetrical ; the proof in @xcite starts with asking the question of when can a given side of a bipartite graph be matched into the other side , namely the problem of extending hall s theorem to the infinite case .",
    "known as the  marriage problem \" , this question was open since the publication of hall s paper , and podewski and steffens solved its countable case . around the same time , nash - williams formulated two other necessary criteria for matchability ( the existence of marriage ) , and he @xcite and damerell and milner @xcite proved their sufficiency for countable bipartite graphs .",
    "these criteria are more explicit , but in hindsight the concepts used in @xcite are more fruitful .",
    "podewski and steffens @xcite made yet another important progress : they proved the conjecture for countable digraphs containing no infinite paths .",
    "later , in @xcite , it was realized that this case can be easily reduced to the bipartite case , by the familiar device of doubling vertices in the digraph , thus transforming the digraph into a bipartite graph .",
    "at that point in time there were two obstacles on the way to the proof of the conjecture - uncountability and the existence of infinite paths .",
    "the first of the two to be overcome was that of uncountability . in 1983",
    "the marriage problem was solved for general cardinalities , in @xcite . soon thereafter , this was used to prove the infinite version of knig s theorem @xcite .",
    "namely , the bipartite case of theorem [ erdos ] was proved .",
    "let us state it explicitly :    [ infkonig ] in any bipartite graph there exists a matching @xmath24 and a cover @xmath25 , such that @xmath25 consists of the choice of precisely one vertex from each edge in @xmath24 .",
    "as is well known , hall s theorem fails in the infinite case .",
    "the standard example is that of the `` playboy '' : take a graph with sides @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "for every @xmath28 connect @xmath29 to @xmath30 , and connect @xmath31 ( the playboy ) to all @xmath30 .",
    "then every subset of @xmath5 is connected to at least as many points in @xmath6 as its size , and yet there is no marriage of @xmath5 .",
    "this is just another indication that in the case of infinite matchings , cardinality is too crude a measure .",
    "but theorem [ infkonig ] has an interesting corollary : that if `` cardinality '' is interpreted _ in terms of the graph _ , then hall s theorem does apply also in the infinite case .",
    "given two sets , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , of vertices in a graph @xmath34 , we say that @xmath32 is _ matchable into @xmath33 _ if there exists an injection of @xmath32 into @xmath33 using edges of @xmath34 .",
    "we write @xmath35 if @xmath32 is matchable into @xmath33 , but @xmath33 is not matchable into @xmath32 .",
    "( the ordinary notion of @xmath36 is obtained when @xmath34 is the complete graph on a vertex set containing @xmath37 . )",
    "a _ marriage _ of a side of a bipartite graph is a matching covering all its vertices . from theorem [ infkonig ] there",
    "follows :    [ infmarriage ] given a bipartite graph @xmath38 with sides @xmath5 and @xmath6 , there does _ not _ exist a marriage of @xmath5 if and only if there exists @xmath39 , such that @xmath40 .",
    "to see how theorem [ infmarriage ] follows from theorem [ infkonig ] , assume that there is no marriage of @xmath5 , and let @xmath24 and @xmath25 be as in theorem [ infkonig ]",
    ". let @xmath41 .",
    "then the set of points connected to @xmath32 is obviously @xmath42 $ ] ( the set of points connected by @xmath24 to @xmath32 ) , which is matchable by @xmath24 into @xmath32 .",
    "if there existed a matching @xmath43 of @xmath32 , then @xmath44 would be a marriage of @xmath5 , contrary to assumption .",
    "thus @xmath32 is unmatchable .",
    "the other implication in the theorem is obvious .",
    "proof - wise , the order is in fact reverse : theorem [ infmarriage ] is proved first , and from it theorem [ infkonig ] follows , in a way that will be explained later , in section 5 .    by the result of @xcite",
    ", there follows from theorem [ infkonig ] also theorem [ erdos ] for all graphs containing no infinite ( unending or non - starting ) paths .",
    "thus there remained the problem of infinite paths .",
    "the difficulty they pose is that when one tries to `` grow '' the disjoint paths desired in the conjecture , they may end up being infinite , instead of being @xmath0@xmath1-paths .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it is proved that theorem [ erdos ] is true , if one allows in @xmath2 not only @xmath0@xmath1-paths , but any paths that if they start at all , they do so at @xmath0 , and if they end they do so at @xmath1 .    the first breakthrough in the struggle against infinite paths was made in @xcite , where the countable case of the conjecture was proved .",
    "an equivalent , hall - type , conjecture , was formulated , and the latter was proved for countable digraphs .",
    "the core of the proof was in a lemma , stating that if the hall - like condition is satisfied , then any point in @xmath0 can be linked to @xmath1 by a path , whose removal leaves the hall - like condition intact .",
    "the lemma is quite easy to prove in the bipartite case and also in graphs containing no unending paths , but in the general countable case it requires new tools and methods .",
    "later , the sufficiency of the hall - like condition for linkability ( linking @xmath0 into @xmath1 by disjoint paths ) was proved for graphs in which all but countably many points of @xmath0 are linked to @xmath1 @xcite , and theorem [ erdos ] was proved for such graphs in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "a reduction was shown of the @xmath45 case of the conjecture to the above mentioned lemma .",
    "namely , a proof of the conjecture was given for digraphs of size @xmath45 , assuming that the lemma is true for such digraphs .",
    "combined with a proof of the lemma for graphs with no unending paths , and for graphs with countable outdegrees , this settled the conjecture for digraphs of size at most @xmath45 , satisfying one of those properties .",
    "optimistically , @xcite declares that this reduction should probably work for general graphs .",
    "the breakthrough leading to the solution of the general case was indeed the proof of this lemma for general graphs .",
    "as claimed in @xcite , the way from the lemma to the proof of the theorem indeed follows the same outline as in the @xmath45 case .",
    "but the general case demands quite a bit more effort .",
    "for the sake of relative self containment of the paper , most results from previous papers will be re - proved .",
    "one non - standard notation that we shall use is this : for a directed edge @xmath46 in a digraph we write @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the rest of the notation is mostly standard , but here are a few reminders . given a digraph @xmath9 and a subset @xmath10 of @xmath49 we write @xmath50 $ ] for the graph induced by @xmath9 on @xmath10 . given a set @xmath51 of vertices in an undirected graph , we denote by @xmath52 the set of neighbors of vertices of @xmath51 . in a digraph",

    "similar abuse of notation will apply also to other notions , without explicit mention .      a _ web _",
