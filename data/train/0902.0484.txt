    "one of pioneering approaches towards prospective spintronic devices is to manipulate electron spins by utilizing spin - orbit coupling in non - magnetic semiconductors , particularly in low - dimensional iii - vi semiconductor heterostructures ( quantum wells , wires , and dots ) owing to their great flexibility in manipulating spin properties of the electronic states.@xcite unlike electron charge , electron spin is not conserved and generally relaxes to un - polarized states in solids . there",
    "exist competing spin relaxation channels : spin - flip through electron - impurity scattering , known as elliott and yafet ( ey ) mechanism,@xcite spin - flip through electron - hole exchange scattering known as biraranovpikus ( bap ) mechanism,@xcite and spin - flip through spin - orbital coupling known as dyakonovperel ( dp ) mechanism.@xcite the relative importance of these mechanisms is strongly dependent on semiconductor structure , temperature and carrier concentration .",
    "inas / gaas heterostructures as one of the potential spintronic building blocks have received intensive attention for a couple of decades .",
    "since the quantum islands formed in inas submonolayers display a narrow size distribution as revealed by their sharp pl spectrum ( @xmath22 mev ) , it is of advantage to utilize spin states of submonolayer structures for the sake of almost unified electronic states which are hard to achieve for self - assembled quantum dots due to wide size distribution .",
    "nevertheless , there are few experiments addressing the spin dynamics in ultrathin inas layers .    in this paper , we study the spin relaxation in inas / gaas heterostructures consisting of a single layer of inas with respectively effective thickness of 1/3 , 1/2 and 1 monolayer by time resolved kerr rotation spectroscopy . the spin relaxation time is found to be increased with decreased inas coverage .",
    "this behavior could be attributed to lateral restriction under the dp mechanism .",
    "ultrathin inas layer is a kind of inas / gaas heterostructure in which a single inas layer is sandwiched in a gaas matrix .",
    "the samples were grown by elemental source mbe on ( 001 ) and ( 311)a - oriented gaas semi - insulating substrates .",
    "the structures consist of a gaas buffer layer , cladding layers and an inas layer . each cladding layer is composed of 40 period gaas / al@xmath3ga@xmath4as superlattices ( sl ) and a gaas layer .",
    "the use of gaas / algaas sl improves sample quality by preventing surface recombination and trapping defects .",
    "the single inas layer with various effective thicknesses is sandwiched between the cladding layers .",
    "the details of the growth could be found elsewhere.@xcite to study the lateral size effect on the spin relaxation process , three samples with 1/3 , 1/2 and 1 monolayer ( ml ) inas , respectively , on ( 001 ) substrates and one with 1 ml inas on ( 311)a substrate were prepared . the 1ml inas layer on ( 001 ) surface is assumed to be an ideal two dimensional ( 2d ) system . instead , due to the intrinsic surface corrugation,@xcite the 1ml inas layer on ( 311)a surface forms wire or disk like micro - structures on the gaas steps and facets .",
    "while for the 1/2 ml and 1/3 ml samples on ( 001 ) surface , inas is found to be organized as wire - like or disk - like islands elongated along [ @xmath5 direction with lateral size in the range of tens of nanometers due to the fractional surface coverage.@xcite the four samples , with the same thickness but different lateral sizes , provide an excellent system to demonstrate the suppression of spin relaxation process by lateral size constriction down to 10s nm , without bringing significant spin scattering by the edge defects as observed in narrow channel devices fabricated by etching process.@xcite    = 0@xmath6 and ( b ) @xmath7=0.82@xmath6 for samples with inas thickness of 1/3 ml , 1/2 ml and 1ml , respectively .",
    "the temperature is at 77@xmath8 .",
    "the data of the sample on ( 311 ) substrate is also shown .",
    "the pumping density is about @xmath9 .",
    ", width=302 ]    to study the coherent spin dynamics , an optical pump - probe spectroscopy technique called time - resolved kerr rotation ( kr ) spectroscopy is used .",
    "a circularly polarized pump pulse generates a well - defined carrier spin population , and the kr angle of a linearly polarized probe light is detected by a balanced optical bridge .",
    "the time delayed probe pulse reflects the time evolution of the projection of the electron spin states , which precesses perpendicularly to the transverse external magnetic field .",
    "both pump and probe pulses are obtained from a tunable mode - locked ti : sapphire laser with a pulse width about 150__fs _ _ and a repetition rate of 80mhz .",
    "the pump beam size is about 30 mm in focus and the size of the probe beam is tuned to be a little bit smaller than that .",
    "the typical excitation powers are 0.5@xmath010__mw _ _ for the pump and 0.5__mw _ _ for the probe beams . to get an excellent signal - to - noise ratio , a double lock - in detection technique",
    "is employed with the amplitude modulation of the probe beam at 115__hz _ _ with an optical chopper and the polarization modulation of the pump beam at 50__khz _ _ with a photoelastic modulator .",
    "the measurements were carried out in a magneto - optical cryostat in voigt geometry with a tunable photon energy of 1.45@xmath01 .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the kr signals at zero external field for samples with inas thickness of 1/3 ml , 1/2 ml and 1ml , respectively .",
    "the temperature was 77__k _ _ and the pumping density was kept at low level with pumping / probe ratio of 1:1 and the carrier density was estimated to be about 5x10@xmath10/@xmath11 .",
    "these data depict that there is a fast decay of the spin polarization during the very first 10 picoseconds after excitation , and followed by a long - lifetime simple exponential decay process .",
    "the fast decay originates from the loss of hole spin polarization since the hole spin lifetime is short due to strong valence band mixing and _ k_-dependent spin splitting.@xcite the evolution of the kr angle thereafter can be described by a single exponential decay @xmath12 for all the samples , where @xmath13 is proportional to the initial amplitude of the electron - spin polarization , _ t _ is the time delay between the circularly polarized pump and the linearly polarized probe pulse and @xmath14 is the electron spin relaxation time .",
    "the independent evolution of the electron and hole spin polarization indicates that we do not need to take the exciton spin as a constituent as previously studied using time - resolved photoluminescence at these temperatures.@xcite the spin relaxation time for the 1/3 , 1/2 and 1ml samples on ( 001 ) surface are extracted to be 1500__ps _ _ , 984__ps _ _ and 380__ps _ _ , respectively .",
    "the spin relaxation time for the 1ml sample on ( 311)a surface is determined to be 860__ps__. these data clearly evidence that the electron spin lifetime is significantly increased as the lateral size is gradually reduced , of which the mechanism will be discussed later .    figure 1(b ) exhibits the kr data at in - plane external magnetic field @xmath7=0.82_t _ for the four samples .",
    "it shows a clear spin oscillation under the transverse external magnetic field , which can be well described by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the initial amplitude , @xmath14 is the inhomogeneous transverse electron spin lifetime , @xmath17 stands for the effective electron @xmath1-factor , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the bohr magneton and planck constant , respectively .",
    "@xmath14s extracted from the spin oscillation at 0.82__t _ _ are found to be almost the same as the spin relaxation times measured at zero field .",
    "the magnitude of the extracted electron @xmath17-factor for the four samples falls in the narrow range of 0.46 to 0.48 which is remarkably different from that of bulk inas of about 15 .",
    "the discrepancy of the electron @xmath17 factor in these ultra - thin quantum wells from the bulk value is attributed to the penetration of carrier wave function into the barriers , quantum confinement energy,@xcite and strain@xcite etc .",
    "the lack of inversion symmetry in such iii - v compounds of zinc - blende structures as gaas and inas results in spin splitting of the conduction band via spin - orbit coupling .",
    "spin - orbit coupling contributes a momentum dependent effective magnetic field .",
    "this is the driving force for spin relaxation in dp theory .",
    "the mechanism of the electron spin decoherence occurs via the spin precession of carriers with finite crystal momentum _",
    "k _ caused by the effective _",
    "k_-dependent magnetic field in an inversion - asymmetric material . since spin polarization changes during precession between scatterings , scattering acts against spin relaxation and",
    "accordingly the spin lifetime is inversely proportional to the momentum scattering time @xmath20(namely @xmath21 ) . although strictly speaking that _ k _ is not a good quantum number for submonolayer samples as a result of broken translational symmetry , the mechanism is still good to describe the phenomena observed here .",
    "a signature of this mechanism is that in the motional narrowing regime where spin coherence time greatly exceeds orbital scattering time @xmath20 , cleaner samples are expected to have shorter spin coherence time.@xcite it is naturally expected that scattering by boundaries and deformation potentials will decrease @xmath20 in inas submonolayer samples , where the submonolayer exists in form of disks with lateral size of tens of nanometer and consequently boundaries and deformation potentials are enhanced with the decreased coverage . on the other hand , lateral quantum confinement rising from the reduced lateral dimensions leads to discrete momenta and energy levels , and therefore inhomogous broadending of the electronic states which is an effective decay channel@xcite in 2d system , is gradually suppressed with decreased coverage . in our experiment ,",
    "the electron spin lifetime was found to be significantly increased with the decreased inas submomolayer coverage which leads to a gradually reduced lateral size of the 2d system .",
    "data presented in figure 1 supports the argument that a dimensionally constrained dp mechanism slows down the spin relaxation in the motional narrowing regime .     for ( a ) 1/3 ml and ( b ) 1ml inas samples , respectively , with various pumping density as indicated .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) are the pumping density dependent kerr rotation of 1/3 ml and 1 ml inas samples at @xmath22 _ _ , _ _ respectively .",
    "the temperature is 77 k.,width=321 ]    another important feature we found is that the spin lifetime in the submonolayer inas samples is strongly dependent on carrier density . the kr data for 1/3 ml and 1ml inas ( 001 ) samples at @xmath7=0_t _ and 0.82__t _ _ are shown in figures 2(a ) , 2(b ) , 2(c ) and 2(d ) respectively , with various pumping density as indicated .",
    "in both zero field and transverse external magnetic field cases , one can clearly see that the higher pumping intensity , the faster decay of spin polarization in the 1/3 ml sample .",
    "in contrast , the decay of the spin polarization in the 1ml sample is not that sensitive to the pumping density .      to get more insights into the spin relaxation mechanisms , we plot the derived electron spin decoherence time @xmath14 and the effective @xmath17-factor as a function of carrier density for the three samples on ( 001 ) substrates . in figure 3(a ) , we can find that @xmath14 in both 1/3 and 1/2 ml samples drop quickly as carrier density increases , especially in the low carrier density region ; while that of the 1 ml sample displays weak dependence on carrier density .",
    "we have shown that the spin relaxation by dp mechanism in the submonolayers is suppressed due to the lateral size confinement . the bap mechanism involving electron - hole exchange interaction",
    "may , however , be enhanced or even become dominant in these quantum disk structures because of the strong interaction between the spacially confined photoexcited electrons and holes . the fact that @xmath14decreases with increasing carrier density also agrees well with the expectation of the bap process . as predicted by ref@xcite",
    ", however , it is questioned that the effect of the bap mechanism at low temperature and high electron density is far exaggerated in the literature due to the neglect of the nonlinear terms in the spin - flip electron - hole exchange scattering .    in figure 3(b ) , we plot the carrier density dependence of @xmath17 for three different samples .",
    "the measured @xmath17 through transient kerr rotation should correspond to that at the fermi energy .",
    "it has been found that within a small energy range , the @xmath17-factor can be approximated by @xmath23 , where b denotes a constant and _ e _ denotes the energy.@xcite the electron density of states ( dos ) follows @xmath24 , where _",
    "n _ is the electron density . given a measurement of @xmath17 as a function of electron density , the electron dos at the fermi energy",
    "can therefore be determined by @xmath25 , where _",
    "n _ is the electron density up to the fermi energy . in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) ,",
    "a linear dependence of @xmath17 on the 2deg density is expected , given that the dos of the 2deg is a constant independent of energy.@xcite this expectation agrees well with our experimental results as shown in figure 3(b ) .",
    "as the inas submonolayer exists in form of disks with lateral size of tens of nanometer , the lateral quantum confinement splits the bands and further modifies the dos of the 2degs .",
    "therefore it produces a more rapid change in the @xmath26-factor with electron density .",
    "the observed slight non - linearity of @xmath17at higher density in the submonolayer samples further supports the scenario of lateral quantum confinement .    to carefully identify the spin decoherence mechanism in the submonolayer samples , we have measured temperature dependent kr with various pumping density .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows some of the kr data of the 1/3 ml inas sample at different temperatures measured at b = 0.82__t _ _ with pumping density about 1.5 x 10@xmath27/@xmath11 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the extracted electron spin decoherence time @xmath28 and effective @xmath26-factor are shown in ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath14 of 1/3 ml inas sample with various pumping density as specified is also shown for comparison .",
    "the temperature dependence of the electron spin decoherence time @xmath14 and the effective @xmath1-factor are shown in ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath14 of 1/3 ml inas sample with various pumping density at low temperature as specified is also shown for comparison .",
    ", width=321 ]    bap mechanism predicts spin relaxation time decreases rapidly with increased temperature at low temperature , but is less sensitive to temperature at higher temperature .",
    "the experimental data shown in figure 4(b ) indicates that only the data at low temperature with low pumping intensity ( such as pump / probe=1:1 ) agrees with this dependence .",
    "when the pumping intensity increases ( pump / probe= 3:1 ) , the spin lifetime at low temperature shows flat temperature dependence .",
    "the spin lifetime at higher carrier density ( pump / probe=8:1 ) even displays a peak at around 100 k. these observations clearly demonstrate that the bap mechanism is not the dominant process at higher carrier density or at higher temperature . actually , all the observations could be well explained by zhou and wus calculation@xcite including both bap mechanism and dp mechanism using the kinetic spin bloch equations .",
    "the only discrepancy lies in that the bap mechanism plays a more important role in the submonolayer samples .",
    "the line named bap in figure 4(b ) is a fit of the data at low temperature and low carrier density ( pump / probe=1:1 , pump@xmath29 ) , assuming @xmath30 dependence of the bap mechanism.@xcite    we can find that the dp mechanism will determine the spin relaxation process at high temperature . for the 1ml sample , dp mechanism is believed to dominate at both low temperature and higher temperature .",
    "figure 4(c ) depicts the temperature dependence of the g@xmath31-factor for the three inas samples at pump / probe ratio of 3:1 .",
    "the submonolayer samples exhibit a hump - like dependence of the g@xmath31-factor on temperature ; while the 1ml sample shows a monotonic decrease at elevated temperatures .    in conclusion",
    ", we have experimentally studied the spin relaxation process in inas ultrathin layer embedded in gaas matrix .",
    "long spin relaxation time in the submonolayer structures has been observed and been attributed to the suppression of dp process owing to constriction of lateral dimensions . the electron spin relaxation time and effective @xmath17-factor in submonolayer samples",
    "were found to be strongly dependent on the photon - generated carrier density .",
    "the dependence of spin relaxation on temperature has been examined and the related mechanisms have been discussed .",
    "the clear coherent spin oscillation at 300 k in the inas ultrathin layer seems attractive for coherent spin manipulation at room temperature .",
