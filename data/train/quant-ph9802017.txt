    "the casimir effect @xcite is a surprising phenomenon in which quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in the vacuum , subject to the boundary conditions imposed by two conducting plates of area @xmath0 and separation @xmath1 , lead to an attractive force between them , given by @xmath2 this force , which provides a direct link between quantum field theory and the macroscopic world , has been measured experimentally ( using a torsion pendulum ) between a gold plate , and a gold plated sphere , to the accuracy of within % 5 @xcite .",
    "related fluctuation - induced phenomena occur in various areas of physics ranging from cosmology to statistical mechanics of phase transitions @xcite .    since the pioneering work of casimir , various modifications to the standard boundary conditions have been studied .",
    "one generalization , relevant to experimental measurements of the force , is to introduce deformations ( roughness ) of the surfaces .",
    "for example , in ref.@xcite a multiple scattering approach is used to compute the interactions for arbitrary geometry in a perturbation series in the curvature . in another phenomenological approach , introduced in ref.@xcite ,",
    "small deviations from plane parallel geometry are treated by using an additive summation of van der waals  type pair - wise potentials .",
    "the former method is difficult to implement , while the latter is not always reliable due to the additivity assumption @xcite .",
    "new phenomena emerge for moving boundaries in the generalization to the _ dynamic casimir effect _ @xcite .",
    "the creation of photons by moving mirrors was first obtained by moore@xcite for a 1 dimensional cavity .",
    "fulling and davis@xcite found a corresponding force proportional to the third time derivative of the mirror displacement . their methods specifically make use of the conformal symmetries of the 1 + 1 dimensional space time , and hence are not applicable for the more realistic case of 1 + 3 dimensions @xcite .",
    "another approach to the dynamic casimir effect starts with the fluctuations in the radiation pressure on a plate@xcite .",
    "the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem is then used to obtain the mechanical response function , whose imaginary part gives the dissipation in response to motion .",
    "this method does not suffer from the causality problems of earlier approaches @xcite , and can be applied to all dimensions .",
    "for example , the force in 1 + 3 dimensional space - time depends on the fifth time derivative of the displacement .",
    "several other approaches have focused on the emission of photons by a vibrating cavity @xcite .",
    "this is generally too small to be experimentally detectable @xcite ; the most promising set - up is the resonant production of photons when the mirrors vibrate at the optical resonance frequency of the cavity@xcite .",
    "more recently , the radiation due to vacuum fluctuations of a collapsing bubble has been proposed as a possible explanation for the intriguing phenomenon of sonoluminescense @xcite .",
    "a good review of the topic including more extensive references can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "a number of authors have further discussed to notion of _ frictional forces _ : using conformal methods in 1 + 1 dimensions , ref .",
    "@xcite finds a friction term @xmath3 for slowly moving boundaries , where @xmath4 is a numerical constant that only depends on dimensionality .",
    "the additional factor of @xmath5 would make detection of this force yet more difficult .",
    "there are a few attempts to calculate forces ( in higher dimensions ) for walls that move _ laterally _ , i.e. parallel to each other @xcite : it is found that boundaries that are not ideal conductors , experience a friction as if the plates are moving in a viscous fluid .",
    "the friction has a complicated dependence on the frequency dependent resistivity of the plates , and vanishes in the cases of ideal ( nondissipating ) conductors or dielectrics .",
    "the `` dissipation '' mechanism for this `` friction '' is by inducing eddy currents in the nonideal conductors , and thus distinct from the casimir effect .    in this paper",
    "we present a path integral formulation , applicable to all dimensions , for the problem of perfectly reflecting mirrors that undergo small dynamic deformations .",
    "although the original casimir problem with parallel plates can be tackled with such a path integral approach ( see appendix [ acasimir ] ) , it is much easier to solve by the standard operator method , followed by expansions in modes appropriate to the specified geometry and boundary conditions .",
    "however , if one wishes to study the effect of deformations of either static ( fixed roughness ) or dynamic nature , the standard method is hardly tractable @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the path integral method is much better suited to handling deformations .",
    "the only limitation of the method is that it provides the result as a perturbative expansion in powers of the ratio between the deformation field and the average separation of the plates . in the present context",
    ", a great advantage of this method is that it does not make any distinction between `` time '' and `` space '' coordinates provided that appropriate wick rotations are performed .",
    "consequently , one can consider time dependent boundary conditions with no additional complications .    using this procedure , we calculate the mechanical response function in the frequency  wavevector domain .",
    "it is defined as the ratio between the induced force and the deformation field , in the linear regime .",
    "from the response function we extract a plethora of interesting results , some of which we list here for the specific example of lateral vibrations of uniaxially corrugated plates :    * * ( 1 ) * a single plate with corrugations of wavenumber @xmath6 , vibrating at frequencies @xmath7 , obtains _ anisotropic _ corrections to its mass .",
    "thus the effective mass of a plate depends on its shape ! * * ( 2 ) * for @xmath8 , there is dissipation due to a frequency dependent anisotropic shear viscosity , i.e. a type of ` friction ' in the vacuum . * * ( 3 ) * a second plate at a separation @xmath1 modifies the mass renormalization by a function of @xmath9 , but does not change the dissipation for frequencies @xmath10 . * * ( 4 ) * for all frequencies higher than this first optical normal mode of the cavity , the mechanical response is infinite , implying that such modes can not be excited by any finite external force .",
    "this is intimately connected to the resonant particle creation reported in the literature@xcite .",
    "it is also an example of radiation from neutral bodies , a purely quantum effect .",
    "* * ( 5 ) * a phase angle @xmath11 between two similarly corrugated plates results in josephson  like effects : a static force proportional to @xmath12 , and an oscillating force for a uniform relative velocity . * * ( 6 ) * there is a ( minute ) correction to the velocity of capillary waves on the surface of mercury due to a small change in its surface tension .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sdynamic ] we develop the formalism to calculate the effective action for time dependent small deformation fields . in sec.[skernels ] the behavior of the mechanical response functions are examined in the frequency  wavevector domain .",
    "we discuss the important special case of lateral oscillations of rough plates in sec.[sspecial ] , and sec.[sconclus ] gives the conclusions of the paper , and suggests avenues for future explorations . in appendix [ acasimir ] the path integral method",
    "is applied to the standard casimir effect due to the electromagnetic field , while some details of the calculations are included in appendix [ adetail ] .",
    "in this section we introduce a quantization method for a field , subject to boundary conditions on surfaces which undergo dynamic shape fluctuations .",
    "although one can tackle the gauge invariant electromagnetic vector field by this formalism ( see appendix [ acasimir ] ) , we use for simplicity the `` scalar electrodynamics '' model used most commonly in the literature @xcite .",
    "we consider a scalar field described by the classical action ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 where summation over @xmath15 in a @xmath16 dimensional space - time is understood , and we have made a wick rotation by introducing the imaginary time variable @xmath17 .",
    "we want to quantize the field @xmath18 subject to the constraint that it vanishes on a set of manifolds ( objects ) embedded in space - time .",
    "the manifolds are described by functions @xmath19 ; a @xmath20-dimensional manifold embedded in @xmath16-dimensional space is parametrized by @xmath21 .",

    "the surfaces are thus parametrized by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the deformations .",

    "the corresponding transformations for the kernels result in @xmath55 and @xmath56 where we have performed a rotation of the integration contours from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "the symmetric appearance of the argument @xmath59 in eqs.([kqw ] ) and ( [ qqw ] ) is due to the underlying lorentz invariance of the theory .",
    "finally , the resulting expression for the effective action , defined via @xmath60 , reads @xmath61",
    "the kernels @xmath62 are closely related to the mechanical response of the system . by substituting the expressions of eq.([g4 ] ) in eqs.([kq]-[np ] ) and ( [ kqw],[qqw ] ) , after some manipulations , one obtains @xmath63 }          { 2 \\sqrt{q^2-\\omega^2/c^2 } h s/\\pi}\\right ) g_{\\pm}(s ) ,          \\;\\;\\ ; \\mbox{for\\ $ \\omega < c q$}.   \\label{a+-}\\ ] ] for @xmath64 , the result is obtained by _ analytic continuation _ of the above .",

    ", we shall describe their behavior in various regions of the parameter space .",
    "the kernels can be calculated exactly for a single mirror .",
    "it is simpler to take the @xmath70 limit in the original eqs.([kq]-[g4 ] ) , and ( [ kqw],[qqw ] ) .",
    "additional manipulations lead to @xmath71 , and @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the sign function . while the effective action and the corresponding response are real for @xmath74 , they become purely imaginary for @xmath75 . the analytic continuation to this regime",
    "is not unique .",
    "however , if we require causality for the response , we are led to the choice in which the imaginary part is an odd function , leading to the inclusion of the sign function in the above formula .",
    "an imaginary response function signals dissipation of energy @xcite , presumably by creation of photons as shown in the next section @xcite . for the special case of @xmath76 , eq.([a+infty ] ) agrees with the results obtained previously@xcite for flat mirrors .",
    "( note that ref.@xcite considers the electromagnetic field rather than a scalar field , accounting for the discrepancy in the numerical prefactor .",
    "we have also done the same calculations in 1 + 1 dimensions and have reproduced the result of refs.@xcite , who also use scalar fields , with the correct coefficient . )    in the presence of a second plate ( i.e. for finite @xmath1 ) , the situation is more complicated . for @xmath74 , we can examine the behavior of the integrand in eq.([a+- ] ) and find that the kernels are _ real _ and _ finite _ in this regime .",
    "however , for @xmath75 the situation is different . applying contour integration , we can transform the integral in eq.([a+- ] ) to the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the contribution from the semicircle at infinity .",
    "the residues can be easily shown to be finite and real , and add to up to a finite and well behaved sum .",
    "examining the contributions from the semicircle at infinity , we find terms with both real and imaginary parts , that generically behave as @xmath79/[k(l / h)^3]$ ] , with @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath82 is the radius of the semicircle , presumably corresponding to an upper cut - off in space - time .",
    "now we can see that in the limit @xmath83 , the situation drastically changes at @xmath84 . while @xmath78 vanishes for @xmath85",
    ", it diverges with both real and imaginary parts for @xmath86 , where the inequality is understood in its strict sense .    to summarize ,",
    "we can subdivide the parameter space of the kernels into three different regions , as depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "in region i ( @xmath74 for any @xmath1 ) , the kernels are finite and real , and hence there is no dissipation . in region",
    "iia where @xmath87 , the @xmath1-independent part of @xmath88 is imaginary , while the @xmath1-dependent parts of both kernels are real and finite .",
    "( this is also the case at the boundary @xmath89 . )",
    "the dissipation in this regime is simply the sum of what would have been observed if the individual plates were decoupled , and unrelated to the separation @xmath1 .",
    "by contrast , in region iib where @xmath90 , both kernels diverge with infinite real and imaginary parts .",
    "this @xmath1-dependent divergence extends all the way to the negative @xmath91 axis , where it is switched off by a @xmath92 prefactor .",
    "note that some care is necessary in the order of limits for @xmath93 .",
    "divergence of the kernels might be argued to signal a breakdown of the perturbation theory .",
    "however , one should note that the exponential divergence of the kernels is an essential singularity that can not be `` cured '' by standard renormalization techniques .",
    "it is in fact an artifact of the unphysical assumption of perfect reflectivity for the mirrors at _ all _ frequencies .",
    "any natural frequency cut - off for the reflectivity of the mirror will round off this divergence @xcite , leading to a finite mechanical response . in other words ,",
    "the imperfection in reflectivity at low frequencies provides a leakage mechanism for the cavity that stops the resonant energy build - up .",
    "exponential creation of photons ( with observation time ) for perfectly reflecting boundaries has also been reported in the literature for the case of a one dimensional cavity @xcite , using a completely different approach .",
    "we now concentrate on a concrete example , and examine the lateral vibrations of surfaces with fixed ( time independent ) roughness , such as two corrugated plates .",
    "we assume that the first plate undergoes a lateral motion described by @xmath94 , while the second plate is stationary .",
    "the deformations of the plates are thus described by @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the lateral force exerted on the first plate is obtained from @xmath97 . using eq.([seff ] ) , and within linear response , this is given by @xmath98 where the `` mechanical response tensor '' is @xmath99\\;|h_1({\\bf q})|^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } a_{-}(q,0 ) \\left(h_1({\\bf q})h_2(-{\\bf q})+h_1(-{\\bf q } ) h_2({\\bf q})\\right ) \\right\\ } , \\label{rough}\\ ] ] and there is a residual ( static ) force @xmath100 we can calculate the dissipation rate @xmath101 in which we have used the fact that real ( imaginary ) part of a response function is an even ( odd ) function of frequency . using the above formulas , we can predict various interesting effects for corrugated plates , that appear due to quantum fluctuations of vacuum .      for a single corrugated plate ,",
    "whose deformation is defined as @xmath102 , one can easily calculate the response tensor using the explicit formulas in eq.([a+infty ] ) . in the low - frequency limit , i.e. when @xmath103 , we can expand the result in powers of @xmath68 .",
    "this gives @xmath104 , where @xmath105 , and can be regarded as corrections to the mass of the plate @xcite .",
    "( cut - off dependent mass corrections also appear , as in ref . @xcite . )",
    "note that these mass corrections are _ anisotropic _ , with @xmath106 parallel and perpendicular components are defined with respect to @xmath6 , and @xmath0 denotes the area of the plates .",
    "the mass correction is proportional to @xmath107 , and hence inherently very small .",
    "for example , if we have a macroscopic sample with @xmath108 mm , density @xmath109 , and thickness @xmath110 mm , we find @xmath111 . even for deformations of a microscopic sample of atomic dimensions ( close to the limits of the applicability of our continuum representations of the boundaries ) ,",
    "@xmath112 can only be reduced to around @xmath113 .",
    "while the actual changes in mass are immeasurably small , the hope is that its _ anisotropy _ may be more accessible , say by comparing oscillation frequencies of a corrugated plate in two orthogonal directions .    for @xmath8 , which is the high - frequency limit",
    ", the response function is imaginary , and we can define a frequency dependent effective shear viscosity by @xmath114 . this viscosity is also anisotropic , with @xmath115 note that in 1 + 3 dimensions the dissipation is proportional to the fifth time derivative of displacement , and there is no dissipation for a uniformly accelerating plate .",
    "however , a freely oscillating plate will undergo a damping of its motion .",
    "the characteristic decay time for a plate of mass @xmath37 is @xmath116 . for the macroscopic plate of the previous paragraph ,",
    "vibrating at a frequency of @xmath117 ( in the @xmath118hz range ) , the decay time is enormous , @xmath119s .",
    "however , since the decay time scales as the fifth power of the dimension , it can be reduced to @xmath120s , for plates of order of 10 atoms .",
    "however , the required frequencies in this case ( in the @xmath121hz range ) are very large .",
    "also note that for the linearized forms to remain valid in this high frequency regime , we must require very small amplitudes , so that the typical velocities involved @xmath122 , are smaller than the speed of light .",
    "these difficulties can be somewhat overcome by considering resonant dissipation in the presence of a second plate .      with two plates at an average distance @xmath1 , the results are qualitatively the same for frequencies less than the natural resonance of the resulting cavity .",
    "there is a renormalization of mass in region i , and dissipation appears in region iia , of fig .  1 .",
    "however , the mass renormalization at low frequencies ( @xmath7 ) is now a function of both @xmath123 and @xmath1 , with a crossover from the single plate behavior for @xmath124 . in the limit of @xmath125",
    ", we obtain @xmath126 with @xmath127 \\approx -0.452448.\\ ] ] compared to the single plate , there is an enhancement by a factor of @xmath128 in @xmath129 .",
    "the effective dissipation in region iia is simply the sum of those due to individual plates , and contains no @xmath1 dependence .",
    "there are additional interesting phenomena resulting from resonances .",
    "we find that both real and imaginary parts of @xmath62 , diverge for @xmath130 , that corresponds to region iib of fig .  1 .",
    "in the example of corrugated plates , we replace @xmath131 by @xmath123 to obtain a continuous spectrum of frequencies with diverging dissipation .",
    "( note that the imaginary part of the response function gives the dissipation . )",
    "related effects have been reported in the literature for 1 + 1 dimensions@xcite , but occuring at a _",
    "discrete _ set of frequencies @xmath132 with integer @xmath133 .",
    "these resonances occur when the frequency of the external perturbation matches the natural normal modes of the cavity , thus exciting quanta of such modes . in one space dimension ,",
    "these modes are characterized by a discrete set of wavevectors that are integer multiples of @xmath134 .",
    "the restriction to @xmath133 is a consequence of quantum electrodynamics being a ` free ' theory ( quadratic action ) : only two - photon states can be excited subject to conservation of energy .",
    "thus the sum of the frequencies of the two photons should add up to the external frequency@xcite .    in higher dimensions ,",
    "the appropriate parameter is the combination @xmath135 . from the perspective of the excited photons , conservation of momentum",
    "requires that their two momenta add up to @xmath131 , while energy conservation restricts the sum of their frequencies to @xmath68 .",
    "the in - plane momentum @xmath131 , introduces a continuous degree of freedom : the resonance condition can now be satisfied for a continuous spectrum , in analogy with optical resonators . in ref.@xcite , the lowest resonance frequency is found to be @xmath136 which seems to contradict our prediction .",
    "however , the absence of @xmath137 in 1 + 1 d is due to a vanishing prefactor@xcite , which is also present in our calculations .",
    "however , in exploring the continuous frequency spectrum in higher dimensions , this single point is easily bypassed , and there is a divergence for all frequencies satisfying @xmath130 , where the inequality holds in its strict sense .",
    "resonant dissipation has profound consequences for motion of plates .",
    "it implies that due to quantum fluctuations of vacuum , _ components of motion with frequencies in the range of divergences can not be generated by any finite external force _ !",
    "the imaginary parts of the kernels are proportional to the total number of excited photons @xcite . exciting these degrees of motion",
    "must be accompanied by the generation of an infinite number of photons ; requiring an infinite amount of energy , and thus impossible . however , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the divergence is rounded off by assuming finite reflectivity and transmissivity for the mirrors .",
    "hence , in practice , the restriction is softened and controlled by the degree of ideality of the mirrors in the frequency region of interest .",

    "this should be regarded as a correction to the static casimir force due to the deformations of the plates .",
    "the dependence on the sine of the phase mismatch is reminiscent of the dc josephson current in superconductor junctions , the force playing a role analogous to the current .",
    "( the amplitudes @xmath145 and @xmath146 are similar to the wave functions in sis junctions . )",
    "note that we could have equally well obtained this result using the constant term in eq.([fi0w ] ) .    for uniform motion , there is an analog for the ac josephson effect , with velocity ( the variable conjugate to force ) playing the role of voltage . setting @xmath147",
    ", we find @xmath148 , \\label{josephsonac}\\ ] ] where @xmath149 , with @xmath150 a ( dimensionless ) slowly varying function of its argument .",
    "note that the force oscillates at a frequency @xmath151 .",
    "actually both effects are a consequence of the attractive nature of the casimir force . it would be difficult to separate them from similar forces resulting from say , van der waals attractions .",
    "one difference with ( non - retarded ) van der waals force is in the power - law fall - off .",
    "another potential difference with additive attractive interactions may be in the angular dependence of a static force .",
    "such a difference in angular dependence due to the non - additive nature of thermal fluctuation - induced forces is discussed in refs.@xcite for two rods on a membrane .",
    "it is also likely to occur if we examine two rod - shaped deformations on the two plates in the casimir geometry .",
    "in addition to solid corrugated plates , we can examine deformations of fluid surfaces .",
    "for example , consider the capillary waves on the surface of mercury , with a conducting plate placed at a separation @xmath1 above the surface .",
    "the low frequency  wavevector expansion of the kernel due to quantum fluctuations in the intervening vacuum starts with quadratic forms @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "these terms result in corrections to the ( surface ) mass density by @xmath154 , and to the surface tension by @xmath155 ( @xmath156 is the numerical constant calculated in eq.([b ] ) ) .",
    "the latter correction is larger by a factor of @xmath157 , and changes the velocity @xmath158 , of capillary waves by @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the bare surface tension of mercury .",
    "taking @xmath161 mm and @xmath162 dynes / cm , we find another very small correction of @xmath163 .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a path integral formulation for the study of quantum fluctuations in a cavity with dynamically deforming boundaries .",
    "as opposed to previous emphasis on spectra of emitted radiation , we focus on the mechanical response of the vacuum from which we extract a variety of interesting mechanical effects .",
    "most of the predicted dynamic casimir phenomena , while quite intriguing theoretically , appear to be beyond the reach of current experiment : the most promising candidates are the anisotropy in mass , and resonant dissipation .",
    "a major difficulty is the necessity of exciting deformation modes of macroscopic objects in the @xmath118hz or higher frequency range .",
    "however , as the static casimir effect seems more amenable to current experiments @xcite , it would be interesting to test the non - additive nature of this force for plates with rod - shaped deformations .",
    "the path integral method is quite versatile : it is better suited to treating deformed boundaries than other techniques , such as that of ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover , unlike other approaches @xcite , it provides the dispersive part of the response , as well as its dissipative part .",
    "furthermore , we can envision a number of future extensions based on this formalism , some of which are listed below :    1 .",
    "it is worthwhile to repeat the calculations for electromagnetic gauge fields .",
    "while we expect the above results to remain qualitatively unchanged , the vector nature of em field , as well its gauge symmetry , may lead to novel additional phenomena .",
    "the transversality of photons in vacuum , as well differences between transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) modes , are two examples of the difference with scalar field , and may be important when considering the spectrum of emitted radiation ( see below ) .",
    "there have been some efforts to calculate the spectrum of radiation emitted from a single fluctuating mirror , or by a cavity with fluctuating walls @xcite .",
    "our formalism allows calculations in the more realistic case of 3 + 1 dimensional undulating walls .",
    "( presumably , it is simpler to excite surface deformations of the boundaries at high frequencies , rather than rigidly oscillating the wall as a whole . )",
    "radiation spectra can be obtained from two - point correlation functions which may be calculated by extending the methods of this paper .",
    "hopefully , the angular distribution of the spectrum will provide signatures that can help in the experimental detection of such weak radiation .",
    "3 .    new issues can be probed by extending the calculation to the next order in the deformation fields .",
    "for example , new dissipative terms may arise at the second order , resulting in a ` viscosity ' proportional to the velocity - squared as in eq.([frictionforce ] ) .",
    "4 .   as in ref.@xcite",
    ", it is possible to examine other geometries such as fluctuating 1 and 2 dimensional manifolds , corresponding respectively to world - lines of a point particle and a wire in space - time .",
    "we can then use our techniques to calculate the dynamic casimir forces involved for fluctuating wires , and mutual interactions between moving particles , wires , and surfaces .",
    "dielectric superlattices are artificial media with nontrivial optical properties@xcite .",
    "because of the dielectric contrast in photonic crystals , they are excellent candidates for casimir effects . in particular , dimensional arguments suggest that a photonic crystal with lattice spacing @xmath164 , will receive a density enhancement ( presumably anisotropic ) of the order of @xmath165 .",
    "while this is at best many orders of magnitude smaller than a typical density , it is none - the - less interesting to calculate the associated corrections to the mass tensor .",
    "it is more promising to examine the coupling of the vibrations of such superlattices to their optimal properties . in particular , do mechanical deformations ( phonons ) modify the optical function of a photonic crystal , due to quantum fluctuations of the vacuum ? 6 .",
    "an important generalization is to replace the assumption of perfectly metallic walls with boundary conditions that describe more realistic dielectric functions .",
