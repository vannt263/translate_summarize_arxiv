    "the discovery of neutrino masses or oscillations would take particle physics beyond its standard model , and therefore requires very stringent standards of proof and verification . moreover , neutrino experiments are difficult , and their history is littered with unconfirmed claims .",
    "therefore , one must be cautious in accepting new experimental results , and should demand that they fulfil stringent credibility criteria . in my personal view",
    "@xcite , these should include confirmation by more than one experiment , using more than one technique .",
    "these criteria are obeyed by solar neutrino experiments , since five experiments ( homestake , kamiokande , sage , gallex , super - kamiokande ) see a deficit using 3@xmath1 different techniques ( cl , h@xmath20 , ga with two extraction schemes )  @xcite .",
    "now they are also obeyed by atmospheric neutrino experiments : five experiments ( kamiokande , imb , super - kamiokande , soudan ii , macro ) see anomalies using two different classes of technique ( h@xmath2o , tracking calorimetry )  @xcite . therefore , i take these results very seriously as evidence for new physics . on the other hand , only one accelerator experiment ( lsnd ) sees an anomaly  @xcite , using _ a fortiori _ just one technique ( liquid scintillator ) .",
    "therefore , i prefer to adopt a wait - and - see attitude to this result , eagerly awaiting its confirmation by another experiment such as karmen or miniboone  @xcite .    in the general perception , the case for atmospheric neutrino oscillations has recently leap - frogged over that of solar neutrinos .",
    "this is largely because , in addition to the sheer number of experiments reporting @xmath3 deficits , the super - kamiokande collaboration has reported dramatic effects in the zenith - angle distributions  @xcite , where many systematic errors cancel  @xcite .",
    "moreover , both low- and high - energy data show compatible effects , indicating that the @xmath4 ratio decreases as @xmath5 increases , just as expected if @xmath3 oscillate into @xmath6 or perhaps a sterile neutrino @xmath7 .    in the case of solar neutrinos ,",
    "the overall deficit has been confirmed by super - kamiokande with higher statistics  @xcite , but no comparable  smoking gun \" for neutrino oscillations has yet appeared .",
    "there is a hint of a day - night difference  @xcite , but its significance remains below two standard deviations , and there is also a hint of an distortion of the energy spectrum  @xcite , but a constant suppression is still compatible with the data at the few - percent confidence level .    before launching into the theory of neutrino masses , it is useful to review why the oscillation hypothesis is being pursued to the exclusion of other possible explanations . in the case of atmospheric neutrinos , most neutrino decay scenarios are excluded  @xcite , flavour - changing interactions with matter are highly disfavoured  @xcite , and violations of lorentz invariance and the principle of equivalence are disfavoured by the pattern of zenith - angle distributions at low and high energies  @xcite . in the case of solar neutrinos ,",
    "the standard solar model is strongly supported by the helioseismological data  @xcite , which do not allow substantial changes in the solar equation of state , and previous claims of a time dependence associated with the solar cycle have not been established .",
    "if these are non - zero , they must be much smaller than those of the corresponding charged leptons  @xcite : m__e 2.5  ev  , m _ _ 160  kev  , m _ _ 15  ev  , [ one ] so one might think naively that they should vanish entirely . however , theorists believe that particle masses can be strictly zero only if there is a corresponding conserved charge associated with an exact gauge symmetry , which is not the case for lepton number . indeed , non - zero neutrino masses appear generically in grand unified theories ( guts )  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not necessary to postulate new particles to get @xmath8 : these could be generated by a non - renormalizable interaction among standard model particles  @xcite : [ two ] where @xmath9 is some new , heavy mass scale .",

    "but if so , what is to prevent them from acquiring large masses : @xmath17 with @xmath18 , as for the @xmath10 discussed above ? in the absence of some new theoretical superstructure , this is an important objection to simply postulating light @xmath7 or @xmath10 .",

    "+   + _ large mixing ? _ : small neutrino mixing used perhaps to be favoured , by analogy with the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing of quarks .",

    "then , even if @xmath25 , we have no independent evidence that mixing is small in the lepton sector . finally , even if @xmath26 were to be approximately diagonal in the same flavour basis as the charged leptons @xmath27 , why should this also be the same case for the heavy majorana matrix @xmath28  @xcite ?",
    "since @xmath29 to @xmath30 ev @xmath31 to @xmath32 ev ( msw solution  @xcite ) or @xmath33  ev ( vacuum solution ) , one may ask whether large neutrino mixing is compatible with a hierarchy of neutrino masses . to feel more comfortable about this possibility , consider the following very simple parametrization of the inverse of a 2@xmath222 neutrino mass matrix  @xcite : m^-1 _ ( ) = d ( ) [ five ] diagonalizing this , one finds mixing : ^2 2= 4 d^2(b - c)^2 + 4d^2 [ six ] which is large if @xmath34 .",

    "this seems very likely : for example , in the flipped su(5 ) model  @xcite that yields ( [ nine ] ) for the dirac neutrino mass matrix , one also finds m ~ ( ) [ thirteen ] for the heavy majorana mass matrix , where all the non - zero entries @xmath57 could be comparable , and plausibly of order @xmath58 gev , as required by the see - saw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the small - angle msw solution would then appear , possibly , to be disfavoured .    before leaving this section , it is useful to record the general form of the 3@xmath223 neutrino mixing matrix  @xcite : ( ) = ( ) ( ) ( ) [ forteen ] which includes two cp - violating majorana phases @xmath59 as well as three mixing angles @xmath60 and one cp - violating phase @xmath61 as in the quark case",

    "no day - night effect is expected in the case of vacuum oscillations , which may eventually turn into a problem if the current trend is confirmed .",
    "a third tool that may soon supply some discriminating power is the seasonal variation . in the case of the small - angle msw solution",

    "in the previous sections , we have reviewed the various strong pieces of evidence for possible new neutrino physics beyond the standard model , which are certainly highly indicative of neutrino masses and oscillations .",

    "the wealth of new data  particularly from super - kamiokande  @xcite  is highly suggestive of neutrino masses and oscillations , for both solar and atmospheric neutrinos . in both cases ,",
    "some definitive experiments are at hand . in the case of solar neutrinos , these include sno ( to see if b neutrinos have oscillated into some other flavour ) , borexino ( to see if be neutrinos have oscillated strongly ) , and kamland ( to test the large - mixing - angle msw hypothesis using the known flux of reactor neutrinos ) .",
    "meanwhile , super - kamiokande is progressing towards decisive measurements of the spectrum distortion , the day - night effect and the seasonal variation of the solar neutrino flux . in the case of atmospheric neutrinos",
    ", @xmath109 production and the zenith - angle distribution may soon provide decisive discrimination betwen the @xmath104 and @xmath102 scenarios . in this case",
    ", the definitive measurements will be made by long - baseline neutrino beams from accelerators , starting with k2k .",
    "these have an extensive programme of work ahead of them , including measurements of @xmath3 disappearance and the neutral current / charged current ratio , as well as @xmath117 and @xmath6 appearance experiments . the detailed measurements possible with controlled accelerator beams will dissipate any remaining doubts about the interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino experiments .    in the longer run , the concept of a neutrino factory based on a muon storage ring offers the prospect of a complete set of oscillation measurements with separated neutrino flavours and charges , including the possibility of very - long - baseline experiments and a quest for cp violation .",
    "this option also offers other exciting opportunities in @xmath126 and @xmath0 physics , as well as serving as a stepping - stone towards higgs factories and a high - energy @xmath147 collider . as never before , neutrino physics is entering , and perhaps diverting , the mainstream of particle physics .",
