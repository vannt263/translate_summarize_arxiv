    "galaxy clusters are the largest virialized arrangements of dark matter and baryons in the universe .",
    "most of the baryons in clusters reside not in galaxies , but in hot , diffuse atmospheres that are easily detected in the x - ray band .",
    "x - ray atmospheres are confined by deep gravitational wells , so catalogs of x - ray - selected clusters are nearly insensitive to false concentrations of galaxies projected along the line of sight . furthermore , x - ray luminosities provide a reliable estimate of cluster mass . for these and other reasons ,",
    "x - ray cluster surveys are ideally suited for selecting and studying the systematic properties of clusters and their galaxy populations ( rosati , borgani , & norman 2002 ) .",
    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) reside near the x - ray centroid where a cooling flow ( cool core ) is often found ( fabian 1994 ) .",
    "a cooling flow is characterized by a bright , central cusp of x - ray emission from gas with a radiative cooling time that is shorter than @xmath8 .",
    "bcgs centered in strong cooling flows usually harbor bright nebular emission , star formation , and cold molecular gas ( heckman et al . 1989 ; edge 2001 ; salom & combes 2003 ; donahue et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the connection between cold gas , star formation , and cooling flows has been strengthened by the recent discovery of a star formation threshold in bcgs .",
    "high star formation rates and bright nebular emission are found preferentially in bcgs centered in atmospheres with central cooling times shorter than @xmath9 gyr ( rafferty et al .",
    "2008 , cavagnolo et al .",
    "2008 , hudson et al . 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , the presence or absence of nebular emission in bcgs signals the presence or absence of an active cluster cooling flow ( see also edwards et al .",

    "when no obvious bcg could be identified , the galaxy with the brightest spectral continuum was considered the bcg .",
    "of the 155 long slit spectra available from the 160sd survey ( 45 of the 200 cluster redshifts were found in the literature ) , 77 bcg spectra were sufficiently sensitive for this study .",

    "we follow a sign convention where emission lines have negative equivalent widths , and absorption lines have positive equivalent widths .",
    "the continuum was measured using adjacent sidebands redward and blueward of the feature bandwidth .",
    "a linear fit was applied across the continuum sidebands .",
    "feature bandwidths and continuum sidebands are listed in table[table : widths ] @xcite . the sidebands were placed in close proximity to the feature to avoid differential extinction and continuum flux calibration uncertainty , and to avoid strong absorption or emission features .",
    "the full spectra have not been corrected for line - of - sight extinction .",
    "local extinction corrections to the emission line upper limit measurements have been applied .",
    "emission lines emerging from warm ionized gas are expected to be doppler broadened due to their motions in the center of the galaxy .",
    "doppler broadened and emission lines in cooling flow bcgs have velocity widths lying between @xmath34@xcite .",
    "sampling dictates that a minimum of 3 pixels be included at the line position for each equivalent width measurement . for our minimum dispersion of 3.42",
    ", the minimum achievable line sampling corresponds to 497 at and 818 at . at our maximum dispersion 1.44 , velocity widths approaching 264for and 450 for  can be resolved . our velocity width coverage for lies between @xmath35 and @xmath36  for .",
    "our spectra are therefore reasonably well matched to the expected gas velocity spread in these systems .",
    "the estimated uncertainty in the equivalent width measurements assume that the standard deviation of the best linear fit to the continuum is equal to the uncertainty at the line center .",
    "the uncertainties given in table 2 are 1@xmath37 standard deviation of the best linear fit .",
    "the spectral index , @xmath38 , is the ratio of the flux of the molecular band to the interpolated continuum flux in magnitudes @xcite .",
    "we include a measurement of @xmath38 for the molecular band ( mgh + mg @xmath39 ) to compare our bcgs to local giant elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the molecular and continuum bandwidths for are listed in table[table : widths ] . to estimate the continuum ,",
    "the average flux of each continuum sideband was used to interpolate across the molecular bandwidth @xcite .",
    "the spectral index was measured using the following expression :    @xmath40    in this expression , @xmath41 is the mean flux of the molecular bandwidth , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the estimated mean fluxes of the continuum bandwidths , @xmath44 is the wavelength at the bandwidth center , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the wavelengths at the center of the continuum bandwidths @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the spectral index measurement was estimated by applying the method of partial derivative error propagation and is presented in table 3 as the @xmath47 error estimate .",
    "though they were selected using similar x - ray criteria , the bcgs in this sample lie , for the most part , at higher redshifts than those in the crawford et al .",
    "( 1999 ) sample of bcgs drawn from the @xmath0 brightest cluster survey .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to compare key line indices for our galaxies to those for crawford s galaxies and to nearby giant ellipticals @xcite with similar luminosities and linear aperture sizes to identify any gross differences in their stellar populations . in figure[fig : mg2 ] we present a histogram of the distribution of  indices for our sample .",
    "our sample yields a mean of @xmath48 . in comparison",
    ", we found the mean mg2 strength of the crawford et al .",

    "65% lie within the range of local ges , and 97% lie within 1@xmath37  of the mean .",
    "our mg2 strengths are also consistent with those for ges in the sloan digital sky survey ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ) .",

    "the range of for the @xcite sample is @xmath300.42.8 , while the mean of our sample is @xmath50 .",

    "an issue associated with this analysis concerns the effect of metallicity gradients on our line strength measurements .",
    "it is well known that the mean stellar metallicity in ge galaxies and bcgs generally declines with radius .",
    "this implies that for a fixed slit aperture , the observed spectrum of a distant galaxy extends to larger radii compared to a nearby galaxy . as a consequence",
    ", the stellar populations in the most distant galaxies will appear to have lower mean metallicities .",
    "the upper - right panel of figure [ fig : abs ] shows the relationship between  and redshift for the sample .",
    "the plot of  versus @xmath51 shows no trend toward declining line strength in more distant galaxies .",
    "therefore , we find no discernible aperture - based metallicity bias within our sample .",
    "the upshot of this analysis is that we detect no gross anomalies in the two absorption line indices studied here that would indicate the presence of unusual stellar populations in our bcgs with respect to our comparison sample and normal local giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "emission lines of and trace cooler gas that has been ionized by hot , young stars and an active nucleus .",
    "the emission - line is sensitive to low levels of ionized gas because of its intrinsic strength and high contrast against the declining stellar uv continuum .",
    "however , measuring can be challenging given the local sensitivity to metallicity and the declining sensitivity of ccd detectors in the near uv @xcite .",
    "because the signal - to - noise ratios of our spectra were optimized for redshift measurements and not for the detection of _ weak _ line emission , we shall restrict our discussions to galaxies of moderate to high emission line strengths , which would be easily detected .",
    "we have chosen to present our upper limits primarily in the form of equivalent widths , rather than line luminosity for practical reasons .",
    "first , equivalent width is a differential quantity that can be measured accurately and independently of the flux calibration .",
    "because our spectra were taken over several years and with three different instruments , equivalent width measurements avoid any systematic differences in flux calibration between the various observing runs .",
    "second , crawford et al . ( 1999 ) presents line luminosities for the objects they detected , but they do not present upper limits . therefore , a direct comparison between the two samples in luminosity would not be feasible . furthermore , nebular line emission is often spatially extended , and comparisons between line luminosities would be hampered by unknown aperture corrections .",
    "equivalent widths , being differential quantities are less affected .",
    "crawford et al . ( 1995 ) presented equivalent widths for a large number of their objects , which allowed us to convert their line luminosities to equivalent widths for the purpose of this comparison .",
    "figure [ fig : em ] shows the equivalent widths of   and  as a function of redshift . for objects below redshift @xmath52 , the feature falls in a noisy region near the edge of the wavelength coverage of the spectrum .",
    "for this reason , 16 measurements were excluded from figure [ fig : em ] .",
    "similarly , measurements of for nine galaxies with redshifts above @xmath53 have been omitted from figure [ fig : em ] because they fall outside of the wavelength coverage of the spectra .",

    "no significant emission stronger than @xmath64 or emission stronger than @xmath59 has been detected in any bcg in our sample .",
    "the absence of strong line emission in any 160sd bcg is surprising .",
    "the strongest emission lines seen in cooling flow bcgs have   equivalent widths that are significantly greater than our upper limits .",

    "the left panel of figure [ fig : fluxcomp ] compares the x - ray luminosities of crawford s bcs clusters ( indicated as  + \" ) to our sample ( indicated by  @xmath73 \" ) versus redshift .",
    "we have multiplied the 160sd x - ray luminosities in this figure by the factor 1.7 to reflect the passband difference between bcs luminosities and ours .",
    "figure [ fig : fluxcomp ] shows that the highest bcs x - ray luminosities at roughly @xmath74 exceed the most luminous 160sd cluster by about five times .",
    "nevertheless , there is substantial overlap in the x - ray luminosities of clusters from both surverys .",
    "apart from a few low luminosity clusters , we find that at a fixed x - ray luminosity , the 160sd clusters lie at higher redshifts compared to their bcs counterparts .",

    "crawford et al . found a roughly constant detection frequency of line emitting bcgs with redshift and luminosity @xcite .",
    "accordingly , this diagram shows many line emitting bcgs in clusters with comparable x - ray luminosities to 160sd clusters .",
    "therefore , the absence of line emission in 160sd bcgs is not entirely due to their association with lower luminosity clusters .",
    "one distinguishing characteristic is that bcs clusters of a given x - ray luminosity lie at lower redshifts compared to their 160sd counterparts .",
    "we explore this below .",

    "the second row shows detections stronger than @xmath75 for and respectively , while the bottom row shows detections stronger than @xmath76 .    in order to make this comparison , we converted crawford s emission line luminosities to equivalent widths .",
    "the conversion was made using several bcgs with line fluxes from @xcite found in common with measurements from @xcite .",
    "the average ratio of equivalent width to flux was multiplied by the line flux reported by @xcite for each line emitting bcg .",
    "these ratios are 5.2@xmath772.6 for   and 9.7@xmath774.5 for . of the 177 bcs clusters presented by @xcite ,",
    "10 were omitted from figure [ fig : comp ] because their x - ray luminosities were unavailable to us . of these , four bcgs have in emission and two have in emission . excluding these objects ,",

    "thirty four percent of emission - line bcgs and 43% of emission - line bcgs show equivalent widths stronger than @xmath76 .",
    "the nebular emission detection thresholds for the bcs shown in figure [ fig : comp ] lie comfortably above ours .",

    "this figure shows that at a given redshift , bcs clusters have higher average x - ray luminosities .    about",

    "the fraction falls to 18% within the x - ray luminosity range @xmath80 .",
    "similarly , 16% of clusters with x - ray luminosities within the range @xmath81 have emission lines .",
    "these figures show that while higher luminosity clusters show a higher frequency of emission line bcgs , the lower average x - ray luminosity of the 160sd sample can not alone explain the absence of strong line emission .",
    "table [ tab : emcomp ] summarizes the detection statistics for both surveys . assuming both samples are equally likely to have bcgs with bright line emission within the overlapping luminosity range",
    ", the table shows that we should have detected line emission in roughly one dozen 160sd bcgs with h@xmath82 equivalent widths greater than @xmath83  , and with [ o ii ] widths exceeding @xmath84  .",
    "the probability of having detected one or fewer emission line bcgs by chance is approximately one in ten thousand .",
    "eight percent of bcs clusters within our x - ray luminosity range host bcgs with line equivalent widths stronger than @xmath84  .",
    "we would have expected to detect about 6 such systems in our sample ( figure 8 , panel 3 ) , yet we detected none .",
    "the likelihood of having detected one or fewer such system by chance is less than @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the absence of line emitting bcgs in the 160sd survey is statistically significant at a high level .",
    "a potential systematic effect that could bias our equivalent widths downward is beam dilution owing to larger projected linear aperture sizes with increasing redshift .",
    "crawford et al . used a slit width of approximately 1.2 arcsec , which is somewhat smaller than ours .",
    "crawford s clusters lie on average at lower redshifts , so that their slit width projects over a several kpc on the galaxy . in comparison ,",
    "our slits subtended a linear width of between @xmath86 kpc between redshifts of 0.3 and 0.5 .",
    "furthermore , crawford integrated along the slit out to a typical linear distance of about 10 kpc , while we integrated along the slit to the approximate location where the galaxy brightness falls below the sky brightness , which is @xmath87 times larger in radius .",
    "because of the larger fraction of galaxy light in our aperture compared to crawford s , our equivalent may be diluted with respect to theirs .",
    "we have estimated the magnitude of the effect by modeling the light profile of our galaxies with a hubble law , ie . , stellar surface brightness declining radially as @xmath88 , and integrating the stellar light beyond the central 10 kpc down to the sky limit .",
    "we found that the effect would bias our equivalent widths downward by at most @xmath89 with respect to crawford s .",
    "in other words , it is possible that an object with @xmath90 equivalent width of @xmath91   would fall below our @xmath2   cutoff because of aperture dilution .",
    "however , the _ detection _ of stronger features is not in jeopardy .",
    "in fact , an upper limit on the magnitude of the effect can be evaluated directly by scanning the line luminosity upper limits for the most distant objects shown in table 2 , which would show the largest effects .",
    "these upper limits lie below @xmath92 . in comparison , the objects that are putatively missing from our sample",
    "would have line luminosities lying between @xmath92 and @xmath93",
    ". they would easily have been detected .",
    "in fact , crawford s smaller aperture will have missed flux from spatially extended emission line systems that we would have captured .",
    "many emission line systems in cooling flows , such as perseus , extend 30 kpc or more from the nucleus ( heckman et al .",
    "1989 , odea et al .",
    "therefore , a dilution effect will be most pronounced in weak emission line galaxies with small , unresolved nebulae , which we are not concerned with in this paper .    while the detectability of strong emission lines is not at issue",
    ", our primary concern is whether the x - ray selection functions in the 160sd and rass surveys are oppositely biased toward the non detection and detection of cooling flow clusters in each respective survey . in a study of 10 bcgs from the 160sd survey with x - ray luminosities below @xmath94 [ 0.12.4 kev ]",
    ", @xcite also failed to detect line emission in any bcg .",
    "they argued that the 160sd survey is biased against clusters with strong cooling flows because only extended sources at a faint x - ray flux limit were sought .",
    "this interpretation is incorrect .",
    "if the 160sd survey is biased , we would expect it to contain an excessive number of cooling flows .",
    "the central @xmath95 kpc or so of cooling flow clusters are brighter than normal clusters .",
    "they are well resolved in the 160sd survey , and are thus easier to detect than non - cooling flow clusters ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "1998 , burenin et al . 2007 ) .",
    "simulations have shown that the detection probability declines precipitously only for clusters harboring x - ray - bright agn near their centers , and only in the rare event that the agn outshines the cluster emission ( burenin et al .",
    "such clusters are rare at these redshifts .",
    "figure 7 shows that clusters of a given x - ray luminosity in the bcs sample lie at systematically larger redshifts compared to their 160sd survey counterparts .",
    "if the lack of emission lines in the 160sd survey is a physical effect and is not due to selection bias , it appears to be related to redshift .",
    "this interpretation implies that at a given x - ray luminosity , there are fewer well established _ strong _ cooling flows at higher redshift , suggesting rapid evolution between redshift one - half and today .",
    "note that our relatively high detection threshold is insensitive to the existence of weak cooling flows in the 160sd survey .",
    "roughly 15% of bcgs selected from the sloan and noao fundamental plane cluster surveys ( edwards et al .",
    "2007 ) have detectible line emission .",
    "this fraction rises to near unity for bona - fide cooling flow clusters .",
    "however , the h@xmath82 equivalent widths of most are weaker than our @xmath2   threshold .",
    "nevertheless , 28 of their 328 bcgs ( 8% ) drawn from the sloan survey have h@xmath82 equivalent widths stronger than @xmath2 , and all of them lie at redshifts at or below @xmath96 . a direct comparison between our survey and the edwards et al .",
    "( 2007 ) survey is infeasible because of the different selection methods .",
    "however , it is clear that were similar bcgs present in our survey , we would have detected a substantial fraction of them .",
    "the absence of any bcg with strong line emission in our sample bolsters the case for an evolutionary effect .",
    "we searched for nebular emission in a sample of 77 bcgs from the 160sd x - ray cluster survey .",
    "no or emission stronger than @xmath1    and @xmath2 , respectively , was detected in any bcg .",
    "a comparison between our sample and the bcs clusters of similar x - ray luminosity suggests that we should have detected roughly one dozen emission - line bcgs stronger than our detection threshold .",
    "160sd clusters of a given x - ray luminosity lie at systematically higher redshifts compared to bcs clusters of the same luminosity .",
    "this may indicate an increase in the number density of _ strong _ cooling flows between @xmath97 and today . because of our relatively high detection thresholds , our result does not imply that cooling flows do nt exist at the redshifts surveyed in the 160sd survey ( see bauer et al .",
    "2005 ) . however , we find a significant decrease in the number of _ strong _ cooling flows like the perseus cluster .",

    "( 2007 ) and by voevodkin et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who also found fewer cooling flow clusters at higher redshifts .",
    "the decline may be related to the destruction of cooling flows by mergers , which occurred more frequently than they do today ( santos et al .",
    "weaker mergers may also disturb x - ray atmospheres and miscenter the bcg , which could prevent a strong cooling flow from forming .",
    "agn feedback is thought to be responsible for quenching cooling flows in nearby clusters ( peterson & fabian 2006 ; mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) , but this is less clear in higher redshift clusters lacking the signatures of cooling flows .",
    "however , in a study of radio agn located in the 400 square degree x - ray cluster survey ( burenin et al .",
    "2007 ) , ma et al .",
    "( 2011 , in preparation ) found that the power injected by radio sources in galaxies lying within 250 kpc of cluster centers is significant compared to the power radiated by the hot atmospheres .",
    "the selection function of the 400 square degree survey is nearly identical to the 160 sd survey , but it covers a much larger area of the sky .",
    "the ma et al .",
    "study suggests that agn are able to deposit enough energy in these clusters to delay or prevent a massive cooling flow from forming at redshifts of a few tenths or so .",
