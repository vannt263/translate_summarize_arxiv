    "while still holding many surprises , one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum many - body systems have fascinated physicists and mathematicians alike for nearly a century .",
    "indeed , shortly after the inception of quantum mechanics , @xcite found an exact solution to the 1d heisenberg model using an _ ansatz _ for the wave function that nowadays bears his name .",
    "this early exact solution of a 1d quantum many - body problem of interacting ( but fixed ) spin-@xmath0 particles was to be followed by a multitude of others .",
    "other simple 1d models , which could not be solved exactly , were thoroughly studied by powerful methods especially suited for 1d . for long , many researchers regarded these solutions as mere mathematical curiosities that were , in general , of rather limited interest for the real three - dimensional ( 3d ) world .",
    "subsequent technological developments in the 20th and 21st centuries led to the discovery , chemical synthesis , and more recently fabrication of a wide range of ( quasi-)1d materials and physical systems .",
    "interestingly enough , the properties of these systems are sometimes fairly well captured by the ` toy models ' of the past . in this article",
    ", we shall review the physics of some of these models as well as their experimental realizations . however , unlike earlier reviews which have mainly focused on 1d systems of fermions  @xcite , we shall only deal with 1d systems where the constituent particles ( or the relevant excitations ) obey bose statistics .    as the reader will learn below , compared to higher dimensions ,",
    "the quantum statistics of the constituents plays a much less determinant role in 1d . nevertheless , when computing physical properties , quantum statistics dictates the type of observables that may be experimentally accessible .",
    "thus , because of the long standing interest in the electronic properties of quasi-1d materials and nanostructures , physicists have mainly focused their attention on 1d electron systems .",
    "much less attention has been given to 1d bosons , with the important exception of spin systems .",
    "we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec : mapping ] that spin-1/2 systems are mathematically equivalent to a lattice gas of hard - core bosons , and thus are also reviewed in this article .",
    "in fact , many quasi-1d materials exhibit ( mott-)insulating phases whose magnetic properties can be modeled by assuming that they consist of weakly coupled spin chains , similar to those analyzed by bethe in his groundbreaking work .",
    "besides the spin chains , interest in other bosonic systems is rather recent and was initially spurred by the fabrication of long 1d arrays of josephson junctions . in these systems ,",
    "cooper pairs ( which , to a first approximation , behave like bosons ) can hop around in 1d .",
    "even more recently , further experimental stimulus has come from the studies of the behavior at low temperatures of liquid @xmath1he confined in elongated mesoscopic pores , as well as from availability of ultracold atomic gases loaded in highly anisotropic traps and optical lattices .",
    "indeed , the strong confinement that can be achieved in these systems has made it possible to realize _ tunable _ low - dimensional quantum gases in the strongly correlated regime .",
    "as often happens in physics , the availability of new experimental systems and methods has created an outburst of theoretical activity , thus leading to a fascinating interplay between theory and experiment . in this article",
    ", we shall attempt to survey the developments concerning 1d systems of interacting bosons .",
    "even with this constraint , it is certainly impossible to provide a comprehensive review of all aspects of this rapidly evolving field .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] the basic models are derived starting from the most general hamiltonian of bosons interacting through a two - body potential in the presence of an arbitrary external potential .",
    "models both in the continuum and on the lattice are discussed .",
    "this section also introduces some important mappings allowing to establish the mathematical relationship of some of these boson models to other models describing @xmath2 spins or spinless fermions on 1d lattices .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : exactsol ] , exact solutions of integrable models along with with results on their correlation functions are reviewed .",
    "some of these results are important by themselves and not just merely academic models , as there currently exist fairly faithful experimental realizations of them . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical - results ] , we describe some of the computational approaches that can be used to tackle both integrable and non - integrable models .",
    "we also discuss their application to some 1d models of much current interest . the following section , sec .",
    "[ sec : bosonize ] , reviews the basic field - theoretic tools that describe the universal low - energy phenomena in a broad class of 1d interacting boson models , the so - called tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) phase . for these systems ,",
    "the method of bosonization and its relationship to the hydrodynamic description of superfluids ( which is briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] ) , are described .    the classification of phases and phase transitions exhibited by the models introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : pertlut ] , where besides the mott transition between the tll phase and the mott insulating phase , other kinds of instabilities arising when the bosons move in the presence of a disorder potential will be described .",
    "the low - energy picture is often unable to provide the quantitative details that other methods such as exact solutions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : exactsol ] ) or computational approaches ( [ sec : numerical - results ] ) do .",
    "thus , when results from any ( or both ) of the latter methods are available , they complement the picture provided by bosonization .",
    "further extensions are considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : coupled1dbosons ] , where studies of coupled 1d systems are reviewed .",
    "these include multicomponent systems ( binary mixtures of bosons or bosons and fermions ) .",
    "next we turn to the experimental realizations of systems of interacting bosons in 1d , which include spin ladders , superconducting wires , josephson junctions , liquid @xmath3he in nanopores , as well as the most recent ultracold atomic systems . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : outlook ] we shall provide a brief outlook for the field , focusing on non - equilibrium dynamics and other topics that may become important research topics in the future .",
    "in this section , we introduce the basic models that describe interacting bosons in 1d both in the continuum and on a lattice . these models will be analyzed using various techniques in the rest of the review .",
    "however , before embarking on the study of 1d physics per se , let us briefly recall the main general results for bosons in dimensions higher than one .",
    "this will serve as a reference with which we can compare the results in 1d .      as einstein discovered",
    "shortly after bose introduced a new type of quantum statistics , when the temperature of a system of @xmath4 non - interacting bosons is lowered , a phase transition occurs .",
    "below the transition temperature , the occupation ( @xmath5 ) of the lowest available energy state becomes macroscopic , i.e. , @xmath6 tends to a constant for @xmath4 large .",
    "the transition was therefore named ` bose - einstein condensation ' , and the macroscopically occupied quantum state , ` bose - einstein condensate ' .",
    "the acronym bec is used indistinctly for both concepts .",
    "mathematically , a bec can be described by a coherent state of matter , i.e. , an eigenstate of the boson field operator : @xmath7 , hence @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the zero - particle state , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a complex function of space ( @xmath12 ) and time ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the above definition implies that the @xmath14 symmetry group related to particle conservation must be spontaneously broken .",
    "however , this is sometimes problematic  @xcite because the use of coherent states for massive particles violates the super - selection rule forbidding the quantum superposition of states with different particle numbers .",
    "the definition of bec due to  @xcite circumvents this problem by relating the existence of a bec to the case in which the one - particle density matrix of the system , @xmath15 , behaves as @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) for @xmath18 .",
    "this behavior is referred to as _ off - diagonal _ long - range order ( odlro ) and @xmath11 is called the _ order parameter _ of the bec phase .",
    "however , yang s definition is not applicable to finite systems .",
    "following @xcite , a more general criterion is obtained by diagonalizing the one - particle density matrix , is a positive - definite hermitian matrix provided @xmath19 are regarded as matrix indices . ] as @xmath20 , where the _ natural orbitals",
    "_ @xmath21 are normalized such that @xmath22 .",
    "the existence of a bec depends on the magnitude of the @xmath23 compared to @xmath4 . when there is only one eigenvalue of @xmath24 ( say , @xmath25 ) , the system is a bec described by @xmath26",
    "when there are several such eigenvalues one speaks of a ` fragmented ' bec ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , provided the depletion of the bec is small , that is , for @xmath27 ( indeed , @xmath28 as @xmath29 for the non - interacting gas ) , it is possible to describe the state of the system using @xmath30^{n } |0\\rangle$ ] .",
    "note that , differently from the coherent state @xmath31 , @xmath32 has a well defined particle number and can be obtained from @xmath33 by projecting it onto a state with total particle number equal to @xmath4 .",
    "the definitions of bec due to yang , penrose and onsager are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit and also apply to interacting systems .",
    "in general , the ratio @xmath6 is called the condensate fraction .",
    "it is important to not to confuse the condensate fraction , which for a bec is finite , with the superfluid fraction .",
    "the latter is a thermodynamic property that is physically related to the fraction of the system mass that is not dragged along by the walls of the container when the latter rotates at constant angular frequency . in charged systems",
    ", it is related to meissner effect , i.e. , the expulsion of an externally applied magnetic field .",
    "mathematically , the superfluid fraction can be obtained as the thermodynamic response to a change in the boundary conditions of the system ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : bosonize ] for a discussion concerning 1d systems ) .",
    "indeed , the non - interacting bose gas below the condensation temperature is the canonical example of a bec that is not a superfluid . on the other hand",
    ", the 1d models discussed here do not exhibit bec ( even at @xmath34 ) .",
    "yet , they are good superfluids ( cf . sec .",
    "[ sec : bosonization - method ] )    the above discussion does not provide any insights into how to compute the bec wavefunction , @xmath11 , for a general system of mass @xmath35 bosons interacting through a potential @xmath36 and moving in an external potential @xmath37 , which is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath38 \\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{r})\\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\int d\\mathbf{r}\\ :   d\\mathbf{r'}\\ ,    \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r } ) \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger ( \\mathbf{r ' } ) v_\\mathrm{int}(\\mathbf{r'-r } )    \\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{r } ) \\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{r'}).\\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for such a system , in the spirit of a mean - field theory @xcite and @xcite independently derived an equation for the condensate wavefunction by approximating @xmath39 in the equation of motion , @xmath40 $ ] , by its expectation value @xmath41 over a coherent state , where @xmath42 is the chemical potential and @xmath43 the number operator .",

    "the use of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ eq : gross - pitaevskii ] ) to describe the interacting boson system assumes a small bec depletion , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "this is a good approximation in the absence of strong correlations and at low temperatures .",
    "thus , it is particularly suitable for dilute ultracold gases  @xcite , for which the range of inter - particle potential is much smaller than the inter - particle distance @xmath49 . in these systems ,",
    "interactions are well described by the lee - huang - yang pseudo - potential  @xcite @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the @xmath52-wave scattering length .",
    "typically , @xmath53 , except near a @xmath52-wave feshbach resonance  @xcite . for trapped gases , it has been rigorously established that in the limit of @xmath54 and @xmath55 fixed , the gross - pitaevskii approximation becomes exact for the ground state energy and particle density  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this limit , the gas is both 100% bose condensed@xcite and 100% superfluid  @xcite .    in a uniform system ,",
    "the above definitions imply that the momentum distribution : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a regular function of @xmath58 .",
    "the dirac delta function is the hallmark of the bec in condensed matter systems such like liquid @xmath1he below the @xmath59-transition . on top of the condensate ,",
    "interacting boson systems support excitations with a dispersion that strongly deviates from the free particle dispersion @xmath60 .",
    "a way to compute the excitation spectrum is to regard the gp equation as a time - dependent hartree equation .",
    "thus , its linearized form describes the condensate excitations , which , for a uniform dilute gas , have an a dispersion of the form @xmath61}$ ] , where @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the strength of the interaction .",
    "this was first obtained by bogoliubov , which proceeded differently by deriving a quadratic hamiltonian from ( [ eq : ham - sec ] ) in terms of @xmath64 and @xmath65 and keeping only the ( leading ) terms up to @xmath66 .",
    "note that , in the @xmath67 limit , the excitations above the bec state are linearly dispersing phonons : latexmath:[$\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k } ) \\simeq \\hbar v_s    from the point of view of the spontaneous break - down of the @xmath14 symmetry , the phonons are the goldstone modes of the broken - symmetry phase .",
    "we conclude this subsection by reviewing the hydrodynamic approach .",
    "although we derive it from the gp equation for a dilute gas , its validity extends beyond the assumptions of this theory to arbitrarily interacting superfluid systems in _ any _ dimension .",
    "we begin by setting @xmath69 in  ( [ eq : gross - pitaevskii ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath70-     \\frac{\\hbar}{2 m } \\frac{\\nabla^2    \\sqrt{\\rho}}{\\sqrt{\\rho}}\\right)=0.\\quad\\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first equation , ( [ eq : conservation ] ) , is the just continuity equation where the particle current @xmath71 .",
    "the second equation describes a potential flow with velocity potential @xmath72 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq - mot - velocity ] ) is called the quantum pressure .",
    "if we call @xmath73 the typical distance characterizing the density variations , the quantum pressure term scales as @xmath74 and therefore it is negligible compared to the classical pressure term @xmath75 when @xmath76 ( @xmath77 is known as the healing length ) . in the limit of a slowly varying density profile , the quantum pressure term in ( [ eq : eq - mot - velocity ] ) can be dropped and the equations can be written as : @xmath78 these equations coincide with the classical euler equation describing the flow of a non - viscous fluid with an equation of state where @xmath79 .",
    "this result is in agreement with simple thermodynamic considerations from which the classical fluid of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hydro - eqs ] ) has , at zero temperature , an energy per unit volume @xmath80 and chemical potential @xmath81 . in the literature on ultracold gases ,",
    "this approximation is known as the thomas - fermi approximation . in the static case ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 )",
    ", it leads to the equation @xmath84=0 $ ] , which allows to determine the bec density profile @xmath85 for a given trapping potential @xmath86 .    as mentioned above",
    ", the validity of the hydrodynamic equations is very general , and applies to strongly - interacting boson as well as fermion superfluids , for which the dependence of the chemical potential on the density is very different .",
    "however , in 1d the assumptions that underlie gp ( as well as bogoliubov ) theory break down .",
    "quantum and thermal fluctuations are strong enough to prevent the existence of bec , or equivalently , the spontaneous break - down of the @xmath14 symmetry in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this result is a consequence of the mermin - wagner - hohenberg ( mwh ) theorem @xcite , which states that , at finite temperature , there can not be a spontaneous break - down of continuous symmetry groups ( like @xmath14 ) in two - dimensional ( 2d ) classical systems with short range interactions .",
    "indeed , at @xmath34 , a 1d quantum system with a spectrum of long wave - length excitations with linear dispersion can be mapped , using functional integral methods , to a 2d classical system ( see discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : mapping ] for an example ) .",
    "therefore , the mwh theorem also rules out the existence of a bec in those 1d systems . for the 1d non - interacting bose gas ,",
    "the excitations have a quadratic dispersion , and thus the mapping and the theorem do not apply . however , a direct proof of the absence of a bec also in this case is not difficult ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) .    in the absence of a bec ,",
    "the assumptions of the gp theory and the closely related bogoliubov method break down . when applied to 1d interacting boson systems in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "these methods are plagued by infrared divergences .",
    "the latter are a manifestation of the dominant effect of long wavelength thermal and quantum fluctuations , as described by the mwh theorem . by decoupling the density and phase fluctuations ,",
    "@xcite was able to deal with these infrared divergences within the functional integral formalism .",
    "however , popov s method relies on integrating the short - wave length fluctuations perturbatively , which is a controlled approximation only for a weakly interacting system .",
    "however , for arbitrary interaction strength , it is necessary to resort to a different set of tools to tackle the 1d world . before going into their discussion , we first need to define the various models that we will use to describe the bosons interacting in 1d , and whose solutions are reviewed in the following sections .",
    "let us first consider the case of bosons moving in the continuum along one direction ( henceforth denoted by @xmath87 ) .",
    "thus , we assume that a very strong confinement is applied in the transverse directions [ denoted @xmath88 so that only the lowest energy transverse quantum state @xmath89 needs to be considered .",
    "hence , the many - body wavefunction reads : @xmath90 in what follows , we shall focus on the degrees of freedom described by @xmath91 .",
    "the most general hamiltonian for a system of @xmath4 bosons interacting through a two - body potential @xmath92 while moving in an external potential @xmath93 reads : @xmath94   +   \\sum_{i",

    "the simplest non - trivial model of interacting bosons in the continuum is the one introduced by @xcite , which is obtained from  ( [ eq : basicmodel1d ] ) upon setting @xmath98 and considering a dirac - delta interaction , @xmath99 .",
    "when a transverse external confinement is considered , an effective one - dimensional model with dirac - delta interaction can still be obtained within a pseudopotential approximation by properly summing over the virtual excitations of the high - energy transverse modes  @xcite ( cf .",
    "[ subsec : llgas ] ) . for the lieb - liniger model",
    "the hamiltonian reads : @xmath100 it is convenient to parametrize the interaction strength in this model using the parameter @xmath101 which has the dimension of an inverse length .",
    "thus , @xmath102 corresponds to free bosons while @xmath103 is the hard - core or tonks - girardeau limit  @xcite . as it will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : tonks ] , in this limit the model can be solved exactly by mapping it onto a system of non - interacting fermions . moreover , as shown by lieb and liniger , the model can be solved for all values of @xmath104 using the bethe ansatz . this solution is reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : lieb ] .",
    "@xcite has studied a generalization of the lieb - liniger model with feshbach resonant interactions , which can be approximately solved by the bethe ansatz .",
    "however , we shall not review this solution here and refer the reader to the original paper  @xcite .",
    "the lieb - liniger model is not the only interacting boson model that can be solved exactly .",
    "the following model @xmath105 which was introduced by  @xcite has also this property .",
    "moreover , calogero showed that the model is also solvable when a harmonic potential , i.e. , for @xmath106 , is added to eq .",
    "( [ eq : calogero - sutherland ] ) . the interaction strength in the model  ( [ eq : calogero - sutherland ] )",

    "one recovers the tg gas .",
    "this model will be further discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : calogero ] .",
    "furthermore , besides the two types of interactions leading to the exactly solvable models of lieb and liniger and calogero , it is also possible to consider other kinds of interactions that are experimentally relevant . among them , three types of interactions play an especially important role : i ) @xmath111 describes a system of ( polarized ) dipoles in 1d .",
    "such interaction is relevant for systems of dipolar ultracold atoms  @xcite or bosonic molecules .",
    "note that , contrarily to 3d , this potential is integrable in 1d ( i.e. , @xmath112 converges for large @xmath87 ) and thus it is essentially not different from a short but finite range interaction potential ; ii ) the unscreened coulomb potential @xmath113 is relevant for charged systems such as superconducting wires , josephson junction arrays , and trapped ion systems .",
    "this potential is nonintegrable even in 1d , and this leads to some modifications of the properties of the system at the long wavelengths compared to the case of short range interactions .",
    "furthermore , other models that are worth studying deal with the effect of different kinds of external potentials such as periodic , disorder , or trapping potentials .",
    "the effect of weak periodic potential will be considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : mott ] , whereas the effect of a strong periodic potential is best discussed by using the lattice models that will be introduced in the following section . in both cases , the potential leads to the existence of bosonic mott insulators .",
    "disorder potentials are another type that is relevant for both condensed matter systems , where it appears naturally , and currently for ultracold atomic systems , where it is introduced artificially to study its effects in a much more controlled way . in 1d bose systems , as it will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : disorder ] , it can lead to glassy phases .",
    "in addition , in ultracold atomic systems , the atoms are in the gaseous phase and therefore need to be contained . as it will briefly be described in sec .",
    "[ sec : coldatoms ] , the confining potential can be either made using laser light or ( time - dependent ) magnetic fields , and for small gas clouds , it can be well approximated by a harmonic potential , @xmath114 .",

    "let us now look at the case for which the commensurate system @xmath1119 would be a mi , i.e. @xmath1120 and look at the effect of an increasing @xmath1078 on the physics of the system .",
    "naively , the presence of a @xmath1121 term inside the cosine means that the cosine oscillates with space and thus is wiped out and its sole effect can be a renormalization of the ll parameters , leading back to a purely quadratic hamiltonian .",
    "this is traducing the fact that a _ doped _",
    "system is always at large distance a ll with algebraic decay of the correlations . of course",

    "one can thus follow the same route than the one used to determine the critical behavior of this transition to obtain the mott-@xmath1078 critical exponents .",

    "the former mott term is now hybridizing the right and left movers and thus opens a gap at energy zero in the initially gapless spectrum . the energy spectrum is @xmath1128 .",

    "it is easy to see that even if such a backward scattering was not present to start with , the combination of the forward scattering and the commensurate potential would always generate it .",
    "one can thus expect naively , when the disorder is increased , a transition between a mott insulator , which is _ incompressible _ and localized to a bose glass , which is _ compressible _ and also localized due to the backward scattering .    one interesting question @xcite is whether the bose glass phase totally surrounds the shrunk mott lobes in fig  [ fig : criticalmott ] , or whether at commensurate filling , a direct mi - sf transition would be possible . in 1d",
    "this question can be easily answered by looking at the combined renormalization of the commensurate potential , and the one of the backward scattering . for small forward scattering ,",
    "the commensurate flow  ( [ eq : kt - flow ] ) is essentially unperturbed .",
    "it reaches strong coupling before the forward disorder can cut the rg , which signals the existence of the mott gap .",
    "if the disorder is increased the flow will now be cut before the scale at which the mott gap develops . the mott phase is thus destroyed by the disorder , which corresponds to the shrinking of the mott lobe . on the other hand , as seen in ( [ eq : kt - flow ] ) , @xmath834 has now being renormalized to small values @xmath1178 . since",
