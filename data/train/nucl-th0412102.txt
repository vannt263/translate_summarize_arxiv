    "in the kaon condensed phase of neutron star matter , the energy density consists of three parts of contributions , i.e. @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the nuclear part , @xmath11 denotes the contribution of leptons , and @xmath12 is the contribution from the kaon - nucleon interaction .",
    "our calculations of the nuclear part of the eos are based on the bhf approach for asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the starting point of the bhf approach is the interaction @xmath13 matrix which satisfies the following bethe - goldstone ( bg ) equation@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the starting energy and @xmath16 [ 1-n(k_2)]$ ] is the pauli operator which prevents the two intermediate nucleons from being scattered into the states below the fermi sea .",
    "the isospin asymmetry parameter is defined as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 being the neutron , proton and total baryon number densities , respectively .",
    "the single particle ( s.p . ) energy is given by @xmath21 , where the s.p .",
    "potential is calculated from the real part of the on - shell g matrix , i.e. @xmath22 in the present calculations , we adopt the continuous choice for @xmath23 since it has been proved to provide a much faster convergency of the hole - line expansion for the energy per nucleon in nuclear matter up to high densities than the gap choice  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the continuous choice , the s.p . potential describes physically the nuclear mean field felt by a nucleon in nuclear medium .",
    "the realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction @xmath24 is the argonne @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) two - body force@xcite supplemented with the contribution of the tbf .",
    "the microscopic tbf adopted in the present calculations is constructed from the meson - exchange current approach  @xcite . in this tbf model , four important mesons @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are considered@xcite .",
    "the meson masses in the tbf have been fixed at their physical values except for the virtual @xmath31-meson mass which has been fixed at @xmath32mev according to ref .",
    "this value has been checked to satisfactorily reproduce the @xmath26 interaction from the one - boson - exchange potential ( obep ) model@xcite .",
    "the other parameters of the tbf , i.e. , the coupling constants and the form factors , have been determined from the obep model to meet the self - consistent requirement with the adopted @xmath26 two - body force .",
    "the values of the parameters are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "for a more detailed description of the model we refer to refs .",
    "we want to stress that the most important component of this tbf is essentially that introduced automatically in the walecka relativistic mean field theory  @xcite over that in the non relativistic theories .    in order to include the tbf contribution into the bg equation , we follow the standard scheme@xcite to reduce the tbf to an effective two - body interaction which is expressed in @xmath33 space as @xmath34 & \\times & \\displaystyle w_3(\\vec r_1^{\\ \\prime}\\vec r_2^{\\ \\prime } \\vec r_3^{\\ \\prime}|\\vec r_1 \\vec r_2 \\vec r_3 ) \\phi_n(\\tau_3r_3 ) ( 1-\\eta_{\\tau_1,\\tau_3}(r_{13}))(1-\\eta_{\\tau_2,\\tau_3}(r_{23 } ) ) \\end{array}\\label{eq : tbf}\\ ] ] where the trace is taken with respect to the spin and isospin of the third nucleon and the indices @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the isospin @xmath37-components .. the function @xmath38 is the defect function . since the defect function",

    ", we calculate the nuclear contribution @xmath10 to the total energy density @xmath39 for any given baryon density and isospin asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath10 of asymmetric nuclear matter can be separated into two part , i.e. , the isoscalar part and the isovector part .",
    "the stiffness of the isoscalar part plays an important role in predicting the structure of a neutron star while the isovector part is crucial for the chemical properties of neutron star matter .",
    "microscopic investigations@xcite show that for a fixed baryon density and isospin asymmetry , the isovector part of @xmath10 is completely determined by the symmetry energy @xmath40 and can be expressed as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the dimensionless baryon density and @xmath43 @xmath44 the empirical saturation density of nuclear matter .",
    "we evaluate the kaon - nucleon sector in the energy density of the kaon - condensed phase of matter in terms of the effective chiral lagrange density which was suggested by kaplan and nelson  @xcite and extensively investigated afterwards@xcite . in the kaplan - nelson model ,",

    "the coefficients @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 determine the strength of the chiral symmetry breaking in the last four terms .",
    "we adopt @xmath57 mev and @xmath58 mev obtained from the baryon mass splittings@xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath56 is related to the bare kaon mass by the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation @xmath59 .",
    "the parameter @xmath55 had remained largely uncertain for many years due to our poor knowledge of the strangeness content of the proton and the kaon - nucleon sigma term @xmath2@xcite .",
    "fortunately , the large ambiguity in this parameter has been settled recently by dong , laga and liu  @xcite with small error based on the lattice calculations .",
    "in the present calculations we adopt the value of @xmath55 in the range @xmath60 as done in refs.@xcite in order to investigate the sensitivity of the tbf effect to the varying of the proton strangeness content .",
    "our adopted central value @xmath61 mev is very close to the value extracted from the lattice guage calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite which is @xmath62 mev with error of less than @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath55 measures the proton strangeness content and plays an essential role in determining the threshold density for kaon condensation@xcite since it provides the dominant attraction in the kaon - nucleon interaction via the sigma term @xmath64 .",
    "the above specified range of @xmath65 from @xmath66 to @xmath67 corresponds to a reasonable range @xmath68 of the proton strangeness content@xcite .",
    "following exactly the standard prescript in ref.@xcite , we can get the kaon - nucleon energy density of the kaon condensed matter , i.e. @xmath69 where @xmath20 and @xmath70 denote the baryon number density and the proton fraction , respectively .",
    "@xmath71 is the amplitude of the condensation and comes from applying the baym theorem@xcite .",
    "the lepton part of the energy density @xmath72 can be readily obtained in a standard way from the contributions of the filled fermi seas of leptons@xcite .    in the neutron star matter with kaons",
    "the chemical equilibrium can be reached through the following reactions @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes leptons , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "one can determine the ground state by minimizing the total energy density with respect to the condensate amplitude @xmath71 keeping all densities fixed .",
    "this minimization together with the chemical equilibrium and charge neutrality conditions leads to the following three coupled equations@xcite @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xmath78 where @xmath79 represents the chemical potential of the negative charged particles and @xmath42 is the baryon number density in unit of @xmath80 .",
    "the last two equations are from the chemical equilibrium and charge neutrality conditions , respectively .",
    "the eos and the composition of the kaon condensed phase in the chemical equilibrium neutron star matter can be obtained by solving the coupled equations ( [ th - min ] ) , ( [ betatheta ] ) , and ( [ cntheta ] ) . the critical density for kaon condensation",
    "is determined as the very point above which a real solution for the coupled equations can be found .",
    "the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath40 is depicted in fig.[fig1 ] where the bold solid line and the thin solid line are obtained from the bhf approach adopting the @xmath26 plus the tbf and the pure @xmath26 two - body force , respectively . in the figure",
    "the symmetry energy from other models@xcite are also plotted for comparison .",
    "the dashed , dotted , and dot - dashed curves correspond to the following parameterizations proposed in ref.@xcite , @xmath81 and @xmath82 where @xmath83 mev and @xmath84 are the symmetry energy and the fermi energy at the nuclear saturation density , respectively .",
    "the double - dot - dashed line is the result of ref.@xcite by using the variational approach with the uv14+tni interaction .",
    "it is seen from the figure that in both cases with and without the tbf contribution , our calculated @xmath40 are monotonically increasing functions of the baryon density . below and around the empirical saturation density , the tbf effect is quite small , while at high densities the tbf contribution leads to a strong enhancement of the increasing rate of @xmath40 .",
    "this strong enhancement of the symmetry energy due to the tbf could be explained as follows .",
    "the symmetry energy ( the isovector sector of the eos ) describes the energy required to increase the isospin asymmetry of the matter . a higher value of asymmetry implies a larger neutron excess in the matter .",
    "therefore for a fixed density , at a higher isospin asymmetry the neutron fermi momentum becomes larger and consequently some nucleons may have higher momentum than in the symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "since the tbf is a short - range interaction and its effect is stronger for nucleons with larger momenta , its contribution to the eos increases as the isospin asymmetry increases  @xcite .",
    "the density dependence of the chemical potential @xmath79 of the negative charged particles in @xmath5-equilibrium neutron star matter is given in fig.[fig2 ] for three values of @xmath85 , and @xmath86 mev denoted by @xmath87 , respectively . in the figure the solid and dashed curves are the results with and without including the nuclear tbf contribution . below the critical density for kaon condensation ,",
    "the matter is made up of neutrons , protons , and leptons .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath79 is determined by the density dependence of the symmetry energy and it increases gradually with density in the case that the symmetry energy is an monotonically increasing function of density .",
    "the tbf enhances the increasing rate of @xmath79 . above the critical density",
    ", @xmath79 becomes a decreasing function of density .",
    "the decreasing rate of @xmath79 depends strongly on the choice of the proton strangeness content ( i.e. , on the value of @xmath55 ) , but completely insensitive to the choice of different models for the symmetry energy @xmath40 in the case that @xmath40 is an monotonically increasing function of density as shown in ref.@xcite . as a consequence ,",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as shown in tab.[tab - nc ] , the critical density @xmath88 for kaon condensation depends on both the proton strangeness content ( i.e. , the value of @xmath55 ) and the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy .",
    "the critical density @xmath88 is more sensitive to the proton strangeness than to the symmetry energy .",
    "the value of @xmath88 turns out to be lowered by increasing the proton strangeness , since the attractive interaction provided by the kaon - nucleon sigma term becomes smaller as the strangeness increases .",
    "this is in good agreement with the previous investigations by adopting different models for the symmetry energy@xcite .",
    "it is seen from the table that the predicted values of @xmath88 become less sensitive to different models for the symmetry energy as the strangeness increases .",
    "the tbf affects the critical density @xmath88 via its contribution to the symmetry energy and its effect is to reduce the critical density since it provides an additional repulsive contribution to the isospin symmetry energy@xcite .",
    "our predicted critical density is in the range of @xmath92 if the tbf is included and @xmath93 in the case without the tbf contribution . in the case of no strangeness ,",
    "inclusion of the tbf contribution in the symmetry energy reduces @xmath88 by more than @xmath94 from 5 to 3.8 .",
    "however , if the strangeness is higher , the tbf effect on @xmath88 becomes somewhat smaller .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath95mev , the tbf leads to only a less than @xmath96 reduction of @xmath88 .",
    "this can be readily understood since on the one hand , for larger values of the strangeness , the kaon condensation sets in at lower densities where the tbf contribution to the symmetry energy is relatively small . on the other hand , if the strangeness is higher , the in - medium energy of @xmath3 drops down faster as a function of baryon density . as a consequence ,",
    "the role played by the strangeness becomes more predominant over that by the symmetry energy for a higher value of the strangeness .    in fig.[fig3",

    "the proton fraction @xmath99 , the kaon fraction @xmath100 , and the lepton fraction @xmath101 are given by the solid curves , dashed curves , and dotted curves , respectively . below the critical density ,",
    "the matter is in its normal phase which is a highly neutron - rich and charge - neutral mixture of neutrons ( n ) , protons ( p ) , electrons ( e ) , and muons ( @xmath79 ) . in the normal @xmath102",
    "matter , the proton fraction @xmath103 increases gradually with density and the tbf contribution makes the @xmath103 rise faster .",
    "however , in the condensed phase , the matter becomes more or less proton - rich instead of neutron - rich , since a large fraction of protons is required to balance the negative charge of @xmath3 which is so abundant in the kaon condensed phase . at high enough density ,",
    "the matter contains even positrons in chemical equilibrium to ensure the charge neutrality .",
    "these results are in agreement with the previous investigations@xcite . from fig.[fig3 ] , one can see that the proton and kaon fractions in the condensed phase depend sensitively on the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy .",
    "inclusion of the tbf contribution makes the kaon condensed neutron star matter more symmetric in protons and neutrons .",
    "as the matter goes from the normal phase to the kaon condensed phase , the redistribution of charge depends strongly on the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy .",
    "if the tbf contribution is included , the symmetry energy rises much faster as a function of density . as a consequence ,",
    "the matter is driven to more symmetric in neutrons and protons in order to reduce the additional repulsive isospin energy due to the tbf contribution .    in ref.@xcite",
    "the kaon condensation has been studied by adopting the symmetry energy from the variational calculations in ref.@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the present results from the bhf approach as well the predictions from the dirac - brueckner method@xcite and the relativistic mean field theory@xcite , the symmetry energy calculated in ref.@xcite decreases with density at high enough densities . as a consequence , the composition in the kaon condensed phase in ref.@xcite strongly deviates from our result due to the completely different high - density behavior of the symmetry energy .",
    "for example , in the most extreme case of the uv14+tni interaction , the obtained neutron star becomes almost a  proton \" star just above the critical density for kaon condensation as shown in fig .",
    "4 . while in the present calculations , the neutron star matter with kaons prefers to be symmetric nuclear matter in agreement with the results reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy obtained from the bhf and the variational approaches is still not clear@xcite and deserves further investigations .",
    "it should be stressed that in the present investigations , we do not consider the mixed phase of the normal matter and the condensed matter .",
    "it has been pointed out@xcite that in the first - order phase transition to the kaon condensed phase , the conservation law(s ) can only be fulfilled in a global rather than a local sense .",
    "this means that in the mixed phase , the local charge - neutrality , i.e. eq.([cntheta ] ) becomes invalid .",
    "since our aim is to investigate the nuclear tbf effects on the critical density and the chemical composition of the condensed phase , the present simplification is somewhat desirable for our purpose .",
    "however , for practical applications in neutron stars we should consider the problem of the mixed phase formation as done in ref.@xcite which will be discussed elsewhere .    before summary , we discuss briefly the possible implications of our results for the maximum mass of neutron stars .",
    "in fig.[fig5 ] we display the predicted eos of neutron star matter for both cases with kaons ( solid curves ) and without kaons ( dashed curves ) . in the figure the results by using the @xmath26 plus the tbf ( right panel ) are compared to the ones by adopting the pure @xmath26 two - body force ( left panel ) .",
    "it is seen that in the case of no kaons , inclusion of the tbf contribution makes the eos at high densities become much more stiffer . as a consequence ,",
    "the maximum mass of neutron stars becomes much larger if the tbf contribution is included as shown in ref.@xcite where the calculated maximum mass is about 2.3 m@xmath104 and 1.6 m@xmath104 respectively for the two cases with and without including the tbf in the calculations for our central value of @xmath105 mev .",
    "the latter value is close to the 1.5 m@xmath106 found in ref.@xcite for a compression modulus of 210 mev . in the case",
    "that kaons are allowed , the eos of the matter in the condensed phase is softened considerably due to the attractive interaction between nucleons and kaons .",
    "since a softer eos implies a smaller maximum neutron star mass , the kaon condensation may lower the predicted maximum mass in both cases with and without the tbf . in our present work , however , we do not consider the role of other possible strange particles , such as @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 hyperons .",
    "the appearance of hyperons may provide an additional softening of the neutron star eos and consequently reduce further the predicted maximum mass@xcite .",
    "one would have to minimize the free energy at each density in order to choose the appropriate configuration .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the nuclear tbf effects on the kaon condensation in neutron star matter in the framework of the bhf approach .",
    "the tbf affects the critical density for the kaon condensation through its repulsive contribution to the symmetry energy . in both cases with and without the tbf ,",
    "the calculated symmetry energy is an monotonically increasing function of baryon density , in agreement with the results from the relativistic mean field approach and the db approach .",
    "the tbf repulsion turns out to increases rapidly as the baryon density increases . as a consequence",
    "the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy becomes much stiffer as compared to the one obtained by adopting only the two - body nuclear force .",
    "our results show that inclusion of the tbf contribution in the symmetry energy reduces the critical density by about @xmath110 depending on the choice of the proton strangeness content .",
    "the influence of the tbf on the critical density becomes smaller if the strangeness is higher .",
    "the predicted critical density is in the range from 2.4@xmath80 to 3.8@xmath80 when the tbf is included .",
    "the additional repulsive contribution to the isospin energy due to the tbf drives the kaon condensed phase of neutron star matter to become more symmetric in neutrons and protons as compared to the results without the tbf . in the normal phase of neutron star matter the proton fraction is small and the matter is highly neutron - rich .",
    "the proton fraction gradually increases with baryon density . while in the kaon condensed phase",
    ", the matter becomes proton - rich in order to balance the negative charge of the kaon field .",
    "the composition in the kaon condensed phase depends sensitively on the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy .",
    "we find that the additional repulsion from the tbf lowers the proton and kaon fractions in the kaon condensed phase and it is so strong at high densities as to make the condensed matter almost symmetric in neutrons and protons .",
