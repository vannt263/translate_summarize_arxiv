    "our proof was very topological , but a simpler recursive proof is given in @xcite .",
    "the result is as follows : @xmath387 the numbers @xmath388 are called _ fuss - catalan numbers_. as a function of @xmath10 , @xmath388 is on the order of @xmath389 .",

    "if the balanced string @xmath136 has length @xmath430 ( @xmath10 @xmath140s and @xmath10 @xmath1s ) , then the associated lattice path @xmath426 is a @xmath431-slope piecewise - linear curve joining @xmath432 to @xmath433 ( and each such curve , with slope - breaks at integer points , corresponds to a balanced @xmath140-@xmath1 string ) .",
    "figure [ fig lattice path ] shows the lattice path corresponding to the string @xmath136 considered above .",
    "the lattice path @xmath426 gives an easy geometric condition on allowed non - crossing pairings of @xmath136 .",

    "the statistic of a string which is important for the upper bound is the _ lattice path height _ @xmath434 , which is simply the total height ( total number of vertical increments ) in @xmath426 ; that is , @xmath434 is the number of distinct labels needed on the vertical axis of the lattice path . in figure [ fig lattice path ] , @xmath435 .",

    "the remaining unpaired entries in @xmath440 form a copy of @xmath136 , and since the labels correspond , there is a bijection between pairings of @xmath136 and pairings of this inclusion of substrings .",

    "figure [ fig proof of lemma upper bound ] demonstrates the inclusion .",
    "note that the lattice path height is the smallest @xmath25 which can be used in the proof of lemma [ lemma upper bound on nc_2 ] , since all labels appearing in @xmath426 must be present in @xmath439 .",

    "this means that the lattice path @xmath426 never drops below the horizontal axis , and so each vertical label corresponds to at least one up - slope ( the first one where it appears , for example ) .",

    "if @xmath152 , then each of its blocks alternates between @xmath140s and @xmath1s ; from the form of @xmath136 this means blocks must have length at most @xmath451 , so @xmath86 consists of @xmath448-blocks and @xmath451-blocks .",
    "if @xmath86 has a @xmath451-block , all remaining blocks of @xmath86 are nested between its consecutive pairings , and since a @xmath451-block must connect one element from each of the four segments in @xmath136 , it follows from the non - crossing condition that all remaining blocks of @xmath86 are @xmath448-blocks , and are determined by the position of the @xmath451-block .",
