    "we can seriously anticipate the discovery of a transiting super - earth @xcite sized planet orbiting a sun - like star in the near - term future .",
    "numerical simulations of migrating hot jupiters have indicated that one might expect earth , super - earth and neptune sized planets in similar orbits , or in mean - motion resonances with the hot jupiter ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the interior regions of these hot jupiter exoplanetary systems , and specifically the mean - motion resonances of these hot jupiters , have been probed with the transit - timing method in a handful of transiting exoplanetary systems to date - these are tres-1 ( k0 v ) @xcite , hd 209458 ( g0 v ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and hd 189733 ( k0 v ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the existence of a hot jupiter planet , hd 189733b , in the star system hd 189733 ( v = 7.67 ) was first reported by @xcite .",

    "a number of researchers have determined characteristics of the planet by measuring the drop in flux during the secondary eclipse .",
    "these results include the thermal emission of the planet @xcite , one of the first spectra of an extrasolar planet @xcite , as well as the first measurement of the day - night contrast of an extrasolar planet @xcite .",
    "recent evidence indicates that hd 189733 is likely a binary system with a mid - m dwarf star , hd 189733b ( period @xmath3 3200 @xmath4 ) , as a companion to the main k0 star , hd 189733 @xcite .",
    "the putative transiting planets that are searched for in our manuscript are assumed to transit the primary star , hd 189733 , as does the known planet hd 189733b .",

    "in addition to the original discovery of hd 189733b around this active star , and the pioneering work of the tep network ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , @xcite recently found that they could rule - out jupiter and neptune - sized planets with short periods via the transit method around the active star au mic .",
    "we extend these efforts to the neptune and super - earth - sized regime by investigating the continuous and accurate photometry returned by _",

    "the _ most _ satellite was launched on 30 june 2003 and its initial mission is described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a 15/17.3-cm rumak - maksutov telescope feeds two ccds , one originally dedicated to tracking and the other to science , through a single , custom , broadband filter ( 350  700 nm ) .",

    "photometry of very bright stars ( @xmath8 ) is obtained in fabry imaging mode , in which a fabry microlens projects an extended image of the telescope pupil illuminated by the target starlight to achieve the highest precision ( see matthews et al .",

    "for the first 14 days of this run , hd 189733 was the exclusive target ; for the final 7 days , it was shared with another primary science target field during each 101.4-min orbit of the satellite .",
    "consequently , during the last third of the run , hd 189733 was observed only during intervals of high stray earthshine , resulting in somewhat increased photometric scatter .",
    "the duty cycles of the light curve are 94% during the first 14 days and 46% during the last 7 days . early in 2006 the tracking ccd system of _ most _ failed due to a particle hit .",
    "thereafter both science and tracking were carried out with the science ccd system . to avoid introducing significant tracking errors exposures were limited to 1.5 sec .",
    "14 consecutive exposures were then stacked on board to improve signal - to - noise , and downloaded from the satellite every 21 sec .",
    "approximately 112,000 of these combined observations were taken .",
    "the photometric reduction was performed by one of us ( jfr ) using techniques similar to those described by @xcite and rowe et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the reduction procedure of aperture photometry is similar to that applied to groundbased ccd photometry , but is non - differential .",
    "our reduction pipeline corrects for cosmic ray hits ( more frequent during satellite passages through the south atlantic anomaly [ saa ] ) , the varying background due to scattered earthshine modulated at the satellite orbital period , and flatfielding effects .",
    "further details are given by matthews et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . it should also be noted that hd 189733 , and its m - dwarf companion are sufficiently well separated ( 216 au or 11.2  [ @xcite ] ) , that they do not contaminate the photometric signal obtained by",
    "_ most_.      for this transit search , additional selection and filtering of the photometry was done to optimize the data for the application of monte carlo statistics .",
    "the filtering is an automated part of the transit search routine , and is thus briefly summarized in @xmath6[sectrans ] .",
    "this filtering step is described in detail here .",
    "data obtained during passages through the saa are conservatively excised from the light curve , due to the increased photometric scatter during those most orbital phases , without reducing seriously the phase coverage of the exoplanetary periods searched .",
    "the transits of the known giant planet hd 189733b are removed , at the orbital period @xmath11 @xmath3 2.21857d determined by @xcite .",
    "the first @xmath30.8@xmath12 of the data - set was excluded from the analysis due to an obvious temperature swing - in effect common to _",
    "most_. the obvious modulation of the light curve , due to starspot activity , was removed with a cubic spline @xcite .",
    "the cubic spline was generated with data binned every @xmath3500 minutes ; this trend was then subtracted from the unbinned data .",
    "this value of @xmath3500 minutes is believed to be optimum , as it effectively balances the competing desires of having a sufficiently short binning time to effectively remove long period modulation , with the desire of having a long binning time to ensure that one is able to recover transits with periods in the upper range of our interesting period range ( @xmath11 @xmath13 5@xmath12 ) .",
    "limited statistical tests have confirmed that this binning value optimizes our sensitivity to transits of hd 189733 with periods in the upper range of our period range . the signal to noise that an individual transit is recovered with can be highly dependent on this binning time for transits of relatively long periods ( @xmath11 @xmath13 5@xmath12 ) .",
    "at these longer periods the cubic - spline can filter out much of the amplitude of the transit signal a low percentage of the time .",
    "this effect can also be seen with the reduced efficiency at longer periods for the ninety - degree inclination angle case of the monte carlo statistics ( figure [ figmonte ] ) .",
    "_ most _ suffers from stray earthshine with its 101.4-min orbital period , and this stray light background can also be modulated at a period of 1 day and its first harmonic ( due to the sun - synchronous nature of the most satellite orbit ) .",
    "for this reason , sinusoidal fits with periods within 1% of 1 and 0.5 d were subtracted from the data . after these cuts , any remaining outliers greater than @xmath14 were excised . in general , there were few points removed by this sigma - cut as few points were such extreme outliers .",
    "it is also important to note that the magnitudes of the injected transits ( @xmath6[secmonte ] ) were always at a level much less than this sigma - cut .",
    "the data were also median - subtracted , for reasons outlined in @xcite .",
    "the automatic filtering step removed @xmath38% of the original data ( mostly due to the saa and stray light corrections ) .",
    "the hd 189733 light curves before and after these reduction steps are plotted in figure [ figdata ] .",
    "these filtered data ( and the original reduced data ) can be downloaded from the _ most _ public data archive at www.astro.ubc.ca/most .",
    "the transit search routine used here is fully described in @xcite , and is briefly summarized here .",
    "the minor modifications to the routine are highlighted below .",
    "the transit routine consists of five steps : ( i ) an automated filtering step ( described in detail in @xmath6[secmostreduce ] ) , ( ii ) a modified version of the eebls ( edge effect box - fitting least squares ) algorithm of @xcite that searches for box - shaped transits , ( iii ) selection criteria to select the the best candidates that can be tested for astrophysical plausibility , ( iv ) realistic transit - fitting and refinement of the transit parameters , and finally ( v ) detection criteria to differentiate false positives from likely transit candidates .",
    "the detection criteria used in this study are summarized here .",
    "we use the transit to anti - transit ( the best - fit brightening event with the shape of a transit ) ratio statistic ( rs ) of @xcite to quantify a believable transit . the rs value that a transit has to exceed to be deemed",
    "a believable transit is : @xmath15/@xmath16 @xmath17 0.735 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 refer to the normal @xmath20 ( the sum of sqaured residuals ) for the best - fit transit , and anti - transit , respectively .",
    "this value was motivated by the results of the monte carlo tests ( @xmath6[secmonte ] ) .",
    "the rs statistic serves to objectively quantify the significance of the measured signal against the correlated scatter in the data , and to thus stringently rule - out false positives .",
    "the correlated signal to noise calculation of @xcite serves a similar purpose .",
    "the rs will be used in this present application .",
    "the restriction on the quantity f , a measure of the ratio of the strength of any one specific transit compared to the others , as described in @xcite , and @xcite , was also relaxed such that transits were accepted as long as f @xmath21 0.85 .",
    "this motivation for this less stringent criterion was based on the monte carlo statistics that indicated that a more conservative criterion on f would rule out realistic transits , without an appreciable decrease in the number of false positives in our data - set .",
    "the precise values used for various parameters in the eebls step ( ii ) in the transit search routine are summarized in table [ tablebls ] .",
    "we have decreased the minimum value probed by the eebls routine in the application of this transit search routine to hd 189733 , compared to its application to hd 209458 in @xcite .",
    "this is due to the conclusions of @xcite , who observed a number of ultra - short period ( @xmath11 @xmath21 1.0 @xmath12 ) planet candidates in the sweeps survey , and noted that these planets may preferrentially be found around low - mass stars .",
    "hd 189733 has a stellar mass of 0.82 @xmath22 @xcite , below the limit of 0.88 @xmath22 suggested by @xcite to be indicative of a preference for ulta - short period planets .",
    "the minimum period investigated by the eebls routine is thus now 0.4@xmath12 , a value corresponding to a semi - major axis , @xmath23 , of just under three times the stellar radius ( @xmath23 @xmath24 2.5@xmath25 ) . for comparison",
    ", ogle - tr-56b has @xmath23@xmath24@xmath26 , the smallest orbital radius in terms of its stellar radius of a confirmed planet to date .",
    "the maximum period of 6.9@xmath12 is chosen similar to the maximum value for hd 209458 in @xcite , as a value that would allow one to observe three distinct transits in the 21 @xmath12 data - set .",
    "this period range of 0.4 to 6.9 @xmath12 corresponds to 0.01 to 0.07 au .",
    "the minimum fractional transit length is 0.75 times that of the calculated average fractional transit length at that period - a value chosen to ensure the routine remains adequately sensitive to transiting planets with non edge - on inclination angles .",
    "we also increase the number of bins , @xmath27 , used by the eebls algorithm for short periods compared to the application of @xcite to hd 209458 .",
    "the number of bins , @xmath27 , used by the eebls algorithm for each period , @xmath11 , is determined by the following formula : @xmath28p@xmath29$]@xmath3020.0/@xmath31 , where @xmath31 is the minimum fractional transit length to be tested .",
    "@xmath31 , and the maximum fractional transit length , @xmath32 , are determined as given in table [ tablebls ] , from our average estimate of the fractional transit length for a hypothetical planet , @xmath33 , at various periods @xcite .",
    "in our transit selection step we now select the top three eebls sr signals , instead of the top two , as well as up to two transit signals with sr signals that are at least 1.8 times the noise floor .",
    "a full explanation of these details is provided in @xcite .",
    "the stellar characteristics used to determine the realistic limb - darkened transit model ( iv ) are summarized in table [ tablefit ] .",
    "the precise transit parameters are refined using a marquardt - levenberg routine ( described in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "the method used to refine our transit parameters is very similar to the newton - raphson method applied by @xcite for the same purpose .",

    "to assess the sensitivity of our routine and the _ most _ data - set to smaller transiting planets in the hd 189733 system , simulated transits for planets of various radii and orbital parameters were inserted into the _ most _ photometry and monte carlo statistics of the transit recovery rate were generated .",
    "we thus proceed under the assumption that all signals in the data - set are noise , and we place as sensitive of limits as possible under this paradigm .",
    "realistic limb - darkened transits due to planets with various radii , @xmath48 , orbital phases , @xmath49 , periods , @xmath11 , and inclinations , @xmath50 , were inserted into the 2006 _ most _ hd 189733 data .",
    "the full non - linear model of @xcite was used to ensure the inserted transits were as realistic as possible .",

    "simulated transits corresponding to 20 different exoplanet radii were inserted , sampling the period - radius space of interest .",
    "for each period and radius at least 100  phases were inserted .",
    "for each of these points , the phase @xmath49 was generated randomly to be in the range 0 @xmath55 @xmath49 @xmath21 1 . because a 2.4 ghz pentium processor with 1 gbyte of memory can perform the transit search algorithm on an individual most hd 189733 data set in @xmath31 minute , exploration of the entire grid just mentioned for all inclinations involves @xmath03@xmath30@xmath56 iterations and 0.6 cpu years .",
    "the calculation was performed on the leverrier beowulf cluster in the department of physics and astronomy at the university of british columbia using 46 dual - cpu compute nodes .",
    "an inserted transit was judged to be detected if the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath11 returned by the transit search algorithm were sufficiently close to the input values : @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the returned period had to satisfy the following criteria : @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the limits of the criterion for @xmath49 were dependent on the planetary orbital period , because as the period of the putative transiting planet decreases , the fractional transit length increases accordingly .",
    "thus the accuracy required in the determination of @xmath49 was relaxed for shorter periods .",
    "the criterion on @xmath49 is : @xmath61 @xmath21 @xmath62 @xmath30 ( @xmath58 - 0.4@xmath12)/@xmath12 .",
    "this corresponds to accepting an error in phase of up to 9% at 0.4@xmath12 , but only up to 2% at 7@xmath12 .",
    "obvious multiples of the period of the inserted planet , up to @xmath63 times the inserted period , @xmath58 , as well as half - period ( @xmath64 ) , and one - third period ( @xmath65 ) solutions were also accepted . for the monte carlo tests",
    "when a transit was deemed recovered the correct period was recovered 96% of the time , while the remainder returned a period that was double , triple , quadruple , one - half , or one - third of the inserted period , @xmath58 .",
    "the level above which a transit recovered from the data - set could be considered believable was also determined due to these monte carlo tests , at a level of @xmath15/@xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath66 that ruled out 95% of the spurious candidates .",
    "spurious candidates are defined as those candidates where the parameters returned by the transit search routine are different from the parameters inserted for the monte carlo tests .",
    "the motivation for this criterion is to ensure that a systematic event is misidentified as a believable transiting planet less than 5% of the time .",
    "interestingly we can rigorously rule out these spurious candidates , with our criterion set at a level where the most significant transit candidate can be less significant than the most significant anti - transit ( brightening ) event .",
    "further discussion on this criterion is given in @xcite .",
    "so as to not unduly skew this statistic we only generate this statistic using putative planets with radii large enough that the routine has a realistic chance of detecting these planets .",
    "we judge this to be planets greater than approximately the 25% contour of our monte carlo statistics without the rs criterion .",
    "thus only planets with radii greater than the following limit are used : @xmath67d@xmath68 @xmath1 .",
    "the fractions of times that the artificially inserted transits were recovered from the data for various radii , periods , and inclination angles are given in figure [ figmonte ] . also indicated in figure [ figmonte ] is the 68% contour limit that would be placed without the @xmath15/@xmath16 @xmath17 0.735   criterion .",
    "the close agreement between the 68% contour with or without this criterion indicates that this criterion does not seriously impact the sensitivity of the monte carlo statistics generated , while providing a robust limit so as to avoid false positives and spurious detections .",
    "we also explore the distribution of spurious signals across period - radii space .",
    "these values are displayed in figure [ figmontefalse ] , and indicate that spurious signals are negligible ( below 1% ) other than the intermediate areas where the routine has a small to moderate chance to correctly determine the inserted transit .",
    "this result is expected , as it is similar to the result of @xcite for hd 209458 .",
    "the performance of our routine is also expected to be slightly degraded at harmonics and subharmonics of the periods that the sinusoids were removed from the data at ( @xmath11=1.0@xmath12 , and @xmath11=0.5@xmath12 ) . due to the fact that the fractional length of a transit is comparitively large for short periods of 0.5 - 1.0 @xmath12",
    ", it can be difficult to completely differentiate and properly recover a transit signal near the harmonics and subharmonics of these periods in all cases .",
    "the period ranges demonstrating these drops in survey sensitivity are very narrow ( @xmath69 @xmath24 2% ) .",
    "limited statistical tests confirm that the loss in sensitivity near these periods is quite small , similar to that of hd 209458 @xcite .",
    "the harmonics and subharmonics of the orbital period of the known planet hd 189733b , @xmath11 @xmath24 2.218573d @xcite , are also expected to show decreased sensitivity to transits due to the fact that the transits of the known planet were excised from the data .",
    "this reduction of sensitivity at these periods is unfortunate considering that it is expected that low - mass planets show a preference for these mean - motion resonant orbits ( @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the fractional length in phase that was removed at @xmath11 @xmath24 @xmath70 to exclude the transit of the known planet was 4.0% of the total .",
    "thus for the subharmonics of the known planet ( @xmath11 @xmath24 4.44@xmath12 , 6.66@xmath12 ) in approximately 4.0% of the cases the routine will be unable to recover a putative transiting planet , as the transits will coincide with the transits of the known planet , and this information will have been completely removed . for the harmonics of the orbital period of hd 189733b ,",
    "the situation is better , since not all of the transit events would have been removed from the data . for periods near the first harmonic ( @xmath11 @xmath24 1.11@xmath12 ) , every second occurance of a transit will be lost in only 8.0% of the cases . for the second harmonic ( @xmath11 @xmath24 0.74@xmath12 ) , every third transit",
    "would be missed in 12.0% of the cases . for periods near these values",
    "the sensitivity limits can be expected to be only slightly degraded from those shown in figure [ figmonte ] . even for exact harmonics",
    "the routine s sensitivity should be only marginally worse than the limits quoted in figure [ figmonte ] , as the remaining transits should allow the correct period ( or a multiple of the period ) to be recovered .",
    "the mean - motion resonances from the known exoplanet hd 189733b have been examined using the transit - timing technique with ground - based photometry by @xcite , hst photometry by @xcite , and with _ most _ photometry by @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that the detection limits presented here are valid for circular orbits , but are largely applicable to orbits of other eccentricities , as summarized for the analogous case of hd 209458 in @xcite .    we have made the simplifying assumption that the hypothetical planet that transits the star to produce the synthetic transits of our monte carlo statistics does not pass over prominent starspots along our line of sight .",
    "the known planet has not been found to occult a prominent starspot in the _ most _ photometry @xcite , although a preliminary investigation of hst photometry of hd 189733 indicates that the planet does occult small to moderate sized starspots during their observations @xcite .",
    "given that the rotational period of the star is greater than the period range that is investigated here , the limits presented here would likely only be slightly adversely affected if this hypothetical planet does pass in front of a prominent starspot .",
    "this is because the impact on the transit dip of the planet occulting a large starspot would be relatively short , and should thus not severely affect our limits .",
    "thus the search routine described above in @xmath6[sectrans ] should be able to detect planets with radii greater than the limits given in figure [ figmonte ] with the _ most _ data . in the most optimistic case of an edge - on @xmath71 inclination angle transit , for planets with periods from approximately half - a - day to one week , this limit is approximately 0.15  to 0.31  @xmath1 , or 1.7to 3.5  @xmath2 , respectively , with 95% confidence .",
    "these limits would scale up , or down linearly if the expected stellar radius , @xmath25 = 0.755 @xmath42 , is an over- or under - estimate , and are thus perhaps better expressed as @xmath72/@xmath25 = 0.020  and @xmath72/@xmath25 = 0.042  for periods from half - a - day to one week , respectively . for periods at the upper range of those investigated here ( @xmath11 @xmath13 6.5@xmath12 ) the routine is unable to pick out the transit in a low percentage of cases , because the cubic spline has removed significant power at that period ; this effect can be observed as a reduction of sensitivity for longer periods in the ninety - degree inclination angle ( @xmath50=90@xmath53 ) panel of fig .",
    "[ figmonte ] .",
    "the performance of our automatic routine in this period - radius space probably underestimates the true sensitivity of our survey , as it would be obvious that the cubic spline has overcorrected in these cases through an individual inspection of the phased curve .",
    "also , limited statistical tests have shown that marginally improved limits could probably be set for the shortest periods ( p @xmath55 3@xmath12 ) by excluding the last seven days of observations with increased noise , and only producing these limits with the first 14 days of the highest quality data .",
    "the _ most _ hd 189733 2006 data - set was submitted to the analysis outlined in @xmath6[sectrans ] .",
    "there were no transiting planet candidates that met the detection criteria .",
    "as the monte carlo tests indicate we would be able to detect exoplanets in this system with periods from half - a - day to one week with radii larger than the radius limits given in figure [ figmonte ] , we can safely rule out these sized - exoplanets in this system .",
    "we also present the details of the candidate with the greatest improvement in @xmath20 , even though evidence for its existence is marginal .",

    "interestingly the period of this planet places it quite close to the 1:3 interior mean - motion resonance to the known planet ( @xmath11@xmath30.74@xmath12 ) . for @xmath76",
    "@xmath24 3000 kg m@xmath77 the mass of this putative planet would be approximately 1.8  @xmath5 ( 0.006  @xmath78 ) . a transit time combined with the supposed period",

    "the most significant brightening event was one observed with a period of approximately @xmath79 .",
    "it is likely statistical in nature , and thus is not expected to be related to any specific astrophysical process .",
    "although our transit search covers a continuous set of periods , we do not expect the existence of another planet with a semimajor axis ` too close ' to that of the known planet hd189733b , since the gravitational perturbations of the known jupiter - scale planet will destabilize the orbit of another object .",

    "the fractional width @xmath85 of the annulus is given by @xcite : @xmath86 where the assumption is being made that the mass of the second planet is much less than the known planet ( if not , the width of the zone scales as the cube root of the sum of the masses of the planets ) . here",

    "a planet of this size would correspond to @xmath3 20 @xmath5 , as calculated from the models of @xcite assuming a composition similar to neptune .",
    "we can also place a limit on transiting planets with orbital periods from 7 @xmath12 @xmath21 p @xmath21 10.5 @xmath12 - in this region we would expect two transits in our data - set .",

    "was applied to the current data - set without the removal of the transits of the known planet , hd 189733b . as the transits are apparent in the unbinned data ( figure [ figdata ] ) , this causes the cubic - spline to over - correct and remove a moderate portion of the signal at this period .",

    "it should also be noted that we are able to place very sensitive limits on the size of planets that can be ruled out in this system despite the prominent @xmath33% rotational modulation observed in this system . by removing the observed rotational modulation using a cubic spine with a binning time longer than the expected duration of the transit of the planet across the star , we are able to remove the effects of the prominent modulation while remaining sensitive to the transits of planets as small as those expected from hot super - earths and hot neptunes .",
    "these methods should be applicable to current or future space - based transit search missions , such as corot and kepler .",

    "we use the definition of trojans given by @xcite as objects occupying the l4 or l5 stable lagrange points .",
    "trojans lagging or leading hd 189733b with a radius above @xmath87 = 0.24  @xmath1 ( 2.7@xmath75 ) should have been detected with 95% confidence . using a mean density of @xmath76@xmath24 3000 kg m@xmath77",
    "this corresponds to 11  @xmath88 .",
    "a detailed study of this photometry should be able to radically improve this limit on the size of trojans that can be ruled out with this photometry , assuming the trojan consistently transits the star along our line of sight .",
    "the above limits on the smallest planetary radii excluded by _ most _ for transiting planets allow some estimates on the type of planets that are being excluded in this system . for gas giant planets , including hot neptunes , radii change with time as the planet cools , so we make use of the fact that the age of the hd 189733 system is greater than 1 gyr @xcite . we follow the suggestion of @xcite and",
    "adopt an age of @xmath34.5 gyr .",
    "we thus can refer to cooling models similar to the planets in the solar system .",
    "one exception would be the consideration of possible planets in orbits smaller than that of hd189733b , where tidal heating will lead to larger radii per given mass and composition .",
    "our radius limit of 1.7  - 3.5  @xmath2 already places us in the realm of super - earth and hot neptune planets .",
    "@xcite has recently provided theoretical predictions for exoplanetary radii for a diverse range of possible exoplanetary compositions , including hot super - earth , and hot neptune planets .",
    "the super - earth models of @xcite agree well with the more detailed super - earth models of @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for our super - earth exoplanetary limits we use equation 7 and 8 of @xcite .",
    "our inner period limit of @xmath89 @xmath21 1.7@xmath2 allows us to rule out planets more massive than 1.3@xmath5 for a pure ice planet , 4.8@xmath5 for a pure rock planet , and 27@xmath5 for a pure iron planet .",
    "our outer period limit of @xmath89 @xmath21 3.5@xmath2 only allows to place a useful limit on pure ice super - earth planets . at this limit",
    "we are able to rule out planets more massive than 23@xmath5 for pure ice planets .",
    "pure rock and pure iron planets of this size are moderately less massive , and comparable in mass , respectively , to hd 189733b itself - planets of this mass , of course , have already been ruled out in this system with radial - velocity measurements ( @xcite as quoted in @xcite ) .",
    "we note that our limit on ice planets may be more sensitive than the limits quoted here as one would expect that ice planets at such small orbital periods would have steam atmospheres , and would thus be significantly inflated at these small orbital seperations @xcite .",
    "we are also able to place limits on the mass of hot neptune - type planets that have been ruled out in our analysis .",
    "hot neptune planets should have cores similar in density to giant ice - planets , and an outer atmosphere of h / he @xcite - they should thus be moderately less dense than giant - terrestrial ice planets , and thus be of a similar density to neptune in our own solar system @xcite .",
    "our inner period radius limit ( @xmath87 @xmath21 1.7@xmath2 ) excludes hot neptunes entirely , as hot neptune exoplanets are expected to be of similar size to neptune ( 3.9 @xmath2 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . at our outer period radius limit ( @xmath87 @xmath21 3.5@xmath2 )",
    "we can rule out hot neptune exoplanets more massive than 12.2  @xmath5 .",
    "the radius limits presented here , combined with the mass - limits from transit - timing analyses ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , place very firm constraints on the sizes and masses of bodies that could still reside in close orbits to hd 189733 .",
    "re - observations of this system planned with _",

    "hd 189733 thus joins the growing list of hot jupiter exoplanetary systems ( hd 209458 [ @xcite ] , tres-1 [ @xcite ] ) for which firm constraints have been placed on the size of other exoplanets in similar orbits to that of the known hot jupiter by a variety of methods .",
