    "technologies based on the use of reconfigurable ( photoinduced ) lattices , that have been implemented in photorefractive crystals @xcite and nematic liquid crystals @xcite , offer new ways to control gss in the spatial domain , by varying the lattice depth and spacings .    combining the benefits of phcs and solitons , gss have considerable potential for the use in photonics .",

    "bifurcations and stability of optical gss were analyzed in phcs with the local kerr nonlinearity pelinovsky2004 .",

    "however , for @xmath44 , which is very close to the edge of the first finite bandgap , the trend is completely different .",
    "this difference is explained by the known fact that gss with the propagation constant taken very close to edges of bandgaps are similar to the linear bloch waves in the linear lattice , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2](d ) .",
    "when the amplitude of the respective undulating tails in the gs shape is comparable to its main peak , the gaussian ansatz definitely fails .",

    "thus , the applicability condition for the gaussian - based va in the system with the self - defocusing nonlocal nonlinearity is clear : it is usable as long as the gs propagation constant is taken not too close to the bottom edge of the first finite bandgap .    in the extremely nonlocal regime ,",

    "although the strengthening nonlocality makes the gs shape sharper and stronger localized , we have found , somewhat counter - intuitively , that the on - site gs family is still stable , while its off - site counterpart is not , cf .",

    "it is this smoothness that stabilizes gss , for either sign of the nonlinearity .",

    "we have found that the gss become tighter localized in space , with a higher formation - power threshold .",
    "the results have been obtained in the numerical form and reproduced , with a reasonable accuracy , by the va ( variational approach ) . using the linear - stability analysis and calculating the pn ( peierls - nabarro ) potential barrier , we have demonstrated that the gss become not only more stable , but also more mobile , with the increase of the nonlocality .",

    "taking into regard the possibilities offered by the currently available technology for fabricating nonlocal nonlinear media with controllable properties , such as photorefractive crystals , nematic liquid crystals and thermo - optical materials , the results reported in this work may suggest new possibilities for the design of soliton - based photonic devices .",
