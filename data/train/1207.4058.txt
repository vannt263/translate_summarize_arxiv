    "in fact , after many years of theoretical investigations , the nature of the ground state of the spin-@xmath4 heisenberg model remains controversial on several two and three dimensional lattices .",
    "some of the most interesting states that can be stabilized at @xmath5 are called _ spin liquids _ and have no direct classical analogs .",
    "these systems remain rotationally invariant down to zero temperature .",
    "there is a whole zoo of possible spin liquids , and the most exotic one have low energy excitations which carry a half - odd - integer spin ( unlike conventional spin waves ) .",
    "there are rather few theoretical tools that are able to describe the limit of strong quantum fluctuations ( small @xmath6 ) for these systems , and spin liquid phases in particular . among them ,",
    "the so - called large-@xmath7 techniques , introduced by affleck for spin chains,@xcite play a central role . by generalizing the symmetry group of global spin rotations from su(2 ) to some larger group like su(@xmath7 ) or sp(@xmath8),@xcite the model",
    "can be solved in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "of course , the physics for @xmath10 needs not be simply related to that at @xmath9 .",
    "however , the success of these approaches is in part due to the fact that a number of interesting states that can be realized for su(2 ) models , also exist in the @xmath9 phase diagrams .",
    "in particular , the @xmath9 models are not restricted to have magnetically ordered ground state , and can have resonating valence - bond spin liquids ground states with fractionalized excitations and emerging gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , the effect of finite-@xmath7 corrections ( both perturbative@xcite and non - perturbative ones@xcite ) can be addressed .    in this work",
    "we consider a particular large-@xmath7 limit , the so - called schwinger boson mean field theory ( sbmft).@xcite it has been applied to many two - dimensional systems , such as the @xmath11 square,@xcite triangular,@xcite honeycomb@xcite , kagome,@xcite kagome with further neighbor interactions,@xcite or shastry - sutherland@xcite or cav@xmath12o@xmath13,@xcite lattices .",
    "this limit can in particular stabilize magnetically ordered ( nel ) states as well as @xmath14 spin liquids with gapped spinons.@xcite    the model contains @xmath7 flavors of spin-@xmath4 bosons ( spinons ) and the parameter which plays the role of the spin value @xmath15 is the number @xmath16 of bosons per site ( and per flavor ) . after performing a hubbard - stratonovich decoupling of the boson - boson interaction , the different boson flavors",
    "are coupled to a single complex field @xmath17 on each bond @xmath18 of the lattice .",
    "the formal ( gaussian ) integration of the spinons gives an effective action @xmath19 $ ] for the bond field .",
    "but the dependence in @xmath7 is simple since this action is that of the single - flavor problem multiplied by a factor @xmath7 : @xmath19=ns_{\\rm eff , 1}[a]$ ] .",
    "when @xmath7 is large it is therefore natural to perform a saddle point expansion . at the saddle point",
    "the bond - field fluctuations are frozen , and the effective hamiltonian is simply quadratic in the spinon operators .",
    "so the action can be computed with the help of a standard bogoliubov transformation . finding a the large-@xmath7 ground state",
    "thus amounts to solving a classical minimization problem .",
    "previous sbmft studies have mostly been focused on the ground state properties at @xmath9 .",
    "however , as a first step to understand the effects of finite-@xmath7 corrections , it is interesting to have access to the low - energy energy landscape of saddle points .",
    "although the system is locked into the lowest one when @xmath9 , the ( large but ) finite-@xmath7 physics must include some fluctuations between different low - energy saddle points , as well as some ( perturbative in @xmath20 ) fluctuations in the vicinity of each of these saddle points .",
    "our goal here is to provide a quantitative description of some excited saddle points .    in order to reduce the number of variables ,",
    "it is almost always assumed that the lowest - energy state preserves most ( or at least some ) of the lattice symmetries ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a notable exception ) . in practice",
    "most numerical studied have so far been restricted to solutions with a unit cell including a few sites only .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for the ground state , and we confirm validity in several cases .",
    "however , since we are interested here in excited saddle points , we need to be able to compute some _ spatially inhomogeneous _ states as well .",
    "we will however limit ourselves to time - independent solutions .    in this work",
    "perform some extensive numerical minimization to look for the ground state and low - energy excited states on clusters containing up to 144 sites .",
    "we compare the results we obtain on two different lattices ( square and triangular ) and for different values of the boson density ( `` spin '' ) @xmath16 .",

    "since it is quite difficult to perform an exhaustive search for mean field solutions if the number of parameters is extensive , the usual strategy is to decrease the number of bond variables by _ assuming _ that the ground state solution preserves some ( or all ) symmetries of the lattice .",
    "there are however some examples where the lowest energy solution spontaneously _ breaks _ some symmetries ( kagome clusters with 36 or 48 sites@xcite ) .",
    "we describe an algorithm to find saddle points ( self - consistent mean field state ) , local minima , and ( hopefully ) global energy minima .      for given values of the bond parameters @xmath17",
    ", one should first adjust the chemical potentials ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the basic idea is to perform a ( non - linear ) least - square minimization of @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a function of the chemical potentials .",
    "since each density @xmath82 is an increasing function of @xmath45 , this method converges relatively rapidly .",

    "@xmath84 is easy to compute using linear - response theory ( using the matrix which implements the bogolibov transformation , as well as the energies @xmath85 ) .",

    "finally we note that for some values of the bond parameters @xmath17 , there is no uncondensed state satisfying @xmath89 .",
    "if such a situation is encountered , we add some artificial energy penalty so that the energy - minimization algorithm ( next section ) tends to escape this point .",
    "equipped with a procedure to compute the @xmath45 as a function of the @xmath17 , we can start to look values of @xmath17 which correspond to self - consistent mean field states .",
    "the first stage is simply to iterate the bond self - consistency conditions in the usual way :    * we start from initial random bond values ( or perturbing a previously found solution ) . * after adjusting the @xmath86 by the procedure above , the ground state is obtained by bogoliubov transformation , and the expectation values @xmath90 are computed . *",
    "the bond parameters are replaced by the values above .",
    "the new bond parameters are gauge - transformed to a fixed gauge choice where a maximum number of bond parameters are set to be real .",
    "this avoids some possible slow drift of some complex phases of the @xmath17 which would be non - physical . *",
    "go back to step 2 until the bond parameters do not change by more than a small threshold @xmath91 .",
    "this method was used by hermele _",
    "et al._@xcite in a similar context .",
    "it is easy to check that local minima are attractive for these iterations while local maxima a repulsive .",
    "more precisely , the error will decrease ( resp .",

    "the convergence is faster if the hessian eigenvalues are large and positive .",
    "it practice , the iterations above allows to quickly go down in energy , but it is not efficient to achieve a full convergence when the system has more than @xmath92 10 bonds or so .",
    "indeed , it turns out that a high accuracy is required to resolve the possibly small differences ( bond modulations , etc ) between different saddle points .    to find accurately self - consistent state , the second stage amounts to perform a least - square optimization on @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is a function of the bond parameters",
    "of course , the expectation values @xmath95 are computed after the @xmath96 have been determined .",

    "the later is again obtained using linear - response theory , with the additional complexity that it contains some terms coming from the variation of the @xmath86 : @xmath99^{-1}_{ab } \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\langle\\hat n_b\\rangle}{\\partial a_{kl}}\\right|_{\\lambda{\\rm \\;fixed } } \\label{eq : dada}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as for the first stage , we work with bond variables corresponding to a fixed gauge choice .",
    "in particular , the matrix of eq .",
    "[ eq : dada ] is evaluated in the subspace of bond parameter variations which is orthogonal to pure gauge transformations .",
    "this is important to get rid of unphysical slow phase drifts during the iterations .",
    "most of the time a double precision accuracy in reached in less than 10 levenberg - marquart iterations when the system has less than one hundred bonds or so .",
    "finally the optimization is repeated using at least a few hundred ( often thousands ) of random initial conditions for the @xmath17 .",
    "this is relatively time consuming since each evaluation of the energy ( or its derivatives ) requires a numerical adjustment of the chemical potentials ( sec .",
    "[ ssec : dcp ] ) , which is itself a ( convex ) least - square problem with many variables .    varying the parameter @xmath91 ( stopping criterion for the iterations of stage 1 ) allows to tune if the method will converge toward very low - energy saddle points ( small @xmath91 ) , or saddle point at higher energy ( larger @xmath91 ) . if @xmath91 is very small ( say @xmath100 ) the first stage will terminate close to the ground state and the second step ( least - square ) will converge to the ground state with high probability if the system is not too large ( @xmath101 bonds ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath91 is too large , the first stage will stop at some relatively high energy configuration . in such region of the @xmath102 space",
    "we expect a very ( exponentially ) high density of saddle points . in practice",
    "this density of saddle point is so high that the program will find a new solution at every run , and a given saddle point will rarely be obtained twice .",
    "the best choice is to adjust @xmath91 so that the iteration stage leads to configurations in a typical energy range above the ground state where the number of saddle points is not too large ( a few tens ) .",
    "in such a case , after a sufficiently large number of runs , one obtains the full ( or almost full ) list of saddle points in that energy window . of course ,",
    "due to the large number of variables , one can not exclude the presence of some additional saddle points with a small basin of attraction with respect to this algorithm .",
    "the least - square procedure described above leads to self - consistent mean field states , satisfying @xmath103 .",

    "the sign of the smallest non - zero eigenvalue of @xmath108 tells us whether the mean field state is a local minimum , or an unstable saddle point .",
    "the spectrum of the hessian for the ground state gives some information about the magnitude of the @xmath20 corrections due to gaussian fluctuations in the vicinity of the energy minimum .",

    "still , both phases can be distinguished using standard finite size - scaling for the gap or spin - spin correlations .",

    "the ground state , as expected , is spatially uniform , real , and has a vanishing flux on all the square plaquettes , whatever the boson density .",

    "the transition very likely coincides with that of magnetic long - range order .",
