    "in the extensive literature devoted to the pricing and risk management of commodity derivatives , most investigations take as a starting point the specification of a price process for the commodity . the outcome of chance in the market in which the commodity is traded is usually modelled by a fixed probability space equipped with the filtration generated by a brownian motion of one or more dimensions , and it is typically assumed that the commodity price can be modelled as an ito process adapted to this filtration .",
    "such an approach to the pricing of commodities and related derivatives is in line with the  standard \" modelling framework for asset pricing , within which much of modern financial engineering has been carried out .",
    "a fundamental methodological issue arising in the standard framework is that the market filtration is fixed in an essentially _ ad hoc _ way , and that no indication is provided concerning the nature of the information it purports to convey , or why it is relevant to the price .",
    "the information is in practice typically no more than that of the price movements themselves , so it can hardly be claimed in any useful way that the price movements are taking place `` in response '' to `` shocks '' associated with the arrival of information .",
    "one knows , however , that in real markets , information concerning the possible future cash flows and other benefits or obligations linked to the physical possession of an asset can be crucial in the determination of trading decisions , even in situations where such information is of an imperfect nature .",
    "the movement of the price of an asset should thus be regarded as a _ derived _",
    "concept , induced by the flow of information to market participants .",
    "this is the point of view put forward in the information - based asset pricing framework of brody , hughston & macrina ( 2007 , 2008a , b ) that forms the analytical basis of the present investigation .",
    "the objective of this paper is in such a context to incorporate the role played by forward - looking information in commodity markets , and to derive a model for the prices that are used as underlyings in the valuation formulae for commodity derivatives . specifically , we make use of the concept of market information about future supply and demand as a basis for valuation of storable commodities . for a detailed treatment of theory of storage , convenience yield , and related concepts ,",
    "the reader can be referred to geman ( 2005 ) and references cited therein . in our approach",
    ", we shall assume that the possession of one standard unit of the commodity provides a `` convenience dividend '' equivalent to a cash flow @xmath0 .",
    "we thus work directly with the actual flow of benefit arising from the storage or possession of the commodity , rather than the percentage convenience yield .",
    "the point is that the percentage convenience yield is a secondary notion , since it depends on the price , which is what we are trying to determine . in what follows ,",
    "we present a simple model for the convenience dividend process @xmath1 . additionally , we introduce a market information process @xmath2 that provides partial or speculative information about the future dividend flow .",
    "the market filtration is then assumed to be generated jointly by these two processes . in that sense , we are explicitly constructing the market filtration in such a way that it contains information relevant to the commodity price . given the market filtration , the price of the commodity is taken to be the appropriately risk - adjusted discounted expected value of the totality of the future convenience dividends .",
    "we model @xmath1 by an ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "we model @xmath2 by a process that consists of two terms : a `` signal '' term containing information about the future convenience dividend flow , and a `` noise '' term given by an independent brownian motion . by use of this information - based model we are able to derive closed - form expressions for both the price of the commodity , and the prices of associated derivatives .    the paper is organised as follows . in  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we introduce our assumptions for the convenience dividend and for the market filtration . in  [ sec:3 ] various useful facts relating the ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process",
    "are recalled  in particular , certain features of the ou bridge .",
    "these are used in  [ sec:4 ] to show in proposition 1 that the information process and the convenience dividend rate are jointly markovian , and in  [ sec:5 ] to derive an expression for the commodity price .",
    "the resulting model is sufficiently tractable to allow for monte carlo simulations of the price process to be carried out . in  [ sec:6 ] we proceed to derive the stochastic differential equation satisfied by the price . in doing so , we are able to obtain an innovations representation for the associated filtering problem in closed form . in  [ sec:7 ]",
    "we work out pricing formulae for call options on the underlying spot price . in conclusion",
    ", the model is applied in  [ sec:8 ] to obtain the corresponding processes for futures prices , which are useful since futures contracts tend to be more commonly traded in commodities markets than the associated underlyings .",
    "in the information - based approach of brody _ et al_.  ( 2007 , 2008a , b ) , the starting point is the specification of : ( i ) a set of one or more random variables ( called `` market factors '' ) determining the cash flows associated with a given asset ; and ( ii ) a set of one or more random processes ( called `` information processes '' ) determining the flow of information to market participants concerning these market factors .",
    "the setup , more specifically , is as follows .",
    "we model the outcome of chance in a commodity market with the specification of a probability space @xmath3 .",
    "the market is not assumed to be complete , but we do assume the existence of a preferred pricing measure @xmath4 .",
    "then if @xmath1 represents the convenience dividend , the price of the commodity at time @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 ,   \\label{eq:1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expectation is taken with respect to @xmath4 . here the discount factor @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 in terms of the short rate @xmath9 .",
    "for simplicity , we shall assume that the default - free interest rate system is deterministic .",
    "the conditioning in ( [ eq:1 ] ) is taken with respect to the market filtration @xmath10 , which is generated jointly by : ( a ) the convenience dividend process @xmath11 ; and ( b ) a market information process @xmath12 of the form @xmath13 representing partial or noisy information about the future dividend flow .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 determines the rate at which information about the future dividend stream is revealed to the market .",
    "the @xmath4-brownian motion @xmath15 represents noise arising from rumour , baseless speculation , uninformed trading , and the like , and is assumed to be independent of the dividend process @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath17.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    our next modelling choice is to specify the form of the dividend process .",
    "we consider in this paper the case in which @xmath16 is an ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process .",
    "it is worth recalling , by way of contrast , that gibson & schwartz ( 1990 , 1991 ) assume that the percentage convenience yield should follow a mean - reverting process .",
    "the idea in the present work is that a mean - reverting absolute convenience dividend reflects the notion that in the long term there is an equilibrium rate of benefit obtained by storing the commodity .",
    "we thus assume that the dividend process satisfies a stochastic equation of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a @xmath4-brownian motion that is independent of @xmath15 .",
    "we allow for the possibility that the dividend rate may occasionally be negative .",
    "the mean reversion level @xmath20 , the reversion rate @xmath21 , and the dividend volatility @xmath22 are assumed to be constant in the present discussion , although the results can be readily generalised to the time - dependent cases .",
    "before we proceed to calculate the expectation ( [ eq:1 ] ) and hence work out the commodity value , it will be useful to remark on various properties of the ornstein - uhlenback process .",
    "these properties , some of which will be well known , but others perhaps less so , will help us simplify subsequent calculations .",
    "it is an elementary exercise to check that the solution to ( [ eq:4 ] ) is @xmath23 the gaussian process @xmath16 is characterised by its mean and auto - covariance , given by @xmath24 =   { \\mbox{$\\rm e$}}^{-\\kappa t } x_0 + \\theta ( 1-{\\mbox{$\\rm e$}}^{-\\kappa t } ) , \\quad   { \\rm cov}[x_t , x_t ] = \\frac{\\psi^2}{2\\kappa}\\ ,   { \\mbox{$\\rm e$}}^{-\\kappa t } ( { \\mbox{$\\rm e$}}^{\\kappa t } - { \\mbox{$\\rm e$}}^{- \\kappa t})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath25 .",
    "the ornstein - uhlenback process has the property that if we `` reinitialise '' the process at time @xmath5 then its value at some later time @xmath26 can be expressed in the form @xmath27 since @xmath16 is gaussian , by use of the variance - covariance relations one can verify that the random variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 are independent .",
    "this property corresponds to an orthogonal decomposition of the form @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "it should be evident that if the reversion rate is set to zero , then this relation reduces to the familiar independent - increments decomposition of a brownian motion .",
    "interestingly , there is another orthogonal decomposition of an ou process , somewhat less obvious than ( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "this is given by the identity @xmath32 the process @xmath33 defined for a fixed @xmath26 by @xmath34 appearing in ( [ eq:9 ] ) is an ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) bridge .",
    "the ou bridge interpolates between the fixed values @xmath35 and @xmath36 . by use of the covariance relations",
    ", one can check that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are independent , an important property that will be exploited in the calculation below . in figure [ fig:1a ]",
    "we show sample paths of the ou bridge , as well as for its mean and variance , which are given , respectively , by @xmath39 = \\frac{\\sinh(\\kappa(t - t))}{\\sinh(\\kappa t ) } x_0 + \\left [   1 - \\frac{\\sinh(\\kappa t)+\\sinh(\\kappa(t - t))}{\\sinh(\\kappa t ) } \\right ] \\theta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath40 = \\frac{\\psi^2}{2\\kappa } \\left [ \\frac{\\cosh(\\kappa t ) -   \\cosh(\\kappa(t-2t))}{\\sinh(\\kappa t ) } \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",

    "now it is an elementary property of brownian motion that for any times @xmath52 satisfying @xmath53 the random variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 are independent . more generally , for @xmath56 , we find that @xmath55 and @xmath57 are independent .",
    "bearing in mind that @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 but since @xmath60 and @xmath61 are independent of @xmath55 , @xmath62 , the markov property ( [ eq:15 ] ) follows .",

    "therefore @xmath70 is independent of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , from which the claimed result follows .",

    "\\label{eq:19 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one observes in particular that from the orthogonal decomposition ( [ eq:8 ] ) we can isolate the dependence of the commodity price on the current level of the convenience dividend rate @xmath28 .",
    "remarkably , this dependence turns out to be linear in our model .",
    "that is , we have the following relation : @xmath75 substituting this relation in equation ( [ eq:19 ] ) we thus obtain an expression of the form @xmath76 + { \\mathbb e }   \\left[\\left .",

    "note that the conditioning with respect to @xmath78 in the first term above drops out since @xmath79 and @xmath78 are independent by ( [ eq:8 ] ) .",

    "several interesting observations can be made regarding the weight factor @xmath102 given by ( [ eq:25 ] ) , which clearly lies between zero and one for all @xmath5 . for large @xmath22 and/or large @xmath14 , the value of @xmath102 tends to unity ; whereas for small @xmath22 and/or small @xmath14 , the value of @xmath90 tends to 0 .",
    "hence , if the market information has a low noise content , or if the volatility of the convenience dividend is high , then market participants also rely heavily on the information available about the future in their determination of the price , rather than assuming that the current value of the dividend is a good indicator for the future .",
    "conversely , in the absence of a strong signal concerning the future dividend flow , an annuity valuation based on the current dividend level will dominate the price .",
    "we see therefore that important intuitive characteristics are encoded explicitly in the pricing formula ( [ eq:26 ] ) .",
    "indeed , ( [ eq:26 ] ) captures rather well the idea of information - based asset pricing , showing how varying amounts of information about the future can affect the development of prices , and that prices typically represent a kind of compromise between what we know for sure at some given time , and the less trustworthy but nevertheless significant intelligence that we may possess regarding events that lay ahead .    in the special case for which",
    "the interest rate is constant , the valuation formula ( [ eq:26 ] ) simplifies somewhat to give the following : @xmath103 + z_{t}\\ , \\frac{{\\mbox{$\\rm e$}}^{rt}}{\\sigma t}\\ , \\xi_t ,   \\label{eq:27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the weight factors are @xmath104    we have performed monte carlo simulation studies to gain further intuition concerning the dynamical behaviour of the commodity price .",
    "furthermore , we have calibrated the model parameters to the prices of crude oil , and we have compared the resulting simulated sample paths to real market data . in the case of the crude oil markets we are able to estimate the expected long - term future spot price from historical average of spot prices , since there exists a supply - demand equilibrium price level to which the long - run price tend to converge .",
    "the results indicate that even in the constant - parameter model considered above , the model is sufficiently rich to capture elements of the behaviour of real market data , as illustrated in figure  [ fig:2 ] . indeed , the behaviour of the simulated sample paths is close to the actual price path in the real market , even though the model parameters are taken to be constant .    ,",

    "one of the advantages of the information - based approach is that one is effectively working in the space of solutions to a dynamical equation ; hence we have circumvented the often cumbersome process of solving differential equations .",
    "nevertheless , having obtained an explicit expression for the price it is of interest to identify the associated dynamical equation , which in turn gives us an expression for the innovations process , the underlying brownian motion that `` derives '' the price dynamics .",
