    "measurements of particle yields and kinematic distributions are an essential first step in exploring a new energy regime of particle collisions .",
    "such studies contribute to our understanding of the physics of hadron production and help construct a solid foundation for other investigations . in the complicated environment of lhc @xmath11 collisions  @xcite , such studies are needed to distinguish rare signal events from the much larger backgrounds of soft hadronic interactions .",
    "they will also serve as points of reference for pb - pb collisions in the lhc .",
    "soft collisions are commonly classified as elastic scattering , inelastic single - diffractive ( sd ) dissociation , double - diffractive ( dd ) dissociation , and inelastic non - diffractive ( nd ) scattering  @xcite .",
    "all presented results refer to inelastic non - single - diffractive ( nsd ) interactions .",
    "primary charged hadrons are defined to include decay products of particles with proper lifetimes less than 1  cm .",
    "products of secondary interactions and leptons are excluded .",
    "the observables reported here are @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the @xmath14 range  @xcite .",
    "the data for this study were recorded with the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) experiment  @xcite in december 2009 , during a few hours of the early lhc operation at @xmath15 and 2.36  tev .",
    "a detailed description of the cms experiment can be found in ref .",
    "the detectors used for the present analysis are the pixel and silicon - strip tracker ( sst ) , covering the region @xmath16 and immersed in a 3.8  t axial magnetic field .",
    "the pixel tracker consists of three barrel layers and two end - cap disks at each barrel end .",
    "the forward calorimeter ( hf ) , which covers the region @xmath17 , was also used for event selection .",
    "the detailed monte carlo simulation ( mc ) of the cms detector response is based on geant4 @xcite .",
    "the inelastic @xmath11 collision rate was about 3 - 11  hz . the fraction of the events in the data with more than one collision was less than @xmath18 and was neglected .",
    "any hit in the beam scintillator counters ( bsc , @xmath19 ) coinciding with colliding proton bunches was used for triggering the data acquisition .",
    "in addition , a reconstructed primary vertex ( pv ) was required using the tracker , together with at least one hf tower in each end with more than 3  gev total energy .",
    "the fraction of beam - halo and other beam - background events were suppressed below @xmath20 .",
    "the number of selected events was finally 40,320 and 10,837 at 0.9 and 2.36  tev , respectively .",
    "the event selection efficiency was estimated with simulated events using the pythia  @xcite and phojet  @xcite event generators .",
    "the relative event fractions of sd , dd , and nd processes and their respective event selection efficiencies are different for the two models , but the estimated fractions of sd events in the selected data samples are similar : 5.2% ( 4.9% ) at 0.9  tev and 6.3% ( 5.0% ) at 2.36  tev for pythia ( phojet ) , respectively .",
    "the selection efficiency of nsd processes as a function of multiplicity , and the above fraction of sd events are corrected for .",
    "the @xmath12 distributions were obtained with three methods , based on counting the following quantities : ( i ) reconstructed clusters in the barrel part of the pixel detector ; ( ii ) pixel tracklets composed of pairs of clusters in different pixel barrel layers ; and ( iii ) tracks reconstructed in the full tracker volume .",
    "the third method also allows a measurement of the @xmath13 distribution .",
    "all these methods rely on the reconstruction of a pv  @xcite .",
    "the three methods are sensitive to the measurement of particles down to @xmath0 values of about 30 , 50 , and 100  mev/@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the measurements were corrected for the geometrical acceptance , efficiency , fake and duplicate tracks , low-@xmath0 particles curling in the axial magnetic field , decay products of long - lived hadrons and photon conversions and inelastic hadronic interactions in the detector material .",
    "the pythia d6 t tune was chosen to determine the corrections .",
    "for the measurement of the @xmath21 distribution , charged - particle tracks with @xmath22  gev/@xmath5 were used in 12 different @xmath23 bins , from 0 to 2.4 .",
    "the average charged - hadron yields in nsd events are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra]a as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath23 .",
    "the tsallis parametrization @xcite ,    @xmath24    was fitted to the data . the @xmath0 spectrum of charged hadrons measured in the range @xmath14 , is shown in fig .  [ fig : spectra]b for data at 0.9 and 2.36  tev .",
    "the average @xmath0 , calculated from a combination of the measured data points and the low- and high-@xmath0 contributions as determined from the fit , is @xmath25  gev/@xmath5 and @xmath26  gev/@xmath5 at 0.9 and 2.36  tev , respectively .",
    "experimental uncertainties related to the trigger and event selection are common to all the analysis methods .",
    "the uncertainty related to the presence of sd and dd events in the final sample was estimated to be 2% , based on consistency checks between data and simulation for diffractive event candidates . the total event selection uncertainty , which also includes the selection efficiency of the bsc and hf , was found to be 3% .",
    "additional 3% and 2% uncertainties were assigned to the tracklet and track reconstruction algorithm efficiencies , respectively .",
    "corrections at the percent level were applied to the final results to extrapolate to @xmath27 . the uncertainty on these extrapolation corrections",
    "was found to be less than 1% .",
    "the final systematic uncertainties for the pixel counting , tracklet , and track methods were found to be 5.4% , 4.9% , and 4.0% , respectively , and are strongly correlated .     in @xmath28-unit - wide bins of @xmath23 for the 2.36  tev data .",
