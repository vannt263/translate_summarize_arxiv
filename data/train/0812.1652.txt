    "two families of black holes have been observed so far : stellar  mass black holes are seen in x  ray binaries , while black holes with masses @xmath1@xmath2 are ubiquitous in the centers of galaxies , sometimes revealing themselves as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the large mass gap between the two families is still scarcely populated .",
    "dynamical evidence for a black hole with mass @xmath3 has been reported in the g1 globular cluster ( gebhardt , rich & ho 2005 ) and a black hole with a mass of @xmath4 may be present in omega centauri as well ( noyola et al . 2008 ) . as for agn ,",
    "a limited number of low luminosity seyfert  like active galaxies has been shown to harbour intermediate  mass black holes ( imbh , arbitrarily defined here as black holes in galaxy centers with @xmath5 ) .",
    "ngc  4395 is a late  type spiral with no bulge component and small central stellar velocity dispersion ( filippenko & ho 2003 ) which exhibits broad permitted optical / uv emission lines , a compact radio core , and a highly variable point  like x  ray source unambiguously pointing towards a seyfert identification ( filippenko , ho & sargent 1993 ; ho & ulvestad 2001 ; ho et al 2001 ; vaughan et al 2005 ) .",
    "mass estimates from the h@xmath6 line width",
    " luminosity relationship ( filippenko & ho 2003 ) and from x  ray variability ( vaughan et al 2005 ) suggest a bh of @xmath7 , consistent with the upper limit ( @xmath8 ) inferred from the @xmath9@xmath10 relation , but slightly lower than the bh mass of @xmath11 , obtained through reverberation mapping ( peterson et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the dwarf elliptical pox  52 also exhibits seyfert  1 like broad and narrow emission lines ( kunth , sargent & bothun 1987 ; barth et al .",
    "2004 ) and the estimate of the bh mass obtained via the h@xmath6 line width  luminosity relationship and the @xmath9@xmath10 relationship point toward a bh of the order of @xmath8 .",
    "the main difference in the agn properties of the two imbh is that ngc  4395 is a low eddington ratio source ( @xmath12 ) , while pox  52 appears to be radiating at nearly its maximum rate . finally , the dwarf seyfert  1 sdss  j160531.84 + 174826.1 has a relatively broad h@xmath13 line component which suggests ( via luminosity and line width ) a black hole mass of @xmath14 ( dong et al .",
    "2007b ) .",
    "greene & ho ( 2004 ) have defined a sample of 19 imbh candidates in agn using the first data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . given the adopted selection criteria ( low bh mass and prominent agn  like spectrum ) the sample mostly comprises objects with high eddington ratio .",
    "the greene & ho work was recently extended to the fourth data release by dong et al ( 2007a ) and greene & ho ( 2007b ) who have increased the sample of imbh by about one order of magnitude .",
    "interestingly , about 15 per cent of the larger sample(s ) are suspected to have eddington ratios below 10 per cent .",
    "due to selection criteria , and with the exception of ngc  4395 , all agn with imbh are actually radiating a very significant fraction of their eddington luminosity .",
    "the presence of relatively low eddington ratio sources in the new sample(s ) will make it possible to investigate ngc  4395like nuclei in the future , opening a new important window on imbh activity .",
    "the original smaller greene & ho sample ( hereafter the gh sample ) has been studied in the x  rays by making use of 5  ks long _ chandra _ snapshot observations ( greene & ho 2007a ) .",
    "the sample is characterized by x ",
    "ray luminosities in the range of @xmath15@xmath16  erg  s@xmath17 in the soft 0.52  kev x  ray band and the soft x ",
    "ray spectral properties are consistent with those of more luminous sources harbouring more massive black holes , showing that black hole mass is certainly not one of the main drivers of soft x ",
    "rays spectral properties .    here",
    "we report results from _ xmm  newton _ 40  ks  long observations of four of the imbhs from the gh sample which were previously detected in the rosat all sky survey .",
    "the larger effective area and longer exposure of these observations with respect to the _ chandra _ snapshots allow us to consider in some detail the x  ray spectral properties of these imbh also above 2  kev , and to compare them with their more massive and more luminous counterparts ( e.g. the pg quasars ) .",
    "moreover , we were able to also study their x  ray variability properties filling ( although with only four objects ) a relatively poorly studied range in black hole masses .",
    "very recently , the four observations we consider here have been included in a submitted work by dewangan et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "their analysis is mainly devoted to ngc  4395 and pox  52 .",
    "as for the common sources , the main difference with our work is that we focus much more our study on the spectral analysis and soft excess , exploring different possible models and interpretations , and comparing the x  ray properties of the four objects with agn powered by accretion onto much more massive black holes .",
    "all observations were performed with the epic  pn camera operated in full frame mode . in table   1",
    "we report the source i d ( see greene & ho 2004 for i d definition ) , redshift , and galactic column density .",
    "all observations were affected by high background periods .",
    "these were removed before performing spectral analysis and the resulting net exposure is reported in table  1 .",
    "due to high radiation affecting the observations of gh  12 , the source has been observed three times ( a , b , and c in table  1 and hereafter ) .",
    "spectra have been rebinned so that each energy bin contains at least 20 counts to allow us to use the @xmath18 minimisation technique in spectral fitting .",
    ".information on the observed sources and observations .",
    "the short exposure gh  12b does not allow to obtain good quality spectra above @xmath19  3  kev and is not considered further . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     because of the above limitations , it is not our purpose here to repeat the oneill et al analysis ( as we can not constrain the parameters of the model any better ) , but in order to compare the imbh variability properties with more massive objects , we consider a sample of 27 radio  quiet seyfert 1 galaxies observed with _",
    "xmm  newton _ plus our 4 imbhs and compute the excess variance by using light ",
    "curve segments of equal duration ( @xmath20  ks ) and equal time bin size ( @xmath21  s ) in the 210  kev band for all sources .",
    "the sample was selected from the available sources ( with known / estimated black hole mass ) in the _ xmm  newton _ public archive with observations longer than 20  ks .",
    "the sample is by no means homogeneous nor complete and results are reported here for comparison with the imbh only . if observations longer than 20  ks ( or multiple observations ) are available for a given source , the excess variance has been estimated as the mean over the excess variances obtained from the 20  ks intervals and errors are computed taking into account the measurement errors , and also the uncertainties associated with red  noise ( vaughan et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the case of gh  12 , we used observation gh  12a only , and we imposed a slightly less conservative background cut than for the spectral analysis in order to obtain a 20  ks segment of the 210  kev light curve ( we checked that the different cut does not affect the excess variance significantly ) .",
    "the excess variances and black hole masses used here are reported in table  5 . in fig .",
    "8 , we show the resulting @xmath22@xmath23 relationship , showing that the excess variance of our imbhs ( filled squares ) smoothly joins with that of more massive sources .",
    "such behaviour is consistent with that generally predicted by the universal psd model , although with the model limitations discussed above ( see e.g. fig .  2 in oneill et al 2005 ) and",
    "we conclude that the imbh x  ray variability properties do not differ significantly from those of more massive seyfert galaxies . only extending the available data to black hole masses below @xmath24",
    "would better define the relationship in the most crucial low ",
    "mass end where , according to the universal psd model , the excess variance is expected to significantly deviate from the anti  correlation ( and actually to nearly saturate if , as results from ark  564 indicate , the low frequency break in agn is @xmath25 ) .",
    "we have observed with _ xmm",
    " newton _ 4 imbh from the original sample of 19 objects selected by greene & ho ( 2004 ) from the sdss .",
    "the x  ray properties of the imbh considered here do not significantly differ from those of their more massive counterparts such as the pg quasars .",
    "the imbhs could represent a population of not yet fully grown super  massive black holes and , if in a rapid growing phase , their accretion properties would be expected to significantly depart from those of standard and fully  grown accreting supermassive black holes . however , as already suggested by their eddington ratios ( high because of the sample selection strategy , but not that unusual ) , their accretion properties are in all respect similar to those of more massive agn and quasars .",
    "the x  ray spectra of our objects are characterized by the same x  ray slope as pg quasars in both the hard and soft x  ray bands .",
    "no ( neutral ) absorption in excess of the galactic one is observed in any of the objects .",
    "three out of four objects exhibit a soft excess with the same properties ( uniform temperature and strength ) as larger black hole mass samples ( standard seyfert  1 and quasars ) .",
    "this is surprising if one considers that the small black hole mass of the imbhs should allow thermal emission from the accretion disc to dominate the soft x ",
    "ray band , producing soft x ",
    "ray spectra that should significantly depart from those of more massive objects in which the disc quasi  blackbody emission is expected to contribute in the uv only .",
    "this is however not observed , and if the soft excess is interpreted as thermal disc emission , the inferred temperature in agn with black hole masses of @xmath26 is the same as that of quasars with black hole masses two ( or more ) orders of magnitude larger .",
    "so far , the so  called soft excess problem was mainly defined as the fact that we observe soft x ",
    "ray emission in accreting supermassive black hole which is too hot ( and too uniform ) to be reasonably associated with thermal disc emission . here , we point out that the problem is even more puzzling : when we observe sources in which thermal disc emission",
    "should largely extend into the soft x  ray band ( such as the imbh ) , we see exactly the same spectral shape as in more massive agn and , if these imbh were rotating ( kerr ) , the inferred temperature would even be too cold to be associated with the accretion disc .",
    "gierliski & done ( 2004 ) proposed that the soft excess is an artifact due to absorption ( of an intrinsic steep power law spectrum ) by partially ionized gas in the form of a highly relativistic wind .",
    "since the observed smoothness of the soft excess is not consistent with the expected sharp absorption features , the model requires the gas to be characterized by strong velocity gradients to smear them out via doppler smearing .",
    "the large velocity gradients , most likely imply that the wind is launched very close to the black hole .    as mentioned by schurch & done ( 2006 ) , the wind model described above is unlikely to be a standard uv  line driven disc wind , because such winds are preferentially produced at @xmath27 of the axis , which is in contrast with the observational fact that most low ",
    "inclination seyfert 1 galaxies exhibit a soft excess",
    ". moreover , the mass outflow rate ( @xmath28 ) inferred from the large final velocities required by the model is generally hundreds times larger than the mass accretion rate ( @xmath29 ) in among the most luminous x  ray sources in the universe ( but see the idea of a failed wind proposed by schurch & done 2006 ) .",
    "more recently , schurch & done ( 2007 ) have shown that when a more detailed smearing profile is adopted , the shape of the model does not describe well the observed smoothness of the soft excess , casting severe doubts on the overall model .",
    "in addition , here we have shown that , even if the smeared absorption model can reproduce the spectral shape , the uniform soft excess strength is obtained only if a tight correlation between column density and ionization parameter is enforced .",
    "the @xmath30 correlation inferred from fitting the smeared absorption model to x  ray data is however not a natural product of photo  ionization and is most likely spurious , either due to a degeneracy in the parameter space ( which implies the model does not provide any constraint on the absorber properties ) or , as mentioned above , to the need of producing a uniform soft excess strength in sources which do require different column densities .",
    "the smearing of the reflection features by high velocities is a natural consequence of the presence of an inner accretion disc .",
    "undoubtedly , an inner accretion disc must exists in sources accreting above a few per cent of the eddington ratio and thus , unlikely the smeared absorption model , the disc reflection model does not introduce any new ( so far unobserved , if not for the soft excess interpretation itself ) component to explain the soft excess .",
    "the reflection interpretation just makes use of the basic ingredients of accretion theory , a powerful primary source of hard x ",
    "rays , and an optically thick accretion disc which reprocesses the irradiating flux into a reflection spectrum .",
    "an additional external absorber may obviously mask this contribution and this may well be the case in some most extreme sources . however , since disc reflection only requires the presence of an inner accretion disc and of an illuminating x  ray source",
    ", it is an unavoidable component in any reasonable accretion model for radiatively efficient agn ( and x  ray binaries ) .",
    "in fact ( see e.g. middleton , done & gierliski 2007 ) when the smeared absorption model is applied to pg quasars and nls1s , it always does require also a disc reflection component . if the disc reflection component alone can account for the spectral shape and variability of the sources , it is difficult to understand the need for an additional smeared absorber with problematic launching mechanism , extreme mass outflow rate , and rather unnatural relationship between column density and ionization .",
    "since disc reflection invokes the presence of the accretion disc down to the last stable orbit , thermal emission from the disc should also be present and , given the small black hole masses and relatively high accretion rates in our imbhs , such emission should peak in the soft x  rays .",
    "indeed , when a multicolor disc blackbody is included in the spectral models , a solution in which the soft excess is partly due to reflection and partly to disc blackbody with the theoretically expected temperature is found .",
    "however , we point out that if thermal disc emission is present in the soft x  ray spectrum of these objects , its luminosity is far below the expected one for the given temperatures not only when reflection is invoked , but even when all the soft excess is modelled as a pure disc blackbody .",
    "it is actually difficult to distinguish between the two competing models ( smeared absorption and disc reflection ) by using spectral and variability information in the limited band  pass of _ xmm  newton _",
    "( 0.310  kev band ) even in bright , well observed sources .",
    "moreover , our mini  sample of small mass bh is not well suited to investigate the problem due to the relatively low quality of the data . high ",
    "energy data are crucial to test whether the x  ray spectrum above 10  kev is just the high  energy unabsorbed tail of the intrinsic power law continuum , or whether it is instead characterized by the presence of a compton hump around 2030  kev , related to x  ray reflection . while signatures for the presence of x  ray reflection from the inner accretion disc are sometimes detected , the number of well observed sources above 10  kev is still too small to draw any clear  cut conclusion ( e.g. miniutti et al 2007 ; reeves et al 2007 ) .",
    "observations with the _ suzaku _ x  ray mission and with future missions such as simbol  x ( ferrando et al . 2006 ) will most likely play a crucial role in that direction in the near future .      given their relatively small black hole mass ( i.e. small size ) ,",
    "the observed imbh are not surprisingly among the most variable in x  rays .",
    "in particular , their excess variance @xmath31 is among the largest obtained from agn x  ray light curves .",
    "our observations begin to fill a relatively poorly explored range of black hole masses in the @xmath31@xmath32 relationship and show that the x  ray variability properties of imbh smoothly join with those of more massive seyfert galaxies .",
    "the @xmath33@xmath32 is consistent with a simple ( well known ) anti  correlation that can be explained with a universal psd model in which the break frequencies ( most importantly the high  frequency one ) scale with @xmath34 .",
    "however , such functional form for @xmath35 is known to be only a zeroth  order approximation ( see m@xmath36hardy et al 2006 ) and the universal psd model suffers also for other uncertainties that do not allow to properly account for the scatter in the relationship .",
    "future longer observations of these and other imbh in x  rays would allow to explicitly search for the high frequency break in the psd , enabling us to extend the @xmath37@xmath32@xmath38 relationship pointed out by m@xmath36hardy et al ( 2006 ) to the most crucial black hole mass range of @xmath39 .",
