    "the classification of minimal , complex surfaces @xmath3 of general type with small birational invariants is still far from being achieved ; nevertheless , the study of such surfaces has produced in the last years a considerable amount of results , see for instance the survey paper @xcite .",
    "if we assume @xmath4 , that is @xmath5 , and @xmath3 _ irregular _ , that is @xmath6 , then the inequalities of bogomolov - miyaoka - yau and debarre imply @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath8 then @xmath3 is a product of curves of genus 2 , as shown by beauville in the appendix to @xcite , while the case @xmath9 was understood through the work of several authors , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the classification becomes more and more complicated as the value of @xmath10 decreases ; indeed already for @xmath11 one has only a partial understanding of the situation .",
    "let us summarize what is known for surfaces with @xmath0 in terms of @xmath12 ; in this case the inequalities mentioned above yield @xmath13 .",
    "the case @xmath14 was investigated by the first author , who constructed three families of surfaces which admit an isotrivial fibration , see @xcite .",
    "previously , surfaces with these invariants were also studied by ciliberto and mendes - lopes ( in connection with the problem of birationality of the bicanonical map , see @xcite ) and manetti ( in his work on the severi conjecture , see @xcite ) . for @xmath15",
    "there were so far only two examples , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as the title suggests , the present work deals with this case . for @xmath16",
    "there is only one example , see again @xcite .",
    "the study of the case @xmath17 was started by zucconi in @xcite and continued by the first author in @xcite .",
    "they produced a complete classification of surfaces with @xmath0 and @xmath17 which are isogenous to a product of curves ; as a by - product , they obtained the classification of all surfaces with these invariant which are not of albanese general type , i.e. , such that the image of the albanese map is a curve .",
    "finally , for @xmath18 and @xmath19 there are hitherto no examples known .    in this article",
    "we consider surfaces with @xmath0 and @xmath20 .",
    "our work started when we noticed that the surfaces constructed in @xcite and @xcite have many features in common .",
    "more precisely , in both cases the albanese map @xmath21 is a generically finite triple cover , and the albanese variety @xmath22 is an abelian surface with a polarization of type @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 contains a @xmath24-curve , which is obviously contracted by @xmath25",
    ". we shall prove that penegini s and chen - hacon s examples actually belong to the same connected component of the moduli space of surfaces of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath15 .    in order to formulate our results ,",
    "let us introduce some terminology .",
    "let @xmath3 be a minimal surface of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath15 , such that its albanese map @xmath26 is a generically finite morphism of degree @xmath27 .",
    "if one considers the stein factorization of @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath28 then the map @xmath29 is a flat triple cover , which can be studied by applying the techniques developed in @xcite . in particular , @xmath30 is determined by a rank @xmath31 vector bundle @xmath32 on @xmath22 , called the _ tschirnhausen bundle _ of the cover , and by a global section @xmath33 . in the examples of @xcite and",
    "@xcite the surface @xmath34 is singular ; nevertheless in both cases the numerical invariants of @xmath32 are the same predicted by the formulae of @xcite , as if @xmath34 were smooth .",
    "this leads us to introduce the definition of _ negligible singularity _ for a triple cover , which is similar to the corresponding well - known definition for double covers , see definition [ def.neg.sing ] .",
    "then , inspired by the construction in @xcite , we say that @xmath3 is a _ chen - hacon surface _ if there exists a polarization @xmath35 of type @xmath36 on @xmath37 such that @xmath38 is the fourier - mukai transform of the line bundle @xmath39 , see definition [ def.gch ] .",
    "our first main result is the following characterization of chen - hacon surfaces , see proposition [ prop.ch ] and theorem [ teo.ch ] .",
    "let @xmath3 be a minimal surface of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath15 such that the albanese map @xmath40 is a generically finite morphism of degree @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the stein factorization of @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath3 is a chen - hacon surface if and only if @xmath34 has only negligible singularities .",
    "moreover , we can completely describe all the possibilities for the singular locus of @xmath34 , see proposition [ prop.quadruple ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath34 is never smooth , since it always contains a cyclic quotient singularity of type @xmath42 .",
    "therefore @xmath3 always contains a @xmath24-curve , which turns out to be the fixed part of the canonical system @xmath43 , see proposition [ prop.canonical ] .",
    "now let @xmath44 be the moduli space of surfaces with @xmath0 and let @xmath45 be the subset whose points parametrize ( isomorphism classes of ) chen - hacon surfaces .",
    "our second main result is the following , see theorem [ teo.moduli ] .",
    "@xmath46 is an irreducible , connected , generically smooth component of @xmath44 of dimension @xmath2 .    since chen and hacon constructed in @xcite",
    "only the _ general _ surface in @xmath46 , we need considerable work in order to establish theorem b. our proof uses in an essential way the fact that the degree of the albanese map is a topological invariant of @xmath3 , see @xcite . as a by - product",
    ", we obtain some results of independent interest about the embedded deformations of @xmath3 in the projective bundle @xmath47 , see proposition [ prop.h.unobstructed ] .",
    "we believe that the interest of our paper is twofold .",
    "first of all , it provides the first construction of a connected component of the moduli space of surfaces of general type with @xmath0 , @xmath15 .",
    "secondly , theorem b shows that every small deformation of a chen - hacon surface is still a chen - hacon surface ; in particular , no small deformation of @xmath3 makes the @xmath24-curve disappear .",
    "moreover , since @xmath46 is generically smooth , the same is true for the first - order deformations .",
    "by contrast , burns and wahl proved in @xcite that first - order deformations always smooth all the @xmath48-curves , and catanese used this fact in @xcite in order to produce examples of surfaces of general type with everywhere non - reduced moduli spaces .",
    "theorem b demonstrates rather strikingly that the results of burns - wahl and catanese can not be extended to the case of @xmath24-curves and , as far as we know , provides the first explicit example of this situation .    although theorems a and b shed some light on the structure of surfaces with @xmath0 and @xmath15 , many questions still remain unanswered . for instance :    * are there surfaces with these invariants whose albanese map has degree different from @xmath27 ? * are there surfaces with these invariants whose albanese map has degree @xmath27 , but which are not chen - hacon surfaces ? because of theorem a ,",
    "this is the same to ask whether @xmath34 may have non - negligible singularities .    and , more generally :    * how many connected components of the moduli space of surfaces with @xmath0 and @xmath15 are there ?",
    "in order to answer the last question , it would be desirable to find an effective bound for the degree of @xmath40 , but so far we have not been able to do this .",
    "another problem that arises quite naturally and which is at present unsolved is the following .",
    "* what are the possible degenerations of chen - hacon surfaces ?",
    "an answer to this question would be a major step toward a compactification of @xmath46 . in proposition [ reducible ]",
    "we give a partial result , analyzing some degenerations of the triple cover @xmath49 which provide reducible , non - normal surfaces .",
    "now let us describe how this paper is organized . in section [ sec.preliminaries ]",
    "we present some preliminaries , and we set up notation and terminology .",
    "in particular we recall miranda s theory of triple covers , introducing the definition of negligible singularity , and we discuss the geometry of @xmath50-polarized abelian surfaces . for the reader",
    "s convenience , we recall the relevant material from @xcite and @xcite without proofs , thus making our exposition self - contained .    in section [ sec.vec ] , which is the technical core of the paper , we describe all possibilities for the tschirnhausen bundle of the triple cover @xmath51 .",
    "the analysis is particularly subtle in the case where the @xmath52-polarization is of product type ; eventually , we are able to rule out this case , showing that it gives rise to a surface @xmath34 which is not of general type ( see corollaries [ cor.nonsimple ] and [ cor.simple ] ) .    in section [ sec.degree.3 ] we briefly explain the two examples from @xcite and @xcite , which motivate our definition of chen - hacon surfaces . the properties of such surfaces are then investigated in detail in section [ sec.ch ] .    finally , in section [ sec.main.thm ] we prove theorem a , whereas section [ sec.moduli ] deals with the proof of theorem b.    * acknowledgments . *",
