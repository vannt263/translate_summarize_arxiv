    "this function also defines a measure of nonlocality by the associated `` response function '' , @xmath9 .",
    "the latter is related to _",
    "local changes _ in the inhomogeneity .",
    "for instance , if the inhomogeneity changes abruptly ( e.g. , as a step function ) between neighbouring sites , the response function is a dirac s delta function , meaning that the nonlinear response is highly local . as the inhomogeneity transitions are smoother , the response function becomes broader : the nonlinearity becomes nonlocal .",
    "evidently , nonlocality depends also on the relative scales of the response function to the wavefunction profile . for this reason , @xmath60 linearly weights the one - particle wavefunction over overlapping nearby sites . in the dlqc",
    "( eq . [ dlqc ] ) , on the other hand , nonlocality is represented by the scaled variance in the distances in `` atomic patch - picture '' , given by eq .",

    "the larger the variance , the larger the coefficient of the nonlinear term .",

    "@xcite , which is the type of local nonlinearity that we are considering here ) , is missing the proposal of the dlqc ( eq . [ dlqc ] ) , given originally in ref . @xcite . on the other hand , in the exact limit ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) ,",
    "the dnnse becomes the dnse ( eq .",
    "[ dnse ] ) , but this would be true for the dlqc only if the nonlinear / local term @xmath65 is introduced in that equation as well . here",
    "consider that is so , and the relevant mapping is :    @xmath68    instead of considering specific realizations of that mapping , let us qualitatively analyse two extreme cases for the response function :    1 if the inhomogeneities change very smoothly from site to site ( `` weak coupling transition '' ) , the response function is broad relatively to the wavefunction , but it also has almost negligible amplitude . in this case , the first term in the nonlinear coefficient of the dnnse ( inside the large parenthesis in eq . [ dnnse ] ) will dominate the second ( nonlocal ) term , and the resulting coefficient would be `` weakly nonlocal '' ( `` mostly local '' ) , say :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 and the function @xmath71 is very small for all @xmath59 .",
    "the variance ( eq . ( [ eq_delta_n ] ) ) representing the nonlocal contribution in the dlqc ( eq . [ dlqc ] ) would also be very small .",
    "the dnnse and the dlqc would then give qualitatively similar evolutions , if this appropriately tuned regime meets the mapping requirement given by eq .",
    "[ resp_map2 ] .",
    "2 if the inhomogeneities , despite being of small amplitude throughout , change abruptly from site to site , in a discretized manner ( `` quasi - homogeneity '' with `` strong coupling transition '' ) , then the response function will be characterized by a series of delta functions ( a `` dirac comb '' ) and the nonlinearity will be locally modulated by the wavefunction profile . in other words , for a given @xmath59 ( and @xmath70 ) :    @xmath72    and the local nonlinearity is enforced by a scaling factor @xmath73 . the same effect for the dlqc ( eq . [ dlqc ] ) does not seem obvious , as this equation considers inhomogeneities , _ but not how they locally connect_.    the above considerations point to the possibility that the dnnse ( eq . [ dnnse ] ) encodes in a more general way the effects of nonlocality through the response function , with the appropriate scaling given by the inhomogeneity function . although we did not give a rigorous proof that both equations ( eqs .",
    "[ dlqc ] and [ dnnse ] ) correspond to similar evolutions , in appropriate conditions , our a qualitative evaluation seems reasonable .",
    "the precise validity of those assumptions would require a numerical analysis , which goes beyond the present scope of the paper .      in the change of perspective from condensed matter to quantum cosmology",
    ", the _ continuous _ nnse ( eq . [ nnse ] ) would be equivalent to a `` mesoscopic '' space - time patching model .",
    "the main idea is to consider the nnse as an _ effective _ description of inhomogeneous lqc , supposedly arising from unknown microscopic quantum degrees of freedom in a full lqg theory .",
    "any applications of the nnse in such a context must be compatible with consistency conditions imposed by covariance and quantum state properties arising in quantum cosmology @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , so these will be discussed in the next subsection .    in the nnse",

    "in other words , once the inhomogeneity is defined , a semiclassical quantum state is selected in this interpretation .    evidently , the existence of exact solutions ( either soliton or geometric - based , c.f .",
    "[ soliton_sol][soliton_q ] ; theorems [ t1 ] , [ t2 ] ) is a technical advantage in the sense that they can be treated and manipulated immediately in the theory , and be compared , e.g. , with independent numerical investigations ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the availability of a well - defined way in which the nnse state evolves ( exact solutions ) , even in the more complicated scenario of a time - dependent inhomogeneity function ( c.f .",
    "theorem [ t1 ] ) , offers an interesting opportunity for investigation .",
    "such a description may hold at high curvature regimes , e.g. , under an adequately modeled nonlocality ( expressed in terms of the inhomogeneity response function , see sec .",
    "[ sub_non ] ) .    for soliton solutions , one may interpret that dynamical trajectories follow mean values in the given semiclassical quantum state .",
    "a systematic study of such evolutions may provide a qualitative basis for indicating expectation values of physical observables which may deviate from classical solutions .",
    "another important issue is the fact that effective equations in general offer an approximation to a full quantum dynamics for highly peaked states .",
    "the nnse - based models associated with soliton solutions ( eqs . [ soliton_sol][soliton_q ] ) may offer consistent alternatives to peaked states other than gaussians , where there is no clear underlying justification in the quantum cosmology setting @xcite .",
    "as any mathematical equation , parameters of nnse solutions can be changed arbitrarily , and by themselves do not give any predictions : they are tuned according to the application . therefore in specific applications ,",
    "the nnse variables @xmath74 should be interpreted accordingly in the space of expected values .",
    "for example , position @xmath75 may represent the physical volume @xmath76 of a `` microscopic '' cell of a classical spatial manifold , and some physical variable may play the role of an `` emergent physical time '' , say , the cosmological scalar factor @xmath77 .",
    "the corresponding interpretation , however , is not simple @xcite .",
    "the nnse solution in this case is assumed to represent a semiclassical state , @xmath78 , of a consistent and gauge invariant quantum cosmology model .",
    "that is , @xmath78 would represent an approximation to a state that can be written in terms of the eigenfunctions of the dynamical evolution operator , characterizing the corresponding discrete model ( in this case , the dnnse , eq . [ dnnse ] ) . however , these eigenfunctions need not to be known for constructing our space - time patching model , as the nnse solutions are readily interpreted as representing a semiclassical quantum cosmological state .",
    "this is an assumption of the modeling , which nevertheless may lead to a starting point for a phenomenological framework to quantum cosmology .",
