    "<S> the house price distributions of taiwan are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the tail of the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) follows an approximate power law with an exponent equals to -2.4 while the distribution of the house price per unit area displays a lognormal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> implications of the results are also discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> many complex systems exhibit heavy - tailed distributions in observables that characterize the systems . among them are natural hazards such as earthquakes , landslides , wildfires @xcite or the ranking of words used in literature @xcite . in a recent work @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it was realized that the tail of the house price distribution in the greater tokyo area differs significantly from a lognormal distribution as would have been assumed by many people , and in fact display a power law behavior . </S>",
    "<S> one would want to ask if this kind of behavior is universal or just a special case related to the greater tokyo area . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a better understanding of the evolution of real estate prices such as the house price distribution might help the government to have a better control over the abnormal price fluctuations and thus to avoid economic downturns before they really happen . in this preliminary study </S>",
    "<S> , we report the distribution of house price in taiwan in 2010 . in order for taiwanese citizens to gather better information about the house price in various areas in taiwan , its government started in 2010 to regularly release the data of the price of house that are recently sold . </S>",
    "<S> the first set of released data is the price of house sold in the first quarter of 2010 in taiwan @xcite . in this set of data , there are a total of 7,374 units ( including houses , apartments , factories , etc ) sold during this period . of these seven thousand plus units , </S>",
    "<S> only 6,696 of them are for residential use so we will only include these six thousand plus units in the following analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 is the log - log plot of the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the residential house price in taiwan in the first quarter of 2010 . </S>",
    "<S> this cdf includes both the residential house price in urban as well as suburban and rural areas . </S>",
    "<S> the x - axis is the total price for the house sold and the unit here is ntd ( new taiwanese dollar , 1 usd @xmath0 32 ntd ) while the y - axis shows the number of cases sold . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the tail of the cumulative distribution function significantly differs from an exponential or lognormal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the tail can be approximated by a power law distribution with an exponent of about -2.4 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is very similar to that of the cdf obtained in @xcite .     the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the residential house price in taiwan in the first quarter of 2010 . </S>",
    "<S> the tail exhibits an approximate power law behavior with an exponent of -2.4 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 is the house price per unit area in taiwan in the same period . </S>",
    "<S> the data points in solid triangles show the distribution function for the houses sold throughout taiwan during this period . </S>",
    "<S> the x - axis is the price per unit area ( ntd per meter squared ) and the y - axis shows the number of cases sold . at first glance , </S>",
    "<S> the distribution seems somewhat strange since there is a bump on the right hand side of the peak of the distribution .     </S>",
    "<S> the house price per unit area ( ntd / m@xmath1 ) in taiwan in 2010 . </S>",
    "<S> the data points in solid triangles are for the whole taiwan area . </S>",
    "<S> the data points in squares and circles are for the greater taipei area ( gta ) and for the rest of taiwan respectively . ]    very recently , the taiwanese government has announced a new restriction on home mortgages in taiwan . for the designated greater taipei area , the same person gets much stricter restrictions on home mortgage for the second house owned under his / her name . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the house price in certain districts in the greater taipei area has almost doubled in the last two years . to have a better understanding of the distribution in figure 2 </S>",
    "<S> , we therefore divide the houses sold into two groups , the designated greater taipei area identified by the taiwanese government and the rest of taiwan . the pdf of the house price per unit area of these two groups are also included in figure 2 , with the squares for the designated greater taipei area and the circles for the rest of taiwan . </S>",
    "<S> it is surprising to find out that they both follow lognormal distributions though the positions of the peaks are different . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the two lognormal distributions can be put into a single lognormal distribution if one makes a shift of the peaks of the two distributions . </S>",
    "<S> to do so , we multiply the house price of each house sold in taiwan ( other than in the designated greater taipei area ) by the same constant ( ratio ) , in this case , about 3.3 which effectively means to translate the lognormal distribution to the right . </S>",
    "<S> one can now see that the two lognormal distributions collapse into a single lognormal ( @xmath2 , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , as shown in figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the y - axis here is normalized to represent the probability density function ( pdf ) of the distribution .     </S>",
    "<S> rescaled plot of figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the lognormal distribution of the house price / unit area for houses sold in the first quarter of the rest of taiwan area is rescaled by multiplying by a factor of 3.3 . </S>",
    "<S> the two lognormal distributions in figure 2 now collapse into a single lognormal distribution . ]    </S>",
    "<S> incidentally , the released data from the government @xcite indicate that the average income of a family in the greater taipei area in 2009 was about 1.5 times that of the rest of taiwan . </S>",
    "<S> this means that houses in the greater taipei area are indeed overpriced by a factor of about 3.3/1.5 = 2.2 ! </S>",
    "<S> a policy to correct this huge difference between the greater taipei area and the rest of taiwan by the government is therefore urgent .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 cm    summary  in this preliminary study of the house price distributions in taiwan , we found that the tail of the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the residential house price in taiwan can be approximated by a power law distribution with an exponent of about -2.4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the result obtained in a recent work [ 3 ] on the house price in the greater tokyo area . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the average house price per unit area in different regions of taiwan follow lognormal distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we have divided the houses sold into two groups  the designated greater taipei area and the rest of taiwan . </S>",
    "<S> adjusted by a ratio of 3.3 , the two lognormal distributions indeed collapse into a single lognormal distribution . from this , we conclude that the houses sold in the greater taipei area are overpriced by a factor of 2.2 . </S>",
    "<S> this will be indicated by the difference in the misery index between urban and suburban areas and will thus be a useful reference for policymakers . </S>"
