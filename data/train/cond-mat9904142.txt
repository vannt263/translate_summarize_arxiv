    "recently , a unified theory of antiferromagnetism ( af ) and superconductivity ( sc ) has been proposed for the high @xmath1 cuprates@xcite .",
    "this theory is based on the @xmath0 symmetry between af and sc , and offers a unified description of the global phase diagram for this class of materials .",
    "while the theory was originally proposed as a effective field theory description , it was soon realized that the @xmath0 symmetry could be implemented exactly at a microscopic level@xcite , and it can also be checked numerically in common strongly correlated models such as the @xmath2 model@xcite . while the phase diagram@xcite and collective excitations@xcite in the sc state derived from these @xmath0 models bear strong resemblance with the high @xmath1 cuprates , and a number of novel experimental predictions have been made@xcite , the mott insulating behavior at half - filling is a puzzling aspect which challenges the fundamental validity of the @xmath0 models@xcite . to be more precise ,",
    "the exact @xmath0 symmetry requires collective charge two excitation at half - filling to have the same mass as the collective spin wave excitations .",
    "this condition is clearly violated in a mott insulating system where all charge excitations measured with respect to a particle hole symmetric point have a large energy gap of few @xmath3 , while the spin wave excitations are massless . in the original @xmath0 proposal ,",
    "it was pointed out that this situation is analogous to a easy - axis antiferromagnet in a external uniform field , and a @xmath0 symmetry breaking term at half - filling was introduced in order to describe this asymmetric behavior between spin and charge .",
    "the chemical potential also introduces a @xmath0 symmetry breaking term , however , it was shown that these two terms could compensate each other@xcite so that the _ static potential _ governing the @xmath0 superspin could still be @xmath0 symmetric .    since the asymmetry between the charge and spin excitations at half - filling is of the order of the coulomb energy scale @xmath4 , the @xmath0 symmetry breaking terms must also be of that order .",
    "since there are various types of symmetry breaking terms , one might hope that their effects could partially cancel each other to arrive at a qualitatively correct picture .",
    "however , this type of cancellation is very delicate , and approximate calculations could easily lead to erroneous conclusions . in particular",
    ", one is interested in which physical properties could exhibit @xmath0 symmetric properties in the limit when the coulomb gap is taken to infinity .",
    "for example , one could ask the following questions :    \\1 ) one of the hallmarks of the @xmath0 symmetry is not only the degeneracy between the af and sc states at a given chemical potential , but the approximate degeneracy among all mix - states interpolating between af and sc , _ i.e. _ the independence of the ground state energy on the superspin angle . what is the potential barrier separating the af and sc states at their degeneracy point in the limit @xmath5 ? if there is a large energy barrier in this limit , one would argue that the concept of @xmath0 symmetry is not a useful one , at least not for quantitative calculations .",
    "on the other hand , if the potential barrier is finite and small in the @xmath5 limit , the concept of a approximate @xmath0 symmetry would be a useful one .",
    "\\2 ) exact @xmath0 symmetry predicts four massless collective modes . in the half - filled af state , besides the two conventional massless spin wave modes , the exact @xmath0 symmetry predicts a massless doublet of @xmath6 modes , with charge @xmath7 .",
    "however , a mott insulator has a large gap to all charge excitations .",
    "therefore , it is clear that one of the @xmath6 has to be projected out of the spectrum in the limit @xmath5 , say the @xmath8 mode carrying charge @xmath9 .",
    "what happens to the rest of the goldstone modes , the @xmath10 mode carrying charge @xmath11 and the @xmath12 triplet mode of the sc state ? in the @xmath5 limit , can they all be simultaneously massless at the transition point between af and sc ?",
    "since the pure sc state can only be reached with a finite doping concentration , is it possible that the gutzwiller projection does not affect the @xmath12 triplet mode of the sc state ?    in order to address these questions , it is desirable to construct a low energy effective theory without any parameters of the order of the coulomb scale @xmath4 . in this work",
    ", we construct a class of projected @xmath0 models which treat the gutzwiller constraint exactly and locally on every site .",
    "we use this model to answer the physical questions posed above and show that the answers are affirmative . in the @xmath5 limit , when the gutzwiller constraint is implemented exactly , the ground state energy can still be @xmath0 symmetric and independent of the superspin direction . after projecting out the @xmath8 mode , all other goldstone modes remain massless at the symmetric point .",
    "the dispersion relation of the collective modes bear unique signature of the projected @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath12 triplet modes of the pure sc states are unaffected by the gutzwiller projection .",
    "these properties define the concept of a projected @xmath0 symmetry ( @xmath13 ) , whose properties and consequences we shall explore in this paper .",
    "the fundamental quantity in the @xmath0 theory is the locally defined five component superspin vector @xmath14 describing the local af and sc order parameters respectively . in the nonlinear @xmath15 model formalism ,",
    "these are treated as mutually commuting coordinates and their dynamics is given by their conjugate momenta @xmath16 .",
    "the charge operator is the angular momentum in the @xmath17 plane : @xmath18 implementing the gutzwiller constraint corresponds to requiring @xmath19 for every local @xmath0 rotor . from equations ( [ charge ] ) and ( [ gutzwiller ] ) and subsequent discussions , we shall see that the gutzwiller projection in the @xmath0 formalism corresponds to going from a fully symmetric @xmath0 rotor model to a _ chiral _",
    "@xmath0 rotor model , where both the static potential of the individual rotors and the coupling between the rotors are still @xmath0 symmetric , but the rotors are constrained to rotate only in one sense in the @xmath17 plane , consistent with ( [ gutzwiller ] ) .",
    "this observation reveals a deep connection between the gutzwiller projection and the lowest - landau - level ( lll ) projection in the fractional quantum hall effect@xcite . to be more precise , the gutzwiller projection represented by equations ( [ charge ] ) and ( [ gutzwiller ] ) is analogous to the lll projection , where all states in the lll have a definite sign of angular momentum . the lll projection can be analytically implemented by separating the cyclotron degrees of freedom from the guiding center degrees of freedom , which amounts to changing the commuting property between the @xmath20 and @xmath21 coordinates to a canonically conjugate commutation relation : @xmath22 = i \\l_0   \\label{guiding - center}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the landau length . exploiting this analogy , we find that the original @xmath0 model can be fully gutzwiller projected without changing its form , if one imposes the simple quantization condition between the superconducting components of the superspin vector : @xmath24 = i/2    \\label{non - commute}\\ ] ] in the symmetric @xmath0 model , the wave function of the @xmath0 rotors are functions of the local coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while the projected @xmath0 model only depends on their holomorphic combination @xmath27 and is independent of their anti - holomorphic combination @xmath28",
    "this way , we arrive at a natural projection of the @xmath0 model where the local gutzwiller constraint is taken into account exactly , and the resulting model is free of the large coulomb @xmath4 parameter . because the functional form of the symmetric @xmath0 model remain the same and only the quantization condition is modified upon projection , many important properties associated with the @xmath0 symmetry remain .",
    "the central hypothesis of the @xmath0 theory is that this projected model is quantitatively accurate in describing both the static and dynamic properties of the high @xmath1 cuprates , and we shall compare the properties of this model with the phenomenology of the high @xmath1 systems .",
    "we begin with the symmetric @xmath0 hamiltonian defined on a lattice , @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the five component superspin vector on a given site , and @xmath31 is the @xmath0 symmetry generator , @xmath32 expressed here in terms of the superspin vector @xmath33 and its canonically conjugate momenta @xmath34 , @xmath35 = i \\delta_{ab}\\ ] ] this lattice quantum non - linear @xmath15 model can be rigorously derived as the low energy limit of a microscopic @xmath0 ladder model@xcite . on the ladder ,",
    "the rung @xmath0 singlet state is the vacuum @xmath36 , from which the lowest so(5 ) multiplet @xmath37 is created by a quintet of bose creation operators , which satisfy      here , @xmath39 denote the triplet ( magnon ) states , and @xmath40 are the hole and particle pair states .",
    "( see fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) ) .",
    "the superspin coordinates are microscopically constructed using these lattice bosons , @xmath41    = 4.0 cm    due to their microscopic origin , these bosonic states are hard - core bosons , in the sense that one can not define two of them on the same rung .",
    "the @xmath42 term in equation ( [ sigma ] ) describes the gap energy of the magnon and the pair states , the @xmath43 term stands for the hopping and the spontaneous creation / destruction process of these states , and the @xmath44 term describes their nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "this quantum nonlinear @xmath15 model can in principle also be derived in higher dimensions from a microscopic @xmath0 symmetric model@xcite , by introducing a superspin vector as a hubbard - stratonovich decoupling field , and integrate out the fermionic degrees of freedom in a gradient expansion .",
    "however , we shall proceed more heuristically here@xcite . for a two dimensional system",
    ", one can imagine that the quantum @xmath15 model hamiltonian is obtained from a ",
    "block spin \" type of coarse - graining of the microscopic electron hamiltonian , and is defined on a lattice with twice the lattice constant compared to the microscopic electron model .",
    "( this doubled unit cell is the minimal size needed to define the local af and d wave sc order parameters ) .",
    "therefore , each site @xmath45 in the effective model correspond to a plaquette of the microscopic electron model .",
    "( on a ladder , this corresponds to going from the lattice sites to ladder rungs ) .",
    "the @xmath0 singlet state @xmath36 corresponds to a  rvb \" type of singlet state , while the five - fold states @xmath46 describe the triplet magnon states , and the @xmath47-wave hole and particle pair states on a plaquette . unlike the ladder case",
    ", the magnon and the @xmath47- wave pair states could condense in the ground state to form af and sc broken symmetry states .",
    "in fact , eder@xcite has recently shown that properties of the af states can be described by a coherent state of magnon condensation on top of a uniform spin liquid state .",
    "our model therefore describes competition among the  rvb \" type of singlet vacuum and the two forms of broken symmetry order .",
    "while it is reasonable to take @xmath43 and @xmath44 to be approximately equal for magnons and pairs , the gap energy @xmath42 for the neutral magnons and the charged pairs are very different in the insulating state at half - filling .",
    "in fact , their difference is of the order of the insulating gap @xmath4 at half - filling . taking into account the hard - core condition and neglecting the nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath44 for now ( it has higher powers of time and space derivatives in the continuum limit ) , we can express the general anisotropic @xmath0 model as @xmath48 in this paper we shall use the convention where @xmath49 denote the superspin indices , @xmath50 denote the spin indices and @xmath51 denote the charge indices , and repeated indices are summed over .",
    "the main focus of our paper is to consider the limit where @xmath52 .",
    "let us define the charge eigen - operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 as @xmath55 from this definition , it is clear that @xmath56 is the creation operator for a hole pair and @xmath57 is the creation operator for a particle pair .",
    "we can introduce a chemical potential term @xmath58 to describe the effects of doping . in the presence of this chemical potential term ,",
    "the gap energy of the hole and particle pairs are @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "a chemical potential of the order of the charge gap @xmath61 is needed to induce a metal - insulator transition in this system .",
    "near such a transition point , the gap energy of the hole pair @xmath62 can be comparable to the spin gap @xmath63 , while the gap towards a particle pair excitation is of the order of twice the charge gap , and needs to be projected out of the spectrum in the low energy limit .",
    "therefore , within this formalism , the gutzwiller projection is equivalent to restricting ourselves to the projected hilbert space where @xmath64 at every site @xmath45 . within this projected hilbert space",
    ", the projected hamiltonian takes the form @xmath65 this hamiltonian has no parameters of the order of @xmath4 , and it is reasonable to expect @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we see that the form of the hamiltonian hardly changes from the unprojected model , but the definition of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is changed from @xmath68 to @xmath69 from equation ( [ before ] ) , we see that @xmath25 and @xmath26 commute with each other before the projection .",
    "however , after the projection , they acquire a nontrivial commutation relation , as can be seen from equation ( [ after ] ) : @xmath24 = i/2\\ ] ] therefore , the gutzwiller projection can be analytically implemented in the @xmath0 theory by retaining the form of the hamiltonian and change only the quantization condition .",
    "the discussions outlined above reveal a deep connection between the gutzwiller projection within the @xmath0 formalism and the projection onto the lowest landau level ( lll ) in the context of the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "consider the problem of a charged particle in a strong magnetic field @xmath70 and a rotationally symmetric potential @xmath71 . in the absence of a magnetic field , all eigenstates form irreducible representations of the two dimensional rotation group @xmath72 , characterized by integral eigenvalues of the angular momentum operator @xmath73 however , in the presence of a strong magnetic field and projected into the lll , only negative eigenvalues of @xmath74 are realized .",
    "this is analogous to the situation encountered here .",
    "the local charge operator in the @xmath0 theory takes the form of the angular momentum in the @xmath17 plane as given by equation ( [ charge ] ) .",
    "when doubly occupied sites are locally projected out , the local charge operator , or the angular momentum in the @xmath17 plane , takes only negative values . since the chemical potential couples directly the angular momentum in the @xmath17 plane , it plays the role of a fictitious magnetic field threading every @xmath0 rotor in the @xmath17 plane .",
    "the landau level spacing @xmath75 is analogous to the charge gap @xmath61 encountered here , and both are taken to be infinity in the projected models . after the projection ,",
    "the hamiltonian in the landau level problem retains its @xmath72 symmetric form , @xmath76 although a new quantization condition is imposed between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , as given by equation ( [ guiding - center ] ) .",
    "this is analogous to the observation we made here that the hamiltonian formally retains a @xmath0 symmetric form after the projection ( [ constraint1 ] ) , but the quantum dynamics is changed due to the non - trivial commutator between @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in both cases only a part of the full symmetry multiplets remain after the projection .",
    "however , the formal symmetry of the hamiltonian has direct physical manifestations despite the projection .",
    "for example , in the lll problems , semi - classical orbits of the guiding center coordinates are still @xmath72 symmetric . in our case",
    ", we shall see that the static potential for the superspin vector can still be @xmath0 invariant despite the projection .    perhaps the most explicit way to establish the precise connections between these two problems is to consider the constraints on the wave function . in the symmetric gauge of the lll problem , the annihilation operator for the cyclotron coordinates",
    "takes the form@xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "projection onto lll requires @xmath80 which determines the form of the lll wave function to be @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a holomorphic function of @xmath83 only .",
    "this holomorphic condition also places strong constraints in many - body systems and led to the celebrated laughlin s wave function .",
    "our no - double - occupancy constraint ( [ constraint1 ] ) is analogous to the lll constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) .",
    "in fact from equations ( [ p - h ] ) and ( [ before ] ) , we obtain @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 . for a single unprojected @xmath0 rotor ,",
    "the wave function @xmath87 is a function of the superspin coordinates .",
    "however , the gutzwiller projection ( [ constraint1 ] ) restricts the wave function to be @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a holomorphic function of @xmath83 . for a collection of @xmath0 rotors ,",
    "the superspin coordinates are themselves functions of the lattice sites @xmath45 , and @xmath90 $ ] is a functional is the superspin coordinates at each site . for the projected @xmath0 models , this functional",
    "is restricted to take the form @xmath91 = f(z(x),n_\\alpha(x ) ) \\prod_{x } e^{-z\\bar z(x)/2 } \\label{functional}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is a holomorphic functional of @xmath93 .",
    "the formal but precise analogy between the two types of projection allows us to introduce the concept of a chiral @xmath0 rotor .",
    "this is a system of rotors with @xmath0 invariant potential and coupling , however , the rotation within the @xmath17 plane is chiral , _",
    "i.e. _ only one sense of the rotation is allowed .",
    "such a system of chiral @xmath0 rotors is described by the wave functional in equation ( [ functional ] ) .",
    "having discussed the general notions of the projected @xmath0 model , we are now in a position to explore the phase diagram of this model . as we commented earlier , the projected @xmath0 model describes the competition and unification of the spin liquid , af and the sc states . in the original unprojected @xmath0 symmetric model ,",
    "not only are the af and sc states degenerate in energy , but they are also degenerate with all the intermediate coexistence states .",
    "this points out a route from af to sc with no potential barrier , and introduces the concept that the metal - insulator transition in the high @xmath1 systems can be viewed as a smooth rotation of the @xmath0 superspin .",
    "one of the key questions to be answered in this work is what happens to the picture in the case of projected @xmath0 symmetry .    in anticipation of the competition of the states discussed above",
    ", we construct a class of variational wave functions in the coherent state representation : @xmath94 here @xmath95 denotes a local singlet state defined by @xmath96 and @xmath36 is a product state of these local singlets , @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 is a local variational parameter describing the competition between long range order and quantum disorder . for @xmath99 our variational wave function describe a spin singlet ground state , while a non - zero value of @xmath100 describes a coherent state formed by the local singlet , the magnon or the hole pair state",
    "this wave function is a generalization of the coherent state description of a af state in terms of a magnon condensate@xcite . as we shall see from the following equation ( [ superspin_vector ] ) , @xmath101 stands for the length of the @xmath0 superspin vector . @xmath102 and @xmath103 are general complex variational parameters describing the local amplitude for magnons and hole pairs .",
    "we notice that this wave function satisfies both the gutzwiller constraint ( [ constraint1 ] ) and the hard - core constraint for magnons and hole pairs exactly . it is easy to see that @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex number .",
    "the coupling terms in the projected @xmath0 hamiltonian depend only on @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the coupling energy depends only on the real part of @xmath102 while it depends on both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , for discussing the ground state wave functions , we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath102 is real and @xmath110 .",
    "the normalization condition @xmath111 can be implemented by the constraint that @xmath112 therefore , we see that although we have completely projected out the particle pair states , the local degrees of freedom can still be represented by a vector on a five dimensional sphere .",
    "uniform states are obtained by taking all parameters to be constant . for @xmath113 and @xmath114 ,",
    "our wave function @xmath115 describes a pure af state with the following properties : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "equation ( [ af - state ] ) describes a half - filled state with a macroscopic neel magnetization , and vanishing uniform magnetization .",
    "furthermore , this state is composed as a linear superposition of eigenstates with different values of the total spin , and the fluctuation of the total spin scales like @xmath118 , just as one expects from a standard neel state .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath119 and @xmath114 , @xmath115 describes a pure sc state with the following properties : @xmath120 equation ( [ sc - state ] ) describes a state with a finite doping density and a finite sc order parameter .",
    "just as in the standard bcs case , this state is composed as a linear superposition of eigenstates with different values of the total charge , and the fluctuation of the total charge scales like @xmath121 , just as one expects from a standard sc state .",
    "however , besides these two _ pure _ states , there is a class of _ mixed _ states which interpolates between the pure af and sc states .",
    "taking @xmath122 and @xmath123 , we see that the mixed states have the following property : @xmath124 therefore , we see that there is a continuous family of intermediate mixed states interpolating between the pure af state at half - filling and the pure sc state with finite doping density . as the @xmath0 angle",
    "@xmath125 rotates continuously from a pure af state with @xmath126 to a pure sc state with @xmath127 , the hole density of the mixed state interpolates continuously between these two limits .",
    "therefore , our wave function gives a unified description of af and sc and points out a precise route from af to sc as the doping level is varied . in order for this route , or small deviations from this route ,",
    "to be physically realized in the high @xmath1 superconductors , we have to demonstrate that there is no large energy barrier for the intermediate mixed states , or that the ground state energy is approximately independent of the @xmath0 mixing angle @xmath125 .",
    "in particular , we have to show that the energy barrier is independent of the hubbard energy @xmath4 , in the limit of large @xmath4 . in the following",
    ", we shall investigate this question .",
    "the energy functional @xmath128 describes the coupling between these five dimensional vectors @xmath102 , and it is given by @xmath129 this ground state energy functional describes a systems of coupled rotors satisfying the constraint ( [ normalization ] ) .",
    "at the point @xmath130 and @xmath131 in parameter space , this rotor model is exactly @xmath0 symmetric .",
    "this is a central observation of this work .    from this consideration",
    "we learn a very important lesson about the compatibility of the mott insulating gap and the idea of a smooth @xmath0 rotation from af to sc . as we have seen , the large asymmetry between the charge and spin gap at half - filling necessitates the removal of the @xmath132 part of the @xmath0 multiplets , therefore , the dynamics close to half - filling has to be modified .",
    "but the static potential governing the transition from af to sc can remain @xmath0 symmetric , and in particular , the energy barrier separating these two states can remain small in the limit where the mott insulating gap tends to infinity .",
    "we also observe a crucial difference between the projected and the unprojected @xmath0 models . in the unprojected @xmath0 model with the full @xmath0 symmetry , af and sc states are degenerate at half - filling , and the rotation between these two states",
    "can be continuously performed without changing the density to going away from half - filling .",
    "this case is similar to the well - known degeneracy between the cdw state and the @xmath133 wave sc state for the negative @xmath4 hubbard model at half - filling . in the projected @xmath0 model , where all particle pair states have been locally removed ,",
    "the @xmath0 rotation from the af to sc states are accompanied by the continuous change of the hole density , and a pure sc state can only be reached at a finite critical hole doping density @xmath134 .",
    "while the unprojected @xmath0 symmetry is only valid at half - filling , the projected @xmath0 symmetry can be valid for a range of doping concentration @xmath135 , since all these doping concentrations correspond to the same value of the chemical potential @xmath136 at which the ground state energy ( [ energy ] ) is @xmath0 symmetric .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the projected @xmath0 symmetry at @xmath136 has only been demonstrated within the variational mean field approximation .",
    "this corresponds to the semiclassical limit , and becomes exact only in the large @xmath133 limit , where @xmath133 labels the representation of the local @xmath0 group at a given site .",
    "quantum fluctuations can be systematically investigated as a @xmath137 expansion .",
    "assuming uniform ground states , we have studied the effect of zero point fluctuations in sec .",
    "[ fluctuations ] and found that at @xmath136 , the intermediate mixed states have slightly higher energy than the af and sc state .",
    "therefore , quantum fluctuation leads to a slight breaking of the projected @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the important point here is that this symmetry breaking effect can be systematically controlled in the semi - classical @xmath137 expansion , and certainly is independent of the coulomb energy scale @xmath4 .",
    "this fluctuation would induce a first order transition and predict phase separation of af and sc states at @xmath136 .",
    "however , there are also other competing interactions such as nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor interactions which tend to reduce the barrier , and could also lead to non - uniform states like stripes . due to the complexity of the calculations",
    ", we shall defer the detailed studies of these competing effects to future works .",

    "within such a framework , the 3d af ( @xmath181 ) and sc ( @xmath1 ) transition temperatures are proportional to the stiffness of the spin and the phase fluctuations , which are in turn proportional to @xmath182 and @xmath183 respectively . therefore , fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) gives an approximate estimate of the transition temperatures .",
    "for small @xmath184 , we see that there is a sharp drop of @xmath181 and a maximum of @xmath1 at @xmath185 .",
    "the system is a af insulator at doping @xmath186 and a pure sc state for @xmath173 .",
    "the reason for a maximum of @xmath1 at @xmath185 is due to the strong correlation of the charged bosons .",
    "the charge bosons have a hard - core interaction , therefore , they are insulating at both @xmath186 and @xmath187 and have maximal charge stiffness at @xmath185 .",
    "we can perform a rough translation of this optimal doping value in our effective model to the microscopic model . since",
    "our effective model is defined on a unit cell with twice the lattice spacing of the microscopic model , @xmath185 therefore describes one hole pair per four sites in the microscopic model , or a doping of @xmath188 in the conventional language .",
    "this crude argument tends to overestimate the value for optimal doping , since it neglects the effects of unpaired electrons .",
    "however , considering the crudeness of the estimate , it is still reasonably close to the optimal doping @xmath189 observed in the lsco family of high @xmath1 superconductors .    in the regime of @xmath135 ,",
    "the system is a coherent mixture of af and sc order . for this entire range of densities , the system has a projected @xmath0 symmetry within the variational approximation discussed above .",
    "the projected @xmath0 symmetry manifests itself in terms of a infinite compressibility in the region @xmath135 and , as we shall see in next section , a charge mode with a dispersion relation @xmath190 .",
    "since such a state is rather unusual , and maybe highly susceptible to density fluctuations , we would like to discuss more detailed physical properties in this region .    first let us comment on the fact that there are familiar physical systems whose uniform ground states are infinitely compressible .",
    "the free boson model is certainly such an example , and the density mode also has a @xmath190 dispersion relation .",
    "but the infinite compressibility is due to the absence of the interaction , which is not characteristic of the strongly interaction system considered here .",
    "a less trivial example is the spin @xmath191 xxz ferromagnetic heisenberg model , given by the hamiltonian , @xmath192 where @xmath193 and the sum extends over nearest neighbor sites of a square lattice .",
    "this model can be interpreted as quantum hard - core boson model , where the fully polarized spin down state could be identified with the vacuum of the bosons , the xy part of the hamiltonian describes the hopping of the bosons and the last term describes the nearest neighbor attraction between the bosons if @xmath194 .",
    "when @xmath195 , the system is in the ising limit , and the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath196 symmetry implies phase separation of the bosons . on the other hand , when @xmath197 , the system is in the xy limit , and the ground state is a superfluid .",
    "therefore , the anisotropy parameter describe the competition between superfluidity and phase separation . at @xmath198 ,",
    "the system has a @xmath199 symmetry and the dispersion relation becomes quadratic .",
    "different directions of the ferromagnetic polarizations are degenerate and can be changed without any energy cost .",
    "since the @xmath83 component of the ferromagnetic polarization is identified with the total density of the hard - core bosons , the @xmath199 vacuum degeneracy implies infinite compressibility of the corresponding boson system for the entire range of boson densities @xmath177 .",
    "these two examples illustrates that there is nothing intrinsically pathological about having a system with infinite compressibility .",
    "the second example is more generic , and shows that uniform states with infinite compressibility can be obtained in systems on the verge of phase separation , and the infinite compressibility can be ensured by symmetry .",
    "both of these properties are also shared by the projected @xmath0 model .",
    "these models are on the verge of phase separation into af and sc phases , and the infinite compressibility is a result of the projected @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "it indicates that small perturbations , such as next nearest neighbor interactions , quantum fluctuations , and quenched disorder will be very important to determine the true ground state . with such perturbations ,",
    "the ground state is expected to be unstable toward the experimentally reported textures such as the spin glass , stripes and incommensurate spin density waves .",
    "next let us investigate the phenomenological consequence of this remarkable property .",
    "one of the most puzzling properties of the high @xmath1 superconductors is the constant chemical potential in the underdoped samples .",
    "for lsco systems , where the doping level can be varied continuously by the @xmath200 concentration , this effect has been dramatically observed in the arpes experiments and the constant chemical potential persists from the weakly doped insulator to optimally doped superconductor@xcite .",
    "in fact numerical calculations on the hubbard model also reveal similar divergent behavior of the compressibility as the metal - insulator transition is approached from the metallic side@xcite .",
    "the simplest explanation of the small chemical potential shift is a two phase mixture with different densities at a first order phase transition .",
    "if the system globally phase separates into two different spatial regions with different charge densities but the same free energy densities , the added charges only change the proportion of mixture of the two phases and do not change the energy , therefore , @xmath201 .",
    "however , this situation of global phase separation can certainly not occur in a system with long ranged coulomb interaction and is ruled out in the real high @xmath1 system .",
    "a phenomenon possibly related to the tendency of phase separation is the formation of stripes@xcite .",
    "a stripe state can be viewed as microscopic phase separation of af and sc into alternating regions , where each region has different charge density and the same free energy density .",
    "however , a crucial difference between the global phase separation and this picture of microscopic phase separation is that the stripe state has infinitely many surfaces between af and sc , and the surface energy makes a finite contribution to the total energy in the thermodynamic limit . in this picture",
    ", doping can be accomplished by converting af stripes into sc stripes , thereby creating more surfaces separating af and sc regions .",
    "finite doping density therefore leads to a finite density of surfaces and the accumulated surface energy would in general lead to a shift of the chemical potential _ under a generic situation_. additional physical conditions are needed to ensure the constant chemical potential in the stripe phase .",
    "therefore , the absence of the chemical potential shift places a very strong constraint on possible theoretical explanations . the projected @xmath0 model proposed in this work offers a possible explanation for the absence of chemical potential shift . at a critical value of the chemical potential where",
    "the af and sc states have degenerate energy density , we can have three situations , where the intermediate mixed states have higher , lower or degenerate energy compared to the af and sc states .",
    "when the intermediate states have higher energy , the system will go through a first order phase transition at @xmath136 and this will lead to global phase separation into af and sc regions . on the other hand , if the intermediate states have lower energy , there exists a range of chemical potential @xmath202 where the mixed phase has a uniform and continuously varying density . in this case , @xmath203 is obtained .",
    "when the region @xmath202 shrinks to zero , we obtain the limiting @xmath0 symmetric case where the system is on the boundary between a first order transition and two second order phase transitions . in this case , @xmath201 for a range of densities @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , if we restrict to ground states where the density is not globally inhomogeneous , the absence of the chemical shift directly implies @xmath0 symmetry .    within this model , we can therefore define a experimental procedure to measure one of the most crucial parameter of the theory , namely @xmath184 . using the experimental arpes data for lsco system we would identify @xmath184 to be approximately the same as the optimal doping density .",
    "we recall that @xmath184 is also a measure of the degree of the quantum spin fluctuation in the system . for the bi - layer materials such as ybco and bisco superconductors , the quantum spin fluctuation are stronger due to the inter - layer spin exchange , and we would predict that @xmath184 should be less than the optimal doping value .",
    "having discussed the ground state properties and the phase diagram of the model , we are now in a position to study the collective excitations of the model . we have argued that the ground state energy can remain @xmath0 symmetric despite the projection .",
    "however , the projection does affect the collective excitation spectrum near half - filling .",
    "nonetheless , as we shall see , there remains a unique signature of the projected @xmath0 symmetry in the collective excitation spectra .    in principle",
    ", the collective excitation spectra can be obtained straightforwardly by studying the quadratic fluctuations around the mean field minima .",
    "the resulting quadratic boson hamiltonian can be simply diagonalized .",
    "the main complication in the procedure is the hard - core boson constraint , which requires @xmath204 for every site .",
    "there are several ways to implement this constraint rigorously .",
    "one is to follow the mapping from the one - component hard - core boson model to the @xmath205 model and generalize it to a multi - component hard - core boson model .",
    "one could also convert the above inequality constraint to an equality constraint by introducing a boson creation and annihilation operator for the singlet state .",
    "this approach will be implemented in the appendix . for simplicity of presentation , here we shall adopt a less rigorous approach and introduce a on - site boson repulsion term @xmath206 to our hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and convert the hard - core constraint to a soft - core constraint .",
    "we shall show later that all results can be expressed in terms of the order parameter , which is implicitly dependent on @xmath207 , but there is no explicit dependence on @xmath207 .",
    "we have verified that all three methods give the same long wave length spectra for the collective modes in the limit of low boson density . in the next section",
    ", we shall present another calculation based on the continuum effective lagrangian method , which also reproduces the same spectra .    to simplify presentation",
    ", we shall concentrate on the case where the ground state energy functional ( [ energy ] ) is @xmath0 symmetric , _",
    "i.e. _ for coupling constants @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "we choose the direction of spontaneously broken symmetry to be @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "the extremal condition can be easily determined to be @xmath212 the combination @xmath213 expresses the fact that the classical minimum is @xmath0 symmetric .",
    "we can therefore write @xmath214 and @xmath215 . expanding the boson operators as : @xmath216 we obtain the following quadratic hamiltonian @xmath217 we are in particular interested in the collective mode spectra for the af insulating state with @xmath126 , the mixed states with @xmath163 and the sc state with @xmath127 and how they connect to each other .    from this quadratic hamiltonian we can learn a number of important features .",
    "first we notice that the @xmath218 and @xmath219 modes are decoupled for all ranges of @xmath220 , but most importantly , their dispersion relations are independent of @xmath125 and given by @xmath221 where @xmath222 and @xmath223 is the lattice constant .",
    "this is indeed a very remarkable property . at @xmath126 , @xmath218 and @xmath219",
    "modes are nothing but the transverse af spin wave modes .",
    "af spin waves are usually viewed as goldstone modes and their existence is due to the af long range order .",
    "however , as @xmath125 changes continuously from @xmath168 to @xmath169 , the af long range order continuously diminishes until it vanishes at @xmath127 .",
    "the reason that the properties of the @xmath218 and @xmath219 modes do not change at all is due to the @xmath0 symmetry of this model , since the diminishing af order is compensated by the increasing sc order as the superspin angle @xmath125 is varied",
    ". as we shall see , the @xmath224 mode is the af spin amplitude mode at @xmath126 , but it becomes massless and degenerate with the @xmath218 and @xmath219 modes at @xmath127 .",
    "these three modes form a massless @xmath225 triplet mode whose existence is purely a consequence of the sc order . therefore , as @xmath125 is continuously varied from @xmath168 to @xmath169",
    ", the transverse af spin wave modes gradually change their character to become the @xmath225 triplet resonance of the sc state .",
    "as we shall see , for @xmath172 , the @xmath225 triplet mode becomes massive .    at the af point",
    "@xmath126 , the spin amplitude mode @xmath224 is decoupled from the sc mode @xmath226 and can be diagonalized separately .",
    "the dispersion for the spin amplitude mode has the conventional massive relativistic form for small @xmath227 @xmath228 on the other hand , we have a massless sc goldstone mode @xmath226 with the following dispersion , @xmath229 this mode is an important new prediction of the @xmath0 theory .",
    "it is the counterpart of the @xmath225 resonance in the af state . in the unprojected @xmath0 model ,",
    "there are two such modes , with charge @xmath7 , and they represent gapless fluctuations from af to sc at half - filling . in the projected @xmath0 model , the charge @xmath9 mode is projected out of the spectrum , however , the charge @xmath11 mode remain massless at @xmath136 .",
    "it is also a manifestation of the gapless fluctuation from af to sc at half - filling , but the sc fluctuation is hole - like , rather than both hole and particle - like as in the unprojected case .",
    "we see again that a large mott - hubbard gap is fully compatible with gapless sc fluctuation at half - filling .",
    "experimental detection of this mode could provide a important test of the projected @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath224 and the @xmath226 modes also decouple in the pure sc state with @xmath127 .",
    "however , their physical interpretation change .",
    "the @xmath224 mode becomes gapless at this point with the same dispersion as in ( [ spin_wave ] ) .",
    "therefore , the three modes @xmath224 , @xmath218 and @xmath219 form a gapless @xmath225 triplet mode of the pure sc state , and represent the gapless fluctuation from sc to af at @xmath136 , but with a finite hole density @xmath184 given in ( [ rho_c ] ) .",
    "the dispersion for the @xmath226 mode is given by @xmath230 and has the natural interpretation of a linearly dispersing phase goldstone mode of the sc state .",
    "in the intermediate mixed state with @xmath163 , the @xmath224 and the the @xmath226 modes are coupled .",
    "diagonalization of these modes gives : @xmath231 the upper massive mode has predominantly spin amplitude character , and we see that the gap diminishes continuously until it reaches zero at @xmath127 to become the massless @xmath225 triplet mode .",
    "the lower mode has predominantly sc fluctuation character , and has a gapless @xmath232 dispersion . in the mixed region where both the af and the sc order parameters are non - zero",
    ", one would naturally expect a gapless phase mode corresponding to the sc order .",
    "however , in a interacting boson system , the phase mode is expected to have linear dispersion on general ground .",
    "therefore , what is surpassing and new here is not the gapless nature of the sc mode , but its _",
    "quadratic dispersion_. in order to locate the origin of the quadratic dispersion , we have perturbed the model away from the projected @xmath0 symmetric point so that a uniform mixed state is stabilized as a classical minimum .",
    "sc fluctuation around such a non-@xmath0 symmetric point is gapless and has linear dispersion .",
    "a quadratic dispersion is only realized at the @xmath0 symmetric point .",
    "therefore , the quadratic dispersion is a unique signature of the projected @xmath0 symmetry in the entire range of densities @xmath135 ! to understand the physical origin of this remarkable phenomenon , we notice that a boson system with gapless quadratic dispersion generally has infinite compressibility .",
    "this can be directly seen from the compressibility sum rule @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the dynamical density correlation function .",
    "because of the quadratic dispersion relation , we can see explicitly that @xmath235 for small @xmath227 , therefore , a infinite compressibility is obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "a infinite compressibility implies that @xmath236 , _",
    "i.e. _ the chemical potential is independent of doping .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath291 .",

    "we also observe that near the af / sc transition point where @xmath293 , the first order time derivative term is of the order of one .",
    "furthermore , in the spirit of the low frequency and wave vector expansion , we only need to retain the first order time derivative term in the charge sector and can drop the second term in the above lagrangian . combining all these considerations , we obtain the following low energy effective lagrangian near the af / sc transition region , which is free of any parameters of the order of @xmath4 : @xmath294 this is exactly the lagrangian counterpart of the @xmath0 projection procedure discussed previously in the hamiltonian language . dropping the second order time derivative terms",

    "the system has a pure sc ground state , the sc order parameter rises to a maximal value before it decreases with doping . at the projected @xmath0 symmetric point",
    ", we can understand precisely the evolution of the collective modes . on the af side",
    ", we have two gapless spin wave modes and a gapless charge mode describing the gapless fluctuation from af to sc . in the intermediate density regime @xmath135 ,",
    "the physical properties of the spin waves remain unchanged , while the massive spin amplitude mode gradually decreases its energy and merges with the two spin wave modes at @xmath315 .",
    "the charge mode in the intermediate density regime is gapless , but has quadratic dispersion relation , which is a unique signature of the projected @xmath0 symmetry . for @xmath173 ,",
    "the charge mode is gapless with linear dispersion relation , and the @xmath225 triplet spin mode becomes massive , and gradually increases its energy with increasing doping .",
    "in this regime , the behavior of the collective modes are identical to the unprojected @xmath0 model .",
    "this very simple model can form the basis to understand many novel and puzzling properties of the high @xmath1 superconductors in a unified framework .",
    "it points out a route from af to sc through a gradual rotation of the superspin angle . at the projected @xmath0",
    "symmetry point the mean field energy is independent of the superspin angle , and therefore it offers an explanation of the absence of the chemical potential shift in the underdoped regime without global phase separation .",
    "it predicts a phase diagram which is qualitatively consistent with the observed phase diagram in the high @xmath1 materials . in the underdoped regime of the phase diagram ,",
    "the system have large af and sc fluctuations , and these fluctuations can be responsible for the pseudogap physics observed in these materials .",
    "there are many possible directions to carry out this line of research in the future .",
    "the most important issue is to understand the precise nature of the intermediate state in the regime @xmath135 .",
    "since the system has infinite compressibility in this regime , different small perturbation may select different ground states .",
    "such perturbing effects might include quantum fluctuations and longer ranged interactions .",
    "in particular , we would like to investigate the possibility that these perturbations might lead to the formation of incommensurate order or stripes .",
    "in this work , we have discussed extensively the collective fluctuations in the long wave length limit . due to the definitions of our effective lattice model",
    ", the @xmath316 limit corresponds to the @xmath316 limit in the sc correlation functions and the @xmath317 limit of the af spin correlation functions . within the @xmath0 theory ,",
    "the @xmath225 resonance in the sc state is viewed as the @xmath0 symmetry partner of the @xmath316 goldstone mode of the sc phase fluctuation .",
    "while the commensurate neutron resonance mode is observed in both ybco and bisco superconductors , all high @xmath1 systems also have incommensurate spin fluctuations .",
    "how can these features be explained within the current theoretical model ?",
    "the fact that lsco and ybco have very different fermi surface shapes and yet have similar incommensurate magnetic peaks strongly suggests that the incommensurate peaks are not sensitive to fermi surface effects and should be explainable within an effective bosonic model .",
    "let us recall that the collective mode of a superfluid boson system consists of linearly dispersing phonon branch and another roton branch with a minimum located at the inverse inter - particle spacing .",
    "so far , we have only studied the phonon branch of the charged bosons .",
    "by analogy , the roton branch should also exist , with a wave vector determined by the density of the charged bosons or doping . within the @xmath0 theory , while the commensurate neutron resonance can be viewed as the @xmath0 partner of the sc phase mode , the incommensurate magnetic peaks can be viewed as the @xmath0 partner of the roton minimum of the charged bosons .",
    "a detailed quantitative analysis of this picture will be carried out in the future .",
    "however , while the ground state in the doping range @xmath135 may depend sensitively on small perturbation effects , at finite temperature , these perturbation effects should be small and the system should display more universal properties .",
    "we have shown that the projected @xmath0 symmetry should be valid for the entire doping range @xmath135 , and we shall quantitatively study the manifestation of this symmetry at finite temperature , and see if the projected @xmath0 symmetry can give a universal explanation of the pseudogap physics .    _",

    "is replaced with the equality constraint @xmath319 with @xmath320 . since in physical states",
    "one always has one and only one boson per lattice sites , destruction ( creation ) of a boson @xmath321 ( @xmath322 ) must always be accompanied by creation ( destruction ) of the empty boson @xmath323 ( @xmath324 ) . in this way",
