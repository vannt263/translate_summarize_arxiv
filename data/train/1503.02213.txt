    "the human brain contains about @xmath0 neurons @xcite , and each neuron is connected to approximately @xmath1 other neurons @xcite .",
    "these connections called synapses , are arranged in a highly complex network .",
    "they are responsible for neuronal communication and can be classified into two categories : electrical and chemical synapses @xcite . in electrical synapses the transmission of information from one neuron to another is directly performed from the pre - synaptic cell to the post - synaptic cell via gap junctions . in chemical synapses ,",
    "the process occurs via neurotransmitters , which cross the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the membrane of the synaptic cell @xcite .",
    "neurotransmitters may increase or decrease the probability of an action potential of a post - synaptic neuron , and the synapses are called excitatory or inhibitory , respectively @xcite . furthermore , the intensity of the chemical synapses can be modified , in other words , they can be minimised or potentiated @xcite .",
    "the mechanism responsible for these adjustments is known as synaptic plasticity @xcite .",
    "the synaptic plasticity , that is , the ability of synapses to weaken or strenthen over time @xcite is an important property of the mammalian brain .",
    "in addition , the synaptic plasticity is also related to processes of learning and memory @xcite .",
    "this adjustment of the intensities of the chemical synapses can be correlated with phenomena of synchronisation of the neuronal firing @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of synchronisation in some specific areas of the brain may be associated with some diseases , such as the epilepsy and the parkinson s disease @xcite . on the other hand , it is also responsible for some vital brain functions , such as processing of sensory information and motor function @xcite .",
    "methods to suppress synchronisation have been proposed in neuroscience , as the introduction of external perturbations @xcite .",
    "tass and collaborators have verified the possibility of desynchronisation in hippocampal neuronal populations through coordinated reset stimulation @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , popovych and collaborators have found that the introduction of a perturbation in a globally connected neuronal network combined with synaptic plasticity can provide a positive contribution to the firing synchronisation @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study firing synchronisation in a random hodgkin - huxley neuronal network with plasticity according to spike timing - dependent plasticity ( stdp ) .",
    "this synaptic plasticity model adjusts the connection strengths by means of the temporal interval between pre - synaptic and post - synaptic spikes @xcite .",
    "bi and poo have reported that the change in synaptic efficiency after several repetitions of the experiment is due to the time difference of firing @xcite .",
    "if one pre - synaptic spike precedes a post - synaptic spike , a long - term potentiation occurs , otherwise , a long - term depression appears @xcite .",
    "a computational neuronal network specifies the connection architecture among neurons . a globally coupled hodgkin - huxley neuron model was also considered by popovych and collaborators @xcite .",
    "they studied the synchronisation behaviour considering stdp , and found that the mean synaptic coupling presents a dependence on the input level . in this work",
    ", we consider a random neuronal network with stdp , and input , where the connections are associated with chemical synapses @xcite .",
    "one main result is to show that spike synchonisation in a neuronal network , depending on the probability of connections , can be improved due to spike timing - dependent plasticity .",
    "this improvement is also observed when an external perturbation is applied on the network .",
    "another important result is that the orientation of the connections among neurons with a different spike frequency affect the synchronised behaviour .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section ii we introduce the hodgkin - huxley neuronal model . in section iii , we show the random neuronal network . in section iv",
    ", we study the synchronisation considering spike timing - dependent plasticity . finally , in the last section , we draw the conclusions .",
    "one of the most important models in computational neuroscience is the neuronal model proposed by hodgkin and huxley @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the mechanism of generation of an action potential was elucidated in a series of experiments with the squid giant axon .",
    "they found three different ions currents consisting of sodium ( na ) , potassium ( k ) and leak ( l ) mainly due to chlorine .",
    "moreover , there are voltage - dependent channels for sodium , potassium that control the entry and exit of these ions through the cell",
    ". the model is composed of a system of four coupled differential equations given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the membrane capacitance ( measured in @xmath4f/@xmath5 ) , @xmath6 is the membrane potential ( measured in mv ) , the function @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the variable of activation for sodium and potassium , and @xmath9 is the variable of inactivation for sodium .",
    "the functions @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath11 are given by @xmath15 the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the conductance and reversal potentials for each ion .",
    "the constant @xmath18 is an external current density ( measured in @xmath4a/@xmath5 ) that determines a regime of a single spike ( @xmath19a/@xmath5 ) , or a scheme with periodic spikes ( @xmath20a/@xmath5 ) , as illustrated in fig .",

    "we do not consider identical neurons here , and due to this fact , a complete synchronisation is not possible .",

    "increasing the amplitude of the external perturbation , without spike timing - dependent plasticity , the desynchronisation is induced in the neuronal network ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . however , considering stdp in the perturbed network is possible to observe alterations to the dynamic behaviour in relation to synchronised states .",
    "figure [ fig7](b ) shows that the stdp enhances the synchronisation for @xmath25 approximately greater than @xmath76 due to a constructive effect on the dynamics of the synaptic weights . on the other hand , for @xmath25 less than @xmath76",

    "we can see that the time average coupling strength depends on the connections . considering the case for a small percentage of connections from hfn to lfn , the average coupling is small , indicating absence of synchronisation , a situation that changes with increasing the percentage of connections to a synchronised state .",
    "this means that , when the coupling strengths increase , a desynchronised state can suddenly become synchronised .",

    "we have been studying a neuronal network model with spiking neurons .",
    "we have chosen , as local dynamics , the hodgkin - huxley model due to the fact that it has essential features of spiking dynamics .",
    "the hodgkin - huxley model is a coupled set of nonlinear differential equations that describes the ionic basis of the action potential .",

    "we have studied the effects of spike timing - dependent plasticity on the synchronisation in a hodgkin - huxley neuronal network .",
    "studies about spike synchronisation are important to understand not only progressively degenerative neurological disorders , but also processing of the sensory information .",

    "the novelty in this paper is that we have considered a random neuronal network and we have verified that the spike synchronisation depend on the probability of connections . considering a strong external perturbation the spike synchronisation",
    "is suppressed . however , when there is stdp , depending on the probability of connections , the synchronisation in the perturbed network can be improved due to a constructive effect on the synaptic weights .",
    "we have also shown that the direction of synapses has an important role on the effects of spike timing - dependent plasticity on the synchronisation in a random hodgkin - huxley neuronal network .",
