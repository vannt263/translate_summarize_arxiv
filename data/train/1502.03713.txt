    "all active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are powered by gas accreting onto a central supermassive black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a process which emits a significant amount of energy across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "interestingly , a significant number of agns show the presence of local obscuration @xcite at distances @xmath4 1 - 10 pc from the central engine ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nature and origin of the absorbing gas is largely unknown but the gas presents an unique opportunity to study material as it transitions from the galaxy to the agn environment .    superimposed onto the typical @xmath5 @xmath4 1.8 - 2 x - ray power - law in agns ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is an fe k@xmath0 line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the narrow component of the line is observed in a large number of objects @xcite , even in many high - redshift samples @xcite , and the width of the line indicates that it may originate in the obscuring material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , the equivalent width ( ew ) of the fe k@xmath0 line can be as large as several kev ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) which may be a signature of compton thick ( ct ) gas ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . a correlation between the fe k@xmath0 ew and the line - of - sight column density",
    "is observed for columns @xmath6  cm^-2^ indicating that the line is often produced by ct gas in the agn environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the fe k@xmath0 line can be used as an important proxy to study the properties of the obscuring gas around agns .    in recent years",
    ", there have been several monte - carlo models of x - ray reprocessing from a ct torus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , all of these calculations omit dust from the models which in many cases may be present in the x - ray absorbing gas @xcite .",
    "as these models are now being used to determine the gross properties of the obscuring material , it is important to consider the effects of dust on the x - ray reflection spectrum . here , we use cloudy models to show that the inclusion of dust in the distant obscuring gas may have an important impact on the reflected fe k@xmath0 ew .",
    "2 describes the geometrical set up of the models and the calculation procedure .",
    "3 describes the results , and sect .",
    "4 discusses the implications of this study .",
    "the photo - ionization code cloudy v13.02 @xcite , is utilized to study the impact of dust on the reflected iron k@xmath0 line .",
    "although the calculations with cloudy are one dimensional , the code includes multiple grain species with a realistic size distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as a comprehensive treatment of grain physics @xcite , i.e. scattering and absorption of dust based on its size and shape . all calculations assume an agn spectrum with an intrinsic luminosity of 10 ^ 43^ erg s^-1^ in the 2 - 10 kev band and a typical photon index of 1.9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the optical to uv spectrum is characterized by @xmath7 = -1.4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a uv slope of -0.5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a blackbody temperature of 1.4@xmath8 k ( appropriate for a black hole of 10 ^ 7^ @xmath9 accreting at 10% of its eddington rate ) .",
    "the gas irradiated by this spectrum has an uniform hydrogen density , @xmath10 , extended radially outward until it reaches a specified column density , @xmath11 .",
    "the covering factor is fixed at 0.67 , equivalent to a 30@xmath12 opening angle , and calculations are performed for @xmath1 < 24.5 $ ] ( with 0.25 dex spacing ) , and @xmath2 < 8 $ ] ( with a spacing of 1 dex ) .    to study the effects of dust , two sets of models are computed .",
    "the first has gas with solar abundances @xcite and no dust ( nd ) , while the second includes ism dust ( wd ) @xcite . in order to isolate the effects of dust on the reflected spectra ,",
    "the abundances in the gas in the wd models are kept at solar , but the metal abundances are reduced using the depletion factors of @xcite , and @xcite and the gas - to - dust ratio was kept at 151 . to check the self consistency of the two models , the abundances of each element",
    "are added and the overall abundance of elements is consistent within 0.05% in both nd and wd models ; however , the fe abundance in the wd models is 5% higher than nd models .    at high agn luminosities grains may reach the sublimation temperature and return the metals back to the gas phase .",
    "this effect is not easily treated by cloudy , so the inner radius of the illuminated gas is fixed at a distance of 10 pc away from the agn . at this distance",
    "the dust temperature inside the illuminated gas is always below the sublimation temperature of the grains . as a further check on the choice of parameters ,",
    "the reprocessed 12@xmath13 m luminosity of the wd models is compared against the one expected from the 12 @xmath14m - x - ray luminosity relationship @xcite .",
    "depending on @xmath10 , the simulated 12@xmath13 m luminosities are 1.2 - 1.5 times larger than the observationally predicted one .",
    "thus , our simple dusty gas setup will be a reasonable model for the average properties of a seyfert - type agn .",
    "finally , to study the effects of dust on the fe k@xmath0 emission line , the equivalent width ( ew ) of the line is analyzed as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath10 for both sets of models .",
    "the ew is defined as the ratio of the intensity of the fe k@xmath0 emission line ( @xmath15 ) to the reflected continuum at the line energy ( @xmath16 ) multiplied by the energy bin width ( @xmath17 ) :    @xmath18    ideally , @xmath16 should be measured at 6.4 kev , but because of the presence of the emission line , it is difficult to determine @xmath16 at that energy . therefore , @xmath16 is measured at 6.3 kev as there are no predicted emission lines at that energy . using a different @xmath16 between 6.3 kev and 6.5 kev leads to only very small changes in the ew .",
    "rather than measuring @xmath15 from the predicted spectrum , we use the emergent line intensities reported in the cloudy output since it takes into account the effects of extinction on the line intensities . in the nd models ,",
    "the fe k@xmath0 emission line comes from cold gas ( e.g * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in the wd models it comes from both cold gas and grains which are added to obtain @xmath15 . the cold fe k@xmath0 fluorescence line defined by cloudy is actually emitted between 6.4 to 6.424 kev for fe i to fe xiv @xcite ; therefore , we set @xmath17 = 24 ev in eq .",
    "1 . as a consistency check ,",
    "the ew calculation was compared with the result from ikeda et al .",
    "our results predict the nd fe k@xmath0 ew to be @xmath19 kev for @xmath11 = 10 ^ 24^ @xmath20 and @xmath10 = 10 ^ 7^ @xmath21 which is slightly lower than the ew @xmath3 2 kev predicted from the monte carlo simulations of @xcite . however , given the differences in computational techniques and physical setup , this difference is adequate .",
    "in addition , we are focused on the relative changes in the ew when dust is included in the irradiated gas .",
    "figure 1 shows how the fe k@xmath0 ew depends on @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "the left panel of figure 1 , shows that the fe k@xmath0 ew increases with @xmath11 for compton thin gas ( 10 ^ 22^ @xmath22 10 ^ 24^ cm^-2^ ) .",
    "such a dependency is expected since the amount of illuminated gas increases with @xmath11 and this produces more fe k@xmath0 emission . for compton thick gas ( @xmath23 10 ^ 24^ @xmath20 ) , the amount of gas irradiated by x - rays is limited by compton scattering and the fe k@xmath0 ew is fairly invariant with @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , the ew of fe k@xmath0 increases with @xmath10 in both the nd and wd models due to the rise in total opacity with @xmath10 .",
    "this reduces @xmath16 and therefore increases the ew .",
    "our calculation shows that the presence of dust may significantly enhance the fe k@xmath0 ew .",
    "the right panel of figure 1 shows that the ew of the fe k@xmath0 line is increased by a factor of  2.5 for @xmath10 = 10 ^ 6^ cm^-3^ ( for @xmath11 @xmath24 10 ^ 24^ cm^-2^ ) due to presence of grains . for @xmath10 = 10 ^ 7^ and 10 ^ 8^ cm^-3^ , the ew is enhanced by a factor of  4.1 and  8 , respectively . to illustrate the reason for this enhancement , fig .",
    "2 plots @xmath16 and @xmath25 ratios vs. @xmath11 .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the change in ew between wd and nd is due to the reduction in the continuum and not because of a change in @xmath25 .",
    "( @xmath25 does slightly increase due to the presence of grains , but this is largely due to the abundances in the models nd and wd not being perfectly self consistent ; the fe abundance is  5% higher in wd models .",
    "therefore , it is expected to have slightly more fe k@xmath0 emission line in the case of wd . )         fig .",
    "2 shows the increase in ew of fe k@xmath0 when reflected by dusty gas is due to a reduced continuum .",
    "this suppressed reflection continuum is due to the reduction in backscattering opacity ( @xmath26 ) in dusty gas .",
    "3 shows how @xmath26 varies inside the column of an illuminated gas as a function of depth for wd and nd models for @xmath11 = 10 ^ 24^ cm^-2^ and @xmath10 = 10 ^ 7^ cm^-3^. at depths @xmath24 10 ^ 13^ cm , h is no longer ionized and dust contributes significantly to the scattering opacity ; therefore , @xmath26 decreases significantly deep inside the cloud in wd models compared to the nd models .",
    "this drop in @xmath26 due to dust is because scattering from grains is highly anisotropic and favor scattering in the forward direction by an amount depending on the size , structure and shape of the grains @xcite .",
    "since the wavelength of x - rays is smaller than the size of most grains , there is only a weak coupling between the radiation and the grain leading to anisotropic scattering .",
    "as the fe ew is computed using the backscattered continuum , this anisotropic scattering will reduce the backscattered intensity for wd models and thus the ew increases .",
    "it has been proposed that dust in an agn environment has fewer small grains than the typical ism distribution @xcite . as @xmath27 is proportional to grain size @xcite , a grain size distribution deficient in small grains",
    "will likely produce a stronger reflection continuum and thus the fe k@xmath0 ew will not increase as strongly as with the ism grains . to check this effect",
    "we computed a cloudy model ( @xmath10=10 ^ 7^ cm^-3^ , @xmath11 = 10 ^ 24^ cm^-2^ ) with orion abundances that includes a grain size distribution deficient in small grains .",
    "the @xmath27 from this model is overplotted on fig . 3 to compare against the results from the nd and wd calculations .",
    "as expected , the orion @xmath27 is larger than the one using ism grains , but still smaller than the model with no dust .",
    "the ew of the fe k@xmath0 line is enhanced by a factor of @xmath3 4 with the ism grains , and by a factor of @xmath3 2.6 with the orion grains .",
    "hence , the anisotropic scattering behaviour of grains may still have an observable impact on the fe k@xmath0 ew if the smaller grains are not present .",
    "many groups have computed two dimensional x - ray reflection models for agn torii without taking into account the effects of grains ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is possible that distant x - ray reflectors arise from dusty gas @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fe k@xmath0 line is an important proxy to estimate the column density of distant observing gas @xcite .",
    "therefore , we used cloudy to compute simple one - dimensional models of dusty gas illuminated by an agn in order to study the effects of dust on fe k@xmath0 emission line .",
    "we found that the presence of dust may significantly enhance the fe k@xmath0 ew ( by factors of @xmath28 ) in the reflection spectrum even in non - ct gas .",
    "when grains are present in the gas , scattering is anisotropic and there are less backscattered photons in the reflected continuum and the overall continuum intensity is decreased .",
    "this suggests that inferring a ct @xmath11 from the fe k@xmath0 ew can be precarious .",
    "the increase in ew occurs when dust dominates @xmath27 and therefore will be most important when the gas contains predominantly neutral hydrogen .",
    "this limits the reflecting cloud to be relatively distant from the nucleus or to have a significant density .",
    "therefore , the fe k@xmath0 ew enhacement may only be important for a certain subset of agns that exhibit infrared emission from agn heated dust , a large fe k@xmath0 ew , and an unusually weak compton reflection component .",
    "for example , ngc 7213 is observed to have significant hot dust emission @xcite , an fe k@xmath0 ew @xmath29  ev , and a very weak compton reflection component @xcite .",
    "similary , ngc 2210 also shows strong dust emission @xcite and is observed to have an fe k@xmath0 ew of @xmath30 ev from compton thin gas @xcite .",
    "although a broad - line region origin for the fe k@xmath0 line is a possibility @xcite , our results also suggest that reprocessing from the dusty compton thin gas in the absorber may also contribute to the fe k@xmath0 line .",
    "we conclude that the anisotropic scattering behavior of grains is an important mechanism to take into account when modeling x - ray reflection from torii since it may have a significant effect on the predicted fe k@xmath0 ew . however , the effects of geometry are important .",
    "since the scattering behavior of grains directly affects the continuum , the effects of grains depends on the viewing angle relative to the orientation of torus , therefore the true magnitude of the effect needs to be studied in multi - dimensional models .",
    "the ew of the emission line may be reduced , enhanced or unchanged since the continuum can be the transmitted spectrum , reflected spectrum , incident spectrum or their combination depending on the viewing angle .",
