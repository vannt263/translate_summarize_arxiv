    "recent evidence has suggested that the star formation activity of the universe peaks at redshifts between 1 and 3 , and as such an understanding of the systems involved in forming stars at these cosmological redshifts is of great importance .",
    "of particular interest are the luminous submillimetre galaxies , or smgs @xcite , which peak strongly at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "first detected with the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba , @xcite ) , these sub - mm selected ( s@xmath6 mjy ) systems have prodigious star formation rates an order of magnitude greater than optically - selected galaxies at comparable redshifts ( @xmath71000 m@xmath8 yr@xmath9 ) , large reservoirs of molecular gas ( @xmath10 ; @xcite ) , and are thought to contribute a substantial fraction of the total cosmic star formation rate density at their peak epoch ( @xmath11 at @xmath1 ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "being sub - mm selected , the bolometric emission from these systems is dominated by cold dust ( @xmath12 k ) , and they are relatively faint at 24@xmath13 m and in the x - ray , indicating that the contribution from an agn component is generally negligible .",
    "observations of co structures in smgs have generally suggested relatively small spatial extents @xcite , typically having half light radii on the order 2 kpc .",
    "this , combined with the massive reservoir of gas in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , leads to a very high density ( up to two orders of magnitude denser than their optically - selected counterparts - @xcite ) which triggers the intense star bursting behaviour that is characteristic of the smg population .",
    "many authors have concluded that the smgs are therefore ` scaled up ' versions of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , galaxies with l@xmath14 ) , in the local universe , being a population of compact star forming galaxies driven by major mergers with co sizes comparable to the radii of the entire galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the star formation is concentrated entirely in the dense circumnuclear region .",
    "recent work has drawn upon evidence from features in the mid - ir ( for example pah emission in the study of @xcite , and near - ir colours in the work of @xcite ) , using measures of the extinction to infer that the star forming region in smgs is extended on scales of @xmath15 kpc ; proportionally far larger than anything seen in local ulirgs .",
    "it remains to be seen , therefore , whether conventional star formation prescriptions applicable to galaxies in the low redshift universe can account for the extreme star forming behaviour seen in smgs .",
    "in this paper we report iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) observations of three high - redshift star forming sources .",
    "combined merlin+vla radio continuum observations are used to analyse the spatially resolved star formation behaviour ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , in combination with the spatially resolved information on the molecular gas content provided by the pdbi , to attempt to analyse the connection between the gas content and star formation behaviour in these extreme high - redshift systems .",
    "the high - resolution of both the pdbi and merlin observations allow the sizes of the co and star forming regions to be ascertained accurately and independently , allowing for accurate measurements of both the sfr surface density and the molecular gas surface density .",
    "as such , we can place our sources into the context of the kennicutt - schmidt law , which has been proposed as a possible ` universal star formation law ' @xcite .    in  2 ,",
    "we outline the observations behind this work , and in  2.3 we outline the techniques used to analyse our data . in ",
    "3 we individually discuss our galaxies , in terms of their co properties , star formation behaviour , and kinematical parameters .  4 contains further discussion of merger vs. disc scenarios and star formation efficiencies for our galaxies , and attempts to place them in the context of a kennicutt - schmidt star formation law , and we conclude in  5 .    throughout this work",
    "we assume a concordance @xmath16cdm cosmology with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "we aim to compare matched beam ( @xmath20 ) observations of mid - excitation co lines and radio continua in a selection of @xmath1 ulirgs , two in the hubble deep field north and one in the lockman hole , whose optical counterparts have been identified as hdf132 ( @xmath21 ) , hdf254 ( @xmath22 ) , and lockman 38 ( @xmath23 ) respectively . in this work they are referred to as such hereafter .",
    "this project was undertaken with a long - term goal of including similarly high resolution of the resolved sub - mm continuum in order to fully characterise the nature of star formation , gas content , and dust in these extreme systems .",
    "we have chosen three sources with good co detections which have been well detected with merlin radio observations .",
    "in particular , the radio properties of the three sources were chosen to be representative of the smg radio population as a whole ( see @xcite ) , which has @xmath24 being extended in the radio ( hdf254 ) , and @xmath25 being radio compact ( hdf132 and lockman 38 ) , so the large co structures discussed below do not result from a selection bias .",
    "the three sources also span the complete range of @xmath1 ulirg spectral energy distribution ( sed ) types - lockman 38 suggests a unusually cold sed , with a dust temperature t@xmath26k .",
    "hdf254 suggests a hot sed , with a t@xmath27 of @xmath28k @xcite : it is strong in the radio , weak in the sub - mm , and has significant 70@xmath29 m emission - it is , in fact , one of the few @xmath30 ulirgs ( @xmath31% ) detected by spitzer at 70@xmath29 m .",
    "hdf132 is intermediate between these two sources , with an estimated t@xmath27 of 40k @xcite .",
    "we observed co rotation lines in the sub - mm faint star forming radio galaxy ( sfrg ) rgj123711.34 + 621331.0 (= hdf254 ) , the sub - mm galaxy smmj123618.33 + 621550.5 (= hdf132 ) , and the smg smmj105307 + 572431.4 (= lockman 38 ) during february and march 2009 , using between 4 and 6 of the antennas ( of a total of 6 ) .",
    "all sources were observed with the ` long baseline ' a configuration .",
    "hdf132 was observed in @xmath2co(j=4@xmath33 ) on 2009 february 15 and february 19 , with on - source integration times of 8.9 and 2.9 hours respectively .",
    "four of the six antennas were used .",
    "the observed frequency of the @xmath2co(j=4@xmath33 ) line was 154.004 ghz , putting the co - derived redshift at @xmath32 .",
    "hdf254 was observed in @xmath2co(j=4@xmath33 ) on 2009 february 16 with a total integration time of 6.2 hours , using five antennas .",
    "@xmath2co(j=4@xmath33 ) was observed at 154.122 ghz , setting the source at @xmath33 .",
    "lockman 38 was observed with all six antennas on 2009 february 20 and 2009 march 12 , with on - source integration times of 5.6 hours and 3.2 hours respectively .",
    "@xmath2co(j=3@xmath32 ) was observed at 154.122 ghz , setting the source at @xmath34 .",
    "the synthesised beam size at 154 ghz is @xmath35 0.4(see panel insets ) , @xmath363.4 kpc at the redshifts of our sources .",
    "the smg smmj123711.98 + 621325.7 (= hdf255 ) was also within the field , being just 7  south - east of hdf254 .",
    "it was , however , undetected with our long baseline configuration observations , which can be attributed to a combination of primary beam attenuation effects , and the co source being sufficiently extended that all the flux is resolved out , consistent with a large radio size ( @xmath37 kpc ) from merlin as reported by @xcite .",
    "we include hdf255 in our compilation of smgs from the literature , however , and use the fact that it was undetected in our high resolution observations to place a lower limit on the source diameter of 1  ( hence , all surface densities derived for hdf255 will strictly be upper limits ) .",
    "all sources were observed in good meteorological conditions , and typical system temperatures were 80 - 250k .",
    "antenna efficiencies were typically 25 - 35 jy k@xmath9 .",
    "bright quasars ( primarily 3c84 and 3c273 ) were used for flux calibration .",
    "all data were reduced using the clic and mapping routines as part of the iram gildas package , and the resultant data cubes were rebinned to a frequency resolution of 20 mhz ( a velocity spacing of 38 km s@xmath9 ) , before analysis with our own idl routines .",
    "high resolution observations of the galaxies radio continua were obtained using the multi - element radio linked interferometer network ( merlin ; @xcite ) , combined with the vla .",
    "radio data for the hdf sources were obtained by @xcite , and data for lockman 38 were obtained by @xcite .",
    "the fwhm synthesised beam sizes for the maps are ( semi - major axis vs. semi - minor axis in arcsec ) 0.204 x 0.193 , 0.205 x 0.192 , and 0.5 x 0.5 for hdf132 , hdf254 , and lockman 38 respectively .",
    "these beam sizes are all comparable in resolution to the long - baseline configuration beam size of the pdbi .",
    "the high spatial resolution of these observations allows for the star formation regions to be mapped in detail ( rather than returning a single integrated value for the sfr ) , which is useful both for distinguishing point source agn emission from diffuse star formation , and for comparing the extent and shape of the star forming region with the co morphology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "all three of our galaxies were well detected and fully resolved .",
    "figs [ fig : sab1 ] , [ fig : sdb1 ] , and [ fig : sfb1 ] show the co observations and spectra , combined with optical images and merlin+vla radio continuum observations ( as detailed in the captions )",
    ". tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] contain the observational results and other derived parameters .",
    "all lines were successfully detected at a very high level of significance ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the two hdf sources ( 132 and 254 ) have optical images comprised of @xmath39 & @xmath5 band images from the acs , stacked with equal weighting . in the case of hdf132 , nicmos 1.6 micron photometry ( using the f160w filter ) has been added for clarification . there is no acs image for lockman 38 ; instead , we use an @xmath40 band image , taken with the cfh12k instrument on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "being ground - based , this is necessarily a lower - resolution image than the _",
    "hst_-acs photometry , with a resolution of @xmath41 .",
    "the middle panels of figs [ fig : sab1 ] , [ fig : sdb1 ] , and [ fig : sfb1 ] also show the co data colour coded by velocity .",
    "these were created as follows : each data cube has a channel range across which the signal to noise of the source is maximised . for each source ,",
    "this channel range was then split into three equal bins , and the co flux for each point on the map was integrated for each bin separately .",
    "this results in three separate maps of the source , corresponding to the three bins in channel space ( or three bins in velocity space ) .",
    "these three maps were then colour - coded appropriately and stacked .",
    "the star formation rate given in table [ tab2 ] has been derived using the empirically calibrated fir - radio correlation , taken from @xcite , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the luminosity distance in metres , @xmath44 is the radio flux density at 1.4 ghz ( in w m@xmath45 hz@xmath9 ) , and @xmath46 is the synchrotron slope used to k - correct the 1.4 ghz observations to the appropriate source redshift ( @xmath46 is taken here to be 0.8 ) .",
    "the l@xmath47-sfr conversion was taken from : @xmath48 it is important to note that several assumptions underlie the direct conversion between @xmath49 and a sfr ; namely that all the uv radiation produced by young stars is absorbed by dust and re - radiated in the ir , and that the dust heating is brought about by a young stellar population ( @xmath50 myr ) . if the stellar population is more evolved , the true sfr can be lower than that derived using the equation above by up to a factor of 2 .",
    "co flux densities were estimated by fitting a gaussian profile to the spectrum . from this",
    ", we calculate the co luminosities using the relation given by @xcite ; @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is the co flux in jy km s@xmath9 , @xmath53 is the frequency of the observed co line in ghz , and the luminosity distance @xmath54 is in mpc ) , from which molecular gas masses were derived using a conversion factor appropriate to local ulirgs of @xmath55 ( see @xcite for discussion ) .",
    "these molecular gas masses have been derived from co luminosities resulting from moderate - excitation transitions ( either 4@xmath33 or 3@xmath32 ) ; the extrapolation of an accurate gas mass , therefore , requires a derivation of a co(1@xmath30 ) flux density .",
    "we use the brightness temperature conversions derived from sed modelling of smgs by @xcite , which leads to the following line ratios ( as reported by @xcite ) : s@xmath56/s@xmath57 ; s@xmath58/s@xmath59 .",
    "most ulirgs are thermalised up to at least the co(3@xmath32 ) transition , so using these mid - excitation lines ( j@xmath60 3 or 4 ) should not significantly reduce the extent of the co emission region when compared to observations of co(1@xmath30 ) .",
    "any size difference will be due to the fact that the higher order transitions trace the actively star forming gas , ( which is of interest to us ) whereas the lower transitions trace the cold gas either in the outer halo , or accreting onto the galaxy .",
    "use of the long baseline ` a ' configuration will inevitably resolve out flux when compared to observations made with more compact configurations .",
    "for hdf132 and hdf254 we compare our gas masses derived from our observations to those derived using the pdbi ` d ' configuration , to get an estimate of how much flux has been lost , which is typically a factor of @xmath4 . for lockman 38 , which has not been observed in ` d ' configuration , we estimate a true gas mass based on the mean flux lost for the other two sources .",
    "we use the ( more complete ) ` d ' configuration - derived gas masses when calculating gas surface densities for all systems .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab2 ]                      hdf132 is both the brightest of our three sources at millimetre wavelengths , and the most highly obscured ( being virtually undetected in the optical ) , implying an extremely high column density of dust .",
    "however , it is detected in the ir ( as evidenced by the nicmos f160w imaging , which was obtained by @xcite as part of pid @xmath6111082 ) , and is sub - mm bright , with a scuba 850@xmath29 m flux of @xmath62 mjy .",
    "the strong 1.4 ghz continuum luminosity implies a high rate of extinction - corrected star formation .",
    "this is calculated ( from the radio continuum , using the methods described above ) to be @xmath63 m@xmath8 yr @xmath9 ( here and throughout , quoted errors on the sfr represent fractional errors in the measured radio flux density , and do not take into account other uncertainties , for example scatter in the l@xmath47-radio correlation ) . the velocity - coded image in the centre of fig .",
    "[ fig : sab1 ] shows what appears to be either a disc - type structure or a late stage merger .",
    "spectra taken at separate points along the source ( see positional arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : sab1 ] ) reveal the co spectrum to be double peaked at all points , with the relative intensity of the peaks varying along the axis of the source .",
    "( the spectra have been more coarsely binned , to 40 mhz [ @xmath64 km s@xmath9 ] for clarity ) . this could possibly be indicative of a ` beam smearing ' effect , whereby the size of the beam ( see inset ellipse ) causes both velocity components to be detected .",
    "however , the position in velocity space of each peak is approximately constant across the galaxy , with just their respective strengths varying .",
    "this , coupled with the relatively small beam size ( 0.4  - smaller than the source ) , suggests that the two peaks may be components of line of sight rotation .    the position - velocity diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sab1 ] , bottom left ) shows evidence for ordered gas motion , with two distinct clumps separated in velocity space ; while they do overlap in physical space they are offset somewhat ( resulting in the two peaks changing in intensity along the axis ) , this could be a signature of rotation ( e.g. ) , but also may be indicative of a late stage merger .",

    "the top panel compares the co and the 1.4 ghz flux density at each point .",
    "the small size of the source ( d @xmath73 1 ) only allows for four points to be taken with enough s / n to allow robust spectra to be taken .",
    "this precludes the full elucidation of the velocity behaviour that would be able to characterise the source as either a rotating disc or a merger .",
    "however , using the velocity dispersion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sab1_k ] , middle panel ) it is possible to estimate the lower limit on @xmath74 ( see @xcite ) , a simple way of characterising the system as either ` rotation - dominated ' ( @xmath75 or ` dispersion - dominated ' ( @xmath76 ) discs typically have ( @xmath74 ) @xmath77 @xcite , whereas high-@xmath5 star forming discs have ( @xmath74 ) of order unity to a few ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . ] . the mean velocity dispersion is @xmath78 km s@xmath9 and @xmath79 km s@xmath9 for the red and blue components respectively , leading to a @xmath80 .",
    "this is , to first order , comparable to the value claimed for other high redshift star forming discs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "given the fact that it is not apparently dispersion - dominated , and that it is homogeneous , compact , and non - clumpy on scales @xmath81 , we identify hdf132 as a disc - type structure , as opposed to an early - stage major merger ( although of course a late - stage major - merger remnant is very difficult to distinguish from a true secular disc given the limitations of our observations ) .",

    "recent simulations of giant galaxies at high redshifts of @xmath1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have suggested that extended co discs can form entirely secularly , without a major - merging event . in this ` smooth accretion ' model , the systems formed are ` harassed ' massive galaxies , which are being rapidly formed by filamentary accretion of material from the igm .",

    "it is this final coalescence that boosts the star formation rate and 850@xmath29 m flux , which causes the system to be classed as an smg , or more generally a ulirg . the reasonably bright 850@xmath29 m flux ( @xmath155 mjy ) and high star formation rate ( @xmath156 m@xmath8 yr@xmath9 ) argue against hdf132 being an inspiralling merger , suggesting instead that the final coalescence has already occurred .",

    "the prevailing paradigm of smgs being major mergers leads naturally to the conclusion that their molecular gas will be concentrated in a compact nuclear region : tidal torquing induced by the merger drives cold molecular gas into the centre of the galaxy , where it is heated , becomes gravitationally unstable , and triggers a starbursting event .",

    "is difficult , however , as the true value is a complex function of many physical parameters , including the gas metallically , and the column density and temperature of the intersteller gas ( @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical justification for using a significantly lower conversion factor for ulirgs than normal star - forming galaxies hinges on the nature of merger - induced star formation . whereas ` normal ' star formation occurs in gravitationally bound molecular clouds ( which exist as well defined separate structures in the ism ) , the torque induced by a merger event creates a more centralised , homogeneous molecular ism , in which pressure plays a significant role in triggering a star forming event .",
    "this difference ( gravitationally - confined vs. pressure confined star forming gas ) theoretically justifies the use of a different conversion factor .",
    "empirically , it is found that using a standard galactic conversion factor for ulirgs often results in derived gas masses greater than their dynamical masses , necessitating the adoption of a lower value .    the paradigm of smgs being ` scaled up ' versions of local ulirgs",
    "has led to these lower values of @xmath170 being adopted by most authors ( i.e. @xmath171 by @xcite ; @xmath172 by @xcite ) , which has led to a predominance of low assumed gas fractions for smgs , which typically have values of f@xmath166 (= m@xmath166/m@xmath167 ) between 0.1 and 0.3 .",

    "in addition , obtaining accurate gas masses via co measurements is highly time consuming , requiring on - source integration times of several hours ; as such , obtaining well constrained gas masses for a statistically significant sample of high-@xmath5 star forming galaxies would be prohibitively expensive in terms of instrument time .",
    "one way around this is to infer a gas mass based on the ( more easily measurable ) h@xmath46 emission size and star formation rate ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig : ks ] shows our three sources in the context of the ks law .",
    "the smaller size of the 1.4 ghz emission region ( respective to the co emission region ) leads to the three sources presented in this work lying significantly above the @xmath182 ks relation , and above the high-@xmath5 ulirgs previously examined .",
    "this indicates an extremely high efficiency of star formation respective to the gas density .",
    "even lockman 38 - which may be forming stars an order of magnitude slower than a typical smg ( as per the discussion above ) - has such an extended co morphology and compact radio emission that its gas surface density is lower than would be expected given its sfr , causing it to lie above the high-@xmath5 ks relation . both hdf132 and hdf254 lie significantly ( @xmath185 dex ) off the ks slope",
    ": it is likely to be a combination of the extended co morphology and compact radio emission which conspire to move the sources above the relation .",
    "as discussed above however , this finding is dependent on the assumption of a merger - appropriate co / h@xmath162 conversion factor for our sources , which may be significantly underestimating the gas content for our galaxies , particularly the disc - like hdf132 which has a gas fraction of 5% assuming a ulirg - appropriate conversion factor .",
    "if the smaller conversion factor is rejected and instead a milky way factor is used , then our galaxies fall very close to the high-@xmath5 ks relation of @xcite .    using our independent measurements of the merlin - observed star forming regions and the co morphology ,",
    "we have also re - calculated @xmath151 and @xmath88 for smgs from the literature : these properties are presented in table [ tab3 ] . for consistency , all gas surface densities have been adjusted to a common co / h@xmath162 conversion factor of @xmath179 ( though an error bar again delineates the possible range of values , up to the standard milky way value ) , and all smg molecular gas masses have had a helium correction factor of 1.36 applied .",
    "these archival smgs are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ks ] .",
    "there appears to be an offset between the smgs presented in this work ( both newly observed and archival ) and the ks relation for high-@xmath5 star forming galaxies claimed by @xcite , which suggests that obtaining an estimate of a galaxy s gas mass by inverting the canonical ks law can give unreliable results .",
    "furthermore , as explained above the offset between our sources and other suggested ks law slopes is , perhaps , partly attributable to a combination of uncertainties in the co / h@xmath162 conversion factor and star formation rates for this type of system , but could also provide evidence that stars are formed more efficiently in these extreme systems .",
    "if this is the case , then it may be that a ` universal star formation law ' , which provides a consistent power - law relationship between gas content and star formation across all systems and environments , is not achievable , or at least does not apply in the most extreme cases .",
    "we have presented high resolution ( sub - arcsecond ) detections of molecular gas in three @xmath1 star forming galaxies , two smgs and one sfrg .",
    "we used extracted spectra to constrain co fluxes , and extrapolated total molecular gas masses .",
    "we analysed the kinematic behaviour of the sources revealed in the co imaging on 0.15  scales , equal to @xmath67 of the beam fwhm .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * one of our galaxies is unequivocally an early stage major merger ( hdf254 ) with high velocity dispersion and a minimal rotational contribution .",
    "lockman 38 appears to be a late stage merger , with a low velocity dispersion and a smooth morphology , but with significantly disturbed gas kinematics revealed by the position - velocity diagram .",
    "the remaining detected source ( hdf132 ) appears - to the limits of our data - consistent with being a disc - like rotating body , with double peaked profiles indicative of rotation and a homogeneous , non - clumpy morphology .",
    "these features may be explainable with a late stage merger model , or may be evidence of a star forming disc .",
    "* there is a marked discrepancy between the sizes of the co and 1.4 ghz radio emission regions in our high - resolution data , with the radio emission region ( which traces star formation ) being more compact than the co region in all cases .",
    "this has important implications for our understanding of star formation in high-@xmath5 starburst galaxies , particularly in relation to the role of gas reservoirs , and whether starburst galaxies tend to be fuelled by cold flow accretion , or minor mergers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "* this size difference leads to an exacerbation of the offset of smgs from the kennicutt - schmidt star formation law , which has already been shown to be significant ( see @xcite for a compilation of recent findings in this area ) . *",
    "the adoption of a low , ulirg - like co / h@xmath162 conversion factor for smgs leads to very low gas fractions of @xmath186 , which is far lower than would be expected given their extreme sfr .",
    "the adoption of a milky way conversion factor ( which is somewhat theoretically supported ) raises the gas mass by a factor of 5 .",
    "* this size difference also manifests in the form of a star formation efficiency variation , with ` sub clumps ' of our sources differing in in efficiency by up to a factor of @xmath187",
    ". however , the global properties of each source are consistent with the canonical l@xmath161-l@xmath47 relation for similarly extreme ( and sub - mm bright ) systems . *",
    "these are the first pdbi observed ` a ' configuration observations of high-@xmath5 ulirgs for co(4@xmath33 ) , achieving the smallest beam size yet for an intermediate - excitation transition at a redshift of @xmath352 .",
    "the modest exposure times required ( 6 antenna equivalent of @xmath35 8 hours ) , the small loss of flux ( a factor of 1.9 on average ) , and the detailed morphologies and kinematic information revealed suggest that this is a profitable approach for similar investigations in the future .",
