    "the interaction between species in the ecosystem is described by the fitnesses @xmath4 , which generally depend on the whole set of populations .",
    "they may also include the effect of migration from and toward the system .",
    "it can be straightforwardly shown that the frequency of species @xmath2 in the whole population , @xmath5 , satisfies the evolution equation @xmath6 assuming that the fitnesses can be given as functions of @xmath7 gives a closed set of equations for the frequencies , usually referred to as the _ replicator equations _ @xcite .",
    "note that the replicator equations admit an alternative interpretation as the evolution equations for the populations instead of the frequencies of an @xmath0-species ecosystem . since for all times @xmath8 ( see also sect .",
    "[ ii ] ) , this would correspond to an ecosystem with fixed total population , presumably saturating the carrying capacity of its environment . within this interpretation , thus , the replicator equations describe an ensemble of biological species with global competition , which limits the growth of the whole population to the carrying capacity of the environment , and subject to interactions that affect the individual fitnesses .",
    "the replicator model has found many applications in biological evolutionary problems at various levels .",
    "it has been first considered in connection with the evolution of biomolecular concentrations in the early stages of life on the earth @xcite . in the frame of game theory , in close connection with biological evolution @xcite",
    ", it has been used to describe the dynamics of strategy frequencies in multi - player games @xcite . as a basic model of an ecosystem",
    ", it was discussed by schuster and sigmund @xcite , who coined the term _",
    "replicator_. the discrete - time version of eqs .",
    "( [ repf ] ) @xcite constitutes a well - known model for the evolution of genetic frequencies in asexual haploid populations @xcite .",
    "most of these applications assume that the fitnesses depend linearly on the frequencies , @xmath9 , so that the replicator equations reduce to @xmath10 the matrix @xmath11 is frequently called _ fitness matrix _ and , from the viewpoint of game theory , plays the role of a payoff matrix .",
    "it can be shown that the replicator equations with linear fitness are formally equivalent to a multi - species lotka - volterra model @xcite .    in spite of the large potential of the replicator equations to model evolutionary biological systems , the dynamical properties of their solutions",
    "are poorly understood . besides the specific applications quoted above , generic mathematical properties of the replicator model are known for very special situations only @xcite .",
    "typically , they involve a small number of biological species with quite unrealistic interaction patterns .",
    "real ecosystems , on the other hand , usually involve tens of species with hundreds of food - web links @xcite .",
    "our aim in this paper is to approach this complex reality by exploring the replicator dynamics for large ecosystems with nontrivial interaction patterns .",
    "we deal with the problem from a statistical point of view and perform extensive numerical calculations , focusing on a probabilistic description of survival and extinction of species in terms of the parameters that define their interaction .    in the next two sections we present mainly for completeness and subsequent reference various , rather general mathematical properties of the replicator equations , including symmetry properties and stability conditions for special classes of random interaction patterns .",
    "then , in the main part of the paper , we numerically study more complex situations for the case of linear fitness , including multi - diagonal and disordered fitness matrices .",
    "our results , which we interpret in connection with the average interaction of each species with the rest of the ecosystem , are summarized and discussed in the last section .",
    "for future reference , let us begin discussing the invariance properties of the replicator model ( [ repf ] ) . in the first place , since the variables @xmath12 are defined as population fractions , @xmath13 , the conditions @xmath14 and @xmath8 must hold at all times . equations ( [ repf ] ) are compatible with these conditions , because the set @xmath15 is invariant under their action . in fact , the transverse component of @xmath16 vanishes on the boundary of @xmath17 , and @xmath18 identically vanishes in @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , an initial condition in @xmath17 generates a trajectory which remains within this set . from now on ,",
    "we restrict the analysis of eqs .",
    "( [ repf ] ) to @xmath17 , where the dynamics is effectively @xmath19-dimensional .",
    "in fact , @xmath17 is an @xmath19-dimensional polyhedron embedded in the @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "equations ( [ repf ] ) have moreover two important symmetries .",
    "first , multiplication of all the fitnesses by the same constant @xmath20 , is equivalent to a linear change of the temporal scale , @xmath21 .",
    "second , addition of the same constant to all the fitnesses , @xmath22 leaves the equations invariant .",
    "this second symmetry implies that any meaningful result regarding the replicator dynamics will be given in terms of differences between fitnesses , rather than in terms of their individual values .",
    "note , in fact , that eqs .",
    "( [ repf ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath23 for linear fitness , eqs .",
    "( [ sys ] ) , the above symmetries respectively amount to multiplying and adding a constant to each element of the fitness matrix @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "( [ sys ] ) to @xmath17 will be referred to as the replicator equations .",
    "the two summations in the right hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ sys ] ) couple the dynamics of the species in different ways .",
    "the first summation , @xmath28 , coincides with the fitness of species @xmath2 , and is a direct measure of the effect of the whole ecosystem on the reproductive success of that species . the coefficient @xmath29 , in fact , weights the contribution of species @xmath30 to the fitness of @xmath2 .",
    "the second summation , @xmath31 is the average fitness in the ecosystem , and acts as a global coupling .",
    "this `` interaction '' a negative contribution for positive @xmath32 is responsible for the preservation of the normalization of @xmath33 .",
    "the invariance of the system under summation of a constant to the fitness , quoted in sect .",
    "[ ii ] , implies that all dynamical features in the replicator model depend on the fitness matrix @xmath24 through differences between its elements . as a matter of fact",
    ", we find that a set of relevant quantities in the characterization of such features is given by the differences @xmath34 .",
    "they compare the contribution of species @xmath30 to the evolution of @xmath2 with its self - contribution .",
    "we call @xmath35 the _ attitude _ of species @xmath30 toward species @xmath2 . a positive attitude ,",
    "@xmath36 , indicates that species @xmath30 contributes to the growth of @xmath2 more than to its own growth .",
    "it is therefore an _",
    "altruistic _ attitude . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath37 stands for an _",
    "egoistic _ attitude . by definition ,",
    "the `` self - attitudes '' @xmath38 are all zero . as we show in the following , the stability properties of many of the equilibria of eqs .",
    "( [ sys ] ) can be given in terms of the attitudes @xmath35 .",
    "for large @xmath0 , eqs .",
    "( [ sys ] ) have generally a large number of fixed points .",
    "they can be classified by their number of non - vanishing coordinates , i.e. by the number of surviving species at each fixed point .",
    "there are @xmath0 fixed points with only one surviving species .",
    "the coordinates of these points are all zero except that corresponding to the surviving species , which equals unity .",
    "we emphasize that such equilibrium points , situated at the _ vertices _ of @xmath17 , always exist , independently of the values of the coefficients @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast , the number of fixed points with @xmath39 surviving species ( @xmath40 ) depends on @xmath29 .",
    "we do know , however , that @xmath41 is an upper bound for this number .",
    "these equilibrium points lie on the _ edges _ of the polyhedron @xmath17 .",
    "finally , only one equilibrium with @xmath0 surviving species can exist @xcite .",
    "we call it the _ coexistence _ fixed point .",
    "if it exists , its coordinates satisfy @xmath42 for all @xmath2 .    for a general fitness matrix @xmath24 and arbitrary @xmath0",
    ", the linear stability analysis of the fixed points of the replicator equations is quite a difficult task .",
    "still , it is possible to find the general stability conditions for vertices .",
    "the @xmath30-th vertex , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 for all @xmath45 , is linearly stable if and only if @xmath37 for all @xmath45 , i.e. if species @xmath30 is egoistic toward all other species .",
    "note that this condition can be simultaneously verified for several or even all species , in which case the system is multistable .",
    "an important case where the stability analysis can be fully achieved for all the fixed points is that of a diagonal matrix ( @xmath46 for @xmath45 ) , which will be used as a reference case in our statistical analysis of survival and extinction . in this case , as above , the @xmath30-th vertex is linearly stable if and only if @xmath37 or , equivalently , @xmath47 .",
    "the equilibria on the edges of @xmath17 , on the other hand , are always unstable .",
    "meanwhile , the coexistence point is stable if and only if @xmath48 for all @xmath2 , i.e. if all species are altruistic toward all other species .",
    "consequently , if the coexistence point is stable , it is the only stable equilibrium , since the vertices are in turn unstable .",
    "the global stability of the coexistence point follows also from a general theorem for the replicator system with symmetric fitness matrices @xcite .",
    "linear stability analysis can also be carried out explicitly for small values of @xmath0 . for two species ,",
    "the dynamics is effectively one - dimensional .",
    "the phase space @xmath49 can be mapped onto the interval @xmath50 $ ] , where one of the variables ( say @xmath51 ) takes on its values , while @xmath52 at all times . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] we sketch the three possible dynamical scenarios .",
    "coexistence ( fig .  [ f1]a ) occurs when both species have positive attitude toward each other , while bistability ( fig .  [ f1]b ) occurs when both species have negative attitudes .",
    "domination by one of the species takes place when one species is altruistic and the other species is egoistic . in such case",
    "the egoistic species dominates , while the other becomes extinct . for three species",
    "the dynamics is effectively bidimensional , and there is a wider spectrum of dynamical behaviors , including the possibility of existence of heteroclinic cycles @xcite .",
    "in general , we find that stability properties depend not only on the signs of the attitudes @xmath35 , but also on other combinations of the elements @xmath29",
    ".    real ecosystems , however , are known to involve at least several species with complex patterns of interactions @xcite .",
    "the restricting conditions that make the replicator model analytically solvable fall well apart from any situation with biological significance .",
    "we therefore turn our attention to many - species systems with nontrivial interactions . in order to explore an ample class of fitness matrices ,",
    "we choose the elements @xmath29 at random , from prescribed distributions .",
    "this choice calls for a statistical analysis of the results , which in turn require resorting to the numerical resolution of the replicator equations . in the next section",
    "we discuss methods and present results of such analysis .",
    "as advanced above , we analyze in this section the dynamics of the replicator model with a random fitness matrix and for a large number of species . in a generic situation",
    ", the coexistence equilibrium will be unstable and a substantial number of species will become extinct .",
    "we are particularly interested in studying the dependence of the number of surviving species on the distribution of the elements @xmath29",
    ". our ultimate goal would be to identify the ecological attitude that a species should have in order to optimize its probability of surviving within a given population , i.  e. for a given distribution of @xmath29 . from then on , in order to make the description of interactions more compact , we characterize a species @xmath30 by its mean attitude @xmath53 depending on the distribution of @xmath29 , the mean attitudes in a given population will take values in different ranges . for each realization of the evolution of the system , we respectively call @xmath54 and @xmath55 the ( normalized ) distribution of the number of species and of the number of surviving species on @xmath56 . namely , for small @xmath57 , the products @xmath58 and @xmath59 represent , respectively , the total number of species and the number of surviving species in the interval @xmath60 . the average fraction of surviving species as a function of the mean attitude is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 indicates average over realizations , with different @xmath29 and different initial conditions",
    ". the product @xmath63 measures the survival probability of a species with mean attitude between @xmath56 and @xmath64 within the given population .    taking into account the symmetries of the replicator equations ( [ sys ] ) , discussed in sect .",
    "[ ii ] , we have selected a set of distributions for @xmath29 that results to be representative and interesting . in most cases , we fix a significant subset of the matrix elements equal to zero , while the remaining @xmath29 are uniformly distributed on a finite interval .",
    "the subset of null elements can be fixed deterministically or at random over the matrix , and defines a reference level for all the other @xmath29 .",
    "three intervals for the uniform distribution of the nonzero elements will be considered , namely , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 . in this way",
    ", we take into account translations of the distribution of the nonzero elements with respect to the reference value .",
    "note that , on the other hand , the three intervals have the same width . we briefly discuss the effect of changing this width at the end of sect .",
    "[ 4.2 ] .",
    "a special reference case which will also be considered in the following is a fitness matrix where no element is _ a priori _ fixed to zero , and @xmath29 is chosen from the uniform distribution for all @xmath2 and @xmath30 .",
    "this special case is statistically invariant under translations of the interval and changes of its width up to a modification in the time scale .      in the numerical resolution of the replicator equations we face a main difficulty , namely , the dynamical instability of the invariant set @xmath17 . from eqs .",
    "( [ uno ] ) it follows that , depending on the sign of the global coupling term @xmath68 , a small perturbation on the condition @xmath8 may be amplified by the dynamics , driving the system away from @xmath17 .",
    "this is expected to happen in the numerical calculations , due to rounding - off and discretization effects . using a second - order runge - kutta ( rk ) integration algorithm @xcite ,",
    "we have observed departures from @xmath17 for very long times only , typically when the evolution is very slow and the system is close to an unstable fixed point . however , such events prompt us to modify the integration algorithm , in order to ensure permanence on @xmath17 at all times . to solve the problem , we have included a normalization operation at each time step .",
    "after computing the updated variables @xmath69 using the rk algorithm , we compute the sum @xmath70 and renormalize the variables as @xmath71 .",
    "we have exhaustively tested this algorithm and observed that , in the regions where the original rk algorithm does not produce divergences , the solutions by both methods are indistinguishable .",
    "furthermore , for the original rk algorithm we have observed that the perturbations that drive the solution away from @xmath17 are initially of the order of the working precision ( @xmath72 ) , and the corrections introduced by the normalization procedure are of the same order , or @xmath73 at most .",
    "such modifications are therefore much smaller than the discretization error of the rk algorithm , and the effect of normalization on the numerical precision results to be negligible .",
    "we have chosen initial conditions for @xmath12 with uniform distribution over @xmath17 .",
    "they have been generated by drawing @xmath19 uniformly distributed random numbers @xmath74 in @xmath75 , with @xmath76 , and defining @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "after integration over sufficiently long times , the values of @xmath12 corresponding to the species which are in the way of becoming extinct have typically reached extremely low levels .",
    "such levels are usually meaningless from the biological viewpoint .",
    "in fact , the discreteness of biological populations fixes a lower bound of @xmath80 for each @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "since the replicator model does not keep trace of the total population in the ecosystem , we choose as a threshold for extinctions @xmath81 .",
    "if , at the end of the integration , a variable @xmath12 has reached a value below @xmath82 , species @xmath2 is considered to have undergone extinction . to study the evolution of the number of surviving species",
    ", this definition is extended to all times .",
    "surviving species at time @xmath83 are hence defined as those for which @xmath84 .",
    "our value of @xmath82 is essentially arbitrary , but we find that the results are robust with respect to variations in this extinction threshold .",
    "our calculations correspond mostly to the case @xmath85 , though we have verified that our main qualitative conclusions are valid for considerably larger ecosystems .",
    "as indicated above , our statistical analysis requires to average results over realizations with different initial conditions and different matrix elements .",
    "averages were taken over sets of @xmath86 to @xmath87 realizations . in the following , we present the main results of our analysis , which focuses on the evolution of the number of surviving species and on the determination of the survival probability as a function of the mean attitude of each species .",
    "we begin by analyzing , as a reference situation , the case of a diagonal fitness matrix ( @xmath46 for @xmath45 ) .",
    "recall that the stability properties in this case can be worked out exhaustively ( sect .",
    "[ iii ] ) .",
    "note also that , for the diagonal system , @xmath88 is independent of @xmath2 , such that the attitude of each species @xmath30 toward the remaining species is uniform .",
    "when the diagonal elements are drawn at random from then interval @xmath65 , all these elements are negative . in this case",
    "all the species are altruistic , the coexistence point is globally stable , and all the species survive .",
    "the survival probability @xmath89 is thus a flat distribution . in the case",
    "that the diagonal elements are drawn from @xmath90 , typically half of the species those with @xmath91 are altruistic toward any other species , while the other half are egoistic .",
    "the only stable equilibria are the approximately @xmath92 vertices corresponding to the survival of a single species with @xmath47 .",
    "the surviving species is selected , in each realization , by the initial condition .",
    "finally , when the diagonal elements are chosen from @xmath67 , all the species are egoistic and the @xmath0 vertices are stable . these are again the only stable equilibria and only one species survives .",
    "figure [ f2]a shows the evolution of the average number of surviving species for the above three cases .",
    "the corresponding survival probability distributions @xmath89 will be discussed later on , for comparison with other random matrices .",
    "a second case of reference is given , as advanced above , by the situation where no elements of the fitness matrix are _ a priori _ fixed to zero .",
    "we refer to this situation as the full - matrix case . the evolution of the average number of surviving species for the full - matrix case is also shown in fig .",
    "it is interesting to point out the relatively low number of species that ultimately survive in this case , which for @xmath93 species is around @xmath94 on the average . in fig .",
    "[ f2]b we show the average number of surviving species for the full - matrix system as a function of @xmath0 .",

    ", the distribution @xmath97 for the full - matrix case will be presented later .      taking the diagonal - matrix and the full - matrix systems as limiting reference cases , we now study intermediate , more complex situations .",
    "we consider eqs .",
    "( [ sys ] ) for matrices with different numbers of nonzero diagonals .",
    "we define a @xmath98-diagonal random matrix , with @xmath98 an odd natural number , as a matrix whose elements @xmath29 vanish for @xmath99 and which are otherwise taken at random from a given distribution .",

    "the range of mean attitudes where @xmath103 is sensibly different from zero moves toward the left as @xmath98 is increased , reflecting the fact that the number of egoistic species grows . combining this observation with the results of fig .",
    "[ f3]a we conclude that the more egoistic the population is , the less the number of surviving species .    in fig .",
    "[ f3]c we show the numerical result for @xmath97 in the same realizations of fig .",
    "since in the diagonal - matrix case ( @xmath100 ) all the species survive , @xmath97 corresponds to a uniform distribution .",
    "the results for @xmath104 and @xmath105 are remarkably different .",
    "the survival probabilities are in general lower than in the diagonal - matrix case and decrease almost linearly with the mean attitude over a wide range of values of @xmath56 . near the ends of the relevant intervals the linear behavior breaks down , and @xmath97 shows abrupt maxima .",
    "the maximum on the left side of the intervals indicate that , as expected , being one of the most egoistic species is a good strategy , as far as survival is concerned .",
    "less obviously , the rightmost maximum indicates that being one of the most altruistic species is also convenient for survival .",
    "for @xmath106 , @xmath97 does not attains a maximum on the left extreme of the relevant interval and an intermediate optimum value of the mean attitude , close to @xmath107 appears , instead .    in figs .",
    "[ f4 ] and [ f5 ] we present the results for multi - diagonal matrices with their non - vanishing elements distributed uniformly on @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . in these situations ,",

    "we have kept the width of the distribution of nonzero elements equal to unity . here",
    ", we briefly analyze the effect of changing this parameter in a particular situation .",
    "we consider a @xmath113-diagonal matrix with its nonzero elements distributed uniformly in an interval of width @xmath114 around @xmath115 .",

    "multi - diagonal fitness matrices represent interaction patterns for which the ensemble of species can be ordered in a well - defined sequence , where each species interacts with a few neighbors besides the global interaction that couples the whole ecosystem .",
    "we now turn the attention to systems where the interaction pattern is more disordered than in the multi - diagonal case .",
    "we first consider fitness matrices where the diagonal elements are uniformly distributed in a certain interval , while the non - diagonal elements are drawn from the same distribution with probability @xmath116 and fixed to zero with probability @xmath117 .",

    "interacts with a relatively smaller population and its survival probability thus increases .",
    "once the fitness matrix of a population is fixed , we find that the survival probability is higher for the most extreme attitudes . in most situations , in fact , species with the lowest and largest mean attitudes i .",
    "e. , the most egoistic and the most altruistic , respectively have better chances of surviving .",
    "some remarkable exceptions have been found , however , where the egoistic extreme is not a good option , and an intermediate mean attitude maximizes the survival probability ( see fig .",
