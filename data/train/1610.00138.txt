    "<S> recently , it has been shown that thin 2d metamaterials , known as metasurfaces , whose constituent elements are optical antennas with varying resonances , can drastically alter the transmitted field by enabling spatial control of its amplitude , phase and polarization  @xcite . as a rule , </S>",

    "<S> for example , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3d we plot the @xmath85 matrix element of @xmath69 , which is seen to vary by less than an atomic linewidth over all incident angles . </S>",
    "<S> this provides an explanation for the excellent reflection of @xmath76-polarized light . for @xmath75-polarized light </S>",

    "<S> this situation can be analyzed by a straightforward extension of the above formalism . </S>",

    "<S> , the dipole array can be realized using plasmonic nano - particles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results should readily apply to this situation , provided the collective radiative decay exceeds the individual non - radiative losses , as discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> finally , 2d semiconductors such as monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides  @xcite can be used , in which excitons and trions with near lifetime limited linewidths have recently been observed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a lattice structure for the excitons ( trions ) can be created by periodically modulating strain  @xcite , varying the dielectric environment  @xcite , or by applying an external electrostatic potential . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to giving rise to the unusual dispersion relation discussed above , confining the excitons ( trions ) to sub - wavelength scales may improve their optical properties by overcoming defect - induced localization @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> any of these realizations may also be subject to _ disorder _ which may affect the cooperative resonances and scattering of the array . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we show in @xcite that the cooperative resonances are robust to fluctuations in the atomic positions when the fluctuations are much smaller than the lattice period . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we find that for small values of @xmath99 , scattering is also robust to defects such as a missing atom .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion and prospects. _ the above considerations demonstrate that the scattering properties of light at any incident polarization and detuning @xmath48 off a 2d atomic array can be controlled by choosing the lattice spacing of the array @xmath45 , enabling , for instance , its operation as a nearly perfect mirror .    </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest the potential use of such 2d arrays as powerful platforms for classical and quantum optics . while our results are obtained for a uniform atomic array , it should be possible to generalize our approach to non - homogeneous arrays , resulting in the realization of `` atomic - scale metasurfaces '' with desired properties . </S>",
    "<S> one particularly intriguing possibility is to engineer the surfaces such that a given incident mode is effectively focused on a single impurity atom . </S>",
    "<S> while even for the uniform array we find optical nonlinearities at the level of @xmath100 photons @xcite , such engineered arrays will likely display nonlinearities down to a single photon level similar to 1d systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , exceptional nonlinearities can be realized by combing the present approach with rydberg blockade and electromagnetically - induced transparency @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this work also opens up new prospects in the field of optomechanics . </S>",
    "<S> since the atoms are very light but at the same time collectively exhibit nearly perfect reflection , they form a highly mechanically - susceptible mirror , potentially very useful for the exploration of optomechanics at the quantum level @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we stress the universality of our approach for any physical system of waves and dipole - like scatterers . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our analysis of cooperative resonances is not limited to electric dipoles , and the electromagnetic green s function can be readily replaced by a green s function describing an entirely different wave phenomenon at any wavelength .    </S>",
    "<S> we thank jnos perczel for insightful comments concerning the quantum description and dispersion relation of the array . </S>",
    "<S> we also acknowledge valuable discussions with vladimir shalaev , markus greiner , peter zoller , darrick chang , hongkun park , alex high and kristiaan de greve , and financial support from nsf and the mit - harvard center for ultracold atoms .    </S>",
