    "nematic solids are principally elastomeric @xcite or glassy @xcite . in each case",
    "they are composed of nematic polymers , but either loosely or tightly crosslinked .",
    "their moduli are accordingly low or high and they are capable of either huge or modest extensions",
    ". they form unique solids in that , when their order is changed , they can change their dimensions considerably and these mechanical responses can be steered in many ways .",
    "the order can either be redirected ( director rotation under the influence of electric , mechanical or optical fields ) or reduced . in this paper , for simplicity we concentrate on changing the magnitude of order , achievable by heating or cooling , or by the absorption of light into photo - active rods when they are a component of the nematic solid .",
    "the natural elongation of the oriented polymers making up the networks is modified by order change , with the result that macroscopic mechanical changes are induced .",
    "reversible thermal strains of hundreds of per cent have been observed in elastomers @xcite .",
    "smaller changes arise in glasses , where subtle arrangements of director have been employed to achieve more complex mechanical responses @xcite . since light and heat have analogous effects , one expects and indeed finds that optical absorption leads to analogous mechanical strains , both in photo - elastomers @xcite and in photo - glasses @xcite .",
    "such a mechanism of mechanical change offers the possibility of * * m**icro-**o**pto-**m**echanical * * s**ystems ( moms ) where elements can be optically - induced to bend as elastomeric photo - swimmers @xcite or as glassy cantilevers @xcite .",
    "the bend arises because the contraction is differential with depth since the optical beam is absorbed and is hence weaker with depth . how the beam intensity varies with depth because of non - linear absorption processes , and",
    "how this variation is translated into bending even in situations where absorption is so high that penetration would be negligible in the linear case , are the two questions that concern this paper . a schematic , fig .",
    "[ fig : slender ] , of the penetration and of the differential contraction leading to bend establishes the coordinate ( @xmath0 ) of penetration , the thickness ( @xmath1 ) , and the curvature ( @xmath2 ) of the cantilever .",
    "light disrupts nematic order when molecular rods which are also chromophores , that is dye molecules , bend on absorbing a photon in their straight ( ) ground state and make an indirect transition to their bent ( ) excited state .",
    "the orientational order of tightly packed rods is thereby reduced by the fraction .",
    "we shall assume for simplicity that the mechanical contractile strain is proportional to the volume fraction .",
    "it is a vexed question as to whether heat released by these optically - induced transitions is the actual cause of the order change .",
    "this question has been addressed by irradiating polydomain nematic photo - glasses with polarized light .",
    "one finds @xcite that the mechanical contraction occurs along the light polarization direction , a response that is therefore simply tuneable by rotating the light polarization .",
    "domains closely aligned to the optical electric field absorb , and thus also contract , preferentially over domains that are misaligned @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the domain size is small , heat diffusion is fast and domains neighboring an absorbing region quickly reach similar temperatures .",
    "if temperature were the mechanism for contraction , it would thus under these conditions of fast diffusion not distinguish a preferred direction and there would be no overall effect ( just as when one simply heats a polydomain nematic solid ) .",
    "evidently , optical effects dominate .",
    "we discuss thermal effects at length in this paper and find their influence small , even across a whole monodomain cantilever , because of the diffusional rates that arise .",
    "since photons are absorbed by the dye components in the nematic , then light penetrating the face of a nematic photo - cantilever will be attenuated and hence the contractions generated diminish with depth .",
    "curvature of the cantilever results , fig .",
    "[ fig : slender ] .",
    "it is important in * * m**icro-**o**pto-**m**echanical * * s**ystems ( moms ) where elements can be optically - induced to bend as elastomeric photo - swimmers @xcite or as glassy cantilevers @xcite .",
    "weak beams decay exponentially with depth ( beer s law ) .",
    "the conversion of straight to bent ( _ trans _ @xmath3 _ cis _ ) forms of the dye molecules is also exponential in this limit . for a linear connection ( valid for small strains ) between",
    "_ cis _ population and contraction , in the beer limit maximum cantilever curvature is predicted @xcite for @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is the thickness of the cantilever and @xmath5 is the exponential decay length : if @xmath6 , only a thin skin of network contracts and its contractile stresses are insufficient to make the unstrained part of the cantilever below respond .",
    "equally , if @xmath7 , then there is little variation of photo - strain through the thickness and the cantilever may contract but not differentially with depth and thus will bend little . the extent of bend , for a fixed @xmath8 , was also predicted to be linear with intensity .",
    "experimentally , cantilevers are commonly heavily dye - doped but still show appreciable mechanical effects @xcite .",
    "the above arguments suggest that this bending is unexpected : high dye concentrations mean strong absorption and hence small @xmath5 . in this thin - skin limit , @xmath9",
    ", bend is expected to disappear .",
    "evidently non - linear effects lead to deep penetration of light and thus lead to bending .",
    "we shall explain these related effects by making two assumptions for simplicity to illustrate the underlying principles .",
    "we take the straight forward case of no photo - induced director rotation , that is for nematic glasses and constrained systems ( for instance where surface effects might be strong , where the director seems to be immobile under elongations imposed at an angle and also probably do nt rotate during photo processes @xcite .",
    "however , photoisomerisation in glasses has additional subtleties ; we derive the non - linear penetration of intense beams into glass as well .",
    "secondly we assume that there is not appreciable reduction in the magnitude of the nematic order parameter under illumination .",
    "this assumption is reasonable in glasses , but in liquid and elastomeric nematics , this assumption is too restrictive . indeed",
    "a description of polydomain nematic elastomer response invokes both order reduction and rotation @xcite .",
    "we return elsewhere to the role order reduction and rotation play in non - linear absorption and mechanics .",
    "an initial attack on this problem @xcite invoked photo - bleaching , that is depletion of the form , letting light through to greater depths than would be expected by beer s law . here",
    "we derive these non - linear effects fully , paying attention to two additional influences that are potentially important .",
    "the optically - stimulated back reaction @xmath3 can alter the non - linear processes considerably and is of importance when the absorption line is not widely separated from that of the species .",
    "secondly , thermal effects could be considerable , all the more so because of a possibly nearby nematic to isotropic transition where giant thermo - mechanical effects are known to occur , especially in elastomers .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : attenuation ] we derive equations which describe the attenuation of light passing through a region with photo - active chromophores .",
    "our analysis of non - linear absorption is thus relevant to a wide range of situations where dye is irradiated , and is not limited to mechanics , which is our ultimate aim here .",
    "our methods and results are similar to a penetrating analysis , experimental and theoretical , of statman and janossy @xcite . in section [",
    "sect : curvature ] we show how optical attenuation leads to cantilever bending and calculate the radius of curvature as a function of the incident flux of light . in section [ sec : neutrals ] we investigate the distribution of strain throughout the bent sample , and in particular we demonstrate that there can be several planes within the cantilever on which the net strain is zero . in section [ sec : temperature ]",
    "we discuss the possible effects of temperature change owing to absorption of photons on the results presented thus far .",
    "we find that , for intense illumination , temperature distributions are symmetric about the cantilever mid - plane and hence do not contribute to bend , only contraction .",
    "finally in [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider the situation of fig .",
    "[ fig : slender](b ) of a long , slender cantilever of thickness @xmath1 illuminated by light with incident flux @xmath10 .",
    "the absolute number density of chromophores is @xmath11 . at a time @xmath12 after the onset of illumination and depth @xmath0 within the cantilever , the fraction of these chromophores in the straight state is @xmath13 and the fraction in the bent state is @xmath14 .",
    "the magnitude of the poynting flux at @xmath0 and @xmath12 is @xmath15 .",
    "the dynamics of the _ trans _ fraction is determined by three processes , ( i ) an optically stimulated _ trans _",
    "@xmath3 _ cis _ reaction with rate @xmath16 , ( ii ) an optically stimulated _",
    "cis _ @xmath3 _",
    "trans _ back - reaction with rate @xmath17 and ( iii ) a spontaneous , thermally activated , _ cis _ @xmath3 _",
    "trans _ back - reaction with characteristic time @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 subsume absorption cross sections per chromophore and the quantum efficiencies @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the stimulated _ trans_-_cis _ reaction and _ cis_-_trans _ back - reaction respectively , see @xcite for the rate equations in full with such factors explicitly given .",
    "we take the absorption cross sections to be independent of nematic order  as discussed above , changing nematic order is itself another source of non - linearity .",
    "combining these three rates we obtain for the rate of change of the _ trans _ fraction : @xmath23 in this paper we confine ourselves to the steady - state , that is @xmath24 . setting this condition in eqn  ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) and taking out a factor of @xmath18 gives the steady state _",
    "trans _ and _ cis _ populations : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is now @xmath27 simply , and will be determined below .",
    "we can identify two characteristic , material intensities , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is convenient to scale the flux by its incident value , thus @xmath30 .",
    "the reduced intensity is thus @xmath31 at the entry surface @xmath32 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : slender](b ) .",
    "we also define dimensionless quantities @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "these are the incident flux reduced by fluxes @xmath35 or @xmath36 characteristic of or molecules respectively .",
    "we refer to @xmath37 and @xmath38 subsequently as reduced incident fluxes . ignoring for the moment attenuation , @xmath37 measures",
    "how much a beam intensity @xmath39 leads to conversion , eqn  ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) , by comparing @xmath39 to @xmath40 , that is the ratio of the forward rate to the thermal backward rate , @xmath41 .",
    "likewise , @xmath38 is the ratio of the induced to the thermal back rates .    in terms of the reduced incident intensities",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 , the steady state _ trans _ and _ cis _ populations are given by : @xmath42 here @xmath43 is just @xmath44 since we have the equilibrium case . in the eisenbach experiments @xcite",
    "the average conversion was @xmath45 .",
    "his measurements of attenuation suggested @xmath46 , and thus one can conclude from eqn  ( [ eq : ss ] ) that his @xmath47 . note that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are independent of chromophore concentration , but do depend on the choice of the light polarization @xcite .",
    "experimentally it is easiest to determine @xmath37 for a system dilute in chromophores , where one can ignore the complications arising when attenuation is significant . these estimates for @xmath37 are lower bounds on actual values ; including the effects of attenuation through the cantilever will lead to higher values of @xmath37 . in later work @xcite",
    "one can deduce that @xmath48 .",
    "the divergence of the poynting flux , @xmath49 , at any point through the cantilever is equal to the amount of energy taken out of the beam per unit volume per unit time . for simplicity , we ignore curvature leading to obliquity factors for the intensity of light falling on the surface .",
    "that is , we consider small deflections or diffuse light .",
    "energy is taken out of the beam both by the optically induced _ _",
    "trans__@xmath3_cis _ reaction and by the stimulated _ _",
    "cis__@xmath3_trans _ back - reaction , terms ( i ) and ( ii ) above . the divergence of the poynting flux is thus related to the sum of the rates of these two processes .",
    "thus : @xmath50 where the constant @xmath51 in each case subsumes the energy of an incident photon , @xmath52 , the reciprocal of the quantum efficiency @xmath53 for the relevant transition , and the absolute number density of chromophores , @xmath11 ( which could differ between and forms since bent molecules pack less efficiently ) .",
    "the appearance of @xmath53 as an inverse is required since for each successful transition in the rate @xmath54 ( i = t , c ) there will be unsuccessful absorptions that do not contribute to @xmath55 in ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) , but nevertheless still deplete the optical beam and contribute to @xmath56 in ( [ eq : atten ] ) .",
    "eqns  ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) and ( [ eq : atten ] ) are a pair of coupled , non - linear , first order partial differential equations for @xmath15 and @xmath13 . solving these equations subject to the boundary conditions @xmath57 and @xmath58 is in general complex , though analytically possible in some limits .",
    "we return to this problem elsewhere @xcite and here take the time - independent , equilibrium state .",
    "thus , using @xmath59 , dividing through by the incident intensity @xmath39 , and letting @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the characteristic lengths for optical attenuation by _",

    "the ratio @xmath64 is the ratio of the quantum efficiencies for the @xmath65 and @xmath66 reactions , that is @xmath67 .",
    "we shall take @xmath68 in the numerical illustrations in this paper .",
    "we have ignored any attenuation by the host material ; one could include such effects by adding a simple lambert - beer term @xmath69 to the rhs of eqn  ( [ eq : atten ] ) or eqn  ( [ eq : atten_lengths]).see section [ subsect : beerlambert ] for an analysis .    inserting the steady - state expression for @xmath70 from eqn  ( [ eq : ss ] ) into eqn  ( [ eq : atten_lengths ] ) , and then integrating w.r.t .",
    "@xmath0 , subject to @xmath71 , we obtain ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath72 where @xmath73 . in general",
    "this expression is very different from beer s law , @xmath74 .",
    "deviations from beer s law come about because at high intensities the population increases ( bleaching ) and is generally less absorbing than the species .",
    "optical penetration is then more effective and is of great significance for photo - mechanics .",
    "to most simply see how non - linearities ( bleaching ) manifest themselves , consider the limit @xmath75 @xcite that arises when stimulated back - conversion is weak ( for instance in the work of eisenbach ) . under those circumstances",
    "@xmath76 in eqn  ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) , and then ( [ eq : atten_lengths ] ) takes the form : @xmath77 a non - beer form arises because @xmath78 itself depends on @xmath43 , eqn  ( [ eq : ss ] ) .",
    "integration gives @xmath79 also a @xmath80 limit of ( [ eq : intensity ] ) .",
    "a formal solution of which is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the lambert - w function  @xcite .",
    "the non - exponential decay persists until around @xmath83 , whereupon @xmath70 becomes independent of @xmath43 and ( [ eq : atten_beta0 ] ) reverts to simple exponential form .",
    "the limiting cases of absorption are important .",
    "( i ) @xmath84 .",
    "now @xmath85 and @xmath86 which renders ( [ eq : atten_lengths ] ) trivially of the beer form .",
    "the limit obtains when @xmath87 and @xmath88 are both @xmath89 ( since @xmath43 is bounded by 1 ) , that is , the incident beam is weak compared with both material fluxes @xmath40 and @xmath90 .",
    "it also obtains when @xmath37 and @xmath38 are not small , but when @xmath91 , that is when the beam has diminished ( albeit linearly rather than exponentially , see the sketch below and also the high intensity traces of fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity0.02 ] ) to the point that @xmath92 and beer behavior is finally recovered . from ( [ eq : intensityprl ] ) one sees in fact @xmath93 $ ] for @xmath94 , a shifted beer form .",
    "exponential decay is the ultimate fate of all optical beams provided that cantilevers are thick enough to get this diminution of intensity .",
    "( ii ) the high flux limit @xmath95 ( with @xmath96 ) is where the forward reaction dominates over thermal back reaction .",
    "photo - equilibrium is highly biased away from , that is in eqn  ( [ eq : ss ] ) @xmath97 .",
    "eqn  ( [ eq : atten_beta0 ] ) reduces to @xmath98 , whence @xmath99 .",
    "this linear penetration for @xmath100 is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity0.02 ] at the higher @xmath37 values and is at the heart of why even highly absorbing systems can be responsive .",
    "when @xmath101 , decay is again exponential , see above .",
    "( iii ) the high flux limit , @xmath102 , that is @xmath103 , is where the stimulated back - reaction dominates over the thermal back - reaction . in that case @xmath104 and @xmath105 are again constants and again ( [ eq : atten ] ) takes a beer form in the equilibrium limit : d /d x = -(1+)/(d(+ ) ) .[eq : beer - larger ] the decay is exponential , @xmath106 with an effective decay length @xmath107 .",
    "thus , except for @xmath108 , profiles start in a beer - manner , have an intermediate non - exponential behavior if we have @xmath109 with @xmath110 , and then conclude with another beer decay .",
    "the intermediate regime , @xmath111 , is where the stimulated back reaction rate is comparable to the thermal rate .",
    "( iv ) when the decay lengths accidentally coincide , @xmath112 , that is @xmath113 , one can easily see in either ( [ eq : atten ] ) or in ( [ eq : atten_lengths ] ) that a beer form pertains at all intensities or depths into the photoisomerizing medium : @xmath114 .",
    "statman and janossy  @xcite investigated photo - isomerization of solutions of the commercially available azodye disperse orange ( do3 ) .",
    "they obtained a ratio of @xmath115 while the accessible range of @xmath37 is up - to @xmath116 ( corresponding to an incident flux of 15mw / mm@xmath117 ) .",
    "the spectral bands for @xmath3and @xmath3overlap quite strongly for d03 ; one might thus expect much smaller ratios of @xmath118 to be accessible when using dyes with more separated absorption bands .",
    "indeed , eisenbach s attenuation study showed that , for his systems , @xmath119 and thus that @xmath120 , possibly @xmath121 .",
    "we thus show results initially for high ratios @xmath122 for a range of incident intensities @xmath37 and then look at smaller ratios where the non - linear region is not so pronounced .    as can be seen from eqn  ( [ eq : ss ] ) ,",
    "the population is always reduced when @xmath38 is finite .",
    "thus for non - zero @xmath38 we require a larger value of @xmath37 to achieve a particular value of @xmath123 .",
    "similarly attenuation will lead to reduced intensities lower than unity in eqn  ( [ eq : ss ] ) , again requiring larger values of @xmath37 to achieve the same concentration .",
    "thus estimates of @xmath37 from absorption are lower bounds on true values .",
    "we recall the case in which the illuminating light does nt excite the @xmath3back - reaction at all , i.e. @xmath125 . thus the intensity is described by eqn  ( [ eq : intensityprl ] ) .",
    "plots are given in @xcite , but fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity0.02 ] for the case @xmath126 of relatively small @xmath38 also shows how for low @xmath37 the decay from the surface intensity is exponential , but that penetration is much deeper for higher @xmath37 , being initially a linear decay until finally decaying as an off - set exponential beyond the characteristic depth @xmath127 , that is for @xmath94 .",
    "such non - exponential behavior suggests caution when trying to establish an extinction length from the attenuation of a light beam on traversing a cantilever .",
    "for instance @xcite an attenuation of 99% on traversing a cantilever of thickness @xmath128 m , were beer s law being followed , would result from an extinction length of @xmath129m@xmath130 .",
    "but if @xmath37 is not small , much more light penetrates to @xmath131 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity0.02 ] is a guide ) .",
    "the @xmath132 value derived is a gross over - estimate of @xmath127 . solving for @xmath127 from eqn  ( [ eq : intensityprl ] ) for a given attenuation @xmath133 on reaching the back face at @xmath134 yields for 99% attenuation : @xmath135 for @xmath136 .",
    "the true @xmath127 associated with a possible exponential decay may thus be much lower than the value @xmath132 estimated as above , an indication that light has penetrated much further into the sample than would be expected for a simple exponential profile .",
    "quantitative measurements of light attenuation varying with thickness or varying with incident intensity would resolve this ambiguity about @xmath127 and also allow a determination of @xmath37 .",
    "attenuation at one thickness can only give an upper bound on @xmath127 .",
    "the reasons for departures from beer s law for the intensity can be seen by returning the solution @xmath44 to eqn  ( [ eq : ss ] ) to obtain the spatial variation of the _ cis _ concentration .",
    "[ fig : cis0.02 ] for the case @xmath126 is a guide to the @xmath137 plots ( see @xcite ) and displays exponential decay in @xmath138 following @xmath44 for low intensity ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "high incident intensity not only lifts @xmath140 at the surface , but also flattens the decay with depth ",

    "a point of inflection first appears at the surface , and moves inwards with increasing incident intensity @xmath37 .",
    "the _ cis _ fraction at the inflection is always @xmath144 in this model . in the general case where @xmath145 we find that the value of @xmath37 at which the point of inflection first appears at the front surface is a complicated function of the constant ratio @xmath118 , and the value of the fraction at the inflection point is no longer @xmath146 . from eqn  ( [ eq : ss ] ) , the surface _",

    "the precise form of the cantilever bend depends critically on the shape of these @xmath138 curves .",
    "in particular the development of a point of inflection allows three intercepts of the straight , geometric strain curves , and thus three neutral surfaces , we will later see .",
    "since @xmath138 changes shape with increasing intensity , we will find an elastic response that is highly non - linear with intensity .",
    "we now consider the case with a weakly stimulated back - reaction , @xmath150 , and henceforth take @xmath68 .",
    "fig  [ fig : intensity0.02 ] shows plots of the reduced intensity as a function of @xmath151 .",
    "the reduced intensity curves are largely identical to the @xmath137 case . once again , for small values of @xmath37 ( = 0.1 , 0.5 ) the decay is essentially exponential , with a characteristic length given by @xmath127 .",

    "eventually @xmath44 becomes exponential at penetration depths @xmath153 significantly greater than @xmath127 .    as we show above , for @xmath154 , that is here @xmath155 , the initial behavior should ( briefly ) revert to being exponential before attaining the linear decay associated with non - beer .",

    "the profiles as a function of depth are shown in fig  [ fig : cis0.02 ] .",
    "for the values of @xmath37 plotted , the curves are essentially identical to those in the @xmath137 case .",
    "high incident intensities result in larger fractions near the surface , and a flatter decay as before .",
    "the point of inflection occurs for a fraction less than the 1/3 found in the @xmath137 case , but it is still of importance that inflections exist for the character and number of neutral surfaces we explore later .",
    "increasing the stimulated back reaction further we take @xmath156 .",
    "the curves for the reduced intensity as a function of depth , see fig  [ fig : intensity0.2 ] , now differ somewhat from those in the small @xmath38 limit , e.g. as in fig  [ fig : intensity0.02 ] . for the smaller values of @xmath37",
    "the curves remain exponential with a characteristic length @xmath127 .",
    "increasing @xmath37 leads to some increased penetration , without showing the long linear decay in reduced intensity seen in fig  [ fig : intensity0.02 ] .",

    "at least two other influences are important in non - linear absorption . how does one deal with the absorption of the host material that is not a chromophore . in principle",
    "this is the simplest form of absorption and for weak beams where both processes are beer - like the effect can simply be divided out . we examine how this procedure translates to the non - linear case .",

    "for simplicity ignoring the backreaction , @xmath137 , the absorption equation ( [ eq : atten_lengths ] ) becomes @xmath164 the absorption length @xmath127 of course emerges naturally by measuring the absorption of a sample without dye , @xmath165 .",
    "using @xmath166 , and denoting the ratio of absorption lengths @xmath167 , integration yields : @xmath168 where the effective absorption length is @xmath169 . the relation ( [ eq : profile - bg ] ) for @xmath170 has close similarities to that for the profile with a back reaction , eqn  ( [ eq : intensity ] ) .",
    "the limit @xmath171 of eqn  ( [ eq : profile - bg ] ) of no host absorption leads to the previous lambert - w expression given below eqn  ( [ eq : intensityprl ] ) . in the conclusions we discuss how host absorption can be allowed for in measurements .",
    "the role of the host has been much studied in dynamical studies of absorption .",
    "when the host , typically a polymer or a network , is below the glass temperature then it is observed that there is more than one characteristic decay time for the population of guest chromophores .",
    "eisenbach @xcite clearly observed two times , the relative weight of the processes being dependent upon temperature .",
    "the slower process was analogous to that observed in a liquid host and becomes the only process present at elevated temperatures .",
    "the faster process was speculated to arise from the strained state of a isomer ; a fraction of the molecules when in a bent state are in conflict with the solid matrix around them and thereby decay more quickly to the form .",
    "other authors @xcite suggest that there is a spectrum of relaxation times corresponding to a range of environments that chromophores find themselves in .",

    "since the thermally - induced strains are also symmetric , they will not produce bending , although once again they will produce an overall contraction .",
    "if the cantilever thickness @xmath1 is increased beyond the linear profile interval in e.g. fig  [ fig : intensity0.02 ] , then asymmetry in the heat production starts to occur , with less heat generated towards the back face .",
    "however , the magnitude of the asymmetry is reduced by diffusion and the thermal contribution to bend sets in only slowly with increasing @xmath1 , see ( i ) above .",
    "the neglect of heat is thus justified in two limits , firstly the convective heat losses from the boundary are likely to result in a uniform temperature distribution through the sample for experimentally realistic values of the thermal conductivity @xmath256 and the convective heat transfer co - efficient @xmath266 .",
    "further , in the regime of linear ( i.e. non - exponential ) decay of intense beams there is no thermal component of bend .",
    "thermal effects become more extreme , especially in elastomers , if an interior region of the cantilever s temperature exceeds the nematic - isotropic transition temperature . at this temperature",
    "an extremely large strain can develop in elastomers , and possibly in glasses .",
    "if it occurs in a region symmetrically disposed about the cantilever mid plane , it could lead to pronounced contractions , but still not to bend .",
    "if it occurs in an asymmetrically disposed region , it could lead to large bends  an extreme case we return to in considering specifically elastomers and thus at the same time considering director rotation .",
    "additionally one would there consider the displacement of neutral planes due to volumes of the cantilever suffering large contractions of their natural lengths .",
    "we have shown that non - linear absorption ( that is , non - exponential profiles ) can be invoked to explain how bending can arise in cantilevers where , within beer s law , one would otherwise expect no response . at high enough incident",
    "light intensities , there can be photo - bleaching and thereby penetration of radiation and thus elastic response even in cantilevers so heavily loaded with dye that the beer penetration depth of the linear regime is insignificant compared with the cantilever s thickness .",

    "altering the incident intensity is equivalent to varying the parameter @xmath37 . taking a fixed depth ( the thickness itself ) @xmath203 in fig  [ fig : intensity0.02 ] and [ fig : intensity0.2 ] and increasing reduced incident power",
