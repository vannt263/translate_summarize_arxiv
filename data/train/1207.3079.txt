    "among the central questions in galactic structure and parameters are the solar motion , solar galactocentric radius @xmath13 and the local circular velocity @xmath2 of our galaxy .",
    "galactic rotation curves are found to be generally quite flat over a vast range of galactocentric radii @xcite . as common for galaxies with exponential discs",
    "there is some evidence for a radial trend of the galactic circular velocity near the sun , but it is very moderate @xcite , so that the circular velocity at solar galactocentric radius @xmath0 characterises well the entire potential .    initially local kinematic data from stellar samples were the main source to extract galactic parameters including @xmath2 , e.g. by the use of the oort constants @xcite .",
    "the kinematic heat of stellar populations requires large sample sizes , so that studies determining the local standard of rest ( lsr ) are still primarily based on stars , but some classical strategies like the position determination of the galactic centre pioneered by @xcite reached their limits by the constraints from geometric parallaxes , by the number of available luminous standard candles , and by the magnitude requirements of stellar spectroscopy .",
    "apart from some more recent attempts to use luminous stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most current evidence on @xmath0 and @xmath2 derives from modelling streams in the galactic halo ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from radio observations of the @xmath14 terminal velocity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the galactic centre , molecular clouds and masers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while the first branch relies strongly on assumptions such as distance scale and shape of the galactic potential ( cf .",
    "the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there are further complications like the failure of tidal streams to delineate stellar orbits @xcite .",
    "radio observations @xcite have accurately determined the proper motion of the radio source sgr @xmath15 , which is identified with the central black hole of the milky way ( for a discussion of possible uncertainties see also * ? ? ?",
    "it tightly constrains the ratio of the solar speed in the azimuthal direction @xmath1 to @xmath0 , but further information is required to obtain both quantities , letting aside the need for an independent measurement .",
    "recently parallaxes to objects in the central galactic regions have become available ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and values for the galactic circular speed have been derived from @xmath14 motions and from masers @xcite . despite the decent errors in the determined kinematics of masers , the small sample sizes impose considerable systematic uncertainties : they are not on pure circular orbits and more importantly they are intimately connected to the intense star formation in spiral arms , where the kinematic distortions are largest . as the youngest strategy ,",
    "studies of orbits in the galactic centre have gained high precision , but weakly constrain @xmath13 due to a strong degeneracy with the black hole mass @xcite .",
    "hence the values for @xmath0 and @xmath1 remain under debate .",
    "an independent determination of galactic parameters is facilitated by the new large spectroscopic surveys like rave @xcite and segue @xcite .",
    "i will show that already now the stellar samples , which so far have been primarily used for the exploration of substructure @xcite give results for @xmath2 competitive with radio observations .",
    "common ways to determine galactic parameters from the motion of stars require a significant bundle of assumptions and modelling efforts to evaluate the asymmetric drift in a subpopulation compared to the velocity dispersion and other measurements and assumptions , e.g. detailed angular momentum and energy distributions , the validity of the theoretical approximations , etc . on the contrary",
    "a good measurement strategy for galactic parameters should have the following properties :    * do not rely on dispersions and other quantities that require accurate knowledge of measurement errors . * do not rely on kinematically cold objects in the disc plane , which are particularly prone to perturbations from galactic structure . * do not rely on any specific models with hidden assumptions and parameters and require as few assumptions as possible .    in an attempt to approximate these conditions",
    "this note concentrates on the use of kinematically hot ( thick disc , halo ) populations .",
    "the use of mean motions and the assumption of approximate axisymmetry in our galaxy will be sufficient to fix the galactocentric radius of the sun as well as the solar motion and galactic circular speed .    in section [ sec : p7general ]",
    "i lay out the general method before describing the sample selection and treatment in section [ sec : p7sample ] .",
    "the latter comprises a discussion of proper motion systematics , a discussion of distances in subsection [ sec : p7dist ] and a discussion of line - of - sight velocities and the vertical motion of the sun . in section [ sec : p7globrot ]",
    "i lay out the radial velocity based rotation measurement using segue , discuss the radial velocity of the sun in subsection [ sec : p7lsr ] and shortly discuss possible trends . from [ sec : p7galparam ] on i present three methods to to extract galactic parameters from stellar samples , the first two methods relying on the radial velocity based rotation measurement and the third on the mean direction of stellar motions . in section [ sec : p7conclude ] i summarise the results .",
    "before i start the dirty work of data analysis it seems appropriate to concisely lay out the general definitions and ideas .      this work is based on comparisons between velocities in the heliocentric frame and galactocentric velocities . in the heliocentric frame",
    "i define the velocities @xmath16 in a cartesian coordinate system as the components pointing at the sun towards the galactic centre , in the direction of rotation and vertically towards the galactic north pole .",
    "the galactocentric velocities are defined in cylindrical coordinates around the galactic centre with @xmath17 pointing again towards the galactic central axis , in the direction of rotation and vertically out of the plane , as illustrated in .",
    "@xmath18 are the three components of the solar motion relative to the local standard of rest ( i.e. the circular orbit at the local galactocentric radius @xmath13 ) , for which i assume the values from @xcite if not stated otherwise .",
    "the total azimuthal velocity of the sun in the galactic frame is written @xmath19 where @xmath2 denotes the circular velocity in the disc plane of the milky way at @xmath13 .",
    "the mean rotation speed of a subsample of stars will be named @xmath4 and by the asymmetric drift is generally smaller than @xmath2 . for convenience",
    "local cartesian coordinates are defined left - handed @xmath20 pointing outwards , in the direction of rotation and upwards with the sun at the origin .",
    "commonly studies on the rotation of galactic components suffer from the uncertainty in the solar azimuthal velocity that directly translates into a systematic uncertainty of stellar azimuthal velocities .",
    "there is a way out : as already discussed in @xcite and evident from , galactic rotation leaves its imprint in both the heliocentric @xmath3 and @xmath21 velocities .",
    "the direction of the rotational component of motion @xmath22 turns with the angle @xmath10 between the lines galactic centre  sun and galactic centre ",
    "star to align partly with the radial component @xmath3 of the local cartesian frame . from this systematic streaming motion in heliocentric @xmath3 velocities",
    "we can directly infer the galactic rotation of a stellar sample .",
    "accounting for rotation the mean motions of stars in the heliocentric frame are : @xmath23 with the rotation speed of the population @xmath4 and the galactic angle @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath24 are the velocity components of the solar motion in the galactic rest frame radially towards the galactic centre , azimuthally in the direction of disc rotation and vertically out of the plane . observing the change of heliocentric @xmath3 velocity in a sufficiently extended sample hence estimates the rotation of a component @xmath4 , once we know the angle @xmath10 .",
    "similarly the observed heliocentric azimuthal velocity @xmath21 shrinks towards larger @xmath25 .",
    "prima facie it might be tempting to use this term . yet , all it expresses is a slowing of heliocentric azimuthal velocities . in general @xmath4 is not a real constant , but a function of altitude @xmath26 , galactocentric radius @xmath27 , metallicities , etc .",
    "in particular the kinematically hotter disc populations at higher altitudes above the plane have a larger asymmetric drift ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or vice versa slower rotation , seconded by an increase in the share of the nearly non - rotating halo . pointing out from the sun s position in the mid - plane , @xmath28 correlates via the typical distance range with altitude @xmath26 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath3 , where this bias is of second order , it is of first order in @xmath21 and prohibits any naive estimate of @xmath4 from azimuthal velocities .",
    "a similar uncertainty derives from the possibility for variations of @xmath4 in @xmath27 even at the same altitude .",
    "the radial velocities are better behaved .",
    "sample changes along the baseline @xmath29 are not only a second order effect , but are generally more robust : the greatest concern is a bias in the derived @xmath9 , which can be prevented by fixing its value by previous knowledge or by simply having a sufficient sky coverage that allows to balance both sides of the galactic centre and includes sufficient numbers of stars at low @xmath25 .",
    "if the integrity of @xmath9 is ensured , sample changes along the baseline just result in different statistical weights of the involved populations .",
    "the value @xmath4 derived from heliocentric radial motions is by construction independent from the assumed solar azimuthal velocity and ( in an extended sample ) is only weakly impacted by ( if held fixed ) a mis - estimate of @xmath9 .",
    "this contrasts to direct measurements of @xmath22 that rely fully on the total solar azimuthal velocity @xmath1 - a short - come now turning into a virtue : @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be varied to force an agreement between the rotation estimates from @xmath4 and @xmath22 .",
    "as the position - dependent statistical weights in @xmath4 are known , one can estimate a weighted average of @xmath22 exactly on these weights .",
    "the sole assumption of approximate axisymmetry of the galactic disc ( but not necessarily in the sample selection ) is then sufficient to compare @xmath4 and @xmath22 and measure galactic parameters without the least concern about sample selection , velocity trends , etc .",
    "the comparison gives a relation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , which can be combined with independent data like the proper motion of sgr @xmath15 to provide a superior estimate of galactic parameters .",
    "however , @xmath0 alone can be measured with this simple method alone , as @xmath4 is roughly proportional to @xmath0 ( see section [ sec : p7galparam ] or ) , so that any error in @xmath0 shears the estimate of @xmath1 for fast rotating populations against their slower counterparts .",
    "any reader not interested into the details of sample selection , distance analysis and the proper motions may skip this section and turn directly towards section [ sec : p7lsr ] .",
    "all data used in this study were taken from the seventh and eighth data release ( hereafter dr7 and dr8 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the stellar spectra stem from the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue , * ?",
    "an evaluation of the performance of their parameter pipeline ( sspp ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "this work has no interest in specific metallicity distributions , but in having kinematically unbiased samples that include as many stars as possible .",
    "hence the sample drawn from dr8 consists of a raw dataset of @xmath30 stars from all segue target categories and the photometric and reddening standard stars that do not include any proper motion cuts and have clean photometry .",
    "in particular i use the categories of f turnoff / sub - dwarf , low metallicity , f / g , g dwarf , k dwarf , m sub - dwarf stars from segue1 , as well as ms turnoff , low metallicity and the reddening and photometric standard stars from all samples .",
    "the categories were selected by the target bitmasks of the database .",
    "some of these categories overlap with kinematically biased selections and the survey descriptions are not clear about a possibility of direct ( cross - selection of stars ) or indirect ( non - selection of stars that are targeted in a biased category ) bias .",
    "i made sure that the presented results are unchanged when selecting stars by the unique target flags in the sspp . also checks on leaving out e.g.",
    "k dwarfs that might overlap with the biased k giants did not provide evidence for a notable bias by the segue target selection .",
    "the older dr7 forms a subset of @xmath31 stars .    to ensure sufficient quality of the involved proper motions , i select only stars with a match in the proper motion identifications ( @xmath32 ) , the presence of at least @xmath33 detections ( @xmath34 ) and a good position determination with @xmath35 as a compromise between @xcite and currently used selection schemes .",
    "i further require the formal errors on the proper motions to fulfil @xmath36 , removing the tail of uncertain proper motion determinations and require line - of - sight velocity errors below @xmath37 .",
    "sample homogeneity is not a concern in this study , but to avoid issues with reliability of the isochrones in colour regions with insufficient coverage to check them by statistics , i select @xmath38 , which tosses out a handful of stars especially on the red side .",
    "i tested that narrower colour cuts would have no significant effect on the presented results .    for our purpose",
    "it is most important to have a good discrimination between dwarf stars and other categories and to dispose of as many evolved stars above the main sequence as possible .",
    "hence only stars are used that have values for gravity and metallicity determined by the pipeline .",
    "the sample must be restricted to dwarf stars , as @xcite showed that stars with intermediate gravities in the pipeline are an indeterminable blend of dwarf , subgiant and giant stars , which renders their distance scatter and residual biases detrimental to any investigation of their kinematics .",
    "following @xcite i adopt a sloping gravity cut generally tighter than the usually applied @xmath39 , demanding @xmath40 and setting a constant limit of @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "it is important to point out that this selection could especially on the metal - poor end still be irresponsibly lenient for studies of detailed stellar kinematics , as it will comprise a serious contamination with misidentified ( sub-)giants and does not bias sufficiently against the brighter turn - off stars . indeed",
    "the distance corrections described below react to a tighter gravity cut in the metal - poor regime by up to @xmath45 . relying only in mean velocities the preference in this work",
    "is leaned towards larger sample numbers and for assurance i checked that a tighter selection widens the error margins , but does not alter my results .    quite frequently studies on segue use a cut in the signal to noise ratio @xmath46 to ensure reasonable parameters .",
    "since the determination of stellar parameters is difficult in those noisy spectra , the detection of a mild drift in the derived quantities towards higher @xmath47 does not surprise , motivating a cut at @xmath48 where results become more stable .",
    "de - reddening is done by subtraction of the reddening vectors given in the dr8 catalogue from the observed magnitudes . to limit uncertainties and avoid problems with complicated three dimensional behaviour of the reddening ,",
    "i remove all objects with an estimated @xmath49 magnitude extinction @xmath50 .",
    "this strips all stars in the low latitude fields from the sample .",
    "i tested that the exclusion does not have a significant impact on my results apart from mildly increasing the derived formal errors , but maintain this cut for the sake of sample purity .",
    "i exclude all stars flagged for spectral anomalies apart from suspected carbon enhancement .",
    "the internal consistency of the distance estimator against closer distance bins starts eroding for @xmath51 .",
    "hence i use this distance limit instead of the more common @xmath52 .      for a precise measurement of galactic rotation",
    "i am reliant on a decent control of systematic errors on proper motions .",
    "unbiased noise is of no concern as proper motion errors translate linearly into velocities ( see equ . 20 in",
    "* ) and hence mean velocities ( on which this paper relies ) are only affected by the mean value of proper motion errors . after a short description of proper motion systematics i will measure them in equatorial coordinates in section [ sec : p7pmeq ] and develop terms that are more natural to a contamination problem and galactic rotation in section [ sec : p7pmgal ] .",
    "@xcite reported significant problems with the dr8 astrometry implying also problems with proper motions .",
    "fortunately the revised astrometry has become available during refereeing stage of this paper and i will exclusively use the new data .",
    "it should be noted that also dr7 had major problems , e.g. the entire @xmath53 @xmath54 was clearly erroneous / contaminated with large effects on kinematics .",
    "its @xmath55 share of the total sample would bring down my later measurement of galactic rotation by as much as @xmath56 .",
    "most problems with sloan proper motions have been adressed in the revised astrometry , but the large impact calls for an investigation of residual biases .",
    "two main sources of systematic terms can be identified : astrometric `` frame - dragging '' and chromatic aberrations . despite the efforts to clean up the galaxy sample used for astrometry from residual contamination with galactic stars , the sample may still be subject to some astrometric `` frame - dragging '' . qualitatively those stars shift the frames in the direction of galactic rotation or respectively their motion relative to the sun , underestimating the real motion in the sample . as an alternative explanation @xcite traced the significant declination dependent net proper motions on quasars back to chromatic aberration by earth s atmosphere @xcite : the angle at which the stellar light passes through our atmosphere strongly depends on the declination and this should give rise to colour - dependent offsets .",
    "further , deformations in the telescope can introduce minor distortions of the focal plane .",
    "l|ccc & @xmath57 _ ra & @xmath57 _ dec & @xmath58 + f_i , ra 10 ^ 3 & @xmath59 & 0.18 & 0.16 + f_i , dec10 ^ 3 & -0.59 & @xmath60 & 0.50 + c_i & @xmath61 & @xmath62 & 0.033      while the existence of these aberrations appears plausible , i tested proper motions on the cleaner @xcite quasar sample .",
    "i fitted a simple linear function in right ascension and declination to the proper motions from the revised dr8 astronomy : @xmath63[eq : p7radec ] where @xmath64 denotes the two possible proper motion components in right ascension ( ra ) and declination ( dec ) , @xmath65 are the coefficients , @xmath66 are free fitting constants . using the combined fit diminishes the impact from omitted variable bias that might arise from the particular sample geometry ( the explaining variables are mildly correlated ) .",
    "the fit parameters are shown in table [ tab : qparradec ] .",
    "there is a clear and significant detection of systematic proper motions of order @xmath67 .",
    "i also checked the same fit on the older dr8 astrometry , where the derived terms were even slightly smaller .",
    "the large term on @xmath68 can be expected from chromatic aberration . however , the strong effect on the right ascension is more difficult to explain by atmospheric influences , but may still come from specific distortions on the telescope or if the observations were made in a very particular manner that correlates the airmass of a stellar observation significantly to right ascension .",
    "the sample size of just about @xmath69 quasars limits the possibility to dissect into subgroups .",
    "however , cutting in observed colours there is no detectable difference between quasars at @xmath70 and @xmath71 implying that in the colour range interesting for the stellar sample the bias is quite consistent .",
    "derived values go only adrift for @xmath72 , which bears no importance to the stellar sample .",
    "the strong deviations on the right ascension motivate tests for astrometric `` frame '' dragging by stellar contamination . in the following",
    "i develop a very crude analytic approximation for a proper motion bias in the @xmath73-plane as it could arise from galactic streaming - note also that this toy is not used in any other way throughout the paper apart from the proper motion corrections : candidates for contamination of the galaxy sample should preferentially populate a certain magnitude range and also have preferred colours resembling the galaxies used .",
    "it hence seems appropriate to assume for simplification some dominant distance for stars contaminating the sample , placed at @xmath74 .",
    "the outcomes will anyway not be critically affected by this distance ( which can alter the shape of the systematic bias once the stars are sufficiently remote for the small angle approximation to break down ) . on this shell",
    "i assume the stars to rotate dependent on their altitude @xmath26 around the galactic centre with @xmath75 .",
    "the proper motion can be written down from the heliocentric velocities from equation ( [ eq : p7rot ] ) subtracting the reflex motions of the solar local standard of rest ( lsr ) values from @xcite and assuming a total solar azimuthal velocity according to the iau recommendations at @xmath76 . using this the simple galactic streaming terms are : @xmath77 with @xmath78 where @xmath79 does the unit conversion , @xmath3 and @xmath21 are the heliocentric velocities from streaming minus the assumed motion of the sun and @xmath80 are the fit parameters .",
    "the terms connected to @xmath81 give a crude estimate for the effects from halo streaming .",
    ".fit parameters for systematic streaming in the quasar proper motions in dr8 with and without cut for @xmath82 as described in the text .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the derived values for dr8 are presented in table [ tab : qpar ] .",
    "the old , erroneous dr8 and dr7 produce similar results . slicing the sample in colour i could not detect any significant changes , just the bluemost @xmath83 of the quasars appear to be different .",
    "still , cutting for @xmath82 does not evoke notable consequences @xmath83 , as well as removing the @xmath45 of objects with the largest proper motions does not have any impact .",
    "the coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath81 may be understood roughly as contamination fractions , but not on accurate terms because the distance dependence of proper motions effects a strong dependence of the fractions on the assumed distance of stellar contaminants .",
    "the sign in the expected trends is not predictable a priori , as the @xcite sample may harbour itself some residual stellar contamination that competes with possible astrometry problems . in both cases the main rotation term",
    "@xmath84 is significantly negative hinting to some more misclassified stars affecting astrometry as compared to the quasar sample . on the other hand the coefficients @xmath81 that resemble terms expected for the galactic halo",
    "are slightly positive , which might be interpreted as a tiny surplus of halo stars hiding in the quasar sample .",
    "i rather understand it as an omitted variable bias : neither do i know the exact functional shapes and distance distributions of the contamination , nor do i have precise terms at hand to cope with the possible chromatic aberrations .",
    "exact terms for contamination would demand a complete modelling of the entire measurement process including a reasonable model to the milky way , other galaxies and the exact sloan selection function .",
    "if i fit alone either @xmath81 or @xmath84 , both variables turn out negative and still their counterparts are negative when i fit them with this naively derived value .",
    "so one could argue that @xmath84 is getting excessively negative being balanced by a slightly positive @xmath81 to cope with these uncertainties .    in the end",
    "i can not achieve more than a rather phenomenological correction without being able to determine the true cause for the observed trends .",
    "the naive approximation still fulfils its purpose to parametrise the influence on galactic rotation measurements . throughout the following paper",
    "i will use the terms for @xmath85 to correct stelar proper motions independent of colour , since no significant colour dependence was detected .    for proper motion errors ,",
    "which influence the distance determinations , i use the pipeline values and checked that using the values from @xcite for dr7 instead does not significantly affect the presented analysis .      in this work",
    "i make use of the statistical distance correction method developed by @xcite .",
    "the approach relies on the velocity correlations over galactic angles that are induced by systematic distance errors and entails a better precision and robustness than classical methods .",
    "the method can find the average distance in any sample of a couple of hundred stars .",
    "the only thing required as first input is a smooth distance or respectively absolute magnitude calibration that has a roughly correct shape in parameters like colours and metallicity .",
    "the shape has some importance as erroneous assumptions would result in an increased distance scatter on the sample bins and thus in residual systematic trends for different subpopulations .",
    "the use of statistical distance corrections is mandatory as there are in all cases expected offsets by reddening uncertainties , age uncertainties , the uncertain binary fraction , mild differences by evolutionary differences on the main sequence , systematic metallicity offsets and by the helium enhancement problem , where the isochrones appear to be too faint at a fixed colour .",
    "primary stellar distances are derived from a dense grid of basti isochrones @xcite that was kindly computed by s. cassisi for the purpose of our age determinations in @xcite .",
    "i use the @xmath86 isochrones which seems an appropriate compromise between the suspected age of the first disc populations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the age of halo stars . for metal - poor stars with @xmath87",
    "i account for alpha enhancement by raising the effective @xmath88 by @xmath89 as suggested by @xcite or @xcite . in analogy to the observations of @xcite i let the alpha enhancement go linearly to zero towards solar metallicity : @xmath90    some of the stars are located bluewards of the turn - off point at this age . to cope with these objects , i search the point at which the old isochrone is @xmath91 brighter than the corresponding @xmath92 isochrone and extrapolate bluewards parallel to the main sequence defined by the @xmath92 isochrones .",
    "i also experimented with using the turnoff point , i.e. the blue - most point of the old isochrone , but this introduces larger shot noise in distances that would hamper the distance corrections via the method of @xcite . comparing the expected @xmath93-band absolute magnitude of each star to the measured reddening corrected @xmath94 ,",
    "i then infer its expected distance modulus and hence distance @xmath95 .      to derive a correction field , i bin the sample in metallicity and @xmath96 colour .",
    "i also attempted binning the sample simultaneously in distance as well , but found no additional benefits , probably because the bulk of the sample is further away than @xmath97 .",
    "i also excluded high reddening regions so that variations of reddening with distance are comparatively small .",
    "there is a trade - off between resolution of the smallest possible structures in the correction field and the introduction of poisson noise by lower effective numbers of stars contributing to the estimate at a certain point in the observed space .",
    "the strategy is to select every 30th star in the sample and estimate the distance shift for its 700 closest neighbours ( i checked that the bin size has no significant effect ) using an euclidean metric on the parameter space : @xmath98 for non - halo or respectively metal - rich stars , which offer less accurate statistics by their smaller heliocentric velocities , this results in some significant scatter , which is reduced by smoothing the distance corrections via a weighted logarithmic mean : @xmath99 where @xmath95 is the a priori distance estimate from isochrone interpolation .",
    "the first sum runs over all stellar parameter sets @xmath100 around which the best - fit distance correction @xmath101 or respectively the distance mis - estimate factor @xmath65 has been evaluated . the second index @xmath102 runs over used parameters ( here metallicity and colour ) , to evaluate the parameter differences @xmath103 between the star in question and the mean values of all evaluation subsets and smooth via the exponential kernel with the smoothing lengths @xmath104 .",
    "i chose @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "when binning the sample a second time for measuring galactic parameters , i fit the distance for a second time to diminish the danger of remaining systematic biases .",
    "anyway there is no evident trend , e.g. with distance , in the second step and the remaining corrections are on the noise level .",
    "@xcite showed that in the presence of significant intrinsic distance scatter the method a slight mean distance underestimate occurs , which is caused by stars with distance overestimates populating the edges of the fitting baseline and hence acquiring larger weight .",
    "this bias was found at @xmath107 , where @xmath65 denotes the relative distance error and @xmath108 its variance .",
    "i confirmed the validity of the prefactor @xmath109 for the sample in use by applying a range of gaussian broadenings to the first guess isochrone distances .",
    "though the prefactor is known , it is not straight forward to estimate the values of @xmath110 dependent on metallicity and colour . on the red side",
    "the stars are relatively firmly placed on the main sequence , the reddening vector runs quite parallel to the main sequence , and hence the colour and metallicity errors dominate justifying a moderate error estimate @xmath111 . on the blue",
    "end the placement of the stars on the turn - off becomes increasingly uncertain and especially on the metal - rich side one must expect significant spread in ages and hence absolute magnitudes as well .",
    "i hence adopt a mild increase in distance depending on colour @xmath112    which is larger on the blue side and increases mildly with metallicity .",
    "i limit the relative distance increase to a maximum of @xmath113 , which corresponds to a distance scatter @xmath114 .",
    "shows the finally adopted absolute magnitudes ( upper panel ) and the correction field for the isochrone distances ( lower panel ) in the colour - metallicity plane . along the blue metal - poor stars i require moderate distance stretching",
    "this is the turn  off region , where the @xmath86 isochrones might be a little bit too young and get shifted upwards in addition to the known suspicion of isochrones being too faint . on the other hand a bit of contamination by subgiants",
    "is more likely because of the reduced difference in surface gravity and weaker absorption lines .",
    "the problems with gravities for the most metal - poor stars are indicated by the absolute magnitudes bending back , i.e. the most metal - poor stars being made brighter again at the same colour .",
    "carbon stars constitute another bias having stronger absorption in the g - band , making them too `` red '' in the colour assignment , which brings forth a brightness underestimate .",
    "in principle the method explores the structure around the turn  off and the dominant ages among these populations , but owing to the scope of this work i defer this to a later paper . at higher metallicities the turn  off line evidently bends upwards , i.e. to redder colours as expected from stellar models . on the other hand",
    "there is evidence for a younger metal - rich population at blue colours , indicated by the absence of distance under - estimates contrasting with their metal - poor antipodes .",
    "some vertically aligned features might point to minor systematics in the pipeline metallicities ( e.g. under - estimating a star s metallicity makes us underestimate its distance ) .",
    "the little spike near the turn - off around @xmath115 could be an unlucky statistical fluctuation .",
    "if it was real and not caused by a problem in the pipeline it would indicate a rather sharp transition in ages with relatively young stars at slightly higher metallicities opposing the very old population in the halo regime . throughout the range of g and k",
    "dwarfs there is a quite constant need for mildly larger distances than envisaged by naive use of the stellar models .    to test my approach for consistency ,",
    "i experimented with the @xcite ( a7 ) relation as well and found that as expected the distance corrections robustly produce an almost identical final outcome despite the highly different input .",

    "it is tempting to argue in accordance with @xcite that all those trends are reaction of the galactic disc to some satellite interaction , but such reasoning is contradicted by more of the signal coming from the halo stars , which can not participate in such a response .",
    "an explanation by streams conflicts with the broad metallicity range concerned that would require a conspiracy of nature",
    ". a simpler explanation might be a warp in the disc , but again this conflicts with the metallicity trend .",
    "the easiest explanation for the deviation is a residual error in the pipeline . to avail this and stay as close as possible to the pipeline values , i use henceforth a minimal correction that keeps the discussed trend just below significance : @xmath132 allowing the corrections to vary between @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",

    "i evaluate the mean motion in the heliocentric frame ( left panel ) and the mean motion in the galactocentric frame ( right ) .",
    "while i would expect some minor systematic motion even in the galactocentric frame by spiral structure and maybe influence by the bar , such contributions will be relatively small as most of this sample is at high altitudes , where the stars with their large random velocities experience less important changes of motion by the relatively shallow potential troughs of the spiral pattern .",
    "some of the residual structure will likely be blurred out by poisson noise and distance uncertainties , so that it is no surprise not to see any appreciable signal . as a good sign",
    "there are no direction - dependent shifts , which would be expected under systematic distance errors , which make especially the azimuthal velocity component cross over into the radial velocity determinations . in the left panel",
    ", however , we see the very prominent rotational streaming of the galactic disc , which is central to the following investigations .",
    "the strong influence of rotational streaming on the observed radial motion makes any determination unreliable that does not explicitly take it into account .",
    "before i turn to its positive application , i lay out a simple procedure to deal with this effect as a contaminant and measure the solar radial lsr velocity . in the literature varying offsets of the solar radial motion of up to more than @xmath11 from the value derived from local samples have been claimed .",
    "besides possible velocity cross - overs , e.g. the motion in @xmath21 translating into a vertical motion ( for an example see fig . 7 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) invoked by systematic distance errors @xcite , neglected sample rotation can be the reason .",
    "in any sample that is not demonstrably rotation - free and is not symmetric in galactic longitude the streaming motion offsets the mean heliocentric radial motion and hence the inferred solar motion .",

    "shows the heliocentric @xmath3 velocities for all stars ( red crosses ) from dr8 and stars with @xmath135 ( light blue points ) against @xmath136 .",
    "i set @xmath137 , and the value for @xmath1 accordingly to @xmath138 .",
    "the metal - rich subsample displays a nearly linear relationship of the mean @xmath3 velocity versus @xmath136 as expected for rotational streaming from equation ( [ eq : p7rot ] ) .",
    "this streaming motion is far larger than the expected offset caused by the solar lsr motion @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "even the mild asymmetry in @xmath10 distorts a naive estimate of @xmath9 in disregard of rotation to @xmath140 for metal - rich objects with @xmath135 and @xmath141 for the entire sample .",
    "consistent with the rotational bias the deviation from the standard lsr value is significantly larger for the disc sample .",
    "to rid my results from this bias , i use the estimator @xmath142 where the free parameters @xmath4 and @xmath143 are the effective rotation and the reflex of the solar motion , @xmath144 describes noise from both velocity dispersion and observational scatter that should have zero mean independent of @xmath10 .",
    "i obtain @xmath145 for the metal - rich subsample and @xmath146 for all stars .",
    "the formal errors are mildly underestimated due to the non - gaussianity of the @xmath3 velocity distribution and a non - weighted fit .",
    "this differs from the @xcite estimate at marginal significance .",
    "yet there are larger uncontrolled systematic biases : this fit implies that the effective rotation term carries away all the observed bias on @xmath9 .",
    "while the detailed rotation pattern is not of interest here , the measurement will still be biased if one encounters a larger fraction of slow rotators on one side than on the other .",
    "e.g. a different number of halo stars or unmatched differences of rotation with galactocentric radius can distort @xmath4 , which correlates with @xmath9 . in this sample @xmath9 shrinks by @xmath147 for every @xmath11 decrease in @xmath4 .",
    "in the present case such effects are below detectability , as can be seen from the lower panel in , where the binned means ( green error bars ) show no significant deviation from the linear relationship .",
    "further , any remaining systematic distance errors can lead to systematic velocity shifts .",
    "the first error can be controlled by selecting only stars with small @xmath10 , the second by selecting stars near the galactic centre and anticentre directions . in principle",
    "this could be tested by geometric cuts on the sample , however , there are no data near the galactic plane . exploring",
    "the full parameter space of possible cuts reveals some expected fluctuations of order @xmath148 , but no striking systematics .",
    "for example @xmath149 gives @xmath150 in concordance with the full sample .",
    "more importantly , cuts for a smaller distance range , which is more reliable concerning the proper motion uncertainties favour @xmath151 .",
    "the difference is caused by the @xmath152 most remote stars displaying a rather extreme @xmath153 .",
    "e.g. cutting for @xmath154 i get @xmath155 , again consistent with @xmath156 for @xmath149 , demonstrating that this drift in distance is not an effect of some rotation error . a similar rise in @xmath9 to up to @xmath157",
    "can be achieved by increasingly tight cuts on the signal to noise ratio , which indirectly selects a shorter mean distance . a global line - of - sight velocity increment",
    "@xmath158 increases the estimate for @xmath9 by about @xmath147 .",
    "it is interesting to investigate into the question of a trend in radial velocities with galactocentric radius @xmath27 as suggested in @xcite . to this purpose",
    "i estimate the equation @xmath159 where @xmath4 is the effective rotation , @xmath27 the galactocentric radius , @xmath160 is the effective ( heliocentric ) radial velocity gradient on the sample , and @xmath161 is the noise term from velocity dispersion .",
    "for convenience i limit @xmath162 as before and get on the full distance range @xmath163 at @xmath164 . on the shorter distance range of @xmath165",
    "i get @xmath166 and @xmath167 , delivering no sensible gradient at all . restricting @xmath135",
    "i get @xmath168 .",
    "this residual trend is caused by the @xmath169 stars with @xmath44 measuring @xmath170 . while this may finally be the desired signal , it is puzzling to have no more metal - poor counterpart .",
    "hence this is more likely either be a statistical fluctuation or some flaw in the sample .",
    "parameters and distances for stars with super - solar metallicity in segue are likely problematic , particularly as i do not have sufficient numbers to constrain their mean distance very well .",
    "it has to be noted that this sample is at rather high altitudes and is dominantly in the outer disc , so that velocity trends in objects of the inner thin disc might not show up .",
    "hence the missing detection of an appreciable trend ( and exclusion of a significant deviation from circularity ) does not disprove @xcite .",
    "more of a problem for their result should be the larger value of @xmath9 , which likely reduces or diminishes their estimated gradient , as their analysis mainly relies on assumption of the old value and does not have sufficient data points in the outer disc to provide a decent fix .",
    "after all , when accounting for the systematic uncertainties in the data , i can not detect any reliable hint for a motion of the solar neighbourhood against some more global galactic standard of rest . combining these estimates with the result from the mean direction of motion ( see section [ sec : p7direct ] ) of @xmath171 with a systematic uncertainty of @xmath172 and the reader may either use this value or a lower @xmath173 , taking into account the value to the older gcs .",
    "so far i exclusively looked at the global rotation pattern and its influence on @xmath9 , but the new rotation estimator can do more : any measurement relying on observed azimuthal velocities does not provide the real rotation of the component in question , but only a value relative to the sun , from which we conclude its azimuthal speed by discounting for the galactic circular velocity plus the solar azimuthal lsr motion ( plus a small part of the solar radial motion when @xmath174 ) . on the contrary",
    "the radial velocity part of ( [ eq : p7rot ] ) uses the velocity differences at a range of galactic positions and gives the `` real '' rotation of the component without significant influence by assumptions on the motion of the sun .",
    "the measurement is in most cases less precise than the azimuthal measurement , but is nevertheless interesting by its different set of assumptions .",
    "consider a possible presence of stellar streams : they can distort azimuthal velocity measurements soliciting an independent source of information : in general a stream will then show up in highly different values for the two rotational velocity indicators .",
    "the price one has to pay for the radial velocity estimator is a larger formal error , the need for extended samples , a different dependence on the assumed @xmath0 ( which is usually a bonus ) and some stronger vulnerability to distortions from axisymmetry , e.g. influence by the galactic bar .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , dissecting a sample by kinematics is detrimental for this kind of kinematic analysis , but one can divide the galaxy into its components by a selection in metallicity .    shows the rotation measurement from the radial velocity estimator when i dissect the sample into bins of @xmath175 objects in metallicity and move half a bin in each step ( large red error bars ) . the two plateaus of disc and halo rotation with the transition region in between show up nicely .",
    "the plateau of disc rotation stays about @xmath176 below the circular speed of the disc due to asymmetric drift .",
    "clearly there is no significant average net rotation in the metal - poor galactic halo . despite the far smaller formal error , this would be more difficult to state on firm grounds by using the average azimuthal velocity alone ( blue error bars ) , which does depend strongly on the solar galactocentric motion .",
    "in fact the azimuthal velocity estimator has been shifted onto the @xmath3 estimator s curve by matching @xmath177 , which turns us to the topic of the next subsection .",
    "more important than mutual confirmation of results one can play off the two rotation measurements ( from @xmath3 and @xmath22 ) against each other .",
    "as stated before , only @xmath22 depends on the solar azimuthal velocity , so that forcing both rotation estimators into agreement we obtain an estimate for the total solar azimuthal velocity in the galactic rest frame @xmath1 . by subtraction of the solar lsr motion",
    "this directly estimates the galactic circular speed @xmath2 near the solar radius without any need to invoke complicated models .",
    "the apparent difference caused by a wrong @xmath1 is demonstrated in the top panel of .",
    "for this plot i lowered @xmath1 from the optimal value by about @xmath37 .",
    "comparison with the previous figure reveals that the red bars are unchanged as expected , while the azimuthal velocity based measurements are pushed upwards into stark disagreement .    to bring the two rotation measurements on common ground one has to apply weights to the estimate of the mean azimuthal velocity @xmath178 for each subpopulation : in a least squares estimate on the rotation speed @xmath4 each star appropriates a weight proportional to its distance from the population",
    "mean on the baseline @xmath179 . as the value @xmath180 invoked by rotation varies linearly on this baseline , each star attains the weight @xmath181 when measuring rotation . introducing a simultaneously weighted mean for the mean azimuthal velocity @xmath182 where the sum runs over all stars @xmath100 , any structural differences between the two estimators",
    "are eliminated , since every population enters both estimators with equal weights .",
    "this measurement of the solar velocity does thus not require any modelling of galactic populations or any other deeper understanding at all .",
    "the procedure is then very simple :    * assume @xmath0 and a first guess solar velocity vector @xmath183 * estimate @xmath4 and @xmath184 . *",
    "reduce @xmath185 by the difference @xmath186 and recalculate @xmath4 , @xmath184 until convergence .",
    "the only remaining uncertainty ( apart from systematic measurement errors ) can arise if the geometry of the sample allows for a distortion in the radial velocity estimator .",
    "i hence recommend controlling the value of @xmath9 , which is well - behaved for this sample , and in other case fixing it to a predetermined value . in the latter case",
    "the weights of @xmath184 must be changed to @xmath187 .",
    "the weighted averages on the azimuthal velocities are drawn with the green line in .",
    "generally the weighted values in the disc regime are a bit lower , because the extreme ends on @xmath188 are populated by remote stars at higher altitudes and at larger asymmetric drift outweighing other effects like the polewards lines of sight reaching higher altitudes .    via the galactic angle @xmath10 the assumed solar galactocentric radius enters the derivation .",
    "as depicted in the larger @xmath0 , the smaller the derived @xmath189 will be for stars on our side of the galaxy .",
    "this results in a larger rotation speed @xmath4 required for the same observed pattern and so finally increases the estimate of @xmath1 .",
    "fortunately the rotation speed of galactic components is lower than the solar value and further  in contrast to the linear oort constants  the dependence on @xmath10 is not linear in distance , which helps towards a relationship flatter than a mere proportionality between @xmath2 and @xmath190 .",
    "this is shown with the red error bars in . for the practical calculation",
    "i bin the sample in distance and move a mask of @xmath175 stars width in steps of @xmath191 stars .",
    "this stabilises the results against scatter from the coarse binning , the error is corrected for the induced autocorrelation .",
    "the result is then drawn from a weighted average of the distance bins .",
    "the binning in distance is mandatory in this sample not mainly because of reddening uncertainties , but because of the previously described anomaly in the mean radial velocities with distance .",
    "this way contaminations are kept at a minimum level .    by using the proper motion of sgr @xmath15 ( determined as @xmath192 by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a second constraint the galactocentric radius can be fixed to @xmath193 and @xmath194 . for the resulting circular",
    "speed one has to subtract about @xmath195 .",
    "one can even gain an estimate for the galactocentric radius that is fully independent of any other results .",
    "for this purpose we have to recapitulate again the impact of @xmath0 on the derived @xmath1 for different populations , shown in : the measurement of @xmath1 compares the weighted azimuthal velocity in any population to the derived absolute rotation @xmath4 .",
    "changing the galactocentric radius @xmath0 makes the galactic coordinate system bend differently and hence gives only minor changes to @xmath22 , but strongly affects @xmath188 . this way @xmath4 is nearly proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "a weakly rotating population has a far smaller value of @xmath4 and hence experiences a far smaller change than fast rotating disc stars .",
    "if we now underestimate @xmath0 , the estimates for @xmath4 are compressed compared to the @xmath22 based estimator as demonstrated in the bottom panel of . in other words",
    "the estimates of @xmath1 for disc stars get sheared against the estimates for halo stars .",
    "however , for all populations one measures the same quantity , i.e. the azimuthal speed of the sun , which can not change between the samples . a deviation in @xmath0 is hence easily detected by dissecting the sample in metallicity , which is ( as can be seen from figure  [ fig : p7rotmet ] ) a very good proxy for rotation .",
    "i cut the sample again into bins of @xmath175 stars  now in metallicity instead of distance  and evaluate the trend @xmath1 @xmath196 of @xmath1 against the mean azimuthal speed between the bins by fitting the linear equation @xmath197 with @xmath198 as additional free parameter .",
    "from the red error bars in one can see that already on the quite modest sample size and extension of the @xmath199 usable stars in dr8 i get a useful , independent estimate of the solar galactocentric radius @xmath200 .    as in the first measurement i used the absolute value of rotation , while here the unit - less slope @xmath196 is employed ,",
    "the two results are formally independent and can be combined to @xmath6 in excellent agreement with @xcite .",
    "this translates to @xmath7 . working in the lsr value of @xcite",
    "i hence obtain @xmath8 .      to assess the systematic uncertainties i vary some of the assumptions .",
    "first i checked that the choice of bin size does not change the results more than the general noise induced by bin changes as long as the bins are not unreasonably small .",
    "galactic rotation at fixed @xmath0 is increased by about @xmath120 , when i globally augment distances by @xmath45 and would be about @xmath201 lower without the @xcite distance correction . increasing the distance scatter by applying an additional @xmath45 raises @xmath1 by @xmath202 at fixed radius , application of a @xmath203 error lowers it by @xmath204 .",
    "the mild lowering is expected , since the strong distance scatter should give a global distance underestimate of @xmath205 ( consistently the rotation measurement from @xmath3 velocities drops by @xmath206 ) .",
    "it is obvious that such a scatter has a minor effect , as the relation between @xmath180 and @xmath188 is linear and hence at small changes the mean of @xmath180 is only mildly affected .",
    "this is a benefit from operating remote from the galactic centre where the changes in galactic angle become more rapid .",
    "the mean azimuthal velocity is mostly affected by distance scatter via the bias on average distance derived from our statistical method .",
    "tests reveal an expected systematic bias of order @xmath116 .",
    "similarly the slope of the derived rotation speed @xmath207 depends mostly on distance . here",
    "the dependence is larger : it reacts by @xmath208 , i.e. about @xmath209 standard deviations to a forced increase of @xmath45 in distance and by @xmath210 to a forced decrease of @xmath45 .",
    "removing the statistical distance correction would lift values by about @xmath211 .",
    "increased distance scatter without distance correction increases the value by @xmath212 for an additional scatter of @xmath83 and lowers it by @xmath213 for a scatter of @xmath203 .",
    "gravity cuts have minor influence on my results : the mean rotation rate is lowered by @xmath214 when i lift the minimum gravity to @xmath215 and at the same time the trend in azimuthal velocity rises by @xmath216 .",
    "tighter cuts are not feasible for the trend , as i lose all metal poor stars . replacing the sloping cut by a fixed @xmath39 ,",
    "did not significantly alter the results ether . while the distance estimator strongly hints to some contamination of the dwarf sample , the observed deviation in @xmath0 is still not significant and likely results partly from random scatter , as many metal - poor objects are lost by this tighter cut .",
    "the robustness of the result against changes in the gravity selection points to the statistical distance estimator being able to cope with the different contamination by adjusting the mean distances .",
    "the largest uncertainty appears to arise from the proper motion determinations .",
    "the correction i apply raises rotational velocities by about @xmath217 and in light of the unsatisfactory physical reasoning as discussed in section [ sec : p7pm ] it is uncertain how well the correction works . a little reassurance is given by the second estimator , its unitless slope rises by only @xmath218 upon removal of the proper motion correction .",
    "the applied line - of - sight velocity correction lowers @xmath1 by about @xmath219 and lowers the unitless slope by just @xmath220 .",
    "the better robustness of the second estimator for @xmath0 reflects the fact that any spurious rotation affects both halo and disc rotation in a similar way and hence their difference is more robust than the mean .",
    "further i find that a change of @xmath9 in the calculation of galactocentric azimuthal velocities ( a minor bias is expected in the lopsided sample ) is irrelevant to the estimated quantities .",
    "however , if the rotation estimates themselves are done with fixed @xmath9 instead of using it as a free parameter , the estimates agree fully when setting @xmath221 , and @xmath1 falls by about @xmath201 for every @xmath116 reduction in @xmath9 .",
    "depending on how much integrity we ascribe to the astrometry in the sample this sets an interesting relation between @xmath9 and @xmath0 .",
    "similarly @xmath9 can be determined by demanding the estimate for @xmath1 to be consistent in galactic longitude @xmath222 .",
    "not surprisingly the favoured value is again @xmath12 .",
    "i further tested that there are no trends of the rotation estimate ( with fixed @xmath9 ) with colour , distance or latitude .",
    "the estimator of @xmath9 from section [ sec : p7lsr ] depends weakly on distance .",
    "@xmath9 increases by about @xmath223 for a global @xmath83 increase in distances and decreases by about the same amount for a distance increase .",
    "its counterpart @xmath4 changes by around @xmath224 with some fluctuations as different distance cuts can affect the sample composition .",
    "the proper motion correction is responsible for about @xmath217 of the measured @xmath4 and @xmath225 of @xmath9 , while the line - of - sight velocity correction acts in the opposite direction , lowering @xmath4 by @xmath120 and @xmath9 by @xmath226 .      as a third strategy for fixing galactic parameters",
    "i suggest the direction of motion .",
    "all that needs to be done is to compare the expected galactic angle @xmath10 to the angle that the galactocentric mean motion in the subsamples has against the local azimuth .",
    "the upper panel in shows the angle @xmath227 of the mean velocity for a binned sample of all stars with @xmath228 ( above that value i expect sufficient rotation ) assuming a solar azimuthal velocity @xmath177 , @xmath229 and plotting only bins with more than @xmath230 stars .",
    "the lines show positions of constant galactic angle @xmath10 . for easier fits",
    "i note that the ratio @xmath231 behaves as @xmath232 as long as we stay away from @xmath233 ( avoiding the arctangent gives better convergence when starting far from the optimal parameters ) .",
    "it is obvious that this kind of statistic critically depends on the choice of @xmath9 and the total azimuthal velocity of the sun .",
    "formally the agreement between the position angle and the velocity angle is optimised by fitting @xmath234 @xmath235 to @xmath236 , where @xmath237 does the correction from the first guess @xmath238 to the parametrised solar radial velocity @xmath9 and @xmath239 and @xmath240 are the coordinates of the local cartesian frame in the radial ( outwards ) and azimuthal direction .    while i can fit @xmath9 directly to these data ,",
    "this is not possible for @xmath241 as the fit would then converge to the wrong global minimum : let @xmath241 and @xmath0 go to infinity and the fit becomes perfect with all ratios / angles zeroed . in this light",
    "i vary @xmath241 externally and allow for @xmath9 and @xmath0 as free fit parameters .",
    "all bins were weighted by the inverse number of stars they contain and i only accepted bins with more than @xmath230 objects .",
    "i note that velocity dispersions potentially exert a ( predictable ) distortion on @xmath236 by its non - linearity , but found this effect to be very small on the current sample .",
    "it is not surprising that the result for the solar radial velocity is @xmath242 in excellent agreement with the direct measurement from stellar @xmath3 velocities and with section [ sec : p7systerr ] .",
    "the result for @xmath0 is shown in the lower panel of , where i plot the new datapoints from angle fitting in addition to the previously discussed data .",
    "the formal error on @xmath0 at fixed @xmath1 is a small @xmath243 , but their relation largely resembles that of sgr @xmath5 .",
    "i would need a larger sample extension and/or significantly more stars to compete with sgr @xmath5 , which will be achieved with gaia .",
    "for now , formal inclusion of the third constraint hence does not change the final results and just reduces the formal errors a bit .",
    "nevertheless the potential of this estimator for larger samples is evident .",
    "the residuals of the fit will likely outline perturbations of the galactic potential and substructure with data from gaia , but in the present sample i could not detect any structure .    adding stars with halo metallicities to the test",
    "just drives up the error bars by a factor of @xmath244 because of the higher dispersion , while no rotating stars are added .",
    "@xmath0 stays the same while @xmath9 shifts to @xmath245 . restricting the disc sample to a distance closer than @xmath246 increases @xmath0 and @xmath9 by insignificant @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "the value for @xmath9 depends on the position of the galactic centre .",
    "if our coordinate system was off - centre by @xmath249 degree in galactic longitude , @xmath9 could shift down by about @xmath224 .",
    "the most important outcomes of this work are three modelling - free and simple estimators for the solar azimuthal velocity and hence the local circular speed @xmath2 and for the solar galactocentric radius @xmath0 .",
    "on this course i developed the idea that in a spatially extended sample the absolute rotation of stellar components can be measured from systematic streaming in the heliocentric radial direction .",
    "the stars on one side of the galactic centre show an opposite heliocentric @xmath3 velocity to those on the other side .",
    "this value has a lower formal precision than the classically used azimuthal velocity , but can boost accuracy by its relative independence from assumptions about the velocity of the sun .",
    "the rotation in any extended sample severely affects determinations of the local standard of rest : @xmath9 and @xmath250 are frequently determined via simple sample averages in each component .",
    "the rotation bias in @xmath9 gets more important with increasing distance and impacts all presently available big surveys , since they are lopsided , i.e. asymmetric in galactic longitude . for segue",
    "dwarfs it amounts to @xmath251 .",
    "accounting for rotation the otherwise observed difference between disc and halo stars disappears and combining this classic method with the estimate from the mean direction of motion described below , i find @xmath252 with an additional systematic uncertainty of about @xmath148 .",

    "the circular speed @xmath257 using the lsr value of @xmath258 from @xcite is then @xmath8 .",
    "the third approach uses just the direction of motion in the galaxy to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "assuming near axisymmetry again the direction of motion in a sample should always point in the direction of the azimuth .",
    "fitting the galactic angle throughout the plane to the angle of motion provides @xmath0 .",
    "this measurement displays a strong dependence on the solar radial motion apart from the dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "fortunately @xmath9 and @xmath0 are not degenerate and i obtain again a relatively large @xmath242 , confirming the previous conventional analysis , but with an even smaller formal error . as",
    "the resulting relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath0 is only weakly inclined against the result from sgr @xmath5 , this approach will be of relevance for larger samples and here just provides some reassurance .",
    "the laid out strategies are extremely simple .",
    "they do not rely on any modelling with possible hidden assumptions , so that possible biases are readily understood .",
    "they rely on the sole assumption of near axisymmetry of the galactic disc .",
    "they are designed for thick disc stars that reside high above the galactic plane and are by their position and high random energy far less affected by perturbations of the galactic potential , like the spiral pattern .",
    "their modelling independence is supported by the fact that by construction none of the estimators depends on the detailed changes of sample composition with position in the galaxy or on the radial dependence of @xmath2 .",
    "still some uncertainties must be pointed out : the methods are vulnerable to large - scale distortions from axisymmetry in the galactic disc . the bar region should be avoided , and there may be a residual signal from spiral arms .",
    "i could not detect significant structures connected to this , so the consequences should be rather small , particularly as i stay out of the region dominated by the bar and as the sample is sufficiently extended not to cover just one side of a spiral arm .",
    "the currently available data add to the possible biases by their uncertain distances , radial velocities and especially astrometry . the segue proper motions display a distinctive systematic pattern on quasar samples .",
    "while i use the quasar catalogues for corrections , the solution remains unsatisfactory : i could not quantify separately the physical reasons , i.e. chromatic aberrations , astrometric `` frame - dragging '' by stars mistaken for galaxies or even focal plane distortions of the telescopes , and also there might be some undetected dependence on the stellar colours .",
    "further some minor uncertainty in parameters is caused by possible biases in line - of - sight velocities .",
    "i made extensive use of the distance corrections developed by @xcite . besides that this project would have been futile without the accuracy achieved by the statistical corrections , the outcome is prone to all the weaknesses of that method . especially streams and wrong assumptions about the velocity ellipsoid can induce systematic distance errors of order @xmath259 .",
    "the contamination in the sample will vary to some extent with galactic coordinates , an effect that i did not model .",
    "this can lead to a bias , because the distribution of weights in the rotation estimators and the distance estimator is different . the accuracy could be far better could i use more stars and had i better control of the systematic errors by another dataset .",
    "part of this will be resolved by use of additional samples like rave .",
    "fortunately the estimators show very different behaviour on the different biases : the proper motion problem affects almost exclusively the first estimator for rotation with a correction to @xmath1 of @xmath260 , while the difference between fast and slow rotators is nearly untouched .",
    "vice versa , the difference estimator reacts strongly to distance changes , while the first estimator does not - a @xmath45 change shifts it by @xmath206 . despite their benign distribution",
    "the systematic uncertainties on @xmath1 and @xmath0 may come close to the formal errors .",
    "if the reader should take only one point from this note then let it be this : with the advent of the large surveys stellar samples are regaining their place as a primary source to obtain not only the local standard of rest , but global galactic parameters .",
    "already a sample of @xmath199 stars from segue provides formal accuracies for the galactocentric radius and the solar azimuthal velocity that are competitive with any other known approach and without any need for modelling .",

    "<S> i present three methods to determine the distance to the galactic centre @xmath0 , the solar azimuthal velocity in the galactic rest frame @xmath1 and hence the local circular speed @xmath2 at @xmath0 . these simple , model - independent strategies reduce the set of assumptions to near axisymmetry of the disc and are designed for kinematically hot stars , which are less affected by spiral arms and other effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the first two methods use the position - dependent rotational streaming in the heliocentric radial velocities ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting rotation estimate @xmath4 from @xmath3 velocities does not depend on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the first approach compares this with rotation from the galactic azimuthal velocities to constrain @xmath1 at an assumed @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be determined using the proper motion of sgr @xmath5 as a second constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the second strategy makes use of @xmath4 being roughly proportional to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore a wrong @xmath0 can be detected by an unphysical trend of @xmath1 with the intrinsic rotation of different populations . </S>",
    "<S> from these two strategies i estimate @xmath6 and @xmath7 for a stellar sample from segue , or respectively @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is consistent with the third estimator , where i use the angle of the mean motion of stars , which should follow the geometry of the galactic disc . </S>",
    "<S> this method also gives the solar radial motion with high accuracy .    </S>",
    "<S> the rotation effect on @xmath3 velocities must not be neglected when measuring the solar radial velocity @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> it biases @xmath9 in any extended sample that is lop - sided in position angle @xmath10 by of order @xmath11 . combining different methods i find @xmath12 , moderately higher than previous results from the geneva - copenhagen survey .    </S>",
