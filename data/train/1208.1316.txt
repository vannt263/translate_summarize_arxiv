    "the only possible transition that is in accordance with the neutron - diffraction and the magnetization measurements is a @xmath69 transition of the er@xmath3 sublattices .",

    "this narrows the number of possible magnetic structures down to two , having either an antiparallel ( @xmath63 ) or parallel ( @xmath70 ) alignment of the er@xmath3 moments on the 4b and 2a sites .",
    "the simref2.6 simulations summarized in fig .  [ fig : fig3](b ) , however , clearly discard er@xmath3 order according to @xmath70 because in this case destructive interference of the er@xmath3(4b ) and er@xmath3(2a ) contributions suppress the ( 100 ) reflection .",

    "by combining the analysis of the magnetic phase diagram in sections  [ magnetization ] to [ structure ] and the analysis of the magnetic transitions between these phases in section  [ transitions ] we are now able to present a comprehensive scenario of the magnetic interactions and the resulting phase transitions in h - ermno@xmath2 with a projection on the h-@xmath11mno@xmath2 series as a whole .",
    "we distinguish two fundamentally different temperature ranges as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](c ) :    _ between the nel temperature and @xmath79  k : _ in this range the magnetic structure is determined by the ordering of the mn@xmath3 sublattice . the mn@xmath3 spins order antiferromagnetically at @xmath57 and promote rare - earth ordering on the er@xmath3(4b ) site .",
    "the er@xmath3(4b ) order is induced at the same temperature , @xmath57 , via a triggering mechanism with biquadratic mn@xmath3er@xmath3(4b ) order - parameter coupling .",
    "both the mn@xmath3 and er@xmath3(4b ) lattice order according to the same representation , @xmath16 .",
    "however , because of the biquadratic coupling this compatibility is not mandatory . indeed , mn@xmath3 and @xmath10(4b ) order according to different representations in h - dymno@xmath2 . in any case , the er@xmath3(2a ) site remains disordered in this temperature range .",
    "_ below @xmath79  k : _ in this range the magnetic structure is determined by the ordering of the er@xmath3(2a ) sublattice . the spins arrange uniformly at @xmath79  k according to the representation @xmath66 with a macroscopic magnetization per domain and a nonzero net magnetization once the magnetic field lifts the degeneracy between oppositely oriented fim domain states .",
    "when the er@xmath3(2a ) order strengthens toward low temperature , the er@xmath3(2a ) ordering at first induces @xmath69 reordering on the er@xmath3(4b ) site ( @xmath83  k ) followed by @xmath81 reordering of the mn@xmath3 sublattice ( @xmath84  k ) .",
    "the coupling to the er@xmath3(2a ) sublattice is linear and therefore not guided by the triggering mechanism .",
    "this is evidenced by the difference between the ( re- ) ordering temperatures and the accordance of the representations describing the magnetic order in the different sublattices .",
    "the er@xmath3(2a ) and er@xmath3(4b ) sites maintain an antiparallel spin orientation that can be overcome in an external magnetic field in the order of magnitude of 1  t driving a transition from ferrimagnetic to ferromagnetic er@xmath3 order .",
    "a similar situation is met in all rare - earth h-@xmath11mno@xmath2 compounds except in h - homno@xmath2 where the ho@xmath3 ground state is antiferromagnetic , yet with similar sublattice correlations as in the other h-@xmath11mno@xmath2 compounds .",
    "in conclusion , the combination of magnetization , shg , and neutron - diffraction experiments at temperatures down to the milli - kelvin regime reveals important features in the magnetic phase diagram of h - ermno@xmath2 .",
    "we identify the spin structure in the respective magnetic phases , the magnetic coupling between the mn@xmath3 , er@xmath3(4b ) , and er@xmath3(2a ) sublattices , and the resulting phase transitions establishing the phase diagram .",
    "we find a high - temperature range above 10  k where the mn@xmath3 sublattice induces magnetic er@xmath3 order and a low - temperature range below 10  k where the er@xmath3 sublattice induces magnetic mn@xmath3 order .",
    "most of all , we find that the ordering on the 4b and 2a sites of the er@xmath3 sublattices play a strikingly independent and different role in establishing the magnetic order in h - ermno@xmath2 . the comprehensive model for the phase diagram of the h - ermno@xmath2 developed in this work can be projected onto the other rare - earth h-@xmath11mno@xmath2 compounds with only small variations .",
    "thus , we are now able to understand the complex magnetic phases of the h-@xmath11mno@xmath2 system on a universal basis ."
