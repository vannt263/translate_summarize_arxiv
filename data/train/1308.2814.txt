    "graphene is a two dimensional crystal composed of carbon atoms packed in a honeycomb lattice .",
    "this material is well known due to its low energy electronic spectrum which can be described by an effective theory with two massless dirac fermions living in two dimensions @xcite . due to",
    "this striking property graphene is a perspective material both for study of different relativistic quantum field theory phenomena and development of new electronic devices .",
    "we base on the effective field theory of graphene . within this approximation the massless electronic excitations in graphene",
    "propagate with the speed @xmath2 . since",
    "this speed is much smaller than the speed of light@xmath3 the interaction between quasiparticles in graphene can be approximated by instantaneous coulomb law with the effective coupling constant @xmath4 . from this fact",
    "one can conclude that electronic excitations in graphene form strongly interacting many body system .    in real experiments graphene",
    "is put on substrate .",
    "the effective coupling constant for graphene on substrate with the dielectric permittivity @xmath5 is smaller by a factor @xmath6 due to the screening .",
    "the variation of dielectric permittivity @xmath5 of substrate changes the effective coupling constant and thus allows to study the properties of graphene in both strong and week coupling regime .    in weak coupling regime theoretical description of graphene properties based on perturbation theory",
    "gives reliable results .",
    "in strong coupling regime there are no theoretical approaches based on first principles . from this perspective monte - carlo simulation of graphene",
    "is the only possibility to study graphene when interaction between quasiparticles is strong .",
    "recently there appeared a lot of papers where graphene electronic properties were studied numerically @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in these papers reveal one picture of insulator - semimetal phase transition in graphene - it takes place at the dielectric permittivity @xmath7 . at weak coupling regime graphene",
    "is in the semimetal phase . in this phase",
    "the conductivity is @xmath8 and there is no gap in the spectrum of fermionic excitations .",
    "the chiral symmetry of graphene is not broken . at strong coupling regime graphene",
    "is in the insulator phase . in this phase the conductivity",
    "is considerably suppressed and there is an energy gap in in the spectrum of fermionic excitations .",
    "the opening of the energy gap is accompanied by the appearance of the fermion chiral condensate @xmath9 , which breaks chiral symmetry of graphene .",
    "but in the most recent paper @xcite it was shown that modification of the quasiparticles interaction potential at small distances dramatically changes the picture of phase transitions in graphene .",
    "suspended graphene is still a conductor ( in agreement with experiment ) and phase transition is shifted into unphysical region @xmath10 . in this paper we do nt make this modification and carry out the simulation as it was done in paper @xcite .",
    "this simulations do nt correspond to experimental results numerically but we still hope that the description of graphene phase diagram will be qualitatively reasonable .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study graphene phase diagram in the external magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene plane . to carry out this investigation the monte - carlo simulation of graphene with dynamical staggered fermions",
    "@xcite will be applied .",
    "this study is motivated by the theoretical interest to understand how external magnetic field can change graphene properties .",
    "in addition , the possibility to control graphene properties through the external magnetic field seems very promising in the development of new electronic devices .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section a brief review of the simulation algorithm",
    "in the last section the results of this paper are presented and discussed .",
    "the partition function of graphene can be written in the following form @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the zero component of the vector potential of the @xmath0 electromagnetic field , @xmath13 are euclidean gamma - matrices and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are two flavours of dirac fermions which correspond to two spin components of the non - relativistic electrons in graphene .",
    "effective coupling constant is @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is assumed ) .",
    "it is worth to note that partition function ( [ partfan ] ) does nt contain dynamical vector part of the potential @xmath18 , since the inclusion of this part leads to the corrections which are suppressed by the factor @xmath19 .",
    "zero component of the vector potential @xmath20 satisfies periodic boundary condition in space and time @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is temperature . in the absence of magnetic field fermion spinors",
    "satisfy periodic boundary condition in space and antiperiodic boundary condition in the time direction @xmath23 .",
    "if magnetic field is switched on , fermion boundary condition in space should be modified @xcite .",
    "the simulation of partition function ( [ partfan ] ) is carried out within the approach developed in @xcite . in order to discretize the fermionic part of the action in ( [ partfan ] ) the staggered fermions @xcite",
    "one flavor of staggered fermions in @xmath1 dimensions corresponds to two flavors of continuum dirac fermions @xcite , which makes them especially suitable for the simulations of the graphene effective field theory .",
    "the action for staggered fermions coupled to abelian lattice gauge field is @xmath24 } =   \\sum\\limits_{x , y } \\bar{\\psi}_x \\ , d_{x , y } { \\left [ \\theta_{x , \\ , \\mu } \\right ] } \\ , \\psi_y = \\nonumber \\\\ =   \\frac{1}{2 } \\ , \\sum\\limits_{x } \\ , \\delta_{x_3 , \\ , 0 } \\ , \\left (   \\sum\\limits_{\\mu=0 , 1 , 2 }   \\bar{\\psi}_x \\alpha_{x , \\mu } e^{i \\theta_{x , \\ , \\mu } } \\psi_{x+\\hat{\\mu } }   - \\right .",

    "we have also introduced the matrix elements @xmath33 of the staggered dirac operator .    it should be noted here that nonzero mass term in ( [ lat_act_interact ] ) is necessary in order to ensure the invertibility of the staggered dirac operator @xmath33 .",
    "numerical results in the physical limit of zero mass is obtained by performing simulations at several nonzero values of @xmath34 and by extrapolating the expectation values of physical observables to @xmath35 .",
    "to discretize the electromagnetic part of partition function ( [ partfan ] ) noncompact action is used @xmath36 } = \\frac{\\beta}{2 } \\ , \\sum\\limits_x \\sum\\limits^{3}_{i=1 }   { \\left (   \\theta_{x , \\ , 0 } - \\theta_{x + \\hat{i } , \\ , 0 }   \\right ) } ^2   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summation is carried out over all lattice .",
    "the constant @xmath37 is defined as follows @xmath38 the factor @xmath39 takes into account the electrostatic screening of the coulomb interaction due to the substrate .",
    "the introduction of nonzero homogeneous magnetic field @xmath40 perpendicular to graphene plane can be done in a standard way through the modification of the link variable @xmath41 , which corresponds to the vector potential @xmath42 . as the result of torus geometry of the lattice the flux of the magnetic field through the whole lattice",
    "@xmath43 is quantized as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a digit number .",
    "quantization of the flux @xmath43 leads to the quantization of the magnetic field which can be modeled on the lattice @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the size of the lattice .",
    "since action ( [ lat_act_interact ] ) is bilinear in fermionic fields , they can be integrated out @xmath48 } - s_{\\psi } { \\left [ \\bar{\\psi}_x , \\psi_x , \\theta_{x , \\ , 0 } \\right ] } \\right ) }   = \\nonumber \\\\",

    "both algorithms satisfy the detailed balance condition for weight ( [ ferm_integrated ] ) @xcite .",
    "successive application of these algorithms does not , in general , have this property . nevertheless , by using the composition rule for transition probabilities it is easy to demonstrate that the path integral weight ( [ ferm_integrated ] ) is still the stationary probability distribution for such a combination of both algorithms .",
    "while local heatbath updates are computationally very cheap , they significantly decrease the autocorrelation time of the algorithm .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to measure the electric conductivity of graphene in external magnetic field , that is , a linear response of the electric current density @xmath55 to the applied homogeneous electric field @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 is the real minkowski time ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the ac conductivity @xmath58 , so that @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    ". due to rotational symmetry of effective field theory ( [ partfan ] ) , the @xmath58 should have the form @xmath62 .",
    "correspondingly , the dc conductivity is equal to the value of @xmath63 at @xmath64 .    by virtue of the green - kubo dispersion relations",
    "@xcite , the euclidean current - current correlators @xmath65 can be expressed in terms of the @xmath63 as @xmath66 where the thermal kernel @xmath67 is @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the euclidean time .",
    "we use here a nonstandard definition of the kernel ( [ kernel ] ) from @xcite , which is more convenient for numerical analysis .",
    "note that the current density in graphene is the charge which flows through the unit length in unit time and thus has the dimensionality of @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 stands for length ) in units with @xmath72 . correspondingly , the current density in lattice units is the charge which flows through a link of the dual lattice of length @xmath73 in time @xmath74 .",
    "thus in order to express the current - current correlator ( [ corr ] ) in physical units , one should multiply the results obtained on the lattice by @xmath75 , where the additional factor @xmath76 comes from integration over @xmath77 , @xmath78 in ( [ corr ] ) . with the euclidean time @xmath79 in ( [ corr ] ) , ( [ corr_eq ] ) and ( [ kernel ] )",
    "being expressed in units of lattice spacing in temporal direction @xmath74 , integration over @xmath80 in ( [ corr_eq ] ) also includes a factor @xmath81 .",
    "we thus conclude that the ac conductivity @xmath63 is dimensionless .",
    "moreover , the dc conductivity @xmath82 is a universal quantity which does not depend on the lattice spacing or on the ratio of lattice spacings in temporal and spatial directions . for conversion to the si system of units ,",
    "it should be multiplied by @xmath83 .    in numerical simulations",
    "@xmath84 is measured for several ( @xmath85 ) discrete values of @xmath79 . a commonly used method to invert relation ( [ corr_eq ] ) and to extract the continuum function @xmath63 from the lattice discretization of @xmath84",
    "is the maximum entropy method @xcite . but",
    "this method suffers from some technical difficulties , so we use middle point of euclidean current - current correlator to measure the conductivity at low frequencies ( see @xcite for further details ) : @xmath86    for staggered fermions the electric current @xmath87 can be expressed in terms of the fields @xmath88 as @xcite : @xmath89 where we took into account that the spatial link variables @xmath90 are effectively equal to zero . since current ( [ j_staggered ] ) is defined on the lattice with double lattice spacing , we calculate the euclidean current - current correlator ( [ corr ] ) only on time slices with even @xmath79 .    to study insulator - semimetal phase transition",
    "it is useful to consider the fermion condensate @xmath91 . in the insulator phase @xmath92 and in the semimetal phase @xmath93",
    "so , the fermion condensate @xmath91 is the order parameter for the insulator - semimetal phase transition . in terms of staggered fermions",
    "it can be written as @xmath94 since the fermions in the partition function are integrated out , the current - current correlator ( [ corr ] ) and chiral condensate ( [ condensate_def ] ) can be expressed in terms of expectation values of certain combinations of the staggered fermion propagator @xmath95 } $ ] with respect to weight ( [ ferm_integrated ] ) .",
    "+    using the algorithm described in the previous section , we have generated @xmath96 statistically independent gauge field configurations on the @xmath97 lattice for each set of the parameters ( @xmath5 , @xmath34 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "the results in the limit of zero mass was obtained by performing simulations at several nonzero values of the @xmath98 and extrapolating the expectation values of physical observables to @xmath35 for each pair ( @xmath5 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "the dielectric permittivity of the substrate was varied within the range @xmath99 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath40 was varied in the interval which corresponds 17 quanta of the magnetic flux ( [ quantum ] ) through the whole lattice .",
    "it should be noted that for the lattice used in the calculation one quantum of magnetic flux corresponds to the field @xmath100 t. this large value of the magnetic field results from the fact that @xmath101 , @xmath47is the size of graphene sample ( spatial size of the lattice ) .",
    "although today our computers do nt allow to consider lattice of the size much larger than @xmath97 , we plan to do this in future .      in figure",
    "[ fig : condensates ] the fermion condensate @xmath102 as a function of the dielectric permittivity of substrate @xmath5 in the limit @xmath103 at different values of @xmath40 is shown . from this plot",
    "one sees that for each value of magnetic field the condensate @xmath104 for small values of the @xmath5 and @xmath105 for large values of the @xmath5 . to determine the critical value @xmath106",
    "the data for @xmath107 were fitted by the function @xmath108 for each magnetic field @xmath40 .",
    "thus the critical permittivity @xmath106 as a function of magnetic field was determined .      from the study of the fermion condensate",
    "@xmath102 one can state that external magnetic field shifts the insulator - semimetal phase transition in graphene to the direction of larger values of the @xmath5",
    ".    physical interpretation of the observed phenomenon is the following .",
    "external magnetic field enhances the density of the eigenfunctions of dirac operator @xmath109 } $ ] at zero eivenvalue , what leads to the enhancement of the condensate @xmath102 .",
    "the larger the value of the condensate , the larger the value of the @xmath5 is needed to screen the charges of quasiparticles and destroy the condensate .",
    "similar phenomenon takes place in qcd @xcite .    in the paper @xcite the planar ( 2 + 1 )",
    "quantum electrodynamics with two degenerate ( 2 + 1 ) staggered fermions in an external magnetic field was investigated .",
    "the authors shown that external magnetic field led to dynamical mass generation and appearance of nonzero fermion condensate @xmath104 in weak coupling region .",
    "contrary to @xcite in this paper 3 + 1 electrodynamics was simulated .",
    "within the accuracy of the calculation dynamical mass generation in the weak coupling region has not been found . to study this question in more detail",
    "we have generated @xmath110 statistically independent gauge field configurations on the @xmath97 lattice deep in the weak coupling region ( @xmath111 ) for different magnetic fields in the range @xmath112 kt . in fig .",
