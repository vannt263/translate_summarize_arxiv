    "among cosmic environments , small scale systems of galaxies ( sssgs ) in the field are those in which not only galaxy  galaxy interactions but also the evolution of cosmic structures can be studied at a `` cellular '' level . to the sssg class of cosmic structure",
    "we may ascribe galaxy systems with different richness and density characteristics spanning from compact groups to poorer configurations like galaxy pairs .",
    "together with compact galaxy groups ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , investigated in definitely more detail , recent x - ray observations suggest the physical reality of some loose groups @xcite and even pairs @xcite .",
    "the x - ray diffuse component and the plethora of faint galaxies associated to the few dominant members is interpreted as due to the presence of a deep potential well @xcite .    are then sssgs long lasting associations or , in the hierarchical evolution scenario , the debris of older , richer and sparse configurations ? are pairs the debris of a pristine group and consequently a way station toward isolated es ?",
    "ngc 1132 , an isolated elliptical with extended x - ray diffuse emission @xcite , could be a prototypical example of the evolution of such systems .",
    "some scenarios @xcite depict rich and compact galaxy structures , like hickson compact groups , as substructures of larger ones , with different degree of equilibrium .",
    "@xcite found typically 20 to 50 dwarf galaxies associated to their x - ray detected groups . in this context ,",
    "sssgs of different richness and degree of compactness have to be studied comparatively as `` single '' class of cosmic environments .",
    "the understanding of galaxy  galaxy interaction phases and the evolution of cosmic structures are deeply interconnected .",
    "galaxy encounters in sssgs are less frequent than in galaxy clusters , but the low velocity dispersion of the sssg may lead to efficient merging episodes @xcite .",
    "interactions could severely alter the properties of a galaxy up to modify the original morphological class @xcite and then re - direct the evolution of a galaxy triggering various phenomena ranging from star formation @xcite to galaxy activity @xcite . in this picture , the environment plays a key role since it dictates the predominant type of encounters @xcite .",
    "a connection should then exist between the local environment and the global properties of galaxies inhabiting it . for rich galaxy systems ,",
    "many aspects of the connection between environment and galaxy properties have emerged , from radio @xcite to x - ray properties @xcite .",
    "the link between the environment and the galaxy evolution in sssgs is still not fully understood @xcite and partly suffers a shortage of information with respect to richer environments .    in order to understand which parameters dominate in galaxy interactions",
    ", we started a study of sssgs , defined in 3d redshift space .",
    "sssgs have been selected in a low density environment , i.e.  they appear as overdense systems with respect to the average galaxy distribution .",
    "the present paper collects photometric and spectrophotometric data for the main members of a sample of sssgs . within the picture described above , dominant galaxies in sssg",
    "have potentially the power of revealing the history and evolutionary phase of the respective sssgs .",
    "elliptical galaxies may be at the center of the potential well of a sssg as suggested by x - ray observations @xcite and could present fine structures @xcite reminiscent of past interaction events .",
    "spiral galaxies in mixed pairs could be the last un  digested member of a pre  existing group @xcite and could reveal their on  going interaction not only through morphological distortion but also in their possibly triggered activity .",
    "the goals of the present paper are the following : 1 ) to obtain a redshift estimate which will provide an independent check of the systemic velocities of the sssg members typically made available by large redshift surveys , 2 ) to investigate the structure of the member galaxies through a detailed surface photometry , 3 ) to analyze the possible induced activity using medium resolution spectroscopy and diagnostic models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the sample is defined in   2 .",
    "a description of the photometric and spectroscopic observations , data reduction and analysis is given in   3 , while results of individual objects are presented in ",
    "4 . the global morphological , photometric and spectroscopic properties of the present sample as a function of the sssg and sssg member properties",
    "are discussed in   5 .",
    "the sssg sample includes 11 systems of 2 or more galaxies lying at similar redshift ( @xmath0cz @xmath2 1000 km / s ) and within a 200 @xmath8kpc radius area , for which new spectroscopic or photometric data have been acquired .",
    "these confirmed sssgs constitute a small subset of a sssgs candidate sample which includes likely misclassified isolated galaxies in zcat @xcite .",
    "the version of zcat used for selection of candidates contains 57536 entries .",
    "the sssgs candidate sample was selected with a two - step procedure : first , isolated galaxies were identified in zcat with an automatic code defining as isolated all those galaxies presenting no neighbour(s ) with known redshift within @xmath0cz @xmath9 1000 km / s and @xmath0r = 1@xmath8 mpc . with this procedure ,",
    "3890 galaxies were selected in the the redshift interval @xmath10 km  s@xmath3 out of a sample of 18677 galaxies in total .",
    "zcat is essentially a redshift compilation rather than a complete sample and also includes a @xmath1125% fraction of galaxies with unknown redshift , therefore , many of the selected isolated galaxies presented one or more projected companion(s ) , and are therefore likely misclassified isolated galaxies . to account for this ,",
    "the code has identified , in the second step , among the isolated galaxies , those presenting nearby projected neighbours ( i.e. neighbours whose redshift is unknown ) , which are clearly likely to represent in fact small scale galaxy systems .",
    "this resulted in 423 candidate sssgs .",
    "all candidates lying within 1 abell radius and @xmath0cz @xmath2 1000 km / s from aco clusters @xcite have been excluded from the sample .",
    "we have also inspected dss images to select among the projected pairs and groups those appearing outside clusters and dense large groups , and are consequently suited for photometric and spectral inspection .",
    "once systems inside clusters are rejected one can safely assume the sssg sample includes only systems in low density environment .",
    "however , we expect that sssgs reside in environments not as sparse as those typically associated to single galaxies , based on the result by @xcite , showing ( in their figure 10 ) that compact groups display a significant excess of neighbours with respect to galaxies lacking a close neighbour .",
    "the sample of galaxy systems we present here is very small : it covers a large range in radial velocity and absolute magnitude , and is partially based on catalogues that are not complete .",
    "further it has been defined making also use of non  automatic selection criteria , causing an intrinsic and hardly quantifiable bias .",
    "therefore , we do not expect the sample to be representative of all galaxy systems in low density environment .",
    "it seems however , that the sample still provide enough information that some general conclusions might be drawn , in particular concerning the different behaviours of early  type and late  type galaxies in pairs and groups detected in low density environments .",
    "the main data for the 11 confirmed sssgs investigated here are presented in [ table-1 ] .",
    "we have checked the ned for sssgs neighbours with known redshift out to a distance of 600@xmath4kpc and 1@xmath4 mpc respectively ( see table [ table-1 ] ) .",
    "though obtained from a data base which is clearly not complete , this information is listed to allow a quantitative first order approximation of the galaxy density around each sssg .",
    "all sssgs are in environments including less than 10 galaxies within a projected area of 1h@xmath12mpc and a redshift range of @xmath91000 km  s@xmath3 from the sssg center .",
    "this is used to argue that sssgs are indeed in a low density environment , ranging from completely isolated to that typical for loose groups .",
    "the observed sample contains additionally 2 sssgs which have not been investigated in detail , namely cgcg 054 - 011 ( @xmath13(2000 ) 17 15 08.7 @xmath14(2000 ) 08 27 22 ) and cgcg 054 - 013 ( @xmath13(2000 ) 17 15 11.9 @xmath14(2000 ) 08 25 35 ) .",
    "according to literature data , they satisfied our selection criteria .",
    "however , our spectroscopic investigation revealed that they are an optical alignment having v@xmath15=10001@xmath911 km  s@xmath3 and v@xmath15=6444@xmath911 km  s@xmath3 respectively .",

    "the new value of the flux intensity of h@xmath17 is used to compute new [ oiii]/h@xmath17 vs. [ nii]/h@xmath13 and [ oiii]/h@xmath17 vs. [ sii]/h@xmath13 ratios ( see errorbars in figure [ figure-6 ] ) . figure [ figure-6 ] shows that late  type galaxies in the sample are dominated by photoionisation : all objects lie in the region of the diagram , which is dominated by hii  regions .",
    "this is the case also for morphologically peculiar galaxies , as e.g. sssg  4b and sssg  6b and even strongly distorted galaxies , e.g. sssg  4a and sssg10a .",
    "star formation rates ( sfr ) were calculated , using the calibration between sfr and h@xmath13 fluxes adopted by @xcite ( see table [ table-5 ] ) :    @xmath36    table [ table-4 ] ( column 12 ) collects the sfr for the disk galaxies of the sample . most disk galaxies ( 9 out of 14 )",
    "can be considered `` normal '' , with star formation rates up to 8 m@xmath7  yr@xmath3 .",
    "the remaining 5 objects have a significantly higher star formation rate .",
    "however only one exceeds the value of 50 m@xmath7  yr@xmath3 , which indicate a major starburst phenomenon .",
    "it is worth remarking that the 5 disk galaxies presenting the higher sfr are hosted in the more isolated sssgs of the sample ( see table [ table-1 ] ) , and in sssgs containing only spiral galaxies .",
    "in this paper we have studied 19 members in 11 sssgs and presented their photometric and spectroscopic properties .",
    "our selection criteria have included small systems ranking from isolated pairs ( kpg 551 , rr23 and rr45 ) with no neighbours of similar luminosity to poor groups in low density environment .",
    "the groups are high density configurations and some of them are catalogued in the literature as nearby poor clusters , as in the case of sssg  1 ( wbl 637 ) and sssg  2 ( wbl 642 ) .",
    "although the relatively small number of objects studied so far does not allow to draw statistically significant conclusions some trends can still be pointed out . early  type galaxies in sssgs , even those which are found in more compact multiplets , do not show relevant signatures of interaction .",
    "the lack of evidence of early  type galaxies being the result of major merger events is a feature in common with hcgs , which have a low fraction of merging candidates and no evidence of enhanced far  infrared emission @xcite .",
    "further , the early  type galaxies of our sample do not show fine structure .",
    "this is not surprising , indeed @xcite found that e.g.  shell structures are found four times less frequently in interacting pairs than in isolated objects of the same class .",
    "this may be attributed to two causes .",
    "first , none of our early  type members is suffering or has recently suffered a strong interaction episode .",
    "most of our early  type members have a disk component or are disky according to the shape parameter @xmath22 which is often larger than 2% .",
    "second , the galaxies suffer `` weak '' but multiple interactions that are likely to destroy shell structures @xcite .    at variance with early  type galaxies spirals displaying patterns typical of ongoing interaction and high star formation rate are found in ssgss .",
    "these ssgss are the most isolated in the sample and additionally are the only ones displaying a total spiral population .",
    "this finding confirms previous results from studies of classical pairs in the @xcite catalog @xcite and pairs catalogs in the southern hemisphere @xcite reporting significant enhancements of star formation due to the infall of fresh gas triggered by the interaction . at the same time",
    "the lack of evidence for enhanced star formation in spirals in the densest sssgs agrees with previous results on hcgs @xcite and on uzc ",
    "cgs @xcite .",
    "neither our sssgs which are strongly interacting nor members in multiplets do show unambiguously the presence of nuclear activity .",
    "further steps in the study of our sample of sssgs are planned / on  going . among these , to obtain x - ray imaging and a deeper mapping of sssgs through wide field imaging data which will permit a better definition of their environment .",
    "the spectroscopic information are then a necessary information to understand the significance of the population of faint galaxies accompanying sssgs in their evolution .",
    "this will allow to test directly small scale substructure formations theories .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy will give the necessary information ( line  strength indices etc . ) about single members evolution .",
