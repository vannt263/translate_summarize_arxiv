    "one of the counterintuitive features of quantum mechanics is nonlocality , whereby operations on a system can instantaneously affect measurements on a distant system with which it had interacted in the past but is now no longer in dynamical interaction with .",
    "it was first considered by einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) , who showed that quantum mechanics is either incomplete or nonlocal @xcite .",
    "they rejected the nonlocal possibility because it implied a superluminal influence in apparent contradiction with special relativity .",
    "however , today quantum nonlocality is widely accepted as a fact thanks to experiments since the mid-1980 s performed both on spin entangled systems @xcite , based on the bohm version @xcite of the epr thought - experiment , which are shown to violate bell s inequality @xcite ( apart from technical caveats concerning detection loopholes @xcite ) , and also on systems entangled in continuous variables ( refs . @xcite and references therein ) , where nonlocality is manifested directly in multi - particle interferences .",
    "it is generally accepted that although quantum nonlocality enforces distant superluminal correlations at the level of individual events , the inherent randomness of the correlated processes prevents the transmission of controllable signals @xcite .",
    "one sees this by noting that the expectation value of an observable of one of a pair of entangled systems remains unaffected by the interaction of a measuring apparatus with the other @xcite .",
    "bussey proved that the probability for outcomes of a measurement on an entangled particle is not affected by a measurement on the other entangled particle @xcite .",
    "jordan argued that the particles of an entangled pair belongs to different subsystems and hence operations on them should commute @xcite . on this basis , he concluded that expectation value for the given observable at one of the particles remains unaffected by operations at the other . in the language of bayesian probability , garrett pointed out that the _ a priori _ and _ a posteriori _ probabilities of results of measurments on a particle are the same given a measurement on its entangled counterpart @xcite . using the density matrix formulation to resolve the epr ` paradox ' , cantrell and scully proved that the reduced density matrix remains the same for both particles in an epr pair before and after measurement on one of them @xcite . on this basis , it is conventionally accepted that that nonlocality and relativistic causality can  coexist peacefully \" @xcite .",
    "however peacock and hepburn have argued that most existing no - signalling proofs are to an extent tautological since they begin by assuming an explicitly local interaction hamiltonian between the measuring instrument and the entangled system @xcite .",
    "here we prove by means of a thought experiment that the superluminal nonlocal influence is in fact noncausal .",
    "the assumption of instantaneous collapse of the wavefunction throughout configuration space is thus shown to be not of purely epistemological significance as held in the orthodox copenhagen interpretation but as leading to controllable superluminal physical effects .",
    "for the purpose of superluminal communcation , the advantage of entanglement in a spatial variable like momentum over spin is that one can modify the wavefunction by using mirrors , lenses , filters and double ( or multiple ) slits before making a measurement .",
    "such a modification is crucial to avoid the consequences of the no - signalling theorem , as we later see .",
    "mirrors and lenses can be used to rotate momentum states , while slits can be used for getting the wavefunction to self - interfere a feature central to the argument below .",
    "the proposed thought experiment is a modification of the original einstein - podolsky - rosen experiment @xcite .",
    "it involves source s of light consisting of entangled photon - pairs .",
    "two spatially seperated observers , alice and bob analyze the light .",
    "alice is equipped with a device , labelled k , to measure momentum or position of the photons in @xmath0 and @xmath1 direction .",
    "bob is equipped with a young s double - slit interferometer , labelled l , with the slits seperated along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "a directional filter assembly is mounted just before the double slit diaphragm , as shown in figure [ bm ] , to ensure that only rays ( almost ) orthogonal to its surface will fall on it .",
    "it consists of two convex lenses in tandem such that their foci coincide .",
    "entry of light towards lens 2 is restricted to a small hole in the focal plane surrounding the focus .",
    "all other light passing from the lens 1 is reflected backwards by the reflector .",
    "a spectral filter behind lens 2 is used to restrict the radiation to a narrow bandwidth about wavelength @xmath2 .",
    "the double slit is shielded from stray radiation by an enclosure with a reflecting exterior .",
    "thus , the only radiation entering the experiment is via lens 1 .",
    "together the filters and the enclosure pass only a unidirectional almost monochromatic light onto the double slit .",
    "the use of reflectors rather than absorbers is to avoid collapsing the wavefunction .",
    "all measurements and detectors are considered to be ideal .",
    "part of the light ( denoted a ) from s is analyzed by alice at time @xmath3 while its epr counterpart ( denoted b ) is analyzed by bob at @xmath4 , where @xmath5 includes the time taken by bob to complete his observation . by prior agreement , at @xmath3 alice will measure either the transverse position coordinate @xmath1 and longitudinal momentum componant @xmath6 of the photons in ensemble a , or the momentum componants @xmath7 , while bob will observe the resulting interference pattern on the screen of l. just before her measurement , only alice knows what she will measure .",
    "we shall prove that quantum nonlocality implies that at @xmath8 bob can know what measurement alice has made .      at time @xmath3",
    "let the pure state of the entangled epr pairs be described by the wavefunction : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , the subscripts @xmath11 and @xmath12 refer to the particles in ensembles a and b , respectively , @xmath13 is the alice - bob spatial seperation , and @xmath14 is momentum . at time",
    "@xmath3 , alice has the choice of making either a transverse position or momentum measurement on the particles in a. the corresponding operators are @xmath1 and @xmath15 .",
    "if alice measures the momentum , then a photon in a is collapsed to a momentum eigenstate : @xmath16p_y + [ x_0 - x_b]p_x)}dp_y =    \\hbar\\delta ( y - y_b + y_0)e^{(2\\pi i/\\hbar ) ( x_0 - x_b)p_x } { \\end{equation}}this represents a monochromatic photon wave in b moving with momentum $ -{\\bf p}^{\\prime}$   being transversely localized at $ y_b = y + y_0$. given that the wave   represented by eq .",
    "( \\ref{eigenpos2 } ) moves perpendicular to the double slit plane , it can not be deselected by bob 's directional filter .",
    "provided $ y + y_0 $ falls within the area of lens 1 in figure \\ref{bm } , it passes to the spectral filter .",
    "if its frequency falls within the allowed narrowband , it is incident upon the double slit diaphragm .",
    "since spectral filters restrict only longitudinal frequency , the localization of the eigenstate ( \\ref{eigenpos2 } ) in the transverse direction is not affected by the filter .",
    "being localized in the transverse direction , photon b can pass through at most one slit .",
    "each photon b diffracts through one slit or the other in l and does not self - interfere . because of the low spectral and   angular uncertainty of the incident rays , the resulting single slit pattern is observable in the single counts . furthermore , according to the chronology of the alice - bob measurement and assuming that k is arbitrarily large , all of bob 's hits are coincidences corresponding to a restricted transverse localization of photons in k. this ensures high visibility in the pattern observed by bob .    the wavefunction behind the double slit subsequent to alice 's position measurement is:- $ \\psi(x_b , y_b ) = \\psi_1(x_b , y_b)$ or $ \\psi_2(x_b , y_b)$ , where $ \\psi_i$ is now the wavefunction of a particle localized at   slit~$i$ to spread out therefrom .",
    "the intensity pattern on the screen will be determined by the classical addition of probabilities : \\begin{subeqnarray } \\slabel{x1 } i(y ) & \\propto & |\\psi_1|^2 + |\\psi_2|^2 \\\\ \\slabel{x2 }       & \\approx &   { \\rm sinc}^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi apy}{\\hbar d}\\right ) .",
    "\\end{subeqnarray } this single slit diffraction pattern   in contrast to the diffraction - interference pattern of eq .",
    "( \\ref{p2 } ) .",
    "we note that the inequality of the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( \\ref{p1 } ) and ( \\ref{x1 } ) lies at the heart of the difference in bob 's observed patterns .",
    "the ensembles a and b are assumed to be sufficiently large that a finite number of photons will be found in l after bob 's measurement . depending on whether alice chooses to measure $ ( p_x , y)_a$ or $ ( p_x , p_y)_a$",
    ", she induces a single - slit diffraction pattern or a young 's double - slit pattern on bob 's screen , respectively .",
    "conversely , based on his observation of the interference pattern , bob instantaneously can know what quantity   alice has just measured .",
    "thus she is able to transmit a classical binary signal which bob unambiguously interprets .",
    "the effective   speed of the signal is $ { \\bf v}_{\\rm eff } = { \\bf x}_0/\\delta t$ , which can be   made arbitrarily large by increasing $ { \\bf x}_0 $ and decreasing $ \\delta t$. nonlocality allows $ { \\bf v}_{\\rm eff}$ to exceed $ c$ , since the wavefunction is postulated to collapse instantaneously at all points in space .",
    "a possible practical realization of this idealized superluminal quantum telegraph is discussed in section \\ref{sqt}.     \\section{on circumventing no - signalling proofs }    the no - signalling proofs   mentioned in the introduction would prevent bob from extracting a   classical signal if he makes a momentum or position measurement { \\it before } processing the b ensemble through the directional and spectral filters , and the double slit .",
    "the processing is such that a transverse position state is transformed to   a particle spreading out from one slit or the other and does not self - interfere , while the momentum state is   transformed to a monochromatic wave spreading from both slits that eventually self - interferes . as a result",
    ", the subsequent evolution of the position and momentum states beyond the double slit can not be represented by the same evolutionary operator .",
    "but for this , the indistinguishability of the two mixed states resulting from alice 's position or momentum measurment would be merely carried over to a new eigenbasis representation .",
    "let us consider a simplified situation in which position and momentum are two - valued in the entangled state .",
    "the particles a and b can exist in two possible transverse momentum componant eigenstates   $ |p_j\\rangle$ ( $ j$ = { \\rm q , r } ) . alternatively the two position   eigenstates are $ |y_i\\rangle$ ( $ i = 1 , 2)$ , corresponding to a particle being found at slit $ i$. in a momentum eigenstate the particle passes through   both slits .",
    "the entangled state in which the particles are assumed to   exist before alice 's measurement is : \\begin{subeqnarray } \\psi_{1,2 }      & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|p_{\\rm q}\\rangle|p_{\\rm r}\\rangle -          |p_{\\rm r}\\rangle|p_{\\rm q}\\rangle ) \\\\     & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|y_1\\rangle|y_2\\rangle - |y_2\\rangle|y_1\\rangle ) , \\end{subeqnarray } wherein the first eigenket in each product pair refers to an a photon , the second to a b one .",
    "the transformation from momentum to position basis is assumed to be given by : \\begin{subeqnarray } \\label{transform }     \\end{subeqnarray } the no - signaling argument can be expressed by the fact that the reduced density   operator $ { \\cal d}_p$ for bob 's particles subsequent to alice making   a momentum measurement is indistinguishable from the reduced density operator $ { \\cal d}_y$ for bob 's particles subsequent to her making a position measurement , as seen from : \\begin{subeqnarray } { \\cal d}_p & \\equiv & \\frac{1}{2}(|p_{\\rm q}\\rangle\\langle",
    "p_{\\rm q}| +         |p_{\\rm r}\\rangle\\langle p_{\\rm r}|)\\\\      & = & \\frac{1}{2}(|y_1\\rangle\\langle y_1| + |y_2\\rangle\\langle y_2|)\\\\      & \\equiv & { \\cal d}_y \\end{subeqnarray } this shows that bob can not know whether alice made a position or   momentum measurement by observing the b photons directly ( i.e , before they   pass filters and double slit ) .",
    "to simplifiy the post - double - slit scenario , we once again associate a   two - valuedness for the wavefunction spreading from the slits .",

    "<S> we propose a thought experiment for classical superluminal signal transmission based on the quantum nonlocal influence of photons on their momentum entangled epr twins . </S>",
    "<S> the signal sender measures either position or momentum of particles in a pure ensemble of the entangled pairs , leaving their twins as localized particles or plane waves . </S>",
    "<S> the signal receiver distinguishes these outcomes interferometrically using a double slit interferometer modified by a system of optical filters . </S>",
    "<S> since the collapse of the wavefunction is postulated to be instantaneous , this signal can be transmitted superluminally . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the method circumvents the no - signalling theorem because the receiver is able to modify the disentangled wavefunction before his measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a plan for the possible practical realization of a superluminal quantum telegraph based on the thought experiment . </S>"
