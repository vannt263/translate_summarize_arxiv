    "this , together with the results of inelastic neutron scattering @xcite and nmr @xcite experiments , led to the suggestion that some concurrent , non superconducting , order exists at the vortex cores when the superconducting order parameter is suppressed @xcite .",
    "the idea received direct support from stm spectroscopy@xcite where a periodic modulation of the local density of electronic states around the vortex cores was observed .",
    "since the decay length of this modulation is much longer than the superconducting coherence length , not only the structure of the core , but also the structure of the flow field for vortex transport should be different from conventional abrikosov vortices with probable consequences for the velocity - force relation .",

    "the behavior of the characteristic currents @xmath69 and @xmath70 further corroborates the similarities of the dissipation mechanisms close to threshold and in the high - current limit . the similarity is again underlined by the same @xmath71 field dependence for both quantities in the low temperature region .",
    "all these observations suggest that the same mechanism is responsible for the dissipation in the vicinity of the threshold current as in the high - current limit .",
    "the similarity of behavior is attributed to the way in which the resistive front propagates from the current contacts towards the middle of the sample as the current is increased@xcite .",
    "the current distribution reaches the resistive limit characterised by @xmath62 only after the two resistive fronts meet .",
    "as described earlier@xcite at low temperature there is a difference between field cooled ( fc ) and zero field cooled ( zfc ) preparation .",
    "the zfc data for both @xmath69 and @xmath70 exhibit a characteristic peak at the same line in the @xmath72 plane which defines a low temperature region where the fc prepared state is only metastable .",

    "( [ eq : bs ] ) , ranging from a @xmath84 like variation at low field to a saturation value for the low temperature vortex solid phase .",
    "nonetheless there is a trend that with increasing temperature , in the vortex liquid phase , the saturation feature disappears , at least for the field values accessible to us . in the solid phase at low temperatures",
    "there is strictly no field dependence of @xmath62 whatsoever above about 1 t although as mentioned above its value is in good agreement with the linear extrapolation to @xmath85 of the normal resistance measured above @xmath26 .",
    "since the field where saturation occurs is in the order of @xmath86 , it might appear that for fields below saturation , the vortices move @xmath87 times faster than expected , or that the vortex friction coefficient is @xmath87 smaller , from a simple application of the bs relation .",
    "the experiment measures resistance and the ratio of resistances is only proportional to the ratio of resistivities if the current distributions are identical .",
    "this is not the case in anisotropic materials like bscco where the current penetration depth is determined by the anisotropy of the resistivity .",
    "the latter is not only different in the superconducting state but is also field dependent . from this point of view",
    "we might interpret the comparison made in fig .",
    "[ fig : rperrn ] as an indication that the current penetration is considerably less in the low temperature vortex solid phase , progressively approaching the normal phase penetration depth at higher temperatures in the vortex liquid phase . indeed in the liquid phase ,",

    "we could suppose that well into the ohmic response regime the current is distributed as for a normal anisotropic ohmic conductor@xcite , a surmise which is borne out by numerical simulations based on the superconductor model of ref.@xcite .",

    "it is difficult to conclude that the bs relation is untrue , either by a multiplicative factor or in its form . to determine the multiplicative factor requires a good way of estimating the normal resistivities in the superconducting phase",
    "also , because the agreement is reasonably good at high temperature and the vortex entity is not expected to change nature from high to low temperature , the serious disagreement at low temperature is much more likely to be related to the nature of the solid phase as the bs relation is a single vortex property .",
    "it can however be concluded from the sublinear , approximately @xmath67 , field dependence that if the linear field dependence of the bs relation is correct , the current distribution is not constant and its penetration depth is controlled by the resistive anisotropy and thus by @xmath16 .",
