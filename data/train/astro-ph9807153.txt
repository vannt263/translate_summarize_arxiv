    "the present paper is part of a series presenting the data accumulated by the public eso imaging survey ( eis ) being carried out in preparation for the first year of regular operation of the vlt .",
    "as described in previous papers ( renzini & da costa 1997 , nonino 1998 , hereafter paper i ) the main science goal of eis is the search for rare objects such as clusters of galaxies , spanning a broad redshift range , quasars at intermediate and high redshifts , high - redshift galaxies and stars with special characteristics ( white dwarfs , very low mass stars , brown dwarfs ) .",
    "these goals have guided the adopted survey strategy which , for eis - wide , envisioned observations in @xmath6 and @xmath1 to search for clusters and in four passbands ( @xmath7 ) over @xmath8 square degrees in a region near the south galactic pole ( eis - wide patch b ) .",
    "the observations in @xmath0 and @xmath1 have already been completed , while observations in the @xmath9-band are expected to be carried out in the fall of 1998 .",
    "one of the main motivations for the multicolor survey has been the identification of a large number of close line - of - sight , intermediate redshift qsos to study the three - dimensional distribution of absorbers , using medium and high - resolution spectrographs ( uves ) at the vlt . for this reason , a region near the sgp ,",
    "where several qsos are known from previous studies , has been selected",
    ". however , the data are also useful for galactic studies and for the identification of rare stellar populations , with the survey having a unique combination of depth and area coverage .",
    "the additional @xmath6-band images , which altogether overlap the @xmath1 images over @xmath10 70% of the surveyed area in patches a and b ( 15% of the whole eis - wide ) , are also useful in the search of galaxy clusters ( olsen 1998 , paper  v ) . finally , it is important to emphasize that the present data offer an excellent opportunity to assess the complexity of efficiently handling large volumes of multicolor data and extracting useful target lists .",
    "this is a key element for the exploration of the full range of science offered by the multicolor surveys envisioned for the new wide - field camera ( wfi@2.2 m ) at the eso / mpia 2.2 m telescope at la silla .    in section 2 ,",
    "the observations are described and the characteristics of the multicolor data are presented .",
    "this section also presents the extracted object catalogs and discusses their completeness and reliability . in section  3",
    "the catalogs are evaluated by comparison with models and other data .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in section  4 .",
    "the observations of patch b were carried out over several months in the period july 1997 to december 1997 , using the red channel of the emmi camera on the 3.5 m new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla .",
    "the red channel of emmi is equipped with a tektronix 2046 @xmath11 2046 chip with a pixel size of 0.266 arcsec and a useful field - of - view of about @xmath12 .",
    "eis uses a special set of bvi filters and the response function of the system can be found in paper  i.    as described in paper i , the observations were carried out by a sequence of overlapping exposures ( hereafter refer to as even / odd frames ) 150 sec each , with each position on the sky being sampled at least twice .",
    "a total of 701 frames were obtained in the area with 200 in @xmath13 , 282 in v and 219 in i bands .",
    "only 150 frames in each band were required to cover the field but poor weather conditions required several frames to be re - observed .",
    "the strong variations in the observing conditions can be seen in figure  [ fig : seeinghistall ] which shows , for each band , the seeing distribution of all observed frames . for comparison",
    "the shaded histograms show the seeing distribution of the frames finally accepted , with the solid vertical line in each panel indicating the median seeing for each band .",
    "the @xmath13-band is the worst overall with a median seeing of 1.2 arcsec and with a few frames extending to very large seeing ( @xmath14 arcsec ) . in the analysis below 9 frames with seeing @xmath15 arcsec",
    "were discarded because of their incompleteness at faint magnitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig : mlim ] shows , again for each band , the @xmath16 limiting isophote within 1 arcsec .",
    "the transparency of the nights also showed significant variations especially for the @xmath1-band images , with one frame reaching 21  mag / arcsec@xmath17 ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "for this frame , which was removed from analysis , the depth reached is considerably shallower than the remaining frames leading not only to a bright limiting magnitude but also to the detection of a significant number of spurious objects .",
    "other frames with bright limiting isophotes have no significant impact in the analysis presented in section  [ analysis ] .",
    "figures  [ fig:2dseeing ] and  [ fig:2dmlim ] show , for each band , the two - dimensional distribution of the seeing and limiting isophote as determined from the even frames .",
    "similar results are obtained for the odd frames which alternate with the even ones .",
    "such maps allow the potential user of the derived catalogs to evaluate their reliability .",
    "the final data is reasonably homogeneous with the median seeing in all bands @xmath18 arcsec .",
    "however , some poor images do exist and for some applications must be removed , as discussed above .",
    "the area that is affected is @xmath19 square degree .    finally , it is worth mentioning that since the completion of paper  i , the @xmath6 images for patch  a over an area @xmath20 square degrees have also been reduced and are being made available together with the catalogs extracted from them which are used below .",
    "the data were processed by the eis pipeline being developed to handle large imaging programs and described in detail in paper i. the software development is still in progress with new functionalities being constantly added to the pipeline as well as enhanced features in skycat driven by the survey needs , in particular to facilitate the visual inspection of the target lists being produced . in addition , new tools are being developed to handle color information , which adds a new level of complexity especially in the preparation of object catalogs .",
    "computation of colors require reliable association of objects detected in different passbands , which may be affected by the seeing , astrometric errors , the morphology of the objects and the performance of the de - blending algorithm .",
    "one also needs a proper definition for the measurement of colors for faint sources and upper limits for non - detections .",
    "currently , preliminary color catalogs are being produced only for point - sources , which are being systematically inspected to verify the catalogs and identify any peculiarities ( zaggia 1998 ) .",
    "this is an important first step towards the preparation of the final color catalog for patch b. for instance , during the visual inspection of objects selected by their peculiar colors , it became evident that ghost images , observed near relatively bright stars in the @xmath13 and @xmath6 images , contaminate the catalogs .      using all the standard stars observations carried out in photometric nights at the ntt with the eis filters , in the period july 1997-march 1998 , the color transformation between the eis and",
    "the johnson - cousins systems has been determined . in figure",
    "[ fig : color ] the observed transformations for all the three bands are shown , as a function of color in the johnson - cousins system .",
    "the fits are given by the relations :    @xmath21    note that the transformation given here for @xmath22 is slightly different from that determined in paper i. this is because more standards have been included since and a more careful pruning of the data has been performed .",
    "the determination of color corrections include 284 measurements in b , 255 in v and 209 in i , with the formal errors in the color terms estimated to be @xmath23 0.02 mag in all three bands . in general , the color term is small except for the b - band . in this case",
    "the data also suggests a possible departure from linearity at the red end . as a final note",
    ", it is worth mentioning that in the process of examining all the standard stars observations , errors in positions and the presence of variable stars in the landolt lists were found .",
    "a complete list of these problems will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the photometric calibration of the patch was carried out by first bringing all frames to a common zero - point as determined from the relative magnitudes of objects in overlap regions , within a pre - selected magnitude range .",
    "this was done by a global least - square fit to all the relative zero - points , constraining their sum to be equal to zero .",
    "the internal accuracy of the derived photometric solution is @xmath24 mag ( paper  i ) .",
    "second , absolute zero - points are found for frames observed in photometric conditions .",
    "the zero - points for these frames were determined using a total of 36 frames of 7 fields containing standard stars taken from landolt ( 1992 a , b ) , observed over 5 nights .",
    "these frames were also reduced through the pipeline , which identified the standard stars and measured magnitudes through landolt apertures automatically ( see paper  i ) . altogether",
    "148 independent measurements of standards were used in the calibration .",
    "two solutions are then determined : one which computes a single zero - point offset , based on the weighted average of the zero - points of the calibrated frames , and the other using a first - order polynomial in both right ascension and declination .",
    "comparison with external data suggests that a zero - point offset provides an adequate photometric calibration for the entire patch .",
    "external photometric data come from the dutch 0.9 m telescope at la silla and from overlaps with denis data and with frames taken by lidman & peterson ( 1996 ) .",
    "the regions of overlap of these data are shown in figure  [ fig : overlaps ] . in the figure",
    "the regions observed under photometric conditions are also indicated .",
    "comparison of this figure with its counterpart in paper i , demonstrates that the data for patch b is clearly of superior quality with a much larger fraction of frames taken under photometric conditions .",
    "comparison with these external data is important in order to look for possible gradients in the photometric zero - point , introduced by the relative photometry which implicitly assumes that there are no systematic errors in the flatfield from frame to frame .      during the processing of a patch through the pipeline ,",
    "object catalogs extracted from single frames are merged together into a `` patch '' catalog for each passband .",
    "this is the parent catalog which consists of multiple entries of objects detected in overlapping frames . for each detection , the seeing and noise of the frame in which the object was found",
    "is also stored .",
    "the parent catalog is used to derive different types of single - entry catalogs detected from 150  sec exposures such as the odd / even catalogs described in paper  i. alternatively , it has also been used to derive a unique catalog defined by examining the characteristics of the frames where a given object was detected , saving only the entry associated with the best seeing frame .",
    "details regarding the methodology of association will be described elsewhere ( deul 1998 ) . from the flag information available in the single - entry catalog ,",
    "_ filtered _ catalogs have been produced for analysis purposes .",
    "the filtering is required in order to eliminate truncated objects and objects with a significant number of pixels affected by cosmics and/or other artifacts .",
    "the parameters adopted in the filtering are the same as those given in paper  i.    in general , this single - entry patch - wide catalog is the one used below , while the odd / even are used to estimate the magnitude errors directly from the data , by cross - identifying the objects . for point - like sources",
    ", a preliminary attempt has also been made to produce a color catalog combining the information of the catalogs derived from each passband .",
    "using the same association scheme mentioned above , a cross - identification of objects is made and colors are computed using the mag_auto estimator of sextractor ( paper  i ) which should be adequate for point sources . for non - detections in a given band , 1@xmath25 limiting magnitudes are computed from the seeing and noise properties of the best seeing frame available at the expected position of the object .",
    "even though still rudimentary , this derived catalog serves for verification purposes and for a first cut analysis of the data .",
    "the final color catalog will only be derived from the co - added images . in this case",
    ", colors will be computed using the detection area in each band as determined from the limiting isophote defined either in one band ( @xmath1 ) or the summed images of different bands ( @xmath26 ) . even though the required software is available it",
    "is only now being integrated into the pipeline .",
    "it is important to emphasize the complexity of handling and merging information extracted from different passbands .",
    "for instance , each object may have a different sextractor stellarity - index which may impact the galaxy / star classification , close pairs may be de - blended in one passband and not in another , depending on the seeing",
    ". clearly a complete description of all the possible pitfalls and the overall performance of the software is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the current work also shows the shortcomings of handling catalogs and points out the need for the implementation of an object database with a flexible user interface to allow for the full exploration of the data by different groups .",
    "for the purposes of the present paper galaxies are objects with stellarity index @xmath27 if brighter than the star / galaxy classification limit ( @xmath13=22 , @xmath6=22 , @xmath1=21 ) or any object , regardless of the stellarity index , fainter than this limit .",
    "stars are objects with stellarity index @xmath28 .",
    "note that this definition leads to some cross - contamination but it has no significant impact on the conclusions . in evaluating the data in section  [ analysis ] the derived star and galaxy catalogs",
    "were , for simplicity , trimmed at the edges and the bad frames discussed above were removed .",
    "after trimming the areas covered are : 1.3 , 1.4 and 1.37 square degrees in @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding two - dimensional distributions of stars , down to the star / galaxy classification limits , and galaxies , down to estimated 80% completeness limits , are shown in figure  [ fig : proj_dist ] .",
    "the total number of objects in these plots are : 2290 stars brighter than @xmath30 and 33133 galaxies brighter than @xmath31 ; 3378 stars brighter than @xmath32 and 58590 galaxies brighter than @xmath33 ; and 4297 stars and 44546 galaxies brighter than @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "recall that the distribution shown is for the `` best '' catalog . if one wishes to work with the odd",
    "/ even catalogs their distribution have to be examined in the same way . in order to avoid extraneous colors due to bad data in one or more bands ,",
    "the color catalog examined in section  [ analysis ] corresponds to the common areas covered in the different passbands and has a total area of 1.27 square degrees .      as in paper",
    "i , the completeness of the derived catalogs has been established by using a single field where several exposures have been made over the period of observations of patch b. the corresponding catalogs in each passband were then compared with that of a typical frame with an exposure time of 150  sec . a total of 9 exposures in b band , 6 exposures in v band and 8 in i band , were selected discarding others taken in less favorable conditions .",
    "these exposures were coadded and the derived catalogs are at least one magnitude deeper than the typical survey frame . comparing the identified objects in a single exposure frame with those extracted from the co - added images one can derive the expected completeness for typical 150 sec survey frames .",
    "the results of these comparisons are shown in figure  [ fig : completeness ] showing that the catalogs are 80% complete at @xmath2 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "these limits should apply for survey frames with a seeing close to the median seeing .",
    "also shown in the figure is the number of false positives computed from the fraction of objects identified in the single exposure frames which were not detected in the co - added image .    in order to estimate the accuracy of the magnitudes",
    "the odd and even catalogs were compared and a lower limit estimate of the photometric errors can be obtained from the repeatability of the magnitudes for paired objects .",
    "the estimated errors from this comparison are given in figure  [ fig : errors ] , which shows that in the interval @xmath38 they range from 0.02 to 0.1 mag , reaching 0.3 mag at @xmath39 .",
    "similar values are found for @xmath13 and @xmath6 brighter than @xmath40 .",
    "these values correspond well to those estimated from sextractor .",
    "it is also of interest to obtain a completely independent estimate of the errors in the magnitudes .",
    "this can be done by comparing the objects detected by eis with those found by lidman & peterson ( 1996 ) , who have used a different object detection algorithm .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : lidman ] where the objects detected in two separate fields ( see figure  [ fig : overlaps ] ) , with 1354 and 1299 objects each , are compared .",
    "note that because of differences in the astrometry this comparison was done using the astrometric solution found by the eis pipeline but the magnitudes as determined in the original catalog . even adopting this procedure misidentifications",
    "are still present , leading to significant magnitude differences over the entire magnitude range . nevertheless , the zero - point offset is typically @xmath10 0.05  mag for @xmath41 , consistent with the zero - point correction proposed by these authors to bring their measurements into the johnson - cousins system . beyond this limit ,",
    "the lidman & peterson catalog becomes increasingly incomplete leading to a biased offset .",
    "the scatter in this comparison is less than 0.3 mag down to @xmath42 , consistent with our internal estimates if one attributes comparable errors to the lidman & peterson measurements .",
    "the zero - point offset and the scatter of the magnitude differences is the same for the two fields considered , suggesting that there are no strong gradients in the photometric zero - point of the patch , at least on a 0.5 degree scale , corresponding to the separation of the two lidman & peterson fields .    in order to further investigate possible systematic errors in the photometric zero - point over the scale of the patch ,",
    "the eis catalogs were also compared with object catalogs extracted from the two denis strips that cross the survey region ( see figure  [ fig : overlaps ] ) .",
    "this allows one to investigate the variation of the zero - point as a function of right ascension and , especially of declination .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : denis ] .",
    "the domain in which the comparison can be made is relatively small because of saturation of objects in eis at the bright end ( @xmath43 ) and the shallow magnitude limit of denis ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "still , within the two magnitudes where comparison is possible one finds a roughly constant zero - point offset of less than 0.02  mag for both strips and a scatter that can be attributed to the errors in the denis magnitudes ( deul 1998 ) .",
    "finally , similar comparisons can be made between the eis magnitudes and those measured from the images obtained at the 0.9 m dutch telescope at la silla , in this case , for all three passbands .",
    "figure  [ fig : dutch ] shows these comparisons , combining all the three fields that overlap patch  b. even though the total number of objects is relatively small ( 112 in @xmath13 , 180 in @xmath6 and 204 in @xmath1 ) preventing an accurate comparison , one finds a reasonable agreement in the zero - point and a scatter that can be accounted by magnitudes errors in the dutch data ( @xmath45 at @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "the observed zero - point offset between the dutch and eis data ( @xmath49 in @xmath13 , @xmath23 0.1 in @xmath6 , @xmath50 in @xmath1 ) can be explained by the color term corrections required for the eis and dutch measurements to bring both measurements into the cousins system .",
    "as the fields are well separated in right ascension , this result gives further evidence that there are no significant gradients in the photometric zero - point in any of the passbands .    in summary , comparison of the eis magnitudes with available external data shows no indication of gradients in the photometric zero - point of the patch",
    "although this paper does not intend to interpret the data , some basic statistics are computed to evaluate the overall performance of the eis pipeline in translating images into useful scientific products . for this purpose ,",
    "the stellar and galaxy samples extracted in each passband and the preliminary color catalog for point - sources are compared below with other available data and model predictions .",
    "figure  [ fig : star_counts ] , shows the comparison of the star counts for patch b derived using the stellar sample extracted from the object catalogs produced in each passband ( section  [ cats ] ) , with the predicted counts based on a galactic model composed of an old - disk , a thick disk and a halo .",
    "the star- and color - counts presented in this section have been computed using the model described by mndez and van altena ( 1996 ) , using the standard parameters described in their table  1 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that no attempt has been made to fit any of the model parameters to the observed counts .",
    "the model is used solely as a guide to evaluate the data and , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : star_counts ] one finds a remarkable agreement with the predicted counts down to the magnitude where the star - galaxy separation is expected to become unreliable .",
    "the excess in counts seen at the bright end is due to the saturation of brighter objects ( @xmath51 ) .    using the preliminary color catalog for point sources the observed color distribution of stars brighter than @xmath52",
    "is compared to model predictions in figure  [ fig : colorbin ] over three ranges of magnitude as indicated in each panel .",
    "the model computes starcounts in @xmath0 and @xmath1 by adopting a series of color - magnitude diagrams appropriate for the disk , thick - disk and halo of our galaxy . in order",
    "to output predicted counts in the natural passbands of the eis survey , the transformation given by equations ( 1)-(4 ) have been used to convert from the eis magnitudes to the johnson - cousins system in such a way that the predicted counts are actually evaluated in the eis passbands and are convolved using the error model given in figure  [ fig : errors ] .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : color ] , the number of red ( @xmath53 ) standard stars defining the color transformation is very small , so that one might expect possible discrepancies between the observed and predicted counts , particularly for redder colors .",
    "one way of overcoming this would be to use synthetic star colors using the system response functions given in paper  i. however , for the purposes of describing the usefulness of the data , the current calibration is sufficient . considering that none of the model parameters have been adjusted to fit the present data , the good agreement of the model to the observed counts in both @xmath54 and @xmath55 is remarkable , although some discrepancies can also be readily seen .    at the brightest magnitude bin one sees a deficit of red objects relative to the model predictions in both ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath55 , especially in the former , which is due to saturation effects .",
    "note that objects with saturated pixels have been discarded from the color catalog .    in the range @xmath57 , the color - counts are known to split into two major peaks , each sampling a different stellar population ( bahcall 1986 ) .",
    "the blue peak at @xmath58 is due to halo stars near the turnoff ( @xmath59 ) , located at few kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "the red peak at @xmath60 is due to faint m - dwarf stars from the disk , located at less than 1  kpc from the sun .",
    "note the small relative offset ( @xmath61  mag ) between the observed and predicted location of the red peak .",
    "as pointed out above this may be due to , and is consistent with , the departure of the color term from the linear correction adopted for objects with @xmath53 .",
    "note that the agreement is much better in @xmath55 for which the contribution from color terms are expected to be negligible .    traditionally , the observed splitting in the color peaks has been used to determine the local normalization of halo stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "note in this context the difference in the amplitude of the counts in the blue peak in the magnitude range @xmath62 , which is seen in both @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "most photometric surveys at faint magnitudes ( reid and majewski 1993 ) have relied on pencil - beam surveys covering a small fraction of a degree .",
    "therefore , the number of observed objects per bin has been very small , leading to large uncertainties in the derived model parameters .",
    "the eis sample , covering @xmath63 square degrees , represents a significant improvement and may allow for a better determination of these parameters .",
    "finally , it is interesting to point out the existence of a population of blue objects , in particular , the suggestion of a peak at @xmath64 observed at faint magnitudes ( 20@xmath65 ) .",
    "this peak does not match the location and the amplitude of the peak predicted by the white dwarf population assumed in the model .",
    "instead the observed blue objects could consist of a mix of white dwarfs , blue horizontal branch stars or perhaps halo field blue stragglers .",
    "further investigation on the nature of these objects seems worthwhile .",
    "the results demonstrate that the stellar color catalog being produced is by and large consistent with model predictions and the observed differences may possibly point to deficiencies in the model which should be further investigated by interested groups .",
    "although primarily driven by other goals , the above discussion shows that the eis data is also useful for galatic studies .      in order to evaluate the quality and the depth of the galaxy samples , galaxy counts in the different passbands",
    "are shown in figure  [ ncounts_gal ] and compared to those determined for patch  a and by other authors as indicated in the figure caption . in these comparisons",
    "the @xmath1 magnitudes of lidman & peterson ( 1996 ) have been shifted by + 0.04  mag and those measured by postman ( 1996 ) by -0.43  mag to bring them into the johnson - cousins system . a small correction ( -0.02  mag )",
    "has also been applied to the @xmath6 counts of postman .",
    "no corrections were made to the arnouts ( 1997 ) data .",
    "as can be seen there is a remarkable agreement between the eis counts and those obtained by other authors .",
    "they are also consistent with the counts determined from patch a , down to @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "as emphasized in paper  i even for single exposures eis reaches fainter magnitudes than previous data used for cluster searches .",
    "the overall uniformity of the eis galaxy catalogs can be examined using the two - point angular correlation function , @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , @xmath68 is a very efficient tool for detecting any kind of artificial patterns ( such as a grid with scale comparable to an emmi frame ) or possible gradients in the density over the field ( which could result from large - scale gradients of the photometric zero - point ) .",
    "departures from uniformity should affect the correlation function especially at faint magnitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig : w ] shows @xmath68 obtained for each of the three passbands @xmath69 and @xmath1 , using the estimator proposed by landy & szalay ( 1993 ) .",
    "the calculation has been done over the area defined above ( see figure  [ fig : proj_dist ] ) .",
    "the error bars are @xmath16 errors calculated from ten bootstrap realizations .",
    "the angular correlation function is , in general , well described by a power law @xmath70 for angular scales extending out to @xmath71 degrees , with a value of @xmath72 in the range 0.7 - 0.8 . the absence of any strong feature at the scale of the individual survey frame should be noted .",
    "furthermore , no significant variations of the slope are detected , except at the bright end in all the three passbands . in this case",
    "@xmath68 is somewhat flatter than at fainter magnitudes .",
    "a possible explanation is the presence of the nearby cluster ( aco s84 ) at @xmath73 located near the center of the patch . to test this hypothesis",
    "the correlation function was recomputed by discarding a square region of about 0.2 degrees on the side centered at the nominal position of the cluster . using the pruned sample yields a steeper correlation function for the patch , consistent with the expected slope of 0.8 .",
    "these results show the uniformity of the eis catalogs , once obviously bad frames , selected on the basis of seeing and limiting isophote , are discarded .",
    "the angular correlation function can also be used to verify the consistency of the photometric zero - points determined for patches a and b. this can be done by studying the amplitude of the angular correlation function as a function of limiting magnitude and comparing the results obtained for the two patches .",
    "figure  [ fig : aw ] shows the amplitude of the angular correlation function at a scale of 1  arcmin , @xmath74 , as a function of the limiting magnitude in the different passbands .",
    "this amplitude is calculated from the best linear - fits over the range @xmath10 10 - 200 arcsec of @xmath68 shown in figure  [ fig : w ] . for @xmath6 and @xmath1 one finds good agreement between the results for the two patches especially at the faint end .",
    "the differences seen in the bright end are fully accounted for by the presence of the nearby cluster described above .",
    "the plot shows the amplitude of the correlation with and without the cluster .",
    "as can be seen once the cluster is removed , the amplitude at the bright end decreases and shows a good agreement with the estimate from patch a. similarly , one finds good agreement with the results obtained by other authors such as : in the b band , roche et al . (",
    "1993 ) ( @xmath75 ) and jones et al .",
    "( 1987 ) ( @xmath76 ) ; in the v band , woods & fahlman ( 1997 ) ( v=24 ) ; and in the i band , postman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the angular correlation function as determined from the eis galaxy catalogs are consistent with those obtained by various authors over the entire range of magnitude .",
    "note that at for @xmath78 the eis points lie slightly below those recently computed by postman ( 1998 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the above results are further evidence that the eis galaxy catalogs are uniform within a patch , that the zero - points for the different patches are consistent and are in good agreement with external data .",
    "in this paper multicolor data for patch b covering about 1.7 square degrees near the sgp have been presented .",
    "the quality of single band and color catalogs have been assessed by comparisons of basic statistics such as number counts , color distribution , and angular correlation function , with model predictions and results from other authors .",
    "the results indicate that the eis object catalogs are suitable for the science goals of the survey leading to consistent results when compared to other data .",
    "furthermore , one finds good agreement between the results derived from the catalogs extracted from patches a and b.    the work being carried out is essential in the preparation of the final release of the eis data .",
    "while the production of single - frame catalogs is straightforward , the preparation of a catalog covering the whole patch requires some experimentation in order to fine - tune the parameters and verify its uniformity , completeness , and reliability .",
    "multicolor data adds to the complexity of the task of catalog production and further work in the preparation of well understood color catalogs is required .",
    "the experience gained so far points out the need for a sustained effort in the development of techniques and tools which will allow for : 1 ) the production of more customized catalogs for different science goals , essential for public surveys ; 2 ) the exploration of the multi - dimensional space offered by multicolor data ; 3 ) the cross - correlation of the detected objects with the increasing number of databases available in different wavelengths .",
    "searches in this multi - dimensional space offer unique science opportunities and the implementation of suitable tools for its exploration represent a major challenge for the efficient use of imaging surveys carried out with the specific purpose of producing targets to feed 8-m class telescopes .",
    "the full range of products for patch a and b in the form of astrometric and photometric calibrated pixel maps , object catalogs , candidate target lists and on - line co - added section images can be found at `` http://www.eso.org/eis/eis_release.html '' .",
    "new products will be added incrementally as they become avaialble .",
    "further information on the project are available on the world wide web at `` http://www.eso.org/eis '' .",
    "we thank all the people directly or indirectly involved in the eso imaging survey effort . in particular , all the members of the eis working group for the innumerable suggestions and constructive criticisms , the eso archive group and st - ecf for their support .",
    "we also thank c. lidman for providing his images , zero - points and catalogs .",
    "we are also grateful to the denis consortium for making available some of their survey data .",
    "the denis project development was made possible thanks to the contributions of a number of researchers , engineers and technicians in various institutes .",
    "the denis project is supported by the science and human capital and mobility plans of the european commission under the grants ct920791 and ct940627 , by the french institut national des sciences de lunivers , the education ministry and the centre national de la recherche scientifique , in germany by the state of baden - wurttemberg , in spain by the dgicyt , in italy by the consiglio nazionale delle richerche , by the austrian fonds zur frderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung und bundesministerium fr wissenschaft und forschung , in brazil by the fundation for the development of scientific research of the state of so paulo ( fapesp ) , and by the hungarian otka grants f-4239 and f-013990 and the eso c & ee grant a-04 - 046 . our special thanks to a. renzini , vlt programme scientist , for his scientific input , support and dedication in making this project a success .",
    "finally , we would like to thank eso s director general riccardo giacconi for making this effort possible ."

    "<S> this paper presents multicolor data obtained for a 1.7 square degree region near the south galactic pole ( patch  b ) as part of the eso imaging survey ( eis ) . </S>",
    "<S> so far the observations have been conducted in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but are expected to be complemented by observations in the u - band later in 1998 . </S>",
    "<S> object catalogs extracted from single exposure images are 80% complete down to @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and once co - added should reach about 0.5 mag deeper . </S>",
    "<S> the data are being made public in the form of catalogs , pixel maps , target lists and image `` postage stamps '' , which can be retrieved from the web . </S>",
    "<S> counts of stars and galaxies and the angular two - point correlation function of galaxies are computed and compared to other available data to evaluate the depth and uniformity of the extracted object catalogs . in addition , color distributions of stellar objects are presented and compared to model predictions to examine the reliability of the colors . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that the overall quality of the catalogs extracted from the images is good and suitable for the science goals of the survey .    </S>",
