    "the development of statistical mechanics based on ensemble theory is founded on the postulate of `` equal _ a priori _ probabilities '' , which is assumed to apply to all microstates consistent with the given macrostate of an isolated system @xcite .",
    "the corresponding statistical ensemble is the so - called microcanonical ensemble .",
    "a representative system in this ensemble has all `` mechanical '' variables such as energy @xmath3 , volume @xmath4 , magnetization @xmath5 etc .",
    ", fixed . for convenience in calculations ,",
    "other ensembles are used which invariably suppose the existence of a subsidiary system or reservoir in contact with the actual system .",
    "for instance , in the canonical ensemble the walls of the system permit an exchange of energy with the reservoir while in the grand canonical ensemble , both energy and matter can be exchanged . in general , the different ensembles",
    "are constructed by allowing one or more mechanical variables to fluctuate .",
    "the exchange of each of these variables is controlled by a parameter which is a characteristic of the reservoir .",
    "for instance , in the case of the canonical ensemble , this parameter is precisely the temperature of the reservoir and determines the mean energy of the system . actually , this is adequate when the reservoir is a very large system that can exchange arbitrary amounts of energy , without modification of its intensive properties . in practical situations ,",
    "this is not always the case .",
    "however , very few studies have been devoted to analyse the consequences of possible deviations from these ideal reservoir properties .    in this paper",
    ", we develop the statistical mechanics of a system that can exchange energy with a finite reservoir characterized by two parameters : @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these parameters control independently the mean energy of the system and its energy fluctuations , respectively .",
    "the corresponding statistical ensemble represents a generalization of the canonical ensemble and will be called the extended gaussian ensemble ( ege ) .",
    "a similar ensemble was already developed , in a more restricted framework , by hetherington @xcite .",
    "the author considered that the sample system was in contact with a finite reservoir with size dependent properties .",
    "the so - called gaussian ensemble was introduced so that it is equivalent to the canonical ensemble in the limit of large systems , except in the energy range of a first - order transition .",
    "interestingly , it enables a smooth interpolation between the microcanonical and the canonical ensembles . taking into account these features , challa and",
    "hetherington @xcite showed the interest of this ensemble for monte carlo simulation studies of phase transitions .",
    "they demonstrated a significant reduction in computer time ( compared to standard simulations in the canonical ensemble ) and , its adequacy for distinguishing second - order from first - order transitions .",
    "compared to the ege introduced in the present paper , the main difference arises from the fact that in the gaussian ensemble the sample and the reservoir are assumed to be statistically independent which implies the additivity of the corresponding entropies .",
    "this is not assumed in our formalism .",
    "the consequences are important and will be discussed in depth in this work .",
    "the present formalism can be considered as an alternative to the statistical mechanics based on non - additive generalized entropies .",
    "actually the study of such generalized entropies has generated a lot of interest in the past fiveteen years .",
    "the motivation for the so called tsallis statistical mechanics has been to extend the standard boltzmann - gibbs framework to include non - extensive systems @xcite . among different interpretations",
    ", it has been suggested that tsallis formalism corresponds to an ensemble describing a system attached to a finite reservoir @xcite .",
    "although a large number of papers have been published , the physical meaning of many related issues is still open to discussion @xcite .",
    "the ege formalism that we propose in this paper , provides a clear and consistent framework for the statistical mechanics with a finite reservoir .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections [ contact ] and [ maxent ] , the ege is founded from the analysis of a contact with a finite reservoir and from the maximum statistical entropy principle respectively . in section [ thermo ] , the main thermodynamic relations are derived . in section [ nonadd ] ,",
    "we highlight the non - additive nature of the thermodynamic formalism . in section [ stabi ] , a stability criterion is proposed . in section [ qexp ] , the equilibrium distributions of the ege",
    "are compared with the @xmath2-exponential distributions . in section [ appli ] , we present an example of application to a system of independent spins .",
    "finally , in section [ concl ] we summarize and conclude .",
    "let us consider a system ( that we will call the sample ) in contact with a reservoir .",
    "let us call the energy of the sample @xmath6 and the energy of the reservoir @xmath7 .",
    "the sample and the reservoir together form an isolated system so that @xmath8 is constant .",
    "let us also define @xmath9 as the number of microstates of the reservoir . following callen @xcite , the probability that the system 1 is in a certain microstate with energy @xmath6 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total number of states available for the set @xmath12 ( note that we do not assume that @xmath13 can be factorized as a product @xmath14 ) .",
    "let us define the entropy of the reservoir as : @xmath15 ( all along the paper we choose the entropy units so that boltzmann s constant , @xmath16 . ) therefore : @xmath17 the energy of the sample will , in general fluctuate .",
    "let us call @xmath18 its mean ( equilibrium ) value .",
    "we can develop @xmath19 around the equilibrium value @xmath20 as : @xmath21 the derivatives in the right hand side of this expression are quantities which depend only on the reservoir .",
    "we define @xmath22 and @xmath23 the standard canonical ensemble is characterized by a reservoir with constant @xmath0 ( independent of @xmath7 ) , which implies @xmath24 and there is no term beyond the first order term in the eq .",

    "the thermodynamic meaning of these parameters will be clarified in the following sections . to explicitly highlight the effects of this modification and also for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the cubic and higher order terms vanish . then substituting ( [ expands2 ] ) in ( [ prob1 ] ) and denoting the energies of the microstates of the sample by @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , we obtain @xmath28 , \\label{piexp}\\ ] ] where the normalization constant @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 .",

    "( [ piexp ] ) , ( [ defzg ] ) and ( [ defu ] ) reduce to the standard canonical ensemble definitions when @xmath33 .",

    "in this section , we derive the probability law of eq .",
    "( [ piexp ] ) from different arguments .",
    "this leads to a better understanding of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 as parameters characterizing the `` equilibrium '' distribution of the sample . to derive the probability distribution from the maximum statistical entropy principle , we maximize the standard gibbs - boltzmann - shannon entropy given by @xmath34 subject to the constraints of normalisation of the probability , the given mean value of the energy and the fixed value of the fluctuations , respectively as @xmath35 then the maximization procedure is done by introducing the lagrange multipiers @xmath36 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the respective constraints , and maximizing the following functional @xmath37 : & = & -_i p_i p_i - ( _ i p_i -1 ) - ( _ i _ i p_i - u ) + & & - ( _",
    "i ( _ i -u)^2 p_i - w ) . by requiring the condition : @xmath38 it is easy to see that the optimum form of the probability distribution is given by the expression in eq .",
    "( [ piexp ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath0 and @xmath1 , within this context , are simply lagrange multipliers that allow to fix , self - consistently , a mean value of the energy @xmath39 and a specific value of the variance @xmath40 .",
    "we define a thermodynamic potential @xmath41 as @xmath42 by differentiating eq .",
    "( [ defzg ] ) , it can be straightforwardly obtained that : @xmath43 the second derivative renders : @xmath44 which represents a generalization of the standard formula for energy fluctuations in the canonical ensemble .",
    "it is natural to define the extended heat capacity as : @xmath45 this equation is the same that was already derived in ref .  .",
    "note that , contrary to what happens in the standard canonical ensemble , the positivity of the fluctuations @xmath46 does not guarantee the positivity of @xmath47 .    for @xmath48",
    ", it is seen that the relations ( [ dphib ] ) and ( [ d2phib ] ) go to the corresponding relations for the case of canonical ensemble . also in this limit , from eqs .",
    "( [ dphigam ] ) and ( [ d2phib ] ) we get an interesting relation given by : @xmath49 which resembles in form with a diffusion equation .    the entropy @xmath50 as given by ( [ defsg ] ) is the inverse legendre transform of @xmath51 , and can be expressed as : @xmath52 whereby @xmath50 is a function of the specified values of the constraints i.e. @xmath18 and @xmath46 .",
    "therefore we have the following thermodynamic relations @xmath53",
    "we remark that although the thermodynamics of a system in the ege is well defined by the equations in the previous section , it is not straighforward to establish a mutual equilibrium condition for two different systems that would allow to establish a zeroth law ( or , equivalently , an intensive temperature)@xcite .",
    "this problem is due to the non additive character of the potential @xmath51 .",
    "let us consider two systems @xmath54 and @xmath55 with hamiltonians @xmath56 and @xmath57 . by applying the rules derived in the previous sections independently to the two systems",
    ", one can derive the thermodynamic potentials @xmath58 , @xmath59 as well as the mean energies @xmath60 and @xmath61",

    "note that @xmath65 as well as the average indicated by the angular brackets are computed with the probability distribution corresponding to the composite system @xmath12 which , in general , can not be written as a product of probability distributions for systems @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the average values are , in general , non - additive ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "but even if additivity of @xmath18 is imposed , the potential @xmath67 remains non - additive .",
    "the correction term depends on the microscopic details of the two hamiltonians @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this lack of additivity does not allow to define an equivalence relation of `` mutual '' equilibrium .",
    "consider that two systems are known to be independently in equilibrium with a bath characterized by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "on putting the two systems in contact with bath simultaneously , their properties ( probability distribution ) will change .",
    "the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 are , consequently , properties of the bath and can not be considered as properties of the system , contrary to what occurs with the corresponding @xmath0 in the standard canonical ensemble .",
    "in standard thermodynamics , the stability criterion @xmath68 is derived from the condition of maximum entropy .",
    "the derivation @xcite considers a partition of an isolated system into any two subsystems . by allowing the two subsystems to alter their energies at fixed total energy",
    ", one can analyze the entropy change when the system is ( virtually ) displaced out of equilibrium .",
    "the condition of the maximum total entropy allows to deduce that the equilibrium state corresponds to a state with homogeneous @xmath0 ( equilibrium condition ) and with @xmath69 ( stability condition ) . for the derivation ,",
    "nevertheless , additivity of the entropy of the two subsystems must be used .    within our new formalism , an additivity assumption can not be used .",
    "therefore it is not straightforward to establish a stability criterion . although we can not give a rigorous proof , in this section we provide some evidences that the same criterion ( @xmath70 ) must hold .",
    "first of all , it interesting to remark that the requirement of eq .",
    "( [ defu ] ) that allows to find @xmath18 can be rewritten as an extremal condition .",
    "consider the definition of an `` out - of - equilibrium '' potential : @xmath71 note that here we are considering @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath18 as independent variables .",
    "@xmath18 shall not be regarded as the internal energy but as a parameter that allows virtual displacements out of equilibrium .",
    "it can be checked that the self consistent eq .",
    "( [ defu ] ) can then be written as : @xmath72 therefore , only the extrema of @xmath73 correspond to equilibrium solutions : @xmath74 . by substituting in @xmath73 one",

    "( [ defzg ] ) note that if @xmath76 and @xmath77 , then @xmath78 and therefore @xmath79 .",
    "we can use this `` out - of - equilibrium '' potential to define a stability criterion .",
    "it is straighforward to compute its second derivative : @xmath80 note that the positivity of @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ defc ] ) would guarantee that this second derivative of @xmath73 is negative and therefore the state of equilibrium corresponds to maxima of @xmath81 with respect to @xmath18 displacements .",
    "although , contrary to what happens in the standard canonical ensemble , the positivity of @xmath46 does not ensure the sign of @xmath82 in general , at least we can derive that for small and positive values of @xmath1 : @xmath83 thus we suggest that this is the stability criterion to be used within the ege , and we will use it in section [ appli ] for the analysis of some examples .",

    "the system is not able to disorder completely anymore and always keeps a certain magnetization ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "this can be regarded as a `` phase transition '' , that occurs at @xmath125 .",
