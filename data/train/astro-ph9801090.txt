    "processes involving neutrinos are important in a variety of astrophysical contexts , usually involving highly degenerate , relativistic plasmas .",
    "for example , neutrinos provide a cooling mechanism for red giants in the later stages of their evolution through the generation of neutrino  antineutrino pairs from photons ( adams , ruderman and woo 1963 ; braaten and segel 1993 ) . of particular interest here",
    "is the intense flux of neutrinos generated in the first few seconds of a type ii supernova ( sn ) explosion ( bethe 1990 ) .",
    "there is a difficulty in understanding how the explosion occurs .",
    "the sn shock , which is needed to eject the stellar envelope , stalls due to energy losses through dissociation of nuclei .",
    "heating by neutrinos is thought to be required to drive this shock .",
    "wilson ( 1985 ) considered heating through direct neutrino scattering : highly beamed neutrinos are scattered by particles in the post shock plasma and deposit energy and momentum into this material , thereby driving the shock expansion .",
    "an alternative mechanism for the deposition of the neutrino energy behind the sn shock is the neutrino beam instability ( bingham et al .",
    "1994 ) , where the neutrinos emitted from the sn core drive a plasma instability which produces langmuir turbulence .",
    "these langmuir waves are then collisionally damped , thereby heating the plasma , and driving the sn shock .",
    "this instability may be understood by analogy with a more familiar electron beam instability : neutrinos propagating through a plasma emit longitudinal waves ( langmuir waves in an unmagnetized plasma ) just as electrons do .",
    "this implies that for any plasma instability which relies on cerenkov emission of langmuir waves by electrons as the driving microscopic process , there is an analogous neutrino driven plasma instability .",
    "the simplest plasma instability is the beam instability , where a beam of electrons ( e.g. , briggs , 1964 ) , photons ( gedalin and eichler 1993 ; melrose 1994 ) , or neutrinos ( bingham et al . 1994 ) , causes langmuir waves to grow through induced cerenkov emission .    in this paper a systematic development of the neutrino beam instability of langmuir waves",
    "is developed based on the analogy with the electron beam and photon beam cases .",
    "a kinetic version of the neutrino beam instability is described , and the growth rate for this instability is calculated .",
    "the results are applied to the sn shock problem , and it is argued , contrary to the conclusions of bingham et al . ( 1994 ) . that the instability is ineffective and unimportant .",
    "it is known that a neutrino propagating through a medium acquires an induced charge ( oraevsky and semikoz 1987 ; nieves and pal 1994 ) through resonant interactions with the electrons in the medium .",
    "it is through this induced charge that neutrinos couple to plasma waves .",
    "emission by a neutrino has been considered both for longitudinal waves ( tsytovich 1964 ; oraevsky and semikoz 1987 ) and for transverse waves ( dolivo , nieves and pal 1990 ; giunti , kim and lam 1991 ) .",
    "( we note that the emission of a transverse wave by a neutrino is kinematically allowed only if the refractive index of the waves is greater than unity ) . the interaction between a neutrino and a langmuir wave",
    "is treated here using the standard electroweak model in the one - loop approximation .",
    "the derivation of the probability for cerenkov emission by a neutrino of a langmuir wave to lowest order in an expansion in @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mass of the @xmath2 boson , is summarized in appendix a. we do not consider the effects of extensions to the standard model , such as allowing neutrinos to have inherent electric and magnetic moments or a nonzero intrinsic mass .",
    "bingham et al . ( 1994 ; hereinafter bdsb ) calculated the growth rate of a reactive version of the neutrino beam instability and predicted that the neutrino flux from the sn core would be sufficient to drive the instability .",
    "the theory used by bdsb was overly restrictive , in that it was assumed that the neutrino beam was monoenergetic and that it propagated in a cold plasma , two assumptions which increase the calculated growth rate .",
    "we also show that the  effective potential \" neutrino - plasmon coupling used by bdsb does not incorporate all of the necessary electroweak physics , which may also have a dramatic effect on the growth rate of the reactive instability .",
    "we develop a kinetic version of the reactive instability proposed by bdsb , using methods explicitly based on the electroweak theory and drawing on techniques used in analysis of electron and photon beam instabilities .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the emission of longitudinal plasmons by neutrinos and relate this process to the theory of plasma instabilities . in section 3 the emission and absorption coefficients are evaluated for some specific neutrino distributions .",
    "it is shown that for a beamed distribution the absorption coefficient is negative over a range of values , implying that wave growth occurs for a sufficiently intense neutrino beam . in section 4 ,",
    "the absorption coefficient is evaluated for parameters relevant to type ii sne and it is shown that the kinetic instability is far too weak to operate . a comparison with the work of bdsb is then made , identifying important concerns for an explicit electroweak calculation of the reactive version of the neutrino beam instability .",
    "we also suggest that collisional damping completely swamps any tendency to wave growth .",
    "natural units ( @xmath3 ) are used throughout , except where otherwise specified .",
    "the treatment here of a neutrino beam instability is closely analogous with the earlier treatments of an electron beam instability ( e.g. , melrose 1986 , p.  53 ) and a photon beam instability ( melrose 1994 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the occupation number of the langmuir waves is described by a kinetic equation . in general ,",
    "the kinetic equation is written in a semi - classical form involving the probability per unit time , @xmath4 , that a particle ( electron , photon or neutrino ) emit a wave quantum in an arbitrary wave mode @xmath5 . for present purposes , we restrict attention to the emission of the simplest longitudinal electromagnetic quantum in a plasma , a langmuir wave . after a description of the mechanism through which a neutrino in a plasma may emit a langmuir wave , the probability of this process , which is derived in appendix a , is written down for massless neutrinos and is simplified .",
    "cerenkov emission by a neutrino in a plasma occurs through resonant interactions of the type shown diagramatically in figure 1 .",
    "an electron in the plasma scatters off a neutrino via either @xmath2-boson or @xmath6-boson exchange and in doing so emits a wave quantum .",
    "this process is resonant when the incoming electron momentum is equal to its outgoing momentum .",
    "the probability of the emission of a wave quantum by a neutrino in a plasma is then calculated by averaging the probability of this resonant process over all the electrons in the plasma .",
    "alternately , one may consider the processes shown in figure 2 , and interpret the internal electron lines as electron propagators averaged over the electrons and positrons in the plasma ( this is the approach adopted in appendix a ) .",
    "there are then two contributions from each of the diagrams of figure 2 .",
    "the first contribution is due to the vacuum contribution of virtual electron - positron pairs .",
    "this term may does not contribute here because the emission of a photon by a massless neutrino in vacuo is kinematically forbidden .",
    "the second contribution is due to the real electrons and positrons in the plasma , and is equivalent to the average over the resonant interactions shown in figure 1 .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath7 the two diagrams of figure 2 may be combined to form the 4-point interaction shown in figure 3 .",
    "nieves and pal ( 1994 ) have calculated the induced charge on a neutrino in a medium .",
    "the matrix element for the interaction shown in figure 3 ( cf .",
    "appendix a ) may be written in the form of an electromagnetic interaction @xmath8 , from which the 4-current , @xmath9 , for the neutrino is identified .",
    "the actual value of the effective charge on the neutrino , which follows from @xmath10 , is a fraction of order @xmath11 of the charge of the electron , where @xmath12 is the fermi constant , @xmath13 is the electron number density , and @xmath14 is the electron temperature as an energy . for plasma parameters relevant to the post shock region of a type ii sn ,",
    "this fraction is of order @xmath15 .",
    "the only relevant kinematic restriction to the emission process shown in figure 2 is conservation of 4-momentum .",
    "denoting the 4-momenta of the neutrinos and the photons by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , conservation of momentum is satisfied ( for @xmath18 ) provided that the phase speed of the wave is less than the group velocity of the neutrino .",
    "the phase speed of the langmuir wave is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is its frequency , given by the solution of the dispersion relation of the plasma .",
    "a general form of the dispersion relation for langmuir waves in a fermi - dirac plasma is written down in appendix b below .",
    "for massless neutrinos the neutrino group velocity ( to lowest order in @xmath7 ) is the speed of light . induced effects lead to a energy - momentum relation for massless neutrinos given by ( nieves 1989 ) @xmath21 , where @xmath13 is the number density of electrons .",
    "although this implies an effective mass and a phase speed less than that of light , the resulting corrections are negligible in the applications considered here .",
    "for example , for electron densities relevant to the post shock region of a type - ii sn , @xmath22 , the induced mass is less than @xmath23 for a neutrino with energy @xmath24 .",
    "thus , we may assume the simple vacuum energy - momentum relation for the neutrinos and the kinematic restriction on the emission of langmuir waves is @xmath25 where @xmath26 for massless neutrinos .",
    "we turn now to the calculation of the probability of emission of a langmuir wave by massless neutrinos in a plasma .",
    "this expression is then simplified to lowest order in @xmath27 in order to calculate the growth rates for the neutrino beam instability .",
    "the calculation of the probability per unit time of emission of a langmuir wave by a massless neutrino is outlined in appendix a ( cf .",
    "hardy and melrose , 1996 ) .",
    "the probability may be written , viz .",
    "equation ( [ eq : fprob ] ) , @xmath28\\left(1- { \\omega^2 \\over { |{\\bf k}|^2 } } \\right)^2 , \\label{eq : prob}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the fermi constant , @xmath29 is the fine structure constant , @xmath30 is a plasmon normalization factor ( defined in appendix b ) , with @xmath31 and where @xmath32 is understood .",
    "a convenient simplifying assumption in the calculation of the emission and absorption coefficients is to neglect the photon recoil .",
    "the recoil is the change in momentum , @xmath33 , of the neutrino due to emission of a wave quantum , with momentum @xmath34 , and the recoil is small for @xmath35 , which also corresponds to @xmath36 .",
    "expanding the argument of the @xmath37function of equation ( [ eq : prob ] ) in @xmath38 and retaining only the lowest order term gives @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "ignoring the small induced mass of the neutrino implies @xmath41 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : prv ] ) may also be written @xmath42 with @xmath43 with @xmath44 and where @xmath45 is the angle between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "note that , with the neglect of the photon recoil , the probability per unit time of emission is independent of the initial energy of the neutrino .      in the semi - classical formalism used here , the distribution of plasmons is described by their occupation number , @xmath48 , and the neutrinos are assumed non - degenerate , with distribution function normalized according to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number density of neutrinos .",
    "the time evolution of the plasmon distribution is governed by a kinetic equation , which includes those processes which change the number of plasmons present at a given energy through spontaneous and stimulated emission and by absorption .",
    "thus , the kinetic equation may be written @xmath51 .",
    "\\label{eq : ke}\\ ] ] where the first term within the brackets represents spontaneous and stimulated emission , and the second term represents the inverse process , absorption of a plasmon ( microscopic reversibility requires that the probability of emission and absorption be equal ) .    for sufficiently smooth distribution functions",
    ", @xmath52 may be taylor expanded , and then equation ( [ eq : ke ] ) gives @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the emission and absorption coefficients , respectively .",
    "these coefficients appear in explicit solutions to equation ( [ eq : kin ] ) . in the long time limit",
    ", the occupation number of the plasmons goes as @xmath56 for stable distributions , such as a thermal isotropic distribution , @xmath57 is positive , and the plasmon distribution tends to a constant level . if @xmath57 is negative , wave growth may occur . however , @xmath58 is not a sufficient condition for wave growth , as there are other competing plasma processes which remove langmuir waves from the plasma .",
    "two of these are landau damping by thermal electrons and collisional damping , with damping coefficients denoted by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "for growth to occur , @xmath61 must satisfy @xmath62 this condition sets the threshold on the neutrino intensity required for the instability to produce langmuir turbulence . a particularly severe restriction is imposed by collisional damping which is of order @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the number of thermal electrons per debye sphere . for the dense plasma around",
    "the sn core @xmath64 is not a particularly large number ( @xmath65 ) , so that collisional damping is a strong effect to be overcome in order for the langmuir waves to grow .",
    "we turn now to evaluating the emission and absorption coefficients for a distribution of massless neutrinos .",
    "we assume that the neutrino distribution is axisymmetric and separable in spherical polar coordinates , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the streaming direction : @xmath68 the plasmon momentum is written in terms of spherical coordinates @xmath69 .    to perform the integrals in equation ( [ eq : emission ] )",
    "explicitly we need the following identity ( melrose & stenhouse 1977 ) , @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 . using equation ( [ eq : ide ] ) , we find @xmath73 with @xmath74      to evaluate the absorption coefficient , equation ( [ eq : absorption ] ) , we first write @xmath75 { \\partial",
    "\\over \\partial \\phi}. \\label{eq : ddp}\\ ] ] our system is axisymmetric , so @xmath76 .",
    "thus equation ( [ eq : absorption ] ) gives @xmath77 the quantities @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the coefficients of the relevant derivatives in equation ( [ eq : ddp ] ) .",
    "further evaluation of the absorption coefficient involves either performing the integrals directly or expanding the particle distribution in legendre polynomials ( melrose & stenhouse 1977 ) .",
    "one finds @xmath80 neutrinos of all energies interact with the waves satisfying @xmath81 .",
    "for very low energy neutrinos , the condition @xmath82 is not satisfied .",
    "the contribution from these low - energy neutrinos is unimportant in the present discussion , and the integral is extended to @xmath83 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : ec ] ) and ( [ eq : dc ] ) may be evaluated for any separable axisymmetric particle distribution .",
    "our main application of this work is to the neutrinos emitted from the core of type ii sne , where the neutrinos passing through a point in the post shock region are beamed due to their distance from the sn core .",
    "however , we first show that no isotropic distribution of massless neutrinos can cause kinetic wave growth .      an isotropic distribution of neutrinos with arbitrary distribution function , @xmath84 has @xmath85 . substituting this into equation ( [ eq : g ] ) we find that @xmath86 and hence @xmath87 and @xmath88 it follows that the absorption coefficient is non negative and hence wave growth is impossible for an isotropic distribution of massless neutrinos .",
    "this result also holds for electron and photon beam instabilities .",
    "the analysis relevant to type ii sne is continued through the introduction of a particular form of beamed neutrino distribution which allows the analytic evaluation of equations ( [ eq : ec ] ) and ( [ eq : dc ] ) .",
    "the absorption coefficient is then maximized ( in the negative sense ) with respect to the angle of emission to determine for which direction maximum growth may occur .",
    "we consider a highly beamed distribution of the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the beam opening angle ( which is the angle subtended by the neutrinosphere on the sky for type ii sne ) .",
    "we need to evaluate @xmath91 for this distribution .",
    "clearly , @xmath91 is non - zero only for @xmath92 , so we expand @xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "this leads to @xmath96^{1/2 } \\sin\\chi_0.\\ ] ] thus , @xmath97 , \\label{eq : gb}\\ ] ] and we also have @xmath98,\\ ] ] where we neglect the derivative of the slowly varying @xmath99 factor .",
    "hence , the emission coefficient is given by equation ( [ eq : ec ] ) with equation ( [ eq : gb ] ) and the absorption coefficient is given by @xmath100 the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : gr ] ) is negative and largest in magnitude for @xmath101 .",
    "thus the maximum growth for langmuir waves occurs at an angle @xmath102 to the beam axis .",
    "the maximum growth rate corresponds to @xmath103 equation ( [ eq : gmax ] ) and ( [ eq : gb ] ) imply @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the neutrino intensity .",
    "neutrinos produced in the core of a type ii sn are scattered many times as they diffuse outwards to a region which allows essentially free propagation ( for a review of the physics of type ii sn see bethe 1990 ) .",
    "thus , the neutrinos have an approximately thermal energy spectrum and appear to be emitted from a surface enclosing the core known as the neutrinosphere .",
    "hence , we may write the neutrino distribution function as @xmath106 with @xmath107 which is defined by equation ( [ eq : nnu ] ) , and where @xmath108 and @xmath105 are the temperature ( in units of energy ) and intensity of the neutrinos , respectively .",
    "the use of a thermal distribution of neutrinos implies that some neutrinos in the low energy tail do not satisfy the kinematic condition ( [ eq : kcon ] ) , implying that the neglect of the photon recoil is not longer justified for these neutrinos .",
    "however , as already remarked , the fraction of neutrinos not satisfying this condition is negligible , provided the condition @xmath109 is satisfied , as is the case in practice .    at a distance @xmath110 from the core , where @xmath111 is the radius of the neutrinosphere",
    ", the neutrinos are confined to @xmath112 .",
    "hence , we take @xmath113 in equation ( [ eq : beam ] )",
    ". evaluation of the integral in equation ( [ eq : gmax ] ) gives , in ordinary units , @xmath114    the langmuir wave dispersion relation in the post shock region of a type ii sn requires careful consideration .",
    "the relevant plasma is in an awkward parameter regime .",
    "although degeneracy may be neglected , the plasma is neither ultrarelativistic nor nonrelativistic .",
    "furthermore , the kinematic condition on wave emission , @xmath115 , excludes the use of simple , known interpolation formulae which are valid only for @xmath116 ( braaten and segel , 1993 ) . the approach adopted here is to calculate the dispersion relation , @xmath20 , and the normalization factor , @xmath117 , directly from the general expressions for an electron - positron plasma given by hayes and melrose ( 1984 ) .",
    "this theory is summarised in appendix b.    we adopt the parameters used by bdsb for the material in the post shock region of a type ii sn : @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",
    "we also assume a neutrino temperature of @xmath122 .",
    "the electron temperature is thought to be around @xmath123 ( miller , wilson , and mayle , 1993 ) .",
    "using the techniques outlined in appendix b , dispersion relations for a variety of plasma temperatures and a fixed electron density of @xmath118 are plotted in figure 4 .",
    "this is a plot of phase speed , @xmath124 , against normalized wave number , @xmath125 .",
    "the cutoff in the dispersion relation at high @xmath126 occurs when the intrinsic damping of the mode ( the landau damping ) becomes comparable to the frequency of the mode . in this event",
    "the plasma does not have a normal mode at that wave momentum , as any wave is highly damped within one wave cycle . in a nonrelativistic plasma , landau damping limits the range of phase velocities to @xmath127 . as @xmath14 increases , the range @xmath128 shrinks , where @xmath129 is the limit imposed by landau damping . in the ultrarelativistic limit",
    "the allowed range of @xmath115 becomes very narrow .",
    "this has immediate consequence for the strength of the emission process of langmuir waves by neutrinos .",
    "equation ( [ eq : prob ] ) shows that the emission probability is proportional to @xmath130 which is small for @xmath131 .",
    "this greatly suppresses the absorption coefficient in these high temperature plasmas . in the ultrarelativistic limit",
    ", the region for which @xmath132 is vanishingly small , and all emission is forbidden .    the maximum negative absorption coefficient , equation ( [ eq : maxg ] ) , for @xmath133 is plotted in figure 5 as a function of normalized wave number .",
    "it is clear that this growth rate is far too small to produce any langmuir turbulence over the time scale of the 3 second neutrino burst .",
    "indeed , this instability is too weak to overcome even the landau damping of the sn plasma .",
    "the growth rate calculated here is approximately 11 orders of magnitude smaller than that calculated by bdsb , who obtained a growth rate for a reactive instability of @xmath134 .",
    "part of the difference between these results lies in the the fact that a kinetic instability has been considered here ( with a thermal distribution of neutrinos ) , rather than the reactive instability considered bdsb ( who assume a monoenergetic distribution of neutrinos ) .",
    "the greatest part of the discrepancy lies in the supression due to the high phase speed of the longitudinal waves of the sn plasma , which is a factor of approximately @xmath135 .",
    "this does not appear in the work of bdsb due to their artificial assumption concerning the properties of neutrinos , as is discussed below .",
    "one further point regarding the collisional damping of the plasma is required .",
    "this damping was not considered by bdsb . for the parameters of the post schock plasma assumed by bdsb",
    "the collisional damping is @xmath136 , which is many orders of magnitude greater than the growth rates calculated either here or in bdsb .",
    "it is not clear to the present authors how any wave mode may be generated in a plasma with such overwhelming collisional damping .",
    "we conclude that the neutrino beam instability is ineffective in the post shock region of a type ii sn .",
    "the kinetic plasma instability discussed above is different from the reactive instability discussed by bdsb . as with most instabilities ,",
    "these could be regarded as kinetic and reactive limits of a more general instability ( e.g. briggs 1964 ; melrose 1986 ) .",
    "the kinetic version applies when the growth rate is less than the bandwidth of the growing waves , when the random - phase approximation applies , and the reactive version applies in the opposite limit when a fixed - phase disturbance grows in association with localized bunching of the particles ( neutrinos ) .",
    "however , this equivalence does not apply to the kinetic instability discussed here and the reactive instability discussed by bdsb because of important differences in the underlying treatment of the neutrinos .",
    "the theory of bdsb describes the neutrino - langmuir wave coupling through an effective potential in a klein - gordon equation for the neutrino wave field ( bethe 1986 ) .",
    "thus the assumed neutrino dynamics are those of a spin-0 particle , rather than the left handed spin-@xmath137 particle of the standard model .",
    "the consequence of this assumption is that emission of a langmuir wave in the forward direction is allowed in the theory of bdsb , whilst it is forbidden in the electroweak theory due to parity considerations .",
    "this is demonstrated in equation ( [ eq : prv ] ) above , and in dolivo , nieves and pal ( 1996 ) .",
    "we commence our comparison of the theories from equation ( 20 ) of bdsb , which may be written in our notation as @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the plasma frequency , @xmath140 includes the real wave frequency and the wave damping , and @xmath141 denotes an infinitessimal imaginary part ( the landau prescription ) .",
    "this equation describes the contribution of neutrinos to the dispersive properties of langmuir waves in the theory of bdsb .",
    "note that in the limit of no neutrino flux , equation ( [ eq : bdsb1 ] ) gives @xmath142 , which is the cold plasma dispersion relation , and @xmath143 , which is the landau damping of the finite temperature plasma .",
    "the growth rate of the reactive instability of bdsb is calculated by considering the real part of the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : bdsb1 ] ) .",
    "the growth rate for the kinetic instability , in the cold plasma limit , is calculated from the imaginary part of the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : bdsb1 ] ) , due to the pole in the integrand .",
    "this imaginary part may be isoloated through the plemelj formula @xmath144 this imaginary part picks out the resonant interactions given by the condition @xmath145 .    to illustrate the effect of the different assumptions made concerning the neutrino properties",
    ", we calculate the kinetic counterpart of the reactive instability considered by bdsb .",
    "the reactive version is obtained from equation ( [ eq : bdsb1 ] ) by omitting the factor @xmath141 and partially integrating before setting @xmath146 , and solving the resulting algebraic equation for solutions with complex frequency .",
    "the analogous kinetic version is obtained by retaining only the resonant part when equation ( 36 ) is inserted in equation ( 35 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath147 where @xmath148 the result ( [ eq : c1 ] ) is to be compared with equation ( [ eq : absorption ] ) in the cold plasma limit , where @xmath149 , and @xmath142 , which gives @xmath150 for @xmath151 , as assumed by bdsb , equations ( [ eq : c1 ] ) and ( [ eq : c2 ] ) differ only in the factor @xmath130 in equation ( [ eq : c2 ] ) .",
    "this is precisely the term which appears through the absence of a right handed component ot the neutrino plane wave state , as discussed above . in particular , in a mildly relativistic plasma where the only relevant langmuir waves have @xmath115 and @xmath152 , the factor @xmath130 in equation ( 38 ) implies that the growth rate for left - handed neutrinos is very much smaller than for the boson - like neutrinos assumed by bdsb .",
    "it is clear from the difference between equations ( [ eq : c1 ] ) and ( [ eq : c2 ] ) for @xmath153 that any analysis of neutrino - plasma interactions must be based on an explicit electroweak description of the microscopic processes occuring in the plasma .",
    "this has the added advantage of allowing the analysis to be performed at relativistic temperatures , high densities , and for broadband neutrino distributions , which are the major approximations in the work of bdsb .",
    "an electroweak theory description of the reactive neutrino beam instability is in progress .",
    "in principle , a sufficiently intense , highly beamed distribution of neutrinos generates langmuir turbulence in a manner analogous to an electron or photon beam . the kinetic version of this instability , which is studied here , is found to be too weak an instability to be relevant in any known terrestial or space plasma .",
    "the reactive counterpart of this instability was suggested by bdsb in connection with the reheating of the plasma behind the stalled shock of a type ii sn .",
    "however , for simplicity , bdsb used a boson - like model for the neutrino rather than the electroweak theory which allows only left - handed neutrinos . from a comparison of the results of our work , based on the electroweak theory , with that of bdsb ,",
    "it is clear that the two theories lead to quatitatively different results for langmuir waves with phase speeds close to the speed of light , cf .",
    "equations ( [ eq : c1 ] ) and ( [ eq : c2 ] ) . as the case @xmath115 and @xmath152 is relevant to the sn problem , an electroweak theory of the reactive instability needs to be constructed , allowing for finite neutrino bandwidth , a finite temperature plasma , and correct inclusion of the neutrino spin effects . such a theory is presently being developed .",
    "however , given the strong collisional damping of the sn plasma it is unlikely that even the reactive instability can be sufficiently strong to operate in the way suggested by bdsb .",
    "it may be that other plasma instabilities driven by an intense neutrino beam operate in such plasmas .",
    "a thorough investigation of the consequences of the large induced current generated by a strong flux of neutrinos in a dense plasma is required .",
    "such an investigation should investigate the effect of an intrinsic neutrino mass , and other extensions to the standard model of particle physics , to determine whether there are any conditions under which neutrino plasma instabilities can be of astrophysical significance .",
