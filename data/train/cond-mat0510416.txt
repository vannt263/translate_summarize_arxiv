    "a popular scenario to explain the complex physics of the high - temperature superconductors is based on the idea that the ground state of these materials exhibits some form of charge ordering tendency ( charge stripes , checkerboard order , etc . )",
    "@xcite , which , in turn , can lead to incommensurate magnetism ( spin stripes ) . from the outset we state that we do not subscribe to this point of view . in order to illustrate the direction of our efforts",
    ", we will take as an example the la cuprate family , of which the most studied representative is la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( lsco ) ( @xmath4 is the hole doping ) .",
    "this compound is commonly believed to show `` dynamic '' charge order near the special doping value @xmath5 , while static order ( although quite weak ) has been observed with additional nd co - doping , or upon the substitution la@xmath6ba . however",
    "the rest of the lsco phase diagram at low doping @xmath7 does not exhibit any charge order @xcite making it rather hard to accept the universal concept that holes in antiferromagnets fundamentally tend to segregate into charge stripes or similar structures .",
    "we start from the guiding principle that spin order is the primary phenomenon while charge order is an exception to the rule and could possibly occur under special circumstances only ( such as dopings corresponding to commensurate spin structures ) .",
    "this leads to a natural candidate for the ground state - the spiral spin state , as pointed out quite a while ago @xcite .",
    "we will seek to provide theoretical support for the validity of the spiral picture within the extended @xmath3 model , as well as explain two sets of phenomena observed in lsco :    * the presence of incommensurate magnetic order ( with incommensurability = doping ) both in the metallic ( superconducting ) and insulating phases at low doping , and in particular the mysterious change of the incommensurability direction by 45@xmath8 at the metal - insulator transition point @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "* the in - plane transport anisotropy , as high as 50% , observed in the insulating spin glass phase ( @xmath10 ) @xcite .    the near equality of incommensurability and doping is usually considered as one of the successes of the charge stripe scenario , whereas the 45@xmath8 rotation could follow from considerations based on hole - pair checkerboard order @xcite .",
    "the transport anisotropy of course also could be interpreted as a signature of ( fluctuating ) charge order , although no specific calculations have been performed @xcite .    in the spirit of our alternative philosophy",
    "we will show that a theory based on holes moving in an antiferromagnet and causing the formation of a spiral spin density wave can explain the above phenomena , giving in particular a _ quantitative _ value for the magnitude of the transport anisotropy .",
    "the spiral theory is fermi liquid in nature @xcite , without any charge ordering tendencies , and stands on firm theoretical ground .",
    "it also provides a unified and consistent picture of the relationship between incommensurate magnetism and transport anisotropy .",
    "the spiral order is generated by the hole motion in the nel antiferromagnetic state , in an attempt of the magnetic background to partially relieve the frustration caused by the hopping @xcite .",
    "this leads to the non - collinear configurations shown in fig .  1 .",
    "parametrizing the magnetic order as : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , the angle of deviation from collinearity is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the spiral vector directed along the @xmath15 or @xmath16 lattice directions .",
    "these are both co - planar configurations , and the unit vector @xmath17 is perpendicular to the spin plane . for low doping corresponding to small deviations from nel order , one finds that @xmath14 is proportional to doping : @xmath18 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath19 is the hopping , @xmath20 is the spin stiffness , and @xmath21 is the quasiparticle residue at the points @xmath22 , corresponding to the minima of the hole dispersion at low doping .",
    "it was realized shortly after the first several works on the spiral physics that the spiral state have a tendency towards some kind of instability in the charge sector ( phase separation ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , within the @xmath3 model one finds a negative charge compressibility , @xmath23 , defined , as in fermi liquid theory , through a derivative of the ground state energy @xmath24 .",
    "the presence of such an instability towards a hole segregated state would then mean that charge stripes in some form are likely to be present in the ground state .",
    "under what conditions would the fermi liquid physics survive ?",
    "a possibility that we have recently explored in detail is the presence of additional ( next nearest neighbor ) hoppings @xmath25 @xcite . for lsco",
    "the values of these parameters are quite small : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the magnetic exchange , and @xmath28 . from now on .",
    "] however we find that their presence is crucial for the stability of the system . in order to perform as accurate calculations as possible",
    "we follow a two - step procedure : ( 1 . ) the one hole properties , such as @xmath21 and the low - energy dispersion @xmath29 near the nodal points are calculated in the self - consistent born approximation , and ( 2 . )",
    "these are inserted into the many - body fermion - magnon low - energy vertices which are then treated in perturbation theory ( loop expansion ) in powers of @xmath30 .",
    "we call this technique `` chiral perturbation theory '' , by analogy with qcd .",
    "the perturbative parameter is not small , since @xmath31 , and thus @xmath32 .",
    "however we find that the perturbation theory converges numerically extremely well @xcite , as if governed by the effective coupling constant @xmath33 .",
    "are in units of @xmath27 .",
    "inset : stability boundary at different levels of approximation ( loops ) , showing the good convergence . ]    the results , presented in fig .  2 ,",
    "indicate that fairly small values of @xmath25 stabilize the uniform @xmath16 spiral state .",
    "the inset shows the transition line calculated in different loops ( powers of @xmath34 ) , confirming the good convergence and reliability of the results .",
    "our results are in a way not surprising because dmrg work @xcite had found that charge stripes which are stable at @xmath35 become unstable ( and thus the system becomes uniform ) upon introduction of @xmath36 . in our theory",
    "the stability depends physically on the shape of the fermi surface  while at @xmath35 it is very elongated in the antinodal direction ( @xmath37 ) , upon introduction of @xmath38 it becomes more spherically symmetric ( for example @xmath39 for the lsco values ) , and this effective two - dimensionality leads to the stability of the uniform spiral state .",
    "it should be noted that our calculations are valid for small doping @xmath40 , since we keep track of only the terms of order @xmath41 in the ground state energy , and thus the compressibility has the expansion @xmath42 , leading to a stability line which does not depend on doping .    the ground state energy change ( relative to the undoped nel state ) due to the spiral formation with the two symmetries , satisfies the relation : @xmath43 .",
    "this formula is correct to all perturbative orders that we have checked and can be traced to the different number of occupied hole pockets for the different spiral orientations @xcite . above the stability boundary",
    "where @xmath44 , the @xmath16 state has lower energy , but one can show that the overall energy change relative to the _ doped _ collinear ( nel ) state is negative @xcite . ] .",
    "the @xmath16 symmetry is the correct one for the metallic phase of lsco ( @xmath45 ) , where the elastic neutron scattering peaks are in a `` parallel '' pattern around @xmath46 @xcite . what happens if the system becomes an insulator ?",
    "as is clear from the calculation of the energy @xcite , the @xmath16 state has lower energy only due to the fermi motion energy @xmath47 . on the other hand",
    "if we let @xmath48 , which would be the case at the transition to the spin glass region @xmath49 where the holes are localized , then the @xmath15 state is selected ( consistent with neutron peaks in `` diagonal '' pattern @xcite ) .",
    "of course this argument can be applied only up to the metal - insulator transition point , beyond which a detailed model for the spiral formation has to be constructed @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it is clear that the spiral model can explain correctly the presence and the symmetries of the elastic neutron scattering peaks both in the metal and in the insulator .",
    "the exact location of those peaks ( determined by @xmath14 ) is also in very good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the insulating spin - glass region @xmath10 , where the presence of incommensurate magnetic peaks ( with @xmath15 symmetry ) is clearly related to the in - plane dc resistivity anisotropy @xmath50 @xcite ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the orthorhombic coordinates ) . from elastic neutron scattering @xcite the incommensurability is determined to be along the orthorhombic @xmath52 direction , meaning that in the spiral picture it is in the @xmath15 direction , as shown in fig .",
    "experimentally @xmath53 at the lowest temperature @xmath54 and then decreases , disappearing completely around @xmath55 where the system becomes quasi - metallic .    ) .",
    "inset : maximum ( @xmath56 ) anisotropy as a function of @xmath57 . ]",
    "since it is clear that the largest anisotropy is accumulated in the low - temperature region , we will concentrate on the strongly - localized , variable - range hopping ( vrh ) temperature range below approximately @xmath58 .",
    "the resistivity of lsco is well fit by the mott 2d vrh formula @xmath59 , with characteristic values @xmath60 , depending on doping . in order to address the anisotropy problem",
    "theoretically , one needs to develop a theory of spiral formation arising from the presence of ( randomly distributed ) localized holes .",
    "recent works have developed such theories @xcite , and in particular we have shown @xcite that holes , localized around @xmath61 ions can `` carry '' spiral correlations with them that decay in dipolar fashion at long distances . at finite doping the dipoles can order , producing a spiral state as the one in fig .",
    "1(a ) . within this framework",
    "we have calculated the vrh conductivity anisotropy by calculating first the wave - function of a localized hole ( with localization length @xmath62 ) , in the presence of spiral correlations @xcite : @xmath63 .",
    "this wave - function is anisotropic ( the angle @xmath64 is defined in fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , which is physically natural since the hole `` feels '' a different environment depending on the lattice direction , due to the non - collinearity of the spiral state .",
    "the strength of the anisotropy is controlled by the parameter @xmath57 , and @xmath65 for lsco ( where @xmath66 ) .",
    "the overlap of the wave - functions discussed above leads to the resistivity anisotropy , shown in fig .",
    "the magnitude of the anisotropy agrees extremely well with experiment @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that there are no adjustable parameters in our theory , although it is certainly valid at low doping only ( and , similarly to the stability results of section 2 , the curve in fig .",
    "3 is doping independent ) .",
    "perhaps most importantly , our analysis shows that the transport anisotropy can be due to the underlying incommensurate magnetic correlations , rather than a tendency of the charges to self - organize .",
    "the spiral spin density wave theory passes both the fundamental and phenomenological tests :",
    "it is well theoretically supported in the context if the extended @xmath3 model , and is capable of describing magnetic and transport properties of lsco .",
    "a novel finding is that the in - plane transport anisotropy fits well into the spiral picture on a quantitative level  we consider this result particularly important because the anisotropy is a rather elusive quantity and usually hard to calculate consistently .",
    "we should mention that the reported work essentially explored only the structure of the ground state ; how consistent the spiral picture would be with experiment at higher energy is not yet clear .",
    "nevertheless all low - temperature lsco experiments we have looked at so far lead us to the conclusion that the physics at low doping is _",
    "spin driven_. the recently observed `` magic '' doping concentrations , where the conductivity of lsco shows dips @xcite , are also due , in our view , to spin related phenomena ( such as special points where the spin structure becomes commensurate ) .",
    "currently research is in progress to explore further the predictions of the spin density wave approach ( e.g. in the direction of including lattice effects and studies of magnetotransport ) .",
    "the theory provides , we believe , a consistent picture of the complex interplay between spin and charge dynamics in the underdoped region of the cuprates ."
