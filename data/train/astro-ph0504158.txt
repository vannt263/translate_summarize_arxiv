    "observations link grbs  brief flashes of @xmath0-ray light emitted by sources at cosmological distances  with star - forming galaxies and high mass stars @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that grbs are produced by a rare type of supernova where the evolved core of a massive star collapses to a black hole .",
    "normal supernovae , where the stellar core collapses to form a neutron star , are thought to produce nonrelativistic supernova remnant shocks that accelerate cosmic rays with energies @xmath2 ev . the origin of higher energy cosmic rays is controversial .",
    "one possibility is that high - energy ( @xmath3 ev ) cosmic rays are accelerated by the relativistic shocks formed by grb explosions in the galaxy and throughout the universe @xcite , dating back to earlier suggestions of a galactic origin of high - energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "if grbs accelerate high - energy cosmic rays , then galactic grbs could be detected as cosmic - ray sources from neutron @xmath4-decay emissions @xcite .",
    "grbs with their jets oriented toward the earth have potentially lethal consequences , and may have contributed to past extinction episodes @xcite .",
    "the sources of the @xmath5 ev cosmic - ray excesses reported from measurements made with the sugar ( sydney university giant air shower recorder ) and agasa ( akeno giant air shower array ) detectors ( @xcite ; see @xcite for review ) have been proposed to result from past grbs in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "to investigate these ideas , the rate of grb events at different fluence levels is estimated , based on recent findings about beaming in grbs @xcite .",
    "a 3d propagation model is used to simulate the sequence of irradiation events that occurs when a grb jet is pointed towards earth .",
    "the results suggest that a grb jet could have produced radiations that contributed to the ordovician extinction event @xcite .",
    "our results are contrary to the claim that the sugar excess could be produced by a grb in the galaxy .",
    "if the auger observatory confirms the sugar cosmic - ray point source , then a model of high - energy cosmic rays from galactic grbs is incomplete .",
    "most of the electromagnetic radiation from a grb is emitted during the prompt and early afterglow phases on timescales of minutes to hours .",
    "we define the bolometric photon fluence @xmath6 with reference to the solar energy fluence @xmath7 ergs @xmath8 received at earth in one second .",
    "significant effects on atmospheric chemistry through formation of nitrous oxide compounds and depletion of the ozone layer is found when @xmath9  @xmath10 @xcite , taking into account the very hard incident radiation spectrum of grbs .",
    "reprocessing of incident grb radiation into biologically effective 200  320 nm uv radiation ( i.e. , with @xmath11 lethality ) on eukaryotes occurs when @xmath12  10@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "achromatic beaming breaks in grb optical / ir afterglow light curves @xcite , if due to jetted grbs , imply typical grb jet opening half - angles @xmath14 .",
    "analyses @xcite show that long - duration grbs have a standard total energy @xmath15 ergs , with @xmath16 , a variance by a factor of @xmath17 , and a low @xmath18 population . here",
    "@xmath18 is the apparent isotropic @xmath0-ray energy release inferred directly from observations .",
    "if the cone of emission from a grb at distance @xmath19 intercepts the line - of - sight to earth , then the radiant fluence is given by @xmath20 .",
    "thus the maximum sampling distance @xmath21 of a grb with apparent isotropic @xmath0-ray energy release @xmath18 to be detected at the fluence level @xmath22 is @xmath23    when @xmath24 , the sampling distance to a typical grb exceeds the @xmath25 pc disk scale height of molecular clouds and ob associations , and we can approximate the distribution of grbs in the galaxy by a uniform disk of radius @xmath26 kpc .",
    "the fluence size distribution of grbs in this approximation is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the rate of grbs in the milky way , and @xmath29 is the probability that the earth lies within the emission cone of a 2-sided jet .",
    "if grbs follow the star formation rate history of the universe , then one grb occurs every @xmath30 years in the milky way @xcite , with @xmath31  1 .",
    "thus @xmath32 estimates ( [ rsamp ] ) and ( [ nsc_1 ] ) show that a grb at a distance @xmath33 kpc with @xmath34 takes place about once every gyr , and more frequently if @xmath35 .",
    "we have developed a numerical model where cosmic rays move in response to a large - scale magnetic field that traces the spiral arm structure of the galaxy , and diffuse through pitch - angle scattering due to magnetic turbulence .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath36 of the galaxy is modeled as a bisymmertric spiral for the galaxy s disk , and a dipole magnetic field for the galaxy s halo @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the particle momentum @xmath37 is found by solving the lorentz force equation @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the particle s charge and mass , respectively , @xmath41 is its velocity , and @xmath42 .",
    "magnetic turbulence causes a particle to change its pitch angle by @xmath43 when travelling the mean - free - path @xmath44 .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath44 is obtained by extrapolating the expression for @xmath44 in a diffusion - model fit @xcite to the measured ionic flux near the knee of the cosmic - ray spectrum @xcite to high energies .",
    "our approach assumes isotropic turbulence that is uniform in the disk and halo of the galaxy ; anisotropic turbulence is more realistic @xcite , but increases the number of free parameters in the model .",
    "the particle s azimuth and cosine angle are randomly chosen between @xmath45 and @xmath46 and between @xmath47 and 1 , respectively , after every @xmath48 ^ 2/c\\delta t$ ] steps , where @xmath49 is the time interval of each step in the numerical integration , which is set equal to a small fraction of the local gyroperiod .",
    "the propagation calculations are performed in the test - particle approximation , assuming that the cosmic rays do not affect their surrounding environment .",
    "the energy density of the cosmic - ray shell can , however , greatly exceed the magnetic field energy density of the ism , in which case the protons will sweep up material , causing strong adiabatic losses and rapid deceleration withn a sedov length scale of @xmath50 pc .",
