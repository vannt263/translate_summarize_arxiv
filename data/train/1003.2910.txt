    "the evolutionary stage of a powerful radio source originated by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is related to its linear size . in this",
    "context , compact symmetric objects ( cso ) , which are powerful ( @xmath7 w / hz ) and intrinsically small ( i.e. linear size ls @xmath8 1 kpc ) radio sources , should represent a young stage in the individual radio source life .",
    "these objects usually have a roughly symmetric structure , with core , jets , and mini - lobes / hotspots , resembling a scaled - down version of the large classical radio galaxies which conversely have linear sizes of hundreds of kpc or even a few mpc .",
    "the main characteristic displayed by young radio sources is the convex synchrotron radio spectrum that peaks at frequencies in the ghz regime .",
    "the spectral turnover is usually due to synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although an additional contribution from free - free absorption ( ffa ) has been found in the most compact objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . + conclusive evidence of the genuine _ youth _ of this class of objects came from the determination of both kinematic and radiative ages",
    "+ the determination of the kinematic age is based on multi - epoch milliarcsecond - scale resolution observations spanning several years , and able to measure at which rate the hotspots are increasing their separation .",
    "assuming that the separation velocity @xmath9 has maintained constant , the kinematic age @xmath10 can be estimated : + @xmath11    from the analysis of a dozen of the most compact csos ( ls @xmath8 20 pc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has been derived that the separation speed is generally in the range of 0.1@xmath12 and 0.4@xmath12 , leading to kinematic ages of a few thousand years .",
    "+ the radiative age can be estimated by multi - frequency observations able to constrain the radio spectral shape and thus to determine at which frequency the spectral break occurs .",
    "the break frequency @xmath13 is strictly related to the radiative lifetime of the synchrotron emitting electrons @xmath14 .",
    "once the magnetic field is known , for example assuming minimum total energy content corresponding to equipartition between particles and magnetic field ( @xmath15 ) energies @xcite , and following some assumptions @xcite , the radiative age can be easily estimated by means of : + @xmath16    several studies aimed at estimating the radiative age in compact radio objects indicate ages between 10@xmath17 - 10@xmath18 years @xcite , in excellent agreement with the kinematic ages .",
    "+ given all the assumptions mentioned earlier , these methods do not provide the accurate source age , that can be improved either by increasing the time interval spanned by the observations or through a better sampling of the frequency coverage used to derive the radio spectrum .",
    "+ among all the csos studied in this framework , the radio source j0650 + 6001 represents a peculiar case .",
    "this source is identified with a quasar at redshift @xmath19 , and its optical spectrum is characterized by very weak broad lines and prominent narrow lines @xcite .",
    "it has a non - aligned triple radio structure with a total angular size of 7 mas ( @xmath2040 pc ) , and its total radio spectrum turns over around 5.5 ghz @xcite . from a previous study",
    "no evidence of proper motion has been found @xcite , although the resolution at 5 ghz ( i.e. the frequency at which several observations spanning almost a decade have been performed ) was not adequate to reliably estimate small changes in the component positions .",
    "however , another analysis of the position of the source components based on global vlbi observations @xcite , indicated an apparent contraction between the central and the southern components .",
    "+ in this paper we report on the results on multi - epoch vlbi and 5-ghz vla data of the compact symmetric object j0650 + 6001 , and we present an interpretation to explain the radio properties of this source . + throughout this paper , we assume the following cosmology : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , in a flat universe . at the redshift of the target 1@xmath24 kpc .",
    "the spectral index is defined as @xmath25 .",
    "+    .log of the archival vlba observations analyzed in this paper . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ components ]      decisive evidence supporting the idea that csos are radio sources in an early evolutionary stage has been provided by the measurements of the proper motion of the hotspots in compact csos ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to date , the cso j0650 + 6001 lacks a proper measurement of expansion velocity . on the other hand ,",
    "an apparent source contraction has been reported by @xcite , representing a very uncommon case among radio sources .",
    "+ to derive a possible source expansion , we decided to measure the distance between components s and n from the vlba+effelsberg image at 5 ghz .",
    "then we compared the result with what reported in @xcite and we found that the separation between these two components has increased by 0.28@xmath00.13 mas in 13.5 years ( i.e. the time interval between the two observations ) .",
    "we derive an apparent separation velocity of @xmath26 , that corresponds to a kinematic age of @xmath27 years .",
    "the accuracy of this separation velocity is limited since only two - epoch observations are available with adequate resolution and at the same frequency .",
    "we do not consider the vlba observations carried out in 1999 and 2006 @xcite , since the resolution was not adequate to reliably constrain the position of the northern component .",
    "+ to verify the apparent contraction reported by @xcite , we determined the separation between the central and the southern components from 1999 to 2006 , and we compared our results with those reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( see table [ components ] ) .",
    "then we modelled the data with a linear fit and we obtain that the separation between components c and s has decreased of about 0.29@xmath00.02 mas in 15.6 years ( i.e. the time interval spanned by the observations ) , corresponding to an apparent `` contraction '' velocity @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ mas ] ) .",
    "this suggests that component c likely enshrouds both the core region and the jet base which can not be resolved with the spatial resolution ( @xmath200.6 mas ) provided by the observations at the highest frequency .",
    "the observed contraction is indicative of a knot in the jet that is moving towards the southern lobe and it is oriented with a small angle with respect to the line of sight .",
    "for this reason the flux density of component c is likely dominated by this knot whose emission is enhanced by boosting effects .      the light curve at 5 ghz of j0650 + 6001 clearly indicates a steady increment of the total flux density measured by the vla over a period of nearly 18 years ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the presence of flux density variability in a cso is somewhat surprising , since young radio sources have been considered the least variable class of radio sources @xcite .",
    "however , evidence of an increment in the flux density in the optically - thick part of the spectrum may be easily explained in terms of source expansion , assuming that the spectral peak is due to ssa , as in the case of j0650 + 6001 @xcite , the source discussed here .",
    "as the source grows , the peak shifts towards lower frequencies , while the flux density in the optically - thick regime increases @xcite .",
    "[ lightcurve ] together with the total vla flux density , we report also the vlba flux density of components c and s. in the light curve of both the total source and component c , in addition to the steady increment of the flux density , it is also present a further contribution detectable in the 1998 ( vla ) and 1999 ( vlba ) data . on the other hand ,",
    "the light curve of component s is almost constant , with a possibly slight steady decrease , but without evidence of significant variability .",
    "this behaviour suggests that the total flux density is dominated by component c , that likely had an outburst close to the 1998 - 1999 observing epoch .",
    "the determination of the properties of the population of young radio sources is mainly based on the analysis of objects identified with galaxies , where boosting effects are thought to play a minor role .",
    "nonetheless , in some of the sources presented in @xcite also jets have been detected and the proper motion of knots have been measured ( for example in the sources j1945 + 7055 and j2355 + 4950 ) .",
    "the target source j0650 + 6001 is optically identified with a quasar , and its peculiar characteristics , such as the radio emission dominated by the core component , the high flux density asymmetry between the outer components and their misalignment , may be due to orientation effects that may modify the intrinsic source properties . to verify this hypothesis",
    ", we consider a beaming model which assumes that the source is intrinsically symmetric and the different flux density displayed by components n and s is due to doppler boosting . in this context , the flux density ratio is related to both the jet speed and its orientation @xmath29 with respect to the line of sight : + @xmath30    where we have assumed that component s is the one on the approaching side and @xmath31 , where @xmath12 is the speed of light . from vlbi data we found that r = 28 - 30 , depending on the frequency considered , and @xmath32 . with these values in eq .",
    "[ flusso ] , we find the possible combination of @xmath33 and @xmath29 that is reported in fig .",
    "[ teta ] between dotted lines .",
    "we must note that although eq .",
    "[ flusso ] usually applies to jet components , it can be used also to our purpose , since components n and s are hotspot dominated and an additional contribution from extended features like lobes is marginal since their high magnetic field @xcite causes strong radiative losses at least at the frequencies considered here .",
    "+ another way to derive the ( @xmath33-@xmath29 ) combination is from the measured separation velocity @xmath34 between components n and s , by means of : + @xmath35    considering @xmath36 as determined in section 3.3 , the resulting possible ( @xmath33-@xmath29 ) combinations are reported in fig .",
    "[ teta ] between solid lines . comparing the areas obtained with the two different methods , we obtain an intrinsic separation velocity @xmath37 and a source orientation with respect to the line of sight of 12@xmath5 and 28@xmath5 .",
    "+ the comparison of the flux density of the outer components may be not always appropriate .",
    "in fact , given the relativistic time dilation , we are watching the components at different stages of their evolution .",
    "this is particularly important in the case of blazars whose jets are oriented with very small angles @xmath38 to the line of sight , causing a quite rapid evolution due to boosting effects . on the other hand , this effect should not be relevant for j0650 + 6001 if we consider that the lobes / hotspots of this source are oriented at a relatively larger angle , as also supported by the lack of flux density variability in the southern component . + another way to determine the ( @xmath33-@xmath29 ) combination is based on the comparison of the distance of the two lobes with respect to the core .",
    "however , in this source the central component is likely dominated by a knot in the jet , thus precluding the determination of the core position . the apparent contraction between component c and",
    "s is clearly indicating the presence of a compact component moving towards south with apparent speed @xmath28 . if in eq .",
    "[ beta ] we consider the apparent separation velocity computed in section 3.3 and the same orientation as derived from fig .",
    "[ teta ] , we find that this knot has a mildly relativistic intrinsic velocity @xmath39 .",
    "+ with the derived values we can compute the doppler factor of the jet knot by means of : + @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the lorentz factor .",
    "+ if in eq .",
    "[ doppler ] we consider that the knot in the jet in component c is moving with @xmath39 , and it is oriented with an angle between 12@xmath5 and 28@xmath5 to the line of sight , we derive a doppler factor @xmath42 , which is consistent with the peculiarly high observed flux density shown by the central component . in the case",
    "the whole flux density of component c is attributed to a knot in the jet , we can compute the intrinsic flux density @xmath43 : + @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the observed flux density . if in eq .",
    "[ boost ] we consider the observed flux density reported in table [ flux_vlba ] , @xmath42 as derived above , and @xmath46 , we find that the intrinsic flux density of component c , i.e. core+jet region , is about 50 mjy at both 5 and 8.4 ghz , in good agreement with what expected for the central component of radio sources .",
    "+ another explanation for the misaligned source structure and its high flux density asymmetry may be caused by an inhomogeneous external environment .",
    "in fact , in the case the two jets / hotspots experience different ambient properties on the two sides of the radio source , the side hitting the most dense medium has its expansion slowed down and its radio emission enhanced , since the energy losses due to adiabatic expansion are smaller with respect to the other side .",
    "this ends up with the brighter and smaller radio component lying closer to the core .",
    "if this is the case , the model developed assuming beaming effects becomes meaningless , and the source may thus be oriented even at larger angles to the line of sight , making the estimation of the intrinsic velocity an upper limit .",
    "we have presented multi - epoch vlbi and vla observations of the radio source j0650 + 6001 .",
    "the source shows a peculiar triple structure , where the outer components are misaligned with respect to the central flat - spectrum region , and show a high flux density asymmetry .",
    "the comparison between multi - epoch high spatial resolution observations indicated that the farthest components are increasing their distance with an apparent separation velocity @xmath47 . assuming that this velocity is representative of the mean separation speed , we obtain a source kinematic age of 360@xmath0170 years . on the other hand ,",
    "the distance between the central component and the southern lobe has decreased with a mean apparent contraction speed @xmath48 . to explain these peculiar characteristics",
    ", we discussed an interpretation based on relativistic beaming effects . from this analysis we drew a picture in which the source is oriented with an angle between 12@xmath5 and 28@xmath5 to the line of sight with the southern component being the approaching side of the source .",
    "the intrinsic separation velocity is @xmath49 .",
    "the apparent contraction observed between the central and the southern components may be explained in terms of a knot in the jet that dominates the radio emission of the central component , that is moving towards the southern component with a mildly relativistic intrinsic velocity @xmath39 , and with a doppler factor @xmath50 , which causes a moderate boost of its flux density .",
    "the monitoring of the flux density variability and the study of the component separations on a longer time scale will be crucial to better determine the nature of this source .",
