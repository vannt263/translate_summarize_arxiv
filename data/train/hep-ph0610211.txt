    "a very well motivated explanation for non - zero tiny neutrino mass is lepton number violation ( lnv ) at an energy scale @xmath3 much larger than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xmath4 .",
    "this leads to a majorana - type neutrino mass @xmath5 .",
    "the most popular way to introduce lnv is to add to the standard model ( sm ) sterile right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos @xmath6 , with large majorana masses ( seesaw mechanism ) . these sterile neutrinos decay in the early universe , at a temperature of the order of their mass .",
    "if the decays occur ( partially ) out - of - equilibrium and violate cp , a different number of leptons and antileptons is produced .",
    "such lepton asymmetry is efficiently converted into a baryon asymmetry by sm @xmath7-violating effects ( sphalerons ) , which are in thermal equilibrium down to temperatures @xmath8 .",
    "this mechanism to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe is known as baryogenesis via leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "let us give a semi - quantitative description of leptogenesis .",
    "in general , the interactions of the lightest rh neutrino @xmath9 erase any asymmetry created at scales larger than its mass . the lepton asymmetry from @xmath9-decays is defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the sm lepton and higgs doublets .",
    "the asymmetry arises from the interference between tree level and one loop feynman diagrams for the decays of @xmath9 , which are shown in fig.[lhlepto ] .",
    "cosmological data determine the baryon number density over entropy ratio , @xmath13 . in the case of thermal leptogenesis",
    "one finds @xmath14 , where the washout factor @xmath15 is at most of order one ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as a consequence",
    ", a sufficient baryon asymmetry can only be produced for @xmath16 .",
    "indicating with @xmath17 the typical size of @xmath6 yukawa couplings to lepton doublets and calling @xmath18 the mass of @xmath6 , a rough estimate gives @xmath19 a very similar combination of parameters determines light neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism : @xmath20 since @xmath21 , the comparison of eqs.([eps ] ) and ( [ mnu ] ) and the requirement @xmath22 implies @xmath23 gev @xcite .",
    "this means that leptogenesis may be successful only if it takes place at super - heavy scales .",
    "qualitatively the same lower bound on the leptogenesis scale persists @xcite in models including the contribution to @xmath24 from @xmath1 triplet scalars ( type ii seesaw mechanism ) .",
    "even a fine - tuned cancellation between the type i and ii seesaw contributions to @xmath24 does not help , since the relation @xmath25 still holds @xcite .",
    "the need for a super - heavy scale is phenomenologically unpleasant , since it is not directly accessible experimentally .",
    "moreover , in most ( unified ) extensions of the sm , the neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath26 are related to those of charged fermions , therefore one expects @xmath26 to have a hierarchical structure .",
    "this implies a further suppression of @xmath27 , which may prevent successful leptogenesis even at super - heavy scales .",
    "finally , a reheating temperature @xmath28 larger than @xmath29 is needed in order for thermal leptogenesis to occur .",
    "if one invokes supersymmetry above the scale @xmath4 , in particular to stabilize the large hierarchy @xmath30 , then @xmath31 gev leads in general to overproduction of gravitinos , in severe tension with cosmological data ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the lower bound on the leptogenesis scale can be circumvented by some strong tuning of parameters : if the two lightest rh neutrinos are quasi - degenerate in mass , eq.([eps ] ) does not hold and the asymmetry @xmath27 may be resonantly enhanced . as a consequence , the leptogenesis scale @xmath32 can be as small as @xmath2 tev ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this case the @xmath26 couplings should be also tuned , since the contributions @xmath33 to @xmath24 need to cancel each other . in this",
    "talk we do not consider the resonant scenario , rather we develop a minimal alternative .",
    "the non - zero neutrino masses and leptogenesis require to add several ingredients to the sm : new sterile leptons , a super - heavy scale for their mass , yukawa couplings between them and sm lepton doublets .",
    "one may wonder if a complete theory , which naturally accommodates these ingredients , does contain other sources of lepton asymmetry .",
    "if this were the case , some of the constraints discussed in the previous section could be evaded .",
    "let us begin by asking what scalar multiplets couple a rh neutrino @xmath34 to the sm leptons @xmath11 and @xmath35 . in full generality , the two yukawa interactions read @xmath36 where @xmath37 has the quantum numbers of the sm higgs , while @xmath0 is a @xmath1 singlet with charge @xmath38 . in the usual leptogenesis scenario only the coupling @xmath26 is considered .",
    "however , if @xmath0 is lighter than rh neutrinos , the coupling @xmath39 allows for the alternative decay channel @xmath40 , which may provide a new source of lepton asymmetry @xcite .",
    "notice that only @xmath1 singlet particles are involved in the decay . in general , the charged singlet @xmath0 may couple also to sm left - handed leptons as @xmath41 where the matrix @xmath42 is antisymmetric .",
    "several simple extensions of the sm contain the singlet @xmath0 :    * in @xmath43 models , @xmath0 is part of the higgs multiplet @xmath44 . * in left - right symmetric models , based on the gauge group @xmath45 , there are two possibilities : either @xmath46 or @xmath0 can be identified with the singly charged component of an @xmath47 triplet @xmath48 . * in so(10 ) models , which contain the left - right symmetric group , the two possibilities correspond to @xmath49 or @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the coupling ( [ yl ] ) is forbidden by the gauge symmetry in the case @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "let us consider the minimal left - right symmetric model .",
    "the rh triplet @xmath53 couples to rh lepton doublets @xmath54 as @xmath55 the vacuum expectation value @xmath56 of the @xmath53 neutral component breaks @xmath47 and gives mass to the rh neutrinos . at the same time , the interaction ( [ yd ] ) contains the second term in eq.([ynr ] ) , so that @xmath57 and @xmath39 are identified .",
    "the rh neutrino mass matrix @xmath58 and the coupling matrix @xmath59 are diagonalized at the same time , therefore there is no flavor mixing in the rh sector : the @xmath60-th rh neutrino @xmath6 decays only into @xmath61 and no lepton asymmetry is generated . to achieve leptogenesis , one has to resort to less minimal models , e.g. , ( i ) to introduce a second @xmath47 triplet ; ( ii ) to admit a source of rh neutrino masses other than @xmath56 ; ( iii ) to add a @xmath0 which is singlet under both @xmath1 and @xmath47 .",
    "in this section we compute the lepton asymmetry generated in the decays of the lightest rh neutrino through the @xmath39 coupling , @xmath62 .",
    "we assume @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the mass of @xmath0 . in the opposite case",
    "a lepton asymmetry would be produced in @xmath0 decays , but it would be washed out by @xmath6 interactions as well as by gauge scattering ( more details in @xcite ) .        the decay of @xmath9 occurs through the same tree and one loop feynman diagrams as the usual leptogenesis , by replacing @xmath65 with @xmath66 as well as @xmath12 with @xmath0 , as shown in fig.[rhlepto ] . while @xmath12 has zero lepton number , the lepton number of @xmath0 has to be determined by its dominant decay channel .",
    "the interaction @xmath42 given in eq.([yl ] ) leads to the two - body decay @xmath67 , so that @xmath68 . if @xmath42 is forbidden , than @xmath0 may only decay into three bodies through a virtual @xmath34 .",
    "the dominant channel turns out to be @xmath69 @xcite , so that @xmath70 . in both cases , a net lepton number is produced in the decay @xmath71 and therefore a lepton asymmetry may be generated .",
    "we call this scenario rh sector leptogenesis .",
    "of course @xmath9 decays also through the usual yukawa coupling @xmath26 . for simplicity ,",
    "in the following we will not display this additional contribution to the lepton asymmetry .",
    "in fact , it is negligible as long as @xmath72 gev , as demonstrated in section 1 .",
    "we consider for definiteness only one rh neutrino heavier than @xmath9 ( the results can be immediately generalized to an arbitrary number of rh neutrinos ) .",
    "the computation of the lepton asymmetry then gives @xmath73 up to corrections of order @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the quantity @xmath76 is of the order of the yukawa couplings of @xmath77 to @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath9 decay width is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is of the order of the yukawa couplings of @xmath9 to @xmath66 . in order to suppress washout from @xmath9 inverse",
    "decays , one has to impose the out - of equilibrium condition @xmath80 , where @xmath12 is the hubble constant . requiring also @xmath81",
    ", we find the constraint @xmath82 therefore , rh sector leptogenesis is successful even for @xmath29 much smaller than @xmath83 gev , provided a hierarchy in the yukawa coupling matrix @xmath39 is assumed . in particular , @xmath29 as light as few tevs requires @xmath84 , which is comparable with observed hierarchies in charged fermion yukawa matrices .",
    "we checked that other sources of asymmetry washout ( in particular @xmath85 scattering due to @xmath77 exchange ) are also under control down to these low scales @xcite .",
    "an illustrative set of parameters leading to successful leptogenesis is the following : @xmath86 in fact , leptogenesis can be successful for @xmath64 as small as allowed by direct searches at collider ( @xmath87 gev ) .",
    "the lightest rh neutrino mass @xmath29 needs to be few times larger than @xmath4 to allow for lepton to baryon asymmetry conversion by sphalerons .",
    "the mass @xmath88 has to be heavier than @xmath89 tev to suppress the washout induced by @xmath77 mediated @xmath85 scatterings ( for this estimate we did not consider the additional resonant enhancement of the asymmetry which may occur if @xmath90 ) .",
    "let us restate the reason why the scale of rh sector leptogenesis can be much lower than in the usual leptogenesis scenario .",
    "in the present case eq.([eps ] ) is replaced by @xmath91 and @xmath76 can be taken relatively large without inducing any neutrino masses , which depend only on @xmath26 as in eq.([mnu ] ) .",
    "in other words , barring resonant effects , tev scale rh neutrinos require very small @xmath26 couplings and leptogenesis at low scale may occur only if another set of couplings ( @xmath39 ) is introduced in the theory .",
    "contrary to the resonant leptogenesis scenario , no states quasi - degenerate in mass are needed , nor cancellations between @xmath26 couplings .",
    "the price to pay is to introduce an extra degree of freedom , the scalar @xmath0 .",
    "leptogenesis relies on the assumption that heavy rh neutrinos exist . in the usual scenario",
    ", they decay into a lepton doublet and the sm higgs doublet , yet to be discovered at lhc . a sufficiently light charged singlet scalar @xmath0 ,",
    "if any , would also be discovered in colliders , by drell - yan pair production : @xmath92 ( for an estimate of the cross - section see @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath0 were observed , rh leptogenesis would become as plausible as the usual one , since rh neutrinos will naturally decay into @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath0 couples ( antisymmetrically ) to left - handed leptons as in eq.([yl ] ) , it would mainly decay into antilepton and antineutrino .",
    "the decay into @xmath94 is the more interesting one , because it can be used to identify at the lhc a relatively light mssm charged higgs @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "the two particle decays can be distinguished by analyzing the angular distribution of the outgoing antilepton , since it is left - handed in the case of @xmath95 and right - handed in the case of @xmath0 .",
    "if the coupling in eq.([yl ] ) is absent , @xmath0 can decay only very slowly to three bodies .",
    "therefore , the @xmath96 pair will leave in the detector a pair of long curved charged particle tracks which could be distinguished from a muon pair by the fact that they are less relativistic .",
    "the @xmath0 exchange may also mediate lepton number violating processes . in the case of @xmath97",
    ", the dominant contribution is found to come from the @xmath42 couplings and can be as large as the present experimental limit if @xmath98 tev @xcite .",
    "if also @xmath77 is as light as few tevs , it can be produced through the relatively large yukawa coupling @xmath99 .",
    "notice that such low scales rh neutrinos in general erase any lepton asymmetry produced at higher temperatures .",
    "therefore their observation would indicate the need for leptogenesis at low scale , as allowed by our model .",
    "the usual scenario of baryogenesis via leptogenesis relates the matter - antimatter asymmetry to neutrino masses , but there is a price to pay in order to maintain such relation : a sufficient lepton asymmetry is produced only at super - heavy scale , larger than @xmath100 gev .    on the contrary , we have shown that , if rh neutrinos decay into rh charged leptons , then leptogenesis may work at scales as low as @xmath2 tev .",
    "this requires to add to the sm with rh neutrinos one charged scalar @xmath0 , singlet under @xmath1 .",
    "such particle can be easily incorporated in simple ( unified ) extensions of the sm .",
    "we called this scenario rh sector leptogenesis .    a sufficiently light @xmath0 ( at or below the tev scale )",
    "can be easily pair - produced at colliders and its decays have characteristic signatures .",
    "it may also mediate sizable lepton flavor violation processes like @xmath97 . while the lightest rh neutrino @xmath9 is very weakly coupled and therefore unobservable , @xmath77 can be also as light as few tevs and may be produced through the same sizable coupling @xmath76 that generates the lepton asymmetry .",
