    "the key to unraveling the mechanism of cuprate superconductivity is to ascertain the effective strength of correlations since pairing is widely believed to arise from electron - electron interactions rather than from the traditional electron - phonon coupling .",
    "two sharply different scenarios have been proposed and remain subject of considerable debate .",
    "one viewpoint holds that @xmath2 where @xmath1 is the hubbard @xmath1 , and @xmath3 is the bandwidth with hopping parameter @xmath4 . in this case , a ` pairing glue ' is not necessary as the pairs are bound by a superexchange interaction @xmath5 , and the dynamics of the pairs involves virtual excitations above the mott gap set by the energy scale @xmath1.@xcite in the opposing view , @xmath6 , and pairing is mediated by a bosonic ` glue ' , which originates from antiferromagnetic ( afm ) spin fluctuations@xcite .",
    "it is clear thus that the determination of the size of the effective @xmath1 and its variation with doping are essential ingredients for understanding the mechanism of superconductivity as well as the magnetic phase diagram of the cuprates .",
    "since the electronic dispersion at half filling has a gap of magnitude @xmath7 which is clearly visible in x - ray absorption ( xas ) , angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) , and optical spectra , one way to estimate the size of @xmath1 is to follow the evolution of high - energy spectral weight as a function of doping .",
    "whereas for a conventional band insulator the spectral weights of the bands above and below the gap are independent of doping , this is not the case for a mott insulator . in the latter case , for @xmath8 ,",
    "removing one electron creates _ two _ low energy holes ",
    "one from the lower hubbard band ( lhb ) , but a second one from the upper hubbard band ( uhb ) , since without an electron on the atom there is no @xmath1-penalty in adding an electron .",
    "paradoxically , as @xmath1 decreases , the rate of this anomalous spectral weight transfer ( aswt ) actually increases@xcite . for infinite @xmath1 double occupancy ( do )",
    "is always forbidden , so no matter how few electrons are in the lhb , there will be an equivalent number of holes in the uhb .",
    "in contrast , for smaller @xmath1 values do is reduced collectively , via long - range magnetic order . as the magnetic order disappears at a quantum critical point@xcite , a much higher degree of",
    "do is restored , and the uhb can completely vanish .    hence , by measuring the high energy spectral weight ( hesw ) as a function of doping , we can estimate the degree of correlation in cuprates . here",
    "we quantify these results for xas , arpes , and optical measurements , and demonstrate that the doping evolution of aswt is similar across all these spectroscopies for both electron and hole doped cuprates .",
    "moreover , the observed doping evolution is inconsistent with large @xmath1 values , and also with fixed-@xmath1 hubbard model calculations , but it is consistent with a doping - dependent effective @xmath1 of intermediate strength @xmath9 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we explain how to quantify the rate of aswt with doping , and show that similar rates are found for several different spectroscopies . in section iii",
    "we show that these rates are consistent with an intermediate coupling model of the cuprates .",
    "a discussion of the results is given in section iv , and conclusions are presented in section v.",
    "we motivate a definition of the rate of aswt with doping in fig .",
    "1(a ) . in a strongly correlated system , removing @xmath10 electrons produces ( @xmath11 ) states above the fermi level , which are distributed between @xmath12 low energy ( in - gap ) states and @xmath13 states in the uhb .",
    "then the aswt can be quantified by the coefficient @xmath14 , defined such that in this process the weight of the uhb reduces to @xmath15 and the low energy holes gain weight by @xmath16 .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is found theoretically to depend on @xmath1 such that @xmath17 for a very strongly correlated ( @xmath8 ) mott insulator , while reducing @xmath1 leads to larger values of @xmath14 .",
    "figure  1(b ) illustrates a variety of calculations of the hesw vs doping .",
    "exact diagonalization ( ed ) calculations on small clusters@xcite ( dashed lines ) find @xmath18 for the @xmath19 model or for a @xmath8 hubbard model , @xmath20 ( at low doping ) for @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 . shown also in fig",
    ".  1b are qmc results for @xmath24 , @xmath25 [ where @xmath4 and @xmath26 are hopping parameters]@xcite , which are consistent with the ed results .",
    "hence , @xmath17 confirms strong correlations and the ` no double occupancy ' ( ndo ) hypothesis , while a faster falloff ( @xmath27 ) indicates otherwise , and supports a real gap collapse model ( @xmath28 at @xmath29 ) . for an electron doped system",
    "the hesw is associated with the lhb , and is described by the mirror image of fig  1(a ) with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "shown also in fig .",
    "1(b ) is our key result , the hesw of a variety of cuprates as a function of doping , extracted from a number of spectroscopies .",
    "the results are strikingly similar over a variety of spectroscopies , as expected , but also over several families of cuprates for both electron and hole doping . shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) are xas results on la@xmath31sr@xmath32cuo@xmath33 ( lsco)@xcite , arpes on nd@xmath31ce@xmath32cuo@xmath34 ( ncco)@xcite , and optical absorption on both ncco@xcite and lsco@xcite , compared with additional xas data for lsco , ybco and tl-2201 from ref .  .",
    "all experimental measures of hesw find a rapid falloff of the spectral weight with doping , and at low doping decrease almost linearly with doping with approximately the same slope of @xmath35 , consistent with @xmath36 , suggesting that the cuprates are far from the strong correlation limit .",
    "the observed falloff supports a real gap collapse at @xmath37 .",
    "notably , the value of @xmath38 is incompatible with the measured gap at half filling .",
    "for example , optical spectra find a gap consistent with @xmath39 , but the hesw calculations for fixed @xmath24 are far from the experimental results . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental data can be explained by intermediate coupling model calculations@xcite with a doping dependent effective @xmath1 .",
    "the calculated results are plotted in fig  1(b ) as open symbols of same color as the corresponding experimental data .",
    "since the hesw is an intrinsic property of the electronic structure of cuprates , it should show up in all spectral probes , and fig .",
    "1(b ) confirms this .",
    "however , it is important to realize that the aswt will play out quite differently in different spectroscopies .",
    "first , as is clear from fig .",
    "1(a ) , there is a strong electron - hole asymmetry to the effect : the changes will be much smaller in the hubbard band which lies at the fermi level .",
    "hence , for maximum sensitivity to aswt in a hole - doped cuprate , the probe should be sensitive to empty states , and to filled states for electron - doped cuprates .",
    "thus , arpes@xcite or x - ray emission spectroscopies are well - suited for studying aswt in electron - doped cuprates , while xas is appropriate for hole - doped cuprates .",
    "optical@xcite and resonant inelastic x - ray scattering@xcite studies would work for both cases , as they measure a joint density of states . on the other hand ,",
    "compton scattering@xcite and positron annihilation@xcite will not be sensitive to aswt because these spectroscopies measure only the total spectral weight of occupied states , but not how this spectral weight gets rearranged in energy with doping . in principle , scanning tunneling microscopy@xcite could follow either sign of charge , but would require a wide energy range , @xmath402ev to see the full effect .    figure  2 illustrates how the experimental aswts of fig .",
    "1(b ) were extracted .",
    "the arpes , optical and xas data are shown as dashed lines in the upper panel of fig .  2 , and the corresponding integral , representing the electron number @xmath41 , in the lower panel of fig .  2 .",
    "in each spectrum , the uhb [ lhb for electron doping ] is denoted by a gray shaded region , and the @xmath42 [ or @xmath43 , fig .",
    "1(b ) , is defined as the integrated density over that region , starting from a cutoff frequency @xmath44 , taken as independent of doping .",
    "a complication is involved in comparing our one - band calculation with the experimental data , in that the antibonding band in cuprates lies near to other bands , and the role of the latter must be disentangled before the spectral weight can be estimated . at high energies ,",
    "we subtract off a background from the experimental spectra associated with interband transitions to higher - lying bands not included in the present one band calculations.@xcite .",
    "we use a doping - independent background contribution shown as black dashed lines in figs .",
    "1(a - c ) . in all cases",
    "we compare the data with calculations based on the qp - gw model@xcite ( solid lines ) , discussed below .    for electron doping , arpes can detect the full lhb and hence determine @xmath45 to the extent that matrix element effects are doping independent.@xcite the arpes results for ncco are compared with our theoretical results in fig .",
    "2(a ) . at half - filling the energy distribution curve ( edc ) along the nodal direction",
    "shows the so - called charge - transfer gap from the fermi level to the lhb .",
    "a significant redistribution of spectral weight is evident at @xmath46 as the lhb approaches the fermi level and by @xmath47 , virtually all of the spectral weight of the lhb has shifted to the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "the top of the lhb crosses @xmath30 at @xmath48 , forming a hole pocket , and the spectral weight near @xmath30 undergoes an abrupt increment . to extract the total spectral weight associated with the lhb we have integrated the spectral weight from @xmath49  ev to @xmath50 , fig .",
    "arpes data are available along only two high - symmetry directions , so we take their average as representative of the net spectral weight , and at each doping normalize @xmath41 to @xmath51 at @xmath30 .    in fig",
    ".  2(b , f ) , analysis of the hesw in ncco based on the optical absorption spectra@xcite proceeds similarly@xcite . there is a large mott gap below 2  ev in the undoped material , but with doping there is a strong transfer of spectral weight from the gap to low energy features  the drude peak and the midinfrared ( mir ) peak  with an isosbetic ( equal absorption ) point around @xmath52  ev . as a measure of the hesw , the effective electron number ( per cu atom ) is obtained as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the free electron mass and charge and @xmath56 is the number of cu - atoms in a cell of volume @xmath57 .",
    "the weight of the lhb is extracted as @xmath58 .",
    "a similar analysis of @xmath42 was carried out on lsco spectra@xcite in fig .",
    "2(c , g ) , and the results included in fig .",
    "these optical results are consistent with the analysis of comanac , _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath44 which separates the high - energy hubbard bands and the low - energy in - gap states coincides with the isosbetic or equal absorption point in the optical spectra i.e. , the residual charge - transfer gap .    for hole doping ,",
    "@xmath42 was determined by x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas)@xcite , which detects the empty states above the @xmath30 . in this spirit , we compare the measured xas spectra with the calculated empty - state dos in figs .",
    "2(d ) and 2(h ) .",
    "the behavior of the spectral weight transfer is very similar to the arpes result for ncco in fig .",
    "the overall similarity of the doping dependence of the excess electron [ or hole ] count @xmath41 between arpes , optical and xas experiments is striking , and is well captured in the model calculations in figs .",
    "2(e)-(h ) .",
    "the hesw plotted in fig .",
    "1(b ) illustrates one important characteristic of these curves to demonstrate the universality of the doping dependence , but the detailed agreement is clearly much more extensive .",
    "this observation motivates our choice of the cut - off frequencies in fig .",
    "2 . since experimental and theoretical values are extracted in the same way , it is simplest to chose a doping - independent @xmath44 for each spectroscopy .",
    "the natural choice is the minimum spectral weight regions evident in fig .",
    "2 , separating low and high energy scales .",
    "these correspond to the waterfall region in single particle spectra of arpes and xas or the isosbetic point in optical spectra which is also the manifestation of the waterfall effect as discussed in ref .",
    "our @xmath44 values are chosen as average values which fall near this minimum .",
    "the theoretical calculations in figs . 1 and 2 are based on the qp - gw model@xcite , an extension of our earlier hartree - fock ( hf ) model of afm gap collapse@xcite to the intermediate coupling regime by introducing a gw - like self - energy correction.@xcite    the self - energy in qp - gw model is dominated by a broad peak in @xmath59 which produces the ` waterfall ' effect@xcite in the electronic dispersion by redistributing spectral weight into the coherent in - gap states and an incoherent residue of the undressed uhb and lhb . with underdoping , the in - gap states develop a pseudogap which we model as a ( @xmath60)-ordered spin density wave .",
    "the doping evolution of both electron and hole - doped cuprates is dominated by a magnetic gap collapse near optimal doping.@xcite the present calculations are obtained with the same parameter sets as in ref .  ; in particular the doping dependence of u is shown in fig .  5 of that publication .",
    "our analysis identifies two main factors that cause aswt .",
    "firstly , the pseudogap collapses with doping , shifting the optical mir peak to low energies while transferring weight to the drude peak .",
    "secondly , the residual incoherent weight associated with the hubbard bands decreases with doping@xcite due to decrease in magnon scattering .",
    "this is reflected in the doping dependence of the peak in @xmath59 .",
    "the strength of this peak can be measured by the area under the @xmath59 curve , fig .",
    "3 . this gives a direct measure of the tendency of the spectrum to split into coherent and incoherent parts , and hence a measure of the weight of the hubbard bands .",
    "3 shows this quantity as a function of doping above and below the fermi level for both ncco and lsco . in both materials , @xmath61 below @xmath30 ,",
    "seen in arpes , shows a much faster fall - off with doping .",
    "this fast fall - off seems to terminate around @xmath62 close to the point where the hesw extrapolates to zero , @xmath63 .",
    "this is also close to the doping where afm order ends in a critical point , suggesting an intimate connection between the decrease of magnon scattering and the collapse of the afm gap .",
    "the good agreement between experiment and theory suggest that aswt is predominantly associated with electron - electron interaction.@xcite    the unusual doping dependence of the experimental @xmath42 in fig .",
    "1b can be understood within our model as follows .",
    "the magnetic gap collapses near @xmath640.2 for both electron@xcite and hole doped case@xcite , and beyond this doping there is at most only a weak dip in the density of states , indicating a separation of the band into two components  now coherent and incoherent parts .",
    "however , since we work with fixed cutoff , we count all empty states in the band above @xmath44 as part of the uhb . these change slowly with doping , decreasing linearly to zero at @xmath65 .",
    "hence the break in slope indicates the magnetic gap collapse .",
    "to better understand the failure of qmc calculations with fixed @xmath24 to explain the observed aswt , in figure 4(a - b ) we plot the dos and the associated electron count calculated in qmc@xcite . for @xmath66  ev , close to the dos minimum@xcite",
    ", @xmath42 is in good agreement with the exact diagonalization results for the corresponding @xmath24,@xcite blue stars in fig .",
    "1(b ) , but has a considerably weaker falloff than found in experiment .",
    "note that the same result would follow by choosing a doping dependent @xmath44 pinned to the dos minimum .",
    "consistent with this , we carried out a similar analysis of the xas spectra based on qmc - based dos with doping - independent @xmath24 in figs .",
    "4(c - d ) .",
    "the qmc spectra ( solid lines ) are not consistent with the experimental results , clearly overestimating the weight of the uhb for finite dopings .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in refs .  .",
    "note that the mean - field result is similar : for @xmath24 , the gap collapse would be shifted to much higher doping @xmath67.@xcite since the bare @xmath1 should be doping independent , the apparent doping dependence of the effective @xmath1 in our model arises to compensate for interactions not included in the underlying calculation .",
    "we have been able explain this doping dependence as due to long - range coulomb screening@xcite .",
    "alternatively , it should be noted that the doping dependence of @xmath1 can also be significantly reduced by going to a three - band model@xcite .",
    "indeed , it is common practice in the lda+u literature to try to calculate a screened u by incorporating interactions involving other bands or longer range coulomb interactions . in this sense ,",
    "our result is a natural extension to incorporate the doping dependence of this screening , which is particularly important near the metal - insulator transition.@xcite    however , there is an ongoing debate on this issue that we would like to address .",
    "some screening is present within the one band hubbard model , and it is important to see whether the full doping dependence of u could be understood on the basis of a more exact treatment of the hubbard model ",
    "i.e. , whether the physics of cuprates can be fully understood within a single - band hubbard model .",
    "clearly , as more correlations are added the doping dependence of the effective @xmath1 systematically decreases from hartree - fock calculations@xcite to the present qp - gw model , to recent dmft calculations that can successfully describe the doping evolution of the cuprates with fixed-@xmath1 models@xcite .",
    "however , neither exact diagonalization nor qmc with fixed @xmath24 capture the aswt , fig .",
    "1(b ) , and the doping dependence of @xmath1 was not found in recent gutzwiller calculations@xcite .",
    "indeed , by comparing the experimental results with exact diagonalization calculations , fig .",
    "1(b ) , a value @xmath68 at finite @xmath10 is indicated , consistent with our results .",
    "one way to reconcile the dmft with the qmc and exact diagonalization results might be to note that both of the latter calculations are for a pure hubbard model , neglecting band structure effects by restricting the overlap to nearest neighbor only .",
    "hence , it will be necessary to include at least a @xmath26 in the exact diagonalization and qmc calculations to ensure that all three calculations converge on a common behavior for the one - band hubbard model .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the spectral weight of the uhb [ lhb for electron - doped cuprates ] collapses with doping at a rate much faster than can be explained in a @xmath19 or @xmath69 hubbard model .",
    "such a fast falloff would seem to require a real mott gap collapse consistent with an intermediate coupling @xmath70 scenario .",
    "we find that the rate of aswt is universal  the same across several spectroscopies and many different cuprates .",
    "the plot of hesw vs doping in fig .",
    "1(b ) provides a unique signature of the effective hubbard @xmath1 in these materials .",

    "<S> we have analyzed experimental evidence for an anomalous transfer of spectral weight from high to low energy scales in both electron and hole doped cuprates as a function of doping . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray scattering , optical and photoemission spectra are all found to show that the high energy spectral weight decreases with increasing doping at a rate much faster than predictions of the large @xmath0limit calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the observed doping evolution is however well - described by an intermediate coupling scenario where the effective hubbard @xmath1 is comparable to the bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental spectra across various spectroscopies are inconsistent with fixed-@xmath1 exact diagonalization or quantum monte carlo calculations , and indicate a significant doping dependence of the effective @xmath1 in the cuprates . </S>"
