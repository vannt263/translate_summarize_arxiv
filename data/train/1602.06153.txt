    "the mathematical modeling of human crowds has gained significant attention in the last decades , see @xcite . in 2002 , roger l.  hughes @xcite proposed a ` thinking fluid ' approach to this subject , which consists in modeling a human crowd as a continuum medium , with eulerian velocity computed via a nonlocal constitutive law of the overall distribution of pedestrians .",
    "such a nonlocal dependence is encoded in a _ weighted _ distance function computed at a quasi - equilibrium regime , obeying an eikonal equation with right - hand side depending on the density of pedestrians . in its multidimensional formulation ,",
    "the model reads @xmath1 here @xmath2 denotes the position variable , @xmath3 is the time , and @xmath4 represents the averaged crowd density .",
    "the model is typically posed on a bounded domain @xmath5 , with boundary conditions depending on the position of the exits in @xmath6 , see @xcite for further details . the map @xmath7 represents the absolute value of the velocity , and is assumed to be decreasing , as lower velocities correspond to higher densities .",
    "the function @xmath8 in models the pedestrians perception of the exits , and is computed as a weighted distance encoding the overall distribution of the crowd . it may be interpreted as an estimated exit time for a given distribution of pedestrians .",
    "more precisely , pedestrians choose their direction upon evaluation of a _ running cost _",
    "function @xmath9 .",
    "such a function is assumed to be increasing , since pedestrians choose their path toward the closest exit avoiding densely crowded regions .",
    "hughes approach addresses specifically the movement of pedestrians in highly populated domains . in @xcite",
    ", the model has been suggested in particular to provide assistance in the annual muslim hajj and , quoting from @xcite , ` to locate barriers that actually increase the flow of pedestrians above that when there are no barriers present ' .",
    "such a phenomenon , analogous to a similar one known in vehicular traffic modeling , is often referred to in the literature as _ braess paradox _ for pedestrians , see @xcite .",
    "hughes model is way far from being the only significant pde - based approach to pedestrian movements , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "compared to other existing models in the literature , in addition to its potential applications listed in @xcite , this model has the undeniable advantage of combining classical overcrowding avoidance effects with singular _ direction - switching _ phenomena , which occur typically in a densely crowded region with limited information on the location of the exits .",
    "clearly , the global perception of the domain implied by the eikonal equation in is not totally realistic in most situations .",
    "however , the model is very flexible and can be easily improved to localize the range of perception , see @xcite . another argument in favour of has been recently provided in @xcite , in which a full - transient version of this model has been justified as a mean field game .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the hughes model @xcite in its one - dimensional formulation    [ eq : model ] @xmath10_x = 0 , & & |\\phi_x|=c(\\rho ) , & x \\in ( -1,1),~ t > 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] coupled with homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath11 and initial datum @xmath12    in this version of the model , two exits are located at the edges of the interval @xmath13 .",
    "it will be assumed that a maximal value of @xmath14 is prescribed , which we set equal to @xmath15 for simplicity .",
    "a preliminary _ formal _ maximum principle proved in @xcite shows that @xmath14 never exceeds the range @xmath16 $ ] if @xmath17 takes values in @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "we shall assume what follows .    * the velocity map @xmath18 \\to [ 0,+\\infty)$ ] is @xmath19 , strictly decreasing , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , there exists a @xmath22 such that @xmath23 ( \\hat\\rho - \\rho ) > 0 $ ] for all @xmath24 . * the running cost map @xmath25 \\to [ 1,+\\infty]$ ] is @xmath26 , increasing , with @xmath27 , and with @xmath28 .",
    "an important example is @xmath29 see @xcite and example  [ exe : c ] below .",
    "the boundary conditions are justified as follows .",
    "if we denote the efficiency @xmath30 $ ] of the exits by the ratio between the escape velocity allowed by the exit and the maximum pedestrian velocity , we have that the flux of pedestrians through the exit is proportional to @xmath31 , i.e. we obtain the robin type condition condition @xmath32 where the term @xmath33 gets cancelled when considering the outgoing normal direction of the flux .",
    "this is equivalent to imposing the exit velocity @xmath34 since we assume that the velocity is related to the density via a monotonic function , then imposing the velocity is equivalent to imposing the density .",
    "hence , at variance with what happens in diffusion problem in which robin boundary conditions become in the limit either dirichlet or neumann condition , in our case we simply obtain a dirichlet conditions on the density . for simplicity",
    ", we always considered the case of _ maximum _ efficiency @xmath35 , i.e.  @xmath36 , which in turn gives zero boundary conditions on the density .",
    "note however that in the cases in which the characteristics are exiting the domain , no boundary conditions have to be assigned on the boundary .",
    "a discussion about this issue is provided later on in this section . by a simple duality argument",
    ", a similar zero dirichlet condition is obtained for @xmath8 , see the discussion in @xcite .",
    "a fully satisfactory existence theory for is still missing . a mathematical theory in this setting",
    "was first addressed in @xcite , in which the eikonal equation @xmath37 was replaced by two regularised versions involving a laplacian term . in both cases ,",
    "existence of weak solutions was proved , and the uniqueness of entropy solutions was provided in one of the two cases .",
    "@xcite was the first rigorous attempt at the mathematical theory for the hughes model .",
    "the use of a regularised eikonal equation implies a @xmath19 regularity of the velocity field in the continuity equation for the density @xmath14",
    ". such a property does not hold in the non - regularized case , and the numerical simulations performed in @xcite showed evidence of discontinuities in the velocity field , expressing sudden changes of direction in the movement of the pedestrians .",
    "a first attempt at a rigorous mathematical treatment of ( without any regularization ) was performed independently in @xcite and @xcite . in both papers ,",
    "the authors provided a complete description of the behaviour of solutions for short times in the case of riemann - type initial data on an interval . in @xcite",
    "a solution semigroup was defined for short times for piecewise constant initial conditions . as a special case",
    ", solutions with direction - switching phenomena were produced analytically . in @xcite",
    "the riemann problem was analyzed more thoroughly , and the optimization of the evacuation time in that case was studied .",
    "numerical simulations were performed in @xcite and in @xcite , essentially based on godunov schemes in both papers .    the results in @xcite laid the basis for tackling the convergence of a wave - front - tracking scheme @xcite for , see the numerical simulations in @xcite .",
    "such an approach was only partly successful , and led to the results in @xcite , which show existence of entropy solutions when the initial condition is _ well - separated _ , i.e.  is yielding the formation of two distinct groups of pedestrians moving towards the two exits , with the emergence of a vacuum region in between , persisting until the total evacuation of the domain .",
    "a more general set of initial conditions was never covered so far , the main difficulty lying in the very large number of possible case studies in the interactions between classical and nonclassical waves in the wave - front - tracking algorithm .    as already observed in @xcite , the one - dimensional hughes model can be reformulated in terms of the density @xmath14 as follows : @xmath38 with @xmath39 here , @xmath40 plays the role of a _ turning point _ at which pedestrians switch their target exit in view of the overall crowd distribution .",
    "the reduction of to is soon explained . in order to have a unique",
    "physically relevant ( semi - concave ) viscosity solution to the dirichlet problem for @xmath8 , the derivative @xmath41 can change its sign just once from positive to negative .",
    "the turning point @xmath40 is then defined as the point @xmath2 at which @xmath42 reaches its maximum .",
    "@xmath43 depends on time because of the @xmath14-depending term on the right hand side of the eikonal equation in .",
    "indeed , @xmath40 depends _ non - locally _ on @xmath44 .",
    "the second equation in is recovered after a simple integration on the eikonal equation in , upon the assumption that @xmath42 is continuous at @xmath40 .",
    "notice that the flux @xmath45 is possibly discontinuous along the _ turning curve _ @xmath46 . for a detailed study of a rankine - hugoniot condition along the turning point",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the simplest choice for the cost function is @xmath47 . in this case",
    "the obvious solution to the eikonal equation in is the distance function @xmath48 for all @xmath49 . as a consequence ,",
    "the ratio @xmath33 is equal to @xmath50 for @xmath51 and to @xmath15 for @xmath52 , and the model is equivalent to the scalar conservation law with discontinuous flux @xmath53_x=0.\\ ] ] as a result , hughes model reduces to the lighthill - whitham - richards ( lwr ) model for traffic flow @xcite with negative velocity on @xmath54 and positive velocity on @xmath55 . roughly speaking",
    ", pedestrians are moving toward the closest exit regardless of the overall distribution .",
    "this is the typical behaviour of a crowd in a _ panic _",
    "state , see @xcite .",
    "[ exe : c ] in the literature , the usual choice for the cost function is @xmath56 see @xcite . in this case , in order to bypass the technical issue of @xmath57 blowing up at @xmath58 in the eikonal equation of , the initial condition @xmath17 is assumed to take values in @xmath59 $ ] , for some constant @xmath60 sufficiently small .",
    "this assumption , together with the maximum principle , ensures that the cost computed along any solution of is well defined .",
    "rewriting hughes model in the form highlights the non - local mechanism by which the overall distribution of pedestrians in the domain biases the choice of the exit path for each single pedestrian . since @xmath57 is increasing w.r.t .",
    "@xmath14 , such a mechanism penalises regions with high density in the choice of the nearest exit . in the relevant case in",
    ", @xmath61 gets very large when @xmath14 is close to @xmath15 , and the weighted distance function @xmath8 gets very steep in this case .",
    "the reformulation of in the form clearly suggests that hughes model can be seen as a two - sided first order lwr model for traffic flow @xcite , with the turning point @xmath40 splitting the whole interval @xmath13 into two subintervals .",
    "hinted by the new particle approach developed in @xcite , in which nonnegative entropy solutions to nonlinear scalar conservation laws @xmath62_x = 0 $ ] are rigorously approximated by the empirical measure of the follow - the - leader ode particle system , in which particle @xmath63 satisfies an equation of the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the mass assigned to each particle , in the present paper we propose a new _ deterministic particle _ approach to , which can be roughly formulated as follows .",

    "clearly , system must be restarted once @xmath40 crosses one of the two neighbor particles @xmath87 , @xmath88 . in this case , a detailed analysis comparing the speed of the neighbor particle with @xmath89 at the crossing time is needed in order to define the post - crossing evolution consistently .",
    "we shall refer to system as the _ ftl - hughes model_.    the goal of this paper is twofold .    * first of all we use the ftl - hughes model as a way to prove existence of weak solutions to the continuum model .",
    "we perform this task under analogous assumptions to those required in @xcite , namely in situations in which a vacuum region is generated around @xmath90 , but with a lighter proof and under more general assumptions on the cost function @xmath57 ( only the cost function @xmath91 is covered in @xcite ) . as a byproduct of our result",

    "we shall compare these simulations to existing ones in the literature @xcite based on godunov s scheme , and show that our deterministic particle approach is able to capture mass transfer phenomena around the turning point .",

    "<S> in this paper we present a new approach to the solution to a generalized version of hughes models for pedestrian movements based on a follow - the - leader many particle approximation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we provide a rigorous global existence result under a smallness assumption on the initial data ensuring that the trace of the solution along the turning curve is zero for all positive times . </S>",
    "<S> we also focus briefly on the approximation procedure for symmetric data and riemann type data . </S>",
    "<S> two different numerical approaches are adopted for the simulation of the model , namely the proposed particle method and a godunov type scheme . </S>",
    "<S> several numerical tests are presented , which are in agreement with the theoretical prediction .    </S>",
