    "understanding the magnetic susceptibility @xmath10 of the ising model as a function of the temperature remains an outstanding problem in lattice statistical physics .",
    "one of the problems raised in this model is the possibility of occurrence for @xmath10 of a natural boundary in the complex plane of the variable @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the conventional ising model coupling constant .",
    "there is a strong argument on this point , since it has been shown by nickel  @xcite that the singularities of each @xmath13particle contribution @xmath14 to the susceptibility are given by @xmath15 which are actually lying on the unit circle @xmath7 . in the following",
    ", we will call these singularities `` nickellian singularities '' .",
    "these individual @xmath16 are @xmath13particle contributions to the infinite sum  @xcite @xmath17 where the singularities ( [ nick ] ) accumulate and ( in absence of cancellation ) densify the unit circle , possibly creating a natural boundary for @xmath18 .",
    "the above sum is restricted to @xmath19 even ( respectively odd ) for the low ( respectively high ) temperature .    among these @xmath13particle contributions , @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "were known long ago , and the following two , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , have been shown recently  @xcite , to satisfy fuchsian linear differential equations of , respectively , order seven and order ten .",
    "our study is based on a _ holonomic _ approach which uses the fact that , the integrand being an _ algebraic function _",
    "of all the variables , the multiple integral under consideration , can be shown to be _ holonomic _",
    "@xcite , i.e. it satisfies finite order linear differential equations , with polynomial coefficients , in the remaining variable for which no integration has been performed .",
    "the analysis , then , focuses on the corresponding linear differential operators .",
    "this holonomic approach gives the full set of singularities as roots of the head polynomial in front of the highest derivative of the differential equation ( excluding the `` apparent '' polynomial  @xcite ) .",
    "the linear ode corresponding to @xmath24 has  @xcite , besides the known singularities @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , only the singularities ( [ nick ] ) predicted by nickel  @xcite , while the linear ode corresponding to @xmath22 has shown a pair of singularities @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 ) that are _ not _ on the unit circle @xmath29 .",
    "the condition @xmath29 is equivalent , for the variable @xmath30 , to be real and such that its absolute value is greater than @xmath31 . in this paper , by @xmath32 is `` in @xmath33 '' , we will mean @xmath34 -\\infty , -1/4 ] \\cup [ 1/4 , \\infty[$ ] .",
    "therefore , the following question is in order .",
    "should we expect in the linear ode s corresponding to the successive @xmath19-particle contribution @xmath14 , the occurrence of singularities that are of similar nature as @xmath35 , i.e. not lying in @xmath33 , or only the occurrence of the `` nickellian singularities '' given by ( [ nick ] ) ?",
    "these expected singularities of the linear ode governing the @xmath16 are not necessarily singularities of the particular solution @xmath16 .",
    "do singularities with @xmath9 occur in the @xmath16 , and accumulate , the question of a natural boundary for @xmath36 becomes of the most importance .    in previous works",
    ", we have introduced a `` connection matrix method ''  @xcite to determine if a singularity of the linear ode is actually a singularity occurring in the multiple integral .",
    "for the three - particle contribution @xmath22 , we have shown  @xcite that the two quadratic roots of @xmath37 , singularities of the linear ode , are actually _ absent in the multiple integral defining _",
    "@xmath22 written as a function of the self - dual variable @xmath32 is used , see section ( 3.3 ) and section ( 4.5 ) . ] .    in our holonomic approach ,",
    "the singularities of the multiple integrals are , thus , obtained in two steps : find the linear differential equation , then use our `` connection method ''  @xcite in order to analyze the singularities of the solutions of this ode and , especially , the singularities of that particular solution corresponding to the multiple integral .",
    "these computations may be rather cumbersome , depending on the order of the linear ode , on the number of singularities , and their distribution in the complex plane of the variable .    in particle physics , in the study of analytical properties of the @xmath38-matrix @xcite , or in feynman diagram calculations ,",
    "the amplitudes of the green functions are defined through an integral representation and depend on external kinematical invariants ( the mandelstam variables ) , the quadri - momentum in the loops being the integration variables .",
    "the singularities of these integrals are associated with physical thresholds in each of the physical regions in which they describe the process under consideration .",
    "the question of forecasting the location of the singularities of functions defined through integral representations is , thus , a general and interesting problem in mathematical physics  @xcite .",
    "an _ analytical approach _",
    "@xcite of this issue provides , by imposing conditions on the integrand , singled - out sets of complex points , as _ possible singularities _ of the _ integral_. these conditions on the integrand are called _ landau conditions _  @xcite .",
    "the singularities obtained this way are called _",
    "landau singularities_. note that , the landau singularities were introduced to be those of the _ integral _ , and that , the landau conditions are only _ necessary conditions _ for the existence of such singularities  @xcite . in fact , when this analytical @xmath38-matrix approach was flourishing in the litterature , it was not yet known  @xcite that the integrals of ( physical ) interest _ were actually holonomic _ , that is , solutions of finite order linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients .",
    "the fact that the landau singularities could have a better overlap with the singularities of the linear ode s , rather than with the singularities of the integral of interest , was a question nobody could imagine at that time .",
    "in many domains of mathematical physics  @xcite , the computation of multiple integrals like the evaluation of feynman diagrams  @xcite , or various correlation functions in quantum field theory and statistical mechanics  @xcite is an important problem .",
    "the @xmath19-particle contribution to the magnetic susceptibility of the ising model have integral representations .",
    "they are given by @xmath39-dimensional integrals  @xcite that read ( omitting the prefactor ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 valid for small @xmath32 and , elsewhere , by analytical continuation .",
    "recall that small @xmath32 corresponds to small values of @xmath3 , _ as well as _",
    "large values of @xmath3 .",
    "if successful , the landau conditions will give the singularities of these integrals bypassing the linear ode search and the singularity analyzis from our connection method  @xcite , possibly providing a deeper insight on the natural boundary problem of the susceptibility .",
    "unfortunatly , the multiple integrals ( [ chi3tild ] ) are too involved for the landau conditions to be worked out .",
    "we will consider , instead , and as a preliminary project , two kinds of functions in the form of integral representations ( one - dimensional and multidimensional ) which belong to the ising class .",
    "the integrands of this class of integrals have a trigonometric - hyperbolic form and are simple algebraic functions in the cosinus of the angular integration variables , and are also algebraic in the remaining @xmath30 variable .",
    "these integrals are thus holonomic : they must satisfy finite order linear ode s with polynomial coefficients in the remaining variable @xmath30 . the route we take for obtaining the linear ode s of the two sets of integrals will be through series expansions  @xcite .",
    "one example corresponds to a multiple integral , but yields quite simple sets of singularities , whereas the second example corresponds to simple integrals , but yields quite non trivial sets of singularities .",
    "these two `` ising class '' examples have been chosen to provide an `` equivalent level of complexity '' but complementary results on our singularity problem .",
    "for each example , we compare the singularities of the linear ode , the singularities of the integral , and the singularities given by the landau conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ( [ landau ] ) , we recall the landau equations method @xcite . section ( [ toy2 ] ) presents the first `` toy model '' for which we can obtain for _ any value _",
    "@xmath44 of this @xmath44-multiple integral , the corresponding linear ode , remarkably of second order , and the corresponding solutions . section ( [ diag ] ) introduces a second `` toy model '' of simple integrals , gives the corresponding linear ode s with their singularities , presents the landau singularities , and compares these two sets with the actual singularities of the integral . in both sections , we consider some subtleties that appear when we switch from the self - dual variable @xmath32 to the variable @xmath3 , with respect to the analytic continuations of each .",
    "we finally comment the calculations on landau conditions , sketch the forthcoming `` ising class '' integral calculations we will study , and conclude .",
    "for the paper to be self contained , we recall , in this section , general features about the landau singularities .",
    "let us , for instance , consider the following integral : @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes an algebraic function of @xmath30 and of trigonometric functions of the angles @xmath47 .",
    "denote by @xmath48 , @xmath49 , the set representing the boundary of the integration domain , and by @xmath50 , @xmath51 , the set of varieties , locus of the singularities of the integrand ( @xmath52 denotes @xmath53 ) .",
    "landau equations amount to finding the necessary conditions for the singularities to occur when the hypercontour is pinched between the surfaces of singularities ( pinch singularity ) or meets a boundary variety ( end - point singularity ) . for this to happen , the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 should exist , not all equal to zero , and such that at the point @xmath56 @xmath57 solving this set of equations will give the singularities @xmath32 that are `` candidates '' to be those of the integral ( [ theintegral ] ) . note that the easy resolution of these equations will depend on the number of integration variables and the number of singularity varieties .",
    "consider , for instance , a one - dimensional integral in the form : @xmath58 where @xmath59 represents the variety of singularities . from ( [ landaucond ] ) , the landau conditions read : @xmath60 knowing that @xmath61 and @xmath62 should not be both equal to zero , it is easy to see that the set of equations ( [ eqslandau1 ] ) gives two kinds of solutions , namely : @xmath63 the first solution corresponds to _ endpoint singularities _ while the second one corresponds to _ pinched singularities_. note that mixed situations with endpoint together with pinched singularities , can occur for multidimensional integrals .",
    "recall that a multidimensional integral of the product of the @xmath65 quantities has been recently introduced by nickel  @xcite to suggest that the singularities , like @xmath66 , appearing in  @xcite for the @xmath22 linear differential equation are _",
    "pinch singularities_.    in this section , for elegance , and less prohibitive calculations purposes , we consider , instead , a multidimensional integral of the product of @xmath67 s .",
    "the results are similar to the product of the @xmath68 s , as far as the singularities location is concerned ( see appendix a for the linear ode bearing on the product of @xmath69 with @xmath70 ) .",
    "our multidimensional integral thus reads : @xmath71 with @xmath72    to find the linear differential equations for these integrals , we make use of the fourier expansion of @xmath73 which reads ( dropping the indices ) @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a _ non terminating _ hypergeometric series given by @xmath78 the fourier expansion ( [ fourexp y2 ] ) , together with the definitions ( [ defd(k ) ] ) , ( [ defdk ] ) , allow to write the expansion of the integral @xmath79 , fully integrated over the angles , as ( see appendix b for details ) @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "series generation using ( [ fn expansion ] ) can be carried out without any difficulty .",
    "we have computed the linear differential equations satisfied by the @xmath84 s up to @xmath85 .",
    "these fuchsian linear ode s have many remarkable properties .",
    "they are of order _ two _ , _ independently _ of the dimension @xmath19 of the integral .",
    "all these fuchsian linear ode s have the singularities @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , with respectively the critical exponents @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . the singularity @xmath86 is an apparent one .",
    "these linear ode s have other regular singularities with critical exponents @xmath94 or @xmath95 .",
    "let us give , as an example , the linear ode for @xmath96 ( @xmath97 denotes @xmath98 ) @xmath99 where @xmath100 the polynomials being : @xmath101 the roots of polynomial @xmath102 are _ apparent singularities_. the linear ode for @xmath103 is given in appendix c.    this second - order linear differential equation can be solved exactly , and has the general solution ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 are arbitrary constants ) : @xmath106 each component @xmath107 is a solution of an order - one linear differential equation .",
    "all the singularities are poles , except @xmath108 which are branch points for the second component @xmath109 . for arbitrary constants of integration , the general solution @xmath97 has the same singular behavior . to obtain the particular solution corresponding to the integral ( [ deffn ] ) for @xmath110 , i.e. @xmath111 , the constants of integration have to be fixed to @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "note that , when these constants of integration are fixed at these values , the solution @xmath111 is _ no longer singular _ at @xmath114 , and at the quadratic roots @xmath115 of @xmath116 , as can be easily checked : @xmath117 however , these polynomials @xmath118 and @xmath119 still remain in the expression of the solution .",
    "note that the corresponding singularities @xmath120 and @xmath121 _ are not _ in @xmath33 , while the others in ( [ soly3 ] ) are .    as a second example , consider , for instance , the case @xmath122 .",
    "the singularities of the linear ode , besides @xmath123 , correspond to the roots of the two polynomials : @xmath124 one can check that the set of values of @xmath30 such that @xmath125 , and the singularities of the set @xmath126 , are indeed singularities of the multiple integral @xmath127 ( see below and appendix c ) , while those of the set @xmath128 are not . here also , the singularities can not be `` simplified '' due to the presence of the radical @xmath129 .",
    "one can also check that the singularities corresponding to @xmath126 are in @xmath33 , while those of the set @xmath128 are not .",
