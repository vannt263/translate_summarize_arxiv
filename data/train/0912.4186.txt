    "to answer the question of what drives confinement and other nonperturbative effects in qcd , basically three sorts of topological excitations have been intensively examined over the years : instantons , magnetic monopoles and center vortices .",
    "instantons as solutions of the equations of motion are special : they are the relevant objects in a semiclassical approach . while the generation of a chiral condensate is very natural via the ( quasi ) zero modes , confinement remained unexplained in this model .    at finite temperature , where the classical solutions are called calorons @xcite , there has been quite some progress recently , due to two effects .",
    "first of all , the asymptotic polyakov loop plays a key role determining the properties of a new type of caloron solutions ( for more details on calorons see sect .",
    "[ sect : calorons ] and the reviews @xcite ) . under the conjecture that the asymptotic polyakov loop is related to the average polyakov loop , the order parameter of confinement , calorons are sensitive to the phase of qcd under consideration .    secondly , the new calorons with nontrivial holonomy consist of @xmath1 dyons / magnetic monopoles for the gauge group @xmath2 . in this way",
    ", contact is seemingly made to the dual superconductor scenario .",
    "we stress that the dyon constituents of calorons appear in an unambiguous way as classical objects .",
    "this is in contrast to abelian monopoles and also center vortices , the other sorts of objects used to explain confinement . in the sense , that they are widely accepted , they are not of semiclassical nature .",
    "they represent gauge defects of codimension 3 and 2 , respectively , which remain after the respective gauge fixing and projection .",
    "their interrelation and the fact that they are a prerequisite for the occurrence of topological charge in general has been quantitatively studied in the past  @xcite .",
    "monopoles are usually obtained by applying the maximal abelian gauge ( mag ) .",
    "center vortices in lattice qcd can be defined through a center projection ( therefore called p - vortices ) after the lattice gauge field has been transformed into the maximal center gauge ( directly by direct maximal center gauge [ dmcg ] or indirectly by indirect maximal center gauge [ imcg ] , with the mag as preconditioner ) or into the laplacian center gauge ( lcg ) .",
    "we refer to sect .",
    "[ sect : centervortices ] for the technicalities .",
    "we would also like to mention another important development during recent years .",
    "fermionic methods have become available to study topological structures without the necessity of smoothing .",
    "singular , codimension 1 sheets of sign - coherent topological charge have been found and proposed to be characteristic for genuine quantum configurations @xcite and potentially important for the confinement property .",
    "the relation to the other low - dimensional singular topological excitations is still not completely understood . in this scenario , ( anti)selfdual objects like calorons typically appear as topological lumps after smearing @xcite , i.e.  at a resolution length bigger than the lattice spacing @xcite .    the physical mechanisms assigned to calorons would be based on their quantum weight @xcite , their moduli space metric @xcite , the particular features of their fermionic zero modes @xcite and the specific suppression of dyons according to the action they acquire in different phases @xcite .",
    "the last observation suggests an overall description of confinement @xcite and deconfinement in terms of calorons dyon constituents as independent degrees of freedom .",
    "the proposed generalized ( approximative ) moduli space metric , however , presents some difficulties @xcite which are not yet overcome .",
    "since calorons unify instanton and monopoles , it is natural to ask for the relation to center vortices . in four dimensions the latter are two - dimensional worldsheets with wilson loops taking values in the center of the gauge group if they are linked with the vortex sheet .",
    "vortices that randomly penetrate a given wilson loop very naturally give rise to an area law . since vortices are closed surfaces , the necessary randomness can be facilitated only by large vortices .",
    "this is further translated into the percolation of vortices , meaning that the size of the ( largest ) vortex clusters becomes comparable to the extension of the space itself .",
    "this percolation has been observed in lattice simulations of the confined phase @xcite , while in the deconfined phase the vortices align in the timelike direction and the percolation mechanism remains working only for spatial wilson loops @xcite .",
    "this parallels percolation properties of monopoles .",
    "moreover , it conforms with the observation at high temperatures that the spatial wilson loops keep a string tension in contrast to the correlators of polyakov loops .    in this paper",
    "we will merge the caloron and vortex picture focussing on two aspects : _",
    "( i ) _ to demonstrate how the vortex content of individual calorons depends on the parameters of the caloron solution  in particular the holonomy  and _ ( ii ) _ to obtain the vortices in corresponding caloron ensembles and analyze their percolation properties . for simplicity we will restrict ourselves to gauge group @xmath0 .",
    "we will mainly use lcg , which has found a correlation of vortices to instantons cores in @xcite .",
    "we recall that lcg has been abandoned for finding vortices in @xmath0 monte carlo configurations because the vortex density did not possess a good continuum limit @xcite .",
    "this observation does not invalidate the application of lcg to smooth ( semiclassical ) field configurations .",
    "we also compare with results obtained by dmcg and imcg . in order to enable the application of these gauge - fixing techniques we discretize calorons on a lattice , which is known to reproduce continuum results very well .    in the combination of laplacian abelian gauge ( lag ) and lcg ,",
    "magnetic monopole worldlines are known to reside on the vortex sheets , and we will confirm this for the calorons constituent dyons ( see @xcite for some first findings ) .",
    "in addition , we find another  mainly spatial  part of the vortex surfaces .",
    "it is strongly related to the twist of the dyons within the caloron .",
    "we explain this by analytic arguments that yield good approximations for the locations of these spatial vortices .    for a single caloron",
    ", both parts of the vortex system together generate two intersection points needed to constitute the topological charge in the vortex language .    in caloron ensembles we find the spatial vortex surfaces to percolate only at low temperatures ( where the holonomy is maximally non - trivial ) , while the space - time vortex surfaces are rather independent of the phase ( i.e. the holonomy ) , both in agreement with physical expectations and with observations in caloron gas simulations that have evaluated the @xmath3 free energy on one hand and the space like wilson loops on the other @xcite .",
    "from the results for individual calorons it is clear that the polyakov loop , which we treat as an input parameter for the caloron solution , is responsible for the percolation and hence the string tension in the confined phase .",
    "this lends support for the hypothesis that the holonomy is important as the `` correct background '' for the classical objects featuring in a semiclassical understanding of finite temperature qcd .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next two sections  [ sect : calorons ] and",
    "[ sect : centervortices ] we review the properties of calorons and vortices , including technicalities of how to discretize the former and how to detect the latter . in section  [",
    "sect : individualcalorons ] we describe the vortex content of single calorons . in section  [ sect : vorticescaloronensembles ] we demonstrate how the vortex content of caloron gases changes with the holonomy parameter .",
    "we conclude with a summary and a brief outlook .",
    "part of our results have been published in @xcite .",
    "calorons are instantons , i.e. selfdual yang - mills fields and therefore solutions of the equations of motion , at finite temperature . in other words ,",
    "their base space is @xmath4 where the circle @xmath5 has circumference @xmath6 as usual .",
    "as it turns out from the explicit solutions @xcite , calorons consist of localised lumps of topological charge density , which  due to selfduality  are lumps of action density , too . for the gauge group @xmath2",
    "one can have up to @xmath1 lumps per unit topological charge . when well separated , these lumps are static . ] .",
    "moreover , they possess ( quantised ) magnetic charge equal to their electric charge and hence are called _",
    "dyons_. consequently , the moduli of calorons are the spatial locations of the dyons , which can take any value , plus phases @xcite .",
    "another important ( superselection ) parameter of the new solutions by kraan / van baal and lee / lu @xcite is the holonomy , the limit of the ( untraced ) polyakov loop at spatial infinity , @xmath7 due to the magnetic neutrality of the dyons within a caloron , this limit is independent of the direction the limit is taken .",

    "the constituent dyons have fractional topological charges ( `` masses '' ) governed by the holonomy , namely @xmath18 and @xmath19 , cf .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] upper panel , such that  from the point of view of the topological density  the constituent dyons are identical in the case of maximal nontrivial holonomy @xmath16 .    to be more concrete , the gauge field of a unit charge caloron in the periodic gauge asymptotically vanishes and the holonomy is carried by the transition function . ] is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the t hooft tensor ( we use the convention in @xcite ) and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are ( @xmath24-periodic ) combinations of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , see appendix [ app_functions ] and @xcite .",
    "they are given in terms of the distances @xmath26 from the following constituent dyon locations @xmath27 which we have put on the @xmath28-axis with the center of mass at the origin ( which can always be achieved by space rotations and translations ) and at a distance of @xmath29 to each other .    in case of large @xmath30 ,",
    "the action consists of approximately static lumps ( of radius @xmath31 and @xmath32 in spatial directions ) near @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the small @xmath30",
    "limit the action profile approaches a single 4d instanton - like lump at the origin . in ref .",
    "@xcite one can find more plots of the action density of @xmath0 calorons with different sizes and holonomies .    in the far - field limit , away from both dyons",
    "the function @xmath35 behaves like @xmath36 \\ , , \\label{eq : eqn_ff_chi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and hence the off - diagonal part of @xmath37 decays exponentially , while the abelian part from @xmath38 becomes a dipole field @xcite .    the polyakov loop in the bulk plays a role similar to an exponentiated higgs field in the gauge group : it is @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the vicinity of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] lower panel .",
    "the existence of such points is of topological origin @xcite .",
    "thus the polyakov loop is a more suitable pointer to the constituent dyon locations , which agrees with the maxima of topological density for the limiting case of well - separated dyons , but is valid even in case the two topological lumps merged into one for small @xmath30 .    ) and polyakov loop ( bottom ) in the @xmath41-plane ( measured in units of @xmath9 ) at @xmath42 for a caloron with intermediate holonomy @xmath43 and size @xmath44 as discretized on a @xmath45 lattice .",

    "the dyon locations are @xmath46 and @xmath47.,title=\"fig : \" ]      a less - known feature of the caloron we want to describe next is the taubes twist .",
    "it basically means that the gauge field of one of the dyons is rotated by a time dependent gauge transformation ( rotated in the direction of the holonomy , here the third direction in color space ) w.r.t .  the gauge field of the other dyon when they are combined into a caloron",
    "this is the way the dyons generate the unit topological charge  @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to reveal the twist is to consider the limit of well - separated dyons , i.e. when their distance @xmath48 is much larger than their radius @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "let us consider points near the first dyon , @xmath49 , where the distance @xmath50 is small compared to the separation @xmath48 , but not necessarily compared to the dyon size .",
    "then the relevant distances are obviously @xmath51 in the appendix we derive the form of the functions @xmath22 and @xmath35 in this limit , @xmath52 the large factors of @xmath53 cancel in the expressions @xmath54 and @xmath55 relevant for @xmath37 , .    in the vicinity of the other dyon , @xmath56 , with @xmath57 we get very similar expressions with @xmath58 replaced by @xmath59 and @xmath60 by @xmath61 , but the time - dependent phase factor",
    "is absent , @xmath62 this staticity of course also holds for @xmath37 of this dyon and all quantities computed from it .    plugging in those functions into the gauge field of eq .",

    "the polyakov loop values inside the dyons are obtained from @xmath67 and @xmath68 which results in @xmath69    actually , the gauge field around @xmath34 is that of a static magnetic monopole with the higgs field @xmath70 identified with @xmath71 through dimensional reduction .",
    "indeed , it vanishes at the core according to ( [ eq : eqn_polloop_second ] ) and approaches the `` vacuum expectation value '' @xmath72 away from the core .",
    "accordingly , @xmath73 is identified with @xmath74 , and the bogomolnyi equation with the selfduality equation .",
    "the gauge field around @xmath33 is that of a twisted monopole , i.e.  a monopole gauge rotated with @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding higgs field is obtained from that of a static monopole by the same @xmath75 , transforming in the adjoint representation .",
    "therefore , the higgs field @xmath70 of the twisted monopole agrees with the gauge field @xmath71 apart from the inhomogeneous term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqn_relation_a_3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath70 vanishes at the core , too , and approaches the vacuum expectation value @xmath76 .",
    "the electric and magnetic charges , as measured in the @xmath70 direction through the t hooft field strength tensor , are equal and the same for both dyons .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that selfdual configurations fulfilling the bps bound must have positive magnetic charge .",
    "these fields are in some unusual gauge : around the dyon cores the higgs field has the hedgehog form @xmath77 which is called the radial gauge . far away from the dyons",
    "the higgs field @xmath70 becomes diagonal up to exponentially small corrections .",
    "indeed , if one neglects the exponentially small @xmath35 s of ( [ eq : eqn_fields_first_tc ] ) and ( [ eq : eqn_fields_second_tc ] ) and replaces the hyperbolic cotangent by @xmath78 in the denominator of ( [ eq : eqn_fields_first_phi ] ) and ( [ eq : eqn_fields_second_phi ] ) , this would be the so - called unitary gauge with diagonal higgs field and a dirac string singularity ( along the line connecting the dyons ) . far away from the caloron s dyons ,",
    "however , the `` hedgehog '' @xmath70 is not `` combed '' compeletely and there is no need for a singularity written down in sect .",
    "iia of @xcite is diagonal and @xmath79 has a singularity at the @xmath28-axis . ] .",
    "in other words the covering of the color space happens in an exponentially small but finite solid angle .",
    "more precisely , the higgs field @xmath70 approaches @xmath80 and @xmath81 away from the static and twisting dyon , respectively , for almost all directions .",
    "these values differ by @xmath82 , and hence the corresponding @xmath71 s can be glued together ( apart from a gauge singularity at the origin ) .",
    "moreover , in @xmath71 the leading far field corrections to the asymptotic value , namely monopole terms , are of opposite sign w.r.t .  the fixed color direction @xmath83 and",
    "therefore do not induce a net winding number in the asymptotic polyakov loop .",
    "hence the holonomy is independent of the direction .",
    "we remind the reader that this subsection has been dealing with the limit of well - separated dyons , i.e. all formulae are correct up to exponential corrections in @xmath84 and algebraic ones in @xmath85 .      in",
    "order perform the necessary gauge transformations or diagonalizations of the laplace operator in numerical form we translate the caloron solutions  and later caloron gas configurations  into lattice configurations . for a space - time grid",

    "( [ eq : eqn_a_caloron ] ) ) .",
    "practically , the integral @xmath90 is decomposed into at least @xmath91 subintervals , for which the exponential ( [ eq : link_expression ] ) is obtained by exponentiation of @xmath92 with @xmath93 evaluated in the midpoint of the subinterval .",
    "these exponential expressions are then multiplied in the required order ( from @xmath94 left to @xmath95 right ) .",
    "a necessary condition for the validity of this approximation is that @xmath96 with @xmath30 characterizing the caloron size or a typical caloron size in the multicaloron configurations .",
    "still this might be not sufficient to ensure that the potential @xmath97 is reasonably constant within the subinterval of all links and give a converged result .",
    "in particular , the gauge field ( [ eq : eqn_a_caloron ] ) is singular at the origin and has big gradients near the line connecting the dyons , as visualised in fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "hence we dynamically adjust the number of subintervals @xmath1 for every link , ensuring that further increasing @xmath1 would leave unchanged all entries of the resulting link matrix @xmath88 .",
    "the lattice field constructed this way is not strictly periodic in the three spatial directions , but this is not important for the lattices at hand with @xmath98 .",
    "the action is already very close to @xmath99 , the maximal deviation occurs for large calorons ( @xmath100 ) and is about 15 % .",
    "lateron , we will make heavy use of the lowest laplacian eigenmodes in the lcg . when computing these modes in the caloron backgrounds we enforce spatial periodicity by hand . in maximal center gauges",
    "we also consider the caloron gauge field as spatially periodic .",

    "we find that vortices in the deconfined phase tend to align in the time - like direction , while in the confined phase vortices percolate in the spatial directions .",
    "we remind the reader that we distinguish the different phases by the values of the holonomy , @xmath279 vs. @xmath16 , and not by different temperatures , which would lead to different caloron density and size distribution .",
    "we start our interpretation of these results by the fact that the caloron background is dilute in the sense that the topological density is well approximated by the sum over the constituent dyons of individual calorons ( of course , the long - range @xmath280 components still `` interact '' with the short - range @xmath281 components inside other dyon cores ) .",
    "therefore it is permissible and helpful to interpret the vortices in caloron ensembles as approximate _ recombination of vortices from individual calorons _ presented in the previous sections .",
    "indeed , the space - time vortices resemble the dyon - induced vortices which are mostly space - time like and therefore line - like at fixed @xmath24 .",
    "the spatial vortices , on the other hand , resemble the twist - induced bubbles in individual calorons .",
    "following the recombination interpretation , the bubbles should become larger and larger when the holonomy approaches the confining holonomy @xmath16 , where they degenerate to flat planes .",
    "this is indeed the case in caloron ensembles : towards @xmath16 the individual vortices merge to from one big vortex , see also the schematic plot fig .  7 in @xcite",
    "in other words , _ the maximal nontrivial holonomy has the effect of forcing the spatiall vortices to percolate_. consequently the vortices yield exponentially decaying polyakov loop correlators , the equivalent of the wilson loop area law at finite temperature ( see below ) .",
    "note also that there is no similar scenario for the space - time vortices .",
    "the dyon - induced vortices in each caloron are either always as large as the lattice ( in the singlet case ) or are always confined to the interior of the caloron ( in the doublet case ) .",
