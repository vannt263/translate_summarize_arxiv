    "investigation of the properties of electronic systems in reduced dimensionality is the subject of ongoing active studies , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "the effects of electronic interaction play a major role in one spatial dimension and lead to a formation of the luttinger liquid state @xcite .",
    "the idealized luttinger liquid is best described in terms of its excitations within the bosonization approach .",
    "the imperfections in quantum wires , such as impurities , are thoroughly investigated by different methods , see @xcite and references therein . in view of potential technological applications ,",
    "it is also desirable to theoretically analyze junctions of several quantum wires .",
    "such analysis for the simplest variant of y - junction connecting three wires was performed in a number of papers during the last decade .",
    "these works divide into two groups .",
    "the first group considers the problem in the bosonization approach , which allows one to fully take into account the bulk fermionic interaction .",
    "the shortcoming of this approach is the necessity to consider the y - junction close to certain values of its transparency , as discussed below .",
    "another group employs the conventional fermionic description for rather arbitrary y - junctions , @xcite and the drawback of these method is a finite order of fermionic interaction which can be taken into account .",
    "recently , a method for the fermionic description of luttinger liquid with a single impurity was developed , @xcite which performs a partial summation of fermionic diagrams in the scattering states approach .",
    "this method allows one to obtain the exact scaling exponents known previously from the ( abelian ) bosonization technique .",
    "it is possible to extend this method , formulated essentially in terms of non - abelian bosonization , for the analysis of y - junction , @xcite and to compare its predictions with those partly available from numerical and bosonization studies .",
    "but before undertaking the study of the interacting case , it is necessary to clearly specify the restrictions on the transparency of y - junction , which occur already at the level of free electrons and which are imposed by the basic quantum mechanical principles .",
    "the @xmath1 s - matrix describing the y - junction belongs to su(3 ) group and consequences of it are sometimes not trivial . as we show below",
    ", the phase space for observable conductances ( transparencies ) is four dimensional ( 4d ) and the values fill the solid body of unusual shape inside the 4d unit sphere .",
    "importantly , only six points of this body lie on the surface of such a sphere , which implies that the abelian bosonization analysis can be done in close vicinities of these points only .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ sec : setup ]    we consider a following setup : three semi - infinite non - interacting wires are connected by the y - junction .",
    "the electron gas inside the wires is subject to transverse dimensional quantization , so that only one channel per wire is available .",
    "we consider spinless fermions for simplicity . as usual ,",
    "when interested in the response at smallest energies , we can linearize the electronic dispersion around the fermi level . in the present case , instead of defining right- and left - movers in each wire , it is more appropriate to speak of incoming and outgoing waves , with respect to y - junction at the origin .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath2 with the fermi velocity @xmath3 set henceforth to unity .",
    "we unfold the setup in the usual way , @xcite by saying that the outgoing fermions on the negative @xmath4-axis are the fermions , which have passed through the junction , at positive @xmath5 , i.e.  @xmath6 .",

    "( 10.17 ) in @xcite ) . in these cases",
    "@xmath57 is orthogonal , @xmath256 , and one may promote the above equality for the averages to the operator form , @xmath257 .",
    "then the commutation relations for the chiral fields , @xmath258 = \\tfrac i{2\\pi }   \\delta_{jk}\\delta'(x - y)$ ] , prescribed in bosonization , are fulfilled also for @xmath259 .    in ( abelian ) bosonization approach , the consistent perturbative analysis can be done only in a close vicinity of the rg fixed point , which is scale invariant or conformally invariant point in 1d .",
    "@xcite the requirement for the above matrices ( [ m12 ] ) to represent the rg fixed point in bosonization leads to additional boundary conditions for three chiral densities at the y - junction .",
    "these boundary conditions are expressed via a set of neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions for appropriate bosonic fields .",
    "an important observation , made in ref .  [ ] , is that the trace of the matrix @xmath231 at the fixed point is an integer number and equal to the number of neumann conditions imposed . in simple words , @xmath260 ,",
    "at the fixed point should be equal to the number of wires , detached from the @xmath119 junction ; it becomes rather obvious when we recall that @xmath261 .",
    "evidently , the number of detached wires can be @xmath262 , but not 2 .",
    "the fixed points discussed in bosonization approach include the above @xmath126 point , @xmath263 for three detached wires ; the @xmath183 point , @xmath264 for the third wire detached , and also @xmath265 for situations with the first and second wires detached , points @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "two chiral fixed points @xmath203 , present in the broken time - reversal case , are @xmath266 ; we have zero detached wires in this case .",
    "however , formally there is seventh fixed point , first discussed in @xcite and denoted as @xmath267 in @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath268 . from our eq .",
    "( [ defgprime ] ) we have @xmath269 , @xmath270 , i.e.  the value of one - terminal conductance @xmath115 at the @xmath271 point is larger than the maximum value of unity for the non - interacting situation .",
    "this enhanced value of conductance was interpreted as the signature of andreev reflection and multiparticle scattering at the y - junction .",
    "@xcite we observe that for @xmath271 point one has @xmath272 , and it contradicts the charge conservation law both in quantum mechanical and classical formulation , at least for free fermions . indeed , we should have @xmath222 for any unitary @xmath0-matrix , and for any doubly stochastic matrix , representing kirchhoff s rule .",
    "one might argue , that our analysis , performed for free fermions , is inapplicable to the case of strongly interacting regime , where the importance of @xmath271 point was emphasized .",
    "it was predicted in @xcite that the fixed point @xmath271 becomes _ stable _ at strong attraction between fermions , @xmath273 , whereas it is unstable at weaker interaction , @xmath274 ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of @xmath271 point , however , was not ruled out for any values of interaction and , particularly , in the free fermion limit , @xmath275 .",
    "the inspection of formulas ( 10.29)(10.31 ) in @xcite and eq .",
    "( 62 ) in @xcite for the scaling dimension of leading perturbations confirms it .",
    "therefore we have to conclude , that the discussed boundary for physical conductances was not so far detected by means of conventional bosonization .",
    "one possibility here , potentially favorable for the existence of @xmath271 point , is that this boundary changes with the luttinger parameter @xmath276 and thus should be separately discussed for each value of @xmath276 .",
    "another possibility , supported by our analysis in @xcite , is that the boundary determined for free fermions remains the same for any interaction strength .",
    "particularly , any physical rg fixed point belongs to this boundary , while the above fig .",
    "[ fig : deltoid]b and the fig .",
    "5 in @xcite depict the same parabola .",
    "from this latter viewpoint , the discussed @xmath271 point lies outside the physical domain and is not connected with the inside of the body in fig .",
    "[ fig : tetrahedron ] by any rg flow . as was already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : stability ] , we assume the infinite non - interacting leads beyond the finite region of interaction , which setup provides the proper definition of @xmath0-matrix and vanishing vertex corrections to conductance .    based on the above observations i make a following stronger conjecture . the two classes ( [ m12 ] )",
    "do not represent any physical realization of @xmath119-junction , except for six points listed above and corresponding to permutation matrices in eq .",
    "( [ permutmat ] ) .",
    "these six points are the extreme points of the four - dimensional body , whose three - dimensional projections are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tetrahedron ] .",
    "all other physical realizations of the @xmath119-junction lead to values @xmath201 lying strictly inside the four - dimensional unit sphere , eqs .",
    "( [ restr - xyz ] ) , ( [ restrict ] ) , whose surface is needed as a starting point in bosonization .",
    "thus the abelian bosonization study of the @xmath119-junction can be performed at six rg fixed points only , at the vertices of the body in fig .",
    "[ fig : tetrahedron ] . if the rg fixed point occurs at the boundary of this body instead , then it is unsuitable for conventional bosonization analysis .",
    "it should be stressed again , that this conjecture is based on the present free - fermion analysis and on the results of perturbative two - loop rg treatment valid for relatively weak interaction .",
    "@xcite the case of strong interaction is to be discussed elsewhere .",
    "@xcite      the observations reported in this paper for the y - junction , can be generalized for a larger number of semi - wires , @xmath277 , attached to one spot .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix in this case will be given by a finite rotation matrix in @xmath278 group , and the squares of its entries form the unistochastic matrix @xmath231 .",
    "the set of all such @xmath231 lies within a set of bistochastic matrices , whose extreme points are @xmath279 permutation matrices , according to the birkhoff - von neumann theorem .",
    "these permutation matrices describe the physical situations when some of the wires are detached from the central spot , whereas the other semi - wires form either ideal wires ( in case of pairwise partial permutations ) or chiral groups , involving three or larger number of semi - wires . for example",
    ", for @xmath280 ( see also @xcite ) we obtain @xmath281 matrices , which correspond to 4 detached wires ( one point in phase space ) , 2 detached wires and one full wire ( six points ) , one detached wire and a chiral group of three semi - wires ( eight points ) , two full wires ( three points ) , and a chiral group of four semi - wires ( 3!=6 points ) .",
    "these points lie on an appropriate unit hyper - sphere and thus are suitable as fixed points in abelian bosonization .",
    "we note also that the particular case of fully symmetric @xmath0-matrix and fully symmetric interacting wires can be solved within tba approach @xcite for any @xmath126 , because the high symmetry effectively reduces this case to @xmath282 .",
    "the latter approach allows to consider the rg fixed point , corresponding to the perfectly transmitting junction ( @xmath118 in our above case @xmath283 ) .",
