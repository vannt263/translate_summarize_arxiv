    "scalar fields @xmath6 whose lagrangians are non - canonical are candidates for @xmath7essence fields that give rise to dark energy .",
    "the general form for such lagrangians is proportional to @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "relevant literature for such fields in cosmology , inflation , dark matter , dark energy and strings can be found in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a natural question is whether the standard cosmology is modified if we take into account the presence of dark energy while building up the friedman equations . in this context",
    "it has to be further remembered that dynamical solutions of the @xmath10-essence equation of motion changes the metric for the perturbations around these solutions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the perturbations propagate in an emergent spacetime with metric @xmath11 different from ( and also not conformally equivalent to ) the gravitational metric @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath11 now depends on @xmath6 .",
    "hence we have to determine the analogue of the friedman equations in the context of dark energy in an emergent gravity scenario .",
    "the motivation of this work is to seek plausible answers to the above question . taking the background metric to be flrw",
    ", we obtain the modifications of the standard cosmological parameters in the radiation dominated , matter dominated and dark energy dominated phases of the universe .",
    "the dark energy density is identified with the kinetic energy @xmath0 of the @xmath7essence field .",
    "the standard cosmological parameters are retrieved when @xmath13 , i.e. , the dark energy vanishes .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : section 2 introduces emergent gravity concepts , section 3 discusses the emergent gravity equations of motion , section 4 contains the analogues of the friedman equations in the presence of dark energy , section 5 discusses the solutions of the resulting cosmological equations arising from emergent gravity equations of motion and the analogue of the friedman equations and section 6 comprises of our conclusions .",
    "the @xmath7essence scalar field @xmath6 is minimallly coupled to the gravitational field @xmath14 and the action is : s_k[,g_]= d^4x -g l(x , ) [ eq:1 ] where @xmath9 and the energy momentum tensor for the @xmath7essence scalar field is : t _",

    "we first carry out the conformal transformation @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "then the inverse metric of @xmath20 is g_=l_xc_s[g_-c_s^2l_xxl_x _ _ ] [ eq:5 ] a further conformal transformation @xmath21 gives    speed @xmath22 to be positive definite and only then equations @xmath23 is physically meaningful .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "@xmath24 implies that @xmath25 does not depend on @xmath26 so that in equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , @xmath27 .",
    "so the @xmath7essence lagrangian @xmath25 becomes pure potential .",
    "then the very definition of @xmath7essence fields is meaningless because such fields correspond to lagrangians where the kinetic energy dominates over the potential energy .",
    "so lagrangian can not be pure potential .",
    "also , the very concept of minimally coupling the @xmath7essence field @xmath6 to the gravitational field @xmath14 becomes redundant and equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) meaningless and equations ( [ eq:4]-[eq:6 ] ) ambiguous .",
    "non - trivial configurations imply @xmath28 and @xmath29 not conformally equivalent to @xmath14 .",
    "so this @xmath7essence field has properties different from canonical scalar fields defined with @xmath14 and the local causal structure is also different from those defined with @xmath14 .",
    "further , if @xmath25 is not an explicit function of @xmath6 then equation @xmath30 becomes ;",
    "-1s_k = |g^__=0 [ eq:7 ]    we take @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this is a particular case of the born - infeld lagrangian @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 i.e.@xmath35 . then @xmath36 . for scalar fields @xmath37 .",
    "so ( [ eq:6 ] ) becomes    to identify the inverse metric @xmath38 .",
    "the second conformal transformation realises the mapping onto the metric given in @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",

    "the second term originates from the @xmath7essence lagrangian and this additional term signifies additional interactions ( forces ) . the new geodesic equation in terms of @xmath43 now is + |^_=0 [ eq:10 ]",
    "take the gravitational metric @xmath14 to be flrw and assume that the @xmath7essence scalar field @xmath44 is spherically symmetric ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "then ( 8) becomes             @xmath47 .",
    "the line element becomes ds^2=(1-^2)dt^2-(a^2+( ) ^2)dr^2 + -2dtdr - a^2r^2d^2[eq:12 ] with @xmath48 .    consider a co - ordinate transformation from @xmath49 to @xmath50 so that @xcite : d = dt-()dr [ eq:13 ]    then ( [ eq:12 ] ) becomes ds^2=(1 - ^2)d^2 -[a^2+( ) ^2 + + ( )^2]dr^2 -a^2r^2d^2 + [ eq:14 ] .",

    "we have @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "now the general @xmath7essence field theoretic lagrangian @xmath83 , which explicitly depends on @xmath6 , is not equivalent to isentropic hydrodynamics because @xmath6 and @xmath26 are independent and hence the pressure can not be a function of the energy density @xmath80 only .",
    "so a pertinent question is whether we are at all justified in assuming a perfect fluid model when dark energy is present .",
    "the answer is yes because our lagrangian @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a constant , does not depend explicitly on @xmath6 .",
    "this class of models is equivalent to perfect fluid models with zero vorticity and the pressure ( lagrangian ) can be expressed through the energy density only @xcite .",

    "note that both @xmath88 reduce to the usual quantities @xmath89 @xcite when dark energy is absent , i.e. , @xmath90 .",
    "the usual friedman equations are now modified into the above two equations ( [ eq:35 ] and [ eq:36 ] ) in the presence of @xmath7essence scalar field @xmath6 .",

    "we restrict now to @xmath93 as observationally this is most likely",
    ". then the above condition reduces to @xmath94 .",
    "so the second term on right hand side must be always positive i.e. @xmath95 must be always negative .",
    "this means that @xmath96 .",
    "this criterion is consistent with the fact that the dark energy density can not increase in a matter dominated era .",
    "then , neglecting @xmath87 in ( [ eq:38 ] ) gives @xmath97 which has the solution _ d^mat= [ eq:39 ] where @xmath98 .",
    "assuming that the total energy i.e. @xmath99 is a constant , we equate this to the present epoch energy i.e. @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the matter density and scale radius at the present epoch ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "this fixes the constant @xmath104 in terms of present epoch values .    for the relativistic situation",
    "we assume again that the criterion is same as in standard cosmology , i.e. @xmath105 . here",
    "this gives the condition @xmath106 for same reasons as given in the previous case , here also the conditions are consistent .",
    "we get from ( [ eq:38])the solution _ d ^rad= [ eq:40 ] where the constant @xmath107 is fixed to be @xmath108 following same arguments as before .",
    "finally we consider the dark energy dominated scenario @xmath109 , i.e. , @xmath110 this means that here @xmath111 i.e. the dark energy density must increase .",
    "this is also consistent .",
    "equation ( [ eq:38 ] ) then leads to _ d = w [ eq:41 ] where we may choose the constant @xmath112 to be @xmath113 with @xmath114 denoting some specific epoch .",
    "therefore , the difference from the standard cosmology lies only in the fact that in our case the dark energy density ( which is being identified with the kinetic energy of the @xmath7essence field ) has the following behaviour : _ in the matter and radiation dominated eras the time rate of change of dark energy density decreases , while in the dark energy dominated epoch this rate increases . _",
    "the non - relativistic case means @xmath92 and ( [ eq:35 ] ) and ( [ eq:36 ] ) can be written as follows , + k=8ga [ eq:42 ] and    2a1 + h^2+k + 2h=0 + [ eq:43 ] eliminating @xmath115 using ( [ eq:39 ] ) , and remembering that for @xmath103 ( present epoch ) @xmath116 ( [ eq:42 ] ) becomes = 8g[_d0-_d^c ] [ eq:44 ] where _",
    "d^c=3h_0 ^ 2 [ eq:45 ] for @xmath117 ( [ eq:45 ] ) becomes _ d^c=_c+_c^2 [ eq:46 ] keeping terms upto @xmath118 only .",
    "here @xmath119 , the critical value of matter density and @xmath120 .",
    "now consider the flrw universe with @xmath93 .",
    "we get from ( [ eq:44 ] ) _",
    "d^c = 3h_o^2 [ eq:47 ] and the critical matter density becomes same as that of @xmath101 .",
    "now from ( [ eq:42 ] ) with @xmath93 , we have @xmath121 .",
    "we now take the negative square root of this equation so as to be consistent with observations .",
    "this will be borne out later .",
    "therefore , = -c^1(1-^2)^1 [ eq:48 ] where @xmath122 . using equations",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) and ( [ eq:48 ] ) we get a(t)=c^1()^2(1-^2 ) + [ eq:49 ] therefore the deceleration parameter for non - relativistic case with @xmath93 q(t)^nr=-=.

    "then the deceleration parameter for non - relativistic case becomes , q(t)^nr=(1 + 27 ^ 2 + ... ) [ eq:53 ] note that the choice of the sign of the square root ( that leads to ( [ eq:48 ] ) ) ensures that the value of the deceleration parameter for the matter dominated era is as in standard cosmology i.e. when dark energy is absent .",
    "this value is @xmath125 .",

    "again we take the negative square root of this equations from physical considerations to get = -d^12a^2(1-^2)^1 [ eq:56 ] where @xmath128 . again combining equations ( [ eq:20 ] ) and ( [ eq:56 ] )",

    "this value is @xmath129 .",
    "also choice of a positive square root is ruled out to ensure reality of the scale factor .      for this case @xmath130 and from ( [ eq:41 ] ) @xmath131 , then the modified friedmann equations ( [ eq:35 ] ) and ( [ eq:36 ] ) becomes + k=8gw [ eq:62 ] and 2a1 + a^21+k + 2a + = 8gw + [ eq:63 ] again we consider @xmath93 model of the universe , the modified friedmann equation ( [ eq:62 ] ) becomes = ^1(1-^2)^1 [ eq:64 ] where @xmath132 . now combining equations ( [ eq:20 ] ) and ( [ eq:64 ] ) we obtain ; = -^1(1-^2)^3 .",
    "[ eq:65 ] now from equation ( [ eq:64 ] ) we get the scale factor a(t)=e^dt [ eq:66 ] using above equation ( [ eq:66 ] ) we have the deceleration parameter for this case q(t)^dark=-1 + [ eq:67 ] further , using ( [ eq:65 ] ) the deceleration parameter becomes q(t)^dark=-1-^2 [ eq:68 ] as @xmath0 is positive the deceleration parameter is always negative .",
    "consider now an interesting situation .",
    "the dark energy density @xmath133 for reasons mentioned before .",

    "however , figure 1 shows that there is absolutely no agreement of the predicted values of dark energy density with the observed data @xcite at present epoch .",
    "so we reject this choice .    on the other hand ,",
