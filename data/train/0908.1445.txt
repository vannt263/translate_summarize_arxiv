    "it is well known that entanglement is a key resource for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "one now has fairly good understanding of how to produce entanglement among microscopic entities . in recent times",
    "there has been considerable interest in studying entanglement in mesoscopic and even microscopic systems @xcite .",
    "nanomechanical oscillators are beginning to be important candidates for the study of quantum mechanical features at mesoscopic scales .",
    "in fact the possibility of entangling two nanomechanical oscillators has been investigated from many different angles : such as entangling two mirrors in a ring cavity @xcite , entangling two mirrors of two independent optical cavities driven by a pair of entangled light beams @xcite , entangling two mirrors by using a double - cavity set up by driving with squeezed light @xcite , entangling two mirrors of a linear cavity driven by a classical laser field @xcite , entangling two mirrors in a ring cavity by using a phase - sensitive feedback loop @xcite , entangling two dielectric membranes suspended inside a cavity @xcite , and entangling two oscillators by entanglement swapping @xcite .",
    "other proposals do not use cavity configurations but coupling to cooper pair boxes @xcite . here",
    "we report a conceptually simple method to produce entanglement between two mirrors .",
    "our proposal enables us to trace the physical origin of entanglement .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme for entangling two movable mirrors of a ring cavity by feeding broad band squeezed vacuum light along with the laser light .",
    "the two movable mirrors are entangled based on their interaction with the cavity field .",
    "the achieved entanglement of the two movable mirrors depends on the degree of squeezing of the input light , the laser power , and the temperature of the movable mirrors .",
    "the feeding of the squeezed light has been considered to produce squeezing of a nanomechanical mirror @xcite .",
    "further pinard _",
    "et al_. @xcite have considered entanglement of two mirrors in a double cavity configuration which is fed by squeezed light - one part of the cavity is fed by light squeezed in amplitude quadrature and the other is fed by light squeezed in phase quadrature .",
    "in contrast we consider a single mode ring cavity driven by a single component amplitude squeezed light . in our scheme",
    "the entanglement can be managed by an externally controllable field which is the squeezed light .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the model , give the quantum langevin equations , and obtain the steady - state mean values . in section 3",
    "we derive the stability conditions , calculate the mean square fluctuations in the relative momentum and the total displacement of the movable mirrors . in section 4",
    "we analyze how the entanglement of the movable mirrors can be modified by the squeezing parameter , the laser power , and the temperature of the environment .",
    "the parameters chosen in the paper are from a recent experiment on optomechanical normal mode splitting @xcite .",
    "before we present our calculations , we present a key idea behind our work . for a bipartite system , a sufficient criterion for entanglement",
    "is that the sum of continuous variables satisfies the inequality @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) are the position and momentum operators for two particles , respectively .",
    "they obey the commutation relation @xmath4=i\\delta_{jk}$ ] ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "mancini _ et al_. @xcite have derived another sufficient condition for bipartite entanglement , which requires the product of continuous variables satisfies the inequality @xmath6 in this paper , we will use equation ( [ 2 ] ) to show the entanglement between the two oscillating mirrors .",
    "thus if we have a situation where the interaction occurs only via the relative coordinates @xmath7,@xmath8 , then we can hold @xmath9 at its value , says @xmath10 , before interaction and if the interaction can make @xmath11 , then the inequality ( 2 ) would imply that the mirrors 1 and 2 are entangled . in the next section",
    "we discuss how this can be achieved by using a single mode ring cavity .",
    "the system under study , sketched in figure  [ fig1 ] , is a ring cavity with one fixed partially transmitting mirror and two movable perfectly reflecting mirrors , driven by a laser with frequency @xmath12 . as the photons in the cavity with length",
    "@xmath13 bounce off the movable mirrors , they will exert a radiation pressure force on the surfaces of the movable mirrors proportional to the instantaneous photon number in the cavity .",
    "the motion of the movable mirrors induced by the radiation pressure changes the cavity s length , and alters the intensity of the cavity field , which in turn modifies the radiation pressure force itself .",
    "thus the interaction of the cavity field with the movable mirrors through the radiation pressure is a nonlinear effect .",
    "in addition , each mirror undergoes quantum brownian motion due to its coupling to its own independent environment at the same low temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the two movable mirrors are identical with the same effective mass @xmath15 , mechanical frequency @xmath16 and momentum decay rate @xmath17 , and each mirror is modeled as a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator .",
    "we further assume that the cavity is fed with squeezed light at frequency @xmath18 .    in the adiabatic limit ,",
    "the cavity field is a single mode with frequency @xmath19 @xcite , and we can neglect the retardation effect @xcite , neglect the photon creation in the cavity with moving boundaries due to the casimir effect @xcite , and neglect the doppler effect @xcite , thus the radiation pressure force does not depend on the velocity of the movable mirrors . assuming the collisions of the photons on the surfaces of the movable mirrors are elastic",
    ", the momentum transferred to the mirrors per photon is @xmath20 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] for the direction of @xmath21 ) , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the wave vector of the cavity field with @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the angle between the incident light and the reflected light at the surfaces of the movable mirrors . during the cavity round - trip time @xmath26 , there are @xmath27 photons hitting on the surfaces of the movable mirrors , so the radiation pressure force is @xmath28 . in a reference frame rotating at the laser frequency ,",

    "the parameter @xmath38 is the optomechanical coupling constant between the cavity field and the movable mirrors in units of s@xmath39 .",
    "the different signs in front of @xmath40 and @xmath41 are because the radiation pressure forces exerted on the two mirrors are opposite .",

    "the cavity field is damped by photon losses via the cavity output mirror at the rate @xmath45 , and the movable mirrors are damped due to momentum losses at the same rate @xmath17 .",
    "meanwhile , there are two kinds of noises affecting on the system .",
    "one is the input squeezed vacuum noise operator @xmath46 with frequency @xmath47 .",

    "thus @xmath117 and @xmath119 can also be simultaneously measured with infinite precision .    from equations ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) , we find @xmath120 is affected by the detuning @xmath121 , the squeezing parameter @xmath51 , the laser power @xmath43 , the cavity length @xmath13 , the temperature of the environment @xmath14 , and so on . in the following , we confine ourselves to discussing the dependence of @xmath122 on the squeezing parameter , the laser power , and the temperature of the environment .",
    "in the section , we would like to numerically evaluate the mean square fluctuations in the total displacement and the relative momentum of the movable mirrors given by equations ( [ 23 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) to show the entanglement of the two movable mirrors produced by feeding the squeezed vacuum light at the input mirror .",
    "to have fairly good idea of entanglement , we use the parameters of a recent experiment @xcite although we are aware that the cavity geometry is different : the wavelength of the laser @xmath123 nm , @xmath124 mm , @xmath125 ng , @xmath126 hz , @xmath127 hz , the mechanical quality factor @xmath128 , @xmath129 .    first we illustrate the squeezed vacuum light s effect on the entanglement between the movable mirrors .",
    "we find as @xmath130 @xmath131k , the mean square fluctuations @xmath132 , which implies that as long as the mean square fluctuations @xmath133 , there is an entanglement between the movable mirrors .",
    "the behavior of @xmath120 at @xmath134 mw is plotted as a function of the detuning @xmath121 in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "different graphs correspond to different values of the squeezing of the input light . in the case of no injection of the squeezed vacuum light ( @xmath135 ) , which means that the squeezed vacuum light is replaced by an ordinary vacuum light , we find @xmath120 is always larger than unity , the minimum value of @xmath122 is 1.027 , obviously there is no entanglement between the movable mirrors .",
    "however , if we inject the squeezed vacuum light , it is seen that entanglement between the movable mirrors occurs , meaning that there is a quantum correlation between the movable mirrors , even through they are separated in space .",
    "we also find the movable mirrors are maximally entangled as the squeezing parameter is about @xmath136 , the corresponding minimum value of @xmath120 is 0.265 .",
    "so the injection of the squeezed vacuum light leads to a significant reduction of the fluctuations in the relative momentum between the movable mirrors .",
    "this is due to the fact that using the squeezed vacuum light increases the photon number in the cavity , which leads to a stronger radiation pressure acting on the movable mirrors and enhances the entanglement between the movable mirrors .",
    "next we consider the influence of the laser power on the maximum entanglement between the movable mirrors .",
    "we fix the squeezing parameter @xmath136 , and the temperature of the environment @xmath130 @xmath131k .",
    "we have already known at this temperature , @xmath132 .",
    "thus , if the mean square fluctuations @xmath137 , the movable mirrors become entangled . the mean square fluctuations @xmath122 as a function of the detuning @xmath121 for different laser power are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "we find that significant entanglement occurs for a range of pumping powers .",
    "we now show the effect of the temperature of the environment on the entanglement between the movable mirrors .",
    "we fix the squeezing parameter @xmath136 , the laser power @xmath134 mw , and the detuning @xmath138 . the value of @xmath139 as a function of the temperature of the environment is presented in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "as the temperature of the environment increases , the amount of entanglement monotonically decreases due to the thermal fluctuations .",
    "this is as expected .",
    "what is remarkable is that we find entanglement over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "as @xmath140 @xmath131k , @xmath141 , the entanglement vanishes , the movable mirrors become completely separable . so decreasing the temperature of the environment can make the entanglement between the movable mirrors stronger .",
    "note that substantial progress has been made in cooling the nanomechanical oscillators @xcite .",
    "further the ground state cooling using the resolved sideband regime might soon become feasible .",
    "clearly the entanglement depends on both the quality factor of the cavity and the temperature of the environment .",
    "the optical ring cavities are expected to yield much higher quality factor : @xmath142khz , see for example  @xcite , though for fixed mirrors replaced by moving mirrors , the quality factor may be deteriorated .",
    "metheods for detection of entanglement are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we note here that in our case we can deduce entanglement from the knowledge of @xmath122 .",
    "it can be shown from equation ( [ 11 ] ) that @xmath120 can be obtained from the measurement of the fluctuations in the quadrature of the output field .",
    "if we use a different geometry of the ring cavity , as shown in figure  [ fig5 ] , then we have the possibility of entangling other quadratures of the mirrors . in this case , the hamiltonian of the system in the frame rotating at the laser frequency becomes @xmath143 we note the interaction between the two movable mirrors and the cavity field depends only on the total displacement of the movable mirrors .",
    "the movable mirrors are said to be entangled if @xmath144 and @xmath145 satisfy the inequality @xcite @xmath146 where @xmath59 and @xmath147 .",
    "the @xmath148 is the relative displacement of the two movable mirrors , which is not related to the radiation pressure , only determined by the thermal noise .",
    "the @xmath149 is the total momentum of the two movable mirrors , and depends on the radiation pressure and the thermal noise .",
    "the relation between @xmath149 and @xmath150 is the same as the relation between @xmath118 and @xmath119 we defined above . since @xmath151=[q_{1}-q_{2},p_{1}+p_{2}]=0 $ ]",
    ", @xmath148 and @xmath149 can be simultaneously measured with infinite precision .",
    "thus @xmath148 and @xmath150 can also be simultaneously measured with infinite precision . through calculations",
    ", we find that @xmath152 and @xmath153 in a 4-mirror ring cavity have the same form as @xmath114 ( equation ( [ 23 ] ) ) and@xmath122 ( equation ( [ 21 ] ) ) in a 3-mirror ring cavity , respectively .",
    "if we choose the same parameters , the same numerical results will be obtained .",
    "therefore , using a 4-mirror ring cavity , the entanglement between two oscillators can also be obtained .",
    "in conclusion , we have found that the injection of squeezed vacuum light and a laser can entangle the two identical movable mirrors by the radiation pressure .",
    "the result shows the maximum entanglement of the movable mirrors happens if the squeezed vacuum light with @xmath51 about 1 is injected into the cavity .",
    "we also find significant entanglement over a very wide range of input laser power and temperatures of the environment .",
