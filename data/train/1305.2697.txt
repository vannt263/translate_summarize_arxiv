    "the bcs theory is first proposed as a microscopic theory for superconductivity @xcite .",

    "after fifty years , it is still the `` standard '' treatment ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , mainly because of its simplicity and the convenience in adding higher - order correlations ( for example by qrpa ) . however , there are two main disadvantages of the theory applied to the finite nucleus , as compared to macroscopic quantum systems .",
    "firstly , by introducing quasi - particles , it destroys particle number conservation . quite often , the fluctuation in particle number was not small relative to its average value .",
    "secondly , for the nuclear system with finite level spacing , the bcs theory requires a minimal pairing strength .",
    "below that strength it gives only trivial ( vanishing ) solutions , while in reality the pairing always has an effect .",
    "the current treatment by the generalized density matrix ( gdm ) method does not have the above two deficiencies .",
    "yet it is simple enough for further treatment of higher - order correlations within the same gdm framework .",

    "the gdm formalism was originally introduced in refs . @xcite and recently reconsidered in refs . @xcite . until now",
    "its treatment of nuclear pairing correlations is limited to the conventional bcs , thus has the above discussed disadvantages . here",
    "we explore the possibility of using the `` pair condensate '' ( [ gs ] ) ( with definite particle number ) as the `` variational '' ground state , instead of the bcs `` quasi - particle vacuum '' .",
    "below we set up the gdm formalism in a general way , but solve in this work only the lowest - order ( mean - field ) equations .",
    "we assume that the ground state of the @xmath0-particle system is a @xmath1-pair condensate , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a normalization factor that will be specified later [ see eq .",

    "the method assumes that the hamiltonian and the density matrix operators can be expanded as taylor series of the bosonic mode operators ( collective coordinate @xmath15 and momentum @xmath16 ) within the collective subspace , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ k_exp ] ) @xmath19 destroys two particles , hence it connects the collective subspace with @xmath0 particles to that with @xmath20 particles .",
    "the first term @xmath21 is the usual `` pair transition amplitude '' between the ground states of neighboring even - even nuclei .",
    "higher - order terms @xmath22 represent the transition amplitudes between the collectively excited states ( with phonons ) .",
    "strictly speaking , the generalized density matrices ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , the mode operators ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , and the bosonic hamiltonian parameters @xmath27 should have the label of particle number @xmath28 , and the gdm equations should be solved simultaneously for all the nuclei between two magic numbers , in a way similar to that in ref .",
