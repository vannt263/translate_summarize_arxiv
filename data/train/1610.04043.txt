    "random graphs and interacting particle systems have been two active fields of research in probability in the past decades . in 2003 ,",
    "foss and konstantopoulos  @xcite introduced a new interacting particle system called the infinite - bin model and established a correspondence between a certain class of infinite - bin models and barak - erds random graphs , which are a directed acyclic version of erds - rnyi graphs .    in this article , we study the speed at which the front of an infinite - bin model drifts to infinity .",
    "these results are applied to obtain a fine asymptotic of the length of the longest path in a barak - erds graph . in the remainder of the introduction ,",
    "we first describe barak - erds graphs , then infinite - bin models .",
    "we finally state our main results .",
    "barak and erds introduced in  @xcite the following model of a random directed graph with vertex set @xmath8 ( which we refer to as barak - erds graphs from now on ) : for each pair of vertices @xmath2 , add an edge directed from @xmath3 to @xmath4 with probability @xmath0 , independently for each pair .",
    "they were interested in the maximal size of strongly independent sets in such graphs .",
    "however , one of the most widely studied properties of barak - erds graphs has been the length of its longest path .",
    "it has applications to mathematical ecology ( food chains )  @xcite , performance evaluation of computer systems ( speed of parallel processes )  @xcite and queuing theory ( stability of queues )  @xcite .",
    "newman  @xcite studied the length of the longest path in barak - erds graphs in several settings , when the edge probability @xmath0 is constant ( dense case ) , but also when it is of the form @xmath9 with @xmath10 ( sparse case ) . in the dense case , he proved that when @xmath11 gets large , the length of the longest path @xmath12 grows linearly with @xmath11 in the first - order approximation : @xmath13 where the linear growth rate @xmath14 is a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig : cpgraph ] an approximation of @xmath5 .    , using @xmath15 iterations of the infinite - bin model , for values of @xmath0 that are integer multiples of @xmath16.,height=192 ]    newman proved that the function @xmath14 is continuous and computed its derivative at @xmath7 .",
    "foss and konstantopoulos  @xcite studied barak - erds graphs under the name of `` stochastic ordered graphs '' and provided upper and lower bounds for @xmath14 , obtaining in particular that @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the probability of the absence of an edge .",
    "denisov , foss and konstantopoulos  @xcite introduced the more general model of a directed slab graph and proved a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the length of its longest path .",
    "konstantopoulos and trinajsti  @xcite looked at a directed random graph with vertices in @xmath19 ( instead of @xmath20 for the infinite version of barak - erds graphs ) and identified fluctuations following the tracy - widom distribution .",
    "foss , martin and schmidt  @xcite added to the original barak - erds model random edge lengths , in which case the problem of the longest path can be reformulated as a last - passage percolation question .",
    "gelenbe , nelson , philips and tantawi  @xcite studied a similar problem , but with random weights on the vertices rather than on the edges .",
    "the question of the longest path in erds - rnyi graphs , which are the undirected version of barak - erds graphs , was studied in the sparse case by ajtai , komls and szemerdi  @xcite .",
    "foss and konstantopoulos introduced the infinite - bin model in  @xcite as an interacting particle system which , for a right choice of parameters , gives information about the growth rate @xmath5 of the longest path in barak - erds graphs .",
    "consider a set of bins indexed by the set of integers @xmath20 .",
    "each bin may contain any number of balls , finite or infinite .",
    "a configuration of balls in bins is called _ admissible _ if the following two conditions hold :    1 .",
    "there exists @xmath21 such that every bin indexed by @xmath22 is empty ; 2 .",
    "the total number of balls in the configuration is infinite .",
    "the largest integer @xmath23 indexing a nonempty bin is called the position of the _",
    "front_. from now on , all configurations will implicitly be assumed to be admissible .",
    "given an integer @xmath24 , we define the _ move of type @xmath25 _ as a map @xmath26 from the set of configurations to itself .",
    "given an initial configuration @xmath27 , @xmath28 is obtained by adding one ball to the bin of index @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the index of the bin containing the @xmath25-th ball of @xmath27 ( the balls are counted from right to left , starting from the rightmost nonempty bin ) .    given a probability distribution @xmath31 on the set of positive integers and an initial configuration @xmath32 , one defines the markovian evolution of the infinite - bin model with distribution @xmath31 ( or ibm(@xmath31 ) for short ) as the following stochastic recursive sequence : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an i.i.d .",
    "sequence distributed like @xmath31 .",
    "we prove in theorem  [ thm : existsspeed ] that the front moves to the right at a speed which tends a.s . to a constant limit  @xmath35 .",
    "we call @xmath35 the _ speed _ of the ibm(@xmath31 ) . note that the model defined in  @xcite was slightly more general , allowing @xmath34 to be a stationary - ergodic sequence",
    ". we also do not adopt their convention of shifting the indexing of the bins which forces the front to always be at position @xmath36 .",
    "foss and konstantopoulos  @xcite proved that if @xmath37 was the geometric distribution of parameter @xmath0 then @xmath38 , where @xmath5 is the growth rate of the length of the longest path in barak - erds graphs with edge probability @xmath0 .",
    "they also proved , for distributions @xmath31 with finite mean verifying @xmath39 , the existence of renovations events , which yields a functional law of large numbers and central limit theorem for the ibm(@xmath31 ) .",
    "based on a coupling result for the infinite - bin model obtained by chernysh and ramassamy  @xcite , foss and zachary  @xcite managed to remove the condition @xmath39 required by  @xcite to obtain renovation events .",
    "aldous and pitman  @xcite had already studied a special case of the infinite - bin model , namely what happens to the speed of the front when @xmath31 is the uniform distribution on @xmath8 , in the limit when @xmath11 goes to infinity .",
    "they were motivated by an application to the running time of local improvement algorithms defined by tovey  @xcite .",
    "we now state the main results proved in this paper .",
    "the first result is that in every infinite - bin model , the front moves at linear speed .",

    "secondly we provide the first two terms of the asymptotic expansion of @xmath5 as @xmath47 .",

    "we define the subset @xmath56 of @xmath49 as follows : a word @xmath53 belongs to @xmath56 if it is non - empty , and if starting from configuration @xmath27 and applying successively the moves @xmath57 , the last move @xmath58 results in placing a ball in a previously empty bin .    given a word @xmath50 which is not the empty word , we set @xmath59 to be the word obtained from @xmath53 by removing the first letter ( with the convention that @xmath60 ) .",
