    "a complete description of accelerating observers in flat spacetime is lacking in the literature .",
    "observers moving with constant proper acceleration ( rindler observers @xcite ) are the most widely used description of such behavior so far , especially in discussions of the thermal properties of vacuum states in quantum field theories @xcite . in this paper",
    "we derive the trajectory and the metric of an observer moving with non - constant proper acceleration in two - dimensional flat spacetime .",
    "it is clear that rindler observers are unphysical .",
    "they accelerate with constant proper acceleration for all time , reaching speeds arbitrarily close to the speed of light .",
    "for this reason , rindler observers see the light cone as an event horizon .",
    "these horizons partition the spacetime into four regions @xcite : the left and right rindler wedges , which we characterize by a metric @xmath1 , and the kasner - milne @xcite universe , which we characterize by a metric @xmath2 .",
    "these regions are bounded by the lines in flat spacetime at 45 degrees to the @xmath3- and @xmath4-axes ( in units of @xmath5 ) .",
    "observers in the rindler wedges are disconnected from some of the other wedges and thus do not have complete access to the full spacetime .",
    "for instance , an observer in the right rindler wedge can receive signals from the past of the kasner - milne universe ( lower wedge ) and send signals to the future kasner - milne universe ( upper wedge ) , but is completely disconnected from the left rindler wedge .",
    "this is because observers in the rindler wedges see event horizons corresponding to the light cone portions in their quadrants of the spacetime .",
    "minkowski ( inertial ) observers never experience this ; an event occuring in flat spacetime is always accessible to the minkowski observer provided the observer waits sufficiently long times .",
    "we begin with the flat spacetime metric @xmath6 and change coordinates to the accelerating frame .",
    "the most general coordinate transformation is @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "these coordinate transformations lead to the following metric : @xmath9    here primes indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath10 and dots indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "we attempt to eliminate the cross term @xmath12 .",
    "we choose @xmath13 and solve the partial differential equation .",
    "we assume a solution that is separable , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it follows that @xmath16 each side of the equation depends only on @xmath11 or @xmath10 and therefore must be equal to a constant . integrating both equations",
    ", we obtain relationships between the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 as well as @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21    the general solutions to the equations in ( [ ab ] ) come in four cases .",
    "we consider the trivial case first , @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 and forces @xmath25 .",
    "we take cases two and three to be @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and vice versa .",
    "first we take @xmath28 ; this reduces the equations in ( [ ab ] ) to @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the general solution to this equation is @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus , our coordinate transformations look like @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and we see that case two corresponds to the left and right rindler wedges . with coordinate choices @xmath35 and @xmath36 the metric becomes @xmath37    for case three , the condition @xmath38 and @xmath39 implies @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which describe the kasner - milne universe . the coordinate choices @xmath42 and @xmath43 now yield the metric @xmath44 observers in the kasner - milne wedges move with constant velocity ; the distance between two observers decreases in the lower wedge and increases in the upper wedge , leading some to refer to the upper and lower wedges as the expanding and contracting universe , respectively @xcite .",
    "the fourth  and most interesting  case is @xmath38 and @xmath45 .",
    "then , the solutions to equations ( [ ab ] ) with the condition that @xmath46 and @xmath47 are both non - zero become @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and also @xmath50 , @xmath51 . with the appropriate choice of @xmath52 and @xmath53 it follows that @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "the metric of the accelerating observer is therefore @xmath56    in figure 1 we show a spacetime diagram with lines of constant @xmath53 and constant @xmath52 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the accelerating observer sees no event horizons .",
    "the trajectories are hyperbolic but they are not bounded by the light cones .",
    "we select a fixed position @xmath57 in the instantaneous rest frame of the accelerating observer and calculate the velocity . @xmath58    the speed of the accelerating observer ranges from 0 to 1 , the speed of light , and we may adjust this speed by varying either the position of the accelerating observer in his coordinate system or the parameter @xmath59 .",
    "we define the terminal velocity @xmath60 for convenience and physical insight , and denote by @xmath61 the relativistic gamma factor associated with this terminal velocity , so that @xmath62 .",
    "we then calculate the acceleration @xmath63 . @xmath64",
    "the transformation law to obtain the proper acceleration is @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66^{-3/2}\\ ] ]    for completeness , we note from ( [ metric ] ) or from the equivalent form @xmath67 ( dt^2 - dx^2)\\ ] ] that the relationship between the time @xmath53 and the proper time @xmath68 of the observer at @xmath57 is @xmath69^{-1/2 } d \\tau\\ ] ] unlike in the rindler case , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are related here by a time - dependent factor .",
    "we have yet to identify the meaning of the parameter @xmath59 . to determine what @xmath59 is physically , we need to analyze the trajectory @xmath72 which we obtain from the original coordinate transformations ( [ traject ] ) . @xmath73^{1/2}\\ ] ] we also see from ( [ traject ] ) that @xmath74 , and this is the exact condition we need to determine @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath75 therefore , @xmath76 is determined by the distance of closest approach @xmath77 and the initial velocity @xmath78 .",
    "alternatively , we could also fix @xmath59 by specifying the acceleration at @xmath79 which leads to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",
    "in contrast to rindler , where observers require infinite accelerations @xcite , @xmath82 corresponds to stationary observers .",
    "we now return to our original kinematic equations and replace @xmath59 with physical parameters and restore minkowski time .",
    "this allows us to make comparisons with what we know about the equations of motion for a uniformly accelerating observer .",
    "the trajectory becomes @xmath83^{1/2}\\ ] ] for large @xmath4 , we see that ( [ x(t ) ] ) reduces to the equation of a line @xmath84 with slope @xmath78 .",
    "this explicitly shows that the hyperbolas cross over the 45-degree lines that define event horizons for uniformly accelerating observers .",
    "the same conclusion follows from the velocity @xmath85^{-1/2}\\ ] ] by considering again large @xmath4 behavior , where @xmath86 becomes @xmath78 .",
    "the acceleration is deceptively similar to that of a uniformly accelerating observer .",
    "@xmath87^{-3/2}\\ ] ] we recover the exact answer for the acceleration of a uniformly accelerating observer by taking the limit as @xmath88 with @xmath77 ( equivalently , @xmath89 ) fixed . the proper acceleration is @xmath90^{-3/2 }   = \\frac{v_\\infty}{\\alpha \\gamma_{\\infty } }   \\left [ 1 + \\left(\\frac{t}{\\alpha \\gamma_{\\infty}^2}\\right)^2 \\right]^{-3/2}\\ ] ] which clearly describes a non - uniformly accelerating observer .",
    "we see exactly what happens in the case of uniform acceleration in equation ( [ a_pr(t ) ] ) by taking the same limit @xmath88 with @xmath77 fixed .",
    "the proper acceleration reduces to the constant @xmath91 one would expect for a uniformly accelerating observer because the @xmath61 dividing the time coordinate becomes infinite as we take the limit .",
    "the transformation @xmath65 from acceleration to proper acceleration is equivalent to dividing the time coordinate @xmath4 by a single power of @xmath61 due to the fact that the gamma factor resulting from ( [ v(t ) ] ) is given by @xmath92^{1/2}\\ ] ] where we recover the exact @xmath93 factor for the uniformly accelerating observer in the limit @xmath88 as @xmath94^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath95 and @xmath96 the standard light cone coordinates in minkowski spacetime .",
    "we define @xmath97 and @xmath98 and use hyperbolic identities to obtain the following",
    ". @xmath99 these coordinates are completely invertible since the hyperbolic sine inverse is a well defined function on the entire domain .",
    "this isolates the coordinates , leaving @xmath100 as a function only of @xmath101 and @xmath86 as a function of only @xmath102 .",
    "note that @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and that both coordinate systems cover the entire spacetime . in light cone coordinates the metric becomes @xmath105    these results will be crucial in determining whether non - uniformly accelerating observers can associate thermal properties with the minkowski vacuum @xcite .",
    "we now have a metric that describes observers moving with non - constant proper acceleration .",
    "our solution reduces to the rindler case in the limit @xmath88 with @xmath77 fixed . for @xmath106 ,",
    "the proper acceleration vanishes as @xmath107 and is always below the rindler value @xmath91 for finite times .",
    "these observers asymptotically approach speeds less than the speed of light , characterized by @xmath78 , and therefore do not see event horizons .",
