    "<S> , this experiment has also raised many questions . </S>",
    "<S> most of these questions arise from a critical comparison between the experimental data @xcite and the original theoretical predictions @xcite , leading to the inevitable conclusion that there are some significant discrepancies between experiment and theory . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the key experimental observation is the development of a robust subgap zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) in the tunneling differential conductance of the nanowire in the presence of an external magnetic field applied along the wire , as predicted theoretically @xcite and as expected for a majorana zero energy mode in a topological superconductor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the actual magnitude of the zbcp ( @xmath0 ) is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the predicted ideal quantized value @xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> although recent theoretical works @xcite provide reasonable explanations for some of these discrepancies , other recent papers emphasize that a zbcp could arise in the system in the absence of majorana bound states , due to more mundane mechanisms involving strong disorder @xcite , smooth end confinement @xcite , or kondo physics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> given this fluid and confusing nature of the subject matter , with publications arguing in favor of or against the majorana interpretation of the experimental observation in ref . </S>",
    "<S> appearing almost weekly , it is of paramount importance to conceive of hallmark experimental signatures for the majorana quasiparticle . </S>",
    "<S> it was already emphasized in the original theoretical predictions @xcite that the observation of a zbcp at finite magnetic field is only a necessary condition for the existence of majorana quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> the sufficient condition to validate their existence must be some type of interference measurement , such as the fractional josephson effect @xcite manifesting a @xmath2 periodicity in an ac josephson measurement . </S>",
    "<S> while such a measurement , or the direct observation of non - abelian majorana interference @xcite , will certainly be necessary down the line to absolutely validate the existence of localized non - abelian majorana modes , the high level of complexity and difficulty of this type of measurements make it unlikely that they will be successful in the near future . </S>",

    "<S> both the effective sc coherence length and the effective fermi wavevector can be tuned by varying the external magnetic field or the chemical potential of the system , a direct observation of the oscillatory energy splitting with increasing magnetic field ( which increases the coherence length by increasing the effective fermi - velocity and suppressing the sc gap ) should be a definitive smoking gun for the majorana existence .    in real systems , there are two main challenges that have to be addressed : the finite energy resolution and the limited experimental ability to control the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> various broadening mechanisms ( e.g. , temperature , inelastic scattering , quasiparticle poisoning , disorder , finite tunnel barrier ) may mask the underlying majorana splitting oscillations as two closely  spaced split peaks near zero bias may merge into a single broad zero  bias peak . nonetheless , the width of the majorana peak should show a modulation with varying zeeman field or chemical potential , even if the finite resolution masks the splitting itself . in the current work </S>",
    "<S> we make detailed theoretical predictions about how the majorana zbcp splitting should depend on the relevant parameters . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions are experimentally verifiable and can serve as a clear smoking gun for the validation ( or invalidation ) of the observation of majorana modes in hybrid nanostructures . since four distinct experimental groups @xcite have already reported detailed results for the zbcp dependence on the applied zeeman field , it appears that our proposed majorana smoking gun measurement should be feasible in the very near future .    </S>",
    "<S> the currently existing experimental results do not manifest any clear signature of majorana oscillatory splitting , although the issue is by no means definitively sorted out since the higher field data are rather sparse and have not yet been carefully analyzed . </S>",

    "<S> dependent majorana splitting at constant chemical potential versus constant carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> all discussions of majorana splitting in the literature have so far considered only the constant chemical potential situation , where both the average splitting and the oscillation amplitude increase monotonically with increasing zeeman splitting , yet actual experiments , because of repulsive interactions are mostly carried out at constant density . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the constant density condition is qualitatively different and may lead to a strong suppression of the oscillatory splitting , although generically some splitting is always present . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the oscillatory splitting is always present at constant zeeman field as a function of chemical potential ( or particle density ) . </S>",

    "<S> our work clearly establishes that the majorana - induced zero bias conductance peak should manifest some oscillatory splitting at large applied magnetic fields ( or as a function of the gate - tuned chemical potential at constant magnetic field ) , and a direct observation of this oscillatory splitting behavior could be the smoking gun evidence for the majorana existence .    </S>",
