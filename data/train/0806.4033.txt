    "study of direct photon and dilepton spectra emanating from hot and dense matter formed in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions is a field of considerable current interest .",
    "electromagnetic probes have been proposed to be one of the most promising tools to characterize the initial state of the collisions  @xcite . because of the very nature of their interactions with the constituents of the system they tend to leave the system almost unscattered .",
    "in fact , photons ( dilepton as well ) can be used to determine the initial temperature , or equivalently the equilibration time .",
    "these are related to the final multiplicity of the produced hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( hic ) . by comparing the initial temperature with the transition temperature from lattice qcd",
    ", one can infer whether quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is formed or not .",
    "there are various sources of photons from relativistic heavy ion collisions : ( i ) direct photons are those which are produced in reactions of the type @xmath1 .",
    "one can subdivide this broad category of `` direct photons '' into `` prompt '' , `` pre - equilibrium '' , `` thermal '' ( from qgp as well as hadronic phase ) and finally the `` jet - photon '' also called `` jet conversion photon '' ( photons from jet - plasma interaction ) depending on their origin .",
    "( ii ) decay photons are basically the decay product of long lived secondaries ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 etc ) . the first calculation of thermal photons from quark matter ( qm ) has been done in ref .  @xcite using hard thermal loop ( htl ) .",
    "it is shown that at a fixed temperature the contribution from qm is similar to that produced from hot hadronic matter . here",
    ", our main concern is to calculate the jet - photons and compare them with the thermal photons from qm that has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the jet conversion mechanism  @xcite occurs when a high energy jet interacts with the medium constituents via annihilation and compton processes .",
    "it might be noted that this phenomenon ( for compton process ) has been illustrated quite some time ago  @xcite in the context of estimating photons from equilibrating plasma , where , it is assumed that because of the larger cross - section , gluons equilibrate faster providing a heat bath to the incoming quark - jet .",
    "a comparison of the photons , calculated in the above scenario , ( equivalent to photons from jet - plasma interaction ) with the direct photons ( thermal ) shows that the former remains dominant for photons with @xmath0 upto @xmath6 gev  @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that while evaluating jet - photon it is assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the largest contribution to photons corresponds to @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that the annihilating quark ( anti - quark ) directly converts into a photon .",
    "moreover , the quark jet might lose energy due to scattering with the constituents of the thermal bath before participating in compton and annihilation processes .",
    "we include this effect on the photon productions .",

    "however , its importance was demonstrated in the context of rhic in ref .",
    "the measurements of non - photonic single electron data  @xcite show larger suppression than expected .",
    "these electrons mainly come from heavy quark decay where the radiative energy loss is suppressed due to dead cone effect .",

    "collisional energy loss has been re - investigated in great detail  @xcite in recent times .",

    "this implies that the thermal distribution of the participating parton is evaluated at the photon momentum . in this work",
    "we relax this assumption and calculate the photon yield from jet - plasma interaction .",
    "we consider photon production in the @xmath0 range @xmath9gev .",
    "it is to be noted that to produce such photons the required energy of the participating jet does not exceed ( or remains below ) the critical energy @xmath10 ( @xmath11 )  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in this energy regime collisional loss seems to play important role  @xcite .",
    "it is shown in ref  @xcite that the quenching factor for high @xmath0 hadrons can be accommodated within the framework of collisional energy loss only .",
    "given the present scenario of energy loss mechanism in the context of rhic data we , in this work , investigate the role of collisional energy loss as calculated in refs .",
    "however , in order to see the effects of energy loss on jet - photon one should also incorporate the radiative energy loss and this has to be done in the same formalism in a realistic scenario . this has recently been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that the neutral pion @xmath0 spectra is sensitive to the inclusion of collisional and radiative energy loss .    in the photon production rate ( from jet - plasma interaction )",
    "one of the collision partners is assumed to be in equilibrium and the other ( the jet ) is executing random motion in the heat bath provided by quarks ( anti - quarks ) and gluons .",
    "furthermore , the interaction of the jet is dominated by small angle scattering . in such scenario the evolution of the jet phase space distribution",

    "we notice that the inclusion of the radiative energy loss will further reduce the yield at high @xmath0 . that is expected to give a better description of the phenix data in the high energy regime .",
