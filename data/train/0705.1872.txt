    "it is well known that there are two fundamental characteristics of high energy string scattering amplitudes , which make them very different from field theory scatterings .",
    "these are the softer exponential fall - off behavior ( in contrast to the power - law behavior of field theory scatterings ) and the existence of infinite regge - pole structure in the form factor of the high energy string scattering amplitudes .",
    "recently high - energy , fixed angle behavior of string scattering amplitudes @xcite was intensively reinvestigated for massive string states at arbitrary mass levels @xcite .",
    "an infinite number of linear relations , or stringy symmetries , among string scattering amplitudes of different string states were obtained .",
    "an important new ingredient of these calculations is the zero - norm states ( zns ) @xcite in the old covariant first quantized ( ocfq ) string spectrum .",
    "the existence of these infinite linear relations constitutes the _ third _ fundamental characteristics of high energy string scatterings , which is not shared by the usual point - particle field theory scatterings .",
    "these linear relations persist for string scattered from generic d@xmath2-brane @xcite except d - instanton and domain - wall . for the scattering of d - instanton",
    ", the form factor exhibits the well - known power - law behavior without regge - pole structure , and thus resembles a field theory amplitude . for the special case of domain - wall ( d24-brane ) scattering",
    ", it was discovered @xcite recently that , in contrast to the common wisdom of exponential fall off behavior @xcite , its form factor behaves as _ power - law _ with regge - pole structure .",
    "this discovery makes domain - wall scatterings a hybrid of string and field theory scatterings .",
    "moreover , it was shown @xcite that the linear relations break down for the domain - wall scattering due to this unusual power - law behavior .",
    "this result gives a strong evidence that the existence of the infinite linear relations , or stringy symmetries , of high - energy string scattering amplitudes is responsible for the softer ( exponential fall - off ) high - energy string scatterings than the ( power - law ) field theory scatterings .    to further convince ourselves with the coexistence of the infinite linear relations and the softer exponential fall - off behavior of string scatterings at high energies , it is important to find more examples of high energy string scatterings , which show the unusual power - law behavior and , simultaneously , give the breakdown of the infinite linear relations . with this in mind , in this paper",
    "we calculate high energy massive scattering amplitudes of closed bosonic string with some coordinates compactified on the torus @xcite . for each fixed mass level with given quantized and winding momenta @xmath0",
    ", we obtain infinite linear relations among high energy scattering amplitudes of different string states .",
    "this result is reminiscent of the existence of an infinite number of massive soliton zns in the compactified string constructed in @xcite .",
    "we then discover that , for some kinematic regime , so called mende regime ( mr ) , infinite linear relations with @xmath1 break down and , simultaneously , the amplitudes enhance to power - law behavior instead of the usual exponential fall - off behavior at high energies .",
    "it is the space - time t - duality symmetry that plays a role here .",
    "the power - law behavior of high energy string scatterings in a compact space was first suggested by mende @xcite .",
    "here we give an explicit calculation of the conjecture .",
    "moreover , in addition to the high energy string / domain - wall scatterings mentioned above @xcite , our result in this paper gives another evidence to support the coexistence of the infinite linear relations and the softer exponential fall - off behavior of high energy string scattering amplitudes as we pointed out previously @xcite .",
    "the result also suggests that the infinite linear relations are closely related to the full 26d space - time symmetry of closed bosonic string theory . this paper is organized as following . in section",
    "ii , we set up the kinematic for the compactified string and calculate the four - tachyon @xmath3 scattering amplitudes with arbitrary winding . in section iii , we derive the infinite linear relations among high energy scattering amplitudes of different string states with given @xmath0 for each fixed mass level .",
    "we then discuss the power - law behavior of the amplitudes and breakdown of the infinite linear relations in the mende regime .",
    "a brief conclusion is given in section iv .",

    "as we will see later , it is straightforward to generalize our calculation to more compactified coordinates .",

    "the momentum in the @xmath8 direction is then quantized to be@xmath9 where @xmath10 is an integer .",

    "we have also introduced the left and the right level masses as@xmath17 note that for the compactified closed string @xmath15 and @xmath16 are correlated through the winding modes .    in the center of momentum frame , the kinematic can be set up to be @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 and@xmath21",
    "with this setup , the center of mass energy @xmath22 is@xmath23 the conservation of momentum on the compactified direction gives@xmath24 and t - duality symmetry implies conservation of winding number@xmath25 one can easily calculate the following kinematic relations@xmath26@xmath27@xmath28 where the left and the right mandelstam variables are defined to be@xmath29 with@xmath30      we are now ready to calculate the string scattering amplitudes .",

    "one notes that all choices implies@xmath116 it is obvious that one can also compactify more than one coordinate to realize the mende condition .",
    "we conclude that the high energy scatterings of the `` highly winding string states '' of the compactified closed string in the mr behave as the unusual uv power - law , and the usual linear relations among scattering amplitudes break down due to the unusual power - law behavior .",

    "it is also reminiscent of our previous work on the power - law behavior of high energy string / domain - wall scatterings @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of string / domain - wall scatterings , the high energy scattering amplitudes behaves as power - law for the whole uv kinematic regime , and one can not see the transition from uv power - law behavior to the uv exponential fall - off behavior , neither can one see the transition from nonlinear relations to the linear relations among high energy scattering amplitudes of different string states . on the contrary , for the high energy scatterings of the compactified closed string considered in this paper",
    ", one gets more kinematic variables , namely @xmath117 to cover both gr and mr , so that one can see this interesting transition . through the observation of this transition ,",
    "one further confirms that the infinite linear relations obtained in @xcite are responsible for the uv softer string scattering amplitudes than the field theory scatterings .",
