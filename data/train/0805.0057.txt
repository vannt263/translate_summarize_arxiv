    "controlling the time evolution @xcite of a quantum system is a major task required for quantum information processing .",
    "several approaches to the control of a quantum system have been proposed in the past decade , which can be divided into coherent ( unitary ) and incoherent ( non - unitary ) control , according to how the controls enter the dynamics . in the coherent control scheme ,",
    "the controls enter the dynamics through the system hamiltonian .",
    "it affects the time evolution of the system state , but not its spectrum , i.e. , the eigenvalues of the target density matrix @xmath0 remain unchanged in the dynamics , due to the unitarity of the evolution . in the incoherent control scheme @xcite , an auxiliary system , called probe ,",
    "is introduced to manipulate the target system through their mutual interaction .",
    "this incoherent control scheme is of relevance whenever the system dynamics can not be directly accessed , and it provides a non - unitary evolution which is capable for transferring all initial states ( pure or mixed ) into an arbitrary pure or mixed state .",
    "this breaks the limitation for the coherent control mentioned above .    to be specific , romano and colleagues @xcite",
    "have investigated accessibility and controllability of a quantum bit ( or a two - level system ) coupled to a quantum probe , under the condition that the external control affects only the probe .",
    "this analysis is based on the cartan decomposition @xcite of the dynamics , and hence it is involved for high - dimensional systems . in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors propose a leaning control with a non - equilibrium environment .",
    "the results show that by tailoring the dissipative dynamics we can control the quantum system form a given state to a limited set of states ( reachable states ) .    in this paper , we first examine the controllability for two - dimensional systems ,",
    "then extend the approach to finite - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "this analysis is based on the quantum coherent control scheme and the hypothesis that the probe can be prepared in a specified initial state .",
    "the advantages of this scheme are threefold .",
    "firstly , it overcomes the difficulty of the cartan decomposition based analysis .",
    "secondly , it brings a connection between the coherent control and incoherent control for quantum systems , hence it is easy to be generalized to finite - dimensional systems .",
    "finally , this analysis provides a new control scheme , namely quantum states can be manipulated by probe state - dependent coherent control on the quantum system .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we describe the state of the controlled quantum system @xmath1 by a density matrix @xmath2 , a positive , unit trace operator on the hilbert space @xmath3 of the system .",
    "the convex set of all possible states is represented by @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "its boundary @xmath5 is a set of pure states satisfying @xmath6 by the definition @xcite , the system @xmath1 is controllable if and only if for all pairs @xmath7 , there exists a set of controls @xmath8 such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 for some @xmath11 suppose that the quantum system @xmath1 interacts with an initially unentangled probe @xmath12 , whose density matrix is denoted by @xmath13 on its hilbert space @xmath14 the time evolution of the composite system of the controlled system and the probe is governed by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the free hamiltonian for the controlled system and the probe , respectively , while @xmath18 denotes the coupling of the system and the probe .",
    "since local transformations do not affect the controllability of the system @xcite , @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be ignored safely in the later analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we study the controllability of a two - dimensional system in the indirect control scheme , then we extend the approach to arbitrary finite - dimensional systems in sec.iii .",
    "conclusions and discussions are presented in sec.iv .",
    "consider a two - dimensional system @xmath1 coupled to a probe @xmath12 modeled as another two - dimensional system .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian describing such a composite system takes the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 are coupling constants , @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the pauli matrices acting on hilbert space @xmath3 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we now show that the two - dimensional system is controllable governed by @xmath18 .",
    "the complete controllability requires that one can steer the system @xmath1 from _ arbitrary _ initial states to an arbitrary pure or mixed target state .",
    "this requirement on the initial states can be partly lifted by requiring that the interaction hamiltonian @xmath18 is unchanged up to @xmath8 under the local unitary transformation @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the identity operator on @xmath23 . by unchanged we mean @xmath28 , namely the transformation @xmath29 changes the coupling constants ( or the controls ) in the hamiltonian only .",
    "the proof is straightforward .",
    "suppose the composite system is initially prepared on a state @xmath30 .",
    "the final state of the quantum system @xmath1 reads ( @xmath31 ) @xmath32 where the trace is taken over the probe , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 represents a set of states which have the same spectrums as @xmath36 .",
    "since the two sets @xmath37 and @xmath38 are in one - to - one correspondence , thus the quantum system @xmath1 is controllable initially in @xmath39 if and only if it is controllable initially in @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "as by proper choice of the unitary transformation @xmath41 , the initial state can be always transformed to the form @xmath42 ( _ where @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the ground and excited states of the quantum system , respectively , and @xmath45 _ ) the system is completely controllable if we can steer the system to arbitrary target states from the initial state in the form ( [ 444 ] ) .",
    "we then show that the hamiltonian @xmath18 can drive the quantum system from the initial state @xmath46 to an arbitrary final state .",
    "the time evolution operator for the composite system governed by @xmath18 can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 satisfy @xmath51 with @xmath52 we assume that the probe is initially prepared on the state @xmath53 in terms of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 can be rewritten as , @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , as well as @xmath62 .",
    "we shall discuss how to prepare such a state for the probe at the end of this section .",
    "after some algebras , we obtain the density matrix for the quantum system at time @xmath63 @xmath64 define @xmath65 and @xmath66 are normalized and orthogonal . rewrite the density matrix for the quantum system in the basis spanned by @xmath67 where ( setting @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) @xmath70 here @xmath71 and @xmath72 is defined by , @xmath73 equivalently , @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes a function that extracts the angular component ( sometimes called the phase angle ) of a complex number .    for a given target state",
    ", we need to determine the control parameters @xmath8 and initial state parameter @xmath76 from @xmath71 and @xmath72 as well as the conditions that guarantee @xmath77 is an arbitrary pure state of the system .",
    "dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath71 and @xmath72 is so complicated that explicit expressions can not be found for general cases .",
    "we will present an example to show how to calculate this dependence at the end of this paragraph .",
    "two observations can be made from eq.([def ] ) .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath77 can be prepared for the quantum system to be an arbitrary pure state ( unnormalized ) , this can be done by control @xmath78 and @xmath79 in @xmath80 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath77 is a solution to the schrdinger equation @xmath81 with the initial state @xmath43 .",
    "since @xmath82 and @xmath83 are generators of the lie algebra @xmath84 , @xmath77 then can be manipulated to be any pure state in @xmath85 by varying @xmath78 and @xmath79 ; ( 2 ) @xmath71 ( or @xmath72 ) are controllable by @xmath86 and @xmath87 resulting in the change of the overlap between @xmath88 and @xmath89 as a result of these observations , we conclude that @xmath90 can be manipulated to be zero for any @xmath91 and @xmath92 leading to @xmath93 obviously , @xmath94 and @xmath95 can be arbitrarily controlled in the interval @xmath96 $ ] by changing @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the quantum system is controllable with @xmath18 . to be specific , from the condition @xmath97 we can easily find that @xmath98 suppose that the target state is @xmath99 , we find @xmath100 eqs.([spe2 ] ) and ( [ spe1 ] ) together determine the parameters @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath76 .    in comparison with earlier work @xcite , it seems that our proposal needs more real parameters to control a two - level system .",
    "this is not true .",
    "in fact , @xmath97 is not necessary to prove the controllability .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "diagonalizing the density matrix eq.([density1 ] ) , we can write the state of the quantum system as @xmath101 with the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors as follows @xmath102 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & |\\psi_+(t)\\rangle=\\cos\\frac{\\gamma}{2}|\\psi_{+0}\\rangle+ \\sin\\frac{\\gamma}{2}e^{i\\gamma}|\\psi_{+0}^{\\bot}\\rangle , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is orthogonal to @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and the mixing angle @xmath106 are defined by @xmath107^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "note that @xmath104 ( or @xmath103 ) can be controlled to be an arbitrary pure state regardless of @xmath106 and @xmath108 , since @xmath77 is controllable ( in the sense of pure states ) .",
    "hence , two real parameters in @xmath109 are enough to control @xmath104 .",
    "this together with the parameter to control @xmath110 ( from zero to @xmath111 ) @xcite , only three real parameters are required to control the two - level system .     is unchanged under @xmath29 , rather it is enough to control the system initially from a state on the green line in the middle of bloch ball .",
    "the actual control can be done by first rotating the initial state g determined by the target state to h , and then changing the purity of the state g to reach the target state i. ]    these discussions implies that a two - level system can be controlled by the hamiltonian eq.([eq1 ] ) together with the initial state preparation of the probe .",
    "the probe is not required to be prepared in an arbitrary initial state , rather it is a specified state determined according to the target state . in fact , this requirement on the probe can be removed by adding a control in the hamiltonian ( see eq.([spe1 ] ) ) .",
    "this holds true for arbitrary finite dimensional systems we will discuss in the next section .    before closing this section",
    ", we propose a possible way to prepare the probe on the required mixed state , @xmath112 . for this purpose",
    ", we place the probe in a thermal environment at temperature @xmath113 . at equilibrium",
    ", the density matrix of the probe would take the above form with @xmath114 , where @xmath115 , and @xmath116(@xmath117 ) is the energy corresponding to state @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) . by varying the energy spacing @xmath120",
    ", we can in principle obtain the required @xmath76 .",
    "note that @xmath76 is not required to vary between 0 and 1 @xcite , we conclude that the mixed state prepared in this way meets requirement in this proposal .",
    "in order to extend the approach to finite - dimensional systems , we recall that the controllability in this case can be expressed in the following way . for any state @xmath2 in @xmath4 ,",
    "the quantum system is controllable if and only if there exists a kraus map @xmath121 such that @xmath122 for all state @xmath2 in @xmath123 in this section , we shall show that the following hamiltonian @xmath124 which describes interaction between the system @xmath1 and the probe @xmath12 , would give rise to the kraus map @xmath121 required for the controllability . here",
    "the probe @xmath12 is modeled as a finite dimensional system with the same dimension as the system .",
    "assume that the composite system is initially on an uncorrelated state @xmath30 , and the target state of the quantum system reads @xmath125,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 denotes the time evolution operator of the whole system .",
    "preparing initially the probe on state ( @xmath127 ) @xmath128 we obtain @xmath129 here , @xmath130 is an eigenstate of @xmath131 , i.e. , @xmath132 .",
    "it is easy to find that @xmath133 satisfies @xmath134 the above results can be readily derived by writing @xmath135 and @xmath136 with these results , the kraus map @xmath121 is @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",
    "it has been proved that @xmath139 can drive all initial pure states of the quantum system @xmath1 into an arbitrary pure state at some time @xmath140 @xcite .",
    "so @xmath139 can be written as @xmath141 where both @xmath142 and @xmath143 are arbitrary and in @xmath85 .",
    "this together with the hypothesis that the probe can be initially prepared in an arbitrary state , show controllability of the quantum system @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to the earlier study @xcite , in which the authors presented a constructive proof of complete kinematic state controllability for finite - dimensional open systems via the kraus map , we here not only provide the details to realize such a kraus map but also derive the equations for parameters to control the system from an arbitrary initial state to an arbitrary target state .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the realization of the kraus map is not a trivial task , many works in literature are devoted to this task , in particular not all kraus maps allowed in quantum mechanics can be used to control a quantum system . this problem was shown in ref.@xcite and has been realized in ref.@xcite .",
    "now we present a general formulism to show that the indirect control can be represented as a combination of coherent control for the quantum system @xmath1 and preparation of the initial state of the probe @xmath12 .",
    "consider an initial state of the composite system @xmath30 , and a hamiltonian @xmath144 that governs the evolution of the composite system .",
    "suppose that both the quantum system and the probe are @xmath145-dimensional , and the quantum system is coherently controllable driven by @xmath16 .",
    "the latter assumption means @xmath16 can drive the quantum system from an arbitrary pure state to any other pure state , i.e. , @xmath146 spans a basis for the quantum system , and @xmath147 is an arbitrary pure state in @xmath85 for any @xmath148 . the density matrix for the quantum system at time @xmath63 reads @xmath149",
    "choosing @xmath150 , we obtain @xmath151 where we have set the initial state of the system as @xmath152 , and used the relation @xmath153 .",
    "suppose the target state is ( @xmath154 ) @xmath155 we find the condition to determine the controls in @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath156 where @xmath157 is defined by @xmath158 these results suggest that the manipulation of a quantum system may be realized by coherent controls for the quantum system conditioned on the spectrum of the initial density matrix of the probe .",
    "in this paper we have presented a scheme for indirect control of a quantum system coupled to a probe .",
    "this control scheme is actually a combination of coherent control conditioned on the initial state of the probe .",
    "for a two - level system , we have proved that the restriction on the initial state for the quantum system can be partly removed .",
    "this simplifies the formulation for the controllability .",
