    "[ intro ] most of the many studied ratchet mechanisms are discussed in the context of directed transport and filtering of discrete objects as , e.g. , colloids or macromolecules @xcite .",
    "examples include colloidal particles , that move in a directed manner through an array of periodic asymmetric micropores when under the influence of an oscillating external pressure @xcite .",
    "such particles may as well be driven by a dielectric potential of sawtooth shape that is switched on and off periodically @xcite . in many of those discrete ratchets the carrier fluid ( or solvent ) does not or nearly not move on average , i.e. , they can not be employed to transport a continuous phase .",
    "one exception is the motion of magnetic particles in ferrofluids under the influence of an oscillating magnetic field @xcite .",
    "there the resulting net motion of the particles is transmitted to the carrier liquid by a strong viscous coupling .",
    "however , the basic concept of ratchet transport  that a locally asymmetric but globally homogeneous system may induce global transport if it is kept out of equilibrium @xcite  applies equally well to pure continuous media .",
    "this has been employed recently to transport a liquid or a solid phase in settings that do not show any macroscopic gradient @xcite .",
    "the local asymmetry can result , for instance , from a periodic but asymmetric external potential .",
    "the periodic asymmetric variation needs to be on a small length scale compared to the system size .    in a first example , drops that are either placed on an asymmetrically structured substrate or between two such substrates move on average if a transverse electric field is applied periodically @xcite . a similar transport may be achieved by vibrating the structured substrate in a tangential direction @xcite .",
    "a second example is the triggering of a large scale mean flow in marangoni - bnard convection over a solid substrate with asymmetric grooves @xcite .",
    "that is an interesting example ( that has not yet been studied in detail theoretically ) as the static ratchet profile of the substrate interacts with the time - periodic motion of the convection rolls to produce the mean flow , i.e. , the time - periodic switching is done by the system itself . the strength and direction of the mean flow depend on the thickness of the liquid layer and the applied temperature gradient across the layer .",
    "a third example are leidenfrost drops that are placed on a hot surface with a ratchet - like topography .",
    "this induces a directed motion of the drops @xcite .",
    "the effect is not only observed for many liquids but as well for small blocks of dry ice @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of particle ratchets , not many models exist for the ratchet - driven transport of a continuous phase .",
    "reference @xcite considers a channel flow that is induced by locally asymmetric periodic arrays of electrodes under an ac voltage @xcite , and proposes an electro - osmotic model .",
    "a different concept was analysed in relation to the first experimental example : a two - layer film confined between two parallel plates can be driven by periodically switching on and off an external potential that is of ratchet shape in space . in the case",
    "that the potential is an electrical one and the two plates form a ( heterogeneous ) capacitor one may call the setup a flashing (electro-)wettability ratchet @xcite .",
    "the concept of wettability may be understood in a rather general way as it may include any effective interactions between the liquid - liquid free interface and the solid walls as long as one is able to apply them in a time - periodic , spatially periodic ( but locally asymmetric ) manner .",
    "net transport of a continuous phase may not only be caused by an external ratchet potential , but as well by a self - ratcheting effect : an enlightening example are drops that are driven up an incline by harmonic substrate vibrations at a finite angle to the substrate normal @xcite .",
    "a simple ratchet - like mechanism has been proposed : the vibration component that is orthogonal to the substrate strongly modulates the hydrostatic pressure and thereby induces a nonlinear response in the drop shape . that in turn determines the strongly nonlinear drop mobility . as a result",
    "the drop reacts in an asymmetric manner to the vibration component parallel to the substrate .",
    "this symmetry breaking between back and forth motion leads to the observed net motion of the drop .",
    "a second experiment does not employ an oblique vibration but decouples the normal and parallel vibrations entirely @xcite . on a horizontal substrate",
    "a net transport may be induced in either direction depending on the phase - shift and amplitude ratio of the two harmonic vibrations .",
    "note , that in ref .",
    "@xcite both vibrations have the same frequency . in both vibration experiments the phenomenon might be seen as a rocked self - ratcheting @xcite of the drop as it is the drop itself that introduces the local time - reflection asymmetry in the response to the time - periodic driving of the sliding motion .    the decisive element in both presented systems ",
    "the ratchet capacitor and the vibrated drop  is the interaction of the external periodic forces with capillarity and wettability . with other words the nonlinearity that is necessary for a net motion results from interface effects .",
    "one may call this class of ratchets , `` interfacial flow driven ratchets '' . as they are dominated by interface effects they become more effective the smaller the involved scales are .",
    "this implies that they are good candidates for micro- or even nano - fluidic actuators .    in the present contribution we will restrict our attention to one - layer films ( i.e. liquid under gas ) and formulate the thin film model that applies to both driving types  an external ratchet potential and the vibration ( section  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "then we present selected results for the external electrical ratchet potential in section  [ sec : ratchet ] .",
    "section  [ sec : vibr : one ] discusses drop transport by an oblique vibration of the substrate ( cf .  @xcite ) , whereas section  [ sec : vibr : two ] describes results for the recently investigated case where the drop moves as a reaction to a phase shift between decoupled horizontal and vertical vibrations @xcite .",

    "[ fig : ratsche](d ) and  [ fig : ratsche](e ) , respectively ) the film dewets the substrate and decays into a set of drops ( we call this the on - phase ) .",

    "[ fig : vel - on - phaseshift2 ] . in accordance with results in case ( ii ) one finds that the velocities become monotonically smaller ( for all phase shifts ) with increasing frequencies ( decreasing periods ) as the drops are less able to follow the substrate vibrations . the phase shift where the maximal mean",

    "are found at @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively .    a comparison with the experiments in ref .",
    "@xcite ( in particular their fig .",
    "3 ) shows that there the phase shift value where the maximal mean velocity is found and the value of the maximal mean velocity both increase with increasing ratio of the amplitudes of parallel and normal vibration .",
    "however , as further explained in the conclusion , a direct quantitative comparison is not possible .",
    "the experimental results show roughly the symmetry @xmath145 .",
    "small deviations are explained by the presence of defects on the substrate @xcite ( see , in particular , the inset of their fig .  2 ) . a striking difference between the results presented here and fig .",
    "3(a ) of @xcite is that in the latter the mean velocity depends in a strongly non - harmonic way on the phase shift . in the simulations we have not seen the experimentally found double peak structure around the maximal velocity .",
    "this point needs further investigation .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we have explored the usage of ratchet mechanisms to transport a continuous phase in micro - fluidic settings involving a free liquid - gas interface and contact lines , i.e. , under the influence of capillarity and wettability . in particular , we have studied on the one hand the transport of a dielectric liquid in a capacitor with an asymmetrically spatially modulated electrical field that is periodically switched on and off . in this case the ratchet - like potential is imposed externally . on the other hand",
    "we have investigated drops on a solid substrate that show net motion under the influence of different types of harmonic substrate vibrations . analysing the underlying mechanism we have found that the component of the harmonic vibration that is orthogonal to the substrate induces a nonlinear ( anharmonic ) response in the drop shape .",
    "the latter determines the strongly nonlinear drop mobility what results in an asymmetric response of the drop to the vibration component that is parallel to the substrate . the induced symmetry breaking between forward and backward motion during the different phases of the vibration results in the observed net motion of the drop .",
    "we have argued that the phenomenon might be seen as a rocked self - ratcheting as the drop itself introduces the local time - reflection asymmetry in the response to the time - periodic driving of the sliding motion .",
    "we employ the term `` rocked '' as the net motion is strongest in the low frequency limit as is typical for rocked particle ratchets @xcite .",
    "note as well that in the context of a drop on an incline the component of the vibration parallel to the substrate can be seen as a periodic rocking of the substrate .    for the vibrated drops",
    "our focus has been on two experimentally realised cases @xcite : an oblique substrate vibration and decoupled normal and parallel substrate vibrations of identical frequency but different amplitudes and/or phase shifts .",
    "as in the latter case the use of different amplitudes without phase shift corresponds to the case of the oblique vibration we have mainly analysed the dependence of the drop motion on phase shift .",
    "the decisive element in both presented systems ",
    "the ratchet capacitor and the self - ratcheting vibrated drop  is the interaction of the external periodic forces with capillarity and wettability , i.e. , the nonlinearity that is necessary for a net motion results from interface effects .",
    "one may call this class of ratchets , `` interfacial flow driven ratchets '' . as they are dominated by interface effects they are very effective on small scales .",
    "this implies that they are good candidates for micro- or even nano - fluidic actuators .",
    "one needs to keep in mind that all models analysed in the present contribution are obtained employing a long - wave or lubrication approximation @xcite .",
    "that means they are relatively simple , but fully dynamical , highly nonlinear models based on a minimal set of ingredients , i.e. , stokes flow in the lubrication approximation , ( electro-)capillarity , and wettability .",
    "they allow to study the net transport in the ratchet capacitor and the net motion of the vibrated droplet over a wide range of parameters , to understand the underlying mechanisms and to discuss transitions in the qualitative system behaviour",
    ".    however , when comparing such lubrication models with particular experiments one always has to keep in mind that the formal range of applicability of the lubrication approximation is limited and does often not overlap with the parameter ranges where experiments work best .",
    "the latter are often performed with liquid - substrate combinations that lead to equilibrium ( and dynamic ) contact angles that are not small . in our case ( ii )",
    "one uses as well large substrate inclinations and large angles between vibration direction and substrate normal . for a direct quantitative comparison _",
    "all _ those angles have to be small .",
    "nevertheless , lubrication models are extremely successful in explaining intriguing effects observed in a wide range of experiments involving capillarity and wettability .",
    "a good example for this are studies of morphological changes in sliding drops where some experiments are done for liquids with static contact angles above @xmath146 using substrate inclinations varying from zero to @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "lubrication theory well explains the effects ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the discussion in @xcite ) .    for the vibrated drop in ref .",
    "@xcite a liquid is used that has an equilibrium contact angle of about @xmath128 , the substrate inclination is @xmath146 , and the vibration is applied at an angle of @xmath146 with the substrate normal , i.e. , the experiment is well outside the formal range of applicability of the lubrication approximation .",
    "therefore , a direct quantitative comparison of mean velocities could only be done through some up - scaling procedure that lifts drop volume , contact angles and vibration angle from the lubrication theory values to the experimental ones .",
    "this might be done ( and is sometimes done ) .",
    "however , in our opinion the process has arbitrary elements , and we prefer not to employ it .",
    "the theory may , however , be related to the experiment in a semi - quantitative way by comparing , for instance , mean velocity in terms of drop size or typical timescales . in ref .",
    "@xcite the employed frequencies @xmath148 range from 25hz to 120hz . at an acceleration of 15@xmath55 and",
    "@xmath149hz one finds mean velocities of about 1mm / s , i.e. , the drop moves less than 20@xmath150 m per cycle . for a drop of 3 mm length",
    "this implies that it needs about 150 cycles to move by its own length .",
    "the situation is very similar in ref .",
    "@xcite where for the parameters depicted in their figs .  1 and 2 it takes about 50 vibration cycles to move the drop by its own length .",
    "note , that their fig .",
    "1 does not show snapshots taken during a single cycle , but selected pictures from 70 cycles .    in terms of the number of cycles needed to move the drop by its own length",
    "our results are very close to the experimental findings : at a period of @xmath151 we have a scaled velocity of about @xmath152 ( our fig .  [",
    "fig : vt](a ) ) ; for @xmath97 and @xmath153 this gives @xmath154 and an advancement per cycle of @xmath155 . for a drop like the one in our fig .",
    "[ fig : evol1 ] this implies that it takes about 190 cycles to move it by its own length .",
    "employing instead the accelerations of 15@xmath55 as in @xcite it takes about 90 cycles .",
    "this is a fair agreement between experiment and lubrication theory .",
    "one may as well discuss the time scale @xmath98 employed in the non - dimensionalisation and use it to compare the relevant vibration frequencies in the model and in the experiment .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss the relation of the discussed ratchet mechanisms to transport a continuous phase to particle ratchets. we do this by pointing out some formal analogies between the employed thin film equation and a fokker - planck equation for transport of discrete objects in a particle ratchet .",
    "the film thickness evolution equation @xmath8 + q(h ) f(t)\\right\\}. { \\label{eq : film2}}\\ ] ] shows similarities to a fokker - planck equation for interacting particles in an external ratchet potential @xcite .",
    "its non - dimensional form is @xmath156 with @xmath157 in the particular case , it is an evolution equation for the one - particle distribution function @xmath158 , where @xmath1 is a flashing ratchet potential ( note that the one used in @xcite is static ) rocked periodically by @xmath159 .",
    "the function @xmath160 stands for a periodic modulation of the non - dimensional temperature , and @xmath161 is a non - dimensional interaction parameter .",
    "one notes that both , the first order drift or transport term and the second order diffusion term are modulated in time .",
    "note that @xmath1 could as well be incorporated into the drift term instead of the diffusion term .",
    "however , differing from @xcite our cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) do not incorporate an external potential .",
    "the absence of a spatial ratchet potential is compensated by strongly nonlinear prefactors of the diffusion and the drift term that result in mean flow even for harmonic ( i.e. , time - symmetric driving ) . in the context of particle ratchets related systems",
    "are studied @xcite where a mean flux is created without spatial ratchet potential but through the response of two different ( weakly ) coupled degrees of freedom to time - periodic driving .",
    "the degrees of freedom are related to two different interacting particle species in @xcite , and to pancake vortices and josephson vortices in layered superconductors in @xcite . however , in contrast to our case in @xcite the driving is time - asymmetric .",
    "time - symmetric driving can as well induce mean transport in a particle ratchet without spatially varying potential if the coupling of the different degrees of freedom is sufficiently nonlinear .",
    "the only example we are aware of is the `` vortex diode '' discussed in @xcite .",
    "note finally , that similar 4th order terms as the capillarity term in eq .",
