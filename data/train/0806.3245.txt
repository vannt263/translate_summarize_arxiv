    "@xmath7 levine achieved this remarkable result by considering a natural homomorphism @xmath8 from the algebraic concordance group @xmath9 into the concordance group of isometric structures @xmath10 on finite dimensional vector spaces over @xmath11 ( we describe @xmath10 in detail in section [ isostr ] below ) .",

    "we focus exclusively on the case of @xmath16 .    to determine the values of levine s complete set of invariants for a given knot @xmath17 , one is required to find the irreducible symmetric factors of the alexander polynomial @xmath18 of @xmath17 . as the question of whether or not a given polynomial is irreducible is a difficult one in general , the task of determining all the irreducible factors of a given symmetric polynomial can be quite intractable , more so as the degree of the polynomial grows .",

    "<S> in his two pioneering articles @xcite jerry levine introduced and completely determined the algebraic concordance groups of odd dimensional knots . </S>",
    "<S> he did so by defining a host of invariants of algebraic concordance which he showed were a complete set of invariants . while being very powerful , these invariants are in practice often hard to determine , especially for knots with alexander polynomials of high degree . </S>",
    "<S> we thus propose the study of a weaker set of invariants of algebraic concordance  the rational witt classes of knots . </S>",
    "<S> though these are rather weaker invariants than those defined by levine , they have the advantage of lending themselves to quite manageable computability . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this point by computing the rational witt classes of all pretzel knots . </S>",
    "<S> we give many examples and provide applications to obstructing sliceness for pretzel knots . </S>",
    "<S> also , we obtain explicit formulae for the determinants and signatures of all pretzel knots .    </S>",
