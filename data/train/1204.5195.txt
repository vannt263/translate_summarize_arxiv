    "understanding the formation of normal disc galaxies remains one of the key challenges in astrophysics today .",
    "a general physical picture has been in place for some time ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but attempts to form realistic disc galaxies , and to test the general framework in detail , using ab initio cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , have had only limited success thus far . specifically , the simulations have historically yielded galaxies with too large of a fraction of their baryons locked up in stars ( the `` overcooling problem '' , e.g. , @xcite ) , sizes that are too small ( the `` angular momentum problem '' , e.g. , @xcite ) , and rotation curves that decline with radius ( rather than being approximately flat as observed ) due to the presence of an excessively large spheroidal component ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is plausible that all three of these problems are related .",
    "it has become increasingly clear from many different lines of evidence that feedback plays a very important role in regulating the star formation ( sf ) of galaxies and also in setting their internal structure .",
    "modelling feedback from supernovae ( sne ) in simulations of galaxy formation is challenging , as the injected thermal energy tends to be radiated away before it can have any hydrodynamical effect ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that simulations still do not have sufficient resolution ( nor all the physics necessary ) to model the interstellar medium correctly .",
    "cosmological simulations must therefore resort to subgrid recipes to try to overcome the overcooling problem ( see the discussions in @xcite ) , which is plausibly the fundamental underlying cause of the other problems mentioned above ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "typically , the sn energy is injected kinetically rather than thermally ( e.g. , @xcite ) and/or radiative cooling is suppressed by hand for a short time in the immediate aftermath of energy injection ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although other solutions exist ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the past few years",
    "there has been a good deal of progress on the formation of more realistic discs galaxies in cosmological simulations .",
    "a number of groups have been carrying out very high resolution `` zoomed '' simulations of individual systems primarily using a thermal sn feedback subgrid prescription ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite for zoomed simulations with a kinetic feedback model )",
    ". generally speaking , these studies have found that higher numerical resolution , together with increased density thresholds for sf , result in much more efficient feedback which , in turn , allows the simulations to reproduce many of the properties of normal disc galaxies , including reasonable sf efficiencies , disc sizes , and approximately flat rotation curves . along with these successes , however , there remain important shortcomings , such as the apparent inability of current simulations ( and semi - analytic models ) to match the observed specific star formation rates of disc galaxies both locally and at high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while the ability of recent high resolution simulatons to reproduce a number of important observables is certainly encouraging , caution is warranted in applying the understanding derived from them to the galaxy population in general .",
    "firstly , the feedback implemented in many of these studies has been tuned to produce ` realistic ' disc galaxies .",
    "however , given the uncertain ( and possibly degenerate ) nature of subgrid processes , it is dangerous to claim success on the basis of a handful of simulated galaxies .",
    "the degree of realism should be judged on the basis of examining many different observables over a wide range of mass and redshift .",
    "secondly , the systems that are chosen to be re - simulated at very high resolution have typically , although not always , been selected on the basis of their merger history - the common lore being that quiescent merger histories give rise to disc galaxies .",
    "however , the link between merger history and galaxy morphology is complicated ( e.g. , @xcite ) and , in any case , the fact that the majority of isolated normal galaxies in the local universe are spirals implies that no such selection based on merger history should be necessary .    an alternative approach , therefore , is to try to simulate large , _ representative _ populations of galaxies without tuning the feedback or explicitly selecting particular merger histories in order to produce ` realistic ' disc galaxies at the present day .",
    "the downside of this approach is that the resolution must be reduced , and so too are the kinds of questions one can ask of the simulations . also , there is obviously no guarantee that reasonable disc ( or elliptical ) galaxies will be produced in the simulation , as there has been no explicit tuning to get the ` right ' answer . at present , it is computationally feasible to simulate large populations ( @xmath4 ) of normal galaxies with @xmath5 kpc scale resolution .",
    "this is the approach we adopt in the present study .",
    "in particular , we use the galaxies - intergalactic medium interaction calculation ( gimic ) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations , which were carried out by the virgo consortium and are described in detail by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the suite consists of a number of large , nearly spherical regions ( @xmath6 mpc in radius ) extracted from the millennium simulation and re - simulated at higher resolution with gas dynamics , including subgrid prescriptions for metal - dependent radiative cooling , sf , chemodynamics , and a kinetic implementation of sn feedback .",
    "the resolution of gimic  is somewhat lower than in the studies noted above that have looked at the formation of individual disc galaxies .",
    "our work is therefore complementary to these very high - resolution studies in that , instead of aiming for maximum resolution on a single system ( or a handful of systems ) , we elect to run lower resolution simulations of a large _ population _ of galaxies , so that we may compare our results to large observational samples of galaxies and place them in a wider context .",
    "we note that a number of recent zoom simulation - based studies have implied that very high resolution is _ required _ in order to form reasonable disc galaxies at all , but the accuracy of this statement depends crucially on the nature of the implementation of important subgrid physics ( particularly sn feedback ) in the simulations . as we have shown elsewhere",
    "( @xcite ) , the gimic  simulations have no difficulty in forming disc - dominated ( or even bulgeless ) galaxies even though they do not have extremely high resolution ( in any case , we show in the appendix that our results are robust to changes in the resolution ) .    in the present study",
    ", we examine the relation between stellar mass and rotation velocity of disc galaxies ( i.e. , the ` tully - fisher ' relation ) , rotation curves in bins of stellar mass of the disc galaxies , the relation between stellar mass and size of disc galaxies , the sf efficiency of both disc and elliptical galaxies , the relation between stellar mass and optical rotation to virial circular velocity ratio ( @xmath1 ) , and the relation between stellar mass and specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) .",
    "we compare the simulations to a variety of recent local observations over a wide galaxy stellar mass range of @xmath7 \\le 11.5 $ ] . throughout",
    "we adjust the observational stellar mass measurements so that they are appropriate for a @xcite stellar initial mass function ( imf ) ( e.g. , we add 0.05 dex [ subtract 0.1 dex ] in the case a kroupa [ ` diet salpeter ' ] imf ) , which is what is adopted in the gimic  simulations . for stellar masses derived using the @xmath8-colour scalings of @xcite or @xcite , we also apply a small adjustment to the mass using the expression given in the appendix of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) so that the stellar masses are consistent with those derived from more accurate ` sed fitting ' of five - band sdss data @xcite .",
    "the present study is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we present a description of the gimic  simulations . in section 3",
    "we present our main results on the tully - fisher relation , rotation curves , mass - size relation , and sf efficiencies . in section 4",
    "we present some scaling arguments that link the faint - end slope of the galaxy stellar mass function to the slope of the tully - fisher relation .",
    "we summarize and discuss our findings in section 5 .",
    "a detailed description of the gimic  simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "we therefore present only a brief summary here .",
    "the suite consists of a set of hydrodynamical re - simulations of five nearly spherical regions ( @xmath9 mpc in radius ) extracted from the ( dark matter ) millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "the regions were selected to have overdensities at @xmath10 that represent @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the root - mean - square deviation from the mean on this spatial scale .",
    "the 5 spheres are therefore diverse in terms of the large - scale structure that is present within them . for the purposes of the present study we select ` central ' galaxies only , which are defined as the most massive self - gravitating collection of stars , gas and dark matter ( i.e. , the most massive subhalo ) in a friends - of - friends group .",
    "systems and their substructures are identified in the simulations using the subfind  algorithm of @xcite , that extends the standard implementation of @xcite by including baryonic particles in the identification of self - bound substructures .",
    "the cosmological parameters adopted for gimic  are the same as those assumed in the millennium simulation and correspond to a @xmath13cdm model with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the rms amplitude of linearly evolved mass fluctuations on a scale of @xmath19 mpc at @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum ) .",
    "the value of @xmath26 is approximately 2-sigma higher than has been inferred from the most recent cmb data @xcite , which will affect the abundance of the simulated galaxies somewhat , but should not significantly affect their internal properties .",
    "the simulations were evolved from @xmath27 to @xmath20 using the treepm - sph code gadget-3  ( last described in @xcite ) , which has been modified to incorporate new baryonic physics .",
    "radiative cooling rates for the gas are computed on an element - by - element basis using pre - computed tables generated with cloudy @xcite that contain cooling rates as a function of density , temperature , and redshift and that account for the presence of the cosmic microwave background and photoionisation from a @xcite ionising uv / x - ray background ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this background is switched on at @xmath28 in the simulation , where it ` reionises ' the simulation volume .",
    "star formation is tracked in the simulations following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "gas with densities exceeding the critical density for the onset of the thermo - gravitational instability is expected to be multiphase and to form stars ( @xmath29 @xmath30 ; @xcite ) . because the simulations lack the physics to model the cold interstellar gas phase , an effective equation of state ( eos ) is imposed with pressure @xmath31 for densities k when they cross the density threshold and if their density exceeds 57.7 times the cosmic mean .",
    "these criteria prevent sf in intracluster gas and in intergalactic gas at very high redshift , respectively @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 @xmath30 .",
    "as described in @xcite , gas on the effective eos is allowed to form stars at a pressure - dependent rate that reproduces the observed kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite by construction .",
    "note that the resolution of the gimic  simulations ( see below ) was actually chosen so as to marginally resolve the jeans mass at the adopted density threshold for sf .",
    "higher resolution is necessary to be able to increase the sf threshold , but it is not sufficient by itself since additional physics is required to accurately capture the phase transition to the cold ism ( certainly radiative transfer but possibly also dust , conduction , cosmic rays , and magnetic fields ) .",
    "the recent very high resolution zoomed simulations discussed in section 1 , which have pushed to higher sf thresholds , have not included this additional physics .",
    "the timed release of individual elements by both massive ( type ii sne and stellar winds ) and intermediate mass stars ( type ia sne and asymptotic giant branch stars ) is included following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "a set of 11 individual elements are followed in these simulations ( h , he , c , ca , n , o , ne , mg , s , si , fe ) , which represent all the important species for computing radiative cooling rates , in the presence of a uv / x - ray background .    feedback from sne is incorporated using the kinetic wind model of @xcite with the initial wind velocity , @xmath34 , set to @xmath35 km / s and the mass - loading parameter ( i.e. , the ratio of the mass of gas given a velocity kick to that turned into newly formed star particles ) , @xmath36 , set to @xmath37 .",
    "this corresponds to using approximately 80% of the total energy available from sne for a chabrier imf , which is assumed in the simulation .",
    "note that unlike many previous works that use similar feedback schemes , the `` kicked '' particles are not hydrodynamically decoupled at any stage .",
    "this leads to efficient entrainment of the ism by outflows which can significantly affect the properties of galaxies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the above choice of feedback parameters yields a good match to the peak of the sf rate history of the universe .",
    "the simulation feedback parameters were chosen without any regard to observables other than the peak of the cosmic sf history .    to test for numerical convergence ,",
    "the gimic  simulations have been run at three levels of numerical resolution : ` low ' , ` intermediate ' , and ` high ' .",
    "the low - resolution simulations have the same mass resolution as the millennium simulation , while the intermediate- and high - resolution simulations have @xmath38 and @xmath39 times better mass resolution , respectively .",
    "only the @xmath40 and @xmath41 volumes were run to @xmath20 at high resolution , owing to the computational expense of these calculations .",
    "we adopt the high - resolution simulations in our main analysis and make comparisons to the intermediate - resolution simulations to test for numerical convergence .",
    "the high - resolution runs have a dark matter particle mass @xmath42 m@xmath43 and an initial gas particle mass m@xmath43",
    ". however , star particles lose mass over cosmic time due to stellar evolution . ] of @xmath44 m@xmath43 .",
    "the plummer equivalent gravitational softening is @xmath45 kpc , which is fixed in physical space for @xmath46 .",
    "we present a convergence study in the appendix which shows that the simulation results pertaining to star formation efficiency , kinematics , and sizes are converged for systems with at least @xmath47 star particles . in the analysis",
    "below , we adopt a conservative lower stellar mass cut of @xmath3 = 9.0 $ ] , which corresponds to approximately @xmath48 star particles .",
    "we note , however , that a larger number of star particles appears to be required before converged ssfrs are obtained ( see the appendix ) .",
    "lastly , the gimic  simulations are based on the sph formalism .",
    "a relevant issue is whether differences in simulation techniques ( e.g. , sph , fixed mesh , moving mesh ) are important .",
    "it has been shown using idealised tests that standard sph ( which was adopted for the gimic  simulations ) has a number of problems relating to resolving fluid instabilities and the treatment of weak shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while it would be prudent to address these issues in the future ( perhaps using modifications to the sph formalism that appear to mostly resolve these issues ; e.g. , @xcite ) , we point out that both the owls @xcite and aquila @xcite projects have clearly shown that the differences obtained using different hydrodynamic techniques are small compared to the differences in the results that arise from the use of different subgrid prescriptions .",
    "below we examine the @xmath20 stellar mass - rotation velocity ( ` tully - fisher ' ) relation ( section 3.1 ) , rotation curves in bins of stellar mass ( section 3.2 ) , the mass - size relation ( section 3.3 ) , the sf efficiency of the simulated galaxies ( section 3.4 ) , the stellar mass-@xmath1 relation ( section 3.5 ) , and the stellar mass - ssfr relation ( section 3.6 ) . in each case",
    "we compare our results to a variety of recent local observations .",
    "we focus on the wide stellar mass range , @xmath7 \\le 11.5 $ ] ( which corresponds roughly to a halo mass range of @xmath49 \\la 12.7 $ ] in the simulations , where @xmath50 is the total mass within the radius , @xmath51 , that encloses a mean density of 200 times the critical density ) .",
    "the lower stellar mass limit is motivated by the numerical convergence study in the appendix , while the upper mass limit corresponds to the most massive galaxies in the simulation volumes . within this mass range",
    ", there are 714 simulated galaxies in total in the gimic @xmath52 high - resolution volumes .",
    "this includes both disc- and spheroid - dominated galaxies .    when making comparisons to the observed tully - fisher relation , the mass - size relation , the observed rotation curves of disc galaxies , the @xmath1 , and the ssfrs , it is appropriate to select only disc - dominated systems from the simulations .",
    "one way to do this is kinematically ; e.g. , to use a cut in the fractional contribution of ordered rotation to the total kinetic energy and/or angular momentum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in general it is not possible to do this kind of selection for observed galaxies .",
    "therefore , we instead adopt a simple procedure for assigning galaxies to either the disc- or spheroid - dominated categories based on the distribution of their stellar light .",
    "for each galaxy we produce a projected azimuthally - averaged surface brightness profile in the sdss i - band ( e.g. , as in @xcite ) .",
    "we fit this radial profile with a sersic law : @xmath53,\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 is the projected distance from the galaxy center , @xmath55 is the effective radius , @xmath56 is the surface brightness at @xmath55 , @xmath57 is the sersic index , and @xmath58 is a function of @xmath57 only that must be computed numerically ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . finally , to approximately mimic the depth of sdss observations , we restrict the fit to radii where @xmath59 mags .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the exact surface brightness cut adopted .",
    "we use the best - fit sersic index , @xmath57 , to assign galaxies to the disc - dominated and spheroid - dominated categories .",
    "the case of @xmath61 corresponds to a purely exponential distribution , which is known to describe the disc component of galaxies very well , while @xmath62 corresponds to the classical de vaucouleurs distribution , which has historically been used to describe the surface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite using a large sample of galaxies in the sdss that there is an approximately bimodal distribution in @xmath57 at fixed galaxy luminosity ( or stellar mass ) , in analogy to the well - known bimodal distribution of galaxy colours at fixed luminosity .",
    "red galaxies are typically those with large sersic indices ( @xmath63 ) , while blue galaxies correspond to those with relatively small values of @xmath64 on average .",
    "following @xcite , we use @xmath65 as our cut for distinguishing between disc- and spheroid - dominated systems . with this cut , there are 432 disc - dominated and 282 spheroid - dominated galaxies over the range @xmath7 \\le 11.5 $ ] ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fstar ] below , which shows the distribution of @xmath57 with galaxy stellar mass ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : tf ] we examine the relation between galaxy stellar mass and circular velocity ( @xmath66 ) for disc galaxies , which is commonly referred to as the ` tully - fisher ' ( hereafter tf ) relation . the top panel shows the relation for the case where the circular velocity is measured at the 3d radius that contains 80% of the total i - band flux in projection .",
    "we refer to this velocity as @xmath67 .",
    "the bottom panel shows the relation between the galaxy stellar mass and the maximum circular velocity , @xmath68 .",
    "we focus first on the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tf ] .",
    "the cyan points with error bars correspond to the recent measurements of @xcite .",
    "these authors selected a broad sample of galaxies from the sdss and derived rotation curves from follow - up h@xmath69 observations ( some of which were already presented in @xcite ) .",
    "although @xcite did not focus specifically on disc galaxies , the requirement that the galaxies have usable h@xmath69 rotation curves effectively weeds ellipticals out of their sample .",
    "we use their estimates of the rotation velocity , @xmath67 , and their published @xmath70-band magnitudes and @xmath71 colours to convert to stellar mass using the @xmath8 colour scalings of @xcite .",
    "we select only galaxies from @xcite with axis ratios @xmath72 in order to minimise inclination uncertainties and extinction corrections ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "comparison of simulated and observed relations between galaxy stellar mass and rotation velocity for disc galaxies ( i.e. , the ` tully - fisher ' relation ) at @xmath20 .",
    "the top panel shows the case where the velocity is measured at the radius that encloses 80% of the total i - band flux .",
    "the bottom panel uses the maximum velocity .",
    "circular velocities are used for the simulated galaxies .",
    "the simulated galaxies lie approximately on top of the observed relation over the wide range @xmath0 \\la 10.5 $ ] . at higher masses ,",
    "the simulated galaxies have circular velocities that are too large , which we show later to be due to overcooling in the largest systems . ]    over the wide range @xmath0 < 10.5 $ ] the simulated galaxies fall approximately on top of the observed relation .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the first time a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation has produced a _ population _ of galaxies that is consistent with the observed tf relation .",
    "the agreement over this mass range is not perfect ( the observed relation appears to be slightly steeper than the simulated one ) , but it is clearly a very large improvement over previous simulation studies that looked at representative populations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that @xcite have also recently examined the tf relation of a population of galaxies simulated with slightly higher resolution but in smaller boxes ( @xmath73 mpc on a side ) .",
    "their simulated tf relation has approximately the correct slope but no direct comparison was made with observations so it is unclear whether the simulation reproduces the observed zero point as well .    at higher masses ( @xmath3 \\ga 10.6 $ ] ) , the simulated galaxies have circular velocities that are significantly larger than the observed rotation velocities .",
    "this is likely the result of overcooling in massive halos ( indeed , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fstar ] below ) . this may signal that an increase in the efficiency of sn feedback is required at high masses and/or that another form of feedback ( e.g. , from active galactic nuclei , hereafter agn ) is energetically important at these mass scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on",
    "the other hand , @xcite , who also implemented only sn feedback , did not find such a sharp change in the slope of their tf relation at high masses , although due to their smaller simulation box size they had a much smaller number of high mass galaxies in their sample . in practice",
    ", the mass scale at which overcooling begins to be an issue will depend on the details of the subgrid prescriptions and the adopted parameters , as well as on the resolution .",
    "however , as many studies have demonstrated , it is not obvious that the problems at the massive end can be solved with only feedback from star formation .",
    "it also appears that the simulated tf relation has smaller scatter than the observed one .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the difference in scatter is a genuine discrepancy : since we have measured circular velocities , rather than _ gas _ rotation velocities ( which will not be perfectly circular ) , the scatter in the simulated tf relation is likely to be underestimated .",
    "particle noise ( due to our finite resolution ) inhibits the accuracy to which the gas rotation velocities can be determined in the simulations , which is why we have used circular velocities instead .",
    "in addition , scatter in the observed tf relation can be introduced by errors in corrections for disc inclination and dust attenuation ( although we have attempted to mitigate this by selecting observed galaxies within a particular axis ratio range ) , as well as errors in distance measurements . a much more careful analysis , taking into account galaxy selection criteria and observational uncertainties , is required to make quantitative statements about the degree of similarity ( or lack thereof ) in the scatter in the observed and simulated galaxy populations .    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tf ] we compare the observed and simulated tf relations using @xmath68 rather than @xmath67 .",
    "the red points with error bars represent the 21 cm measurements of @xcite , who measured the tf relation for a volume - limited complete sample of spiral galaxies in the nearby ursa major cluster .",
    "we derive stellar masses for their galaxies using their @xmath74-band magnitudes and @xmath75 colours and the @xmath8 colour scalings of @xcite .",
    "we also show the best - fit power - law relation relation of @xcite , where @xmath76 is the best - fit asymptotic velocity at large radii .",
    "for galaxies with flat rotation curves @xmath76 is obviously equivalent to @xmath68 . for galaxies with rising rotation curves , e.g. , low - mass galaxies",

    "[ fig : tf ] , we find that the simulated tf relation ( using @xmath68 ) agrees well with the observed one over the wide range @xmath0 \\la 10.5 $ ] while at higher masses the simulated galaxies have too high circular velocities with respect to observed disc galaxies of the same mass .    in terms of the degree of scatter in the @xmath79 relation , we note that the role of distance uncertainties in the observed relation should be minimal for the @xcite results , since their galaxies belong solely to the ursa major cluster .",
    "interestingly , the scatter in the @xmath79 relation of @xcite and @xcite appears to be similar to that of the simulations for galaxies with @xmath3 \\la 10.0 $ ] .",
    "a caveat to bear in mind when comparing the simulated and observed @xmath79 relations , is that @xmath68 for the simulated galaxies is the maximum circular velocity within @xmath51 , whereas for the observations it is the maximum rotation velocity within the region out to which it is possible to measure gas rotation speeds ( typically @xmath80 kpc ) .",
    "we have investigated what happens to the simulated @xmath68-@xmath81 relation when we limit the maximum radius to 2 effective radii ( to crudely mimic the extent of the hi gas ) .",
    "we find a nearly identical relationship for @xmath3 \\ga 9.5 $ ] ( the measured @xmath68 is the true one ) .",
    "however , at lower masses , the radius where the circular velocity curve peaks is beyond 2 effective radii and , consequently , the measured @xmath68 is lower than the true one , but only by @xmath82 dex on average .",
    "this has the effect of shifting the low mass simulated galaxies down so that they tend to lie in between the results of @xcite ( and @xcite ) and @xcite , yielding even better agreement between the simulations and the observations .",
    "as discussed at the beginning of section 3 , we selected the disc - dominated systems from the simulations for comparison to the observed tf relation ( of disc galaxies ) .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to comment briefly on the behaviour of the spheroid - dominated galaxies , which are not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tf ] . over the mass range where the disc - dominated simulated galaxies agree well with the observations ( @xmath0 \\la 10.5 $ ] ) ,",
    "the spheroid - dominated galaxies follow the disc - dominated trend closely .",
    "in other words , our results are insensitive to the cut in sersic index for this mass range .",
    "it is only at the highest masses where we see a noticeable difference , in the sense that the spheroid - dominated galaxies have lower circular velocities ( @xmath67 and @xmath83 at a fixed stellar mass .",
    "however , as we will show in section 3.3 , it is clear that both disc- and spheroid - dominated galaxies at high stellar masses suffer from strong overcooling with respect to observed galaxies .",
    "the tf relation encapsulates the rotation of a disc galaxy with a single number .",
    "however , since neither simulated nor observed galaxies have perfectly flat rotation curves , it is possible for simulations to lie on the observed tf relation without reproducing the rotation curves of real disc galaxies .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that the shapes of the rotation curves of normal disc galaxies are inconsistent with the predictions of the @xmath13cdm model ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as deduced from dark matter only simulations . with this motivation ,",
    "we next examine the rotation curves of observed and simulated galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : vrot ] we compare observed galaxy rotation curves with predicted galaxy circular velocity curves in 9 equal - width bins of @xmath84 spanning the range @xmath7 \\le 11.25 $ ] .",
    "the continuous black curves ( connecting filled black circles ) represent the median circular velocity profiles of the simulated galaxies and the error bars represent the 5@xmath85 and 95@xmath85 percentiles .",
    "the dot - dashed red , dashed purple , and dotted orange curves represent , respectively , the median circular velocity profiles of the dark matter , stars , and gas separately .",
    "the shaded vertical region delineates the range @xmath86 softening lengths ( @xmath87 kpc ) , where the circular velocities of the simulated galaxies are expected to be unreliable .",
    "the cyan curves represent fits to the h@xmath69 rotation curves of @xcite , which we reproduce using the best - fit arctan parameters provided by @xcite .",
    "the best - fit curves are plotted out to the radius that encloses @xmath88 of the i - band flux .    the agreement with the amplitude and shape of the observed rotation curves over the mass range @xmath0 < 10.5 $ ] is encouraging .",
    "the observed and simulated velocity curves both show a gentle rise from @xmath89 kpc out to about @xmath90 kpc , on average , before levelling off to an approximately constant value at larger radii .",
    "we note that over this range in galaxy stellar mass , dark matter is the most important contributor to the circular velocity curves in the simulated galaxies ( except in the innermost regions of the last mass bin ) , as can easily be seen by comparing the dot - dashed red curve ( dark matter ) to the dashed purple ( stars ) and dotted orange ( gas ) curves .",
    "strong deviations of the simulated circular velocity curves from the observed rotation curves are evident at higher stellar masses , however , in the sense that the simulated galaxies have mass distributions which are too concentrated , particularly in the very innermost regions ( @xmath91 kpc ) .",
    "this is clearly due to the stellar distribution being much too compact and dominant in these systems .",
    "it is worth pointing out that many observed massive galaxies _ do _ show evidence for declining rotation velocity curves ( e.g. , @xcite ) and that such behaviour can not be captured by the arctan functional form adopted by @xcite in fitting their rotation curves .",
