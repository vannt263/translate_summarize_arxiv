    "modern astrophysical and cosmological measurements strongly support existence of nonbaryonic dark matter .",
    "although the true identity of dark matter is unknown observationally and experimentally , there are several well - motivated particle - physics models that provide a candidate particle for dark matter . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) such as supersymmetric neutralinos are",
    "perhaps the most popular candidate  @xcite .",
    "as they interact with themselves as well as standard - model particles , many experiments are being carried out to look for signatures of scattering of wimps off nuclei in underground detectors and of self - annihilation of wimp particles in dark matter halos  @xcite",
    ".    recently launched fermi gamma - ray space telescope  @xcite features promising capability to detect gamma rays from wimp annihilation in the right energy range  @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent numerical simulations find that dark matter in a host halo is distributed in clumpy substructure ( subhalos )  @xcite whose masses range quite widely , potentially down to earth mass  @xcite .",
    "this feature is encouraging because annihilation probability is proportional to density squared , and thus the significant clumpiness boosts the gamma - ray yields .",
    "several avenues have been proposed for fermi to look for annihilation gamma rays : galactic center  @xcite , relatively massive substructure often associated with dwarf galaxies  @xcite , proper motions of nearby small subhalos  @xcite , diffuse gamma - ray background  @xcite , etc .",
    "there is an increasing interest in statistical analysis of the all - sky map of the gamma - ray background obtained with fermi in the near future .",
    "references  @xcite computed angular power spectrum of the gamma - ray background from annihilation in extragalactic dark matter halos , and showed that the signature would be different from that of ordinary astrophysical sources ( see also , refs .",
    "the same approach has been applied to signals from substructure in the galactic halo  @xcite .",
    "this is indeed important , because the galactic substructure typically gives a larger contribution to the diffuse gamma - ray background than extragalactic halos do  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , first the all - sky gamma - ray map was simulated from sets of subhalo models , and then the map was analyzed to obtain the angular power spectrum .",
    "in addition , one - point probability distribution function of the gamma - ray flux has also been studied  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the gamma - ray background anisotropy from dark matter annihilation in the galactic subhalos .",
    "in contrast to the earlier works  @xcite that heavily relied on mock gamma - ray maps generated from subhalo models , we develop an analytic approach to compute the angular power spectrum directly . this way , we are able to calculate the angular power spectrum easily and more quickly , if we specify some input parameters and characteristics of galactic subhalos",
    ". this would be in particular useful when we have results of actual fermi data analysis , and try to give physical interpretation for them .",
    "we find that the angular power spectrum @xmath5 is divided into two parts : one depending on ( ensemble - averaged ) distribution of subhalos in a host ( `` two - subhalo '' term , @xmath6 ) , and the other depending on the emissivity profile of single subhalos as well as the number of subhalos significantly contributing to the background intensity ( `` one - subhalo '' term , @xmath7 ) .",
    "the latter would be shot noise if the subhalos were completely point sources , but fermi will be able to see deviations from the shot noise due to the angular extension of the relevant subhalos . using the latest subhalo models following recent numerical simulations , we give predictions for the angular power spectrum , and",
    "show that the multipole range @xmath8 would be a favorable window for anisotropy detection .",
    "we also discuss the detectability of the angular power spectrum from subhalos with fermi , which turns out to be promising , potentially better than the detection of subhalos as identified gamma - ray sources .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : formulation ] , we give formulation for angular power spectrum as well as mean intensity of the gamma - ray background .",
    "these formulae derived are applied to several subhalo models in the subsequent sections . in sec .  [",

    "we assume that a fraction @xmath9 of the mass of the galactic halo is in the form of subhalos , and @xmath10 is distributed as a smooth halo . for the density profile of the milky - way dark matter halo , we adopt a spherically symmetric navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the galactocentric radius ,",

    "<S> we study the gamma - ray background anisotropy due to the subhalos and discuss detectability at fermi gamma - ray space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to earlier work that relies on simulated all - sky maps , we derive analytic formulae that enable to directly compute the angular power spectrum , given parameters of subhalos such as mass function and radial profile of gamma - ray luminosity . as our fiducial subhalo models , we adopt @xmath0 mass spectrum , subhalos radial distribution suppressed towards the galactic center , and luminosity profile of each subhalo dominated by its smooth component . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for multipole regime corresponding to @xmath1 , the angular power spectrum is dominated by a noise - like term , with suppression due to internal structure of relevant subhalos . </S>",
    "<S> if the mass spectrum extends down to earth - mass scale , then the subhalos would be detected in the anisotropy with fermi at angular scales of @xmath210@xmath3 , if their contribution to the gamma - ray background is larger than @xmath220% . </S>",
    "<S> if the minimum mass is around @xmath4 , on the other hand , the relevant angular scale for detection is @xmath21@xmath3 , and the anisotropy detection requires that the subhalo contribution to the gamma - ray background intensity is only @xmath24% . </S>",
    "<S> these can be achieved with a modest boost for particle physics parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the anisotropy analysis could be a more sensitive probe for the subhalos than individual detection . </S>",
    "<S> we also study dependence on model parameters , where we reach the similar conclusions for all the models investigated </S>",
    "<S> . the analytic approach should be very useful when fermi data are analyzed and the obtained angular power spectrum is interpreted in terms of subhalo models . </S>"
