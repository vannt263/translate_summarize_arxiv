    "in the last two decades , there has been huge progress in understanding the four - dimensional @xmath1 supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( sym ) .",
    "the @xmath1 sym is supposed to have many special properties such as superconformal symmetry @xcite , uv finiteness @xcite , s - duality @xcite , integrability @xcite , dual conformal symmetry @xcite and so on .",
    "the @xmath1 sym also provides the canonical example of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , where the @xmath1 sym is dual to type iib superstring on @xmath6 . the ads / cft correspondence has stimulated our understanding on the @xmath1 sym and vice versa .",
    "however almost of the progress is based on weak coupling perturbation theory , planar limit or protected observables .",
    "recently it has turned out that the conformal bootstrap approach @xcite is very powerful tool for the @xmath1 sym @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "indeed the @xmath1 superconformal bootstrap @xcite gives strong constraints on dimensions of unprotected leading twist operators with various spins , which are @xmath7 singlets and non - bps primary operators belonging to long representation of the @xmath1 superconformal group .",
    "the leading twist operators in the @xmath1 sym at classical level are so - called twist - two operators defined by    _",
    "m = tr^i d^m ^i , m=0,2,4 , , [ eq : twist2 ]    where @xmath8 is the adjoint scalar .",
    "the @xmath1 superconformal bootstrap finds rigorous bounds on the dimensions within numerical errors , which are fully non - perturbative even for finite @xmath5 and independent of the complex gauge coupling @xmath9 .",
    "the authors in @xcite have also conjectured that the upper bounds on the dimensions are saturated at either @xmath3 or @xmath4 , which are the duality invariant points under @xmath10-transformation and @xmath11-transformation , respectively .",
    "main purpose of this paper is to study the dimensions of the leading twist operators in the @xmath0 @xmath1 sym by a completely different approach .",
    "then we find approximate formula of the dimensions by resumming perturbative data with help of the s - duality @xcite and ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "our approximation tool is interpolating function , which has been used mainly for interpolation of two perturbative expansions around two different points in parameter space .",
    "the most standard approach for this is ( two - point ) pad approximant , which is a rational function having the two expansions up to some orders .",
    "recently sen constructed another type of interpolating function , which has the form of a fractional power of polynomial ( fpp ) @xcite .",
    "a more general form of the interpolating function with the form of fractional powers of rational function ( fpr ) has been constructed out in @xcite by one of the current authors .",
    "it has turned out that these interpolating functions usually provide better approximations than each perturbative expansion in intermediate regime of the parameter .",

    "our interpolating functions are modular invariants to reproduce the correct weak coupling expansion and large t hooft coupling limit in the planar limit .",
    "such attempt was initiated in @xcite , which has constructed interpolating functions invariant under one particular element of @xmath13 such as @xmath10- and @xmath14-transformations . in @xcite",
    "the authors constructed a class of interpolating functions , which is similar to fpp @xcite but invariant under all the elements of @xmath13 . here",
    "we construct a new class of interpolating functions by combining the ideas of fpr @xcite and alday - bissi @xcite , and further imposing a consistency with the previous holographic results .",
    "our interpolating functions give predictions for arbitrary values of @xmath5 and the complex gauge coupling @xmath2 .",
    "we compare our result with the recent results by the @xmath1 superconformal bootstrap and test the conjecture that the upper bounds on the dimensions are saturated at one of the duality - invariant points . as a conclusion we find that when we expect reasonable approximation by the interpolating functions , the interpolating functions have their the maximal values at @xmath4 , which are close to the conjectural values of the @xmath1 superconformal bootstrap .    in terms of the interpolating functions ,",
    "we also study image of conformal manifold in the space of the dimensions of the leading twist operators .",
    "we find that the image is a very narrow line despite we vary the coupling @xmath2 in the two - dimensional fundamental region .",
    "the narrow line is almost straight for @xmath15 as in the result by different interpolating functions @xcite while it is curved for @xmath16 contrary to @xcite .",
    "we also construct interpolating functions for the subleading twist operator .",
    "since the operator @xmath17 in has the dimension @xmath18 in the weak coupling limit while this becomes very large for strong t hooft coupling in the planar limit , we expect the level crossing with the subleading twist operator in the planar limit , whose dimension is constant . on the other hand ,",
    "since the dilatation operator in the @xmath1 sym corresponds to the hamiltonian on @xmath19 , we expect that the dimensions obey the wigner - von neumann non - crossing rule , which states that levels of states with the same symmetry can not cross each other .",
    "this implies that the level crossing does not occur for finite @xmath5 .",
    "we check that the interpolating functions for the leading and subleading twist operators with spin-0 do not cross each other for finite @xmath5 .",
    "we also study the dimension of the konishi operator in the planar limit .",
    "we construct interpolating functions consistent with the weak coupling expansion and holographic computation .",
    "we compare our result with numerical data obtained by thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) and find that our interpolating functions matches with the tba result .",
    "we also discuss that analytic property of the interpolating function reflects expectations on radius of convergence from weak coupling perturbation theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : anomdim ] we briefly explain the previous results obtained by the weak coupling perturbation theory , holographic computation , and superconformal bootstrap . in section [ sec : interpolating ] we begin with introducing interpolating functions constructed previously .",

    "the twist - two operator @xmath27 has very large anomalous dimension @xcite and the leading twist operator is a double trace operator with the schematic form    tr(^(i ^j ) ) d^m tr(^(i ^j ) ) , [ eq:20prime ]    where @xmath31 is symmetric traceless part of @xmath32 and chiral primary operator belonging to @xmath33 representation$ ] .",

    "thus we should be careful on this .",

    "the coefficients in the interpolating function are determined only by the perturbative part of the eisenstein series :    .",
    "e_s ( ) |_perturbative = ( 2s ) g^-s + ( 2s-1 ) g^s-1 .    in particular for large @xmath48 , the coefficients are determined by the first term .",
    "since @xmath198 is almost unity for sufficiently large @xmath48 , the interpolating functions for large @xmath48 is approximately given by    f_m^(s , ) ( ) ^.    thus the coefficients @xmath146 and @xmath147 are almost independent of @xmath48 for very large @xmath48 .",
    "because of this , the interpolating function in weak coupling regime is almost independent of @xmath48 for large-@xmath48 .    next we ask if values of the interpolating functions at the duality invariant points are also almost independent of @xmath48 for large @xmath48 or not . for this purpose",
    ", we should know values of @xmath199 and @xmath200 for large @xmath48 . by using @xmath201 with @xmath202 for large @xmath48",
    ", we find    e_s ( i)2 , e_s ( e^ ) 3 ( ) ^s ,  s1 .",
    "therefore the interpolating functions at the duality invariant points are given by    f_m^(s , ) ( i ) ^,f_m^(s , ) ( e^ ) ^ ,  s1 .",
    "thus the interpolating function at the duality fixed points is independent of @xmath48 for large-@xmath48 .",
    "in the main text , we have approximated the dimensions of the leading twist operators by the interpolating functions , which are consistent with the weak coupling expansions , holographic results and full @xmath25-duality .",
    "as the holographic results , we have used the results for the double trace operators , which are the subleading twist operators in the weak coupling regime .",
    "this is because the operator is dual to the massive string state and acquires the very large dimension in the classical string regime .",
    "however , one may wonder if one can construct another modular invariant interpolating functions , which have the same weak coupling expansions but different behaviors as @xmath204 in the classical string regime .",
    "this may not make sense physically since the dimension would not be modular invariant but this may be useful for constructing interpolating functions for other modular invariants with different behaviors in the classical string regime in the future . thus in this appendix",
    ", we try to construct a class of modular interpolating functions , with the same weak coupling expansion and @xmath203 behavior in the classical string limit .    to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the konishi operator , namely the spin-0 case .",
    "the dimensions of the konishi operator behaves as for weak coupling and for large-@xmath52 in the planar limit .",
    "now we would like to construct interpolating functions , which are consistent with , and the full @xmath25-duality . as a conclusion",
    ", we could not find single interpolating function satisfying these properties but we find a linear combination of multiple interpolating functions to satisfy the above properties , which are slight modifications of .",
    "first we have found that the interpolating functions of the type , which have been used for the leading twist operators in the main text , can not satisfy the above properties .",
    "indeed we have explicitly checked this for various cases and we can also show this for large-@xmath48 in the following way . recall that the coefficients @xmath146 and @xmath147 in are determined in terms of only perturbative part of the eisenstein series @xmath143 .",
    "although the perturbative part of @xmath143 has @xmath205 part and @xmath206 part , only @xmath205 part is relevant to determine the coefficients for large-@xmath48 .",
    "thus @xmath146 and @xmath147 are effectively determined by    ^.    while @xmath146 and @xmath147 are nontrivial function of @xmath5 in general , we know that their planar limits behave as @xmath207 since the anomalous dimension is @xmath54 in the planar limit .",
    "hence in the planar limit , the interpolating function becomes    ^ ,    where @xmath208 and @xmath209 . since this function becomes @xmath54 for large-@xmath52 , the interpolating function for large-@xmath48 can not have the @xmath203-law in the classical string limit .",
    "thus we shall consider different types of interpolating functions .    alternatively",
    "let us consider the following type of interpolating functions    i_m^(s , t , ) ( ) = ^ , [ eq : inter_t ]    where the only difference from is the presence of the new parameter @xmath210 in the first term of the numerator .",
    "note that @xmath210 should be integer to get weak coupling expansion with only integer powers of @xmath44 . by a similar argument as above",
    ", we find that the planar limit of this interpolating function for large-@xmath48 is given by    .",
    "i_m^(s , t , ) ( ) |_planar = ^ = ^ ,    where @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "when @xmath210 is negative , the leading order of this function in the large-@xmath52 expansion is @xmath211 .",
    "thus the interpolating function of the class can have the @xmath203-law in the classical string limit by appropriately choosing @xmath131 and @xmath210 .",
    "however the interpolating function @xmath212 with @xmath213 can not correctly reproduce the subleading order of , namely @xmath54 .",
    "the reason is that if we consider @xmath214 with large-@xmath48 , then the @xmath203-law uniquely but this case also does not have @xmath54 in the large-@xmath52 expansion . ]",
    "requires @xmath215 and therefore the subleading order is @xmath216 rather than @xmath54 .",
    "thus we can not single interpolating function consistent with , and the full @xmath25-duality by the type .",
    "alternatively we find that the following linear combination of @xmath217 satisfies the desired properties :    w_1 i_4^(s,-1,-1/4 ) ( ) + w_2 i_4^(s,0 , ) ( ) + w_3 i_4^(s,-1,1/4 ) ( ) ,  w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 1 .",
    "since this is not single function and we have infinite choices of @xmath218 , it is in general hard to construct a consistent interpolating function , we defer such issues for future investigations .",
    "in this appendix we present explicit forms of the interpolating functions used in the main text .",
    "although we often write their coefficients with 6 digits to avoid too long expressions , we practically use analytic expressions or infinite digits in mathematica files .",
