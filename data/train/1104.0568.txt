    "one possibility to see that the expression @xmath4 is an integer for any choice of @xmath5 is to find combinatorial objects that are enumerated by this quantity .",

    "the combinatorial extension of @xmath17 is , generally speaking , a signed enumeration , which reduces to a plain enumeration in the first and in the second case if @xmath18 is strictly increasing .",
    "this can be generalized as follows .",
    "[ boundary ] suppose @xmath19 is a weakly increasing sequence of integers then @xmath17 is the number of gelfand - tsetlin patterns with prescribed bottom row @xmath20 and where all other rows are strictly increasing .",
    "_ in order to see this , we use the first extension .",
    "suppose @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a respective pattern . as @xmath23 it follows",
    "that @xmath24 equal to this quantity as well and at least one of @xmath24 and @xmath25 must be special .",
    "we can exclude the latter possibility by the following sign reversing involution on the extended monotone triangles where @xmath25 is special in such a situation : let @xmath26 be maximal with this property .",
    "then , changing the status of @xmath24 ( from special to not special or vice versa ) is a sign reversing involution .",
    "thus we can assume that @xmath25 is not special ( and , consequently , @xmath24 must be special ) whenever we have @xmath23 .",
    "this can be used to show that @xmath27 if there are @xmath28 with @xmath29 such that @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 , which is one special case of the statement : as @xmath34 can be assume not to be special ( which already settles the case @xmath35 ) we can deduce that @xmath36 is not special ( otherwise we would have no choice for @xmath34 ) and , by iterating this argument , we can see that @xmath24 is not special for @xmath37 .",
    "this implies that @xmath38 . on the other hand , the fact that @xmath39 is special implies @xmath40 , which is a contradiction .",
    "thus we may assume that such @xmath28 do not exist for our sequence @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath21 then @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "as @xmath24 is special and @xmath25 is not , we have @xmath43 .",
    "it should be remarked that the signed enumeration in the first and in the second extension is in general not a plain enumeration if @xmath44 is weakly increasing but not strictly increasing .",
    "also note that the proposition is equivalent to the fact that , for weakly increasing sequences @xmath6 , the application of the summation in to @xmath45 is equivalent to the application of the representation of this summation in terms of simple summations to @xmath45 .",
    "( if the sequence is not increasing then the summation in is over the emptyset and therefore zero . ) as a next step , it would be interesting to figure out whether there is a notion analog to that of gelfand - tsetlin tree sequences for monotone triangles",
    ". this could be helpful in understanding the properties of @xmath17 , which we list next .",
    "in previous papers we have shown that @xmath17 has the following properties .    1 .   for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 ( this is proved in @xcite . ) 2 .   for @xmath46 and @xmath49",

    "( see @xcite . )",
    "3 .   for @xmath46",
    ", we have @xmath51 .",
    "( a proof can be found in @xcite . )",
    "4 .   for @xmath46 and @xmath52",
    ", we have @xmath53 ( see lemma  1 in @xcite . )    the first property is obviously the analog of the shift - antisymmetry of @xmath54 as the latter can obviously be formulated as follows .",
    "@xmath55 it is interesting to note that a special case of this property for @xmath17 follows from proposition  [ boundary ] : if we specialize @xmath56 then the first property simplifies to @xmath57 however , for integers @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , proposition  [ boundary ] implies this identity : in a monotone triangle @xmath22 with bottom row @xmath61 we have either @xmath62 , which corresponds to the case that we have @xmath63 as bottom row , or @xmath64 , which corresponds to the case that @xmath65 is the bottom row . as a polynomial in @xmath58",
    "is uniquely determined by its values on the set of these elements @xmath66 , the identity follows .",
    "concerning the second property , we have seen that it also holds for @xmath67 .",
    "both properties together actually imply , see @xcite , and thus it would be interesting to give combinatorial proofs of these properties .      the third property is interesting as it holds also for gelfand - tsetlin patterns where it can easily be deduced from the shift - antisymmetry .",
    "however , it is a mystery that it also holds for monotone triangles , as we do not see how it can be deduced from the first property .",
    "quite remarkably , it can be used to deduce the refined alternating sign matrix theorem as we explain next .",
    "the number @xmath68 of @xmath69 alternating sign matrices , where the unique @xmath70 in the first row is located in the @xmath71-th column is equal to the number of monotone triangles with bottom row @xmath72 and @xmath71 appearances of @xmath70 in the first ne - diagonal , or , equivalently , the number of monotone triangles with bottom row @xmath72 and @xmath71 appearances of @xmath7 in the last se - diagonal .",
    "( this follows immediately from the standard bijection between alternating sign matrices and monotone triangles . )",
    "if we assume that @xmath73 , then the number of `` partial '' monotone triangles with @xmath7 rows , where the entries @xmath74 are removed , no entry is smaller than @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 is equal to @xmath78 ( a proof is given in @xcite . ) in fact , it follows quite easily by induction with respect to @xmath71 as @xmath79 this implies the first identity in @xmath80 the proof of the fact that the first expression is also equal to the last expression is similar . therefore , by property ( 3 ) , @xmath81 we use @xmath82 to see that this is equal to @xmath83 this shows that the refined alternating sign matrix numbers @xmath68 are a solution of the following system of linear equations .",
    "@xmath84 in @xcite , it was shown that this system of linear equations together with the obvious symmetry @xmath85 determines the numbers @xmath68 inductively with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a similar reasoning can be applied to the doubly refined enumeration @xmath86 of @xmath69 alternating sign matrices with respect to the position @xmath71 of the @xmath70 in first row and the position @xmath26 of the @xmath70 in the last row .",
    "this number is equal to the number of monotone triangles with bottom row @xmath72 and @xmath71 appearances of @xmath70 in the first ne - diagonal and @xmath26 appearances of @xmath7 in the last se - diagonal , which implies ( see @xcite ) that @xmath87 using the first and the third property of @xmath17 displayed above we deduce the following identity .",
    "@xmath88 we apply @xmath89 to the equivalent identity @xmath90 to see that @xmath91 now we use the expansions @xmath92 and @xmath93 to see that @xmath94 we evaluate at @xmath95 to arrive at @xmath96 computer experiments led us to the conjecture that this identity together with the obvious relations @xmath97 and @xmath98 determine the doubly refined enumeration numbers @xmath86 uniquely inductively with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "the analog of the fourth property is true for gelfand - tsetlin tree sequences , see , for which we gave a combinatorial proof in section  [ diff ] .",
    "the significance of this property is that it can be used to deduce the third property from the first property .",
    "since every symmetric polynomial in @xmath99 can be written as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric functions , this property implies that @xmath100 for every symmetric polynomial @xmath101 in @xmath102 .",
    "this extends to symmetric polynomials in @xmath103 : let @xmath101 be such a polynomial and @xmath104 such that @xmath105 is a symmetric polynomial in @xmath102 then @xmath106 in particular , this shows that is also true if all `` @xmath107 ' 's are replaced by `` @xmath108 ' 's .",
    "now we are ready to deduce property ( 3 ) from property ( 1 ) and property ( 4 ) : note that the operator @xmath109 is invertible as an operator on polynomials in @xmath110 and @xmath111 : this follows as @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( the sum is finite when applied to polynomials . ) property ( 1 ) is obviously equivalent to @xmath114 this implies @xmath115 therefore , in order to show the third property , we have to prove that @xmath116 this follows from the fourth property as @xmath117",
    "in figure  [ gesselfigure ] , the family of non - intersecting lattice paths that corresponds to the gelfand - tsetlin pattern given in the introduction is displayed : in general , the lattice paths join the starting points @xmath118 to the end points @xmath119 , where the lattice paths can take east and north steps of length @xmath70 and end with a step to the east . as indicated in the drawing , the heights of the horizontal steps of the @xmath71-th path , counted from the bottom , can be obtained from the @xmath71-th southeast diagonal of the gelfand - tsetlin pattern , counted from the left , by adding @xmath71 to the entries in the respective diagonal of the gelfand - tsetlin pattern . by a well - known result on the enumeration of non - intersecting lattice paths of lindstrm (",

    "( note that @xmath121 is a polynomial in @xmath122 of degree @xmath123 . )",
    "interestingly , another possibility to extend the combinatorial interpretation of to all @xmath124 is related to this interpretation in terms of families of non - intersection lattice paths : for arbitrary non - negative integers @xmath18 , consider families of @xmath7 lattice paths with unit steps to the north and to the east ( in general , these families are intersecting for the moment ) that connect the starting points @xmath118 to the endpoints @xmath125 , in any order .",
    "( now we omit the vertical steps at the end of the paths . )",
    "suppose that the @xmath71-th starting point @xmath126 is connected to the @xmath127-th end point @xmath128 then the sign of the family is defined as the sign of the permutation @xmath129 .",
    "then , is the signed enumeration of families of lattice paths with these starting points and end points .",
    "the merit of the theorem of lindstrm and of gessel and viennot is the definition of a sign reversion involution on the families of _ intersecting _ lattice paths , which shows that only the non - intersecting families remain in the signed enumeration .",
    "depending on the relative positions of the numbers @xmath130 , there is only one permutation @xmath131 for which a family of non - intersecting lattice paths exists at all .",
    "this implies that the signed enumeration of families of lattice paths reduces essentially ( i.e. up to the sign of @xmath131 ) to the plain enumeration of families of non - intersecting lattice paths .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning ( without proof ) that the requirement that all @xmath10 are non - negative can be avoided . a close look at",
    "the proof shows that this requirement is useful at first place to guarantee that the location of the end points is not `` too far '' to the south of the starting points .",
    "if an end point is south - east of a starting point then there is obviously no lattice path connecting them which only uses steps of the form @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "however , in such a case it is convenient to allow steps of the form @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "moreover if we require these paths to start with a step of the form @xmath135 and let each step of the form @xmath134 contribute a minus sign , we obtain an interpretation of for all @xmath5 . a typical situation is sketched in figure  [ paths2 ] .",
    "we sketch a ( sort of ) combinatorial proof of the shift - antisymmetry of the signed enumeration of gelfand - tsetlin _ patterns _ with prescribed bottom row which does not rely on the notion of gelfand - tsetlin tree sequences .",
    "the argument is a bit involved and thus shows the merit of the notion of gelfand - tsetlin tree sequences . on the other hand",
    ", it could be helpful for proving the analog property for monotone triangles as we have not established a notion that is analog to that of gelfand - tsetlin tree sequences for monotone triangles so far , see section  [ concluding ] .",
    "the following notion turns out to be extremely useful in order to avoid case distinctions : we define @xmath136:= \\{z \\in \\mathbb{z } | x \\le z \\le y\\}$ ] if @xmath137 as usual , @xmath138 : = \\emptyset$ ] and @xmath136 : = [ y+1,x-1]$ ] if @xmath139 .",

    "nothing is to be done for @xmath149 .",
    "otherwise , it suffices to consider the case @xmath150 .",
