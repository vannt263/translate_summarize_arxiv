    "plastic deformation of amorphous solids and , more generally , of jammed disordered media ( foams , confined granular media , colloidal glasses ,  ) has been intensively studied in the past two decades .",
    "general agreement is now gradually emerging about the nature of the elementary dissipative events in these highly multistable systems .",
    "they consist in sudden rearrangements of small clusters comprising a few basic structural units , such as @xmath2 events in dry foams . in the case of glasses , where they can not be observed directly ,",
    "progress has come , following the pioneer work of argon and collaborators , from extensive numerical studies  @xcite .",
    "more recently , simulations performed on model systems  lennard - jones ( lj ) glasses  have proved very helpful to improve our understanding of the effect of topological disorder on the elastic as well as plastic shear response of amorphous solids .",
    "md simulations are instrumental in elucidating the thermal dependence of the flow stress @xmath3 in the high strain rate ( @xmath4 ) regime . however , such conditions ( finite @xmath5 , high @xmath6 ) `` blur '' the microscopic motion , making it difficult to characterize precisely the elementary events , which are the building blocks on which constitutive laws should be based . for this purpose",
    ", a second class of numerical works have focussed on the athermal ( @xmath7 ) , quasi - static ( @xmath8 ) regime . in this later regime ,",
    "hereafter abbreviated as aqs , when a sample is sheared at constant rate , the stress - strain @xmath9 curve exhibits ( see figure  [ fig : stressstrain ] ) elastic branches interrupted by discontinuous drops @xmath10 which are the signature of the dissipative events . beyond an initial transient",
    ", @xmath11 fluctuates about an average value @xmath12 , which is identified with the yield stress @xmath13 .",
    "the distribution of stress drops is broad and system - size dependent . in their study on a 2d lj glass , maloney and lemaitre  @xcite were able to analyze them in terms of cascades of elementary events , which we will term `` flips '' .",
    "each such flip involves both the strong rearrangement of a small cluster ( @xmath14 a few atoms ) , and the appearance of an associated quadrupolar elastic field .",
    "this result substantiates the representation of elementary processes as eshelby - like  @xcite shear transformations  @xcite",
    ".    however , it appears desirable to analyze aqs simulations in more detail , in order to shed light upon debated questions concerning phenomenologies based on the notion of shear transformation zones ( stz )  @xcite .",
    "namely :     can the flipping clusters be associated with regions of the disordered solid which retain their identity over a finite range of elastic loading before they reach their instability threshold ?",
    " if so , do the simulations give information about the response of a zone to the elastic field generated by the flip of another zone ?",
    " can one evaluate the relative importance of the dynamic noise resulting from this mechanism as compared with disorder - induced fluctuations of the non - affine elastic field ?",
    "stress - strain curve for a @xmath15 system .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to address these issues , we extend in this article a recent study on a 2d lj glass  @xcite , by tanguy et al , which confirms that plastic flow is spatially heterogeneous .",
    "they claim that one should distinguish between two types of plastic events : strongly localized ones occurring during the initial loading phase ( @xmath16 ) , and non - localized ones which they term `` non - permanent shear bands '' .",
    "they also investigate atomic motion in the direction transverse to the plastic flow .",
    "while they find it to be diffusive at long times , they conclude to its hyperdiffusive nature on short time intervals .",
    "transverse displacements are purely non - affine and , as indicated by the jagged shape of the @xmath11 curve , consist of a succession of possibly noisy elastic episodes interspersed with sudden atomic rearrangements associated with the plastic events , hence the interest of a detailed analysis of their dynamics . with this remark in mind , we revisit in section ii the analysis of transverse particle motion , now explicitly separating elastic and plastic contributions .",
    "we thus extract information about _",
    "( i ) _ correlations between plastic events _ ( ii ) _ the elastic contribution to the non - affine noise invoked in the phenomenological stz model of falk and langer  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we find it inappropriate to qualify global transverse particle motion as hyperdiffusive at short times . indeed",
    ", the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath17 smoothly increases with @xmath18 from a _",
    "finite _ short time value @xmath19 to the asymptotic value @xmath20 .",
    "noticeably , the whole @xmath21 curve is _ system size dependent _  a result which appears consistent with the analysis of plastic events in terms of flip cascades .",
    "we also show that the contribution of plastic events to transverse diffusion dominates markedly over the effect of disorder - induced non - affine elastic fluctuations . in section iii , on the basis of close inspection of the evolution of the spatial structure of the infinitesimal non - affine field , we show that our results can be interpreted in terms of the elastic loading of zones driven by shear , which soften gradually as they approach their spinodal limit .",
    "as they approach this threshold , these zones give rise to quadrupolar fields of growing amplitude .",
    "the zones thus identified can be traced back over shear intervals substantially larger than the average interval between plastic events , the effect of which is thus easily observable .",
    "these observations support a description in terms of elastically loaded zones , and point towards the relevance of the dynamical noise generated by plastic flips themselves . the associated inter - zone elastic couplings should be responsible for the `` autocatalytic avalanches ''  @xcite or flip cascades  @xcite constituting the system - size dependent plastic events , which we believe to be precisely the non - permanent shear bands invoked in ref.@xcite .",
    "we attribute the stronger localization of initial events to the smaller density of nearly unstable zones in the as - quenched or weakly stressed samples .",
    "this empirical study thus leads to the emergence of a phenomenology of the non - affine shear response summarized in section iv .",
    "while supporting the concept of shear transformation zones ( stz ) or , equivalently , elastically loaded traps ( sgr ) , it diverges from these models about two of their basic assumptions , namely independence of elementary events and the nature of noise .",
    "we think that it should be of use for further developments in the modelization of plasticity of amorphous media .",
    "we use here the same binary lj mixture as that of ref.@xcite , namely large ( l ) and small(s ) particle radii and numbers are : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "these values ensure that no crystallization occurs at low temperature .",
    "simple shear deformation is imposed using lees - edwards boundary conditions .",
    "we study systems of three different sizes @xmath25 , with @xmath26 .",
    "the quasi - static regime corresponds to the limit where the external time scale @xmath27 is much larger than that of internal relaxation processes .",
    "the system , starting from local equilibrium , thus follows adiabatically the shear - induced evolution of the corresponding energy minimum up to the spinodal limit where this minimum disappears and the system jumps into another local minimum of lower energy .",
    "the simulation proceeds as follows : a small increment @xmath28 of homogeneous shear strain is imposed , then energy is minimized using a conjugate gradient algorithm with a stringent convergence criterion ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "we choose @xmath29 , small enough to ensure that , for our system sizes , all elastic branches are well resolved .",
    "a typical @xmath11 curve is displayed on figure  [ fig : stressstrain ] .",
    "starting from an initial quench , we explore the shear range @xmath30 . in order to characterize the stationary state",
    ", we only retain data for @xmath31 , which ensures that initial transients are discarded , thus making details of the quenching protocol immaterial .",
    "we have been able to collect data on @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 systems of respective sizes @xmath35 .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we make extensive use of the so - called non - affine tangent field @xmath36 , defined as the difference between the linear response of particle displacements to an increment of homogeneous strain and the corresponding homogeneous field .",
    "it is well - defined , and is computed , everywhere along each elastic branch .      in",
    "plastically deforming amorphous systems , non - affine displacement fields contain information about both , departures from standard continuum elastic behavior and the nature of plastic events .",
    "in our simple shear geometry , transverse particle displacements @xmath37 are purely non - affine , while longitudinal ones mix affine and non - affine contributions .",
    "we thus focus on the normalized distributions @xmath38 of the @xmath39 s for a fixed strain interval @xmath40 .",

    "namely ( see figure  [ fig:2 ] ) @xmath44 has a quasi - gaussian center and exhibits , beyond @xmath47 , an exponential tail .",
    "its fine structure shows more clearly in the log - lin representation of the distribution @xmath48 of the scale variable @xmath49 . as displayed on figure  [ fig:3 ] , for small strain intervals (",
    "@xmath50 a few units ) , the corresponding curves exhibit a peak at small @xmath46 in the @xmath51 range , together with a broad hump for larger values . as @xmath40 increases , the peak shifts to the right and the hump amplitude grows , though without noticeable horizontal shift , until both merge , for @xmath52 .",

    "system size : @xmath45 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    can we interpret this structure and its evolution in the light of the succession of elastic and plastic episodes which reflect into the sawtooth shape of the @xmath56 response ?",
    "clearly , particle motion consists of a series of continuous trajectories interrupted by sudden jumps associated , respectively , with elastic episodes and plastic events .",
    "since @xmath28 is our numerical strain resolution , each interval of length @xmath28 is , within our accuracy , defined as either purely elastic or purely plastic .",
    "so , for @xmath57 , we can decompose @xmath58 ( and likewise @xmath59 ) as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the fraction of `` plastic intervals '' in our ensemble , and @xmath62 ( resp .",
    "@xmath63 ) are the normalized distributions associated with the plastic ( resp .",
    "elastic ) sub - ensemble .",
    "it now clearly appears ( see figure  [ fig:4 ] ) that the small @xmath46 behavior of @xmath44 results entirely from elastic motion , while its hump and large-@xmath46 tail are due to plastic events .     decomposition of the total distributions @xmath53 ( thick solid lines ) , for @xmath64 . for increasing @xmath65 s , the maximum of the distribution shifts rightwards .",

    "we extend the above decomposition to @xmath67 , now defining as `` plastic '' any interval containing at least one plastic event .",
    "as @xmath40 increases while remaining small with respect to the average length ( @xmath68 ) of an elastic branch , most plastic intervals in general still contain only one plastic event , so that their fraction @xmath69 , while @xmath62 remains quasi unchanged , because the scale of plastic slips is large compared with that of elastic ones .",
    "this explains the evolution ( figure  [ fig:4 ] ) of the plastic hump which , as @xmath40 increases , consists primarily in an upward shift with little change in shape .    in this regime , which corresponds to @xmath70 ( @xmath71 for the @xmath72 system ) , the fraction @xmath73 of purely elastic intervals remains nearly constant ( e.g. , for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) , so that the variations with @xmath40 of the elastic part of @xmath66 , @xmath77 , directly reveal those of @xmath78 .",
    "inspection of the numerical data suggests ( see also figure  [ fig:4 ] ) that the rightward shifts of @xmath79 are roughly equal to @xmath80 .",
    "the plot ( figure  [ fig:5 ] ) of @xmath81 _ vs _ @xmath82 ) ) shows that the collapse is indeed excellent in the low and middle ranges of @xmath83 values , but fails in the large @xmath46 tails .     the function @xmath78 plotted versus @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "the arrow indicates the direction of _ increasing _",
    "system size @xmath45 . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    this collapse means that _ during the purely elastic episodes separating plastic events non - affine displacements are essentially convective _ : the @xmath86-derivative of the @xmath87 field is nearly constant over most of an elastic episode .",
    "this amounts to stating that the tangent non - affine field @xmath88 , although spatially disordered  @xcite , remains quasi - quenched .",
    "now , we know from ref .",
    "@xcite that this can not be true when the system comes close below a spinodal threshold @xmath89",
    ". indeed , in these near - critical regions , a gradually softening elastic mode develops , leading to a @xmath90 divergence of @xmath88 . clearly , it is the contribution of these near - critical softened configurations which explains the large-@xmath46 tails of @xmath78 .",
    "the tail deflation ( figure  [ fig:5 ] ) results from the fact that , as the interval @xmath40 increases , the weight of these soft configurations is gradually transferred from @xmath78 to @xmath91 .",
    "this analysis clarifies the physical significance of the shape of @xmath38 in the moderate @xmath40 range ( where its non - gaussian parameter remains large  @xcite ) : _",
    "( i ) _ its quasi - gaussian center  @xcite results from small - scale non - affine displacements accumulated along purely elastic segments , during which particle trajectories are essentially convected . _",
    "( ii ) _ its quasi - exponential tail arises from plastic jumps during plastic events .    for larger @xmath92 , however , the decomposition of equation ( [ eq : decomp ] ) loses physical content since the statistical weight of elastic intervals vanishes while @xmath91 mixes both elastic and plastic contributions . in order to circumvent this limitation ,",
    "we concentrate in the following on the evolution with @xmath40 of the second moment @xmath93 .      in order to elucidate the nature of the transverse particule dynamics ,",
    "we have computed from our data the space and ensemble average @xmath93 for increasing values of @xmath40 . on figure  [ fig:6 ]",
    "we plot the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath94 . for our three system sizes",

    "error bars result from a standard student analysis of the data .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    again , in order to shed light on the origin of this behavior , let us separate explicitly the elastic and plastic contributions to non - affine particle motion .",
    "indeed , we can write : @xmath102 where @xmath103 labels the strain values where irreversible events ( avalanches ) occur , so that : @xmath104 with @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath107 the corresponding cross - correlated and plastic - plastic contributions .",
    "these three functions carry the information about self and cross correlations of elastic and plastic non - affine displacements .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath108 limit .",
    "a straightforward asymptotic analysis taking into account the square - root divergence of the tangent field @xmath109 at spinodal points leads to : @xmath110    @xmath111    so , their contribution to @xmath95 vanishes , and the finite value of @xmath19 originates only from avalanches : @xmath112 with @xmath113\\ ] ] the average avalanche frequency , and @xmath114 the variance of transverse displacements in a single plastic event .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that @xmath115 increases with size roughly as the lateral system size @xmath99 . using the measured frequency , we find that the variance @xmath116 decreases slowly with size : for @xmath26",
    ", we get @xmath117 .",
    "we will come back to this point later .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] shows the decomposition ( eq.([eq : corr ] ) ) for @xmath74 .",
    "it is seen that , for all @xmath40 , @xmath107 remains the dominant contribution .",
    "@xmath118 grows , then saturates .",
    "its growth range @xmath119 shows no clear size dependence .",
    "this behavior entails that plastic events are correlated over a finite @xmath40 range , which we understand as measuring a typical shear range over which the structural features involved in plastic events retain their identity .",
    "the instantaneous diffusion constant , @xmath100 for system size @xmath45 ( thick solid line ) and its decomposition into @xmath120 ( dotted line ) , @xmath106 ( dashed line ) and @xmath107 ( thin solid line ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for all sizes , @xmath121 , though much smaller than @xmath107 , exhibits an analogous behavior with a similar correlation range .",
    "this indicates that the above - mentioned persistent structures dominate the non - affine elastic response .",
    "moreover the near square - root behavior  @xcite of @xmath106 for small @xmath40 signals that the field @xmath88 in a given near - critical region is strongly correlated with the displacements associated with the subsequent avalanche .",
    "finally , @xmath120 also rises and saturates , but more slowly than @xmath106 and @xmath107 . from the data for the three system sizes , we evaluate its correlation range to be @xmath122 .",
    "that is , a single renewal , after @xmath123 , of the `` active structures '' is not sufficient for the non - affine field to fully decorrelate .",
    "this we take as a hint of the fact that active structures occupy on average a fraction only of the total system `` volume '' . with this interpretation",
    ", we evaluate this fraction as @xmath124 .",
    "two phenomenological models of plasticity of jammed disordered media  namely the stz theory of falk and langer  @xcite , and the soft glass rheology ( sgr ) of sollich et _ al _",
    "@xcite  have been proposed recently .",
    "both describe , explicitly ( stz ) or implicitly ( sgr ) , plastic events as transitions concerning small regions , modelized as either eshelby - like transformations or jumps out of traps in the energy landscape .",
    "these flips are viewed as independent , hence individual , and governed by the combined effect of external drive and of a thermal - like noise .    a question",
    "then immediately arises : are our above results consistent with the basic ingredients of these models ?",
    "we now try to answer it by careful inspection of the evolution of the spatial structure of the non - affine tangent field @xmath88 .",
    "let us first recall that @xmath88 can be written as  @xcite : @xmath125 @xmath126 where @xmath127 label particles and @xmath128 cartesian components .",
    "@xmath129 is the total energy of the lj system , and @xmath130 the associated hessian matrix .",

    "@xmath88 can be decomposed on the eigenmodes @xmath132 of @xmath130 ( the phonon modes ) . upon approaching a spinodal point , a single one , @xmath133 , softens critically  @xcite .",
    "so , in near critical regions , @xmath88 exhibits a square - root divergence and is dominated by its projection @xmath134 on @xmath133 .",
    "this property enables us to clearly characterize the active structures close to the onset of plastic events .",
    "the features we identify as characteristic of the evolution of @xmath135 are exemplified on figures 8 and 9 . in these figures , for each value of @xmath86 we decompose the total non - affine field as : @xmath136 with @xmath137 its projections on the two modes @xmath138 with lowest eigenvalues ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "we observe that , in all cases , the active structures emerge out of a quasi - random small background as one or several localized zones characterized by strong quadrupolar contributions to @xmath140 . these quadrupoles are approximately aligned with the principal directions of the homogeneous strain . as zones",

    "we have shown in section ii.2 that particle jumps @xmath158 in plastic events are well correlated with the precritical @xmath88 structure .",
    "this entails that the flip of a zone z is associated primarily with a quadrupolar displacement field of finite amplitude centered on z. this supports the representation , proposed by argon and coworkers  @xcite and explicited by picard et al  @xcite , of the elementary dissipative process as the eshelby - like shear transformation of a self generated inclusion involving a few particles , which is also the basis of the stz theory .",
    "this representation is also consistent with the main features of the distribution @xmath159 of particle displacements induced by plastic events ( see @xmath160 ii.b ) .",
    "indeed , the plot on figure  [ fig : tail ] shows that that @xmath62 becomes exponential for @xmath161 . in the eshelby picture",
    ", we expect large @xmath46 to correspond to displacements within the transforming zone(s ) , while smaller @xmath46 are associated with particles sitting in the surrounding elastic medium . in this picture",
    ", we interpret the exponential tail of @xmath63 , hence of the full distribution @xmath58 , as reflecting the diversity of intrazone structures .",
    "we thus expect that , upon varying the system size , the logarithmic slope of the tail should remain constant .",
    "as shown on figure  [ fig : tail ] , this prediction is very nicely verified for our three @xmath99 values .",
    "moreover , it appears that the tail amplitude decreases with increasing @xmath99 . in our interpretation",
    ", the statistical weight of the exponential tail is controlled by the volume fraction of zone cores involved in plastic events . since the average size of the avalanches constituting plastic events scales roughly as @xmath99 , we expect the corresponding core volume fraction to decrease with size , in agreement with the observed behavior .     the distribution @xmath159 of particle displacements induced by plastic events for @xmath101 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    so , we interpret the existence of an exponential tail in @xmath162 as a consequence of structural disorder within transforming zones , and by no means as a signature of avalanche behavior , which only affects the tail amplitude .",

    "note that , in these last two cases , they appear in the non - trivial soft mode as connected by `` flow lines '' which reproduce the most prominent vortex structures first described by tanguy et al  @xcite .",

    "@xmath167 it is the associated flow lines which form the conspicuous vortex - like patterns characteristic of non - affine fields in amorphous solids . that such patterns are akin to incompressible flows results from the fact that these systems are much more compliant in shear than in compression . for our 2d lj glass  @xcite : @xmath168 , @xmath169 .",
    "quadrupolar couplings result , in the homogeneous elastic continuum approximation for the background medium , from a stress field @xmath170 ( with @xmath171 the length and @xmath172 the orientation with respect to @xmath173 of the interzone vector ) .",
    "notice that , in figure  [ fig:1150 ] , in @xmath134 the fields of the two zones @xmath174 , @xmath175 , which are quasi vertically aligned , combine positively .",
    "we have checked that , in consistence with the above remark , zone pairs lying in sectors corresponding to negative couplings combine negatively in the phonons @xmath133 and @xmath176 : in this case , one of the two zones appears with an opposite sign , i.e. with reversed flow lines .",
    "these observations confirm the relevance of inter - zone elastic couplings .",
    "+ it is intuitively clear that configurations with strongly coupled soft zones are good candidates for simultaneous flips , as illustrated on figure  [ fig:556 ] and  [ fig:1150 ] .",
    "we observe a number of multi - zone flips , involving the disappearance of at least one diverging quadrupole , as well as that of some less visible zones .",
    "moreover , plastic events alter the amplitude of the near - critical surviving zones in @xmath140 ( see figure  [ fig:556 ] ) in a way which appears roughly consistent with quadrupolar couplings .",
    "the various pieces of information which we have gathered and presented above can now be organized into a rather detailed phenomenology of plasticity in our system in the aqs regime , which can be schematized as follows .    *",
    "( i ) * structural disorder gives rise , in such a glassy system , to the existence of strong inhomogeneities , or zones .",
    "these zones can be viewed as small inclusions  la eshelby , embedded in a quasi - homogeneous elastic background , and plastically transformable under shear .",
    "they are advected by external shear toward their instability threshold . upon approaching it",
    ", a zone softens , then flips at its spinodal and disappears .",
    "one renewal is not sufficient , however to decorrelate fully the non affine field .",
    "this suggests that zones occupy a fraction only of the system , of order @xmath178 , here @xmath179 .",
    "+ * ( ii ) * zone elastic softening and plastic flipping are both associated with quadrupolar components in the non - affine displacement field which give rise to inter - zone elastic couplings . due to the long range of elastic fields ,",
    "a zone flip thus alters the local strain level at any other zone site in the system , the resulting @xmath86-shift depending , in amplitude and sign , on the relative position of source and target .",
    "these signals have two types of effects .    ",
    "a flip signal may shift the strain level of some zones beyond their threshold @xmath89 , thus triggering their flip and initiating a cascade . in the qs regime , where acoustic delays are neglected ,",
    "such cascades are instantaneous .",
    " for the non - flipping zones , the elastic signals resulting from flips constitute a dynamical noise , acting in parallel with the externally imposed advection , whose frequency scale is proportional to the strain rate @xmath6 .",
    "so , in agreement with the previous proposition of bulatov and argon  @xcite , also underlying recent models by picard et al  @xcite and by baret et al  @xcite , we conclude that elastic couplings between zones play an essential role , by inducing avalanches and generating the dominant contribution to the disorder - induced noise . at @xmath180 and moderate strain rates ,",
    "it is this dynamical elastic noise which , in addition to strain advection , must appear in models of plasticity of jammed media . in a forthcoming article",
    ", we will propose such a schematic model , and show that it accounts for a system - size scaling behavior of avalanches . + within the foregoing picture , we interpret the two kind of events invoked by tanguy et al  @xcite as plastic events of different sizes .",
    "namely , their transient shear bands exhibit the characteristics expected for large avalanches of the type described above , their directionality resulting from that of quadrupolar couplings in their system with two rigid walls .",
    "their local events correspond to the small stress drops appearing during initial transients ( see figure  [ fig : stressstrain ] ) : at low stress levels , before advection has been able to significantly feed the near - threshold population , we indeed understand that avalanche triggering is unlikely , hence that single flip events are the rule .",
    "+ let us finally stress that the above zone phenomenology remains very schematic .",
    "indeed , exhaustive inspection of the evolution of @xmath140 reveals that zone life is somewhat more eventful than our simplified description suggests .",
    "rather frequently , we see a given zone undergoing a few flips before it disappears .",
    "such zones can be termed multi - state . in other instances ,",
    "a barely visible zone emerges fast enough to `` overtake '' previously more visible , softer , ones .",
    "that is , zone moduli and , very likely , thresholds are not unique , but distributed about an average .",
    "these remarks point toward the interest of pursuing extensive characterization of elastic heterogeneity in jammed systems , in particular via studies of coarse grained elastic moduli .",
    "+ on a more speculative level , we would like to raise an important question : are the irreversible transformations identified here under shear related to the dynamic heterogeneities  @xcite characteristic of glassy dynamics near and below @xmath181 ?",
    "indeed , we share the opinion , formulated long ago by goldstein  @xcite , that at finite temperature `` rearrangements are of course occurring all the time in the absence of an external stress ; the external stress , by biasing them , reveals their existence '' .",
    "our active zones are primarily sensitive to shear .",
    "this , we think , must be put together with recent results by widmer - cooper and harrowell  @xcite .",
    "these authors show that dynamic propensity in a 2d lj glass is uncorrelated with free volume , which we understand to mean that their local rearranging structures are only wekly coupled to compression .",
    "this leads us to suggest that their observation that zones of high propensity have large `` debye - waller factors '' amounts to identifying them as soft zones sensitive to shear  a speculation which will demand extensive future investigation .                                  strictly speaking , in order to observe the asymptotic @xmath183 behavior",
