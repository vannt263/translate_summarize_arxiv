    "accretion onto a black hole is a fundamental astrophysical process capable of producing copious amounts of energy from radio  @xmath7-ray frequencies .",

    "this is illustrated by the discovery of large jet blown cavities around stellar mass black holes @xcite . when integrated over the lifetime of the black hole",
    ", this energy will have a significant impact on its environment , e.g. , feedback from supermassive black holes ( smbh ) in the quiescent state ( @xmath8 ) ] is required to reproduce the observed properties of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the observation of tight correlations between the smbh and properties of the host galaxy are further evidence for the importance of feedback from the black hole , and understanding this will provide insight into the process of galaxy formation and evolution @xcite . at higher redshifts still",
    ", the accretion power of early hmxbs could have an impact on the formation of the earliest stars and galaxies @xcite .",
    "there are over 500 accreting binaries currently known in the milky way , though this sample is dominated by systems containing neutron star accretors .",
    "observations of other galaxies have also revealed large populations of accreting objects @xcite , which can be used to reveal information on the star formation history @xcite and stellar content of these galaxies @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity function of the milky way can be used to constrain the population and evolution of x - ray emitting sources in the galaxy @xcite , which is found to be dominated by accreting binary systems with compact object accretors ( bh , ns & wd , @xcite ) .",
    "detailed study of the accretion flow in galactic x - ray binaries can provide constraints on the nature of accretion in the presence of a large gravitational potential , and the theory of general relativity itself @xcite .",
    "in particular , they provide a nearby window on black hole spin @xcite , the production mechanism of the ubiquitous relativistic jet emission @xcite , and even the nature of supernovae ( sne ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; @xcite ) . to date ,",
    "there are 20 confirmed stellar mass black holes ( i.e. , with dynamical constraints on the mass of the bh ) and greater than 20 strong candidate systems , e.g. , see @xcite .    bh x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) are typically transient systems that are observed to brighten from @xmath9 on timescales of weeks to months before returning to a low luminosity state .",
    "the galactic black hole binaries have been classified based on their behavior in the soft x - ray band ( 0.1  10 kev ) .",
    "this resulted in the definition of a number of apparently discrete spectral states @xcite .",
    "when a black hole is accreting at an appreciable percentage of its eddington luminosity ( @xmath10 ) , 2 primary spectral forms are observed .",
    "the first of these is the low - hard state , characterized by a power - law continuum in the 2  10 kev band with a spectral index @xmath11 , and a spectral cut - off at energies @xmath1 100 kev .",
    "the rms spectral variability is observed to be high in this state .",
    "the second state is the so - called high - soft state .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is dominated by emission in the soft band ( @xmath12 ) consistent with a thermal blackbody component , a softer low luminosity power - law component at higher energies ( @xmath13 ) , and low rms noise @xcite .",
    "the launch of the _ rxte _ mission @xcite resulted in a refinement in our understanding of these spectral states , and the transitions between them , which have resulted in the definition of a number of intermediate spectral states based on both the spectral state and the timing properties of the source @xcite .",
    "the broadband emission from accreting black holes is correlated with the behavior at x - ray wavelengths , as clearly illustrated by the observed phenomenology of the radio jet @xcite .",
    "studies of jets from accreting black holes on all mass scales have led to the realization that the accretion disk ( inflow ) and the jet ( outflow ) are closely related , i.e. , ` fundamental plane of black hole activity ' @xcite and ` disk - jet coupling ' @xcite . in particular it has been noted that ( i ) the low - hard state ( @xmath14 ) is typically associated with the presence of a compact quasi - steady jet ( ii ) radio / jet emission appears to cease when the system enters the high - soft state ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this suggests that the accretion disk inflow is intimately involved in the process of launching a jet , e.g. , @xcite .    at higher energies ( @xmath16 ) , the large archive of high energy observations by _ rxte _",
    "@xcite , observations by _ integral _ through the bulge monitoring program @xcite , and pointed observations are helping to elucidate the nature of the high energy x - ray component .",
    "_ suzaku _ observations have demonstrated the importance of having broadband spectral coverage , where the broad bandpass ( 0.6  300 kev ) has proven to be crucial to simultaneously constrain the soft accretion disk component , the hard x - ray emission and the reflection features , i.e. , fe k line , compton hump e.g. , see @xcite for high energy spectra and @xcite for constraints on the reflection component .",
    "70% of the observations having an exposure time less than 2 ks and 90% less than 4 ks .",
    "the total exposure time is 940 ks .",
    "the hatched histogram shows the total number of counts for the spectra in our sample ( see x2 axis ) .",
    "the peak is at @xmath1 60k counts , while 70% and 90% of the spectra had greater than 3.5k and 500 total counts respectively .",
    "the number of counts in the background relative to the source is negligible in all cases . ]",
    "understanding the relationship between the accretion disk inflow and the jet outflow is one of the outstanding goals of modern astrophysics .",
    "the anti - correlation between the accretion state of the black hole and the presence or absence of a relativistic jet indicates that understanding the geometry of the accretion flow in each of the primary accretion states will be key , i.e. , the low - hard state and the high - soft state .",
    "the current paradigm for the configuration of these accretion states is consistent with a hot geometrically thin optically thick multi - temperature blackbody accretion disk @xcite extending to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) in the soft state . as the accretion rate and hence disk temperature drop ,",
    "the inner edge of the accretion disk recedes from the isco and the inner region is filled with a geometrically thick adaf ( advection dominated accretion flow , @xcite ) , which produces the observed hard spectral component that dominates the low - hard state x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , a number of recent observations contradict this picture and reveal evidence for the persistent of the accretion disk at the isco in the low - hard state , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the accretion disk is not the primary driver of the observed low - hard @xmath17 high - soft state transition .",
    "indeed , the latest observations suggest that the disk does not recede from the isco until luminosities of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "a number of alternative scenarios are consistent with the accretion disk remaining at the isco , e.g. , the hard x - ray flux may originate in the relativistic jet @xcite or from a hot corona @xcite , and it is the turning on / off of the jet or evolution of the corona that drives the observed state transitions .    questions also persist at longer wavelengths .",
    "recent observations have highlighted a problem in our understanding of the uv emission mechanism in x - ray binaries .",
    "standard theory explains the uv emission as direct emission from the accretion disk and observations of the classical @xmath19 spectrum in early iue observations supported this picture @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized that the large flux of x - rays present in an x - ray binary should modify the standard disk spectrum , with the x - ray emission irradiating the disk , where it is subsequently reprocessed  disk reprocessing ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a standard steady state accretion disk will be observed to exhibit a radial temperature dependence of the form @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it is inherently difficult to constrain the temperature profile of the accretion disk at x - ray wavelengths as the primary modification to the accretion disk spectrum occurs at wavelengths to the red of the typical x - ray detector , i.e. , uv / optical or @xmath21 .",
    "this is illustrated in @xcite who studied a sample of _ asca _ observations of black holes in outburst and found the temperature profile of the measured spectra to be consistent with the standard @xmath22 accretion disk at all times , though there was evidence , of low statistical significance , for a deviation towards a more irradiated disk in some of the observations .",
    "in contrast , observations at optical and uv wavelengths have revealed clear signatures for disk irradiation @xcite .",
    "indeed , the addition of x - ray irradiation of the accretion disk to the disk instability model is required in order to reproduce the observed outburst lightcurves of black holes xrbs @xcite .    over the last decade",
    "the picture has been further complicated by the realization that the radio jet may contribute significantly across the entire spectral energy distribution , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "furthermore , simultaneous observations at optical and x - ray wavelengths have revealed complex correlation functions , hinting at the presence of a non - thermal component in addition to the accretion disk emission , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "@xcite has recently carried out a comprehensive study of black hole x - ray binaries using over 13 years of archival _ rxte _ observations . in @xcite ,",
    "hardness intensity ( hid ) and disk fraction luminosity diagrams ( dfld ) were constructed for 25 black holes .",
    "@xcite focused on the behavior of the accretion disk component in each of the outbursts studied in the previous paper .",
    "in particular , they analyzed the observed distribution of temperature versus luminosity for each outburst and found it to be consistent with @xmath23 , and with previous studies , which found the inner radius of the accretion disk to be constant in disk dominated states .",
    "they do note a deviation from this relation at the entry to / exit from the disk dominated state , which they suggest is consistent with a varying color correction factor ( e.g. , @xcite , see  [ accretion_disk]iii for further details ) .",
    "however , due to the 3 kev lower energy limit of _ rxte _ , this study was necessarily restricted to relatively hot accretion disks ( @xmath24 ) .    despite the significant progress made over recent years ,",
    "a number of unanswered questions remain . in this study , we focus our attention on the following issues :    a.   does the accretion disk recede from the isco during the soft to hard state transition ?",
    "b.   what is the nature of the accretion geometry in the low hard state , i.e. , is the accretion disk truncated ?",
    "what is the source of the observed hard x - ray flux , a jet or a corona ?",
    "c.   what produces the uv emission ,",
    "does it originate from the accretion disk or is there a non - thermal contribution ?",
    "the _ swift _ observatory was designed to discover and provide rapid multi - wavelength follow - up of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "these same attributes allow detailed study of many other time variable phenomena , in particular accreting stellar mass black holes . due to the rapid pointing capability and",
    "low pointing overhead _ swift _ provides the first detailed ccd resolution monitoring of black hole binaries in outburst . combined with the strictly simultaneous observations at optical / uv wavelengths provided by uvot ,",
    "_ swift _ is the ideal platform to study the accretion process in detail . in comparison to _ rxte _ , the low energy x - ray cutoff allows us to study the accretion disk across the entire outburst cycle , whereas previously the cool disk would have been outside the rxte low energy cutoff ( @xmath1 3 kev ) .    in this paper",
    ", we describe observations of black hole binaries undertaken with the _ swift _ observatory prior to june 2010 . in  2 , we describe the observations and extraction of source spectra and lightcurves .",
    "we proceed to analyze the data in  3 and the results are presented in  4 . in particular , we find that there is no evidence for significant truncation of the accretion disk , at least to luminosities @xmath25 . in the broadband data , we find evidence for an irradiated accretion disk at all luminosities probed , but increasing as we enter the low - hard state .",
    "these results are discussed in the context of models for the accretion flow in  5 , and finally our conclusions are presented in  6 .",
    "our data sample consists of _ swift _ observations of all known and suspected stellar mass black hole candidates observed through august 2010 ( see table [ bhc_table ] ) .",
    "data for each system was obtained via the _ heasarc _ archive service .",
    "the _ swift _ observatory @xcite is a highly versatile multi - wavelength platform , providing rapid pointing capabilities and simultaneous broad wavelength coverage from optical to hard x - ray energies .",
    "the _ swift _ observatory contains three instruments :    _ ( i ) burst alert telescope ( bat , @xcite ) : _ a coded mask hard x - ray ( @xmath16 ) imaging telescope , covering the energy band from 15  150 kev .",
    "low resolution spectra are also provided at higher fluxes .    _",
    "( ii ) x - ray telescope ( xrt , @xcite ) : _ a 3.5 m focal length wolter i type grazing incidence x - ray telescope , containing a 600 pix@xmath26 ccd ( @xmath1 2.35@xmath27 pix@xmath28 , i.e. , 23 arcmin@xmath26 ) , sensitive over the energy range 0.2  10 kev at the telescope focus , with an effective area of @xmath1 135 , 65 , 20 @xmath29 at 1.5 , 6.4 and 8 kev respectively .",
    "bright sources are typically problematic to observe with ccd based detectors ( see  [ pile_up ] ) .",
    "the xrt uses a number of different read - out modes to avoid / mitigate this problem , facilitating observations of sources with fluxes in excess of @xmath1 1 crab ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "these may be divided into windowed timing ( wt ) and photon counting modes . in windowed timing mode",
    "only spectral information is provided as the central 8 arc - minutes of the ccd is collapsed into a single spatial direction , providing 1.8 ms timing resolution .",
    "this is the primary mode used at high fluxes , with the observations presented herein primarily utilizing wtw2 mode .",
    "photon counting mode ( pc ) is the standard method of reading out a ccd providing both spectral and 2 dimensional spatial information but with a limited time resolution of only 2.5 s. the majority of photon counting mode observations herein are in pcw2 mode .    _ ( iii ) ultra - violet / optical telescope ( uvot , @xcite ) : _ simultaneous observations are obtained at optical / uv energies with the uvot instrument ( 30 cm ritchie chretien telescope ) . the detector is a complex system consisting of a photodiode , micro - channel plates and a ccd ( see the instrument paper for details ) .",
    "the ccd provides a 17 arcmin@xmath26 fov and a frame time of 10.8 ms .",
    "coincidence loss occurs at high count rates , typically those in excess of 20 ct s@xmath28 , but this is not an issue for the optical / uv counterparts to the black hole binaries in our sample .",
    "observations are normally obtained in only an single filter ; however , there are some sources with multi - wavelength lightcurves .",
    "the systems in our sample contain data in one or more of the 6 uvot photometric filters v , b , u , w1 , m2 , w2 ( @xmath31 5468  , 4392  , 3465  , 2600  , 2246  , 1928  ) .",

    "these range from those systems with dynamical constraints on the mass of the compact object , i.e. , @xmath33 ( e.g. , cyg x-1 , gro j1655 - 40 ) , to a large number of systems that are more correctly labeled as candidate black holes",
    ". these are systems that have displayed spectral / photometric attributes consistent with those of the known black hole systems , e.g. , soft spectrum , timing properties , lack of pulsations or x - ray bursts , but lack a dynamical constraint on the mass of the compact object , e.g. , 4u 1957 + 11 , swift j1753.5 - 0127 .",
    "the results presented herein are necessarily biased by those objects with the majority of observations , i.e. , cyg x-1 , gx 339 - 4 , xte j1817 - 330 , xte j1752 - 223 and swift j1753.5 - 0127 .",
    "however , these object are distributed relatively uniformly over the relevant binary parameters , e.g. , hmxb vs lmxb , @xmath34 etc . , and",

    "the known system parameters for each of the black hole binaries in our sample are listed in table [ bhc_table ] .",
    "a typical _ swift _ pointing is short with an exposure time less than 2 ks .",
    "for the purposes of this study , we ignore all pointings for which the total number of counts detected by the xrt is less than 100 .",
    "thus our sample consists of the following :    * 476 observations of 27 bhs with @xmath35 100 counts in the 0.6  10 kev band . * 255 observations for which we have simultaneous detections at optical / uv wavelengths , in at least one band ( v , b , u , w1 , w2 , m2 ) .",

    "[ bh_all_systems ] , we plot the absorbed flux vs time for all of the systems in our sample .",
    "we are sensitive to fluxes over a dynamic range of @xmath37 .",
    "we aim to use the data sample described herein ( see  [ sample_characteristics ] ) to probe the physics of accretion onto black holes . to begin , we outline the steps taken to extract the final spectral and photometric data products .",
    "all data reduction and analysis was performed using the heasoft 6.9 suite , which includes ftools 6.9 , swift 3.5 and xspec 12.6.0k .",
    "the latest versions of the relevant _ swift _ caldb files are also used .",
    "data were downloaded from the heasarc archive using the coordinates listed in table [ bhc_table ] , where the search radius was restricted to 10@xmath38 .",
    "all raw - data were reprocessed using the ` xrtpipeline ` to ensure usage of the latest _ swift _ caldb when producing the relevant observation event files .",
    "spectra were then extracted using ` xselect ` from circular and annular regions in the photon counting mode data , while rectangular regions were used to extract spectra from the windowed timing mode data .",
    "exposure maps were generated for each observation using the ` xrtexpomap ` task .",
    "these are particularly important due to the presence of a number of dead columns near the center of the xrt ccd due to a likely micro - meteorite impact in may 2005 @xcite .",
    "background spectra were subsequently extracted from neighbouring regions .",
    "ancillary response function files ( .arf ) were created with the ` xrtmkarf ` task , while the appropriate response matrix ( .rmf ) was sourced from the calibration database .",
    "these files were then grouped together with ` grppha ` and exported to xspec for spectral fitting .     for our best fit ` pha(diskbb+po ) ` model .",
    "the dashed histogram is the model containing the power - law component alone , while the blue histogram denotes the best fit model after the addition of the ` diskbb ` component .",
    "an accretion disk is required at greater than the 5@xmath0 confidence level in @xmath32 61% of the observations .",
    "fits with alternative continuum components reveal similar results , see table [ chi2_table ] . ]",
    "due to the photon counting nature of modern x - ray ccds , they are strongly susceptible to a phenomenon known as ` pile - up ' .",
    "this occurs at high fluxes , where multiple photons can impact a detector pixel at approximately the same time ( i.e. , less than the detector frame time ) , and be recorded as a single higher energy event .",
    "this will produce an excess of hard photons in the measured spectrum , which as a result will appear harder than is actually the case .",
    "proper interpretation of the observed spectra requires a strategy to mitigate the adverse pile - up related effects . for further details",
    "see @xcite for a detailed discussion of pile - up in x - ray ccds , including _",
    "chandra , xmm - newton and suzaku _ in addition to the _ swift _ xrt .    in our analysis , pile - up",
    "is corrected in the standard manner , i.e. , by the extraction of annular regions centered on the source position .",
    "the excluded region radius was chosen to be conservative and agrees with those used by other groups , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the exclusion regions utilized are listed in table [ pile_up_table ] along with the corresponding count rates . in order to confirm the effectiveness of this strategy",
    ", we ensured that the chosen exclusion radius was such that the best fit spectral parameters did not exhibit significant variance in comparison to the next largest exclusion region .",
    "the sample we present here is dominated by observations of black holes in the spectrally hard state , which typically results in lower observed fluxes in comparison to the soft state . in total , approximately 20% of our spectra are effected by pile - up of some form when classified using the count rates in table [ pile_up_table ] .",
    "the majority of this occurs at the lower count rate levels , e.g. , only 2.5% & 4.5% of our observations required the largest and second largest exclusion regions respectively .",
    "the final spectra that we choose to analyze are those where the quantity of interest is robustly on the conservative side , for example , @xcite exclude only the inner pixel for count rates in the range 100  300 @xmath39 and 2 pixels for 300  400 @xmath40 and 4 pixels for counts rates @xmath41 .",
    "the optical & uv photometry required minimal additional processing @xcite .",
    "we begin by utilizing the level ii pipeline processed image file ( sk.img ) .",
    "images are aspect corrected via the ` uvotskycorr ` tool , where the images are registered to the usno - b1 catalogue @xcite . source flux is extracted from an aperture of 5@xmath27 radius and the background is extracted from a neighbouring source free sky position .",
    "the counterparts to the x - ray sources are easily identified , primarily due to the transient nature of the optical / uv counterpart in combination with the accurate x - ray position provided by the xrt .",
    "this also allows us to detect any contamination from possible line of sight stars contributing to the 5@xmath27 source aperture .",
    "source flux and magnitudes are calculated using ` uvotmaghist ` tool .",
    "these fluxes are converted to xspec readable ` .pha ' files with ` uvot2pha ` , which are then exported for spectral fitting .",
    "the are a large number of models available in xspec for modelling the x - ray emission from black hole binary systems .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , the standard model for black hole x - ray binaries involves the combination of soft emission ( @xmath42 2 kev ) from a thermal accretion disk and hard x - ray ( @xmath32 2 kev ) emission from power - law like component , typically attributed to compton scattering of the thermal photons from the accretion disk to higher energies @xcite , or perhaps emission from a jet @xcite . in an effort to model the data in a manner that minimizes bias , we choose two complimentary approaches :    \\(i ) phenomenological  here we aim to determine the empirical relationships displayed in the data , which can be used to inform / constrain theoretical models and characterise source types .",
    "for example , is the system spectrally hard or soft ?",
    "a very soft x - ray spectrum is one of the characteristic signatures of an accreting black hole in the soft state .",
    "additionally , we can create color - color and hardness intensity diagrams to search for characteristic variability and search for correlation at other frequencies , i.e. , optical / uv .",
    "\\(ii ) physical  using these models we will attempt to constrain the intrinsic properties of the accretion flow , e.g. , accretion disk temperature and inner radius . for the soft component , we assume a standard steady state , geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk @xcite , described by the ` diskbb ` model @xcite .",
    "extensions to this base model are also considered , e.g. , corrections for gr effects in the inner disk region close to the black hole ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or via the ` diskpn ` model @xcite ) and accounting for possible changes in the temperature profile of the disk due to , for example , irradiation by the corona or flux generated otherwise close to the black hole ( ` diskpbb ` , @xcite ) .",
    "these models have the advantage of simplicity while incorporating the important physics , and a large archive of published observations with which the resulted presented herein may be readily compared .",
    "detailed state of the art models of accretion disks have been developed , e.g. , ` bhspec ` @xcite and ` kerrbb ` @xcite ; however , systematic uncertainties remain ( e.g. , @xcite ) and a detailed investigation of these issues is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the hard x - ray component , i.e. , that which typically dominates above @xmath1 2 kev , is modelled using 2 distinct prescriptions . the most basic model for the hard x - ray flux is a simple power - law , characterized by a spectral index , @xmath43 .",
    "while this model offers the simplest method to characterize the hard x - ray flux , at low energy it does not exhibit a cut - off as one would expect if the hard x - rays are generated via compton scattering of the soft x - ray photons from the accretion disk .",
    "this is an important issue in the current analysis due to the sensitivity of the _ swift_/xrt to energies as low as 0.5 kev . in this case",
    ", the hard component may be modelled assuming it originates via scattering of the low temperature seed photons from the accretion disk by a high temperature corona .",
    "detailed comptonization models including reflection ` compps ` @xcite and non - thermal electron contributions ` eqpair ` @xcite are available ; however , given the upper energy bound of the xrt ( 10 kev ) , we choose to use the most computationally efficient thermal comptonization model ( ` comptt ` , @xcite ) . in the interest of completeness , we also consider the ` simpl ` comptonization model of @xcite .",
    "this model differs from the ` comptt ` model in that it allows one to specifically choose the input model for the seed photons , whereas the seed photons are assumed to originate from the wein tail of a blackbody in the ` comptt ` case . where simultaneous uvot / xrt data are available , joint fits are undertaken in an effort to constrain the nature of the broadband x - ray to opt / uv spectrum .",
    "the extinction in this case is modelled using the xspec ` phabs ` & ` redden ` models for the x - ray and opt / uv data respectively .",
    "the standard galactic extinction curve was assumed @xcite along with the gas to dust ratio from @xcite , i.e. , the reddening was set to @xmath44 .",
    "we note that in sightlines towards the galactic center the column density is highly variable and as such the standard extinction curve may not be appropriate for all sources in our sample .",
    "are assumed .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity is consistent with a normal distribution peaking at @xmath1 1% eddington . ]      for our baseline model , we utilize a blackbody accretion disk in addition to a power - law to model the x - ray spectrum ( i.e. , ` diskbb+po ` ) .",
    "this model will also aid in the comparison of our results to the significant archive of _ rxte _ observations , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "to model the absorption by intervening neutral hydrogen , we use ` phabs ` , where throughout this paper the abundances and cross - sections assumed are ` bcmc ` @xcite and ` angr ` @xcite respectively .",
    "the column density is held fixed at a value consistent with previous observations , see table [ bhc_table ] for details .",
    "this is in agreement with the observed absence of significant local absorption in these systems @xcite , with obvious exceptions for the case of the wind - accreting hmxbs .",
    "spectra with less than 100 total counts were ignored in all further spectral fitting .",
    "such spectra are typically those obtained with the xrt operating in auto - mode , i.e. , the first observation takes place in windowed timing mode and if the count rate is safe the observation is stopped and switched to photon counting mode , sometimes resulting in an under - exposed or piled - up spectrum . the best fit statistic is chosen based on the total number of counts in the spectrum .",
    "standard chi - squared fitting is used for observations with more than 500 counts .",
    "all spectra with sufficient counts to meet our @xmath45 fitting criteria were binned so as to have a minimum of 20 counts in each bin via the ` grppha ` task thus ensuring that use of this statistic is valid .",

    "fundamentally , we are unable to differentiate between these 2 physical scenarios with the available data , though appealing to previous timing observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) leads us to favor the power - law model .",
    "in addition , correlated multi - wavelength studies ( radio  x - ray ) have revealed clear evidence for a jet in the hard state @xcite ; however , these studies suggest that it is unlikely to contribute significantly at uv wavelengths , consistent with the analysis herein .",
    "the soft state spectra appear to rule out a power - law origin for the observed hard x - ray component as this results in a much harder spectral index than is normally measured in the soft state .",
    "this is in agreement with the well known behavior of relativistic jets , whereby they are observed to be present in the hard state , but appear to be absent in the soft state @xcite .    in light of these results , it may be necessary to re - consider the effect of the assumed temperature profile on the measured black hole spin , as even though the x - ray spectrum may be consistent with a standard steady state disk , when one considers the broadband spectrum deviations from this profile become apparent .",
    "this may materially impact the derived disk parameters .",
    "for example , a single observation of the black hole binary 4u 1957 + 11 is included in this study .",
    "when the broadband data is fit with the variable temperature profile disk model , the best fit temperature profile is consistent with an irradiated accretion disk with a lower disk temperature in comparison to the steady state case .",

    "for the comptonization model the optical depth is observed to behave in the opposite sense to the power - law spectral index .",
    "we remind the reader that we have fixed the electron temperature to be 50 kev due to the lack of data above 10 kev . even though cyg x-1 is a hmxb with a massive o - type donor , in contrast to the the low mass main sequence stars typically detected in the transient black hole binaries , the basic x - ray continuum behavior described above",
    "is also observed from the persistent lmxb swift j1753.5 - 0127 .",
    "this suggests that the behavior we observe is driven by the inner accretion flow and not by the nature of the mass transfer , i.e. , wind vs roche lobe overflow .",
    "in contrast to the persistent systems , the transients as represented by gx 339 - 4 display discrete changes in measured disk temperature , consistent with the well known transitions between the low temperature hard state and the high temperature soft state , after brightening from the quiescent state @xcite . since the launch of the _ swift _ mission there have been 4 outbursts detected from gx 339 - 4 ( fig . [ disk_properties ]  right ) .",
    "two of these outbursts are consistent with the system remaining in the hard - state for the duration of the outburst . in fact , a statistically significant ( 5@xmath0 ) accretion disk component was not detected during the second outburst .",
    "such hard - state outbursts have been detected from numerous black hole systems , e.g. , gro j0422 + 32 , xte j1118 + 480 , gs 1354 - 64 among others @xcite .",
    "the other two outbursts are observed to show a clear transition to the accretion disk dominated soft - state .",
    "here , we see that the normalization ( color radius ) of the accretion disk increases as the disk temperature decreases , though this effect essentially disappears when the hard component is modelled using the comptonization model .",
    "the power - law index is observed to decrease in concert with the decreasing disk temperature , while again the optical depth behaves in the opposite sense , i.e. , @xmath53 increases as the disk temperature decreases .",
    "finally , we note that this change in the disk temperature and any related changes in the structure / geometry of the accretion flow takes place on timescales of days ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "[ disk_properties ] ) , consistent with evolution of the inner accretion disk on the viscous timescale .",
    "the analysis presented in the preceding sections is dependent on a number of assumptions regarding the properties of the individual x - ray binary systems , see table [ bhc_table ] . in particular , the inner radius of the accretion disk depends on the line of sight column density and the assumed distance and inclination of the source ( @xmath160 , see  [ accretion_disk ] ) .",
    "likewise , the broadband spectral fitting ( see  [ bband_spec ] ) will be sensitive to the column density as it is the data at optical and uv wavelengths that provides the constraints on deviations of the accretion disk temperature profile from that expected for a steady state disk .",

    "@xmath161 : _ + there are a number of different issues regarding the column density , which affect different areas of the paper .",
    "the assumed value of the column density will effect the low energy region of the x - ray spectrum , and hence the normalization of the measured accretion disk component .",
    "the assumed abundance model will alter the magnitude of flux absorbed by the intervening gas for a given column density . a different gas / dust ratio will effect the disk temperature profile for the joint x - ray / uv fits .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated , via _ chandra _ ccd grating observations of a sample of black hole binaries , that the column density is consistent with remaining constant for those binary systems dominated by disk accretion .",
    "this is in contrast to the hmxbs ( e.g. , cyg x-1 , lmc x-1 ) , where a large stellar wind may be present .",
    "we emphasise here that the winds detected from accretion disks during certain stages of an xrb outburst @xcite are different to the absorbing line of sight column , i.e. , density / temperature , making it possible to separate the local / non - local absorption component .",
    "the column density is held fixed at a value consistent with previous observations , see table [ bhc_table ] for details .",
    "this is in agreement with the observed absence of significant local absorption in these systems @xcite , with obvious exceptions for the case of the wind - accreting hmxbs .",
    "care must also be taken with the chosen abundance model , for example , the metal abundances in the latest solar model differs from the @xcite abundances used in the absorption model herein ( ` phabs ` ) .",
    "updated models reflecting our improved knowledge of the solar abundance contain lower metal abundances , which imply decreased absorption for a constant column density , i.e. , inferring larger disk components via the extra soft excess .",
    "such models are available in xspec for usage with the ` phabs ` model via the  wilms \" or  aspl \" abundance models @xcite .",
    "we have repeated the x - ray fits assuming the  aspl \" abundances and find that while the measured disk properties may change during individual observations at the 5% ",

    "the accretion disk contribution to the optical / uv portion of the spectrum is especially susceptible to the chosen gas to dust ratio . throughout the broadband fitting a value of @xmath162 was assumed to link the optical / uv ( ` redden ` ) to the x - ray ( ` phabs ` ) absorption @xcite . however , different values have been measured previously e.g. , @xmath163 @xcite , @xmath164 @xcite .",

    "however , the mass of the black hole is only important in those plots where luminosities are plotted in eddington units .",
    "the measured accretion disk properties are independent of mass , at least as characterized by the models used herein .",
    "the distances to the majority of these systems are unknown , and are instead estimates based on a number of factors ( e.g. , the observed column density , observed outburst flux , magnitude of the optical counterpart in outburst / quiescence ) , and comparison with those systems whose properties have been constrained via detailed observations , see table [ bhc_table ] .",
    "the distance enters the inner radius calculation as a linear factor and it is highly unlikely that any of the distances are over / under estimated by a factor of @xmath1 2 .",

    "this amounts to a factor of 1.7 for an inclination of 70@xmath168 . to date , no eclipses have been observed from any of these systems indicating that typical inclinations are less than 70@xmath168 .",
    "for more typical inclinations of 30@xmath168  60@xmath168 ( see @xcite ) , the inclination will increase the inner radius by between 7%  40% percent .",

    "as can be seen in the figure , there is a clear difference between the model with the steady state accretion disk where the optical emission is dominated by the power - law component and those models with an irradiated disk , where the optical emission is dominated by the disk component .",
    "however , the power - law index is poorly constrained by the x - ray data , which is dominated by the disk emission .",
    "both of the variable temperature profile models return non - standard profiles , i.e. , @xmath172 ; however , the standard disk model provides a statistically comparable fit to the data .",
    "we must now consider the returned parameters and their implications .",
    "in particular , we note that both of the models that utilize a power - law to generate the hard x - ray emission , return hard photon indices ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "such hard power - law emission is in conflict with the well known soft power - laws normally observed in the soft disk dominated states , i.e. , @xmath13 @xcite .",

    "<S> the broad _ swift _ bandpass enables a trace of disk evolution over an unprecedented range in flux and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the final data sample consists of 476 x - ray spectra containing greater than 100 counts , in the 0.6  10 kev band . </S>",
    "<S> this is the largest sample of high quality ccd spectra of accreting black holes published to date . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , strictly simultaneous data at optical / uv wavelengths are available for 255 ( 54% ) of these observations . </S>",
    "<S> the data are modelled with a combination of an accretion disk and a hard spectral component . </S>",
    "<S> for the hard component we consider both a simple power - law and a thermal comptonization model . </S>",
    "<S> an accretion disk is detected at greater than the 5@xmath0 confidence level in 61% of the observations . </S>",

    "<S> swift_. the observed spectra have an average luminosity of @xmath1 1% eddington , though we are sensitive to accretion disks down to a luminosity of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this is also the largest sample of such cool accretion disks studied to date . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion disk temperature distribution displays two peaks consistent with the classical hard and soft spectral states , with a smaller number of disks distributed between these . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of inner disk radii is observed to be continuous regardless of which model is used to fit the hard continua . </S>",
    "<S> there is no evidence for large scale truncation of the accretion disk in the hard state ( @xmath3 ) , with all of the accretion disks having radii @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> plots of the accretion disk inner radius versus hardness ratio reveal the disk radius to be decreasing as the spectrum hardens , i.e. , enters the hard state . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to expectations from the standard disk truncation paradigm and points towards a contribution from spectral hardening . </S>",
    "<S> the availability of simultaneous x - ray and optical / uv data for a subset of observations , facilitates a critical examination of the role of disk irradiation via a modified disk model with a variable emissivity profile ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the broadband spectra ( x - ray  </S>",
    "<S> opt / uv ) reveal irradiation of the accretion disk to be an important effect at all luminosities sampled herein , i.e. , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion disk is found to dominate the uv emission irrespective of the assumed hard spectral component . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we find the broadband soft state spectra to be consistent with an irradiated accretion disk plus a corona , but we are unable to make conclusive statements regarding the nature of the hard state accretion flow ( e.g. , adaf / corona vs jet ) . finally , the _ swift _ data reveal a relation between the flux emitted by the accretion disk and that emitted by the corona , for this sample of stellar mass black holes , that is found to be in broad agreement with the observed disk  </S>",
