    "the phenomenon of perturbative saturation has been the focus of intensive study in recent years . since the appearance of the first rhic data , saturation based ideas have motivated several attempts at understanding bulk properties of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions such as the multiplicity , rapidity distribution and centrality dependence of particle production  @xcite . in particular the recent work",
    "@xcite suggests that the saturating properties of the nuclear gluon distribution may be responsible for the @xmath8 scaling of charged particle multiplicity at @xmath9 gev with centrality in rhic data .",
    "it is undoubtedly true that saturation effects suppress the number of gluons below the saturation momentum @xmath10 in the nuclear wave function .",
    "it is then very plausible that the number of produced particles at @xmath11 is also suppressed relative to simple perturbative prediction .",
    "the value of @xmath12 is estimated to be of order @xmath13 gev@xmath5 for most central collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the suggestion of  @xcite goes beyond this simple statement and implies that the suppression persists also at higher momenta , namely in the so called scaling window @xmath14 .    on the other hand one expects a competing effect of transverse momentum broadening due to multiple rescatterings in the final state , the so called cronin effect .",
    "this should enhance the number of particles produced in the intermediate momentum range and thus works against the saturation argument .",
    "the purpose of this note is to show that there is no outright contradiction between the appearance of the cronin effect and the expectations based on the saturation scenario and that , in fact , the cronin enhancement is inherent in some realizations of saturation physics .",
    "we show here that saturation models based on multiple rescattering lead to the relation @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "this relation leads to cronin enhancement when comparing gluon production in central and peripheral collisions .    for saturation models based not on multiple rescattering but rather on coherent suppression at low @xmath17",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "here it is also true that the number of gluons produced in the intermediate momentum range is greater than the prediction of the leading order perturbation theory .",
    "this overall enhancement is the result of the increase of the number of gluons in the nuclear wave function due to low @xmath17 evolution .",
    "the transverse momentum broadening is also present .",
    "this is manifested by the anomalous dimension generated by the low @xmath17 evolution , so that the decrease of the evolved distribution with momentum is very slow . however , whether this broadening results in the cronin enhancement is determined by the behavior of saturated gluon distribution at high transverse momenta .",
    "the momenta which are important are those above the scaling window inside which the value of the anomalous dimension is analytically understood . if the distribution above the scaling window approaches quickly the leading order perturbative one , the cronin effect is indeed generated .",
    "however if the distribution continues to vary much slower than @xmath18 , the ( properly normalized ) multiplicity of produced gluons is always smaller for central collisions than for the peripheral ones .    in this light",
    ", the results of  @xcite should be understood in the following way . in a particular saturation ansatz considered in  @xcite for @xmath19 in the scaling window",
    ", @xmath20 as a function of centrality is indeed proportional to the number of participants @xmath8 .",
    "however its value is always _",
    "greater _ than that for the leading order perturbative prediction for the same momentum , even though the latter is proportional to the number of collisions @xmath21 .",
    "this holds as long as the transverse momentum in question is greater than the saturation momentum for the most central collisions considered . thus according to the saturation scenario ,",
    "the number of produced particles in the intermediate transverse momentum range is enhanced and not suppressed relative to the leading order perturbative one .",
    "this enhancement in the overall production may or may not result in the cronin enhancement when comparing the production rates for central versus peripheral collisions , as the evolution is equally effective for all impact parameters .",
    "before we proceed further , we wish to make clear the following points .",
    "first , to calculate the gluon production we use the @xmath0 factorized formalism as in  @xcite .",
    "although it has not been proved to hold for this process and is likely not to be strictly valid , one may hope as in  @xcite that it gives a qualitatively reasonable description of gluon production .",
    "second , in this note we only address the multiplicity of produced gluons . for comparison with experimental data , this quantity has to be convoluted with gluon fragmentation functions to convert it to the number of produced hadrons .",
    "this introduces additional uncertainties related to our limited knowledge of the dynamics of the system between the time of production and the time of hadronization  @xcite , and the possible medium - dependence of parton fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "thus our results have to be paralleled to those of  @xcite prior to convolution with fragmentation functions .",
    "the simple @xmath0-factorized formula for the gluon yield at central rapidity in a collision of identical nuclei  @xcite used in  @xcite is @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the overlap area in the transverse plane between the nuclei at fixed impact parameter @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the rapidity difference between the central rapidity and the fragmentation region and @xmath26 is the intrinsic momentum dependent nuclear gluon distribution function , related to the standard gluon distribution by @xmath27 eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) itself is an approximation even within the @xmath0-factorization scheme for two reasons .",
    "first , the gluon distribution is considered to be effectively impact parameter independent and taken at some representative impact parameter inside the overlap region .",
    "second the rapidity of both distribution functions is taken to be the same rather than integrating over the relative rapidity of the two distributions .",
    "this amounts to the assumption that the gluons are produced locally in rapidity and keep the same rapidity label as in the parent distribution function .",
    "the first assumption in principle is easily relaxed by considering @xmath24-dependent distributions , although it makes the calculation considerably more cumbersome .",
    "the second assumption is more questionable .",
    "one certainly expects `` migration '' in rapidity during the interaction , and in particular the relevant rapidities should depend on the produced transverse momentum .",
    "this is certainly the case in the collinear factorized perturbative formalism , where the parent rapidities are taken at @xmath28 .",
    "however in the present case the production is not necessarily through the @xmath29 process , and thus the rapidities are not fixed in the same way . keeping these caveats in mind",
    ", we now consider the implications of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .    in a purely perturbative approach , neglecting the effects of saturation the gluon distribution function at impact parameter @xmath24 has the shape @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the density of participants , taken as reference for @xmath32 collisions .",
    "the role of @xmath33 in the denominator is to regulate the gluon distribution in the infrared .",
    "the additional numerical multiplicative factor @xmath34 reflects the fact that the gluons at low @xmath17 originate not only from the valence quarks , but also from the sea quarks and energetic gluons .",
    "saturation effects modify the gluon distribution so that it is suppressed at low momenta @xmath35 .",
    "there are several models in the literature which provide such saturated distribution function . in this note",
    "we consider two types of models .",
    "the mclerran - venugopalan model  @xcite achieves saturation by taking into account the glauber - mueller multiple scattering effects .",
    "the intrinsic glue distribution in this model was calculated in  @xcite @xmath36 we will take the saturation momentum to be @xmath37-dependent following  @xcite @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the _ nucleon _ gluon distribution .",
    "we will take the gluon distribution in the nucleon to be of the simple perturbative form  @xcite @xmath40    the small regulator @xmath41 ensures that the saturation momentum stays positive for @xmath42 . for the numerical evaluations we choose @xmath43 , such that for momenta @xmath44 the sensitivity on the infrared cut off @xmath45 is negligible .",
    "we take @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the saturation scale @xmath48 is obtained from the solution of the implicit equation eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , when evaluated at @xmath49 . at @xmath50 we fix @xmath51 throughout this paper ; this corresponds to @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "the mv distribution appears in the light cone gauge calculation as the average of the gluon number density operator in the state with random distribution of color charges distributed with the nuclear density  @xcite . on the other hand as shown in  @xcite , in the covariant gauge calculation of dis - like processes it accounts precisely for the rescattering of the produced gluon inside the nucleus .",
    "the effect of these multiple rescatterings is to broaden the gluon transverse momentum spectrum by the amount @xmath53 .",
    "accordingly , the low momentum part of @xmath54 is suppressed relative to the perturbative gluon , the region around @xmath55 is enhanced , while at large momenta @xmath56 there is no appreciable change relative to the perturbative gluon .",
    "fig.[fig : fig1]a shows the ratio of the mv gluon to the perturbative one as a function of momentum for fixed coupling constant @xmath57 .",
    "the multiple rescatterings do not change the total number of gluons but only redistribute the gluon momentum .",

    "the cronin effect is therefore present in the mv gluon _ ab initio_.",
    "this has been noticed in  @xcite .",
    "the question we are interested in , is to what extent this effect shows up in nuclear collisions .",
    "the mv gluon distribution does not contain any evolution in @xmath17 .",
    "one way to introduce the @xmath17 dependence is to adopt the golec - biernat - wsthoff procedure  @xcite , whereby the saturation momentum is taken to be energy dependent with the factor @xmath65 , with @xmath66 . in this paper",
    "we are not going to explore the energy dependence of the spectrum , and thus for our purposes the energy independent mv ansatz is sufficient .",
    "another type of saturated gluon distribution has been used in  @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence in the rhic energy range is not large enough to allow one to explore the perturbatively predicted @xmath17 dependence of the distribution function .",
    "one can nevertheless consider @xmath67 ( at both 130 and 200 gev ) as being evolved by the perturbative evolution from lower energies .",
    "such an energy evolution leaves a distinctive imprint on the @xmath0 dependence of the gluon .",
    "although the solution of the nonlinear qcd evolution equation  @xcite has not been analyzed in great detail , its qualitative features have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued in  @xcite that in the wide region of momenta @xmath68 the evolved distribution behaves as @xmath69^\\gamma     \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] with the anomalous dimension @xmath70 a slightly different analysis of  @xcite based on doubly logarithmic approximation suggests @xmath71 . in either case due to the large anomalous dimension",
    ", @xmath72 is very significantly enhanced over the perturbative @xmath73 in the wide range of momenta . at asymptotically large momenta @xmath72 again reduces to the perturbative expression .",

    "the behavior outside the scaling window is not known analytically .",
    "one expects that at asymptotically large momenta the behavior of @xmath72 is perturbative , and therefore @xmath74 .",
    "the crossover from the scaling with the anomalous dimension to the perturbative one can in principle be either sharp at the edge of the window , or can be very gradual and slow . to explore the possible differences between the fast and slow crossovers we will use two parametrizations of the distribution function .    to model the function with the fast crossover we take for illustration @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 here , @xmath78 , consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) at @xmath79 .",
    "the parametrization of @xmath80 is chosen to be consistent with the required behavior at large @xmath0 as well as at @xmath81  @xcite .",

    "the gluon @xmath72 is supposed to saturate or grow at most logarithmically . in our ansatz",
    "this saturation is ensured by the presence of the term @xmath84 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .    to model the possibility of the slow crossover we will take simply the function with fixed anomalous dimension : @xmath85 although this function never approaches the perturbative asymptotics , for the purposes of numerical evaluation it is indistinguishable from a function with slowly varying @xmath86 .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) parametrizes the gluon distribution directly in momentum space .",
    "we found that this is the simplest way to generate an acceptable @xmath67 to be used in the framework of eq .",

    "when compared to the leading order perturbative distribution eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) they show suppression at @xmath100 and enhancement at @xmath101 . in fig.[fig : fig1]a , we show the ratio @xmath102 in the scaling model the enhancement is much more pronounced .",
    "it is clear that using the same ansatz , but with @xmath71 rather than @xmath103 would make this enhancement even greater .    in relation to the mv",
    "gluon the perturbative distribution eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) is the relevant distribution to be used to model the peripheral collisions .",
    "for the evolved functions a more meaningful comparison is with the `` peripheral '' distribution of the same functional form as @xmath72 but with a smaller value of @xmath10 . in fig.[fig :",

    "we observe that the ratios for @xmath109 and @xmath110 are very different .",
    "while the ratio @xmath111 exhibits enhancement for the momenta in the scaling window , no such enhancement is seen in @xmath112 .",
    "the reason is that with the ansatz @xmath113 as long as @xmath0 is outside the scaling window of the peripheral distribution , but inside the window of the central one ( that is for @xmath114 ) the ratio @xmath115 is practically equal to @xmath116 .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath117 because of a very slow approach to asymptotic behavior .",
    "instead , for all momenta of interest @xmath118 we note that the physics of the enhancement of @xmath116 for @xmath72 is different from that of @xmath59 .",
    "according to  @xcite and  @xcite the anomalous dimension of the evolved distribution is a direct consequence of the linear bfkl ( or doubly logarithmic ) evolution and is not significantly affected by the nonlinearity of bk equation .",
    "as opposed to multiple rescatterings resummed in @xmath59 , the bfkl evolution greatly increases the total number of gluons relative to the perturbative distribution .",
    "thus the enhancement of @xmath72 is not due to the gluon number conserving redistribution of the gluon momentum , but rather due to the bfkl growth of the total number of gluons .",
    "the slow fall off of @xmath72 with momentum in the scaling window and the associated clear momentum broadening is the result of the bfkl diffusion , which fills the phase space very far from the momentum at which the distribution is peaked at initial energy .",
    "although some qualitative features of saturating gluon distributions appear to be model - independent , quantitative results can vary significantly , see fig.[fig : fig1]a and fig.[fig : fig1]b . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we discuss the implications of this model - dependence for the spectrum eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , and we study the behavior of @xmath119 as a function of transverse momentum and centrality .",
    "for the perturbative gluon distribution eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , the main contribution to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) comes from the region of phase space @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the contribution from the bulk of the phase space @xmath122 is logarithmically suppressed due to the fast decrease of the perturbative distribution function with @xmath0 .",
    "one finds @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the euler constant . with eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) this spectrum scales with @xmath125 as expected perturbatively .    for the saturated gluon distribution in the mv model the gluon yield eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is expressed by @xmath126 since small momenta @xmath19 are suppressed in the mv gluon distribution , expression ( [ eq16 ] ) is smaller than the perturbative one . for small @xmath127 , the @xmath37-dependence of the saturation scale eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) is frozen , and one finds @xmath128 thus , for small transverse momentum , the spectrum ( [ eq17 ] ) scales with the number of participants , i.e. @xmath129 numerically , however , we find that the limit ( [ eq17 ] ) provides a fair approximation for the full expression ( [ eq16 ] ) in a very small @xmath31-dependent region below @xmath130 gev only .    in fig.[fig :",

    "for a saturated gluon distribution and @xmath137 , one does not gain a logarithmic enhancement factor from the low momentum region , @xmath138 .",
    "however due to enhancement in the intermediate region one gets a bigger contribution to the integral from @xmath139 . since both factors of @xmath67 are enhanced in this region , we expect that for some momentum range this enhancement will overcome the suppression in the small momentum range , and therefore will lead to a net excess of produced gluons relative to the perturbative result .",
    "this is seen in fig.[fig : fig2 ] as a small but clear cronin enhancement of the produced gluon number for momenta just above the saturation scale .",
    "the amount of enhancement depends on the value of the coupling constant , but qualitatively the phenomenon persists for any @xmath140 .    for the evolved distributions @xmath72 , since the @xmath0 dependence is very slow , the contribution to the integral comes from a very large range of momenta - for @xmath19 in the scaling region the integral is dominated by @xmath141 .",
    "this leads to a significant enhancement of gluon production for all @xmath137 relative to the perturbative expression .",
    "it is however more interesting to consider the ratio of the central to peripheral yields .",

    "this plot mirrors the plot for a single distribution fig.[fig : fig1]b .",
    "the distribution @xmath109 displays a clear cronin effect similar to the mv gluon , while @xmath117 shows uniform suppression for the central / peripheral ratio for all momenta .",
    "although the ratio of the yields for @xmath113 is smaller than unity at @xmath144 , we have checked numerically that at very large @xmath19 it slowly approaches unity from below .",
    "we thus conclude that the properties of the ratio are very sensitive to the way in which the distribution behaves outside the scaling window .",
    "we discuss now to what extent the gluon spectrum ( [ eq2 ] ) shows an approximate @xmath8 or @xmath145 scaling in some kinematic regime . to this end , we plot the gluon yield normalized to the yield for peripheral collisions at @xmath146 , corresponding to @xmath147  @xcite , @xmath148 this quantity is plotted for the mv gluon in fig.[fig : fig3 ] and for the evolved gluon distributions ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ slow ] ) in fig.[fig : fig4 ] , for various fixed values of @xmath19 as a function of @xmath149 .",

    "for the evolved gluon the centrality dependence is again sensitive to the large momentum behavior . for @xmath113 at @xmath152 the centrality dependence is similar to the mv gluon .",
    "one does not recover @xmath8 scaling even in the enlarged centrality region @xmath153 .",
    "the qualitative features of figs.[fig : fig4 ] and [ fig : fig5 ] at small and large @xmath149 at @xmath154 can be understood as follows : at small @xmath149 , the saturation momentum @xmath10 is small so that the scaling window does not exist ; the overall yield scales with @xmath145 , like the perturbative one . this @xmath145 behavior should persist as long as 3 gev is above the scaling window , @xmath155 ( for our parametrization @xmath156 ) .",

    "the reason why the scaling of eq .",

    "( [ eq21 ] ) neglects the finite width of the scaling window .",
    "since the function @xmath113 decreases quite slowly in the scaling window , the yield gets significant contributions from momenta above @xmath162 .",

    "we find also that in p - a collisions the cronin ratio in the evolved case depends strongly on the properties of the evolved distribution above the scaling window .",
    "in summary , our study illustrates that quantitative results depend largely on the precise model - dependent implementation of saturation effects .",
    "a generic qualitative feature for the multiple scattering situation is that perturbative saturation leads to cronin - type transverse momentum broadening of the produced gluon spectrum in both nucleus - nucleus and proton(deuteron)-nucleus collisions . in the evolved case",
    "there is an overall enhancement of the production yield relative to the perturbative baseline .",
    "the spectrum also exhibits strong transverse momentum broadening due to relatively large anomalous dimension . on the other hand ,",
    "the absence or presence of the cronin effect strongly depends on the behavior of the distribution function outside the scaling window . at present",
    "the shape of the evolved distribution in this momentum range is not known analytically .",
    "the recent numerical study  @xcite strongly indicates that crossover from the scaling regime to the perturbative one is very slow and gradual , and that the cronin effect which is present in the mv gluon is wiped out by the quantum evolution at high energies .",
    "thus , @xmath117 in eq .",
    "( [ slow ] ) seems to provide a more realistic parametrization of the evolved gluon distribution than @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "although the centrality dependence of the produced gluon spectrum shows @xmath8 scaling in some limiting case , it can differ significantly from a simple @xmath8 or @xmath145 scaling in the experimentally accessible regime depending on the shape of the gluon distribution .    a detailed comparison of perturbative saturation models to data not only requires the knowledge of the distribution and the improvement of the calculation of the gluon production yield beyond the factorized expression ( [ eq2 ] ) used in this paper .",
    "it also requires the inclusion of fragmentation functions for gluons into pions , and a discussion of their possible medium - dependence  @xcite .    on the qualitative level",
    "however we observe that the gluon distributions which lead to the cronin effect in d - au collisions also lead to the cronin enhancement in the au - au collisions . and",
    "vice versa , if no cronin effect appears in au - au , none is seen in d - au collisions .",
    "given the recent experimental observation of the cronin enhancement in d - au collisions at rhic  @xcite this supports the view that significant final state ( `` quenching '' ) effects are needed in order to account for the au - au data  @xcite .",
    "* note added . * when preparing the revised version of this paper we were made aware of  @xcite and  @xcite which also study the effects of saturation on the cronin enhancement .",
    "these references agree with our results regarding the mv gluon . regarding the evolved gluon ,",
    "the detailed numerical study is reported in  @xcite .",
