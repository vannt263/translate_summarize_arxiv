    "short - duration , hard - spectrum @xmath3-ray bursts ( short grbs ) , whose durations are typically less than two seconds , have been widely speculated to be powered by mergers of two compact objects , either two neutron stars , ns - ns ; or a neutron star and a black hole , ns - bh @xcite .",
    "tentative evidence for such progenitor models includes the host galaxy properties , locations in the host galaxies , as well as the non - association of bright supernovae with short grbs @xcite .",
    "a `` smoking - gun '' signature of these events are the so - called kilonova , which is a supernova - like near - infrared / optical transient powered by radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized in the ejecta launched during the mergers @xcite and sometimes also contributed by a long - lived central engine @xcite .",
    "such a signal had remained elusive due to its faint and transient nature until recently . at 15:49:14 ut on june 3 2013 , grb 130603b with a duration",
    "@xmath4 s in the 15 - 350 kev band triggered the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard the _ swift _ satellite .",
    "this burst is an archetypal short - hard grb @xcite because of the following properties : ( a ) the bat light curve did not show any `` extended emission '' down to @xmath5 level ; ( b ) a spectral lag analysis revealed no significant lag between low and high energy photons ; ( c ) observations of the event by konus / wind gave a rest frame peak energy @xmath6 kev .",
    "a _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) observation was made about 1 week after trigger , it revealed a bright near - infrared source @xcite , which is suggested to be consistent with the prediction of the kilonova calculations @xcite .",
    "this supports the compact star merger origin of this short grb .",
    "aother possibility proposed by jin et al .",
    "( 2013 ) that the infrared bump may be attributed to the synchrotron radiation of a mildly - relativistic blast wave is disfavored by the non - detection of a simultaneous brightening in the radio band ( fong et al .",
    "2013 ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we constrain the central engine properties using both the early x - ray and u - band afterglow and the late infrared bump data .",
    "we argue that the data are consistent with a supra - massive magnetar that undergoes significant gravitational wave energy loss during the early spin - down phase .",
    "( 0,300 ) ( 0,0 )    the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on board _ swift _ began to take data from 43 s after the burst trigger .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the x - ray data is a shallow decline phase lasting @xmath2 s ( fig.1 , adapted from http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt@xmath7curves/00557310/ @xcite ) .",
    "_ swift _ s ultraviolet optical telescope ( uvot ) started to observe the burst approximately 62 s after trigger .",
    "a faint source at the location of the afterglow was detected in all 7 uvot filters but these emissions are so faint that a single u filter light curve was computed from the 7 uvot filters to improve the signal to noise @xcite .",
    "this is also presented in fig.1 ( data from @xcite except that the upper limits are at a @xmath8 confidence level ) .",
    "the early upper limits and later detections in the u - band suggests that the early u band light curve should be flat or even rise with time .",
    "these features are difficult to interpret within the standard fireball afterglow model framework if the central engine energy injection is impulsive .",
    "this can be understood as the following .",
    "if the grb central engine gives an impulsive energy injection , a shallowly decaying x - ray lightcurve and a slowly rising optical lightcurve at early epochs are possible only if the fireball is in the fast cooling regime @xcite , and the x - ray band is between the cooling frequency ( @xmath9 ) and the typical synchrotron frequency ( @xmath10 ) , while the u - band is below @xmath9 .",
    "such a possibility , however , is strongly disfavored by the spectral data .",
    "the spectrum of x - ray emission at @xmath11 s is @xmath12 , which is inconsistent with a fast cooling spectrum @xmath13 .",
    "an even much stronger constraint comes from the spectral energy distribution at @xmath14 day , which gives a @xmath15 hz @xcite . together with the 6.7 ghz flux @xmath16 mjy at @xmath17 day , one has @xmath18 hz and the maximum specific flux @xmath19 mjy ( see also fong et al .",
    "2013 ) . for a burst born in an ism - like circum - burst medium",
    ", we have @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "therefore at @xmath22 day we have @xmath23 hz and @xmath24 hz , which are far from what is needed in the fast cooling model .    an x - ray shallow decline phase is commonly observed in _ swift _ long grbs , which can be interpreted as energy injection into the grb blast wave from a long - lasting central engine @xcite .",
    "we take a general energy injection law @xmath25 for @xmath26 s @xcite , which gives @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "since at @xmath30 , one has @xmath31 hz and @xmath23 hz , the optical emission should rise with time as @xmath32 while the x - ray ( 1.7 kev ) emission drops with time as @xmath33/4}$ ] . for @xmath34",
    "relevant for a spinning down magnetar due to magnetic dipole radiation , both the peculiar x - ray and optical emissions can be accounted for ( fig.1 ) .",
    "such a relatively long , steady energy injection with a roughly constant luminosity is difficult to fulfill in the ns - ns or ns - bh merger scenarios with a black hole central engine .",
    "simulations suggest that long - lasting emission may arise in these systems , but the accretion rate history is essentially defined by the accretion rate of fall - back materials , which typically satisfies @xmath35 ( see fig.3 of * ? ? ? * for both ns - ns merger and ns - bh merger scenarios ) and is _ far from what needed in current afterglow modeling to @xmath36 for the prompt accretion and the fall - back accretion phases , the prompt emission lasting @xmath37 s and a late plateau - like emission lasting @xmath38 s may be possible ( lee et al .",
    "it is however unclear how such a huge change of @xmath39 can take place.]_.     we then turn to the possibility that a long - lived supra - massive magnetar rather than a black hole was promptly formed after the merger @xcite .",
    "this is possible if the neutron star equation - of - state is stiff enough , and if the total mass of the two merging neutron stars is not large enough ( e.g. , morrison et al .",
    "2004 ; giacomazzo & perna 2013 ) . indeed ,",
    "for a sufficiently stiff equation of state yielding @xmath40 , the merger of double neutron stars with a total gravitational mass @xmath41 ( note that among the ten neutron star binary systems identified so far , five have such a total mass ) can produce a supra - massive magnetar with @xmath42 ms , which survives until a good fraction of its rotational energy has been lost via dipole radiation and gravitational wave radiation ( see * ? ? ? * and the references therein ) .",
    "as already mentioned , at @xmath14 day , the key parameters governing the synchrotron spectrum are @xmath43 hz , @xmath44 hz and @xmath45 . adopting eqs.(2 - 4 ) of fan & piran ( 2006 ;",
    "see also yost et al .",
    "2003 ) , it is straightforward to show @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy of the ejecta and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is the fraction of shock energy given to the electrons ( magnetic field ) , @xmath50 is the number density of the interstellar medium and has been normalized to @xmath51 , and the energy distribution power - law index of the shock electrons is taken as @xmath52 based on the optical and x - ray spectral data @xcite",
    ". please note that we have inserted the compton parameter @xmath53/2 \\sim 1 $ ] into eq.(4 ) of fan & piran ( 2006 ) to estimate the physical parameters governing @xmath9 .",
    "interestingly these relations imposes a tight constraint on the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy of the ejecta , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath49 is not expected to be considerably larger than @xmath55 ( i.e. , the equilibrium argument , for which the shock energy is equally shared among electrons , protons , and magnetic fields ) , we then have @xmath56 our result is remarkably consistent with the independent modeling of the late x - ray data by @xcite , in which @xmath57 erg was inferred .",
    "therefore we have shown analytically that the peculiar x - ray and optical data in the first @xmath2 s strongly suggests the energy injection of the magnetar into the blast wave .",
    "on the other hand , the normally declining late radio , optical and x - ray afterglow data impose a very tight constraint on the kinetic energy of the blast wave @xmath58 erg .",
    "the energy injection rate is thus needed to be @xmath59    it is intriguing to note that modeling of the infrared bump also gives a similar isotropic energy for the kilonova component . according to @xcite and @xcite and also our numerical results below ,",
    "the data require @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which correspond to @xmath62 erg .",
    "the near constant isotropic equivalent kinetic energy in the jet component and the kilonova component would demand coincidence if the central engine is a black hole , but would be a natural outcome if the central engine is a millisecond magnetar .",
    "we postulate that the magnetar collapses into a black hole at @xmath63 s. interestingly , fong et al .",
    "( 2013 ) suggested that the x - ray afterglow has an unexpected excess at @xmath64 day , which may be attributed to the emission powered by fall - back accretion onto a central black hole .",
    "such a model is in agreement with our scenario .",
    "for a long - lived magnetar formed in an ns - ns merger , the initial rotation period is expected to be @xmath65ms , and only for such a short spin period the uniform rotation can play an non - ignorable role in stabilizing the magnetar ( see fan et al .",
    "2013 and the references therein ) . the initial rotational energy of a supremassive magnetar is therefore expected to be a few @xmath66 erg , much larger than the inferred @xmath0 erg .",
    "lack of a bright electromagnetic emission component , the missing energy has to be carried away by a non - electromagnetic component .",
    "there is no known mechanism to release this huge amount of energy via thermal neutrinos .",
    "here we focus on the possibility that the energy is carried away via gravitational wave radiation .",
    "a magnetar loses rotational energy through magnetic dipole radiation and gravitational wave radiation @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the ellipticity in terms of the principal moments of inertia ( i.e. , @xmath70 ) , @xmath71 is the radius of the magnetar , @xmath72 is the surface magnetic field strength _ at the pole _ , and @xmath73 ( @xmath74 is the rotation period in units of second ) . to lose a considerable amount of rotational energy of the supramassive magnetar in @xmath75 s mainly via gravitational wave radiation , the ellipticity should be @xmath76 such an ellipticity is larger than the maximum elastic quadrupole deformation of a conventional neutron star .",
    "it may be accommodated by one of the following two possibilities .",
    "first , if the magnetar is not a normal neutron star but a crystalline color - superconducting quark matter @xcite , then such a large deformation is allowed ( the quark star model , though highly speculative , is also helpful to solve the baryon pollution problem of grbs @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility discussed the literature is that a super - strong interior magnetic field of a magnetar could induce a sizable prolate deformation @xcite .",
    "indeed a recent study on the magnetic field slow decay of neutron stars suggests that the initial interior magnetic field of both soft gamma - ray repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars is @xmath77 gauss @xcite . in principle , for a magnetar rotating with @xmath65 ms , an initial interior magnetic field @xmath78 gauss is possible @xcite .",
    "the interior field is likely dominated by the toroidal component @xmath79 ( in a recent calculation , fujisawa et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that the volume - averaged poloidal component could be @xmath80 ) . adopting eq.(4 ) of usov ( 1992 )",
    "would be a few times smaller .",
    "however , as summarized in their second footnote , that estimate is a very conservative lower limit . ]",
    ", we get @xmath81 for @xmath82",
    ". the large required deformation would be possible if the strong toroidal magnetic field is stable ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the dipole radiation of the supramssive magnetar has a luminosity @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 , and @xmath39 is the angle between the rotational and dipole axes .",
    "one can see the required magnetar luminosity ( @xmath85 ) can be reproduced with a reasonable @xmath86 gauss . for magnetar energy loss dominated by gravitational wave radiation , the energy injection rate into the blast wave and the ejecta launched during the merger can be approximated as @xmath87 , as long as the gravitational wave radiation luminosity is much larger than @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the spin down timescale of the magnetar due to gravitational wave radiation . for @xmath90 , the term",
    "@xmath91 is almost a constant ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) , so that @xmath93 applied in the above analysis is justified . for @xmath94 gauss ,",
    "the spin - down of the magnetar by a neutrino - driven wind is likely unimportant ( thompson et al . 2004 ) .",
    "below we present our numerical results to fit the broad - band data . with the code developed by fan & piran ( 2006 ) and zhang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we take @xmath95 for @xmath96 s , and @xmath97 otherwise , to model the afterglow lightcurves ( fig.1 ) . by adopting the following forward shock physical parameters : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 erg , and @xmath103 , we show in fig.1 that the x - ray and optical afterglow lightcurves up to @xmath104 day can be reasonably reproduced . in contrast",
    ", the constant energy model ( fig.2 of fong et al . 2013 ) over predicts the x - ray flux early on .",
    "our fit to the radio afterglow is somewhat poor ( c.f .",
    "fong et al .",
    "2013 ) , possibly due to the radio scintillation @xcite .",
    "here @xmath105 is the initial kinetic energy of the grb ejecta and @xmath106 is the half - opening angle of the grb ejecta .",
    "these shock parameters are consistent with that found in fong et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "the magnetar wind is essentially mildly anisotropic .",
    "the wide - beam wind must run into the merger ejecta .",
    "such an energy injection could lead the merger ejecta to be a mildly - relativistic speed @xcite and/or to produce a bright `` mergernova '' @xcite . adopting the same isotropic - equivalent rate of energy injection from the magnetar found in modeling grb afterglow",
    ", we fit the kilonova data using the method delineated in @xcite , where the dynamical evolution of the merger ejecta is taken into account .",
    "the near infrared data can be well reproduced given an ejecta mass @xmath107 , an initial velocity of the ejecta @xmath108 , a magnetar collapsing time @xmath109 s , and an effective constant opacity @xmath110 . here",
    "the adopted opacity is much higher than the typical one associated with electron scattering , because the bound - bound , bound - free , and free - free transitions of ions could provide more important contributions to opacity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the required ejecta mass is at the high - end of simulated ejecta mass @xcite for ns - ns mergers .",
    "the kilonova outflow had been accelerated to a velocity @xmath111 and its total kinetic energy is @xmath112 erg .",
    "we have shown that energy injection from a supra - massive magnetar central engine can reproduce the early ( @xmath113 s ) x - ray and optical afterglow data of the short grb 130603b .",
    "the inferred isotropic - equivalent kinetic energies of both the afterglow and the kilonova are both @xmath112 erg .",
    "this is consistent with energy injection from a near - isotropic millisecond magnetar .",
    "the relatively small value of the energy budget requires that most energy is carried away via non - electromagnetic signals , and we argue that it is due to gravitational wave radiation with a large deformation of the magnetar .",
    "the proposed einstein telescope may be able to detect the required gravitational wave radiation signal , if the source is within a distance @xmath114 mpc @xcite .",
    "the strong evidence of a supra - massive magnetar central engine from a ns - ns merger event suggests an optimistic prospect of detecting electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave triggers in the upcoming advanced ligo / virgo era .",
    "since the magnetar wind is essentially isotropic , a bright early multi - wavelength afterglow is expected from gravitational wave triggers even without an associated short grb @xcite , which can be readily detected by wide field x - ray and optical cameras .    although the supra - massive magnetar model has been widely adopted to interpret the short grb data , how to produce a short grb with such a central engine",
    "is still a question .",
    "one possibility is that the initial nascent neutron star rotates differentially and the magnetic braking and viscosity combine to drive the star to uniform rotation within a time scale @xmath115 , if the surface magnetic field strength of the star reaches @xmath116 g @xcite .",
    "the magnetic activity of the differentially rotating neutron star may be able to drive short but energetic @xmath117ray outbursts and thus account for the short grb prompt emission @xcite . in",
    "the _ more - speculative _ strange quark star scenario , phase transition from neutron matter to strange quark matter may proceed in a short period of time , and the released energy may power a short grb ( alternatively , the accretion of the disk material onto the strange quark star may power a short grb ) . in any case , a smoking gun signature of the magneter central engine for short grbs may be retrieved in the future gravitational wave data .",
