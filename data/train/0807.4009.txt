    "the tools of statistical mechanics have been successfully applied in several problems of information theory in recent years . in particular ,",
    "in the field of error correcting codes @xcite , spreading codes @xcite , and compression codes @xcite , statistical mechanical techniques have shown great potential .",
    "the present paper uses similar techniques to investigate a lossy compression scheme .",
    "lossless compression , which was first pointed out by the pioneering paper of shannon @xcite , has been widely studied for many years .",
    "after much effort , a set of very good codes have been designed and practical implementations have been proposed @xcite .",
    "lossy compression , on the other hand , was also first studied by another paper of shannon @xcite .",
    "a lot of practical lossy compression schemes were developed over the years ( for example jpeg compression , mpeg compression etc . ) but at the present time , none of these schemes saturate the shannon bound given by the _ rate - distortion theorem_. nevertheless , several theoretical schemes which reach this optimal bound have already been proposed . recently ,",
    "shannon optimal codes based on sparse systems have been discovered @xcite and it is now the general tendency to use such kinds of systems .",
    "these codes saturate the shannon bound asymptotically , ( i.e. : for an infinite codeword length ) , and in the dense generating matrix limit ( but low connectivity sparse matrix already gives near shannon performance ) .",
    "however , there is still a lot of work to be done for densely connected systems .",
    "one of such systems is given by using perceptron - based decoder .",
    "there have been some recent studies on the encoding problem of such schemes using the belief propagation ( bp ) algorithm and the results seems promising @xcite .",
    "the foundations of this encoding method for such lossy compression schemes was originally put forward by murayama using the tap equations applied to sourlas - type codes @xcite .",
    "it is important to study a wide class of decoder to extract a pool of schemes which can give near shannon bound performance prior to fully investigate the encoding problem .",
    "the study of such schemes could gives interesting clues on how the lossy compression process works , and it might also help to pinpoint some essential features a scheme should possess in order to achieve shannon optimal performance .",
    "this paper extends the framework introduced in @xcite and studies three different decoders based on a non - monotonic multilayer perceptron .",
    "hosaka et al .",
    "studied the simple perceptron network featuring a non - monotonic transfer function in order to have a mirror symmetry property in their model ( i.e. : @xmath0 ) .",
    "this was motivated by the belief that the edwards - anderson order parameter should be zero to reach the shannon bound .",
    "consequently , if one codeword @xmath1 is optimal ( note that here optimal denotes a codeword which gives the minimum achievable distortion for the concerned scheme ) , @xmath2 is also optimal .",
    "then , they show that for an infinite length codeword , their scheme effectively saturates the shannon bound .",
    "next , one interesting feature of the model proposed by mimura et al .",
    "@xcite is to increase the number of optimal codewords by using a multilayer decoder network .",
    "the number of optimal codeword is function of the number of hidden units @xmath3 in the decoder network ( for example , in their parity - tree model with an even number of hidden units , there are at least @xmath4 optimal codewords ) .",
    "thus , one can expect that finding an optimal codeword becomes more and more easy as the number of hidden units increases .",
    "nevertheless , their model deal only with unbiased messages .",
    "the main advantage of the model proposed in this paper is to combine the benefits of hosaka et al .",
    "model ( mirror symmetry and ability to deal with biased messages ) with the benefits of mimura et al .",
    "model ( increasing number of optimal codewords with the number of hidden units ) . by studying three different schemes we would like to extract some essential characteristics a good lossy compression framework should possess .",
    "finally , the almeida - thouless ( at ) stability of the obtained solutions is also studied and presents very good properties with almost no unstable part .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the framework of lossy compression .",
    "section iii exposes our model .",
    "section iv presents the mathematical tools used to evaluate the performance of the present scheme .",
    "section v states some results concerning the validity of the obtained solutions and section vi is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "let us begin by introducing the framework of lossy data compression @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 be a discrete random variable defined on a source alphabet @xmath6 .",
    "an original source message is composed of @xmath7 random variables , @xmath8 , and compressed into a shorter expression . the encoder compresses the original message @xmath5 into a codeword @xmath1 , using the transformation @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "the decoder maps this codeword @xmath1 onto the decoded message @xmath11 , using the transformation @xmath12 .",
    "the encoding / decoding scheme can be represented as in figure [ fig : framework ] .        in this case , the code rate is defined by @xmath13 .",
    "a distortion function @xmath14 is defined as a mapping @xmath15 . for each possible pair of @xmath16 , it associates a positive real number . in most of the cases ,",
    "the reproduction alphabet @xmath17 is the same as the alphabet @xmath6 on which the original message @xmath5 is defined .",
    "hereafter , we set @xmath18 , and we use the hamming distortion as the distortion function of the scheme .",
    "this distortion function is given by @xmath19 so that the quantity @xmath20 measures how far the decoded message @xmath11 is from the original message @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , it records the error made on the original message during the encoding / decoding process .",
    "the probability of error distortion can be written @xmath21=p[y \\neq \\hat{y}]$ ] where @xmath22 represents the expectation .",
    "therefore , the distortion associated with the code is defined as @xmath23 $ ] , where the expectation is taken with respect to the probability distribution @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "@xmath25 corresponds to the average error per variable @xmath26 .",
    "now we defined a rate distortion pair @xmath27 and we said that this pair is achievable if there exist a coding / decoding scheme such that when @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( note that the rate @xmath30 is kept finite ) , we have @xmath31 \\leq d$ ] . in other words ,",
    "a rate distortion pair @xmath27 is said to be achievable if there exist a pair @xmath32 such that @xmath31 \\leq d$ ] in the limit @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the optimal compression performance that can be obtained in the framework of lossy compression is given by the so - called _ rate distortion function _",
    "@xmath33 which gives the best achievable code rate @xmath30 as a function of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "however , despite the fact that the best achievable performance is known , no clues are given about how to construct such an optimal compression scheme .",
    "moreover , finding explicitly the expression of the rate distortion function is , in general cases , not possible .",
    "nonetheless , for the special case of uniformly biased boolean messages in which each component is generated independently by the same probability distribution @xmath34=1-p[y=1]=p$ ] , it is possible to calculate analytically the rate distortion function @xmath33 , which becomes @xmath35 where @xmath36 . in the sequel",
    ", we restrict ourselves to this particular case ( i.e. : @xmath34=1-p[y=1]=p$ ] and @xmath37 ) .",
    "in this section we introduce our compression scheme . to make the calculations compatible with the statistical mechanics framework , let us map the boolean representation @xmath38 to the ising representation @xmath39 by means of the mapping @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the ising variable and @xmath42 is the boolean one .",
    "on top of that , we set @xmath43 . since we consider that all the @xmath44 are generated independently by an identical biased binary source , we can easily write the corresponding probability distribution , @xmath45 = p \\delta ( 1-y^{\\mu } ) + ( 1-p ) \\delta ( 1+y^{\\mu } ) .",
    "\\label{ydistrib}\\ ] ] next we define the decoder of the compression scheme .",
    "we use a non - linear transformation @xmath46 which associates a codeword @xmath47 with a sequence @xmath48 . for a given original message @xmath5 , the encoder is simply defined as follows , @xmath49    for the non - linear transformation @xmath50",
    ", we utilize non - monotonic multilayer perceptrons .",
    "the codeword @xmath1 is split down into @xmath51-dimensional @xmath3 disjoint vectors @xmath52 so that @xmath1 can be written @xmath53 . in this paper , we will focus on three different architectures for the non - monotonic multilayer perceptrons . there are the followings :    \\(i ) multilayer parity tree with non - monotonic hidden units .",

    "we avoid this uncertainty by considering only an odd number of hidden units for the committee tree with non - monotonic hidden units in the sequel .",
    "\\(iii ) multilayer committee tree with a non - monotonic output unit .",

    "the general architecture of these perceptrons based decoders is shown in figure [ fig : net ] .",
    "input units and @xmath3 hidden units . ]",
    "note that we can also consider a decoder based on a committee - tree where both the hidden - units and the output unit are non - monotonic .",
    "however , this introduces an extra - parameter ( we will have one threshold parameter for the hidden - units , and one for the output unit ) to tune and the performance should not change drastically . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict our study to the above three cases only .",
    "now let us introduce @xmath68 , an energy function of the system , @xmath69 this energy function @xmath68 is clearly minimized for a codeword @xmath1 which satisfies equation ( [ encoder ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in the ising representation , the hamming distance @xmath14 takes a simple form @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the unit step function which takes @xmath64 for @xmath65 and 0 for @xmath72 .",
    "the encoding phase can be viewed as a classical perceptron learning problem , where one tries to find the weight vector @xmath1 which minimizes the energy function @xmath68 for the original message @xmath5 and the random input vector @xmath73 .",
    "the vector @xmath1 which achieve this minimum gives us the codeword to be send to the decoder . therefore , in the case of a lossless compression scheme (",
    "i.e. : @xmath74 ) , evaluating the rate distortion property of the present scheme is equivalent to finding the number of couplings @xmath1 which satisfies the input / output relation @xmath75 . in other words",
    ", this is equivalent to the calculation of the storage capacity of the network @xcite .    the choice of parity - tree based and committee - tree based network is motivated by the thorough literature available on this kind of networks .",
    "parity and committee machines have been intensively studied ( see @xcite for an overview ) by the machine - learning community over the years .",
    "the techniques used to calculate the storage capacity of such networks gives us a starting point for our analytical evaluation of the typical performance of the above schemes .",
    "we analyze the performance of these three different compression schemes using the tools of statistical mechanics .",
    "we first define the following partition function , @xmath76 , \\ ] ] where the sum over @xmath1 represents the sum over all the possible states for the vector @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath77 denotes the inverse temperature parameter .",
    "such a partition function can be identified with the partition function of a spin glass system with dynamical variables @xmath1 and quenched variables @xmath73 . for a fixed hamming distortion",
    "@xmath78 $ ] , the average of this partition function over @xmath5 and @xmath73 naturally contains all the interesting typical properties of the scheme such as the entropy .",
    "however , evaluating this average is hard and we need some technique to investigate it . in this paper",
    "we use the so - called _ replica method _ in order to calculate the average of the partition function . in the case of such a discrete system",
    ", the entropy should not be negative so that the zero entropy criterion ( see @xcite ) gives us the best achievable code rate limit . the replica method s calculations to obtain the average of the partition function @xmath79 are detailed in appendix [ appendix.replicamethod ] .      in the lossy compression scheme using parity tree with non - monotonic hidden units ( [ parity ] ) ,",

    "paper @xcite with the exception of the hidden layer transfer function which is given by the non - monotonic transfer function @xmath58 in this paper . by enforcing mirror symmetry in the hidden layer",
    ", we were able to get shannon optimal performance for an infinite length codeword independently of the number of hidden units whereas this was not possible using mimura et al .",
    "model , even for an infinite number of hidden units . in the same way ,",
    "keeping the monotonic @xmath63 function as the transfer function of the hidden layer and transforming only the output unit into a non - monotonic one by the use of @xmath58 ( i.e. : the committee tree with a non monotonic output unit ) , we were able to reach shannon limit with an infinite number of hidden units . once again , enforcing mirror symmetry enabled to get shannon optimal performance .",
    "next , one can easily derive a lower bound for the number of optimal codewords ( here optimal means a codeword which gives the minimum achievable distortion of the corresponding scheme ) for each of the three schemes . in the case of the parity tree and committee tree with non - monotonic hidden units ,",
    "there are at least @xmath152 optimal codewords in the codeword space . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath1 denotes an optimal codeword , we can replace any of its component @xmath153 by @xmath154 without altering the output of the hidden layer and thus leave the output of the network unchanged . in the case of the committee tree with a non - monotonic output unit ,",
    "because of the more complex structure of the hidden layer , we can only guaranty the existence of @xmath155 optimal codewords which are given by @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , a formal encoder for those schemes would require a computational cost which grows exponentially with the original message length to perform its task .",
    "we need more efficient algorithms to reduce the encoding time . a preliminary study made by hosaka et al .",
    "@xcite uses the bp algorithm for this task .",
    "this could be a good solution to achieve the encoding phase in a polynomial time .",
    "another possibility is to use the survey propagation algorithm approach which was developed for satisfiability problems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned above , the parity tree and committee tree with non - monotonic hidden units have their number of optimal codeword which grows exponentially with the number of hidden units .",
    "this could made the search for one optimal codeword easier to achieve using some proper heuristics .",
    "this issue will be studied in a next paper .    *",
