    "furthermore , it may be possible to remove / suppress decoherence with various dynamical decoupling schemes applied to each qubit ( see , e.g. , refs . and ) .",
    "in short , it is reasonable to expect that this exchange - based qubit coupling scheme should lead to better decoherence performance for the @xmath0 qubits than the capacitive coupling scheme .",
    "the transverse field ising model has been extensively explored in the areas of adiabatic quantum computing@xcite and quantum phase transition.@xcite our results here show that the transverse field ising model can be realized in a tunnel - coupled @xmath3 qubit system , making it a potential platform or quantum simulator for implementing adiabatic quantum computing and investigating quantum phase transitions .    in summary ,",
    "starting from the recently introduced generalized hubbard model,@xcite we analytically derive a more complete formula for the exchange coupling between two confined electrons in a dqd .",
    "the tunable exchange coupling depends explicitly on intradot and interdot coulomb repulsions , tunnel couplings , and interdot bias .",
    "these two exchange - coupled electron spins can then be used to encode a singlet - triplet qubit in a strong magnetic field .",
    "we then use the generalized hubbard model to construct the spin hamiltonian for two tunnel - coupled @xmath0 qubits , and derive a general expression for the exchange couplings between neighboring dots in a linear four - dot configuration .",
    "this exchange - based coupling scheme leads to an effective ising interaction between the two @xmath3 qubits .",
    "the coupling strength is limited by the magnetic field gradient between the two dqds , but not limited by the single - qubit energy splittings , and we estimate that the interqubit coupling strength can reach the range of 100 mhz .",
    "we also explore how to generate various two - qubit gates with this coupling .",
    "in particular , we discuss how to construct the controlled - not gate and how to generate bell states .",
    "the results we obtain in our study of a four - quantum - dot system indicate that exchange coupling is a viable alternative to capacitive coupling for @xmath0 qubit .",
    "it is more tunable , and its coupling strength is not directly connected to single - qubit decoherence . with these two favorable features ,",
