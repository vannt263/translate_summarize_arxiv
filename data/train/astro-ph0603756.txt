    "high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are systems composed of an accreting compact object ( magnetized neutron star or black hole ) and an early - type massive star ( white et al .",
    "the majority of the known hmxbs ( @xmath180% ) are be / x - ray binaries consisting of a neutron star orbiting around a be star ; the compact object is characterized by an eccentric orbit , spending most of its time far away from the disk surrounding the be star . during the time of the neutron star s periastron passage , the compact object accretes from the dense equatorial",
    "be star disk producing bright outbursts lasting for several weeks or even months .",
    "the other major group of hmxbs consists of a compact object orbiting around a supergiant early - type star ( ob ) and in this case the x - ray emission is powered by accretion of material originating from the donor star through a strong stellar wind and/or roche - lobe overflow .",
    "stars in the supergiant phase have a very short lifetime ; due to the evolutionary timescales involved supergiant hmxbs ( sgxbs ) are expected to be much less numerous than be / x ray binaries . to date",
    "about a dozen of them have been detected in the classical x - ray band .",
    "integral is changing this picture since its observations are indicating the presence of a new subclass of sgxbs which have been labelled as supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) ( negueruela et al .",
    "2005a ) . most of the time they are undetectable , then occasionally they undergo fast x - ray transient activity lasting less than a day , typically a few hours ( sguera et al . 2005 ) .",
    "their outbursts show complex structures characterized by several fast flares with both rise and decay times of less than 1 hour ( typically a few tens of minutes ) .",
    "this kind of x - ray transient activity is very different from that seen in other high mass x - ray binaries ( i.e. be / x - ray transients ) .",
    "moreover , sfxts differ from classical sgxbs since the latter are known to be persistent bright sources with x - ray luminosities always detectable in the range 10@xmath210@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 while , on the contrary , sfxts present quiescence luminosities with values or upper limits in the range 10@xmath510@xmath6 erg s@xmath4 ( negueruela et al .",
    "the physical origin of the fast outbursts displayed by sfxts is still unknown .",
    "their very short duration is not compatible with viscous timescales in a typical accretion disc ; therefore fast x - ray outbursts from sfxts must be due to a completely different mechanism .",
    "int zand ( 2005 ) has suggested that the origin must be related to the early - type donor star and in particular to the wind accretion mass transfer mode from the supergiant to the compact object .",
    "it could be that the supergiant ejects material in a non - continuous way .",
    "in fact , many early - type stars are characterized by highly structured and variable massive winds ( prinja et al .",
    "2005 ) which could have a fundamentally clumpy nature .",
    "the capture of these clumps by a nearby compact object could then produce fast x - ray flares thereby explaining the observed timescales .",
    "sfxts are difficult to detect because of their very transitory nature ; to date the list consists of 5 objects .",
    "however there are a few more unidentified x - ray sources which display fast x - ray outbursts and are therefore candidate sfxts even if their optical counterpart has not yet been identified with an early - type supergiant ( negueruela et al .",
    "2005a ) .",
    "the ibis / isgri instrument ( ubertini et al . 2003 , lebrun et al . 2003 ) on board the integral satellite ( winkler et al . 2003 ) is particularly suited to the detection of new or already known supergiant fast x - ray transient sources since it provides a very powerful combination of a large fov , good sensitivity and wide energy range .",
    "all are indispensable characteristics for the detection of fast transient events such as sfxts . in this paper",
    ", we report in section 3 on ibis detections of newly discovered fast x - ray outbursts from 3 known sfxts ( xte  j1739@xmath0302 , igr  j18410@xmath00535=ax  j1841.0@xmath00536 , igr  j17544@xmath02619 ) .",
    "moreover , we unveil for the first time the fast x - ray transient nature of igr  j11215@xmath05952 which has been recently identified as a supergiant hmxb ( masetti et al . 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , we report in section 4 on new ibis discoveries of fast x - ray outbursts from 6 more sources ( igr  j16479@xmath04514 , igr  j16418@xmath04532 , ax  j1749.1@xmath02733 , igr  j16195@xmath04945=ax  j161929@xmath04945 , xte  j1743@xmath0363 , igr  j17407@xmath02808 ) .",
    "all of them are still unidentified , but they can be considered as candidate sfxts since their characteristics strongly resemble those of the known sfxts .",
    "the data are collected with the low - energy array , isgri ( integral soft gamma - ray imager ; lebrun et al .",
    "2003 ) , consisting of a pixilated 128@xmath7128 cdte solid - state detector that views the sky through a coded aperture mask .",
    "the reduction and analysis of the isgri data have been performed by using the integral offline scientific analysis ( osa ) v.4.2 available to the public through the integral science data centre isdc ( courvoisier et al .",
    "integral observations are typically divided into short pointings ( science window , scw ) of @xmath1 2000 s duration .",
    "our scw dataset belongs to the core program data collected as part of the galactic plane survey ( gps ) and the galactic centre deep exposure ( gcde ) ( winkler et al . 2003 ) from revolution 45 ( end of february 2003 ) to 307 ( april 2005 ) as well as to all public data released up to revolution 160 .",
    "the set of observations used for our analysis , although being highly inhomogeneous in both extent and exposure , covers @xmath165% of the sky at a level of at least 10 ksec , as can be seen from the exposure map shown in figure 1 . the galactic plane , and in particular the galactic center , are particularly well covered with exposure times of at least 100 and 1000 ksec respectively .",
    "it is not surprising that most of the sfxts so far discovered by integral are located in the proximity of the galactic centre , a region that has been extensively monitored .",
    "figure 2 displays the angular distribution off the galactic plane of the central pointing direction of all ( @xmath1 11300 ) scws in our dataset .",
    "their strong concentration ( @xmath170% , 7900 scws ) towards the galactic plane ( @xmath8b@xmath8@xmath9 5@xmath10 ) rather than medium or high galactic latitude is clearly evident .",
    "sfxts are expected to be mainly located on the galactic plane due to the very young ages of their progenitor stars .",
    "each scw of our dataset has been analysed using the imaging components of the osa4.2 .",
    "a proprietary tool was used to search each scw , and provide a cross - correlated list of all excesses above 5@xmath11 found in one or more scws .",
    "the search was initially performed in the energy band 2030 kev ; but when a source was found then we also checked the detection at higher energies and in the previous and subsequent scws .",
    "this approach is efficient in unveiling very fast transient events lasting only a few hours since the search occurs on the same timescale as the outbursts themselves . integrating for longer",
    "just degrades the signal - to - noise of the detection .",
    "the resulting excesses were then inspected visually to ensure an appropriate point spread function and so to identify them as real sources .",
    "this was necessary in order to reject false detections such as ghosts , structures or background noise .",
    "for each newly discovered fast outburst a more detailed timing and spectral analysis was performed using the osa v.4.2 .",
    "the sensitivity limit for a persistent source detected at 5@xmath11 level ( 2030 kev ) in only one scw of @xmath1 2000 s is @xmath1 25 mcrab . in the case of an outburst visible in more than one consecutive scw",
    ", we can assume our detection limit is again @xmath1 25 mcrab , but now refers to the average flux of the outburst during the scw containing the peak .",
    "note that we do not place any requirements on detection during multiple scws .    due to",
    "possible cross - talk between objects in the same fov , we have also investigated the variability pattern of all other bright sources in the fov , as well as the source of interest .",
    "they have shown a different time variability enabling us to conclude that the light curves obtained for the sources of interest are reliable .",
    "images from the x - ray monitor jem - x ( lund et al . 2003 ) were created for all newly discovered outbursts reported in this paper . in most cases ,",
    "the source was outside or on the edge of the jem - x field of view ; no significant detection were obtained for those inside the fov so we did not take into account jem - x data for our analysis .",
    "xte  j1739@xmath0302=igr  j17391@xmath03021 is a well studied sfxt ( smith et al . 2005 ) . since its discovery in august 1997 by rxte ( smith et al .",
    "1998 ) , the source has been detected in outburst by asca in 1999 ( sakano et al . 2002 ) and by integral in 2003 and 2004 ( sguera et al .",
    "2005 , lutovinov et al .",
    "all previous reported outbursts are characterized by durations ranging from @xmath1 2 hours to @xmath1 half a day .",
    "sguera et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed several detailed isgri lightcurves of the source in outburst which clearly display complex structures with quick flares reaching their peak flux over very short timescales ( a few tens of minutes ) and then dropping off with the same timescale as the rise time . to date , no pulsations have been reported from any of the outbursts detected by the previously cited x - ray missions .",
    "negueruela et al . ( 2005b ) identified the optical counterpart as an o8iab(f ) supergiant at a distance of @xmath1 2.3 kpc . in the optical and infrared , xte",
    "j1739@xmath0302 is very similar to the supergiant hmxb systems .",
    "table 1 contains a list of all ibis detections of outbursts from xte  j1739@xmath0302 . here",
    "we report on a newly discovered fast x - ray outburst of xte  j1739@xmath0302 detected on 21 august 2004 ( no . 6 in table 1 ) . here , and in the subsequent analysis , we assume the beginning of the first scw during which the source was detected as being the start time of the outburst and similarly the burst stop time to be the end of the last scw during which the source was detected .",
    "the source turned on at 05:25:12 utc an showed abrupt outburst activity lasting @xmath1 3 hours , then it turned off at 08:38:03 utc . as we can see from the 2060 kev isgri light curve shown in figure 3 , the fast x - ray transient activity is quite complex .",
    "it is characterized by several sharp flares which reach their peak on very short timescale and then drop with a similar timescale .",
    "this kind of transient behaviour has already been noted in several other outbursts of xte  j1739@xmath0302 detected by ibis ( sguera et al .",
    "a fourier analysis of the lightcurve in figure 3 did not show any significant evidence of pulsations ; however we note that the peaks are approximately separated by @xmath1 2000 s ; another outburst detected by ibis on march 2003 also displayed this kind of characteristic ( sguera et al .",
    "2005 ) . unfortunately in both cases",
    "the duration of the outburst is only a few times the putative period of 2000  s , so the detection of a longer outburst is needed to confirm any such periodicity in the light curve of xte  j1739@xmath0302 .",
    "to date this is the strongest outburst detected by ibis from xte  j1739@xmath0302 . the peak - flux and luminosity ( 2060 kev ) of the strongest flare in figure 3 are @xmath1 480 mcrab and @xmath13.5@xmath710@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the lowest limit for the quiescence luminosity ( 210 kev ) of xte  j1739@xmath0302 is 7@xmath710@xmath5 erg s@xmath4 ( sakano et al .",
