    "recently there was growing interest to the investigation of composite media , called dusty plasmas , consisting of aerosol particles in a gas discharge . besides numerous industrial applications dusty plasmas provide ample opportunities to studying _ in situ _ phase transitions in the dust component , intergrain interactions , grain charging etc .",
    "one of the peculiar features of dusty plasmas is that the average kinetic energy of the dust component , _",
    "i.e. , _ its translational temperature , may be considerably higher than the temperature of the ambient plasma . in details",
    "the problem was studied in the recent papers by quinn and goree @xcite , where in parallel with the experiments a model of the brownian motion explaining anomalous kinetic temperature was developed .",
    "the kinetic description of dusty plasma was discussed in numerous theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "generally , there are two ways plasma particles interact with dust grains : first , the scattering of a particle by grain electric field and , second , the direct impact of a particle on a grain surface . the latter process results in grain charging due to the higher mobility of electrons , it may change grain mass , heat its surface _ etc_. in other words , as it is well - understood nowadays , the adequate statistical description of the dust component should take into account inner degrees of freedom , the most important among which is the grain charge . kinetic consideration of charging process shows that absorption of small plasma particles by grains can result in inequality of the grain temperature and the temperatures of the light components even for the case of equal temperatures of electrons and ions@xcite . to avoid confusion",
    "it should be noted that since the system is open there is no conflict of the latter result with thermodynamics .    under the conditions of experiments on fine grain synthesis @xcite or etching @xcite grain mass",
    "should also be treated as a dynamic variable @xcite .",
    "thermophoretic @xcite and radiometric @xcite forces provided by inhomogeneous heating of the grain surface may also play an important role , under microgravity especially @xcite , that may necessitate inclusion of the temperature distribution inside grains into the kinetic description .",
    "recent experiments on rod - like particulates @xcite demonstrated complicated rotational motion of dust grains . in more general context , the rotation is also of importance for brownian motion of the particles with energy supply @xcite . although the rotation of spherical grains is hardly observable experimentally , it is of interest since it may influence translational motion and heating of the grain surface .",
    "being not quite complete , the above list of various process indicates that the dimension of the phase space required for the kinetic description of the dust component may be rather large : it tends to a rather large value of the order of twenty .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to develop the kinetic theory of the aerosol component taking into account the mass growth and the rotation of grains .",
    "although our main impetus is dusty plasma , here we ignore the process of grain charging .",
    "this may be justified assuming the size of grains exceeds the debye length of the ambient plasma . in other words ,",
    "we treat the ion component as a neutral gas and neglect the influence of electrons .",
    "another reason for accepting this simplification is that we are able to study the problem both analytically and by molecular dynamics simulation : computations with charged moving grains are on the brink of or beyond contemporary computer capabilities .",
    "thus , we adopt here a following toy model of the aerosol component absorbing the ambient gas .",
    "the dust component consists of spherical rotating grains with variable mass and , consequently , size and moment of inertia .",
    "every atom hitting the grain surface is absorbed by it , transferring therefore , its momentum , changing the mass of the grain and its angular velocity .",
    "the process is inelastic since a part of projectile atom energy is spend for heating the grain surface .",
    "it is assumed that the size of grains is small compared to the mean free path of the ambient gas , however the gas distribution generally depends on the dust component .",
    "our main finding is that although there is no stationary state of this system , the average kinetic and rotational energies of dust eventually tend to certain fixed values , which differ from each other and the temperature of the ambient gas .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ scoll ] we discuss the process of the elementary collision .",
    "microscopic phase densities and corresponding equations generalizing newtonian dynamics are introduced in sec .",
    "[ smpd ] , the latter are used in sec .",
    "[ sfp ] to derive the fokker - planck equation ( [ fp ] ) describing the evolution of the dust distribution . in sec .",
    "[ stemp ] we obtain the homogeneous solution of the fokker - planck equation and evaluate the effective temperatures .",
    "the numeric algorithms are described in sec .",
    "[ salg ] , then we discuss various laws of collision used for simulations ( sec .",
    "[ sncoll ] ) .",
    "the results of simulations , which are in fairly good agreement with analytical theory , are summarized in sec .",
    "we consider the dust component consisting of a number of spherical grains of variable masses , @xmath0 , and of mass dependent radii , @xmath1 .",
    "since we are interested in both translational and rotational degrees of freedom , the state of a grain is described by the ten - dimensional vector , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the grain s linear momentum and @xmath4 is the angular momentum relative its center of inertia , @xmath5 .",
    "the angles describing the rotation are irrelevant due to the sphericity of grains .",
    "the only collision process taken into account is the absorption of an ambient gas by grains , i.e. , every atom colliding a grain is assumed to attach to the grain surface transferring its linear momentum , angular momentum and mass .",
    "we assume that the process of collision elapses in two stages . at the first stage the atom attaches to the grain surface .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 be the projectile atom coordinate and , respectively , the momentum at the instant of collision ; evidently , @xmath8 .",
    "the net angular momentum of the projectile atom and the grain prior to the collision is written as @xmath9 , while after the collision @xmath10 . since after the attachment",
    "the center of inertia of the grain changes @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the conservation of angular momentum requires that @xmath13 it should be noted that both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are independent of the reference frame .    in what follows",
    "we combine the above expressions in the convenient short - hand notation for the process of collision : @xmath16 the leap of the center of inertia ( [ ci ] ) results in the non - conservative character of the mapping ( [ cons ] ) : one can easily verify that its jacobian    @xmath17    is less than unity .    strictly speaking , the attachment of the atom to the grain surface makes the new composite grain non - spherical . to avoid complications with non - spherical grains we assume that at the second stage of the collision some inner forces redistribute the grain mass in such a way that the grain shapes into a sphere .",
    "evidently , this does not alter the grain phase variable , @xmath18 .",
    "although this assumption seems a fairly natural simplification , it may result in non - physical behaviour because it leaves out the energy required for the mass redistribution .",
    "evidently , the process ( [ cons ] ) is inelastic , that is , a part of the net mechanical energy is spent for heating the grain surface , which evidently should be positive .",
    "( the grain heating is of importance if one is going to consider the aerosol processes like thermophoresis . )",
    "abandoning for a moment the presumption of sphericity , the amount of heat released in the asymmetric grain is written as    @xmath19\\right)_i i^{\\prime -1}_{ij } \\left(\\bm { g}+\\tilde{m } [ \\bm { \\rho}\\times\\bm { v}]\\right)_j   \\right\\ } , \\label{energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 is the atom velocity in the grain reference frame , @xmath21 is the reduced mass , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the grain tensors of inertia prior and , respectively , after the collision . expanding ( [ energy ] ) in powers of the small mass ratio , @xmath25 , we obtain that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the grain angular velocity . in other words ,",
    "the energy conservation does not debar the mass absorption .",
    "on the other hand , assuming the grain shapes into a sphere , the tensor of inertia is isotropic and depends on the grain mass only , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and analyzing eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) one can find that @xmath30 is always positive if @xmath31 .",
    "however , it is easy to verify for an arbitrary spherically - symmetric mass distribution that the latter inequality never holds .",
    "this means that some energy is required for the grain to shape into a sphere and there exist a certain range of impact parameters , such that the available mechanical energy is insufficient for the mass redistribution .",
    "it should be noted that similar phenomena are also known in nuclear physics ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "simple estimation shows that the assumption of sphericity results in the violation of the energy conservation for atoms moving with characteristic velocities of the order of @xmath32 . in the following",
    "we assume that the energy of rotation is of the order of the gas temperature and the mass ratio , @xmath25 , is small , _ i.e. _ the discussed effect is relevant for a very small group of projectile atoms with velocity less than @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the gas thermal velocity .",
    "we ignore the influence of deviation from sphericity for this reason .",
    "nonetheless , the discussed effect may play an important role for small clusters and , perhaps , it explains the complex structure of fine grains grown in a gas discharge .      in order to obtain the desired kinetic equation describing the grain motion we generalize the well - known klimontovich approach @xcite . to describe the whole system the microscopic phase densities",
    "are introduced :    @xmath35    where the indices @xmath36 and @xmath37 are used to enumerate grains and atoms , respectively .",

    "the following kinetic coefficients are introduced : @xmath71 and @xmath72 is given by eq .",
    "( [ vel ] ) .",
    "the physical meaning of the most of the coefficients ( [ coefs ] ) and corresponding terms in eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) is fairly obvious .",
    "@xmath73 is the mass flow at the grain surface , the last term in eq .",

    "the term proportional to @xmath77 is just the archimedean force in a non - uniform gas .",
    "since in the process of collision the angular momentum transferred to the grain is independent of its angular velocity , there is no drag torque analogous to the first term in eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) .",
    "this is the evident consequence of the adopted model .",
    "the drag torque may appear if one takes into account the non - sphericity of grains or inelastic scattering of atoms by the grain surface . within the present model the drag torque is provided by spatial gradients and it is characterized by the coefficient @xmath78 . since in the low velocity limit , @xmath79",
    ", @xmath78 is proportional to @xmath74 , the drag torque may appear if the curl of the drag force is non - zero .    of interest",
    "is the term proportional to @xmath80 in eq .",

    "it is non - vanishing if the grain moves relative to the ambient gas and arises due to the change of the center of inertia in the process of collision ( [ ci ] ) or , in other words , @xmath80 describes the migration of the center of inertia due to the asymmetric bombardment of the grain by gas atoms . comparing the left - hand side of ( [ eqd ] ) with this term",
    "we see that @xmath80 appears as an addition to the grain velocity , @xmath81 .",
    "it often happens that the ambient medium impose some forces at the particulate , an example is the drag force , @xmath74 . in this case",

    "we face with the example of the first newton s law altered by the ambient gas .    by",
    "the order of magnitude the drag force , @xmath74 , is proportional to @xmath82 , the effective torque , @xmath83 , all other coefficients are of the order of @xmath84 .    in the lowest - order approximation the kinetics of the gas component",
    "is reduced to the absorption .",
    "the corresponding kinetic equation is readily obtained from eq .",

    "now we introduce the translational temperature , @xmath111 , and the rotational temperature , @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the moment of inertia of a grain .",
    "hereafter we will ignore the dependence of the normalized energy , @xmath36 , on @xmath97 : this will be the case of particular examples discussed below .",
    "then , as it follows from ( [ deltat ] ) the translational temperature tends to a fixed value @xmath114    the asymptotic value of the rotational temperature is determined by the dependence of its moment of inertia on the mass , i.e. , by the inner structure of a grain . of interest",
    "are two cases .",
    "suppose that the grain radius is independent of its mass : this will be referred to as a spongy grain .",
    "then , @xmath115 and eq .",
    "( [ deltar ] ) results in @xmath116    another case is a solid or , more general , a fractal grain with @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is its fractal dimension .",
    "since the mass density is proportional to @xmath119 , the moment of inertia is @xmath120    it should be noted that strictly speaking our derivation of kinetic equations is applicable to solid ( @xmath121 ) grains only",
    ". however , the rotational temperature for fractal grains turns out to be independent of the fractal dimension :    @xmath122    now we turn to evaluation of the normalized energy , @xmath36 ( [ eps ] ) . although generally the solution of the kinetic equation ( [ abs ] ) is time - dependent and can deviate from the maxwellian distribution , there are reasons to ignore this deviation .",
    "suppose as an example , that the collision term @xmath123 in eq .",
    "( [ abs ] ) is represented by a sum of the boltzmann integral describing interatomic collisions and let s assume some source term balancing the gas loss .",
    "then , with the dominating role of elastic interatomic collisions , the deviation from maxwellian distribution becomes negligible .",
    "assuming that @xmath124 is the maxwellian distribution with the temperature @xmath125 , we get @xmath126 , i.e.    @xmath127    of interest is that the kinetic dust temperature obtained under the same approximations but in neglecting the mass growth @xcite is @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , the mass growth results in appreciable cooling of the dust component .    at lower gas pressure the interatomic collisions are negligible and we have to take into account the deviation of the ambient gas distribution from maxwellian .",
    "suppose there is some bulk source of the maxwellian gas , i.e. @xmath123 in eq .",
    "( [ abs ] ) is given by @xmath129    assuming that the rate of the dust mass growth ( [ mu ] ) is smaller than the rate of gas creation , i.e. , @xmath130 , we neglect the time derivative in ( [ abs ] ) , that results in    @xmath131    where @xmath132 .",
    "obviously , this distribution differs from maxwellian due to the accumulation of slow atoms .",
    "evaluating the integrals we get @xmath133 , that is , in the case of high dust density    @xmath134    the main results of this section may be summarized as follows .",
    "the momentum distribution of the dust component absorbing the ambient gas tends to maxwellian .",
    "although the average value of momenta are always growing , the corresponding temperatures tend to certain fixed values , which differ from each other",
    ". moreover , the rotational temperature depends on the inner structure of dust grains .    in ignoring the mass growth , _",
    "i.e. , _ the last term in eq .",
    "( [ fpi ] ) , the dust translational temperature in the maxwellian gas tends to @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "however , due to the absence of the friction torque within the adopted model , there is no steady behaviour with respect to the rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "these conclusions were gathered assuming the mass dispersion is negligible .",
    "however , the same inferences also follow from the general non - stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ fpi ] ) , which may be obtained in a similar way but is too cumbersome to be adduced here .",
    "the simulations of the brownian kinetics of a single grain were performed in a following way . the computational area was a three - dimensional cube of unit length on edge in contact with unbounded equilibrium gas .",
    "this contact was simulated by point atoms of unit mass , which were randomly injected inside the cube from all of its faces and could freely leave the computational area . for each atom leaving the cube , another atom with the random velocity",
    "was injected from the random point of the random cube face .",
    "the distribution function of the injected atoms was semi - maxwellian .",
    "it was verified that in the absence of dust grains the bulk distribution inside the cube was maxwellian with the prescribed temperature , @xmath125 .",
    "the average number of atoms depended on the thermal velocity ; in most runs it fluctuated around 10000 .",
    "since there were no forces acting upon atoms , their trajectories were straight lines .",
    "the grain was represented by a movable sphere of a radius small compared to the cube edge , typically , the initial size was @xmath136 .",
    "if an atom hit the grain surface then it transferred a part of its momenta to the grain according to some prescribed rules , which are discussed below . in the case of absorbing grain ,",
    "no new atom was injected into the cube after the collision , that resulted in some reduction of density .",
    "since the grain was initially small , a very little part of atoms could actually experience the collision .",
    "the equations of motion for both translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the grain were solved ; the time step was small compared to the average time between the collisions .",
    "it was observed that some spurious force arose when the grain approached the faces of the cube . to minimize the influence of this computational effect the grain was confined near the center of the cube with the help of the auxiliary spherically - symmetric parabolic potential well .",
    "the parameters of the well were chosen in such a way that even with the kinetic energy of about 100 @xmath125 the grain could not approach the faces of the cube .",
    "evidently , such a confinement should result in multiplication of the grain distribution by a boltzmannian factor and could not alter the distribution over the kinetic energy .",
    "moreover , in application to the dusty plasma the confinement appears in a natural way . the imposed auxiliary potential did not influence the motion of atoms .",
    "it is worth noting that although the mass of the grain could be as large as several millions of atom masses , its mobility was crucial for our simulations .",
    "it was the temptation to avoid the solution of the grain equations of motion by simply counting down the energy and momentum transferred to the immobile grain .",
    "however , this way led nowhere : the grain temperature was permanently increasing without any saturation .",
    "the main goal of our simulations was to accumulate enough data in order to reconstruct the grain distribution function over its kinetic and rotational energy .",
    "the translational or rotational energy axis , say , @xmath137 , was split in a number of sub - bands ( usually , 50 ) .",
    "two methods of averaging were used .",
    "first , we could trace the energy variation of a single grain and evaluate the time it spent in each energy sub - band .",
    "then , these time intervals were summed up resulting in time - averaged distribution function .",
    "another method of averaging was the simulation of the canonical gibbs ensemble .",
    "initially , the grain was situated at the center of the cube , its rotational and kinetic energies were chosen randomly using the random - number generators of maxwellian distributions with corresponding initial kinetic , @xmath138 , and rotational , @xmath139 , temperatures . the evolution of the grain energies was recorded for the time period @xmath140 .",
    "the obtained dependence represented a single sample from the gibbs ensemble .",
    "the whole procedure was repeated many times with varied random initial energies but the same initial temperatures . by counting down a number of samples in each energy sub - band for a given time instant we were able to reconstruct the time evolution of the energy distribution function .",
    "it should be noted that reconstruction of the distribution over both kinetic and rotational energies , @xmath141 requires too many samples or too long integration time . for this reason we could evaluate only the distribution over kinetic , @xmath142 , or rotational , @xmath143 , energy separately .",
    "as it was mentioned , for test ( and fun ) purposes we have used various laws of interaction of an atom with the grain surface",
    ".    _ specular reflections . _",

    "( [ mu ] ) , @xmath160 , where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the initial grain mass and radius , respectively .",
    "the averaging was performed over the ensemble consisting of 1000 samples .",
    "there was the sharp drop in translational temperature evolution at the beginning of the computation .",
    "it originated due to the parabolic potential well , in which the grain was kept .",
    "initially the grain was situated at the bottom of the well , so its potential energy was zero .",
    "then , according to the virial theorem , half of its kinetic energy transferred to the potential one . since the potential well did not influence the grain rotation",
    ", there was no rotational energy drop .",
    "eventually the dust translational temperature tends to @xmath163 , that is , near the value given by eqs .",
    "( [ trm ] ) .",
    "the rotational temperature is also close to the value ( [ rotm ] ) .",
    "since there was only one small grain , the distribution of projectile atoms was essentially maxwellian and we were unable to reproduce the solutions ( [ tra ] ) and ( [ rota ] ) .    the simulations with the `` cold grain '' also confirmed the analytical solution : the translational temperature tends to @xmath164 while the rotational temperature is always growing .",
    "although the simple model of the atom - grain inelastic collisions accepted in this paper ignores some essential processes , it demonstrates many interesting features .",
    "we confirmed that the translational temperature of the dust component differs from the temperature of the ambient gas .",
    "however , we demonstrated that the `` equilibrium '' temperature is highly sensitive to the details of the inelastic collision .",
    "in particular , taking into account the grain mass growth results in appreciable reduction of the dust temperature . it should be noted that the difference between various collision laws discussed above numerically is very small .",
    "the discrepancies in energy balance of the order of a fraction of a tiny mass ratio are accumulated and eventually result in considerable effect .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the rotational temperature is sensitive even to the details of the inner structure of grain .",
    "the important lesson , which may be drawn from the above discussion , is that there is no thermodynamic equilibrium between dust and ambient gas .",
    "the statement itself is fairly evident since a dusty plasma is an open system .",
    "however , this indicates the inapplicability of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which is the basement of the langevin approach to the theory of brownian motion .",
    "therefore , the problem of deducing the langevin equation applicable to dusty plasmas arises .",
