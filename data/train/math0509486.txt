    "the case of @xmath110 is covered by the classical siegel - weil formula . in that case",
    "@xmath111 is given by eisenstein series whereas in our case @xmath79 is a space of cusp forms .",
    "one similarity between our result and the siegel weil formula is that in the classical case , the theta integral attached to @xmath14 is identified with an explicit eisenstein series constructed from @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , we are able to construct a function @xmath11 from @xmath14 and identify the theta lift attached to @xmath14 with a theta lift attached to @xmath13 .",
    "this is made precise in the following    [ matching ] suppose that @xmath112 and corresponding @xmath113 are as in the main theorem .",
    "then there is a unique map @xmath114 such that @xmath115 for all @xmath116 .",
    "more explicitly , for factorizable functions @xmath117 the map @xmath118 is given by @xmath119 where @xmath120 is defined on @xmath121 by @xmath122    we will say that the pair of functions @xmath123 in theorem [ matching ] are matching . in fact theorem [ main ] follows from theorem [ matching ] and the later is proved via a matching of whittaker functions .",
    "it turns out that in our case , the automorphic form @xmath7 is distinguished @xcite , i.e. , involves only one square class of fourier coefficients @xmath124 .",
    "that square class is the one where @xmath125 , and @xmath126 note that although many authors ( e.g. gelbart and piatetski shapiro @xcite for @xmath127 and vignras , for classical automorphic forms , ) proved that `` distinguished automorphic forms come from @xmath21 '' , their results do not apply in our case .    the automorphic forms in @xmath128 are also distinguished .",
    "for any @xmath11 the fourier expansion of @xmath10 is @xmath129 where , in fact , @xmath130 .    to establish theorem [ matching ] for a given @xmath14 it suffices to construct @xmath13 such that @xmath131 for all @xmath116 .",
    "thus the problem of matching reduces to a problem of matching the whittaker functions @xmath132 then , we are reduced to the problem of local matching : given @xmath133 , find @xmath134 such that @xmath135 for all @xmath136 .",
    "the analysis of the local matching depends on the bruhat decomposition @xmath137 in the following way .",
    "the equality in equation for @xmath138 determines @xmath120 uniquely for @xmath139 by the formula @xmath140 there are then two issues .",
    "first we must show that @xmath13 defined on @xmath121 as in equation can be extended to a schwartz function on @xmath25 .",
    "then , with this schwartz function @xmath141 , we must show that the equality in holds on the big cell @xmath142 as well and hence on all of @xmath143 .",
    "the calculation that establishes the local matching on the big cell amounts to establishing an identity involving orbital integrals , gauss sums and weil indexes .    for the global identity",
    "we must also check the fundamental lemma which says that , in the unramified situation , the standard unramified vector @xmath144 is matched by the standard unramified vector @xmath145 .",
    "one technical point which should be noted is that the usual theta correspondence is between @xmath16 and @xmath1 whereas we have only discussed automorphic characters of @xmath146 .",
    "however , in our situation , @xmath147 where @xmath148 and this product allows us to extend our results to @xmath16 .",
    "for an automorphic character @xmath149 of @xmath150 , let @xmath151 where @xmath152 the space @xmath153 is the usual theta lift of the automorphic character @xmath154 of @xmath16 and as a consequence of our calculation we can determine it .",
    "[ ue ] there is a unique character @xmath149 of @xmath150 such that @xmath155 and @xmath156 for @xmath157 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath158 with @xmath159    a final note about the type of representation we get is that the local representations coming from @xmath21 which we match are the irreducible even or odd components of the weil representation for a one dimensional quadratic space .",
    "in fact , what we show is that , when @xmath160 , then in the local matching , @xmath161 is matched by an even @xmath162 and , when @xmath163 , then @xmath161 is matched by an odd @xmath162 .",
    "this means that the local component @xmath164 of @xmath128 is the image of the irreducible representation of @xmath1 on either the space of even schwartz functions @xmath165 or the space of odd schwartz functions @xmath166 according to the invariant of @xmath23 . by theorem",
    "[ matching ] the local component @xmath167 of @xmath79 coincides with @xmath164 .",

    ".    in @xcite waldspurger considers the space @xmath168 which is the orthogonal complement in @xmath169 to the representation coming from @xmath21 which he calls the elementary weil representations .",
    "these elementary representations are exactly the ones that correspond to @xmath79 in our case and so our result complements the classification carried out by waldspurger .",

    "it is also known ( e.g. gelbart @xcite ) that since @xmath3 is a split space , then in fact @xmath759 .",
    "furthermore , the composition series of @xmath760 has length two , it has a unique irreducible submodule and a unique irreducible quotient .    in @xcite , waldspurger analyzed the two factors in the composition series .",
    "his result is that the unique quotient is @xmath761 : the local theta correspondence of the trivial character from @xmath5 ( which waldspurger denotes by @xmath762 . )",
    "this unique quotient has a @xmath351 whittaker model whereas the unique irreducible submodule of @xmath760 ( which waldspurger denotes by @xmath763 has whittaker models for all square classes of characters @xmath764 except for @xmath351 ( lemma 3 on p 227 in @xcite ) .    since @xmath744 factors through @xmath765",
    "there is a map @xmath766 and by considering the whittaker models we see that @xmath767 and so @xmath768 .",
    "i.e. @xmath769 is the unique irreducible quotient of @xmath760 which is isomorphic to @xmath761 , that is @xmath770 .",
    "the argument splits into three cases handled separately in the next subsections .",
    "[ [ chicircnu - is - trivial - on - ensuremathrm - oensuremathtextup - vensuremathmathbbr . ] ] @xmath57 is trivial on @xmath771 . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    throughout this subsection , @xmath25 will be isomorphic to @xmath772 and we will pick a particular realizations of the matrix algebra and division algebra such that @xmath773 when @xmath9 is nontrivial and @xmath774 when @xmath9 is trivial .",
    "we will not mention these conditions in the statements of the lemmas , but they should be understood to be stated with respect to these choices of @xmath300 . since the equality we will establish is defined independently of a particular realization",
    "there is no loss of generality .",
    "the cases included in this subsection are the case of @xmath775 ( which by lemma [ ramtriv ] , can only exist when @xmath23 is the matrix algebra ) and the case @xmath19 and @xmath23 is the division algebra ( in which case @xmath776 so @xmath777 ) . note that in both cases , once we know that we can match all the forms coming from the representation of @xmath778 , by lemma [ par2 ] , the parity of all @xmath779 can be assumed to be even .",
    "hence only the trivial extension of @xmath267 to @xmath771 will have a nonzero lift .",
    "this is the reason for describing both cases in this subsection as the case of @xmath57 trivial on @xmath771 .",
    "the matching in this case will be established by the matching of the whittaker functions corresponding to the gaussians and using the fact that the the space @xmath780 is generated by the image of the gaussians .",
    "the matching of the gaussians will depend on calculating their @xmath549-types and using the iwasawa decomposition to conclude that the two whittaker functions agree on all of @xmath631 . the main argument is contained in the following theorem .",
    "[ archimatch ] let @xmath9 be a the trivial character when @xmath23 is a matrix algebra or the nontrivial character when @xmath23 is the division algebra .",
    "then @xmath781 and for any @xmath782 we have and @xmath783 .",
    "as explained above , in this case the characters extend to the trivial character on @xmath747 .",
    "therefore , as mentioned in @xcite , it follows from a result of howe @xcite that @xmath737 is generated by the image of the gaussian : @xmath404 .",
    "the calculation that we carry out in this proof will show that if @xmath14 is the gaussian then @xmath783 and therefore @xmath784 . therefore , for any @xmath14 , there is some @xmath785 such that @xmath786 and by lemma [ bmatch ] we know that @xmath787 must be @xmath13 .",
    "this would also show that the formula for @xmath13 defines a schwartz function in the restricted schwartz space .",
    "the second result is a consequence of lemma [ par2 ] , which implies that the space @xmath738 is the image of the irreducible representation on even functions @xmath788 so it is also irreducible and @xmath781 .    by the above argument",
    ", the calculation that remains is to show that when @xmath14 is the gaussian we have @xmath783 . by lemma [ weights ] we know that for all elements of @xmath789 we have @xmath790 and @xmath791 for some @xmath346 .",
    "as we mentioned above we picked a realization of the algebras with @xmath796 when @xmath9 is nontrivial or trivial , respectively . by lemma [ setm ] , this means that we must choose the quadratic form on @xmath5 to be @xmath797 and @xmath798 respectively .",
    "the lie group @xmath549 is connected so its representation is determined by the action of the lie algebra .",
    "this lie algebra is generated by the element @xmath801 so it will be enough to calculate the actions of @xmath802 to show that the actions of the whole algebra are the same .",
    "we denote the lie algebra action of @xmath803 and @xmath246 by @xmath804 and @xmath805 , respectively . instead of calculating the action of @xmath802 directly , we write @xmath806 with @xmath807 and calculate the following actions @xmath808 and @xmath809 on @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath810 and @xmath811 the rest of the proof is a lengthy but standard calculus computation .",
    "just as an illustration of the type of calculation involved we calculate the action on @xmath14 when @xmath9 is trivial . in this case",
    "the gaussian is the function @xmath812 and we calculate the first term in the action of @xmath802 . @xmath813 we now calculate the second term in the action of @xmath802 .",
    "@xmath814 the last step uses a lemma ( which is also omitted ) which says that the gaussian is an eigenfunction of @xmath642 with eigenvalue @xmath815 .",
    "@xmath816 to continue the calculation we let @xmath817 and then @xmath818 using standard formulas from calculus and integrating with respect to the self dual measure @xmath819 so that @xmath820 adding up equation and we get the action of @xmath802 on the gaussian @xmath821    [ [ chicirc - nu - is - nontrivial - on - ensuremathtextup - hensuremathmathbbr . ] ] @xmath267 is nontrivial on @xmath822 . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
    "the remaining archimedean case is the case of a nontrivial @xmath9 and @xmath23 is a matrix algebra . the argument that will show matching is similar to the one for the other real cases .",
    "we will use the fact that the representation is known to be irreducible and the matching of one function to conclude that the whittaker spaces of @xmath737 and @xmath738 coincide .        since in this case the quadratic space @xmath3 is split with signature ( 2,1 ) we can use a theorem of zhu , ( 1.2 in @xcite ) which says that in this case , when @xmath826 , @xmath827 . by lemma [ archimatch ]",
    "we know that @xmath828 is irreducible and therefore so is @xmath737 .",
    "we will show that when @xmath14 is the gaussian then @xmath723 , this would mean that the whittaker spaces are equal and by lemma [ bmatch ] it follows that for any @xmath420 we have , @xmath723 .",
    "it will also follow that @xmath13 is actually a function in the restricted schwartz space of @xmath829 .",
    "as in the proof of theorem [ archimatch ] it will be enough to show that when @xmath14 is the gaussian then @xmath14 and @xmath13 are of the same k - type .",
    "this is done in lemma [ weights2 ] and completes the argument .",
    "the local data in the complex case is as simple as possible .",
    "since every complex number is a square , the quadratic character @xmath831 is trivial .",
    "for the same reason , the quaternion algebra is ramified i.e. @xmath160 .",
    "the correspondence in this case can be deduced from known facts without any additional calculation . in @xcite ( proposition 2.1 ) adams and barbasch show that the theta lift of the trivial character from @xmath830 to @xmath832 is isomorphic to the irreducible representation @xmath833 which is the weil representation of @xmath832 on @xmath834- the space of even schwartz functions .    if @xmath835 is the automorphic form in the theta lift of the character @xmath57 extended trivially from @xmath836 to @xmath830 defined similarly to @xmath7 then @xmath837 .",
    "therefore , @xmath838 and to conclude the matching of functions we need to show that the spaces of functions @xmath79 and @xmath128 actually coincide .",
    "this follows from the multiplicity one of spherical representations of @xmath832 .",
    "the fact that the representations are spherical is verified by the existence of the gaussian functions in both representations .",
    "therefore , the matching for the actual function is given by the formula for @xmath13 ."
