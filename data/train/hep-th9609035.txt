    "the non - linear @xmath0 @xmath1-model in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional space - time is a scalar field theory whose target space is @xmath3 .",
    "the static fields are maps @xmath4 and can be classified by a homotopy invariant which is called the hopf number .",
    "such a model in three space dimensions must include higher order terms in the field gradient in order to allow non - singular , topologically non - trivial , static solutions . the corresponding `` sigma model with a skyrme term ''",
    "was proposed long ago by l.d .",
    "faddeev @xcite . for this model",
    "the hopf number provides a lower topological bound on the energy @xcite .",
    "early studies on `` hopfions '' ( soliton solutions of hopf number unity ) in classical field theory , including estimates for their size and mass , were carried out by de  vega@xcite .",
    "subsequently it was suggested to employ them in an effective chiral theory describing low - energy hadron dynamics ; in that respect they are similar to skyrmions @xcite .",
    "it was later shown by kundu and rybakov @xcite that hopfions in the @xmath0 @xmath1-model are of closed vortex type .",
    "models with non - zero hopf number have also been investigated in condensed matter physics for the description of three - dimensional ferromagnets and superfluid @xmath5he@xcite .",
    "these are effective theories of ginzburg - landau type where the fields are interpreted as physical order parameters .",
    "however , a field configuration which is a solution of the full equations of motion has not been found for any of the mentioned theories .    in this paper",
    "we mainly study classical static hopfions .",
    "our model is defined in section [ hmaps ] where also an ansatz of azimuthal symmetry is introduced which is later used for numerical computations . in section [ nres ]",
    "we present our numerical results which are minima of the energy functional for hopf number one and two .",
    "we discuss their shapes and binding energies as well as their relation to ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional solitons .",
    "our model has a self - interaction coupling parameter and we study the dependence of the energy on this coupling .",
    "in addition , the effect of a symmetry breaking potential term is described . in section [ srot ]",
    "we give a simple approximation for the excitation spectrum of a hopfion slowly rotating around its axis of symmetry .",
    "we conclude with section [ conc ] where we",
    "we are almost exclusively interested in static solutions and therefore define our model by the following energy functional on @xmath6 @xmath7 = \\lambda\\int_{{\\bbb r}^3 } d{\\bf x}\\ ; \\frac{1}{2 } \\left(\\partial_i \\bbox{\\phi } \\right)^2 + \\frac{g_1}{8}\\left(\\partial_i \\bbox{\\phi }   \\times \\partial_j \\bbox{\\phi } \\right)^2 + \\frac{g_2}{8}\\left(\\partial_i \\bbox{\\phi } \\right)^2 \\left ( \\partial_j \\bbox{\\phi}\\right)^2 \\,.\\ ] ] for @xmath8 this is equivalent to the static energy of the faddeev - skyrme model @xcite .",
    "the field @xmath9 is a three component vector in iso - space , subject to the constraint @xmath10 .",
    "the cross product is taken in internal space and the coordinate indices @xmath11 run from 1 to 3 .    for @xmath12 minima of @xmath13 ( eq .  ( [ en ] ) ) are harmonic maps from @xmath6 to @xmath14 as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , all non - constant harmonic maps are orthogonal projections @xmath15 , followed by a harmonic map @xmath16 and therefore have infinite energy .    consistently ,",
    "simple scaling arguments along the line of the hobart - derrick theorem @xcite show that the fourth order terms in the energy functional are required to stabilize the soliton against shrinkage .",
    "we include here the most general combination of global @xmath0-invariant fourth order terms .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is a constant of dimension energy / length and determines the models energy unit .",
    "the couplings @xmath18 and @xmath19 are of dimension ( length)@xmath20 the ratio @xmath21 is the only physically relevant coupling since an overall scaling of @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be absorbed by a rescaling of length and energy units . using @xmath22",

    "thus @xmath6 can be one - point compactified to @xmath30 and the fields @xmath9 are maps @xmath31 because @xmath32 , every @xmath9 falls into a class of topologically equivalent maps , where each class is characterized by an integer : the hopf number @xmath33 .",

    "alternatively , a closed vortex ansatz in toroidal coordinates was suggested @xcite .",

    "which configuration represents the true ground state we computed their energies and found that the configuration with @xmath121 yields the lower energy for all couplings .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath118 solutions in terms of a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional soliton / anti - soliton pair is equivalent to the one given above for the 1-hopfion . because the multiplicity of the azimuthal rotation is @xmath122 for the 2-hopfion , the anti - baby skyrmion in the negative @xmath108-halfplane ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) has a relative angle of @xmath110 compared to the anti - baby skyrmion of fig .",
    "it is instructive to investigate how the inclusion of a potential term @xmath123 $ ] alters the configuration .",
    "its energy can be lowered by rescaling * x * @xmath124*x * , ( @xmath125 ) under which @xmath126 .",
    "this means that the potential term induces a `` shrinkage '' of the configuration in the sense that the favoured position of the fields is closer to their vacuum value .",

    "the tube - like region where the field is in the southern hemisphere has clearly shrunk . adding a linear potential term also means that the fields fall off exponentially at large distances .",
    "the reason is that the equations of motion become in the asymptotic limit those of the massive klein - gordon equation .",
    "the fields of minimal energy correspond , via eq .",
    "( [ en ] ) , to energy distributions which are displayed in fig .  2 .",
    "despite the toroidal structure of the fields , we find that the energy for the hopfion of @xmath130 is lump - shaped , see fig .",
    "although unexpected , this is not entirely unlikely , because the field changes far more rapidly within the disc @xmath131 than outside it .",
    "hence the gradient energy can be concentrated in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "if the potential term becomes very large compared to the gradient terms one expects the energy to become more localized around the filament where the fields are far away from the vacuum .",
    "we observe this transition to a toroidal energy distribution at @xmath132 for @xmath133    the energy distribution of the 2-hopfion is of toroidal shape ( for all @xmath127 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "it is a common feature in many soliton theories that solutions of topological charge two are tori , notably skyrmions , baby skyrmions and magnetic monopoles .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the 2-hopfion is in a stable state or likely to decay into two hopfions of charge one . as an estimate for short range interactions",
    "one can compare the energy per hopfion for the solution of @xmath130 and @xmath118 and conclude from the sign of the energy gap whether there is a repulsive or attractive channel .",
    "our results are plotted in fig .",
    "3(a ) , which also shows the topological bound eq .",
    "( [ topbound ] ) . for a pure skyrme coupling",
    "we obtain energies of @xmath134 and @xmath135 for the 1-hopfion and 2-hopfion respectively .",
    "moreover , it turns out that for all couplings the 2-hopfion has a lower energy per topological unit than the 1-hopfion .",
    "this indicates that there is a range where the forces are attractive and that the 2-hopfion can be stable at least under small perturbations .",
    "of course , there can be a range in which the forces are repulsive , however , an investigation of such interactions would require a full ( 3 + 1)-dimensional simulation which is beyond our present means . also note that the gap between the energies per hopfion is largest when the fourth order terms are purely the skyrme term . on the other hand , for @xmath136 ,",
    "( i.e. @xmath137 the energy of the quartic terms tends to zero .",
    "hence the energy of the soliton vanishes as a consequence of the above mentioned hobart - derrick theorem .",
    "finally , we study the effect of a slow rotation around the axis of symmetry . for this",
    "we use a lorentz - invariant extension of our model into ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional space - time . the energy of the rotating hopfion @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the static energy given by eq .",

    "physically one may think of them as a model for hadronic matter or topological defects in a condensed matter system . by using a general ansatz for the fields we obtained explicit numerical solutions for soliton number one and two .",
    "unexpectedly , the energy of the 1-hopfion is distributed as a lump .",
    "we also observed that two solitons sitting on top of each other attract , thus indicating a stable configuration .",
    "there are several interesting questions which remain unanswered .",
    "in particular , the stability of hopfions of higher topological charge deserves some scrutiny .",
    "it is worthwhile asking how multi - solitons which sit on top of each other , or at least are very close , behave under induced perturbations . in analogy",
    "to planar @xmath0 @xmath1-models there might be several decay channels into less symmetric configurations @xcite .    at the opposite end of the scale ,",
    "it would be instructive to look in greater detail at the interaction potential of two or more well - separated hopfions .",
    "this is also interesting in comparison to the well - studied dynamics of skyrmions and monopoles .",
    "clearly , a first step in such an investigation would be to determine the asymptotic fields of the hopf soliton .",
    "it seems obvious that inter - soliton forces will depend on the orientation of the hopfions .",
    "the complete description of hopfion dynamics would require a huge numerical effort which can , however , possibly be reduced by an appropriate approximation scheme . for bogomolnyi solitons ,",
    "the low - energy behaviour can be approximated via the truncation of the dynamics to the moduli space .",
    "although our numerical results show that hopfions are not of bogomolnyi type , given that the static forces between them are weak , there is a chance that their dynamics can be described by some kind of moduli space approximation , in analogy to skyrmions ( which are also not of bogomolnyi type ) .",
    "finally , it seems worth to study spinning hopfions in a more sophisticated way .",
    "this should include an assessment of the back reaction of the rotation on the matter fields . from this one",
