    "during the last years , plasmonics has become a celebrated field to which deep and intense research is being targeted .",
    "the term plasmon alludes to a collective harmonic movement of electrons@xcite entailed to equally oscillating electromagnetic fields , and was born in the context of studying losses of fast electrons when moving through metallic foils .",
    "@xcite this concept also emerges as the existence of electromagnetic modes at the interface between a metal and a dielectric.@xcite    its popularity lies in both the theoretical and practical interest that its understanding offers . on the one hand , they manifest many - body effects between electrons associated to the long range coulomb interaction;@xcite on the other hand , their striking features , among which their high confinement to the two - dimensional sheet plays a main role , suggest various applications in cutting - edge electronics and optoelectronics.@xcite this altogether enforces the will to extend this exploration to systems of present physical interest that share a challenge in the theoretical aspect with a promise regarding engineering or applied physics .",
    "graphene is one of the most promising candidates.@xcite its two dimensional honeycomb lattice structure leads to an effective low - energy theory which is governed by a spin - independent massless dirac hamiltonian .",
    "the physical implications underlying this fact have been comprehensively studied and spread to a wide extent of different topics.@xcite throughout this article , we are mainly interested in those related to its current current correlation function . in other words , we will continuously allude to the interaction of electrons in graphene with electromagnetic radiation .",
    "some main results covering this aspect have been outlined in ref . .",
    "a constant value for the real part of the conductivity above twice the fermi energy , i.e. , an absorption value equal to 2.3% dependent only on universal constants for any high enough frequency , deserves to be highlighted.@xcite at the same time , several issues still demand further research and suggest that this topic is far from being exhausted . for example , the real part of the conductivity shows a plateau between the intra and interband energy regions@xcite whose numerical value can not yet be accounted for , theoretically.@xcite    the current response function is an indispensable tool to characterize plasmons .",
    "its tensorial character allows its decomposition in two channels : the longitudinal and transverse channel depending on whether the vector potential @xmath4 is parallel or perpendicular to the wave vector @xmath5 .",
    "plasmons arising from each channel correspond to transverse magnetic or transverse electric modes ( tm , te).@xcite those linked to the longitudinal channel have outshined the others , because they are associated to the density response and thus charge accumulation.@xcite there are also several fundamental studies@xcite considering the influence of temperature,@xcite lattice effects,@xcite band gap,@xcite electron - electron interaction@xcite or magnetic fields.@xcite also new plasmon related phenomena have been discussed in double - layer structures , where coulomb interaction between two graphene layers in the strong light matter coupling regime reveals to be the vehicle that tunnels photons through an otherwise forbidden transmission.@xcite    on the other hand , not so much has been clarified about transverse plasmons.@xcite ref .",
    "first spots their existence for the simplest case , namely suspended graphene at zero temperature and making use of the local approximation ( @xmath6 ) for the current current response function .",
    "they consist of another kind of oscillation performed by the electrons : whereas for longitudinal plasmons they move forward and backward along the direction determined by @xmath5 ( and thus involving charge accumulation ) , for transverse plasmons the current oscillates in the perpendicular direction and the density is kept homogeneous in space .    due to their transverse nature",
    ", the dispersion relation is closely pinned to the light cone and they are confined to energies between 1.667 and twice the fermi energy ( for larger energies they are strongly damped).@xcite here , we want to discuss this transverse light matter coupling in more detail , such as the influence exerted by finite temperature , the possibility of inducing transverse plasmons in the undoped graphene sheet , the circumstances that demand the discard of the local approximation for the response function , the changes induced by modifying the dielectric surroundings , the highest spatial confinement within reach or their behavior when sheets are embedded between an optical cavity .    the paper is organized as follows . in the second section ,",
    "we calculate the current current response function at finite temperature and doping for both the longitudinal and transverse channels to count on the fundamental tool to discuss light matter interaction within linear response .",
    "we then analyze the questions mentioned above : i ) effects related to finite temperature .",
    "ii ) effects related to various dielectric media and the necessity of going beyond the local response .",
    "iii ) effects related to placing graphene inside a vertical cavity .",
    "we complement this discussion by calculating the transmissivity of electromagnetic radiation for @xmath1 and @xmath2 polarizations for a single and double layer structure and close with a summary and outlook .",
    "the ( bare ) response function @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) allows us to determine the value of the currents arising in a medium due to the presence of a total ( external ) vector potential @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "that is , as linear response theory states for an homogeneous system , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where@xcite @xmath13 ( an analogous expression is fulfilled for the bare response , with the superscript @xmath14 in every @xmath15 letter , that is omitted above for the sake of simplicity ) and @xmath16\\rangle e^{i\\omega t}e^{-\\epsilon t } , \\label{kubo}\\ ] ] being @xmath17 the total area of the system . from now on ,",
    "every property of the full response function @xmath18 will be shared with the bare one unless the contrary is specified .",
    "@xmath18 is a tensor of the same dimension of the space under study ( 2 in case of graphene ) .",
    "we can choose a reference frame with one axis parallel to any given @xmath5 in such a way that @xmath18 will become diagonal.@xcite in that case , we can decouple the response in two channels : the longitudinal and the transverse one , alluding respectively to @xmath9 being parallel or perpendicular to @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , @xmath19 will provide the result of the longitudinal ( transverse ) component of the response function when @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "moreover , due to invariance with respect to rotations in our model , these components will only depend on @xmath22 .    to calculate @xmath19 for graphene",
    ", we will have to use eq .",
    "( [ kubo ] ) and the fourier transform of the current operator , @xmath23 with @xmath24 containing the pauli matrices .",
    "it is obvious , then , that @xmath25 differing the isospin isospin response function only in a multiplicative factor with respect to the current current one , from now on , we will deal with @xmath26 .",
    "the lehmann representation yields @xmath27 in this expression , we will introduce the wavefunctions @xmath28 and the non interacting fermi statistics , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 corresponds to the upper ( lower ) band and @xmath31 is the angle between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that , by virtue of the continuity equation , the density density and the longitudinal isospin isospin response functions are related , fulfilling @xcite @xmath34\\rangle+\\frac{v_f^2q^2}{\\omega^2}\\chi_{\\sigma_x\\sigma_x}(q\\hat{x},\\omega ) .",

    "these are the main analytical results of this work .",
    "they generalize others as the ones given by refs .",
    ", whose validity is restricted to @xmath49 , or those of ref .",
    ", where only the longitudinal channel ( or , equivalently , the density density response ) is taken into account .",
    "so far , we count on eqs .",
    "( [ reres ] ) and ( [ imres ] ) for the bare current current response .",
    "those formulas deal with the case of independent electrons , that is , they can not manifest the existence of plasmons .",
    "however , by means of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , we can easily obtain a current current response function which takes into account the interaction between electrons . ref .",
    "assures that without neglecting retardation , we can write @xmath50 for both the longitudinal ( @xmath20 ) and transverse ( @xmath21 ) channels knowing the respective propagators @xmath51 and @xmath52 : @xmath53 in turn , @xmath54    the singularities of eq .",
    "( [ chirpa ] ) in the longitudinal ( transverse ) channel will tell when longitudinal ( transverse ) plasmons arise . both correspond to collective current oscillations of the electrons , but the character of the oscillations is quite different due to the parallel ( perpendicular ) direction of their movement with respect to @xmath5 and consequently their ( in)depedence on density fluctuations .    regarding transverse plasmons , the analysis of the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ chirpa ] ) was carried out by ref .",
    ", demonstrating the existence of te modes in graphene .",
    "however , its conclusions are restricted to zero temperature , suspended graphene in vacuum and the local ( @xmath6 ) approximation of the conductivity .    here , we investigate what happens if those simplifications are discarded .",
    "our standpoint will be able to yield the answer to this and many other questions , as outlined in the introduction . in the following sections",
    ", it is our aim to offer a better understanding of te modes in graphene by means of the result for the current current response functions presented in eqs .",
    "( [ reres ] ) and ( [ imres ] ) .      a suitable tool to inquire about",
    "the dispersion relation of plasmons is the loss function , which can be defined as @xmath55 aside from reproducing the singularities of eq .",
    "( [ chirpa ] ) at @xmath49 , it gives information about how they broaden due to damping arising from the bare response ( damping coming , in our case , from electron - hole excitations ) when @xmath56 or whenever @xmath57 .",
    "it is already known that density plasmons hold ( although , of course , damped ) for room temperature @xcite or higher @xcite ( @xmath58 ) in the sense that the loss function is not excessively smeared around the singularity present at @xmath49 .",
    "however , transverse plasmons behave in a different manner regarding this aspect . to demonstrate so , let us focus on figs .",
    "[ lffig1 ] and [ lffig2 ] .",
    "there , we represent the dispersion relation of transverse plasmons at @xmath49 with a solid line , is set equal to 0 for @xmath59 , i.e. outside the pauli blocking zone , where the loss function is really smeared around the solid line plotted because of electron - hole excitations . ] whereas the colors correspond to the values of the loss function at the specified temperature .",
    "it is convenient to plot the difference of frequency with respect to the light cone @xmath60 in units of @xmath61 against the wave vector @xmath62 in units of @xmath63 .",
    "we can see that at very low temperatures , the loss function still suggests the structure of the dispersion relation of transverse plasmons : they are so far well defined .",
    "however , rising @xmath64 to @xmath65 implies that no trace of them is preserved .",
    "this is due to the vicinity of the plasmon dispersion to the region of interband transition and also due to the small spectral weight of the transverse plasmon suppressed by @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "the effect of frequency shifting as a consequence of the influence of @xmath64 is also worthwhile being mentioned.@xcite not only does temperature determine to which extent longitudinal plasmons are damped , but also displaces the dispersion relation towards higher energies . from figs .",
    "[ lffig1 ] and [ lffig2 ] , an analogous result can be inferred for the transverse channel .",
    "nevertheless , here we observe a red instead of a blue shift ; the transverse plasmon thus becomes more localized but finally fades out .",
    "another interesting consideration involving temperature is its ability to induce plasmonic excitations at zero doping .",
    "when @xmath68 and @xmath64 equal 0 , neither electric nor magnetic modes can be present in a graphene layer .",
    "however , finite temperature involves thermally activated electron - hole excitations , allowing longitudinal ( slightly damped ) plasmons to appear.@xcite in fact , the case of @xmath69 and @xmath56 ( @xmath64 being sufficiently low ) can be shown to be equivalent to doped graphene at @xmath49 with the fermi energy @xmath70.@xcite in other words , the role of temperature is equivalent to inducing a nonzero value of doping .",
    "thus basically two forces compete in the context of this mechanism to make plasmons spring up : the excitation of carriers being favorable to their emergence and the increase of damping claiming to make them vanish . whereas in the longitudinal case there are well - defined oscillations",
    ", we find that for transverse plasmons they are completely washed out",
    ". we can understand this by comparing the energy scale set by the temperature @xmath64 with the energy scale given by @xmath71 : @xmath72 since already for @xmath73 there is no clear maximum in the loss function ( see fig .",
    "[ lffig2 ] ) , the scale set by eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) seems too high to induce transverse plasmons at zero doping .",
    "[ lfef0 ] confirms this intuition : the loss function for @xmath74 is completely diluted and does not reproduce the plasmon dispersion relation respective to @xmath49 and a nonzero doping given by @xmath71 .",
    "lowering the temperature even more does not involve any change , which can be expected since eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) is a scale - invariant universal result .",
    "thus , we have reached a remarkable conclusion concerning a difference between transverse and longitudinal plasmons : only the latter can be found at zero doping .    , but for @xmath69 and @xmath74 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to @xmath75 and @xmath49 , with @xmath70 .",
    "the loss function does not lead to any trace of transverse plasmons . ]",
    "it is well known how longitudinal plasmons change their dispersion relation when graphene sheets ( e.g. monolayer and double layer systems ) are embedded between different dielectrics.@xcite however , transverse plasmons do not behave similarly even in the simplest case , that is , a single sheet lying on a substrate .",
    "they exhibit an extreme sensibility to a slight difference in the refractive index of the two surrounding media to the extent of vanishing for @xmath76 at room temperature.@xcite this is due to the fact that the dispersion relation of transverse plasmons is extremely pinned to the light cone , such that when two different light cones exist and are sufficiently separated , they rapidly vanish .    thus to focus on transverse plasmons and inquire about how the dispersion relation can substantially change due to their dielectric surroundings ( permittivity and permeability ) , we will keep the vicinity of the graphene layer homogeneous with the same refractive index @xmath46 . within this constraint",
    ", we can analyze the consequences of modifying @xmath46 .     at @xmath49 for different values of @xmath77 : @xmath78 ( blue ) , @xmath79 ( red ) , @xmath80 ( green ) , @xmath81 ( magenta ) , @xmath82 ( solid black ) and @xmath83 ( dashed ) . ]      increasing the refractive index @xmath46 decreases the speed of light such and as a consequence the light cone is shifted to greater values of @xmath62 for a fixed energy @xmath84 . since the plasmon relation must lie in the evanescent region where @xmath85 , the current current response @xmath86 involved in the present situation must be evaluated at larger @xmath62 . as we mentioned before , previous discussions of the dispersion relation as the one in ref .",
    "would not be valid for high enough values of @xmath46 , since they are only based on the local response ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the relevance of this dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ rechijjqyqgrande ] , where the real part of the transverse current response is shown as a function of the energy for @xmath87 .",
    "the remarkable differences between curves imply significant changes in @xmath88 .",
    "( [ reres ] ) and ( [ imres ] ) will provide us with the ability of characterizing transverse plasmons for high values of the refractive index .",
    "some results are shown in fig .",
    "[ rdqgrande ] , where we focus on undamped plasmons at @xmath49 .",
    "they can be compared to the solid black line of figs .",
    "[ lffig1]-[lfef0 ] , respective to @xmath89 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , as we increase @xmath46 starting from @xmath90 , the highest value of the curves moves further and further away from the light cone ( left hand side of fig .",
    "[ rdqgrande ] ) .",
    "but if we keep up increasing @xmath46 , it turns back ( right hand side of fig .",
    "[ rdqgrande ] ) .",
    "therefore , there is a maximal separation of the dispersion relation from the light cone which determines the fastest decay possible of the fields away from the graphene sheet .",
    "@xcite the confinement of transverse plasmons can thus be increased by a factor of @xmath91 by means of embedding the layer within a dielectric with @xmath0 .    , but for @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the loss function indicates the presence of damped transverse plasmons . ]    regarding now the influence of temperature , there are no substantial differences with respect to the case @xmath89 ( previous section ) . fig .",
    "[ lfqgrande ] represents the loss function , which allows to see how at low temperatures the structure of the dispersion relation of plasmons is maintained .",
    "once again , for @xmath94 , it is completely diluted .",
    "following the reasoning stated in eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) , neither will it be possible to have transverse plasmons for @xmath69 induced by a finite @xmath64 .",
    "density plasmons are an excellent way of enclosing radiation in small regions .",
    "these dimensions just depend on the separation of the dispersion relation from the light cone : the decay length can be written as @xmath95 , with @xmath96.@xcite for energies of the order of @xmath61 , we can neglect retardation effects ( @xmath97 ) , yielding @xmath98 and decay lengths of the order of @xmath99 .    however , once again the situation turns inside out when considering the transverse channel .",
    "the proximity to the light cone implies that @xmath100 ( even its maximum value , which can be estimated from fig . [ rdqgrande ] ) is now much smaller than that of its longitudinal counterpart . for suspended graphene , for example",
    ", we find a minimum value for undamped plasmons of @xmath101 .",
    "it is our aim to address the question of to which extent dodging this limitation is possible and whether confinement can be achieved by relying on a multilayer system .",

    "[ esquema ] ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will set @xmath102 and @xmath103 , but keep the velocity of light constant and equal within the whole sample .",
    "this makes media 1 and 4 impenetrable by @xmath1 polarized electromagnetic waves and one might expect to force a faster decay of the potential vector @xmath104 in @xmath105-direction .        to analyze this problem",

    ". the transverse current current response of graphene arises when attending to the frontier between dielectrics 2 and 3 ( vacuum in our case ) , as well as rpa turns up when writing the surface current as@xcite @xmath109 ( notice the presence of @xmath110 instead of @xmath111 ) .",
    "the resulting system of linear equations for @xmath112 with @xmath113 will have a nontrivial solution only when its determinant is zero ( @xmath114 ) : @xmath115 in that case , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is related to the field amplitude .",
    "let us now define the scale for the decay length . denoting @xmath118 as the retarded wave vector",

    "( [ det ] ) numerically , we find a solution only for layer separation @xmath120 .",
    "thus , transverse plasmons in suspended graphene can be maximally confined to length scales of the order of @xmath121 , still much larger than the previously commented associated to their longitudinal homologous . relaxing the boundary conditions to other values",
    "does not significantly change these conclusions .    for short enough distances",

    "<S> we calculate the linear transverse current current response function for graphene at finite temperature and chemical potential . within the random phase approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we then discuss general aspects of transverse plasmons beyond the local response such as their dependence on temperature and on the surrounding dielectric media . </S>",
    "<S> we find , e.g. , maximal confinement of this mode for a homogeneous dielectric media with refractive index @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> confinement can further be enhanced by placing the graphene sheet inside an optical cavity , but there exists a critical width below which no transverse mode can be sustained . for zero doping and finite temperature , </S>",
    "<S> there are no well - defined transverse plasmonic excitations in contrast to the longitudinal channel . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the absorption of electromagnetic radiation in single and double - layer systems for @xmath1 and @xmath2 polarizations and point out that the theoretical limit of 50% is reached for @xmath1-polarized light with incident angle of @xmath3 . </S>"
