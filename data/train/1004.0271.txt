    "cohn - vossen @xcite studied the gauss - bonnet integral for noncompact complete surface @xmath1 with analytic metrics .",
    "he showed that if the gaussian curvature k is absolutely integrable(in which case we say the manifold has finite total curvature ) , then @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the euler characteristic of m. later , huber @xcite extended this inequality to metrics with much weaker regularity . another nice result he proved",
    "is that such a surface @xmath1 is conformally equivalent to a closed surface with finitely many points removed .",
    "the difference between the two sides of inequality ( [ 1.1 ] ) encodes the asymptotical behavior of the manifold at its ends .",
    "the precise geometric interpretation is given by finn in @xcite : suppose a noncompact complete surface has absolutely integrable gaussian curvature , one may represent each end conformally as @xmath4 for some compact set @xmath5 .",
    "define the asymptotical isoperimetric constant to be @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the euclidean ball centered at origin with radius @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the length of the boundary , and @xmath10 is the area of the domain . as huber @xcite showed in his paper ,",
    "there are only finitely many ends and they are conformally flat , with that finn @xcite proved @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of ends .",
    "this result tells us that if the surface has finite total gaussian curvature , there are rigid geometric and analytical consequences about it .",
    "when @xmath13 chang , qing and yang @xcite get a generalization of ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) by replacing gaussian curvature @xmath5 by paneitz q - curvature .",
    "the @xmath0-curvature comes in naturally as a conformal invariant associated to the fourth order paneitz operator . in order to present their result",
    ", we recall some definitions . in conformal geometry ,",
    "when @xmath13 , the paneitz operator is defined as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the divergence and @xmath16 is the differential .",
    "@xmath17 is the scalar curvature of @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the ricci curvature tensor .",
    "the paneitz q - curvature is defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the traceless part of @xmath19 , and @xmath22 is taken with respect to the metric @xmath18 . under conformal change @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 satisfies the fourth order equation , @xmath26 the invariance of @xmath0-curvature in dimension @xmath27 is due to the chern - gauss - bonnet formula for closed manifold @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the weyl tensor .",
    "the main result proved in @xcite is that suppose @xmath31 is a noncompact complete conformally flat manifold with finite total q - curvature @xmath32 , and suppose the metric is normal(or suppose the scalar curvature @xmath33 is nonnegative at infinity ) , then @xmath34 and @xmath35 here @xmath36 means the euclidean ball with radius @xmath8 at the @xmath37-th end .",
    "the metric is defined to be normal if @xmath38 the normal condition is necessary in higher dimension , because bi - laplacian operator @xmath39 has quadratic functions in its kernel which would give counterexample to ( [ 1.3 ] ) .",
    "the assumption of positive scalar curvature at infinity would imply that the metric is normal for @xmath13 , thus for the purpose of this paper , it can replace the condition of normal metric .",
    "another point is that the result in @xcite is not limited to @xmath13 . by the same argument as that in @xcite",
    ", it is true for all even dimensions if the metric is assumed to be normal . later in @xcite , chang , qing and",
    "yang generalized the above result to locally conformally flat manifolds with certain curvature conditions and found conformal compactification of such manifold .    back to the case of surface , as is indicated by formula ( [ 1.2 ] ) , such manifold has isoperimetric inequality for very large euclidean balls .",
    "a natural question is whether it would have the same inequality for arbitrarily shaped domains , instead of only for very large euclidean balls .",
    "the answer to this question is affirmative by the work of li and tam in @xcite .",
    "they use the idea of comparing the domain s boundary length with the geodesic distance and analyze the asymptotic behavior of it .",
    "however on manifolds with higher dimensions , it seems almost impossible to apply the same technique . in this paper",
    ", we circumvent this difficulty by looking at the construction of quasiconformal map to prove the isoperimetric inequality for higher dimensions with totally finite @xmath0-curvature .",
    "the main result is the following :    [ c1.2 ] suppose @xmath40 is a noncompact complete riemannian manifold with normal metric and satisfies @xmath41 and @xmath42 then @xmath43 has isoperimetric inequality : @xmath44 . here",
    "the constant @xmath45 depends on @xmath28 .",
    "the more general sobolev inequality is also valid with @xmath46 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath50 , ( [ sob ] ) implies ( [ iso ] ) .    actually we have proved a stronger result .",
    "our theorem [ c1.2 ] is a direct consequence of the following :    [ main ] consider the manifold @xmath51 described in theorem [ c1.2 ] .",
    "suppose @xmath52 is the conformal factor taking the form of ( [ w ] ) then there is a @xmath53-quasiconformal map @xmath54 and constant @xmath55 such that @xmath56 here @xmath53 depends on @xmath57 and @xmath55 depends on the manifold @xmath28 .",
    "it is well known that if @xmath58 , there is counterexample .",
    "in fact , one can think of a manifold @xmath28 with only one end that looks like a cylinder , then it is not hard to see @xmath58 .",
    "such a manifold @xmath28 does nt have isoperimetric inequality , not to mention the q.c . map . with property ( [ q ] )",
    ", because the latter would imply the former .",
    "another thing is that even though the model case of the manifold described in theorem [ c1.2 ] is always the cone , and we will use it several times as our example .",
    "it should be clear that @xmath59 could be very close to the distribution : @xmath60 where @xmath61 means dirac distribution supported at point @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , we ca nt expect the manifold to be close to a cone outside a compact domain . nor can we control the ricci curvature from above and below in order to get isoperimetric inequality . finally it is reasonable that the constant @xmath55 in theorem [ main ] depends on the manifold .",
    "we will explain it in remark [ remark 3.1 ] .",
    "there are interesting results in the direction of finding quasiconformal map such that its jacobian is comparable to the volume form weight @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 for almost every @xmath65 . here  almost every \" is because quasiconformal map s jacobian may not be defined every where .",
    "a quite related problem is whether there exists a bi - lipschitz map between @xmath43=@xmath66 and the euclidean space @xmath67 , when assuming the total q - curvature is finite .",
    "it is equivalent to say whether there exists a homeomorphism @xmath68 , such that @xmath69 it turns out that a riemannian manifold is bi - lipschitz equivalent to euclidean space @xmath70 if and only if @xmath63 is comparable to the jacobian of some quasiconformal map .",
    "we now list some of the results about bi - lipschitz parametrization problem in the following : when @xmath71 fu @xcite proved that if gaussian curvature is totally finite and its absolute integral is very small , then there exists a bi - lipschitz map from @xmath28 to @xmath72 .",
    "later bonk and lang @xcite proved that if gaussian curvature is totally finite and @xmath73 , then there exists a bi - lipschitz map from @xmath28 to @xmath72 . for even dimensions @xmath74 ,",
    "the problem was solved for small total @xmath0-curvature by bonk , heinonen and saksman in @xcite .",
