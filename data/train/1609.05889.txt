    "the recent discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc established a research program that aims to explain the physics of fundamental interactions , like excitations manifested from fundamental fields , ending a program of tremendous experimental predictions - the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "this model has the merit of unifying the weak force and electromagnetism by the anderson - higgs mechanism .",
    "nevertheless , it is known that the description of the sm without neutrino mass is unsatisfactory .",
    "recent experiments indicate that the electrons have a bound for the electric dipole moment @xcite and the sm predicts that the electron is a punctual particle . by these experimental results",
    "we understand the necessity of investigating physics beyond the standard model .",
    "kostelecky and samuel @xcite showed that interactions in the context of the string field theory could lead to spontaneous breaking of the lorentz symmetry .",
    "such a scenario can not exist in the regime of sm , but can be the key for explaining regimes where quantum gravity and the early stages of the universe bring remanecent breaking effects in the limits of validity of sm . in these other regimes ,",
    "structure of spacetime and the corresponding particle physics are affected in their symmetries . a spontaneous breaking of lorentz symmetry",
    "can then be extented beyond the known scenarios of qed and qcd @xcite .",
    "lorentz violation theories are in the framework of standard model extension ( sme ) @xcite . from the sm perspective",
    ", lorentz symmetry breaking induces an assymmetry in the structure of spacetime , implying for instance that vacuum maxwell equations has to be changed by non - trivial contributions .",
    "one important feature of lvt in the domain of electrodynamics is the possibility of violating lorentz symmetry without breaking gauge symmetry .",
    "one of the first models in this sense was carried out by the carroll - field - jackiw model @xcite where breaking of the lorentz invariance is realized by the inclusion of an additional term in the maxwell lagrangian , while preserving the gauge symmetry .",
    "general case of @xmath1-electrodynamics was introduced in @xcite , determining the energy momentum tensor and basic properties of the plane wave solutions of @xmath1-electrodynamics .",
    "a more in - depth study of the model and its plane wave solutions was performed in @xcite , where equations of motion in maxwell form are derived .",
    "a special case of the @xmath1-parameter was discussed in @xcite that also constructs the plane - wave solutions including with polarization vectors .",
    "the idea that the special case of the @xmath1-parameter acts like an effective metric has been used widely in the literature @xcite .",

    "nowadays , studies in relativistic quantum effects @xcite that stem from a non minimal coupling with lorentz symmetry breaking @xcite has opened the possibility of investigating new implications in quantum mechanics that this violator background can promote .    in this work , we discuss free electromagnetic fields with a particular type of lorentz symmetry violation : the vacuum reduction of a @xmath0-type lorentz symmetry breaking theory @xcite in the absence of complex scalar field @xmath2 and @xmath3-parameter associated to a @xmath4 are zero",

    "we then consider a solution of maxwell equations derived in the cases of linear and elliptical polarization electromagnetic waves in the vacuum of cpt - even lorentz violation scenario and investigate the effect of the amplitude changing of the amplitudes electromagnetic wave fields and regimes of non - orthogonality of the electromagnetic wave fields and the eccentricity of the elliptical polarization with dependence on the @xmath1-term .",
