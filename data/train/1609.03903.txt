    "planets form from the reservoir of dust and gas residing in the circumstellar discs which surround young stars .",
    "the physical and chemical characteristics of this material influence the process of planet formation and are in turn influenced by the energetic radiation from the young stellar object .",
    "indeed , young stars are strong sources of x - ray radiation , with approximately one thousandth of their bolometric luminosity being emitted at energies higher than @xmath1 .",
    "x - rays play an important role in the disc evolution , by providing ionisation over a large range of columns ( e.g. igea & glassgold 1999 ; ercolano & glassgold 2013 ) , which is important for the chemical evolution of the material as well as for angular momentum transport mechanisms .",
    "in particular , ionisation of the disc atmosphere by the `` soft x - rays '' ( @xmath2 ) heats the gas and launches a thermal wind ( e.g. owen et al .",
    "2010 ) , which is able to disperse the disc , via ( a ) the formation of a gap , followed by ( b ) a hole which quickly grows in radius , with the outer disc being eroded from the inside - out .    the x - ray photoevaporation model ( ercolano et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ; owen et al . 2010 , 2011 , 2012 ) is successful in reproducing the observed two - timescale dispersal ( e.g. luhman et al .",
    "2010 ; koepferl et al .",
    "2013 ) , and it can reproduce the intensities and profiles of emission lines produced in the wind ( ercolano & owen , 2010 , 2016 ) . however , the direct observation of a disc undergoing gap formation via photoevaporation is still lacking . in this letter",
    "we propose that the gap at @xmath3 in the nearest protoplanetary disc , tw  hya , observed in the @xmath0 continuum by andrews et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , using the long - baseline atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , may indeed be the first directly imaged photoevaporative gap in a solar - type star to date .",
    "surprisingly , this possibility has not yet been properly explored in the recent literature .",
    "this letter is organised as follows : in section 2 we summarise the relevant characteristics and current evidence for photoevaporation in the tw  hya system . in section 3",
    "we explore the possible origin of the unresolved @xmath0 emission from the inner @xmath4 of the disc . in section 4",
    "we show dust and gas density distributions from a numerical model of a 1d viscously evolving disc , subject to x - ray photoevaporation .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in section 5 .",
    "tw  hya is considered a young solar analogue with a central stellar mass of approximately @xmath5 .",
    "being the closest gas - rich protoplanetary disc ( @xmath6 , van leeuwen 2007 ) , this object has been subject of a number of observational campaigns dating back from the early nineties ( e.g. blondel et al .",
    "its nearly pole - on inclination ( @xmath7 , qi et al .",
    "2004 ) further contributes to making tw  hya one of the reference objects for the study of protoplanetary discs .",
    "calvet et al . ( 2002 ) first reported evidence for a dust - depleted inner hole , which they placed at a radius of @xmath8 via detailed radiative transfer modelling of its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . on the basis of",
    "the @xmath9 silicon emission , calvet et al ( 2002 ) concluded that the inner region can not be completely devoid of dust , and they estimate that @xmath10 lunar mass of @xmath11 particles must be still present inside the cavity , and interpret this as evidence of a _ developing _ gap in the disc .",
    "the exact size of the gap of tw  hya has been an object of dispute in the literature .",
    "near - infrared ( eisner et al . 2006 ) and mm ( hughes et al . 2007 ) interferometry confirmed a size of @xmath8 for the central hole , while a gap radius of only @xmath12 was obtained by ratzka et al .",
    "( 2007 ) via mid - infrared intereferometric observations .",
    "the observations can however be reconciled if instead of an inner hole completely devoid of dust , an additional optically thick ring with a @xmath4 radius is considered ( e.g. akeson et al . 2011 ) .",
    "more recently menu et al ( 2014 ) presented a new model , which was able to fit all interferometric observations from near - infrared to wavelengths available at the time .",
    "this model required an inner cavity with radius @xmath13 with a maximum in the surface density occurring at @xmath14 .    while the presence of a gap or at least of a _ dust _ depleted region in the inner disc has been confirmed by all interferometric observations , the detection of a non - negligible accretion signature ( 4@xmath15 to @xmath16 , muzerolle et al .",
    ", 2000 ; eisner et al . 2010 ; manara et al . 2014 ) , implies that a significant amount of _ gas _ must still be present inside the dust cavity .",
    "andrews et al . ( 2016 ) presented long - baseline alma observations of the @xmath0 continuum from tw  hya , which are sensitive to millimeter - sized dust grains down to a spatial scale of @xmath3 .",
    "the data show a series of concentric dark and bright shallow ring - like structures in the outer disc , while the inner disk is dominated by a dark annulus centred at @xmath3 , separating a bright ring that peaks at @xmath17 and an unresolved continuum source less than @xmath4 in radius and emitting @xmath18 in flux .",
    "the modest brightness contrast of some of the concentric features at r @xmath19 may be associated with condensation fronts of abundant volatiles ( cuzzi & zahnle , 2004 ; okuzumi et al .",
    "2015 ) , or may be evidence of zonal flows ( johansen et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the dark annulus at @xmath20 must have , however , a different origin .",
    "the alma observations together with the dip in the sed at mid - infrared wavelengths ( calvet et al .",
    "2002 ) suggest that the gap must be depleted of grains from @xmath21 to @xmath22 size . on that basis ,",
    "andrews et al . ( 2016 ) argue against the dip being a consequence of changing solid properties at around the h@xmath23o snow - line . as an alternative",
    ", they suggest that a more detailed modeling of the alma data may show whether a young super - earth may be responsible for dynamically carving the observed gap ( e.g. , picogna & kley 2015 , rosotti et al .",
    "surprisingly , the photoevaporation scenario is not considered at all in that work .",
    "the tw  hya central object is known to emit substantial x - ray radiation , with a total x - ray flux ( @xmath24 ) of approximately @xmath25 , based on an extrapolation to lower and higher energies of the @xmath26 xmm - newton spectrum ( robrade & schmitt , 2006 ) . following equation 9 of owen , clarke & ercolano ( 2012 ) ,",
    "the corresponding mass loss rate due to x - ray photoevaporation is @xmath27 , which is roughly a factor of @xmath28 higher than the measured accretion rate for tw hya .",
    "owen et al ( 2010 ) predict that for a @xmath29 star and x - ray luminosity of @xmath30 x - ray photoevaporation will create a gap at @xmath20 , when the accretion rate falls to about a tenth of the wind rate .",
    "( e.g. see their figure 11 ) .",
    "hence , the dark annulus detected by andrews et al . ( 2016 ) may indeed be the first stage of the dispersal phase of the tw hya disc .",
    "direct evidence of currently ongoing photoevaporation is provided by the detection of a few @xmath31 blueshift in the profile of the [ neii ]  @xmath32 line ( herczeg et al .",
    "2007 ; pascucci & sterzik 2009 ) , which is well fit by both euv and x - ray photoevapoaration models ( alexander 2008 , ercolano & owen , 2010 ) .",
    "the [ oi]@xmath33 has also been shown to be produced in a slow - moving quasi - neutral x - ray photoevaporative wind ( ercolano & owen , 2016 ) , and is often observed to be blue - shifted with a low - velocity component of a few @xmath31 . in the case of tw  hya the [ oi]@xmath33 was found to be centred on the stello - centric velocity ( pascucci et al .",
    "this is not surprising given tw  hya near face - on inclination and the fact that the [ oi]@xmath33 line is emitted from the very inner regions of the disc wind ( ercolano & owen 2010 , 2016 ) , where the underlying disc is devoid of dust , allowing us to see the redshifted outflowing gas .",
    "the @xmath34 fwhm and @xmath35 line luminosity measured by pascucci et al . ( 2011 ) for [ oi]@xmath33 are also well reproduced by the x - ray photoevaporation models presented by ercolano & owen ( 2016 ) for accretion and x - ray luminosities and the inclination of tw  hya .",
    "andrews et al . ( 2016 ) report @xmath18 flux at @xmath0 as an unresolved continuum source from the inner @xmath36 of the tw  hya disc .",
    "this might look incompatible with a photo - evaporative origin for the gap .",
    "indeed , alexander & armitage ( 2007 ) found that large grains disappear quickly ( @xmath37 yr ) from the inner disc due to radial drift , suggesting that a gap would turn quickly into a hole , with no detectable central point source . in this section",
    "we show , however , how free - free gas emission or residual dust inside the gap can easily explain the observed flux , supporting the photo - evaporation hypothesis .",
    "pascucci et al .",
    "( 2012 ) analysed the long wavelength portion of the sed from tw  hya covering from @xmath0 out to 6  cm ( data from wilner et al .",
    "2005 and andrews et al .",
    "2012 ) and came to the conclusion that about half of the flux detected at 3.5 cm could not be accounted for by dust emission .",
    "they attributed the extra 140@xmath3840@xmath39jy at 3.5@xmath39 m to a photoevaporative disc wind .",
    "however , emission from a disc wind is expected to originate from a region far more extended than @xmath4 , and thus it can not explain the unresolved @xmath0 emission detected by andrews et al .",
    "dense ionised gas , however , exists also in the form of a stellar wind or an ionised bound inner disc atmosphere .",
    "one can obtain an upper limit to the contribution from gas free - free emission to the sub - mm flux by assuming a spherical optically thick wind . in this case the sed emission in the radio can be described by a power law with index 0.6 ( panagia & felli , 1975 ) . a 0.93mjy flux at @xmath0",
    "would then correspond to @xmath40 at @xmath41 , explaining thus most of the 140@xmath3840@xmath39jy excess flux at 3.5 cm reported by pascucci et al .",
    "this would lead to the conclusion that the compact , unresolved source in andrews et al .",
    "( 2016 ) can be caused by a stellar wind and there is no need to invoke the presence of dust in the inner disk .",
    "conversely , this is an upper limit to the emission of the wind at mm - wavelengths : if the wind is optically thin , the spectral index is also expected to be lower , meaning that its contribution in the ( sub-)mm will be lower .",
    "it is thus not excluded that a fraction of the compact unresolved emission at 870@xmath39 m may be caused by dust .",
    "we have calculated photoionisation models of the draining inner disc of tw hya with mocassin ( ercolano et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 , 2008b ) using the the inner @xmath4 of the gas and dust density distributions from ercolano & owen ( 2016 ) .",
    "this consists of a hydrodynamical wind solution for 0.7@xmath42 star and an x - ray luminosity of 2@xmath4310@xmath44 erg / sec , which is appropriate for tw hya ( e.g. cleeves et al .",
    "we refer to ercolano & owen ( 2010 , 2016 ) for specific details about the calculation methods . assuming an x - ray luminosity of 2.5@xmath4310@xmath44erg / sec we find a flux of @xmath45 at @xmath0 for a distance of @xmath6 , more than sufficient to explain the observed values .",
    "similar calculations , using a slightly different method and set - up , were performed by owen , scaife & ercolano ( 2013 ) , who found a flux of 100@xmath39jy at 150ghz for a distance of 140 pc , for an x - ray luminosity of 2.5@xmath4310@xmath44erg / sec . assuming the flux scales as @xmath46 , this corresponds to 1.15 mjy at a distance of 54pc , which is in agreement with our new estimates .",
    "our calculations thus demonstrate that free - free emission from gas , either in a wind or as a bound disk atmosphere can explain the 1mjy flux observed by andrews et al .",
    "( 2016 ) .",
    "if dust is responsible for all of the emission , then following equation 5 of andrews & williams ( 2005 ) for a factor five higher temperature , appropriate for the inner @xmath3 of the disc , we obtain that about @xmath47 lunar masses of mm - size grains must still be present in the inner disc .",
    "this is in contrast with the calculations of alexander & armitage ( 2007 ) , who find significant radial drift , with larger grains disappearing from the inner disc on timescales of @xmath37 yr .",
    "these estimates , however , are tailored to a significantly different disc and photoevaporation model . the mass accretion rate ( and thus surface density ) assumed in the alexander & armitage ( 2007 ) models",
    "are about an order of magnitude lower than tw  hya , and the @xmath48 viscosity parameter about a factor ten higher than what would be needed to explain the longevity and high mass of the tw  hya disc ( @xmath49 at @xmath50 bergin et al . , 2013 ;",
    "calvet et al .",
    "2002 suggest @xmath51 for a similar mass estimate of @xmath52 at @xmath50 ) .",
    "these two facts alone result in two orders of magnitude difference in the drift timescales , as will be shown below .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate for the disappearance of mm grains from the inner disc of tw  hya after the photoevaporative gap has opened at @xmath3 can be obtained as follows . ignoring factors of order unity and the contribution due to the gas velocity , for small stokes numbers ( @xmath53 )",
    ", the radial drift velocity can be expressed as ,    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the scale hight and @xmath56 is the keplerian velocity .",
    "the radial drift timescale is thus @xmath57    the stokes number of particles with size @xmath58 is : @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the surface density of the gas , and @xmath61 is the dust intrisic density .",
    "if the accretion rate is @xmath62 at the time of gap opening , then the surface density at @xmath3 can be obtained from the following , @xmath63 and therefore the drift timescale for the dust from @xmath3 onto the star , * with a typical @xmath64 * , is @xmath65 this values carries however significant uncertainties , mainly due to its strong dependence on the gas radial velocity , which we only roughly estimate from eq .  1",
    ", and our neglect of the changes in the draining inner disk surface density , which affects the stokes number . in brief , dust will remain longer in the inner disc if the viscosity is low  which is probably the case in the long - lived tw  hya disc  and/or if the accretion rate at the time of gap opening is high  again a probable scenario in tw  hya given the strong x - ray flux from the central object which results in high photoevaporation rates .",
    "this lends credence to the fact that we might indeed be able to observe the gap opening phase in the tw  hya disc .",
    "we have developed a simple 1d viscous evolution model which includes x - ray photoevaporation for a tw  hya - like system .",
    "our 1d gas surface density evolution code , spock , is described in detail in ercolano & rosotti ( 2015 ) . at @xmath66",
    "the disc has a mass of @xmath67 , a radius of @xmath68 and an accretion rate of @xmath69 .",
    "we solve the viscous evolution equation , taking into account the photo - evaporative mass - loss , on a grid of @xmath70 points uniformly spaced in @xmath71 extending from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .    in our model",
    "the gap opens between @xmath74 and @xmath75 at an age of @xmath76 . at this point",
    "the mass accretion rate onto the star is @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 years later ( @xmath79 of the global disc lifetime and @xmath80 of the transition phase lifetime ) the mass accretion rate has already dropped to @xmath81 and the gap outer radius is out to @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that one expects @xmath79 of the global protoplanetary disc population and @xmath80 of transition discs to be observed in this early clearing phase .",
    "these numbers show that a small , but not negligible fraction of young protoplanetary disks in nearby star forming regions should be in this evolutionary phase .",
    "size particles is shown at the time of gap opening.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    in order to verify the timescales for dispersal of dust particles of various sizes from the inner disc once the gap is opened , we have used the gas surface density distributions obtained with spock as an input to the fargo hydro code ( masset 2000 ) modified by picogna & kley ( 2015 ) .",
    "we model the dust as individual particles , sampling the evolution of a larger ensemble of single dust particles and their interaction with the surrounding environment .    in figure  1",
    "we show the drift timescales for particles of sizes between @xmath83 and @xmath84 just after the opening of the gap in the dust distribution ( as it is shown in the 2d dust distribution for @xmath0 size particles in figure  2 ) , when the gas mass accretion rates is @xmath85 . in the inner regions ( @xmath36 )",
    "particles of @xmath0 have a drift timescale of @xmath86 .",
    "the drift timescales have an abrupt change in their distribution inside @xmath87 because the strong gas radial velocity ( overplotted with a dashed line ) is directed outwards and drags with it the dust particles . inside @xmath3",
    "the gas radial velocity is not strong enough and the bigger dust particles ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) are able to migrate inwards but with a long drift time - scale .",
    "it is thus likely that some of the @xmath0 size particles still linger in the inner gas disk of tw hya and contribute to the emission of the unresolved @xmath90 flux detected by andrews et al .",
    "in this letter we presented argument in support of x - ray photoevaporation as the origin of the recently detected gap in the continuum emission of the tw hya disc . in this scenario ,",
    "tw hya is an object on the edge of dispersal , where the mass - loss - rate due to x - ray photoevaporation ( @xmath912@xmath4310@xmath92 , corresponding to the observed x - ray luminosity of tw hya ) is about ten times larger than the ( measured ) gas accretion rate , and hence in the process of opening a gap between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "it is not surprising to find an object in this phase , since current statistics show that one should expect of the order of 4 to 6 early phase clearing objects in each of the nearby star forming regions .",
    "we further show that the detection of @xmath911mjy continuum emission at 870@xmath39 m ( andrews et al . , 2016 ) is not in contrast with this scenario .",
    "we consider possible sources for the emission , finding that both free - free emission and dust continuum emission , or a combination of the two , are able to explain the observed flux level . our new photoionisation models , in agreement with previous estimates by pascucci et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and owen , scaife & ercolano ( 2013 ) indicate that free - free emission is produced in the ionised bound disc atmosphere in the draining inner ( @xmath93 ) disc .",
    "sub - mm size dust grains may also contribute to the emission , as they linger in the inner disc thanks to long stopping times in the disc of tw hya .",
    "indeed we calculate that the stopping time for @xmath0 grains is about @xmath94 at @xmath4 at the time of gap opening .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the x - ray photoevaporation model is consistent with a wide variety of observtional characteristics of the tw hya disk and , as such , it is the most likely explanation of the observed gap at @xmath3 , instead of the presence of a planet .",
    "our study thus suggests that our closest protoplanetary disc is an object caught at the start of the dispersal phase , making it the best suited natural laboratory to study this phenomenon .",
