    "discovery of superconductivity in copper oxides  @xcite and iron pnictides and chalcogenides  @xcite has generated interest in the coexistence and interplay of magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "@xcite the fe - based materials in particular show a close association of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism , with at least partial itinerant character and coupling of magnetism to electrons at the fermi surface .",
    "@xcite    superconductivity in these systems is believed to be unconventional , in that it is mediated by antiferromagnetic spin - fluctuations .  @xcite the large spin - fluctuations may arise as a consequence of nearness to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) , which can also lead to non - fermi liquid behavior , unusual transport and novel ground states .",
    "@xcite there is evidence for this both from comparison of standard density functional calculations with experiments and spectroscopic probes .",
    "@xcite    in any case , it is of interest to look for other materials that share similar characteristics . in this manuscript",
    "we present theoretical investigations of electronic and magnetic properties of cufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 , to serve as a precursor to future experimental studies .",
    "our study is motivated in part by recent experimental results for yfe@xmath0ge@xmath0 which indicate superconductivity along with highly enhanced fermi liquid properties and scalings characteristic of a material near a magnetic qcp .",
    "@xcite we identified cufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 as a compound with similar structural characteristics and , as discussed below , find many other similarities at the standard density functional level .",
    "cufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 is readily prepared by arc melting and crystallizes in orthorhombic structure with two formula units per cell .",
    "@xcite although it differs from the layered thcr@xmath0si@xmath0 structure of the fe - based superconductors with 122 stoichiometry , bond lengths and interactions exhibit several similarities .",
    "our calculated electronic band structure in the non - spin - polarized phase shows a large density of states at the fermi level , consistent with itinerant character .",
    "fermi surfaces in this system have a sheet like structure amenable to nesting and consequently to magnetic instabilities .",
    "calculation of different magnetic configurations reveal significant variations in energies and @xmath1 across them .",
    "the calculations reported in this manuscript are performed within density functional theory ( dft ) using plane wave basis set and pseudopotentials with the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package .",
    "@xcite we use generalized gradient approximation ( pbe - gga ) for exchange correlation .",
    "@xcite the calculations are carried out with the energy cutoff of 400 ev and * k*-mesh of @xmath3 after carefully checking for convergence .",
    "we also verified some of our calculations with the all electron code wien2k ,  @xcite to confirm that there are no artifacts of pseudopotential method .",
    "ge@xmath0*. it shows the orthorhombic unitcell containing two formula units.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the structure of cufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 was determined by zavalii _",
    "et al _ by x - ray powder diffraction on samples prepared through arc melting .",
    "@xcite they found the material to crystallize in the orthorhombic structure , with space group @xmath4 and lattice constants ( in   ) @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ figstr ] , the unitcell contains two formula units with cu occupying the @xmath7 sites .",
    "fe occupies two inequivalent positions with the @xmath8 ions ( fe@xmath9 ) bonded octahedrally to surrounding ge , while fe at @xmath10 sites ( fe@xmath0 ) are bonded with four cu ions on the @xmath11 plane and two ge on the @xmath12 plane .",
    "optimization of the experimental structure in the ferromagnetic phase yielded volume within 1% and atomic coordinates within 0.1   , which suggest that the theoretical equilibrium structure is very close to the experimental one .",
    "note that nearest neighbor fe - fe distances are around 2.5    ( fig .  [ figbond ] ) , which is shorter than the 2.8    in yfe@xmath0ge@xmath0 , and suggests that direct fe - fe interactions will be important in this system as well .",
    "ge@xmath0 unitcell on to @xmath13 plane .",
    "* fe@xmath9 ( middle layer ) are octahedrally coordinated .",
    "the atomic distances are marked in angstrom.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "as can be seen from the non - spin - polarized gga bandstructure in fig .",
    "[ figbs ] , the states close to fermi level are dominated by fe-@xmath14 levels .",
    "absence of strong crystal field splitting in the fe-@xmath15 states point to the fact that the direct fe - fe interactions dominate , a character common to other iron - based superconductors .",
    "@xcite from the band character plot we can see that fe@xmath9 and fe@xmath0 exhibit different dispersions close to fermi level . for the directions",
    "plotted , the fe@xmath9 bands remain relatively flat and this leads to a higher density of octahedral fe@xmath9-@xmath14 levels near fermi energy as can be seen from the partial density of states plotted in fig .",
    "[ figdos ] .",
    "the fe@xmath0 bands show relative large dispersions along @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions , suggesting a three dimensional nature of the band structure .",
    "the cu-@xmath14 levels lie between -5 and -2 ev relative to fermi level and thus are fully occupied , which can also be seen from fig .",
    "[ figdos ] .",
    "nearly all fe and cu @xmath18 characters lie above the fermi level . counting the occupied states with different characters",
    "suggests nominal occupations of cu @xmath19 , fe @xmath20 and ge @xmath21 .",
    "the densities of states ( fig .",
    "[ figdos ] ) also show features similar to yfe@xmath0ge@xmath0 and the fe - based superconductors  @xcite such as the dip in the dos just above @xmath22 .",
    "the calculated electronic dos at the fermi level , @xmath1 , is also high at @xmath23 ev@xmath24 per formula unit .",
    "this corresponds to a bare sommerfeld specific heat coefficient @xmath25 mj/(mol k@xmath26 ) , which is in fact higher than the calculated value for yfe@xmath0ge@xmath0 .",
    "the contribution from different fe sites to @xmath1 are found to be significantly different ; we get 5.2 ev@xmath24 and 1.6 ev@xmath24 respectively for fe@xmath9 and fe@xmath0 .",
    "this suggest that the octahedrally coordinated fe@xmath9 has a higher tendency for itinerant magnetism in this material .",
    "the contributions from different @xmath15 orbitals of fe ions are shown in fig .",
    "[ figfedos ] .",
    "as we can see , various states contribute towards density near the fermi level similar to fe pnictides .",
    "the calculated fermi surfaces in the paramagnetic phase is shown in fig .",
    "[ figfs ] .",
    "there are seven bands that cross fermi level and all of them have strong fe-@xmath15 character as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figbs ] .",
    "the fermi surfaces are dominated by four mostly flat sheets in the @xmath27 plane of the reciprocal space . out of these",
    "the first three ( 3,4,5 ) have strong fe@xmath9 character .",
    "the closest of these , the pair marked by `` 3 '' in fig .",
    "[ figfs ] are separated by half the reciprocal space distance @xmath28 .",
    "we can expect strong nesting between these bands which may lead to antiferromagnetic coupling between fe moments along the @xmath29 axis .",
    "in addition to the sheets perpendicular to the @xmath28 axis , there are also a hole pocket ( 1 ) at the @xmath30 point and an elongated disk shaped electron pocket ( 7 ) around @xmath31 and a dumbbell shaped structure ( 2 ) along @xmath32 .",
    "the large density of states at the fermi level @xmath1 , discussed earlier , implies that this system has magnetic instabilities as per the stoner criterion .",
    "certain itinerant systems , such as yfe@xmath0ge@xmath0 , do not order magnetically even though dft calculations predict magnetic ground state .",
    "@xcite large spin - fluctuations are believed to be responsible for this effect , which happens in systems close to a qcp , and this leads to interesting new physics in these systems .",
    "@xcite dft is known to overestimate magnetic tendencies in itinerant systems close to qcps because the exchange - correlation functionals commonly employed are based on the properties of the uniform electron gas which neglects the spin fluctuations associated with the qcp .",
    "@xcite however , we are not aware of any magnetic measurements of cufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 .    thus , we carried out spin polarized calculations in several magnetic configurations and find that a ferromagnetic state is lower in energy by 102 mev / f.u .",
    "compared to non - spin - polarized state .",
    "a magnetic moment of about 1.4 @xmath33 develops on the fe atoms and the @xmath1 drops to about 4.1 ev@xmath24 . for comparison",
    ", we also calculated other magnetic structures and the results are listed in table .",
    "[ taben ] , and explained as follows . in the af-@xmath34 ,",
    "the fe planes are arranged antiferromagnetically along the @xmath35 direction and ferromagnetic in other directions . in af-@xmath36 the fe@xmath9-fe@xmath0 coupling is afm along @xmath35 , but fe@xmath9-fe@xmath9",
    "the af-@xmath29 is afm along the @xmath29 direction and we find that a similar af-@xmath2 could not be stabilized .",
    "the af-@xmath37 corresponds to checkerboard arrangement of moments in the @xmath11 plane .",
    "finally , af-@xmath38 is obtained by starting from a different configuration and turns out to have the lowest energy .",
    "it is similar to af-@xmath36 , except that it is also afm along the @xmath29 direction .",
    ".*magnetic properties from gga .",
    "* [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for different magnetic ordering patterns studied ( see text ) , the resulting magnetic moments @xmath39 , energies and density at the fermi surface @xmath1 in units of ev@xmath24 per formula unit .",
    "the energy of paramagnetic case ( nsp ) is taken to be zero .",
    "[ taben ]    the large variations in energies and @xmath1 across the ordered magnetic configurations suggest itinerant character of fe moments . note in particular that the difference in energy between different magnetic orders is as much as 0.11 ev / f.u . , which is more than half the as much energy difference between a non - spin - polarized calculation and the lowest energy state and that the values of @xmath1 also vary over a large range depending on the particular order .",
    "moreover , the lowest energy configuration af-@xmath38 is only 18 mev lower than the next lowest configuration . in our calculations ,",
    "fm and af-@xmath29 structures have similar energies , which suggest that magnetic exchange along @xmath29 direction is small .",
    "however , af-@xmath38 is lower than af-@xmath36 by about 50 mev / f.u . , while the difference between the two cases is afm along @xmath29 .",
    "this also suggests that a heisenberg type model with nearest neighbor interactions will not fit this system .    finally , we also calculated magnetic phases with local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "it has been found that for itinerant systems near qcp , calculations with lda predict much weaker magnetic tendencies .",
    "@xcite this corresponds to a relative weakness of the momentum formation .",
    "indeed , we find that the fe moments in the fm configuration are 0.98 and 0.48 @xmath33 within lda which are much smaller than the gga moments of 1.44 and 1.40 @xmath33 respectively , as given in table  [ taben ] .",
    "our theoretical calculations on cufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 suggest that this material is an interesting itinerant magnetic system .",
    "the electronic structure shows similarities with those of the fe - based superconductors .",
    "the fermi surfaces show parallel sheet - like structures with potential nesting induced instabilities .",
    "several magnetic configurations are stable , but the lowest energy is reached when fe moments are ferromagnetic along @xmath2 and antiferromagnetic along @xmath29 and @xmath35 directions . on the scale of moment formation energy , there are significant variations in energies and densities of states at the fermi level between different magnetic configurations , which also points to itinerant character in this system .",
