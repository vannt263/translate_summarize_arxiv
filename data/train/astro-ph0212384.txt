    "galactic black hole candidates show variety of spectra at x - ray and @xmath0-ray energies . these can be roughly described in terms of a soft , quasi - thermal component from the accretion disc together with a power - law - like tail extending to much higher energies .",
    "five ` canonical ' spectral states have been identified historically , based on the luminosity and spectral shape ( see e.g.  esin , mcclintock & narayan 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the _ very high state _ is generally seen at the highest luminosities , where the soft thermal component ( with temperature of 0.51 kev ) and power - law tail ( photon spectral index @xmath1 = 23 ) have comparable power . in the _ high state _ the hard tail is much weaker or sometimes even not present .",
    "the _ intermediate state _ is rather like the very high state , but at lower disc temperature and luminosity ( belloni et al .",
    "1996 ; mndez & van der klis 1997 ) , while the _ low state _ is somewhat different , being characterised by a hard ( @xmath2 ) power - law - like spectrum with a very weak , low temperature disc component ( bauciska - church et al .  1995 ; di salvo et al .",
    "2001 ) . at very low luminosities ,",
    "transient sources go into the _ quiescent state _ , which is a very low luminosity version of the _ low state _",
    "( kong et al .  2000 ; sutaria et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the high and very high states are often described as soft states , while the low state is commonly referred to as a hard state .",
    "persistent sources like cyg x-1 and lmc x-1 spend most of their time in one state , however transients like nova muscae can progress through a sequence of all five states during an outburst ( ebisawa et al .",
    "see done & gierliski ( 2003 ) for an overview of these spectral states .",
    "the power - law - like tails extending to x/@xmath0-ray energies are commonly explained by compton up - scattering of the soft seed photons from the accretion disc by a population of high - energy electrons . in the low / hard state",
    "the observed hard spectra roll over at 100200 kev , indicating that the electrons are mostly thermal ( with typical temperatures of @xmath3 100 kev ) and have optical depth of order unity ( e.g.  gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ; zdziarski et al .  1998 ;",
    "frontera et al .",
    "by contrast , in the soft states the steeper tail extends unbroken to mev energies ( grove et al .",
    "1998 ) , indicating that the electron energy distribution is predominantly non - thermal .",
    "more detailed spectral studies of the very high- and high - state spectra show that the tail is best described by comptonization from a complex electron distribution , where there is both a low temperature ( @xmath4 kev ) thermal electron distribution ( ycki , done & smith 2001 ; kubota , makishima & ebisawa 2001 ) together with non - thermal power - law electrons ( gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ; zdziarski et al .",
    "a two - component electron distribution could arise fairly naturally from non - thermal electron acceleration regions powered by magnetic reconnections above a disc .",
    "low - energy electrons cool preferentially by coulomb collisions leading to a thermal distribution while the high - energy electrons cool by compton scattering , preserving a non - thermal distribution ( coppi 1999 ) .",
    "alternatively , the thermal and non - thermal electrons could be spatially distinct , e.g.  magnetic reconnection above the disc can produce a non - thermal electron distribution , while overheating of the inner disc produces the thermal comptonization ( kubota et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the soft and hard states are clearly distinct in their spectral properties ( e.g. zdziarski et al .  2002 ) .",
    "transition between the states is compatible with being driven by a changing accretion geometry , where the low state has an accretion disc only at large radii , with the inner disc being replaced by a hot , optically thin , geometrically thick flow ( e.g.  poutanen , krolik & ryde 1997 ) . with increasing accretion rate the disc moves inwards increasing its temperature and the number of seed photons cooling the inner flow so the comptonized spectrum becomes softer .",
    "eventually , when the inner flow becomes optically thick it collapses , the inner disc replaces the hot flow and the source reaches one of the soft states ( see e.g.   esin et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "this review of spectral properties draws heavily from the very few broad bandpass x/@xmath0-ray observations of black holes . to constrain both",
    "the disc and hard component requires simultaneous data over a broad energy range , ideally @xmath3 0.11000 kev . while both the phoswich detector system on board _ bepposax _ and high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) on board _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) can give data out to @xmath3 100200 kev , the oriented scintillation spectrometer experiment ( osse ) on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _",
    "( _ cgro _ ) is unique in being able to extend the bandpass to higher energies .",
    "this is especially important in soft states , as there the hard component is known to extend to the highest energies .",
    "however , there are only very few broad - band observations of black hole candidates in these spectral states : grs  1915 + 105 ( zdziarski et al .  2001 ;",
    "ueda et al .  2002 ) , gro  j165540 ( tomsick et al .  1999 ) , cyg x-1 ( gierliski et al .  1999 ; mcconnell et al .  2002 )",
    ". however , both gro  j165540 and grs  1915 + 105 are thought to be extreme kerr black holes due to their high accretion disc temperatures ( e.g.  zhang , cui & chen 1997 ) , so there are _ no _ very high state broad - band spectra of ` normal ' black holes .",
    "in this paper we remedy the situation by analysing the broad - band simultaneous _",
    "rxte_/osse data of the x - ray black hole transient xte j1550564 , and derive constraints on the electron distribution and accretion flow geometry .",
    "we show that the hard tail is remarkably similar to that seen in the extreme kerr , microquasar black holes , so it is most probably a generic feature of high mass accretion rate flow onto a black hole rather than being associated with spin or radio jets .",
    "the x - ray nova xte j1550564 was discovered during its spectacular outburst in 1998 ( smith et al .",
    "two weeks into the outburst it reached a peak flux of 6.8 crab ( @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 @xmath7 ) in 210 kev energy range , making it the brightest x - ray transient observed so far by _",
    "rxte_. the x - ray ( 210 kev ) lightcurve from all - sky monitor ( asm ) , is more complex than a fast rise , exponential decay , having a bright flare followed by two plateaus separated by a weak minimum .",
    "such lightcurves are not uncommon ( see e.g.  chen , shrader & livio 1997 ) , and are probably connected to enhanced mass transfer from the irradiated companion star ( esin , lasota & hynes 2000 ) . the complex x - ray spectral evolution during the outburst is shown in fig .  [ fig : lightcurves ] by comparing the 210 kev lightcurve from asm to the harder x - ray ( 20100 kev ) lightcurve from _ cgro _ burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) .",
    "more details of this spectral evolution are given in sobczak et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , homan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , wilson & done ( 2001 ) and kubota et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "observations of the optical companion ( orosz et al .",
    "2002 ) led to an estimate of the compact object mass , 8.410.8 m@xmath8 , confirming its black hole nature .",
    "the inclination angle of the binary is quite high , @xmath9@xmath10 ( both estimates are given with @xmath11 errors , the @xmath12 ranges are 6.815.6 m@xmath8 and @xmath13@xmath14 , respectively ) .",
    "the distance is less well constrained by their data on the optical companion , with @xmath15 = 3.07.6 kpc ( best fit value of 5.3  kpc ) . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath16 = 10m@xmath8 , @xmath17 and @xmath15 = 5.3 kpc .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the compton reflection requires a substantial amount of relativistic smearing .",
    "we fix the inner disc radius at @xmath18 during the fit , but values higher that @xmath3 15@xmath19 are ruled - out",
    ". the best - fitting model give unphysical rest - frame iron line energy of 5.6 kev .",
    "this probably indicates that the compton reflection model we use here is inadequate , as already inferred from the _ asca _ fits ( section [ sec : asca ] ) .",
    "these fits can be dramatically improved ( @xmath20 , model hybth ) by including an additional , optically thick , thermal comptonization component ( for which we use thcomp code ) .",
    "the residuals in figs .",
    "[ fig : spec3]@xmath21 and [ fig : spec3]@xmath22 show that the improvement affects the whole spectral range , though in particular the features below @xmath3 10 kev are substantially smoothed .",
    "the model is detailed in table [ tab : eqpair ] , but again the complex correlations between parameters mean that again the errors are only representative as we fixed = 0.59 ( from model hyb ) and @xmath23 .",
    "the hot plasma properties are insensitive to the presence of the additional thermal compton component .",
    "both hyb and hybth models predict @xmath24 1 and a significant fraction of the hard power from non - thermal electrons ( @xmath25 0.5 ) .",
    "they both rule out pair - dominated plasma .",
    "the main difference is in the optical depth of the comptonizing medium , which decreased from @xmath32.8 to @xmath31.8 when thcomp was added .",
    "the extrapolated unabsorbed bolometric flux of xte  j1550564 from both models is @xmath26 erg @xmath7 s@xmath6 . at a distance of 5.3 kpc , for a 10m@xmath8 black hole",
    ", this corresponds to about @xmath27 .",
    "as we have outlined in the introduction , there are at least two distinct soft spectral states of black hole binaries : high and very high .",
    "we attribute our observation of xte j1550564 to the very high state .",
    "how does it compare with other sources , in both soft states ?",
    "[ fig : hs_vhs ] shows a comparison of the high- and very high - state model spectra .",
    "the high - state spectrum is from cyg x-1 ( gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ) while the very high - state one is from xte j1550564 ( this paper ) .",
    "the same model is used for both , with a hybrid electron distribution calculated using the eqpair code ( coppi 1999 ) .",
    "the main difference between the high and very high states seems to be the amount of comptonization of the disc spectrum . in the high state",
    "many of the disc photons escape without being strongly comptonized , therefore the comptonizing plasma either covers only a small fraction of the disc and/or has low optical depth . in the very high state",
    "most of the disc emission is scattered to substantially higher energies , so the comptonizing medium must have a substantial optical depth and cover most of the disc .    however , we caution that the amount of comptonization is not always straightforward to derive from the spectra . for example , zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2001 ) fit two soft state _",
    "rxte_/osse spectra from grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "the ` ultrasoft ' high - state spectrum ( vp 813 ) has a strong , dominating soft component and a weak high - energy tail .",
    "it is similar to the cyg x-1 spectrum from fig .",
    "[ fig : hs_vhs ] , but the temperature of the soft component and its ratio of power to the hard tail is larger . the second observation analyzed by zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is a typical very high - state spectrum ( vp 619 ) , with comparable distribution of power between the disc and the tail , similar to the xte j1550564 spectrum analysed here ( see fig .  2 in zdziarski et al .",
    "however , the detailed spectral modelling with eqpair suggests a rather different interpretation of this high state to that outlined above .",
    "what looks like a disc in the high - state spectrum of grs 1915 + 105 is fit by comptonization of the disc in optically thick , low - temperature plasma , very different to the high state of cyg x-1 .",
    "however , it seems more likely that this simply reflects the fact that the disc spectral models do not adequately describe the observed disc emission .",
    "the dominating soft component in grs 1915 + 105 probably comes from the disc itself , while an optically thin , hot plasma is responsible for the weak hard tail .",
    "thus we conclude that there is probably an increase in the covering fraction and/or optical depth of the comptonizing plasma which drives the source evolution from the high to very high states .",
    "another difference between the high and very high states is a change in shape of the non - thermal tail .",
    "the power - law index of the injected electron distribution is steeper in the very high state than in the high state , as is also seen in grs 1915 + 105 ( zdziarski et al .",
    "thus it seems that there are also changes in the non - thermal electron acceleration associated with the source moving from high to very high state .",
    "during its 1998/1999 outburst the black hole candidate xte j1550564 showed a variety of x/@xmath0-ray spectral states . in this paper",
    "we have analyzed its broadband spectrum during the very high state .",
    "this spectral state is characterised by the presence of the soft , high - energy tail extending without any apparent break above @xmath3 300 kev .",
    "such a tail differs from the low / hard state tail both in having a significantly softer spectral index and in the lack of high - energy cutoff ( grove et al .",
    "phenomenologically , the osse spectra of these tails can be described as a power law with spectral index @xmath28 2.43.1 ( grove et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this observation @xmath29 .",
    "we have shown that the broadband x/@xmath0-ray spectrum of xte j1550564 can be well fit by a model in which seed photons from the disc are compton up - scattered by both thermal and non - thermal electrons .",
    "comptonization on purely thermal or purely power - law electrons can be ruled out .",
    "the thermal and non - thermal electron distributions may be distinct , or they may instead form a single hybrid thermal / non - thermal distribution .",
    "this is reflected in the modelling of the xte j1550564 spectrum , which we have fitted by separate thermal plus non - thermal ( model plth ) and hybrid ( model hyb ) comptonizations .",
    "however , even if there is a spatially separate non - thermal electron population , these electrons will interact via coulomb collisions , creating a thermal low - energy extension to the power - law distribution .",
    "thus , we expect a hybrid distribution of comptonizing electrons even from a completely non - thermal electron acceleration mechanism .",
    "therefore , the plth model seems to be less physically motivated , and a single hybrid plasma ( hyb ) would be our model of choice as the simplest , physical description of the data .",
    "however , spectral fitting gives the opposite result , with the less physical model ( plth ) being strongly statistically preferred .",
    "since we expect that the non - thermal electrons form a hybrid plasma , the next step in complexity would be two separate electron distributions , with one thermal and one hybrid ( rather than one thermal and one power law ) .",
    "this model ( hybth ) provides an excellent fit to the data , statistically similar to plth but without using an unphysical power law electron distribution .",
    "however , closer examination of the maxwellian component in hybth ( component denoted as th in fig .  [ fig : spec3]@xmath22 ) reveals its suspicious similarity in spectral shape to the compton reflected continuum .",
    "perhaps it is not due to emission from some thermal , optically thick plasma at all .",
    "perhaps it simply accounts for inaccuracies of the reflection model .",
    "in particular , the reflection model used here overestimates the depth of the iron edge for ionized material as it does not include compton upscattering ( ross , fabian & young 1999 ) .",
    "while the single hybrid plasma ( hyb ) is _ statistically _ ruled out when compared to the two - component solution ( hybth ) , better reflection models are required before this can be a robust conclusion .    whatever is the physical reality behind this additional thermal compton component , the properties of the hybrid plasma are established quite robustly and do not change much between hyb and hybth .",
    "the ratio of soft to hard compactness is very well defined by the shape of the spectrum ( @xmath24 1 ) , while the fraction of the power in non - thermal electrons is @xmath25 0.5 .",
    "once again , the presence of non - thermal electrons is required to form the high energy tail observed beyond 300  kev .",
    "but where do they come from ?",
    "one obvious mechanism for such high - energy emission is from a jet , as in the blazars and radio - loud quasars ( see e.g. ghisellini et al .  1998 ) .",
    "a jet is present in xte j1550564 indeed at this time , although its radio emission is declining rapidly throughout the osse observation ( wu et al .",
    "2002 ) , so its link with the x/@xmath0-ray emission is doubtful .",
    "moreover , the fact that a similar high - energy tail is seen in the high state as well as in the very high state immediately rules out a direct association with the jet as the radio emission is strongly quenched in the high state ( corbel et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "an alternative mechanism of bulk motion of in - falling material near the black hole horizon was proposed by chakrabarty & titarchuk ( 1995 ) , but the free fall results in fairly low electron energies , with lorentz factors @xmath30 .",
    "these electrons are unable to up - scatter photons past @xmath3 100300 kev , resulting in a cutoff in the power - law spectrum ( laurent & titarchuk 1999 ; zdziarski et al .",
    "since such a cutoff is not seen in the xte j1550564 data , we find the bulk motion comptonization to be an unlikely explanation of the observed emission .",
    "this leaves magnetic reconnection above the disc as the only known possible source of hard x - ray dissipation at high mass accretion rates . the accretion disc viscosity is now known to be linked to a magnetic dynamo , so magnetic buoyancy can lead to some fraction of the reconnection events occurring in a corona rather than deep inside the disc ( see e.g.  hawley & balbus 2002 ) , accelerating electrons to high energies ( di matteo 1998 ) .",
    "we speculate that the high and very high state spectra are continuous rather than two separate spectral states , linked by an increase in the covering fraction of this magnetic corona over the disc .    concluding our paper we summarise our main results :    * the broad - band x/@xmath0-ray spectrum of xte j1550564 in the very high state can be well described by inverse compton emission from hybrid , thermal / non - thermal plasma .",
    "* comptonization on purely thermal or purely power - law electrons can not explain the observed spectrum .",
    "* the high - energy power - law tail observed here is similar in other black hole binaries in the high and very high states , showing that it is a generic property of high mass accretion rate black holes .",
    "this research has been supported in part by the polish kbn grant 2p03d00514 . we thank john tomsick for providing the computer code for the pca pile - up correction and aya kubota for useful discussions ."
