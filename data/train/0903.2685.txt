    "in recent years considerable research attention has been paid to electron transport through double quantum dot(dqd)systems@xcite , which are an artificial small quantum systems can be readily controlled by external gate voltage and also exhibit a variety of interesting strongly correlated electron behaviors .",
    "basically , there are two different experimental realizations of dqd system : dqds connected in serial@xcite or in parallel configurations@xcite . electron transport through both configurations have been studied in experiments , the molecular states of the double dots and also the competition between kondo effect and the rkky interaction have been observed@xcite .    the theoretical studies on electron transport through dqds are largely devoted to the system in the kondo regime . for dqds connected in serial , the antiferromagnetic correlations between two single - level coupled qds is in competition with kondo correlations between the qds and the electrons in the leads , therefore it gives rise to rich ground state physical properties at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "for dqds with large capacitive coupling , the simultaneous appearance of the kondo effect in the spin and charge sectors results in an su(4 ) fermi liquid ground state@xcite . by increasing interdot capacitive coupling",
    ", a quantum phase transition of kosterlitz - thouless type to a non - fermi - liquid state with anomalous transport properties is predicted@xcite .",
    "martins et al argued that ferromagnetic state can not be realized in two single - level qds connected in serial , but they predicts that fm state can be developed in two double - level qds@xcite . for the dqd system in parallel configuration , the physical properties can be quite different , since the interference effect will play an important role in its transport properties . the fano effect for electron transport through bonding and antibonding channels in dqds system has been studied@xcite .    due to the strong correlation of electrons in the qds",
    ", it is a non - trivial problem to treat those systems theoretically .",
    "it is well known that wilson s numerical renormalization group@xcite method is a nonperturbative approach to quantum impurity problem , which can take into account the on - site coulomb repulsion and the spin exchange interaction between the electrons in dqds exactly , in contrast to the slave boson mean field theory or the equation of motion method within hartree - fock approximation .",
    "the nrg method have already been applied to investigate a lot of problems in the electron transport through qd systems .",
    "for instance , dqds connected in serial@xcite , the quantum phase transition in multilevel qd@xcite , kondo effect in coupled dqds with rkky interaction in external magnetic field@xcite , the side coupled dqd system@xcite and quantum phase transitions in parallel quantum qds @xcite etc .",
    "however , in our opinion the consequences of the interplay of fano resonance and the kondo effect on electron conductance through dqds in parallel still havent been well elucidated . in this paper",
    "we will investigate the electron transport properties for the dqds in parallel configuration by using the nrg method .",
    "we will show that for dqds without interdot tunneling , the underscreen kondo effect plays an essential role in the conductance .",
    "the linear conductance , spin correlation , and local density of state in this system are obtained .",
    "electron transport through parallel - coupled dqds with interdot tunneling , on - site coulomb interaction and capacitive interdot coupling can be described by the following anderson impurity model : @xmath2 where @xmath3 denote annihilation(creation ) operators for electrons in the leads(@xmath4 ) , and @xmath5 those of the single level state in the i - th dot ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the electron number operator with spin index @xmath8 in the i - th dot , and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the intra - dot coulomb interaction between electrons , @xmath11 is the interdot capacitive coupling .",
    "@xmath12 is the interdot tunnel coupling , and @xmath13 is the tunnel matrix element between lead @xmath14 and dot @xmath15 .",
    "it should be noted that an interdot magnetic exchange term @xmath16 is not explicitly included in this hamiltonian since it is not an independent parameter but a function of the interdot tunneling(@xmath17 ) .",
    "we consider the symmetric coupling case with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the hybridization strength between the @xmath15-th dot and the lead @xmath14 .    in order to access the low - energy physics of this dqd system ,",
    "we adopt the wilson s nrg approach . by symmetric combination of the lead orbitals , the hamiltonian in eq.(1 )",
    "can be mapped to single - channel two - impurity anderson model .",
    "because the anti - symmetric combination of lead orbitals are totally decoupled with the qds , they can be neglected in the hamiltonian .",
    "following the standard nrg method , one defines a series of rescaled hamiltonian @xmath20 as following @xmath21\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the discretization parameter @xmath22 , and @xmath23@xcite .",

    "the above one dimensional lattice model is iteratively diagonalized by using the recursion relation @xmath30 the basis set in each iteration step is truncated by retaining only those states with low - lying energies . in our numerical calculation , we keep totally @xmath31 low - lying energy states in each step without counting the @xmath32 degeneracy .",
    "the current formula through the dqds is given by the generalized landauer formula@xcite @xmath33t(\\omega)\\;,\\\\\\ ] ] where the transmission probability @xmath34 $ ] , with @xmath35 .",
    "the retarded / advanced green s functions(gf ) @xmath36 have @xmath37 matrix structures , which account for the double dot structure of the system .",
    "the matrix elements of the retarded gf are defined in time space as @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the transmission probability @xmath39 can be obtained by calculating the imaginary parts of the gf of dqds or the spectral density @xmath40 .",
    "then , the linear conductance at the absolute zero temperature can be given by taking the zero frequency limit of the transmission probability @xmath41 .",
    "one advantage of the nrg is accurate determination of the low - energy spectral density of the quantum impurity models . by a standard procedure in nrg @xcite",
    ", the spectral density at zero temperature can be calculated according to the following formula @xmath42 where the matrix element @xmath43 , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 being the ground state and exited eigenstate of the impurity model hamiltonian , respectively .     in each quantum dot as a function of the gate voltage @xmath46 .",

    "one can define the averaged energy level of qds as @xmath58 , and the energy level difference @xmath59 .",
    "both of them can be tuned experimentally by external gate voltages .    at first",
    ", we consider dqds without interdot tunneling ( @xmath50 ) . in fig.1(a )",
    "the occupation number of electrons @xmath60 in each qd is plotted as a function of the average energy level @xmath46 .",
    "the electron occupation number increases consecutively by tuning the qd level below the fermi energy . for this dqds with interdot capacitive interaction",
    ", one can easily discern the different regions of occupation states : from empty occupation to the state with total four electrons in dqds . in the case of two identical qds ( @xmath61 ) ,",
    "abrupt jumps of the occupation number are observed at some particular gate voltage .",
    "one can see that the position of jumps can be identified as the region where the dqds have odd number of electrons .",
    "for dqds with different energy levels(@xmath62 ) , the qd with low energy level is occupied first , and because of interdot capacitive interaction , it will greatly suppress the occupation of electron in another qd as compared with the two identical qds case .",
    "the interdot spin - correlation @xmath63 as a function of energy level @xmath46 is shown in fig.1(b ) , where the spin operators in the i - th qd are defined by @xmath64 .",
    "it shows that the interdot spin correlation is antiferromagnetic in the mixed valence regime , and is ferromagnetic in the doubly occupied regime , where each qd is occupied by one electron .",
    "for dqds with energy level difference , the spin correlation in mixed valence regime is greatly suppressed , but there are still large ferromagnetic spin correlation in the doubly occupied regime . in the identical qds(@xmath61 )",
    "case , the abrupt jumps in occupancy and the spin correlation turn from fm to afm have also been found in ref.@xcite for @xmath65-qd system(@xmath66 ) without interdot capacitive coupling , and this phenomenon is interpreted as a kind of quantum phase transitions .",
    "however , one can see from the dashed line in fig.1 that the abrupt jumps both in occupancy and spin correlation disappear when @xmath67 , hence this kind of phase transition is unstable with respect to the perturbation by gate voltage difference in qds .",
    "we attribute this kind of abrupt jump as a result of fano resonance and the crossing of the antibonding state energy level with the fermi energy .     as a function of the dot level at zero temperature .",

    "the linear conductance @xmath71 at zero temperature vs. the average qd energy level @xmath46 is depicted .",
    "as shown in fig.2(a ) , the kondo effects are manifested by peaks in the curve of the linear conductance , where the conductances approach the unitary limit ( @xmath72 ) . in the regime of odd electron occupation , the dqds act as a localized spin ( s=1/2 ) , and the kondo effect is arose from the spin exchange interaction between the localized electron spin and that of the electrons in the leads . whereas , in the doubly occupied regime",
    ", the unitary conductance is due to the underscreened spin 1 kondo effect , it will be shown in the following that in this regime the two electrons confined in the dqds form a spin triplet state in the ground state . in the presence of sufficient interdot tunneling @xmath12 , the kondo effect in the singly occupied regime and spin 1 kondo effect is strongly suppressed , but some asymmetrical peaks of conductance appears in the mixed valence regime , this can be attributed to the fano resonance for the electron transport through the bonding and antibonding channels in this system .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in the triply occupied regime the conductance still achieves the unitary limit even in the presence of strong interdot tunnel coupling .     for the system with two identical quantum dots .",

    "the transmission probability at different tunneling coupling @xmath12 is shown in fig.3 ( a ) . without direct interdot tunneling ( @xmath50 )",
    ", one can see that the transmission probability has the particle - hole symmetry , and the spin exchange effect between the electrons localized in the quantum dots and that in the leads gives rise to a sharp peak in the transmission probability at the fermi surface , therefore the linear conductance at zero temperature reaches the unitary limit @xmath72 , as a result of the underscreened spin 1 kondo effect . in the presence of the interdot coupling @xmath76",
    ", the particle - hole symmetry of the transmission probability is broken .",
    "when @xmath12 increases beyond a quantum critical point , a sharp dip in the transmission probability is observed .",
    "it suggests that the kondo effect and the linear conductance in this regime is strongly suppressed .",
    "therefore , there is a quantum phase transition between underscreened kondo phase and the local spin singlet phase in the ground state of this system . for two - impurity anderson model without interdot capacitive coupling , this quantum phase transition has been predicted by nishimoto et al . by using dynamic density matrix renormalization group @xcite , and itko et al .",
    "have obtained its thermodynamic properties , such as the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and entropy by nrg method @xcite .",
    "it is noted that a similar quantum phase transition is also observed in two - level single qd system with intradot spin exchange coupling by hund s rule@xcite .",
    "for dqds with rkky interaction coupled to two - channel lead , chung et al.@xcite found the quantum phase transition is from kondo screened phase to spin singlet phase . in fig.3(a ) , by further increasing the interdot coupling @xmath12 , a broad peak of transmission probability with the line shape of breit - wigner resonance is developed around the energy @xmath77 , we attribute this broad transmission peak to the electron transport through the bonding channel of electrons in the quantum dots .    in fig.3(b ) the transmission probability @xmath39 at different values of on - site coulomb interaction @xmath10 is depicted .",
    "it shows that the line shape of the @xmath39 changes significantly by varying the coulomb interaction strength @xmath10 .",
    "the line shape becomes more cusplike with decreasing @xmath10 , and it reveals that the physical properties of this underscreened kondo effect in dqd system is quite different from the spin 1/2 kondo effect . for the spin 1/2 kondo effect in single - impurity anderson model",

    "some new features are also manifested in dos for this system , one can see that the dos for the antibonding state has two side peaks nearby the fermi energy , which can be understood as a result of the effective spin - exchange interaction between the electrons in dqds by tunneling through the leads , and this feature can not be found in dqds in serial configuration@xcite . as",
    "the interdot coupling @xmath12 is large than some critical value(see fig .",

    "when interdot tunneling @xmath12 is zero or has a small value , one can see that the spin - correlation converges to a positive value as temperature decreases .",

    "it is easy to understand that the exact quantum critical value of @xmath12 will depends on the the interaction parameters , such as the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath10 , interdot capacitive coupling @xmath11 and the energy level @xmath46 , etc .",
    "in summary , we have studied the ground state and the electron transport properties of the system with dqds in parallel configuration . the strong on - site coulomb repulsion and the interdot capacitive coupling",
    "is taken into account by the nonperturbative nrg technique .",

    "the ground state of dqds exhibits a quantum phase transition from triplet state to singlet state by increasing the interdot tunneling amplitude . in the case of no interdot tunneling ,",
    "the linear conductance approaches to unitary limit in the doubly occupied regime due to the underscreened kondo effect , whereas it is greatly suppressed when the electrons in dqds form an singlet state with the interdot coupling @xmath12 being larger than the critical value .",
    "for the dqds with strong interdot tunneling , the fano resonance can be observed in the linear conductance when the system are in the mixed valence regime .",
