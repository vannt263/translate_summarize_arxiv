    "many natural and artificial systems have a network structure , with nodes representing typical system units and edges playing the role of interactions between connected pairs of units .",
    "complex networks can be used to model various kinds of real - life systems ( social , economic , technological , biological ) , and to analyze processes taking place on them @xcite . in recent years , various network models",
    "have been designed capturing aspects of real systems , thus allowing to explain empirical data in several fields .",
    "this is the case of small - world @xcite and scale - free networks @xcite , which provide us with the underlying topological structure to analyze processes such as signal propagation @xcite , as well as the spread of information @xcite , opinions @xcite and infections @xcite .",
    "these types of networks have been also used to study statistical physical problems as percolation @xcite and cooperative phenomena @xcite .    in",
    "scale - free ( sf ) networks the degree distribution @xmath16 , where @xmath1 is the number of links connected to a node , has a power - law decay @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this type of networks have been found in several real - life systems , such as the internet @xcite , the world - wide web @xcite , protein interaction networks @xcite , and social systems @xcite . in both natural and artificial systems ,",
    "the exponent @xmath2 controlling the degree distribution is usually in the range @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the origin of power - law degree distributions was studied by barabsi and albert @xcite , who found that two ingredients can explain the scale - free nature of networks , namely growth and preferential attachment .",
    "more general models based on these ingredients have appeared later in the literature @xcite .",
    "one can also deal with equilibrium sf networks , defined as statistical ensembles of random networks with a given degree distribution @xmath20 , for which one may analyze several properties as a function of the exponent @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "many real - life networks include clustering , i.e. , the probability of finding loops of small size is larger than in random networks .",
    "this has been in particular quantified by the so - called clustering coefficient , which measures the likelihood of `` triangles '' in a network @xcite .",
    "most network models employed in the past did not include clustering . some of them , such as the watts - strogatz small - world model @xcite show clustering , but are not well - suited as models of most actual networks .",
    "several computational models of clustered networks have been defined along the years @xcite , but in general their properties can not be calculated by analytical procedures . in last years , it was shown that generalized random graphs can be generated incorporating clustering in such a way that exact formulas can be derived for many of their properties .",
    "this is the case of the networks defined by newman @xcite and miller @xcite .",
    "cooperative phenomena in complex networks are known to display characteristics related to the particular topology of these systems @xcite .",
    "the ising model on sf networks has been studied by using several theoretical techniques @xcite , and its critical behavior was found to depend on the exponent @xmath2 .",
    "two different regimes appear for uncorrelated networks .",
    "on one side , for an exponent @xmath3 , the average value @xmath15 is finite in the large - size limit , and there appears a ferromagnetic ( fm ) to paramagnetic ( pm ) transition at a finite temperature @xmath21 . on the other side , when @xmath15 diverges ( as happens for @xmath6 ) , the system remains in its ordered fm phase at any temperature , so that there is no phase transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ising model has been also studied in scale - free networks , where spin - glass phases have been found @xcite .",
    "all this refers to unclustered random networks with a power - law degree distribution .",
    "one may ask how this picture changes when the networks are clustered , i.e. , the clustering coefficient has a non - negligible value . in principle , one expects that the presence of small loops in the networks will enhance correlations between spins located on network nodes , thus favoring ordered schemes such as an fm pattern .",
    "thus , the effects of clustering on various cooperative phenomena in complex networks have been studied earlier .",
    "this is the case of percolation @xcite , epidemics @xcite , and dynamical processes @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the ising model on networks with arbitrary distribution of motifs using an analytical procedure , the so - called belief - propagation algorithm . for the networks considered in that paper , where the thermodynamic limit is well defined ( @xmath21 converges for @xmath5 ) , these authors found that clustering increases the critical temperature in comparison with tree - like networks with the same mean degree , but does not change the critical behavior .",
    "in this paper we study the fm - pm transition for the ising model in scale - free networks with clustering , which is realized by introducing triangles in the networks , i.e. , three - membered loops .",
    "several values of the exponent @xmath2 are considered , as well as various concentrations of triangles .",
    "we employ monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to obtain the transition temperature , when it is well defined ( for @xmath3 ) , and to derive the size dependence of the crossover temperature for cases where @xmath15 diverges as @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the clustered networks considered here . in sec .",
    "iii we present the computational method employed to carry out mc simulations . in sec .",
    "iv we present results of the simulations and a discussion for the different parameter regions , depending on the value of the exponent @xmath2 ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , or @xmath24 ) .",
    "the paper closes with a summary in sec .",
    "we consider clustered networks with a degree distribution @xmath16 that follows the power - law dependence @xmath18 for large degree @xmath1 .",
    "clustering is included by inserting triangles in the networks , i.e. , triads of connected nodes .",
    "other kinds of polygons ( squares , pentagons , ... ) can be introduced to study their effect on critical phenomena in physical systems , but we choose triangles since they cause stronger correlations between entities defined on network sites , as in the case of the ising model considered here .",
    "we generate networks by following the method proposed by newman @xcite , where one separately specifies the number of edges and the number of triangles .",
    "this procedure allows one to generalize random graphs to incorporate clustering in a simple way , so that exact formulas can be derived for many properties of the resulting networks @xcite .        for a network of size @xmath25 ( number of nodes ) , we call @xmath26 the number of triangles in which node @xmath27 takes part , and @xmath28 the number of single edges not included in the triangles .",
    "this means that edges within the triangles are listed separately from single links .",
    "thus , a single link can be viewed as a network element joining together two nodes and a triangle as an element connecting three nodes .",
    "the degree @xmath29 of node @xmath27 is then @xmath30 , as each triangle connects it to two other nodes .",
    "a picture of such a network is presented in fig .  1 , where triangles are indicated with asterisks ( * ) .    to generate the networks , we first define the edges .",
    "we assign to each node @xmath27 a random number @xmath28 , which represents the number of outgoing links from this node ( stubs ) .",
    "the set of numbers @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 , the minimum allowed degree ) is taken from the probability distribution @xmath33 @xcite , giving a total number of stubs @xmath34 .",
    "we impose the restriction that @xmath35 must be an even integer .",
    "then , we connect stubs at random ( giving a total of @xmath36 connections ) , with the conditions : ( i ) no two nodes can have more than one bond connecting them ( no multiple connections ) , and ( ii ) no node can be connected by a link to itself ( no self - connections ) .    in a second step",
    "we introduce triangles into the networks .",
    "their number @xmath37 is controlled by the parameter @xmath38 , which gives the mean number of triangles in which a generic node is included ( @xmath39 ) . the number of triangles @xmath26 associated to a node @xmath27 is drawn from a poisson distribution @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath26 `` corners '' associated to node @xmath27 , and the total number is @xmath41 .",
    "we impose the condition that @xmath42 be a multiple of 3 .",
    "then , we take triads of corners uniformly at random to form triangles , taking into account conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) above to avoid multiple and self - connections .",
    "note that single links can by chance form triangles .",
    "calling @xmath43 the number of such triangles , their density @xmath44 for a given mean degree @xmath14 vanishes as @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , @xmath45 scales as @xmath46 for large @xmath25 @xcite .    in complex networks ,",
    "one usually defines the clustering coefficient @xmath47 as the ratio @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of connected triplets @xcite : @xmath50 thus , for the networks discussed here , we have @xmath51 and the clustering coefficient can be changed as a function of the parameter @xmath38 .    aside from @xmath2 and the triangle density @xmath38 , our networks are defined by the minimum degree @xmath52 .",
    "since we are interested in finite - size effects , the network size @xmath25 is also an important variable in our discussion .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath16 obtained for networks generated by following the procedure described above is presented in fig .  2 .",
    "in this figure , we have plotted @xmath16 for networks including @xmath53 nodes , with @xmath8 and @xmath54 .",
    "each curve corresponds to a particular value of the parameter @xmath38 = 0 , 1 , and 2 , including in each case an average over 200 network realizations . comparing the curves corresponding to different @xmath38 values",
    ", one observes that the introduction of triangles in the networks causes clear changes in the distribution @xmath16 for small @xmath1 values .",
    "however , for large degrees , the distribution is found to follow the dependence @xmath18 typical of scale - free networks , with @xmath8 in the present case .",
    "this could be expected , since the poisson distribution @xmath55 associated to the triangles has a much faster exponential - like decay for large @xmath56 . in the three cases shown in fig .  2",
    "there appears an effective cutoff @xmath57 , which is related to the finite size @xmath25 of the networks ( see below ) .",
    "we note that a maximum degree @xmath17 was explicitly introduced earlier in scale - free networks for computational convenience @xcite .    an important characteristic of the considered networks , that will be employed below to discuss the results of the ising model , is the mean degree @xmath14 . for scale - free networks with @xmath58 ,",
    "the mean degree is given by @xmath59 where the last expression is obtained by replacing the sum by an integral , which is justified for large @xmath25 .",
    "note that we assume here @xmath60 and that the distribution @xmath20 is normalized to unity ( for @xmath61 the mean degree @xmath14 diverges in the large - size limit : @xmath62 ) .",
    "then , for our networks including triangles , one has @xmath63    for finite networks ,",
    "a size effect is expected to appear in the mean degree , as a consequence of the effective cutoff appearing in the degree distribution ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .  3 , where we present @xmath14 vs @xmath64 , for our generated networks with @xmath8 and @xmath54 .",
    "the mean degree decreases as @xmath64 increases , i.e. , @xmath14 increases as the system size is raised .",
    "the data shown in fig .  3 for @xmath38 = 0 , 1 , and 2 ,",
    "follow a linear dependence , and in fact can be fitted as @xmath65 , at least in the region plotted in the figure ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the fit parameter @xmath67 is close to the mean degree @xmath68 given in eq .",
    "( [ kmean ] ) , and the small difference is mainly due to the replacement of sums by integrals in the derivation of that equation .",
    "note that for @xmath8 , @xmath58 and @xmath54 , eq .",
    "( [ kmean ] ) yields @xmath68 = 6 .",
    "the slope @xmath69 obtained from the linear fits turns out to be the same ( within statistical noise ) for the three cases shown in fig .",
    "this size dependence of @xmath14 can be understood by noting that the effective cutoff @xmath17 appearing in a power - law degree distribution is related with the network size @xmath25 by the expression @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a constant on the order of unity . from this expression",

    "_ @xcite found that appreciable correlations appear between degrees of adjacent nodes when no multiple and self - connections are allowed .",

    "this means that for networks with given size @xmath25 and mean degree @xmath14 , including triangles in the networks ( i.e. , increasing the triangle density @xmath38 ) reduces the crossover temperature @xmath7 .",
    "the reason for this is the following . to have a constant @xmath14 when changing @xmath38 for a given @xmath2 ( @xmath8 here ) , one needs a minimum degree @xmath148 [ see eq .",
    "( [ kmean ] ) ] , so that a rise of @xmath38 is associated to a decrease in @xmath52 .",

    "when one includes triangles ( @xmath38 increases ) without changing the other parameters defining the networks ( i.e. , @xmath25 , @xmath52 , @xmath2 ) , one finds a clear increase in @xmath7 , as shown in fig .",
    "6 . however , if one changes @xmath38 subject to some particular restriction on the degree distribution , such as keeping constant the mean value @xmath14 , one may find other types of dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath38 ( as the decrease shown in fig .",
    "this suggests that a relevant point here is a comparison between clustered and unclustered networks with the same degree distribution @xmath16",
