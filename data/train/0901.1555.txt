    "<S> we discuss how the reflective scattering would affect elastic scattering in the region of small and moderate values of @xmath0 , in particular , we demonstrate that diffractive pattern in the angular distribution will be kept in a modified form .    diffraction is a fascinating subject in the light of coming experiments at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the term diffraction was introduced to the hadron and nuclei scattering with use of optical analogy . </S>",
    "<S> this adoption was based on the striking similarities observed in hadron and nuclei scattering and light diffraction by absorbing obstacles . the absorption in hadron and nuclei scattering </S>",
    "<S> is considered to be a result of opening many inelastic channels at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> angular distribution in this absorptive approach has typical diffraction pattern with prominent forward peak and secondary maxima and minima and can be associated with wave properties of particle scattering .    in the recent paper @xcite we considered saturation of the unitarity condition for scattering matrix in hadron collisions at small impact parameters , when scattering acquires reflective nature , i.e. @xmath1 at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> approach to the full absorption in head - on collisions  the limit @xmath3 at @xmath2  does not follow from unitarity itself and is merely a result of the assumed saturation of the black disk limit . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the reflective scattering is a natural interpretation of the unitarity saturation based on the optical concepts in high energy hadron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> such reflective scattering can be traced to the continuous increasing density of the scatterer with energy , i.e. when density goes beyond some critical value relevant for the black disk limit saturation , the scatterer starts to acquire a reflective ability . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of reflective scattering itself is quite general , and results from the @xmath4-matrix unitarity saturation related to the necessity to provide the total cross section growth at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this picture predicts that the scattering amplitude at the lhc energies is beyond the black disk limit at small impact parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the prediction for the total , elastic and inelastic cross - sections have been discussed in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> reflective scattering should have also consequences for the differential cross - section of elastic scattering , in the region of small and moderate values of @xmath0 . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , it is not evident that the presence of the reflective scattering would lead to diffractive angular distributions with diffraction peak followed by dips and bumps . </S>",
    "<S> it will be shown further on that diffraction pattern will be kept in a slightly modified form in this case .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with unitarity condition for the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath5 which can be written in the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the corresponding elastic and inelastic overlap function introduced by van hove @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> physical meaning of each term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ un ] ) is evident from the graphical representation in fig . 1 .     in the graphical form . </S>",
    "<S> _ ]    </S>",
    "<S> the functions @xmath7 are related to the functions @xmath8 and via the fourier - bessel transforms , i.e. @xmath9 the elastic and inelastic cross  </S>",
    "<S> sections can be obtained as follows : @xmath10 as it was already noted , the reflective scattering appears naturally in the @xmath11matrix form of unitarization . in the @xmath11matrix approach , the @xmath12 scattering matrix element in the impact parameter representation is the following linear fractional transform : @xmath13 @xmath14 is the generalized reaction matrix , which is considered to be an input dynamical quantity . </S>",
    "<S> the relation ( [ um ] ) is one - to - one transform and easily invertible . </S>",
    "<S> inelastic overlap function @xmath15 is connected with @xmath14 by the relation @xmath16 and the only condition to obey unitarity is @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> elastic overlap function is related to the function @xmath14 as follows @xmath18 the form of @xmath14 depends on the particular model assumptions , but for our qualitative purposes it is sufficient that it increases with energy in a power - like way and decreases with impact parameter like a linear exponent or gaussian . to simplify the qualitative picture </S>",
    "<S> , we consider also the function @xmath14 as a pure imaginary . at sufficiently high energies ( @xmath19 ) , the two separate regions of impact parameter distances can be anticipated , namely the outer region of peripheral collisions where the scattering has a typical absorptive origin , i.e. @xmath20 and the inner region of central collisions where the scattering has a combined reflective and absorptive origin , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition to the negative values of @xmath4 leads to appearance of the real part of the phase shift , i.e. @xmath22 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted here that the quasi - eikonal form of unitarization allows smooth transition to the reflective scattering mode also . </S>",
    "<S> unitarity condition can be obeyed then ( beyond the inelastic threshold only ) for a special class of the eikonal functions @xcite .    in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the impact parameter profiles of elastic and inelastic overlap functions for the scattering picture with reflection and for the widely accepted absorptive scattering approach in order to make a conclusion on the absence or presence of the dips and bumps in the differential cross - section of elastic scattering , which are associated with the zeroes of @xmath23 ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the well known absorptive picture of high energy scattering corresponding to the black disk limit at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this limit has already been reached in the head - on proton  antiproton collisions at tevatron , i.e. @xmath24 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one can expect that in the framework of absorptive picture , black disk limit will be reached also at @xmath25 at higher energies and the impact parameter profiles of @xmath26 and @xmath15 will be similar and have a form close to step function ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) .        </S>",
    "<S> the elastic and inelastic overlap functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 will have similar dependence on @xmath0 which can be approximately described as @xmath29 zeroes and maxima of the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 are located at the same values of @xmath0 , they will not compensate each other . as a result differential cross  </S>",
    "<S> section of elastic scattering will have well known form wityh dips and bumps @xmath30 when the absorptive scattering picture is realized . in this case @xmath31 of course , presence of real part of the scattering amplitude and/or contributions from helicity flip amplitudes @xcite can modify the diffraction picture and bring the uncertainty into the above conclusion , but we can suppose that those effects are not significant at very high energies .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider now energy evolution of the elastic and inelastic overlap functions in the scattering picture which includes reflective scattering . with conventional parameterizations of the @xmath11matrix the inelastic overlap function increases with energies at modest values of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> it reaches its maximum value @xmath33 at some energy @xmath34 and beyond this energy the reflective scattering mode appears at small values of @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the region of energies and impact parameters corresponding to the reflective scattering mode is determined by the conditions @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the unitarity limit and black disk limit are the same for the inelastic overlap function , but these limits are different for the elastic overlap function . </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative analysis of the experimental data @xcite gives the threshold value : @xmath38 tev . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath15 becomes peripheral when energy increases in the region @xmath19 . at such energies the inelastic overlap function reaches its maximum at @xmath39 where @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> so , in the energy region , which lies beyond the transition threshold , there are two regions in impact parameter space : the central region of reflective scattering combined with absorptive scattering at @xmath41 and the peripheral region of pure absorptive scattering at @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> typical pattern of the impact parameter profiles for elastic and inelastic overlap functions in the scattering picture with reflection at the lhc energies is depicted on fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .        elastic and inelastic overlap functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 will also have different dependencies on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> they can be approximately described as following @xmath43 but @xmath44 and @xmath45 in another words , @xmath27 dominates over @xmath28 at @xmath46 , but it is not the case for the scattering in the non - forward directions . in this region </S>",
    "<S> these two functions have similar energy dependencies proportional to @xmath47 at rather large fixed values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean impact parameter values for elastic and inelastic interactions have also similar energy dependencies @xmath48 but the value of impact parameter averaged over all interactions @xmath49 acquires the main contribution from elastic scattering according to eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ tasel ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the inelastic intermediate states will give subleading contribution to the slope of diffraction cone @xmath50 , @xmath51 at asymptotical energies . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , since @xmath52 , it can be written in the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 , while @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that both terms @xmath56 and @xmath57 are proportional to @xmath58 in case of the absorptive scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the reflective scattering behavior of the function @xmath28 is determined by a peripheral impact parameter profile and its @xmath0 dependence is different . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the elastic overlap function @xmath27 has similarities with that function in the case of absorptive approach dependence . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , zeroes and maxima of the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 will be located at different values of @xmath0 and zeroes and maxima of @xmath59 will also be located at different position in the cases of absorptive and the reflective scattering . in the case of reflective scattering , </S>",
    "<S> dips and maxima will be located in the region of lower values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to note that the presence of reflective scattering enhances the large @xmath0 region by factor @xmath60 compared to absorptive scattering . </S>",
    "<S> despite that these two mechanisms lead at the asymptotics to the significant differences in the total , elastic and inelastic cross - section dependencies , their predictions for the differential cross - section of elastic scattering are not so much different at small and moderate values of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> we do not consider here the specific model predictions for the differential cross - sections ; our aim was to demonstrate that diffraction picture with dips and bumps in the differential cross - section will be kept in the case when the reflective scattering dominates . </S>"
