    "in the beginning 90 's , the mller scattering was adopted as a theoretical tool to investigate the possible formation of electron - electron bound states in the context of a maxwell - chern - simons electrodynamics @xcite . according to this procedure , one starts from the scattering amplitude ( carried out at tree - level ) to obtain the electron - electron interaction potential ( born approximation ) . as a settled down result , it was observed that the potential may come out negative whenever the topological mass exceeds the electron mass @xmath1 , condition which is particularly discouraging in relation to the possibility of applying this kind of model to some condensed matter systems , where one usually deals with low - energy excitations . the introduction of the higgs sector , arising from the spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite , has shown to be a theoretical factor able to provide a scalar attractive interaction .",
    "the overall potential , consisting in the sum of the gauge and scalar contributions , may then be negative independently of the condition @xmath2 , a necessary premise for the formation of cooper pairs in the context of low - energy systems .    in the latest years",
    ", lorentz - violating theories have been in focus of intensive investigation @xcite,@xcite . in a recent work ,",
    "a planar lorentz - violating electrodynamics @xcite was derived from the dimensional reduction of a maxwell electrodynamics supplemented with the carroll - field - jackiw ( cfj ) term @xcite .",
    "the consistency of this model has already been analyzed , revealing a model globally stable , causal and unitary for both time- and spacelike backgrounds @xcite .",
    "the fact that the unitarity is assured makes feasible , at principle , the consistent quantization of this model , which sets it up as a candidate to be applied to situations where the quantization of the modes is a real condition ( such as some condensed matter phenomena ) . in a posterior investigation @xcite ,",
    "the equations of motion ( for the field strengths and potentials ) corresponding to this planar model were determined and solved in the static regime .",
    "the results obtained differ from the solutions of a pure mcs electrodynamics by background - depending corrections , which amount to relevant qualitative modifications .",
    "indeed , the solutions have exhibited a typical massless behavior ( in the electric sector ) for the case of a timelike background and anisotropic behavior for the case of a spacelike background .",
    "it was also reported the possibility of obtaining an attractive electron - electron interaction as a consequence of the existence of  well region in the behavior of the scalar potential @xmath3 .",
    "lorentz covariance is certainly an essential feature of any relativistic system , mainly for ensuring the equivalence between all inertial frames .",
    "once lorentz symmetry is broken , such equivalence is lost , and each inertial frame starts to notice a different physics .",
    "it is a well known fact that condensed matter systems ( cms ) are not endowed with lorentz covariance , but with galileo one , which holds as a genuine symmetry in the domain of isotropic low - energy systems .",
    "having in mind that a cms may be addressed as the low - energy limit of a relativistic model , there follows a straightforward correspondence between the breakdown of lorentz and galileo symmetries , in the sense that a cms with  violation of galileo symmetry may have as counterpart a relativistic system endowed with breaking of lorentz covariance .",
    "theoretical planar models able to provide attractive @xmath4 interaction  potentials are relevant in the sense they may constitute a suitable framework to address the condensation of cooper pairs , a fundamental characteristic of superconducting systems . another well defined feature of a planar high - tc superconductor concerns the symmetry of the order parameter ( standing for the cooper pair ) , which is described in terms of a spatially anisotropic d - wave @xcite . a theoretical framework able to provide an anisotropic @xmath4 interaction is the first step to the achievement of anisotropy for the order parameter .",
    "this is exactly the expected result to be obtained in the case a pure spacelike background , where the @xmath4 scattering potential may be identified with the one evaluated in the context of a cms endowed with a privileged direction in space .",
    "therefore , once an anisotropic cms constitutes  an example where the breakdown of the galileo symmetry takes place , such a system may be properly approached as the low - energy limit of a lorentz - violating electrodynamics in the presence of a pure spacelike background .    having as main motivation the results achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite , which show that a fixed background induces sensitive effects at classical solutions , in this work one investigates the tree - level behavior of two interacting fermions in the context of a lorentz - violating electrodynamics . by determining of the @xmath4 interaction potential",
    ", one can verify to what extent the properties reported in the classical static analysis  @xcite are preserved in the context a dynamic  evaluation .",
    "one can also study the possibility of achieving an @xmath4 interaction endowed with two relevant features : attractiveness and anisotropy , relevant properties in superconducting systems .",
    "hence , the purpose is to carry out the @xmath5  interaction potential , exhibiting and stressing the corrections induced by the fixed background on the pure maxwell - chern - simons result .",
    "for that , one first introduces the dirac sector to the planar lorentz - violating gauge model derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . taking into account the guidelines set up in refs.@xcite , @xcite",
    ", one then proceeds to evaluate the mller scattering amplitude from which one derives the @xmath4 interaction ( according to the born approximation ) .",
    "the potential here attained is composed by two contributions , a scalar and a gauge one , since the @xmath4 interaction is mediated by the massless scalar and the massive gauge fields . the scalar potential , absent in the context of a pure mcs model , is always negative , and may lead to a global attractive interaction regardless the sign of the gauge contribution . in the case of the gauge potential , it presents background - depending terms that imply qualitative modifications , such as the possibility of being attractive for some parameters range , even when considered in the presence of the centrifugal barrier and the low - energy @xmath6 pauli term .",
    "both the scalar and gauge potential possess a logarithm dependence , which is compatible with a massless behavior far from the origin .",

    "the interaction potential was calculated as the fourier transform of the scattering amplitude ( born approximation ) carried out in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "the interaction potential exhibits two distinct contributions : the attractive scalar one ( stemming form the yukawa exchange ) and the gauge one ( mediated by the mcs - proca gauge field ) .",
    "the scalar yukawa interaction , as expected , turns out to be always negative .",
    "this makes feasible a global attractive potential , regardless the character ( repulsive or attractive ) of the gauge potential . in practice",
    ", such an interaction may be identified with phonon exchange processes , which represent physical excitations in several systems of interest . as for the gauge interaction , it is composed by a pure mcs potential corrected by background - depending contributions , which impose relevant physical modifications .",
    "the absence of screening , first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , becomes now manifest in the context of a dynamical computation ( by means of an ubiquitous logarithmic term ) , confirming the conclusion that @xmath64 is not a dynamical pole @xcite .",
    "the background - depending corrections are such that they lead to an attractive gauge potential for some values of the parameters , which constitutes a promising result in connection with the possibility of obtaining the formation of cooper pairs .",
    "this possibility can be appropriately checked up by means of a quantum - mechanical numerical analysis of the interaction potential here derived , which should be performed by means of the numerical solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "such analysis must provide the corresponding @xmath4 binding energy once one takes suitable values for the parameters ( in accordance with the scale of low - energy excitations typical in condensed matter systems ) .",
    "a natural extension of this work consists in studying the interaction potential for the case of a purely spacelike background@xcite .",
    "such an evaluation will certainly reveal an anisotropic potential in relation to the privileged direction fixed by the background , which may lead to an attractive interaction as well as an anisotropic @xmath4 order parameter .    in ( 1 + 2 ) dimensions ,",
    "the purely coulombian interaction is associated with a logarithmic dependence , which implies in a confining rather than a binding behavior , which is ubiquitous in the results of this paper .",
    "however , the same can be eliminated if the gauge field exhibits an additional mass component , as the proca term . indeed , in a recent work @xcite it was accomplished the dimensional reduction of an abelian - higgs lorentz - violating model endowed with the cfj term , resulting in a planar maxwell - chern - simons - proca electrodynamics coupled to a massive klein - gordon field @xmath15 .",
    "a particular feature of this kind of higgs model is the presence of totally screened modes : all its physical excitations are massive , which yields screened interactions . * *  * * the consideration of the mller scattering in this framework will lead to an entirely shielded interaction potential , once the logarithmic term should be suitably replaced by a k@xmath40 function .",
