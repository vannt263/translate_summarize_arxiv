    "only a few other stars are known to host as many planets : hd  10180 ( lovis et al .",
    "2011 ) , kepler-11 ( lissauer et al .",
    "2011 ) , and the sun . among the other reasons why 55  cnc has attracted attention",
    "are the 3:1 resonance between two of its planets ( novak et al .",
    "2003 ) , the existence of an m dwarf companion at a distance of 10@xmath12  au ( mugrauer et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the unusually low mass and short period of its innermost planet , designated `` e '' .",
    "mcarthur et al .  ( 2004 ) reported a period and minimum mass for 55  cnc  e of 2.8  d and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "those parameters were confirmed by fischer et al .",
    "more recently , dawson & fabrycky ( 2010 ) argued that 55  cnc  e had been mischaracterized due to aliasing in the radial - velocity data , and that the true period and minimum mass are @xmath14  d and @xmath15  @xmath6 .",
    "one implication of the shorter period would be an increased transit probability , from 13% to 25% .",
    "the occurrence of transits enhances the importance of an exoplanetary system , because transits can reveal many details about the planet s dimensions , atmosphere , and orbit ( see , e.g. , winn 2010 ) .",
    "fischer et al .  ( 2008 ) searched for transits in their 11-year photometric record , ruling out transits for planets b ( @xmath16  d ) and c ( 44.3  d ) .",
    "however , the time coverage was not complete enough to rule out transits for planets f ( 260  d ) and d ( 5200  d ) , and the precision was insufficient to detect transits of the smallest planet e.    here , we present space - based photometry of 55  cnc revealing a transit signal with the characteristics predicted by dawson & fabrycky ( 2010 ) .",
    "section 2 presents the data , and section 3 presents the light curve analysis , yielding estimates for the mass , radius , and density of the planet . in section 4",
    "we place 55  cnc  e in the context of the small but growing population of super - earths with measured masses and radii .",
    "while this manuscript was under review , we learned that demory et al .",
    "( 2011 ) detected a transit of 55  cnc with the _ spitzer space telescope_. we refer the reader to that work for a complementary analysis of the system properties .",
    "we observed 55  cnc with _ most _ ( microvariability & oscillations of stars ) , a canadian microsatellite equipped with a 15  cm telescope and ccd photometer , capable of short - cadence , long - duration ultraprecise optical photometry of bright stars ( walker et al .",
    "2003 , matthews et al .",
    "_ most _ is in a sun - synchronous polar orbit 820  km above the terminator with an orbital period of 101  min .",
    "its custom broadband filter covers the visible spectrum ( 350 - 700  nm ) .",
    "we used the direct imaging mode , similar to conventional ground - based ccd photometry .",
    "the observations were nearly continuous from 2011  february 07 - 22 , except for a few interruptions when cosmic ray hits during passages through the south atlantic anomaly resulted in the loss of fine tracking .",
    "individual exposures lasted 0.5  s but were downloaded in stacks of 40 for the first 0.6  d , and stacks of 80 for the remaining 14.4  d.    aperture photometry was performed on the direct imaging subraster of the science ccd .",
    "data affected by cosmic rays , image motion , or other problems were identified and removed . to improve the homogeneity of the data , we omitted data from the first 0.6  d ( which had a different effective exposure time ) and the final 2.1  d ( which suffered from a tracking loss followed by a major shift in image registration ) .",
    "the final time series has 18,373 data points and a time sampling of 43  s outside of the interruptions .",
    "further processing was needed to remove the familiar periodic artifacts in the time series due to scattered earthshine .",
    "first , the observed magnitude of 55  cnc was fitted to a linear function of the background level , @xmath17 position , and @xmath18 position , and then this function was subtracted from the observed magnitudes .",
    "the fourier spectrum still had significant peaks at the 14.26  c  d@xmath19 orbital frequency of the satellite and its harmonics , as well as sidelobes at @xmath201  c  d@xmath19 away from those frequencies ( arising from the modulation of the stray light by the earth s albedo pattern as viewed by the satellite ) .",
    "for this reason , an additional correction was performed with the `` running averaged background '' method of rucinski et al .",
    "the data were divided into 5 time intervals , each spanning approximately 32 _ most _ orbits ( 2.3  d ) . within each interval ,",
    "the data were folded with the satellite s orbital period and boxcar - smoothed , giving a reconstruction of the stray - light waveform during that time interval .",
    "this waveform was then subtracted from the observed magnitudes .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : lc ] shows the final time series , and the lower two panels show the data after folding with the dawson & fabrycky  ( 2010 ) ephemeris .",
    "a dip is observed at nearly zero phase , where the transit signal would be expected .",
    "in addition , a gradual rise in flux is observed away from zero phase , which is evident in the middle panel , and which has been subtracted in the lower panel based on the model described in   3 .",
    "we emphasize that the signal shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] is not the outcome of a period search : the data were phased with the _ predicted _ ephemeris .",
    "nevertheless , when a period search is performed the strongest signal is at 0.74  d , as shown in figure  [ fig : bls ] .",
    "the signal has the predicted period , and the observed epoch is bracketed by the two predicted epochs of dawson & fabrycky  ( 2010 ) .",
    "it is 37  min later than the circular - orbit prediction and 21  min earlier than the eccentric - orbit prediction .",
    "furthermore the depth and duration of the signal conform with expectations ( see   3 ) . with close matches to four predicted parameters ( period , phase , depth , and duration )",
    "we consider the existence of transits to be established .",
    "a transit model was fitted to the light curve based on the formulas of mandel & agol ( 2002 ) , and the monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) code of holman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and winn et al .",
    "the orbit was assumed to be circular , and the stellar limb - darkening law was assumed to be quadratic . to model the out - of - transit variation seen in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : lc ] , we added a term @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the orbital phase relative to midtransit . for completeness",
    "the model also included an occultation at @xmath23 , although occultations were not detected .",
    "the model parameters were the planet - to - star radius ratio @xmath24 , star - to - orbit radius ratio @xmath25 , orbital inclination @xmath26 , time of midtransit @xmath27 , amplitude of the orbital phase modulation @xmath28 , occultation depth @xmath29 , flux normalization ( taken to be the flux just outside of transit ) , and limb - darkening coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "uniform priors were adopted for @xmath24 , @xmath32 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the flux normalization .",
    "we used gaussian priors on the stellar radius and mass , @xmath33  @xmath4 and @xmath34 , which together act as a prior on @xmath25 .",
    "the radius prior is based on the interferometrically measured stellar radius ( von braun et al .",
    "2011 ) , and the mass prior is based on the analysis of the stellar spectroscopic properties by takeda et al .",
    "priors on the limb - darkening coefficients were based on theoretical values @xmath35 and @xmath36 , obtained by integrating a kurucz model with effective temperature 5327  k and @xmath37 over the _ most _ bandpass .",
    "the sum @xmath38 was subject to a gaussian prior with dispersion 0.1 , and the difference @xmath39 ( which has a negligible effect ) was held fixed at the theoretical value .    the likelihood was taken to be @xmath40 with the usual sum - of - squares definition of @xmath41 .",
    "the 1@xmath42 uncertainty in each data point was taken to be the root - mean - square ( rms ) out - of - transit flux multiplied by a factor @xmath43 intended to take into account the time - correlated noise .",
    "the factor @xmath43 is the ratio between the standard deviation of residuals binned to 15  min , and the standard deviation one would expect based on the unbinned data assuming white noise ( see , e.g. , pont et al .",
    "2006 , carter & winn 2009 ) .",
    "the rms and @xmath43 values were 101  ppm and 1.3 , respectively .",
    "table  [ tbl : params ] gives the results .",
    "to further investigate the effects of the correlated noise and stray - light removal algorithms on the fitted transit parameters , we injected and recovered fake transit signals .",
    "beginning with the aperture photometry , we subtracted the best - fitting transit model and added a fake signal with a different period and transit time .",
    "the fake signal had the same transit depth , duration ( in phase units ) , @xmath28 and @xmath29 as the best - fitting model .",
    "then , we processed the data just as was done with the undoctored data .",
    "this was repeated for @xmath44 randomly chosen periods within 50% of the true period .",
    "the recovered values of the transit and occultation depths had a scatter of 47  ppm , in excess of the statistical error of 15  ppm , and were systematically smaller by 1.9% than the injected depths .",
    "the fitted orbital phase modulations had a scatter of 68  ppm , in excess of the statistical error of 15  ppm , and the amplitudes were 6.4% smaller than the injected values .",
    "table  [ tbl : params ] reports the values after correcting for these biases and increased dispersions .",
    "both the mass and radius of 55  cnc  e are known to within 10% , providing a valuable example with which to test theoretical models of super - earth structure . to provide a broad view , the left panel of figure  [ fig : mr ] shows the masses and radii of the transiting exoplanets , along with theoretical curves taken from seager et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for `` mathematicians planets '' composed of pure hydrogen , water , rock ( mgsio@xmath45 perovskite ) and iron .",
    "the right panel focuses on the super - earths and shows the contours of constant mean density , along with some theoretical curves based on more detailed models .",
    "55  cnc  e falls between the rock and water lines , suggesting it is neither a gaseous planet , nor is it simply a scaled - up terrestrial planet .",
    "although the mean density of 55  cnc  e is similar to that of earth , the greater compression of the interior of 55  cnc  e implies that it has a different composition .",
    "the _ uncompressed _ density of 55  cnc  e would be smaller than that of earth , implying that any rock and iron must be accompanied by water , gas , or other light elements .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : mr ] also shows that the known super - earths span a factor of 20 in mean density , implying a correspondingly large range of possibilities for composition and internal structure . a striking contrast exists between 55  cnc  e and kepler-11e , which have similar masses but densities differing by a factor of 10 .",
    "any atmosphere around 55  cnc  e would be strongly heated , as the planet is located less than 4  @xmath46 from its host star .",
    "the planetary temperature at the substellar point would be @xmath47  k if the planet has a low albedo , its rotation is synchronized with its orbit and the incoming heat is reradiated locally .",
    "if instead the heat is redistributed evenly over the planet s surface , the zero - albedo equilibrium temperature is @xmath48  k.    atmospheres of transiting planets can be studied through occultations and orbital phase variations ( see , e.g. , knutson et al .",
    "our analysis did not reveal occultations ( @xmath49  ppm ) , but did reveal a phase modulation ( @xmath50  ppm ) .",
    "however , we can not attribute the modulation to the changing illuminated fraction of 55  cnc  e , for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the occultation depth is smaller than the full range of the sinusoidal modulation .",
    "secondly , the amplitude of the modulation is too large .",
    "reflected starlight would cause a signal no larger than @xmath51  ppm .",
    "the planet s thermal emission would produce a signal @xmath52@xmath53  ppm for bolometric observations , and only 5  ppm for observations in the _ most _ bandpass , even for a 2800  k planet .",
    "one possible explanation is that the star s planet - facing hemisphere is fainter by a fraction @xmath28 than the other hemisphere , due to star - planet interactions .",
    "the planet may induce a patch of enhanced magnetic activity , as is the case for @xmath54  boo  b ( walker et al .",
    "2008 ) . in this case ,",
    "though , the planet - induced disturbance would need to be a traveling wave , because the stellar rotation is not synchronized with the orbit .",
    "fischer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) estimated the rotation period to be @xmath55  d , and valenti & fischer ( 2005 ) found the projected rotation speed to be @xmath56  km  s@xmath19 , much slower than the synchronous value of 65  km  s@xmath19 .",
    "hence , the interpretation of the phase modulation is unclear .",
    "the power spectral density of the photometric data also displays the low - frequency envelope characteristic of stellar activity and granulation , which complicates the interpretation of gradual variations at the orbital period of 55 cnc e. confirming or refuting this candidate orbital phase modulation is a priority for future work .",
    "55 cnc e is the innermost planet in a system of at least five planets .",
    "if the orbits are coplanar and sufficiently close to 90@xmath57 inclination , then multiple planets would transit .",
    "transits of b and c were ruled out by fischer et al .",
    "however , the nondetections do not lead to constraints on mutual inclinations .",
    "given the measured inclination for planet e of @xmath58  deg , the other planets could have orbits perfectly aligned with that of planet e and still fail to transit .",
    "mcarthur et al .  ( 2004 ) reported an orbital inclination of @xmath59 for the outermost planet d , based on a preliminary investigation of _ hubble space telescope _",
    "this would imply a strong misalignment between the orbits of d and e. however , the authors noted that the astrometric dataset spanned only a limited arc of the planet s orbit , and no final results have been announced .",
    "additional astrometric measurements and analysis are warranted .",
    "figure  [ fig : obs ] shows the stellar brightness and transit depth for each of the known transiting planets .",
    "55  cnc is a uniquely bright host star , towering above the other super - earth hosts and nearly 2  mag brighter than any other transit star .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : obs ] also shows that the transit depth for 55  cnc  e is among the smallest known .",
    "this combination of factors causes the follow - up landscape for 55  cnc  e to differ from that of other planets .    the shallow depth will make certain follow - up observations challenging despite the abundance of photons . to resolve the transit ingress and egress , and",
    "thereby improve estimates of the planet s orbital inclination and absolute dimensions , it will be necessary to improve the signal - to - noise ratio in the phased light curve by observing more transits or using a larger - aperture telescope .",
    "more data are also needed to check on the candidate orbital phase modulation , and study the atmosphere through occultation spectroscopy .",
    "apart from kepler-10b , for which phase modulation was also tentatively detected ( batalha et al .  2011 ) , these effects have not yet been seen for super - earths .",
    "transit timing constraints on the system s architecture will not be easily obtained , given the shallow transit and the small amplitudes of the predicted signals .",
    "even planet b , the nearest planet to e , is expected to perturb e s transit epoch by less than 1  s over the course of its 14  d period .",
    "the most readily detectable effect may be the rmer delay due to planet d , which should cause a sinusoidal variation in planet e s transit epoch with peak - to - trough amplitude of @xmath60  s and period 5191  d.    on the other hand , follow - up observations of the star itself will continue to be rewarding .",
    "already the parallax and angular diameter of the star have been measured , the stellar variability has been tracked for 11 years ( fischer et al .",
    "2008 ) , and there is potential for the detection of @xmath61-mode oscillations that would help define the stellar properties ( see , e.g. , gilliland et al .  2011 ,",
    "nutzman et al .  2011 ) .",
    "the brightness of the star has already enabled the discovery of 4 other planets in the system , and continued monitoring has a greater potential to reveal additional bodies than is the case for fainter stars .",
