    "the detection of large numbers of high - redshift galaxies using the lyman break technique has greatly furthered our understanding of early galaxy formation . a variety of arguments , from clustering[1 ] to semi - analytic modeling[2 ] to n - body simulations[3 ] , suggest that these lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) form in highly biased , rare density peaks in the early universe .",
    "however , the nature of these galaxies remains controversial .",
    "are they the most massive galaxy contained in these peaks , having quiescently formed stars for some time[4 ] ? or are they smaller galaxies residing in large potential wells that are undergoing an short - lived merger - induced starburst[5 ] ?",
    "the key to answering this question is to determine the mass of the underlying galaxy .",
    "this may be done observationally[6 ] or by modeling processes of galaxy formation[7 ] .",
    "so far , only n - body and semi - analytic techniques have been applied , and the results vary , depending primarily on what is assumed for merger - induced starbursts . in principle , hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation including star formation , together with population synthesis models , can directly address these questions within a given cosmology .",
    "that is what we investigate in these proceedings .",
    "we simulate a random 11.111@xmath4mpc cube in a @xmath1cdm universe , with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . we use parallel treesph to advance @xmath10 gas and @xmath10 dark matter particles from @xmath11 to @xmath3 .",
    "our spatial resolution is @xmath12 comoving kpc ( equivalent plummer softening ) , implying that at @xmath3 our physical resolution is @xmath13pc .",
    "our mass resolution is @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "using a 60-particle criterion for our simulated galaxy completeness limit[8 ] implies that we are resolving most galaxies with @xmath16 .",
    "we include star formation and thermal feedback[9 ] . at @xmath3 ,",
    "we identify galaxies using spline kernel interpolative denmax ( skid ) , and compile a list of star formation events in each galaxy .",
    "since gas is gradually converted into stars in each sph particle , a given particle can have up to 20 star formation events .",
    "we treat each event as an instantaneous single - burst population using bruzual & charlot s gissel98[10 ] , assuming a scalo imf with @xmath17 .",
    "we sum the spectra for all events in a galaxy to produce its rest - frame spectrum at @xmath3 .",
    "we apply a correction for dust absorption using a galactic extinction law[11 ] with @xmath18 .",
    "we then redshift the spectra to @xmath19 and apply @xmath20 filter functions[12 ] to obtain the observed broad - band colors for our simulated galaxy population .",
    "note that no k - correction is necessary since we redshift the spectrum prior to applying the filters .",
    "our simulation produces 1238 galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "figure  1 shows the luminosity functions @xmath21 in @xmath22 ( solid histogram ) , @xmath23 ( dotted line ) and @xmath24 ( dashed line ) of these galaxies .",
    "note that @xmath25 is shown without any attenuation due to hi along the line of sight .",
    "the left and right panels show @xmath21 without and with dust , respectively .",
    "the turnover above @xmath26 is likely due to resolution effects , while the lack of galaxies with @xmath27 is due to our small volume . between these values ,",
    "our luminosity function ( with dust ) is in rough agreement with the observed @xmath22-band luminosity function  [ 13 ] , shown as the solid curve down to @xmath28 ( the current observational limit ) , although somewhat steeper . in reality",
    ", there is probably a range of dust extinctions , and this will tend to flatten @xmath21 .",

    "[ fig : lumfcn ] 0.1 in    the number of lyman break galaxies expected for this cosmology and volume is @xmath29  [ 1,13 ] , though this number could be higher due to source confusion  [ 15 ]",
    ". with dust included , we produce 7 galaxies with @xmath30 , of which 6 satisfy the lbg color selection , in reasonable agreement with observations . without dust , there are 38 .",
    "not surprisingly , the number density of simulated lbgs is highly sensitive to the amount of dust included , and undoubtedly to the type and distribution of dust as well .",

    "figure  3 shows the stellar mass vs. @xmath22-band magnitude .",
    "the horizontal line demarcates @xmath36 , the magnitude limit of the observed lbg sample .",
    "while there is some scatter , the clear trend is that the brightest objects are also the most massive ones .",
    "the scatter increases to smaller masses , and is slightly larger in @xmath23 and @xmath24 , but our simulations indicate that lbgs are the most massive galaxies at @xmath3 .",

    "the brightest galaxies have been forming stars the longest , typically for over a gyr by @xmath3 .",
    "thus they contain a significant older stellar population .",
    "fainter ( and smaller ) galaxies have formed the bulk of their stars more recently .",
    "our simulation roughly reproduces the number density and luminosity function of lbgs for a reasonable value of dust extinction .",
    "it suggests that lbgs are the most massive objects at @xmath0 , and that they contain a significant older stellar population .    while this simulation puts forth a consistent picture for the nature of lbgs , we can not rule out the aforementioned alternative scenario that lbgs are smaller starbursting galaxies .",
    "the reason is that starburst regions are typically a few hundred parsecs across , and therefore below our resolution .",
    "the star formation rate in our simulations is tied primarily to the local density ( using a schmidt law ) which is limited by resolution .",
    "thus we do not effectively mimic  starbursts \" as would occur in a much higher resolution merger simulation[14 ] .",
    "conversely , some semi - analytic models insert such starburst behavior explicitly , so it is not surprising that they obtain different results .    at present",
    ", it is not feasible to run simulations of sufficient resolution to resolve starbursts while still modeling a random cosmological volume .",
    "furthermore , starbursts are likely to be governed by many other physical processes that we are only crudely modeling at present , such as feedback and ionization . thus we can not rule out the possibility that smaller starbursting systems also contribute to the observed lyman break galaxy population .",
    "nevertheless , our simulation with reasonable physical parameters is able to reproduce the basic observed properties of this population without including such objects .",
