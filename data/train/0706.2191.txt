    "is expected to be of order one at large @xmath0 , on the order of a typical qcd mass scale , such as the renormalization mass parameter , @xmath11  mev .",
    "arguments suggest that deconfinement is a strongly first order transition , with a latent heat @xmath2 .",
    "since the free energy of @xmath12 flavors of deconfined quarks is @xmath13 in the limit of large @xmath0 , and small @xmath12 , deconfinement probably drives chiral symmetry restoration at @xmath4 .",
    "several of these features have been confirmed by numerical simulations on the lattice @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the phase diagram in the plane of temperature and quark chemical potential , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed that for all @xmath9 and @xmath5 , there is a single transition , at which both deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration occurs , shaped something like a semi - circle .",
    "if the transition is crossover for @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite , there could be a chiral critical end point in the plane of @xmath9 and @xmath5 @xcite . from numerical simulations on the lattice",
    "@xcite within errors the two transitions always appear to coincide , at least for @xmath15 and small @xmath5 .    at large @xmath0",
    ", we find a very different phase diagram in the @xmath9-@xmath5 plane , in which the deconfining and chiral transitions split from one another .",
    "for @xmath3 , the deconfining transition temperature is independent of @xmath5 . at low temperatures and densities",
    ", there is the usual confined phase of hadrons , with chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the confined phase is baryon free , as a fermi sea of baryons first forms at a value near the lightest baryon mass . within a narrow window in @xmath5 , @xmath16",
    ", there is then a rapid transition to a dense phase , with a pressure @xmath7 .",
    "the properties of dense phase(s ) are illustrated by a skyrme crystal @xcite .",
    "although the total pressure is @xmath7 , like that of quarks , the dense phases are confined , with interactions near the fermi surface dominated by baryons .",
    "we suggest that the dense phase undergoes a chiral transition for @xmath3 . in the chirally symmetric phase ,",
    "the baryons are parity doubled @xcite , consistent with the constraint of anomalies at nonzero density @xcite .    admittedly , all of our arguments are merely qualitative .",
    "even so , we think it worth pursuing them , because they are so different from naive expectation . of course our analysis",
    "could simply be an artifact of the large @xmath0 expansion , and of limited relevance to qcd , where @xmath17 . at the end",
    ", we suggest what our analysis might imply about the phase diagram of qcd .",
    "if @xmath18 is the gauge coupling , the t hooft limit is to take @xmath8 , holding @xmath19 fixed @xcite .",
    "this selects all planar diagrams of gluons . holding @xmath12 fixed as @xmath8",
    ", quark loops are suppressed , and the only states which survive have a definite number of quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "mesons are composed of one quark anti - quark pair , and are free at infinite @xmath0 : cubic interactions vanish @xmath20 , quartic interactions , @xmath21 , _ etc .",
    "_ glueballs are pure glue states , with no quarks or anti - quarks ; their cubic interaction vanish @xmath21 , and so on . except for goldstone bosons ,",
    "the lightest bosons have masses @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast , baryons are rather nontrivial . to form a color singlet , they have @xmath0 quarks . assuming that each quark has an energy of order @xmath23 , the mass of a baryon @xmath24 @xcite . for instance",
    ", a gluon exchanged between any two quarks contributes @xmath25 , and contributes to an average hartree potential .",
    "care must be taken with diagrams to higher order : one includes diagrams which modify the average potential , but not iterations thereof .",
    "thus two gluons exchanged between two different pairs of quarks is @xmath2 , but represents an iteration of the average potential .",
    "a diagram which modifies the average potential is given by three quarks which emit three gluons , and which then interact through a three gluon coupling , fig .",
    "( 41 ) of @xcite ; this is @xmath26 .",
    "the scattering of two baryons begins with the exchange of two quarks between the baryons , with a gluon emitted between them , fig .",
    "( 35 ) of @xcite .",
    "since each quark can have a different color , this diagram is @xmath25 .",
    "it is also possible to exchange quarks of the same color without gluon emission ; this is also @xmath7 , fig .",
    "( 36 ) of @xcite . as for the average potential in one baryon ,",
    "the two body scattering amplitude remains @xmath7 to higher order in @xmath27 .",
    "to see this , it is necessary to pick out contributions which are two baryon irreducible , from those which represent iterations of the two baryon potential .",
    "continuing , the scattering between three baryons is @xmath7 : if a quark in each baryon emits a single gluon , which interact through a three gluon interaction , the amplitude is @xmath26 .",
    "again , multiple gluon exchange does not produce higher powers of @xmath0 , once one picks out interactions which are three baryon irreducible .    in general ,",
    "the scattering of @xmath28 baryons is of order @xmath7 .",
    "thus unlike mesons or glueballs , whose interactions vanish at infinite @xmath0 , baryons interact strongly , with couplings of strength @xmath7 .",
    "of course baryon interactions can also be viewed as arising from the exchange of color singlet mesons .",
    "the coupling between a meson and a baryon @xmath29 , and so single meson exchange gives a two baryon interaction @xmath7 , as above .",
    "while it appears that multiple meson exchange will lead to higher powers of @xmath0 , this does not occur , due to an an extended @xmath30 symmetry @xcite .",
    "these cancellations are subtle , and surely have analogies in nuclear matter . for our purposes , however , all we require is that the scattering of @xmath28 baryons is always of order @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath31 symmetry implies the low energy spectrum of baryons is highly degenerate .",
    "the lowest mass baryons form multiplets of isospin , @xmath32 , and spin , @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "these multiplets have @xmath34 , from @xmath35 to @xmath36 for odd @xmath0 .",
    "( for qcd , there is one such state , the @xmath37 . )",
    "the splitting in energy between the states in these multiplets is of order @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a constant .",
    "these are the lightest states : there are other excited baryons with masses @xmath22 above the lightest .    at zero temperature",
    ", there is no fermi sea until the chemical potential exceeds the mass of the fermion .",
    "let @xmath40 be the mass of the lightest baryon , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "it is natural to define a `` constituent '' quark mass , @xmath42 which is of order one at large @xmath0 .",
    "thus at @xmath43 , there is no fermi sea until the baryon chemical potential @xmath44 ; for the quark chemical potential , this is @xmath45 .    to illustrate how quarks enter at large @xmath0 , consider the gluon self energy at nonzero @xmath9 and @xmath5 .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath27 , at zero momentum this is gauge independent , equal to the square of the debye mass . for @xmath12 massless flavors ,",
    "its trace equals @xmath46 taking @xmath8 , holding @xmath19 fixed , we see that the gluon contribution , @xmath47 , survives .",
    "this is the first in an infinite series of planar , gluon diagrams at infinite @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , whether for @xmath15 and @xmath48 , the quark contribution is only @xmath49 , and so suppressed by @xmath21 .",
    "this is true order by order in perturbation theory , both in vacuum and for all @xmath9 and @xmath3 : holding @xmath12 fixed as @xmath8 , the effects of quarks loops are suppressed by @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this is simply because there are @xmath2 gluons in the adjoint representation , but only @xmath7 quarks in the fundamental representation .",
    "since the quark contribution , relative to that of gluons , is @xmath50 , it is essential to hold @xmath12 fixed as @xmath8 ; _ i.e. _ , to take of limit of large @xmath0 , but small @xmath12 .    in this limit",
    ", we can immediately make some broad conclusions about the phase diagram in the @xmath51 plane . at @xmath14 ,",
    "one expects that the deconfining transition temperature @xmath52 @xcite , which appears to be confirmed by numerical simulations on the lattice @xcite . since quarks do nt affect the gluons , the deconfining transition temperature is then _ independent _ of @xmath5 , @xmath53 for values of @xmath3 .",

    "one expects some population of fermions in the thermal ensemble . at large @xmath0",
    ", however , the baryons all have a mass @xmath7 ; thus if @xmath55 , as long as @xmath6 , the relative abundance of baryons is @xmath56 , with @xmath39 a number of order one , and so the baryon abundance is exponentially small at large @xmath0 .",
    "( there is a small window in which baryons can be excited , when @xmath57 , where it costs @xmath1 , and not @xmath7 , to excite baryons . )",
    "this box , @xmath6 and @xmath55 , is the usual , confined phase of hadrons . at nonzero temperature , the pressure @xmath1 is due exclusively to mesons and glueballs , with only exponentially small contributions from baryons . even for @xmath45 ,",
    "the only baryons are those in the fermi sea , or excitations thereof .",
    "simply because they are too heavy , virtual baryon anti - baryon pairs never contribute at large @xmath0 .",
    "this is not true if @xmath5 grows like a power of @xmath0 , but we generally do not consider this regime , except following eq .",
    "( [ pressure_tmu ] ) .",
    "henceforth we concentrate on cool , dense quarks : remaining in the confined phase , @xmath6 , and moving out in @xmath5 from @xmath58 .",
    "this is the `` quarkyonic '' phase in fig .",
    "( [ phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "we explain this terminology later , but stress that as it occurs for @xmath6 ( and @xmath3 ) , that it _ is _ confined .",
    "we note that cleymans and redlich showed that in qcd , phenomenologically the boundary for chemical equilibriation begins at @xmath59  mev when @xmath43 @xcite , reminiscent of fig .",
    "( [ phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "we start by working at zero temperature , very close to the point where a fermi sea of baryons forms .",
    "the fermi momentum for baryons , @xmath60 , is @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath60 is ( arbitrarily ) small , we have an ideal gas of baryons .",
    "for such a gas , the baryon density is @xmath62 , the energy is @xmath63 , and the pressure is @xmath64 for such a dilute gas of baryons , the pressure at @xmath65 is very small , @xmath21 .",
    "now consider increasing @xmath60 further , so that the additional resonances of the baryon condense .",
    "there are several effects which enter .",
    "the first is to include the resonances with @xmath34 , representing the generalization of the @xmath37 , _ etc .",
    "_ , at large @xmath0 .",
    "each species contributes to the pressure as @xmath66 .",
    "summing over spin and isospin gives a total contribution of order @xmath67 thus while the sum over resonances changes the dependence upon @xmath60 , it still contributes to the pressure @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast , once the nucleon fermi momentum increases , the effect of interactions quickly dominates .",
    "the amplitude for the four point interaction between baryons includes a term @xmath68 .",
    "the coupling for this interaction has dimensions of inverse mass squared , which we assume is typical of @xmath23 . at low densities",
    "this interaction contributes of order density squared , or @xmath69 likewise , six point nucleon interactions contribute as density cubed , or @xmath70 , _ etc .",
    "_    now clearly one can not trust this series when the nucleon fermi momentum is of order @xmath23 .",
    "what is interesting is when the series breaks down .",
    "consider balancing ( [ ideal ] ) and ( [ int ] ) : the two terms are comparable when @xmath71 , or @xmath72 thus at _ very _ low nucleon fermi momentum , @xmath73 , two body nucleon interactions are as important as the kinetic terms .",
    "contributions from resonances , ( [ resonances ] ) , are suppressed by one factor of the density , @xmath74 , as are three body interactions .    as @xmath60 increases beyond this point , contributions from the fermi sea , even including the increasing number of states ,",
    "are irrelevant . instead , when @xmath75 , the pressure is completely dominated by baryon _",
    "interactions_. since the interactions between @xmath28 baryons are @xmath7 , all baryon interactions contribute equally , to give a dense phase in which the pressure is @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to stress that at large @xmath0 , the window in which baryons are dilute is _ very _ narrow .",
    "we expect to enter a dense phase , with pressure @xmath7 , when the baryon fermi momentum @xmath76 . in terms of the quark chemical potential ,",
    "though , @xmath77 that is , for @xmath5 one enters a dense regime within @xmath78 of the mass threshold .",
    "this is why in fig .",
    "( [ phase_diagram ] ) , we have indicated that the quarkyonic phase begins right at @xmath58 : the window in which one has dilute baryons is only @xmath16 in width .",
    "this discussion is somewhat naive .",
    "if the potential between two nucleons is attractive at large @xmath0  as it is in qcd  then at arbitrarily low densities free nucleons collapse to form bound nuclear matter .",
    "( this is analogous of the tendency of nuclear matter in qcd to go to the most stable state , which is one of iron nuclei . )",
    "the mass threshold for baryons is then not at @xmath79 , but at @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the binding energy of nuclear matter at large @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "one expects @xmath82 , with @xmath83 . then in fig .",
    "( [ phase_diagram ] ) , the quarkyonic phase begins not at @xmath58 , but within @xmath16 of @xmath84 .    in qcd ,",
    "the nuclear binding energy is anomalously small , @xmath85  mev , versus @xmath86  mev .",
    "we do not know if @xmath87 is generically small in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "if so , it is surely related to the @xmath30 symmetry @xcite . in qcd , however , this may be an `` accident '' of @xmath88 light flavors .    in qcd",
    ", a gas of nucleons does nt directly collapse to nuclear matter , but instead exhibits a liquid - gas transition .",
    "this is because of two effects , the kinetic energy of individual nucleons and coulomb repulsion .",
    "neither is important at large @xmath0 .",
    "as seen above , effects of kinetic energy are automatically @xmath21 .",
    "likewise , taking the baryon electric charge to be of order one at large @xmath0 ( as is necessary for electromagnetism to remain weakly coupled ) , then coulomb repulsion is @xmath1 , and negligible relative to the nuclear potential , @xmath7 .",
    "in the previous section we saw that when the nucleon fermi momentum @xmath75 , that one goes into a dense phase , dominated by baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "to understand what might happen in this regime , in this section we review the properties of skyrme crystals @xcite .",
    "our principal interest is as an example of a confined theory which nevertheless has a chirally symmetric phase .",
    "the usual skyrme model is a sum of two terms , @xmath89 ^ 2 \\ ; \\;\\ ; , \\;\\;\\ ; v_\\mu = u^\\dagger \\partial_\\mu u \\ ; \\;\\ ; , \\;\\;\\ ; u = \\exp(i",

    "we limit ourselves here to the skyrme model for two flavors , where @xmath92 is the pion field .",
    "there are many other terms besides those in ( [ skyrme_action ] ) ; terms from the anomaly contribute through the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) lagrangian .",
    "the two terms above must be viewed as the leading terms in a derivative expansion .",
    "terms with higher numbers of derivatives have coupling constants with dimensions of inverse mass squared .",
    "the mass dimension of these other terms is presumably set by ( inverse ) powers of @xmath23 .",
    "a single skyrmion is given by a solution to the field equations from ( [ skyrme_action ] ) over all of space - time .",
    "since the terms in the action are @xmath7 , the energy of a configuration is also of the same order , and represents a single baryon .",
    "as shown by klebanov @xcite , a realistic crystal is given by considering periodic solutions in a finite box .",
    "like the energy of a single baryon , the energy of the skymrion crystal is automatically @xmath7 , with one baryon per box . solving the skyrme equations of motion for a system with cubic symmetry",
    "is technically involved . for many crystals",
    ", however , it is known that a reasonable approximation is to chop off the corners of the cube , and to consider the theory on a sphere .",
    "this approximation was adopted by kutschera , pethick , and ravenhall , and also by manton @xcite .",
    "many properties of the crystal with cubic symmetry are especially transparent for a spherical geometry .",
    "if @xmath93 is the size of the sphere , the solution is constructed so that there is one baryon per sphere , so the baryon density is @xmath94 .",
    "a crystal is a bad approximation for large @xmath93 , but presumably reasonable when @xmath95 . at large @xmath0 , this mass scale @xmath1 .    for large spheres ,",
    "the chiral symmetry is broken , as the @xmath96 field points in a given direction in isospin space ; typically , @xmath97 at spatial infinity .",
    "as @xmath93 decreases , the stationary point is distorted by the finite volume of the sphere .    as the radius of the sphere becomes small",
    ", there is a phase transition to a chirally symmetric phase . for small spheres ,",
    "the stationary point is just the identity map , from from @xmath98 of the @xmath96 s to @xmath98 of space , taking @xmath99 .",
    "this has unit baryon number per spherical volume , but it is also easy to see that the integral of @xmath96 , over the sphere , vanishes .",
    "the restoration of chiral symmetry is less obvious for a crystal with cubic symmetry .",
    "it follows from the half - skyrmion symmetry of goldhaber and manton , where the total chiral order parameter cancels between different regions of the crystal @xcite .",
    "( for more than two flavors , the correct representation of the chirally symmetric phase is presumably a generalization of this half - skyrmion symmetry . )",
    "the crucial test for the restoration of chiral symmetry is that the excitation modes fall into chiral multiplets of the unbroken symmetry .",
    "this was shown for the mesonic excitations of the crystal by forkel _",
    "since the baryon current is topological , the baryon excitations are not evident . in a chirally symmetric phase",
    ", they must be parity doubled . in detail",
    ", this happens because the baryon is a topological current .",
    "thus it is given by integrating over the entire box ; if the configuration is chirally symmetric , so are the integrals thereof",
    ".    the skyrme crystal does not give one insight into all properties of the system .",
    "the pressure of the system is not obvious , nor even the chemical potential of baryons .",
    "what one can do is to compute how the energy , per cell , depends upon the density . _",
    "if _ one takes only the two terms in the skyrme lagrangian of ( [ skyrme_action ] ) , then the term with four derivatives dominates at small @xmath93 , which is high density .",
    "since this term is scale invariant , one automatically finds that the relationship between the energy density , @xmath100 , and the density , @xmath101 , is that for a conformally symmetric theory , @xmath102 , controlled by the coupling @xmath39 .",
    "this is an accident of keeping only two terms in the skyrme lagrangian .",
    "terms with six derivatives , for example , are also proportional to @xmath0 , with dimensions of @xmath103 .",
    "when the size of the crystal is @xmath104 , however , _ all _ such interactions are equally important .",
    "this is analogous to the counting for baryon baryon interactions , which are always @xmath7 , and which are characterized by mass scales @xmath22 .",
    "we stress that the skyrme crystal is only meant as an illustration . for example , while naively one expects that a system of heavy particles forms a crystal , since the interactions are as large , also @xmath7 , even this may not necessarily follow .",
    "skyrme crystals illustrate what might happen as @xmath5 increases from @xmath58 ( or @xmath105 from @xmath40 ) .",
    "alternately , one can consider working down in @xmath5 .",
    "for very large @xmath5 , @xmath106 , one should be able to compute the total pressure by perturbation theory , in the qcd coupling @xmath27 : @xmath107 the function @xmath108 has been computed to @xmath109 @xcite . at large @xmath0 , it is given by planar diagrams with a single quark line , and an arbitrary number of gluon insertions .",
    "the pressure of ideal ( massless ) quarks is @xmath110 .",

    "it , and the remaining hole in the fermi sea , then scatter off of other quarks in the fermi sea , knocking some out , creating other holes , and so on .",
    "eventually , one ends up with not a single , unconfined quark , but a perturbed fermi sea , characterized by some number of excited _ baryons _ and their holes . that the theory confines is clearer if the external probe carries momentum @xmath22 : then one immediately sees that the only particles ( and holes ) excited near the fermi surafce are not quarks , but baryons .",
    "the above discussion applies to quarks of any mass , and leads to the phase diagram of fig .",
    "( [ phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "an example is provided by the solution of qcd in @xmath123 dimensions @xcite . in two dimensions",
    "there is only a confined phase , @xmath124 .",
    "schon and thies showed that at nonzero quark density , the quark propagator remains infrared divergent , and so confined , as it is in vacuum @xcite .",
    "this is exactly what one expects of a quarkyonic phase : that only color singlet excitations , such as mesons and baryons , have finite energy",
    ". it would be interesting to perform more detailed calculations , such as of the free energy , and how the properties of mesons and baryons change with @xmath5 .",
    "returning to four dimensions , the crucial question is : where is the chiral phase transition for light quarks ? for @xmath55 , it surely coincides with the deconfining phase transition , and occurs at @xmath4 .",
    "we suggest , however , that the two transitions no longer coincide when @xmath45 .",
    "if we take the skyrme crystal as a guide to the quarkyonic phase , then chiral symmetry restoration occurs not at the mass threshold , but above @xmath125 .",
    "this is because there must be some significant density of baryons in the fermi sea to drive the transition .",
    "further , the transition occurs when @xmath126 , on the order of the constituent quark mass , and not at some @xmath5 which is asymptotically large in a power of @xmath0 .",
    "schematically , this gives the blue line in fig .",
    "( [ phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "this can also be seen in illustrative models . as an example of a possible solution to the schwinger - dyson equations @xcite , wagenbrunn and glozman @xcite studied a model with a confining gluon propagator , @xmath127 in momentum space . at infinite @xmath0 ,",
    "solutions to the schwinger - dyson equations are those where the quark propagator ( and its vertex with gluons ) change , but the gluon propagator does nt . computing with the quark propagator at @xmath48 , but leaving the gluon propagator unchanged , it is not difficult to see that increasing @xmath5 drives chiral symmetry restoration at some nonzero value of @xmath5 above the mass threshold .",
    "this can also be seen from the eigenvalue distribution of the dirac operator . in vacuum",
    ", banks and casher showed that chiral symmetry breaking is driven by a nonzero density eigenvalues at zero eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "when @xmath48 , for @xmath128 the eigenvalues spread out in the complex plane , and there is no simple analogous condition @xcite .",
    "even so , it is most natural then as @xmath5 increases above the mass threshold , that whatever effect the gauge fields have on the eigenvalues , that eventually it is overwhelmed by @xmath48 .",
    "an explicit example of this is chiral symmetry restoration in random matrix models @xcite .",
    "the splitting of the deconfining and chiral transitions can be represented naturally in effective models .",
    "mocsy , sannino , and tuominen @xcite showed that if the coupling between the polyakov loop and the chiral condensate has one sign , the transitions coincide ; for the other , they diverge .",
    "thus this coupling vanishes at the point where the transitions diverge .    at large @xmath0 , because of the changes in the magnitude of the pressure",
    ", the deconfining transition is expected to be of first order .",
    "once the chiral transition no longer coincides with deconfinement , its order is presumably controlled by the usual renormalization group analysis @xcite , and depends strongly upon the number of flavors .",
    "there is one caveat which must be noted .",
    "chiral symmetry , and its possible restoration , can be sensitive to pairing near the fermi surface .",
    "certainly for @xmath106 , one expects that quarks deep in the fermi sea are best described as chirally symmetric .",
    "it is possible , however , that the baryons near the fermi surface may experience non - perturbative effects which cause them to pair in a chirally asymmetric manner .",
    "this effect will manifestly be small , suppressed at least by @xmath121 .    up to this point , we have assumed that @xmath3 , so that gluons are blind to quarks and their fermi sea . especially to understand finite @xmath0 , however , it is also necessary to consider values of @xmath5 which grow with ( fractional ) powers of @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the temperature @xmath129 , like @xmath130 , the temperature for deconfinement at @xmath14 . in perturbation theory ,",
    "the pressure includes terms as @xmath131 in the limit of large @xmath0 , @xmath108 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 are functions of the coupling constant @xmath27 and @xmath12 . the coupling runs with both mass scales , @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "thus when @xmath5 grows like a power of @xmath0 times @xmath23 , perturbation theory in @xmath27 is a good approximation . as always ,",
    "this is excepting power like corrections from the region near the fermi surface .",
    "consider @xmath134 . in this region ,",
    "the quark contribution to the pressure , @xmath135 , is as large as that of deconfined gluons , @xmath136 . in this regime ,",
    "the quark contribution to the pressure is independent of temperature , since @xmath137 is down by @xmath20 .",
    "it is possible that there is a temperature dependent term in the pressure , induced by baryons near the fermi surface ; _ e.g. _ , @xmath138 , which is down by @xmath21 to the leading term , @xmath2 .    at larger values of @xmath139 , quarks contribute to the debye mass in the limit of large @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ debye ] ) . in this regime , the pressure is completely dominated by that of quarks at zero temperature , @xmath140 . in perturbation theory ,",
    "the gluon contribution to the pressure remains @xmath141 , with the temperature dependent part of the quark pressure also @xmath142 ; thus both are down by @xmath143 , relative to the quark term at zero temperature .    when @xmath139 , gluons are screened by quarks , and one is in a qualitatively new regime . at zero temperature ,",
    "the wilson loop no longer exhibits an area law ; at nonzero temperature , the renormalized polyakov loop acquires an expectation value of order one .",
    "consequently , eventually the first order phase transition for deconfinement ends .",
    "it can do so in one of two ways : the phase boundary for deconfinement can either bend over to zero temperature , or it can end in a critical end point at @xmath15 . our simple arguments can not predict which occurs .",
    "it is reasonable that either is only possible once gluons feel the quarks ; _ i.e. _ , when @xmath139 .",
    "if so , and there is a critical end point , the critical behavior is a correction in @xmath143 to the total pressure , which is dominated by the zero temperature term for quarks .",
    "we remark that if @xmath12 goes to infinity with @xmath0 , then all terms in eq .",
    "( [ pressure_tmu ] ) are @xmath2 . indeed , when both @xmath0 and @xmath12 are large , then even in vacuum one can not speak , rigorously , of confinement .",
    "we have no insight into this limit .",
    "deryagin , grigoriev , and rubakov showed that at large @xmath0 , the color singlet pairing of chiral density waves dominates over the di - quark pairing of color superconductivity @xcite .",
    "their perturbative analysis is reliable for @xmath106 , as long as the quarks do not lie within @xmath22 of the fermi surface .",
    "when they do , the pairing of baryons also contributes .",
    "son and shuster @xcite showed that even for extremely large values of @xmath0 , debye screening disfavors the pairing to chiral density waves , and quark color superconductivity dominates . in sec .",
    "( [ quarkqcd ] ) , we adopt a similar criterion to estimate when in qcd there is a transition from a quarkyonic , to a perturbative , regime .",
    "at zero temperature and density , the effect of anomalies usually ensures that any confined phase is one in which chiral symmetry is broken .",
    "we now give a heuristic argument as to why this need not be true at nonzero density .",
    "casher , and then casher and banks , argued that in the vacuum , confinement automatically implies the breaking of chiral symmetry @xcite . consider a meson , in which the quark propagates to the right , with a spin along its direction of motion . to remain a meson at rest",
    ", this must mix with a quark propagating to the left , which can happen by scattering off of a gluon .",
    "its spin , however , is now opposite to the direction of motion , so its helicity has been flipped .",
    "since in qcd the interactions preserve chirality , which for a massless field equals helicity , this change of direction can not occur .",
    "it can if there is a mass condensate in the vacuum , which the quark can scatter off of , and flip its helicity .",
    "note that this argument is especially tight in the limit of large @xmath0 , where the number of quarks in a meson is fixed .",
    "now consider the similar process at nonzero temperature .",
    "then besides scattering off of a gluon , one can scatter of a quark in a thermal distribution .",
    "however , if we consider the processes of both emission and adsorption , the total is @xmath144 ; @xmath145 is the energy of the rightgoing quark , is @xmath146 is the energy of the leftgoing quark , and @xmath147 is the fermi - dirac statistical distribution function .    for an isotropic distribution , as in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "if the momenta are the same , then the two distribution functions cancel .",
    "thus the process is only allowed when @xmath148 .",
    "since the momenta of the right and left moving quarks are different , however , we end up with an excited meson , different from the initial meson .",
    "that is , this process represents not a meson at rest , but scattering between a meson , and some thermally excited state , such as another meson .",
    "in general , this is fine in a thermal distribution : what we mean by a `` meson '' is a sum over states anyway .",
    "however , there is a problem at large @xmath0 : if @xmath15 and @xmath14 , then all interactions vanish at large @xmath0 , and this process must be suppressed by powers of @xmath143 .",
    "thus casher s argument suggests that at nonzero temperature , and @xmath14 , the connection between chiral symmetry and confinement remains .",
    "this connection could be lost in the presence of a fermi sea , however .",
    "the argument goes through as before , except now we scatter off of a quark in the fermi sea .",
    "physically , the quark in the test meson scatters off a quark in a baryon , which then scatters into a baryon hole .",
    "there is no inconsistency with the large @xmath0 expansion , because the scattering amplitude is large , of order one .",
    "this suggests that it is possible to have a confined , but chirally symmetric , phase at @xmath48 .",
    "what of the constraints from anomalies , which after all , are due to ultraviolet effects ? certainly the anomaly itself is unchanged by temperature or density .",
    "their implications are less obvious when @xmath9 or @xmath5 are nonzero . because of the breaking of lorentz invariance at @xmath9 and @xmath48 , itoyama and mueller showed that many more amplitudes arise @xcite .",
    "the anomaly relates these amplitudes , but not as directly as in vacuum .",
    "for example , pisarski , trueman , and tytgat showed that the sutherland - veltman theorem , which relates the amplitudes for @xmath149 , does not apply at nonzero temperature @xcite .",
    "thus the connection between chiral symmetry breaking , and confinement , need not remain at nonzero @xmath9 or @xmath5 .",
    "the above generalization of casher s argument suggests that a system at @xmath48 is uniquely different from @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this may arise as follows .",
    "anomalies are saturated by excitations with arbitrarily low energies ; for example , when chiral symmetry breaking occurs , by pions . to model a chirally symmetric phase , consider massive , parity doubled baryons @xcite . in a thermal distribution with @xmath14 , massive modes",
