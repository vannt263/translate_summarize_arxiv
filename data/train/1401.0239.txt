    "proxima centauri ( @xmath5  centauri  c , v645  cen , gj  551 ; parallax @xmath6  mas ) is the nearest known star , lying 1.30  pc from the sun .",
    "it is located at a projected angular separation of @xmath7 and a linear distance of 0.07  pc ( 14,500  au ) from the bright and slightly more distant binary @xmath5  cen a+b .",
    "the distance , proper motion , and radial velocity of proxima are closely similar to those of @xmath5  cen a+b , showing that the system forms a wide triple ( wertheimer et al .",
    "2006 ) ; however , proxima s large separation from @xmath5  cen a+b means that it has evolved effectively as a single star .",
    "proxima is a low - mass , m5  ve dwarf and flare star , with an apparent magnitude of @xmath8 , a radial velocity of @xmath9 ( torres et al .",
    "2006 ) , and a proper motion of @xmath10 in position angle ( pa ) @xmath11 , as measured by ( van  leeuwen 2007 ; also see benedict et al .",
    "1999 , evidently measuring it from north through west instead of the conventional direction . ] )      proxima , as an m dwarf , represents the most common type of star .",
    "proxima s radius is known from vlti ( very large telescope interferometry ) observations to be @xmath12 ( sgransan et al .",
    "but , as an effectively isolated star , proxima s mass can only be estimated from mass - luminosity ( m - l ) relations as @xmath2@xmath13 .",
    "a star s mass is its most important physical parameter , being the primary determinant of its temperature , radius , luminosity , lifetime , and ultimate fate .",
    "the only directly measured stellar masses come from double - lined eclipsing systems and visual binaries . for dm stars like proxima",
    ", the observational situation is particularly poor , with less than a dozen double - lined eclipsing systems known that have primary masses of @xmath14@xmath15 ( e.g. , kraus et al.2011 ) .",
    "moreover , the eclipsing systems are not representative of field dm stars , because synchronous rotation causes stellar activity , starspots , and inflated radii .",
    "the masses of single low - mass stars have to be inferred largely from theoretical m - l relations , which suffer from poorly understood opacities and interior structure ( e.g. , chabrier & baraffe 1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "ground - based radial - velocity ( rv ) measurements have recently led to discovery of a @xmath16 planet orbiting @xmath5  cen  b at a distance of 0.04  au ( dumusque et al .",
    "however , all attempts to detect planets around proxima centauri have so far been unsuccessful .",
    "m dwarfs are generally not optimal for search for planets though rv techniques , since a large fraction of them have surface activity , which increases rv jitter ( e.g. , campbell et al .  1991 ; wright 2005 ) .",
    "however , proxima itself has a relatively small rv scatter of 3.1  ms@xmath17 , and rv techniques have been used extensively to search for planets around it .",
    "these data exclude the presence of any planet in a circular orbit with @xmath18 at orbital separations of @xmath19 au ( endl & krster 2008 ) .",
    "however , this does not rule out the presence of larger planets whose orbital plane may be close to face - on .",
    "no planetary transits have been reported for proxima .",
    "astrometric techniques have also been unsuccessful in detecting any planets around proxima , which excludes the presence of any planet with mass @xmath4@xmath20 in the period range 1 day @xmath21 days , corresponding to orbital separations of 0.01 to 1 au ( benedict et al .",
    "in this paper we discuss an alternative method for measuring masses of nearby single stars and for searching for planetary companions , and an upcoming opportunity to apply this method to proxima centauri .",
    "the special importance of microlensing events produced by very nearby stars was emphasized by paczyski ( 1996 ) . for such events the",
    "term `` mesolensing '' has been suggested ( di  stefano 2008 ) , because the large angular einstein radii of nearby stars , coupled with their typically large proper motions , yield relatively large probabilities of such events occurring .",
    "searches for upcoming close stellar passages of high - proper - motion stars near background sources have been carried out by salim & gould ( 2000 ) and proft , demleitner , & wambsganss ( 2011 ) , who have published lists of candidate events ( see also lpine and di  stefano 2012 , who discuss a specific event ) .    in the case of microlensing events due to",
    "nearby stars , the foreground star will almost always be much brighter than the background source , making it difficult to measure its astrometric shift of the fainter background star .",
    "the contamination from the foreground star reduces when the lens - source separation is larger , but then the astrometric signal also reduces , making the measurement again difficult . measuring",
    "the astrometric signal will be easiest if we can find a situation where the centroid shift is large even when the lens  source angular separation is large .",
    "such a situation arises for the very nearest stars , for which the angular einstein radii are the largest .    to search for such very favorable events , we started with the luyten half second ( lhs ) catalog ( luyten 1979 ) , a compilation of all known stars with proper motions greater than @xmath22 .",
    "the coordinates in the lhs catalog are only approximate , so we used improved positions and proper motions determined by lpine & shara ( 2005 ) ( mostly for northern - hemisphere stars ) , and the revised positions and proper motions published by bakos , sahu , & nemeth ( 2002 ) for the remainder . unlike the previous studies , we took the parallaxes of the lhs stars into account , if they are available in the simbad database , since parallax significantly alters the circumstances of the events for very nearby stars .",
    "we then projected the positions of all @xmath25,000 lhs stars forward over the next 40  years and searched for close passages ( impact parameter @xmath14@xmath23 ) near background stars contained in the gsc  2.3 catalog ( lasker et al .",
    "of the events that we have found will occur in the next few years , one of the most interesting is the close passage of proxima centauri in front of a pair of background source stars of @xmath24 magnitudes 20 and 19.5 , separated by @xmath25 .",
    "closest approaches will occur in 2014 and 2016 , respectively .",
    "figure  1 shows images of the proxima field from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) ir and 2mass ( cutri et al .",
    "2003 ) surveys , taken in 1997 and 2000 , respectively .",
    "proxima is the bright star to the left , marked with a blue circle , and moving rapidly to the right ( west - northwest ) .",
    "a second green circle marks the pair of background stars .",
    "although it might appear from a cursory inspection of the ground - based images in figure  1 that close passages must occur frequently , passages as close as @xmath2@xmath26 are actually rare .",
    "moreover , proxima is exceptional in having an einstein ring radius as large as 28  mas , because it is so close to the earth . for more typical proper - motion stars at considerably larger distances than proxima , only extremely close passages ( @xmath14@xmath27 )",
    "are of interest from a microlensing standpoint  and they would generally suffer considerably from large differences in brightnesses .    to refine the impact parameters and times of closest approach",
    ", we obtained _ hubble space telescope _ ( ) images of the field on 2012 october  1 .",
    "observations were taken with the uvis channel of the wide field camera  3 ( wfc3 ) in the f475w , f555w , f606w , and f814w filters .",
    "since the background stars are @xmath48  mag fainter than proxima , we obtained two sets of observations , a short one with an exposure time of 0.5  s ( the minimum allowed exposure time with wfc3 ) in each filter , and a long one with an exposure time of 100 to 200  s. an extra set of short and long exposures were obtained in the f555w filter , which were dithered by about @xmath28 with respect to the first set .",
    "the two long exposures obtained in the f555w filter were used to produce a cosmic - ray cleaned image of the field . since proxima is heavily saturated in the longer exposures , care was taken to choose a telescope orientation such that neither the diffraction spikes nor the charge bleeding from proxima would affect the background sources .",
    "proxima was not saturated in the short exposures in f475w an f555w filters , but was slightly ( @xmath2930% ) saturated in the f606w and f814w filters .",
    "the short exposures were used for photometry of proxima itself , and the long exposures were used for photometry of the background stars . even though we have used a large aperture to take the charge bleeding into account in our photometry in the saturated images ( gilliland 1994 ) in the f814w and f606w filters , the photometric uncertainties in these filters are expected to be higher .",
    "the photometric magnitudes for proxima ( on the vega - mag system ) and the source stars along with the estimated errors are listed in table  1 .",
    "we also examined the 2mass source catalog for the infrared magnitudes of the sources .",
    "the 2mass catalog shows a single source at this position , with magnitudes of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , and uncertainties of about @xmath330.07  mag .",
    "these magnitudes most likely represent the combined light of both background sources .",
    "figure  2 shows our long - exposure image taken in the f555w ( @xmath24 ) filter .",
    "also shown is the future path of proxima ( green line ) , calculated using the proper motion and parallax ( esa 1997 ) , and taking into account the stellar positions as observed by on 2012 october  1 .",
    "the uncertainty in proxima s path is less than the width of the line during the time interval shown here .",
    "as the figure shows , proxima will actually pass _ between _ the two background stars labeled as  source 1 \" and  source 2 , \" affording two independent opportunities to measure the relativistic light deflection and search for effects of planetary companions .",
    "the closest passages will occur in 2014 october , with an impact parameter of @xmath34 , and in 2016 february , with an impact parameter of @xmath35 .",
    "this prediction is confirmed through a second set of observations that we obtained in 2013 march .",
    "details of the predicted close encounters are given in table  1 .",
    "( we have an approved program to obtain further observations at 10 different epochs during 2014 to 2017 .",
    "the predictions given in table  1 will improve as we obtain further observations , and the improved predictions will be made available at this website : http://www.stsci.edu/@xmath36ksahu .",
    "the exact time of the future observations will be adjusted based on results obtained from previous observations , in order to maximize the scientific return . )",
    "we note from table  1 that the colors of both sources are similar to or bluer than proxima , but they are at least 8.5  mag fainter than proxima .",
    "that would imply that the distances to these source stars are @xmath460 pc , much larger than the distance to proxima . in our current analysis of predicting the closest approaches , we have ignored the parallax and proper motion of the source stars , which are expected to be small .",
    "this can be rectified if our future observations show any parallax or proper motion .",
    "when a background star ( the source ) passes within or close to the einstein ring of a foreground object ( the lens ) , it splits into two images and the combined brightness exceeds that of the source star as depicted in figure  3 . as explained in more detail later , the sources will pass several einstein ring radii from proxima itself , but could pass very close to or within the einstein ring of a planet .",
    "so we provide a general formalism here , which is valid for small as well as large impact parameters .",
    "( for more details , see schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 ; paczyski 1996 ; and dominik & sahu 2000 ) .",
    "the angular radius of the einstein ring of a point lens can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the lens mass and @xmath39 is the parallax distance of the lens as measured with respect to the more distant source , given by @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 being the distances from the earth to the lens and the source , respectively .",
    "if the angular separation between the lens and the ( undeflected ) source is @xmath43 , then the two images of the source will be located at separations of @xmath44 \\theta_\\mathrm{e}\\ ] ] relative to the position of the lens , and @xmath45 note that the source , the lens , and the two images of the source all lie on a straight line ; the positive sign implies the same side as the source from the lens , and the negative sign implies the opposite side .",
    "the angular distances of the two images from the original position of the source are given by @xmath46 .",
    "figure 3 schematically shows images as the source ( shown by the red dots ) passes though the einstein ring ( blue circle ) of the lens .",
    "the two images are shown in black , one outside the einstein ring ( major image ) , and the other inside ( minor image ) .",

    "note that @xmath56 increases with @xmath55 when @xmath57 , after which it decreases with @xmath55 .",
    "as the figure shows , when @xmath58 ( as in the case of proxima ) , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , so that the position of the major image can be taken as the centroid of the combined image , and its amplification as the amplification of the combined image .    for @xmath58",
    ", the centroid shift can now be written as @xmath61    adopting a distance of 1.3  pc and a mass of @xmath13 for proxima , and assuming @xmath62 in eqn .  1",
    ", we find that its einstein ring radius is @xmath63  mas.thus a background source lying at an angular distance @xmath43 from proxima will have its apparent position shifted by @xmath64    using eqns .  1 and 11",
    ", we can express the mass of the lens as @xmath65    the angular separation @xmath43 , and the centroid shift @xmath66 can be determined from the observations taken before and during the event . to measure the mass of the lens using eqn .",
    "13 , the remaining required parameter is the parallax distance @xmath39 , depending only on the _ difference _ between the parallaxes of the lens and the source .",
    "the parallax of the lens is already known , and our planned observations will directly constrain the source parallaxes ( expected to be very small as noted above ) .    for the upcoming close encounters of proxima centauri , the sources lie on either side , with impact parameters of 0.5 and 1.6 arcsec , which correspond to @xmath67 and 57 , respectively . for such large @xmath55 , the major image will lie within @xmath21.5  mas of the undeflected source location .",
    "the brightness of the minor image , which will lie within @xmath21  mas of proxima itself , will be @xmath14@xmath68 that of the primary image , and thus can be ignored .    in figures  5 and 6 we plot the centroid shifts of sources  1 and  2 as functions of time , under the assumption that proxima has a mass of @xmath13 .",
    "the maximum centroid shift for source  1 is @xmath20.5  mas at closest approach , and for source  2 it is @xmath21.5  mas . as seen from eqn .  12 , the centroid shift scales inversely with the angular separation between proxima and the source star , so the deflections are already underway as we write ! assuming that the centroid shifts of the two sources can be measured with an accuracy of 200 mas per epoch",
    ", proxima s mass can be measured with an accuracy of @xmath25% .",
    "if proxima has planetary companions , it may be possible to detect them  and measure their masses  through their extra astrometric shifts of one or both of the background stars ( safizadeh , dalal , & griest 1999 ; han & lee 2002 ) .",
    "using eqn .  1",
    ", we can write the size of the angular einstein ring due to a planet around proxima as @xmath69 the maximum possible extra deflection due to a jupiter - mass planet is @xmath70  mas , which would occur when the angular separation between the background source s deflected image and the planet is @xmath71  mas .",
    "figure  6 shows an example of how the gravitational deflection of source  2 might be modified by the presence of a planetary companion of proxima under favorable circumstances .",
    "we have assumed a jupiter - mass companion in a face - on circular orbit with a separation of 0.8  au , which has a closest approach of 14  mas from the background star .",
    "the dashed lines in both panels show the deflections when this hypothetical planet is included in the calculations .",
    "the effect of the motion of the planet in its 751-day orbit is included .",
    "as the figure illustrates , such a planet would produce a relatively large distortion of the deflection curve by about 0.5  mas , but lasting only about 3  days .",
    "let us now calculate the sizes of the regions around proxima in which planets can be detected through their astrometric signals . if the minimum astrometric deflection that can be measured is @xmath72 , then the corresponding maximum angular distance between the source and the planet can be written , using eqn .",
    "9 , as @xmath73 this equation implies , for example , that if @xmath74  mas ( detectable with spatial scanning as discussed above ) , the deflection due to a jupiter - mass planet would be detectable if the planet passes within @xmath23 of either background source .",
    "figure  7 illustrates the spatial regions around proxima in which planets of various masses will be detectable during the upcoming approaches of the two background stars .",
    "here we show the trajectories of the two stars in a proxima - centered reference frame .",
    "dotted curves refer to source  1 , and solid curves to source  2 .",
    "the sets of blue curves surrounding both trajectories , with separations of @xmath2@xmath23 from the stars , enclose the regions in which a jupiter - mass planet is detectable with a deflection exceeding 0.03  mas .",
    "the red curves surrounding the two trajectories enclose the regions in which the deflection due to a @xmath75 planet is detectable .",
    "even though astrometric microlensing provides an exciting possibility of detecting planets around proxima , the probability of such a detection is small for two reasons .",
    "first , the microlensing signal due to a planet lasts only about 2  days .",
    "second , there is a zone close to proxima where it becomes difficult to distinguish the signal due to a planet from that due to proxima itself .",
    "detection of the planetary signal is easier when the planet passes closer to the source star , and is most favorable when the planet passes through a point where its separation from the source is much less than the planet s separation from proxima .",
    "if proxima has a planet which passes within a few mas of either source , photometric signatures of microlensing due to the planet may be detectable . as noted earlier",
    ", the einstein ring of a jupiter - mass planet has a radius of about 8  mas . for a photometric accuracy of 1%",
    ", the planetary signature will be detected for an amplification of @xmath76 , which is achieved if the impact parameter @xmath77 ( eqn .",
    "this requires the planet to lie within an angular distance @xmath78 of the source , where @xmath79 thus any jovian - mass planet that passes within 28  mas of either background star ( corresponding to a linear separation of @xmath800.036  au ) can be detected through precision photometry .",
    "the einstein - ring crossing time is given by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the proper motion of the planet relative to the background star . assuming the proper motion of proxima for the planet , the crossing time is @xmath83 the duration of the photometric event can be written as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the source - lens separation , in units of @xmath86 , at which the amplification is detectable .",
    "an amplification of @xmath76 corresponds to @xmath87 .",
    "thus @xmath88 can be up to 7 times @xmath89 , or , for a jupiter - mass planet , @xmath219  days .    in figure  7 the green lines surrounding each background source trajectory",
    "enclose the regions within which a 1% photometric amplification by a jovian planet would be detectable .",
    "these zones are very small , so the probability of detecting photometric microlensing by a planet is extremely small .",
    "successful observations of these events will be challenging , because the background stars are @xmath908.5  mag fainter than proxima and will require accurate astrometry and photometry at separations from proxima ranging from @xmath91 to @xmath2@xmath23 . here",
    "we discuss the feasibility of the observations from space and from the ground .      for the upcoming events , the minimum values of @xmath43 will be @xmath92 and @xmath93 , corresponding to maximum deflections of 0.5 and 1.5  mas .",
    "such displacements are routinely measured using cameras onboard ; in fact , astrometric accuracies of 0.2  mas have been achieved in single measurements through direct imaging with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and wfc3 ( e.g. , anderson et al .",
    "2006 ; bellini et al .",
    "2011 ) , and spatial - scanning modes have been developed recently with wfc3 that can achieve astrometric accuracies of about 0.03  mas ( a.  riess , private communication ) .",
    "the fact that these observations can be obtained easily with even in the presence of proxima is illustrated in figure  8 . in order to achieve astrometric accuracy of 0.2  mas per observation",
    ", we need a s / n of about 300 for each background star , which can be achieved in an exposure time ( wfc3 , f555w filter ) of 70  s. the left panel shows a 200-s exposure on proxima taken with wfc3 in f555w filter , which is thrice the required exposure time .",

    "the counts drop below 5000  electrons at a radial distance of 12.5  pixels , at which point the background becomes negligible compared to a star with s / n = 300 . since the source star will actually be at a separation of @xmath93 even at closest approach , saturation effects are thus unimportant provided the diffraction spikes and charge bleeding are avoided .",
    "these events will conveniently occur during the operational life time of _ gaia _ , esa s astrometry mission , recently successfully launched .",
    "_ gaia _ can observe down to @xmath94 , and its astrometric accuracy is expected to be 0.1 to 0.3 mas depending on the source magnitude ( gare et al .",

    "<S> moreover , if proxima has a planetary system , the planets may be detectable through their additional microlensing signals , although the probability of such detections is small . with astrometric accuracies of 0.03  mas ( achievable with spatial scanning ) , centroid shifts caused by jovian planets are detectable at separations of up to @xmath3 ( corresponding to 2.6  au at the distance of proxima ) , and centroid shifts by earth - mass planets are detectable within a small band of 8 mas ( corresponding to 0.01  au ) around the source trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> jovian planets within a band of about 28 mas ( corresponding to 0.036 au ) around the source trajectories would produce a brightening of the source by @xmath40.01  mag and could hence be detectable . </S>",
    "<S> estimated timescales of the astrometric and photometric microlensing events due to a planet range from a few hours to a few days , and both methods would provide direct measurements of the planetary mass . </S>"
