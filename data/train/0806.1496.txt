    "<S> we can therefore expect that analyzing the das of @xmath51 will make it possible to determine with good accuracy not only the position , ( which is not very sensitive to the choice of @xmath46 ) , but also the exponent of the critical singularity .    in our analysis of the ht series </S>",

    "<S> [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> its uncertainty accounts also for the spread in the estimate of the critical temperature used to bias the da calculation . </S>",
    "<S> these results are illustrated in fig.[figbetacda2 ] .    in fig.[figsigma ] , we have compared how the estimate of @xmath22 depends on the value @xmath62 used to bias the das , when either the quantity @xmath51 or @xmath39 is analyzed in a vicinity of @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly the results obtained from the analysis of @xmath39 are much more sensitive to the bias value .    </S>",
    "<S> taking advantage of our extension of the ht series , we can also get some hint of the analytic structure of the susceptibility in a vicinity of the origin of the complex @xmath40 plane . </S>",
    "<S> in fig.[figsing ] , we have reported a scatter - plot showing the distribution of the nearby complex singularities for a large class of inhomogeneous first - order das of @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> we have discarded only a few spurious real singularities with modulus less than @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> we can notice that , in addition to the physical singularities at @xmath65 and to many randomly scattered complex singularities , which we believe to represent only numerical noise , there is evidence of five pairs of complex - conjugate singularities , located just beyond the convergence disc of the series . </S>",
    "<S> they are indicated by clusters of da singularities , which are likely to coalesce around tips of cuts with increasing series order . </S>",
    "<S> these results , which do not essentially depend on the value of the constant @xmath46 in @xmath49 , are reminiscent of the regular pattern of the nearby unphysical singularities ( cuts ) which were exactly determined for the _ sq_-lattice two - dimensional @xmath66 @xmath22-model@xcite in the large @xmath67 limit and conjectured@xcite to exist also for finite @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now perform a similar update of the analysis for the _ tr _ lattice series . as shown in fig.[figbetactria ] , an unbiased da study of @xmath39 yields a critical inverse - temperature @xmath2 , sizably improving the precision of our 14th - order estimate @xmath69 reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ ] , but disagreeing with the da estimate @xmath70 obtained in the 15th - order study of ref . [ ] . from an analysis of das of @xmath39 biased with the critical temperature @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we are led to the estimate @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> if , however , in analogy with the _ sq_-lattice analysis , we consider the quantity @xmath49 with @xmath72 , obtained from a fit of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath73 as indicated above , we arrive at the estimate @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also particularly interesting to notice that the pattern of the singularities of @xmath49 in the complex @xmath40-plane is much simpler than that observed in the case of the _ sq _ lattice and consists of a single pair of complex - conjugate clusters , located farther from the border of the convergence disc than in the case of the _ sq _ lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this is an indication that the convergence of the _ tr_-lattice ht series will be faster than in the _ sq _ lattice case , and so the argument that the _ effective lengths _ of the ht series for the two lattices are comparable , receives further support .    in spite of the sizable extension of the series , both in the _ sq _ and in the _ tr _ lattice cases , the study of the indicator function @xmath75 ( or of analogous functions of different correlation - moments ) , </S>",
    "<S> does not show very sharp improvements in the accuracy of the determination of the exponent @xmath26 , for which we consistently obtain the estimate @xmath76 .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath23 , essentially the same estimate of @xmath26 is obtained from a da analysis of the series expansions of @xmath77 and of @xmath78 both in the case of the _ sq _ and of the _ tr _ lattices . </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath79 , we can estimate the non - universal parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 .    in order to get alternative estimates of @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> , we may also try to analyze directly the large - order behavior of the expansion coefficients of @xmath33 and of @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath23 and using the known value of @xmath83 , we can fit the series coefficients of these quantities to their expected@xcite asymptotic behavior @xmath84 $ ] with @xmath85 in the case of the susceptibility , while @xmath86 in the case of @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> both in the case of the _ sq _ and of the _ tr _ lattices , using the sets of coefficients of the susceptibility and of the correlation length , we can estimate @xmath87 from the ratio @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate is however suspect because , assuming @xmath89 , we can consistently estimate @xmath90 in the case of the _ sq _ lattice and @xmath91 in the case of the _ tr _ lattice . </S>",
    "<S> thus we must suppose that the series coefficients are not yet near enough to their asymptotic values that the value of @xmath24 can be reliably estimated by this direct analysis , in spite of the fact that the ratio @xmath88 already takes the expected value .    finally , it is also interesting to notice that , as indicated in our previous analysis@xcite , a study of the function @xmath92 , of its logarithm and of its log - derivative , supports the arguments of ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ ] concerning the absence of singular multiplicative corrections by powers of @xmath34 to the critical behavior of @xmath93 and gives results completely consistent with the assumption that @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed if @xmath94 or if @xmath95 , but there were in @xmath93 singular multiplicative corrections , either pad approximants or das of the above quantities should detect some singular behavior as @xmath96 , which , at the present orders of expansion , is not seen at all .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> our recent ht series data confirm the bkt predictions for the critical behavior of the xy system and confirm or improve the existing estimates of the critical parameters for both the _ sq _ and the _ tr _ lattices . </S>"
