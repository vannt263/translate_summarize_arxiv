    "<S> , los angeles , ca 90095 + @xmath4wcheng@physics.ucla.edu , + @xmath5gelmini@physics.ucla.edu    the possible role of neutrino degeneracy in nucleosynthesis has been studied several times from 1967 onwards @xcite @xcite . a large number of electron neutrinos , @xmath6 , present during nucleosynthesis yields a reduction of the neutron to proton ratio @xmath7 , through the reaction @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn lowers the @xmath9 abundance , since when nucleosynthesis takes place essentially all neutrons end up in @xmath9 nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> extra neutrinos of any flavor would increase the energy density of the universe , leading to an earlier decoupling of weak interactions and consequent increase of @xmath7 ( and @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this last effect is less important than the former one in the case of electron neutrinos , but it is the only effect of an excess of muon and/or tau neutrinos , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> thus when both the chemical potentials of @xmath12 and of @xmath13 , @xmath14 are large , their effect largely compensate each other . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to obtain light element abundances in agreement with observations even for values of the baryon to photon ratio @xmath15 much larger than in standard nucleosynthesis , which is @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the usually quoted nucleosynthesis upper bound on the cosmological density of baryons @xmath17 may be falsified and much larger values of @xmath17 become allowed by nucleosynthesis , even @xmath18 ( which corresponds to @xmath19 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> more restrictive upper bounds on @xmath17 can be obtained , however , by examining other consequences of a large lepton number @xcite . due to the electric charge neutrality of the universe , the excess of protons with respect to antiprotons must be accompanied by the same excess of electrons over positrons , so @xmath20 @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> a larger lepton number can reside only in neutrinos </S>",
    "<S> . we will be interested in values of @xmath22 @xmath23 of order one . </S>",
    "<S> thus to a very high accuracy @xmath24 , where @xmath25 . </S>",

    "<S> the asymmetries @xmath28 are related to the chemical potentials , @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 are dimensionless chemical potentials , @xmath32 is the @xmath33 dependent entropy number of degrees of freedom , i.e. @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 , and the numerical relation holds during nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> notice that , with only the relativistic particles in the standard model present during nucleosynthesis , the relation between the temperature of neutrinos , @xmath37 , and the temperature of photons , @xmath33 , is given by @xmath38 , both before and after @xmath39 annihilation , what means @xmath40 before @xmath39 annihilation . in the presence of large neutrino asymmetries </S>",
    "<S> this relation holds only if @xmath41 @xcite . for larger @xmath42 , instead , @xmath37 would be lower , since the neutrino decoupling temperature becomes larger than the muon mass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after neutrino decoupling , @xmath28 and @xmath43 are constant , and so are the @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy density of stable relativistic neutrinos , @xmath44~,\\ ] ] leads to an upper bound on the @xmath42 due to the limit on the present total energy density of the universe ( in units of the critical density ) , @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the bound is @xmath46 for @xmath47 , as required if @xmath48 and @xmath49yr in a radiation dominated universe @xcite ( @xmath50 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km / sec mpc , @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the present age of the universe ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , galaxy formation arguments provide a stronger upper limit . </S>",
    "<S> stable relativistic neutrinos in the large numbers considered here would maintain the universe radiation dominated ( by the neutrinos ) for much longer ( thus until lower temperatures ) than in the standard cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> requesting neutrinos to become subdominant before the recombination epoch , kang and steigman @xcite found , using nucleosynthesis bounds , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and , therefore , @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this is an upper bound on @xmath17 almost an order of magnitude larger than obtained in conventional nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> this would , for example , provide a solution to what some call  the x - ray cluster baryon crisis \" @xcite @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the conventional nucleosynthesis bound on @xmath17 combined with the measurement of a  large \" amount of gas in rich clusters of galaxies leads to an upper bound on the amount of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe , i.e. @xmath57 @xcite . if @xmath58 , as all measurements confirm , this would mean @xmath59 , namely that we either live in an open universe or in a universe with a cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> since the upper bound just mentioned on @xmath60 is proportional to the nucleosynthesis upper bound on @xmath17 , making the latter one order of magnitude larger would eliminate this  crisis \" . </S>",
    "<S> notice that using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ asymm ] ) , the kang and steigman the bound @xmath61 translates into @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> the production itself of a very large @xmath1 is problematic . in the standard out - of - equilibrium decay scenario for the generation of the baryon asymmetry both @xmath63 and @xmath1 are typically small . </S>",
    "<S> the largest asymmetries produced in this scenario are of order @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the number density of decaying particles and @xmath66 is the cp - violating parameter that gives the lepton number generated per decay . taking the generic value @xmath67 at early times , we see that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are necessary to get at most to @xmath70 . even if these values can be arranged for , they are not easy to obtain in realistic models @xcite . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> if the baryon and lepton number violating ( but @xmath71 conserving ) reactions due to sphalerons are in equilibrium after the production of an asymmetry @xmath1 , they will result in @xmath72 , implying that the total @xmath1 must be as small as @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if individual lepton numbers are large they should ( almost ) cancel each other ( with a fine tuning of eight orders of magnitude if @xmath73 ) .    here we present a viable model , where naturally a large lepton number asymmetry can be generated , @xmath74 , corresponding to @xmath75(see eq . ( [ asymm ] ) ) , namely , much larger , by seven to ten orders of magnitude , than the baryon asymmetry b. we use the most efficient mechanism to produce a large fermion number asymmetry , i.e. the decay of a scalar condensate carrying fermion number in a supersymmetric model , as first proposed by affleck and dine in 1985 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because we want to generate only a large @xmath1 ( not a large @xmath63 also ) , we consider models with a s - neutrino condensate .    </S>",
    "<S> most of the previous work dealing with the possibility of @xmath76 either @xcite @xcite did not take into account the conversion of @xmath1 into @xmath63 due to sphaleron mediated processes before the electroweak phase transition @xcite ( for temperatures @xmath77 , or @xcite did not actually dealt with the production of a large @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> only the following two potentially viable type of models have being so far proposed , to our knowledge , both very different from the model we present here . </S>",
    "<S> one of them is due to dolgov and kirilova @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they pointed out that a large @xmath1 and small @xmath63 could result within the affleck and dyne scenario , if very different rates of particle production ( due to oscillations in field directions perpendicular to each flat direction ) could be arranged for the @xmath1 and @xmath63 carrying flat directions , through a choice of coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> since particle production depletes the charge stored in the condensate , they suggested that the initially large @xmath63 charge might be efficiently dumped by particle production and not the large @xmath1 charge . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , models where a large @xmath1 asymmetry could be generated at low temperatures due to neutrino - antineutrino oscillations have been proposed @xcite recently .    </S>",
    "<S> our model is based on the affleck and dyne mechanism to generate a large @xmath1 and on the idea , proposed by linde twenty years ago @xcite , that , in the presence of a large enough lepton asymmetry @xmath78 , the electroweak symmetry is never restaured at large temperatures , and , therefore , sphalerons are suppressed at all temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the necessary critical value @xmath79 depends on the standard higgs field mass . for higgs masses of 60 gev to 1 tev the critical values of @xmath80 needed at @xmath81 range from 2.4 to 13.3 @xcite . using the relation @xmath82 and considering that a typical value of @xmath32 at @xmath81 is @xmath83 , gives @xmath84(1.3 to 7.4 ) @xmath85 </S>",
    "<S> thus , if @xmath78 the weak gauge bosons are always massive and , consequently , the rate of sphaleron reactions is always much smaller than the rate of expansion of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath63 and @xmath1 would be preserved @xcite , or at most a very small fraction of a large @xmath1 could be converted into @xmath63 by out of equilibrium sphaleron reactions , giving origin to the small @xmath63 observed ( if no larger @xmath63 was produced earlier ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considering the bound from galaxy formation mentioned above , we are interested in generating an @xmath1 in the range @xmath86 .    the particular particle model we study is the minimal supersymmetric standard model supplemented with three electroweak singlet right handed neutrino superfields @xmath87 , @xmath88 ( whose scalar components will be denoted @xmath89 in what follows ) and supersymmetric masses @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> we take the @xmath87 mass terms to be diagonal for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , besides the terms of the mssm , this model has in the superpotential @xmath91 there is also a separate hidden inflationary sector , not leading to preheating @xcite , that we do not need to specify beyond giving the inflaton mass @xmath92 at the end of inflation and the inflaton decay rate @xmath93 , for which we only use that the inflaton coupling is gravitational ( i.e. @xmath94 ) , thus @xmath95 ( @xmath96 is the planck mass , @xmath97 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the see - saw mechanism is responsible for the mass of the light ( mostly left - handed ) neutrinos , with hierarchical right handed majorana masses @xmath98 and dirac neutrino masses @xmath99 where @xmath100 gev ( so that @xmath101 has eigenvalues @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 and , if @xmath105 is the lightest and @xmath106 the heaviest neutrino , for example , then @xmath107 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath108 is a flat direction of the potential during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that @xmath109 is smaller than the expansion rate of the universe during inflation , @xmath110 . in this case , through different possible mechanisms that we will explore later , the field @xmath108 may find itself at the end of inflation with a non - zero value , say @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> let us examine first how large @xmath111 needs to be , before studying the mechanisms that naturally can lead to the range of values needed .    </S>",
    "<S> the sequence of events we envision is the following ( see fig.1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath112) the inflaton @xmath113 starts oscillating about the true minimum of its potential when the expansion rate of the universe @xmath114 is @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> this requirement comes from the solution of the evolution of a classical field @xmath116 in an expanding universe , @xmath117 . assuming @xmath118 , the solution is oscillatory only for @xmath119 , while for @xmath120 the solution is overdamped and the field remains stuck at its initial value @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy in the inflaton oscillations redshifts like matter , so the universe becomes matter dominated ( md ) .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath122) through the same arguments the @xmath123 sneutrino field oscillations start when @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that at this point the inflaton energy density still dominates , @xmath125 .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath126) the @xmath127 event of our sequence , the decay of the inflaton , happens at a later time @xmath128 . using the md relation between h and t , we obtain that @xmath129 . at this point </S>",
    "<S> the universe becomes radiation dominated ( rd ) by the decay products of the inflaton .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath130) the sneutrino @xmath108 decays later at @xmath131 and using the rd relation between @xmath114 and @xmath132 , @xmath133 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath50 is the largest @xmath134 coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath50 is also the yukawa coupling constant that dominates the dirac mass @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , using @xmath136 , we can eliminate the constant @xmath50 in favor of the lightest neutrino mass in what follows .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath137)thermalization happens when the rate of interaction of particles in the universe , @xmath138 , becomes equal ( and then larger ) than the expansion rate of the universe , i.e. when @xmath139 , where @xmath26 is the number density of particles and @xmath140 their typical cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the actual lepton asymmetry is either generated or released when the @xmath141 sneutrino decays . </S>",
    "<S> we require to generate in total an asymmetry @xmath142 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important that the @xmath143 decay occurs before thermalization is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> if so , thermalization happens in the presence of a large lepton asymmetry that breaks the electroweak symmetry from the beginning of the thermal bath and , consequently , the rate of sphalerons is always suppressed .    </S>",
    "<S> let us examine the conditions for the previous sequence of events to be consistent . </S>",
    "<S> the measured anisotropy of the microwave background radiation requires @xmath144 to be @xmath145 gev in most models ( even if it may be lower , such as @xmath146 gev , in some ) @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we considered two variations of one scenario , one in which the inflaton energy dominates at reheating and another in which the sneutrino energy dominates then . in both cases we required @xmath1 to be large enough for the electroweak symmetry to be spontaneously broken at all temperatures after inflation , with the consequent suppression of sphaleron transitions . </S>",
