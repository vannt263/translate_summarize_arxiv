    "in the absence of neutrino reactions on a polarized target , the inclusive polarized deep inelastic lepton - hadron reactions determine only the sum of quark and anti - quark polarized parton density functions ( pdfs ) , @xmath2 , and provide no information at all about the individual polarized quark and anti - quark densities .",
    "all analyses of the polarized _ inclusive _ ( dis ) data have produced results for the polarized strange quark density function , @xmath3 , which are significantly _ negative _ for all values of @xmath1 ( see for instance ) , in contradiction to the positive values obtained from combined analyses of inclusive and semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering data using de florian , sassot , stratmann ( dss ) fragmentation functions ( ffs ) @xcite .",
    "this problem is known as the strange quark polarization puzzle .",
    "it was shown @xcite , however , that the polarized strange quark density is very sensitive to the kaon fragmentation functions , and if the set of hirai , kumano , nagai , sudoh ( hkns ) fragmentation functions @xcite is used , the polarized strange quark density obtained from the combined analysis turns out to be negative and well consistent with values obtained from the pure deep inelastic scattering analyses . since it has turned out that neither the hkns nor the dss ffs are consistent with the recent hermes data on pion and kaon _ multiplicities _ @xcite , one can conclude now that the values for the polarized strange quark density @xmath0 determined from the combined analyses and @xcite of the inclusive and semi - inclusive dis data , can not be correct .",
    "on the other hand , a disadvantage of the qcd analyses of the pure inclusive polarized dis data is that in all of them simple input parametrizations for the polarized strange quark density , which do not permit a sign change of the density , have been used .",
    "note that the value of the first moment of the polarized strange quark density must be negative .",
    "this follows from the experimental values for @xmath4 , the spin carried by all the quarks , and for @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the 8th component of the axial cabibbo current , with constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 determined from hyperon @xmath9 decays .",
    "thus if @xmath0 is positive for medium values of @xmath1 , it has to be negative at small values of @xmath1 , implying that there should be a sign change .",
    "the previous simple input parametrizations were used because the data did not allow a reasonable determination of the parameters responsible for the sign change @xcite .",
    "the situation has now changed .    in this paper",
    "we present a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd analysis of the polarized inclusive dis data including in the world data set the recent very precise jlab clas data on the proton and deuteron spin structure functions @xcite .",
    "the aim of our analysis is to answer the question if it is possible , in the presence of the new clas data , to determine the polarized strange quark density @xmath10 using a more general input parametrization which allows for a sign change . compared with our last fit to inclusive dis data @xcite ,",
    "the following changes are made :    ( i ) we use now more general input parametrizations for the sum of quark and anti - quark polarized pdfs @xmath11 instead of the valence and sea quark densities .",
    "in particular , for the polarized strange quark density , allowance is made for a sign change of the density .",
    "( ii ) we do not make any assumptions about the polarized light sea quark densities @xmath12 and @xmath13 which have been used in all previous analyses , because as was stressed above only the sums @xmath14 can be extracted from the data , and the assumptions made can not be tested .",
    "note here that in contrast to the light sea quark densities , the strange quark density @xmath15 can be well determined from the inclusive data if they are sufficiently precise .",
    "in addition , the compass proton data on the spin asymmetries @xcite , which were not available at the time of our last analysis of the inclusive dis data @xcite , have also been included .",
    "in this section we will present and discuss the results of our new nlo qcd fit to the present world data on polarized inclusive dis adding to the old data set ( @xcite-@xcite ) , used in our previous analysis @xcite , the compass proton data @xcite and the new clas data @xcite .",
    "the data used ( 902 experimental points ) cover the following kinematic region : @xmath16 .",
    "note that for the clas data a cut @xmath17 was imposed in order to exclude the resonance region .",
    "the method used is the same as in our previous qcd analysis of the inclusive dis data ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the main difference , as was mentioned in the introduction , is that we use now input parametrizations at @xmath18 for the sum of quark and antiquark polarized parton densities instead of the valence sea quark densities , which in addition are more general , @xmath19 \\nonumber x(\\delta d+\\delta \\bar{d})(x , q^2_0)&=&a_{d+\\bar{d}}x^ { \\alpha_{d+\\bar{d } } } ( 1-x)^{\\beta_{d+\\bar{d}}}(1+\\gamma_{d+\\bar{d}}x),\\\\[2 mm ] \\nonumber x(\\delta s+\\delta \\bar{s})(x , q^2_0)&=&a_{s+\\bar{s}}x^ { \\alpha_{s+\\bar{s } } } ( 1-x)^{\\beta_{s+\\bar{s}}}(1+\\gamma_{s+\\bar{s}}x),\\\\[2 mm ] x\\delta g(x , q^2_0)&=&a_{g}x^{\\alpha_{g } } ( 1-x)^{\\beta_g}(1+\\gamma_{g}x ) , \\label{input_pdfs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and do _ not _ use any assumptions about the light sea quark densities @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    as usual , the set of free parameters in ( [ input_pdfs ] ) is reduced by the well - known sum rules @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath6 are nonsinglet combinations of the first moments of the polarized parton densities corresponding to @xmath25 and @xmath26 components of the axial vector cabibbo current @xmath27 a_8&=&(\\delta u + \\delta\\bar{u})(q^2 ) + ( \\delta d + \\delta\\bar{d})(q^2)-2(\\delta s+\\delta\\bar{s})(q^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the sum rule ( [ ga ] ) reflects isospin su(2 ) symmetry , whereas ( [ 3fd ] ) is a consequence of the @xmath28 flavor symmetry treatment of the hyperon @xmath9 decays .",
    "so , using the constraints ( [ ga ] ) and ( [ 3fd ] ) the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 in ( [ input_pdfs ] ) can be determined as functions of the other parameters connected with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the large @xmath1 behavior of the polarized pdfs is mainly determined from the positivity constraints @xcite , where for the unpolarized nlo pdfs the mrst02 set of parton densities @xcite has been used . in order to guarantee the positivity condition for the polarized strange quarks and gluons we assume the following relation for the parameters @xmath33 which control their large @xmath1 behavior : @xmath34    the rest of the parameters @xmath35 , as well as the unknown higher twist corrections @xmath36 to the spin structure functions @xmath37 have been determined from the best fit to the dis data .",
    "note that the @xmath38 term has been used only in the parametrization for the @xmath39 density , because the parameters @xmath40 in front of it for the other polarized densities can not be determined from the fit , and do not help to improve it .",
    "note also that the higher twist effects are nonperturbative ones and can not be calculated in a model - independent way .",
    "that is why we prefer to extract them directly from the experimental data ( for more details , see our paper @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical results of our nlo qcd fit to the present world data set on polarized inclusive dis are presented in tables i , ii and iii .",
    "0.6 cm    [ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     0.6 cm",
    "we have stressed that , in principle , the inclusive dis data uniquely determine the polarized strange quark density . our new analysis of the inclusive world data , including for the first time the extremely accurate jlab clas data on the proton and deuteron spin structure functions and the recently published compass proton data , despite allowing in the parametrization , for a possible sign change , has confirmed the previous claim , namely , that the inclusive data yield significantly negative values for the polarized strange quark density .",
    "the fundamental difference between the sidis and dis analysis is the necessity in sidis to use information on the fragmentation functions , which are largely determined from multiplicity measurements . in an earlier study @xcite",
    "we showed that the polarized strange quark density extracted from sidis data was extremely sensitive to the input fragmentation functions .",
    "thus we believe that the present disagreement between the sidis and dis strange quark polarizations very likely results from a lack of correctness of the fragmentation functions utilized and that the results from the inclusive analysis are correct .",
