    "in dimension @xmath2 , the gravitational action may be modified to include higher order curvature terms while keeping the equations of motion to second order , provided the higher order terms appear in specific combinations corresponding to the gauss - bonnet invariants of even dimensions @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "string theory predicts that such gauss - bonnet terms arise as higher order corrections in the heterotic string effective action .",
    "the simplest of these terms is the four dimensional gauss - bonnet term .",
    "it arises as the next to leading order correction to the gravitational effective action in string theory @xcite and has recently been receiving considerable attention as a gravitational alternative to dark energy @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall be concerned with compact black objects in such theories .",
    "boulware and deser ( bd ) found exact black hole solutions  @xcite in a gravitational theory with a four dimensional gauss - bonnet term modifying the usual einstein - hilbert action .",
    "these solutions are generalizations of the @xmath0-dimensional black hole solutions found a long time ago by tangherlini  @xcite . under certain conditions , a single horizon enclosing a spacelike singularity exists and the global topology of the manifold is identical to that of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the thermodynamics of bd black holes was subsequently discussed by myers and simon  @xcite and by wiltshire   @xcite .",
    "they started from the observation of bardeen , carter and hawking  @xcite that the surface gravity is constant and inversely proportional to the periodicity in imaginary time of the metric , thus relating the temperature of the black hole to it . to construct a candidate entropy , they employed the same thermodynamic identities which appear in einstein gravity @xcite , identifying the euclidean action with the free energy .",
    "they then derived an expression for the entropy of a black hole in gauss - bonnet gravity , concluding that the entropy is not simply proportional to the area of the horizon of the black hole as it is in einstein gravity but rather has an extra term proportional to the gauss - bonnet coupling parameter .",
    "though it is a fairly natural identification to make , there is still no proof that the entropy so defined obeys the second law ( @xmath4 ) as this depends on the dynamics . due to its interest in string theory ,",
    "there have subsequently been many works studying the entropy of black holes in spherically symmetric gauss bonnet and lovelock gravity with positive an negative cosmological constant   @xcite , although a convincing treatment of the second law remains elusive in all cases .",
    "if some of the extra dimensions are compactified , then in addition to black hole solutions , black string solutions ( or  black membrane \" solutions ) also exist . while in einstein gravity",
    "these are trivial extensions of black hole solutions in extra dimensions , it has been pointed out by kobayashi and tanaka  @xcite that the solution has to be modified and an extra asymptotic charge , in addition to the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass   @xcite , appears in the presence of a gauss - bonnet term . in the current paper we set out to discuss the thermodynamic properties of black holes and the generalization of black strings to @xmath0 dimensions in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity , with @xmath1 compact dimensions .",
    "we compare the entropies of various black objects , which allows us , assuming that the second law of thermodynamics holds , to investigate their stability .    in sec .",
    "2 we summarize our knowledge of the thermodynamics of black holes in gauss - bonnet gravity for @xmath5 . in sec . 3 .",
    "we discuss black strings and their generalization to @xmath6  black branes . \" in sec .",
    "4 we will compare the entropies of black holes and black strings and construct a rough phase diagram for stable black objects .",
    "we conclude the paper and summarize our results in sec .",
    "5 . in the appendices we list the equations of motion and the coefficients of the @xmath7expansion of the metric tensor up to third order",
    "the action of einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity is@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath10 is the gauss - bonnet term . while the gauss - bonnet term is topological in @xmath11 , in @xmath12 @xmath13 is a scalar , modifying the action in a non - trivial manner .",
    "the variation of the action in ( [ action ] ) results in a modified einstein equation of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the einstein tensor and @xmath16 is the lanczos tensor .",
    "boulware and deser have found exact , spherically symmetric , static solutions of ( [ einstein ] ) at every @xmath5 .",
    "these have the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 the parameters @xmath19 amd @xmath20 are defined as follows : @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the volume of the @xmath24 dimensional unit sphere and @xmath25 is the adm mass .    the dimensions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are somewhat special . solving the equation for the horizon",
    "@xmath28 one finds a mass gap for black holes at @xmath26 .",
    "no black holes exist unless @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath27 black holes also have a mass gap , but for an entirely different reason . in @xmath27 ,",
    "small black holes are unstable due to a runaway mode  @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the black hole is obtained directly from the periodicity in imaginary time of the lapse function .",
    "one rotates to euclidean time ( @xmath30 ) and produces a smooth euclidean manifold by identifying @xmath31 with perdiodicity @xmath32 .",
    "this periodicity is reflected in the euclidean propagator of any quantum field propagating in the background spacetime and may be interpreted as indicating that the fields are in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature @xmath33 .",
    "one finds that the periodicity is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the surface gravity of the event horizon . for the black hole under consideration , the temperature as calculated by myers and simon @xcite and by wiltshire",
    "@xcite is @xmath36\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the horizon radius , satisfying @xmath38 . using the standard relationship between the temperature and the entropy @xmath39 where @xmath40 is mass independent",
    ", the expression for the entropy of the spherical black hole in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity becomes @xmath41 where following myers and simon  @xcite @xmath40 is set to zero .",
    "this differs from the expression of entropy in einstein gravity , in which the entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon .",
    "below we consider black membranes . in",
    "what follows , we will assume that the temperature is also given by @xmath42 where @xmath35 is the surface gravity of the membrane .",
    "further , we determine the entropy from ( [ temperature ] ) using ( [ entt ] ) and leave the second law of black hole thermodynamics for future consideration .",
    "recently , kobayashi and tanaka  @xcite ( kt ) have investigated black string solutions for @xmath26 of einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity with one spatial dimension compactified on a circle . however ,",
    "if one keeps future phenomenological applications in mind the case @xmath43 is more interesting as the @xmath26 arkani - hamed - dimopoulos - dvali ( add ) model  @xcite of large extra dimensions modifies newtonian gravity at unacceptably large distances .",
    "therefore , one of our aims has been to extend kt to @xmath6 . for simplicity",
    "we will choose a compactification on a symmetric torus @xmath44 .",
    "an unfortunate consequence of our more general approach is our inability to employ numerical methods for the investigation of the phase structure in the space of solutions .",
    "we will see , however , that an expansion in terms of the ratio @xmath45 , also proposed in kt , provides respectable results at all @xmath0 , where @xmath46 is the length associated with each toroidal dimension .",
    "kt have shown that , unlike in einstein gravity , black string solutions acquire a non - trivial second charge , @xmath47 , in addition to a mass parameter , @xmath25 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the metric components is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is newton s constant in @xmath0 dimensions . for black string solutions ( solutions with an event horizon )",
    "the two charges have a unique relationship that can be studied either numerically , or , by employing analytic expansion methods .",
    "we consider the explicit forms of these quantities in ( [ ctcw ] ) . for the metric describing a black membrane in @xmath0 dimensions , @xmath1 of which",
    "are compactified on a torus , we use the ansatz @xmath50 to derive the equations for the components of the metric for general @xmath0 we utilize the fact that the equations are polynomial in @xmath0 .",
    "these polynomials appear from summations over @xmath51 terms , with @xmath52 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "as the calculation of the einstein tensor requires at most two summations , the resulting expression is at most quadratic in @xmath0 .",
    "following similar considerations , we can conclude that the lanczos tensor is at most a quartic function of @xmath0 .",
    "the coefficients of various terms can than be identified by deriving these tensors at a few fixed values of @xmath0 .",
    "we list the nonzero components of the einstein and lanczos tensors for arbitrary @xmath0 in appendix a.    equation ( [ einstein ] ) has no known exact black brane solutions .",
    "however , one can study the black brane solutions in several different ways .",
    "following kt we employ expansions around the horizon and in the dimensionless variable @xmath53",
    ".      one can investigate black string solutions further by expanding the metric in a variable @xmath54 , where @xmath37 is the radius of the horizon  @xcite .",
    "this investigation yields the result that in @xmath26 the radius of the black string horizon has a lower bound @xmath55 .",
    "the generalization of this result to @xmath0 dimensions using the form of the einstein and lanczos tensors of appendix a is straightforward .",
    "we write the components of the metric  @xcite as @xmath56 substituting these expressions into ( [ einstein ] ) and solving for the coefficients provides the following expression for the leading coefficients ( the coefficient @xmath57 and @xmath58 are undetermined ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 . for all @xmath5",
    "the discriminant is positive , @xmath61 when @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is some ( dimension dependent ) positive critical value of @xmath64 and negative at @xmath65 ( above @xmath63 no real solutions exist ) .",
    "then the lower bound of the radius of the horizon is at @xmath66 . in particular , at @xmath26 @xmath67 , in agreement with kt .    to obtain information about the mass gap we need to associate the radius of the horizon with the mass . in the absence of exact solutions ,",
    "this can only be done with an expansion that converges both at the horizon and at infinity : the small @xmath68 expansion .",
    "since the maximal value of @xmath68 , relevant for black brane solutions is obtained from @xmath69 for all @xmath12 , it is likely that the expansion has favourable convergence properties .    combining this result with the series expansion of the next subsection we obtain a result for the minimal mass of black branes at @xmath70 .",
    "this will allow us to investigate the thermodynamics and phases of these black objects .      in the previous section we obtained an expression for the minimal radius of horizon of black branes .",
    "as shown by kt , at @xmath26 , such a minimum leads to a maximal value of the of the parameter @xmath71 for black strings , where @xmath25 is a mass parameter .",
    "we restrict ourselves to black branes with horizons , therefore it is natural to expect that black branes also satisfy similar bounds . furthermore ,",
    "as we do not employ numerical techniques , we restrict ourselves to an expansion of the metric components into a power series of the dimensionless parameter @xmath72 at fixed variable @xmath73 . as the range of @xmath32",
    "is bounded from above , we have a chance of obtaining useful information from such an expansion .    we will use the ansatz @xmath74 comparing with ( [ metric1 ] ) provides expressions for the expansion of functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 , in terms of @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively , which can than be substituted into ( [ einstein2 ] ) and ( [ lanczos2 ] )",
    ". then ( [ einstein ] ) gives linear differential equations for the expansion coefficients that can be solved order by order .",
    "the solutions of these equations for the first few expansion coefficients are listed in appendix b.    then ( [ beta - expansion ] ) can be used to determine the radius of the event horizon in @xmath68-expansion .",
    "the horizon radius can be expressed as @xmath80 where @xmath81 can be written as a power series in @xmath32 and @xmath82 . the horizon radius to 5th order in @xmath83 for @xmath27 @xmath84 using the lower bound obtained for the radius of the horizon we can derive lower bounds for the mass parameter , @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , we obtain the fifth order result for @xmath27 @xmath85 .",
    "the third order result for @xmath26 agrees to within 4.4% with the numerical value @xmath86 obtained in kt .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , the asymptotic charge @xmath47 has a unique relationship with @xmath25 .",
    "the non - vanishing value of @xmath47 is related to the relative tension introduced in the study of black holes in compactified einstein gravity  @xcite .",
    "@xmath47 can also be obtained in the @xmath68 expansion using equation ( [ beta - expansion ] ) and the expression for @xmath79 given in appendix b.      following myers and simon  @xcite we assume that the relationship between the temperature and the surface gravity is the same as in einstein gravity .",
    "therefore we have @xmath87 where @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a normalized time - like killing vector field and the right hand side is evaluated on the killing horizon , @xmath90 . using metric ( [ metric1 ] )",
    "the surface gravity is @xmath91 the surface gravity can easily be calculated using our @xmath68-expansion . for general @xmath0",
    "we obtain in fourth order the expression , @xmath92 while for @xmath27 in fifth order @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "it is instructive to investigate the convergence properties of ( [ kappa6 ] ) . assuming a finite radius of convergence we analyze the coefficients to find the radius of convergence and critical behavior .",
    "we choose the following simple ansatz for the coefficients @xmath95 using linear regression we find the following values @xmath96 the value of the critical exponent @xmath97 seems to indicate that the series converges at the critical point .",
    "the critical value of @xmath25 is given by @xmath98 this is in a excellent agreement with the critical value obtained from the horizon expansion , @xmath99 .",
    "the temperature is singular at the minimal value of mass , but it seems to stay finite at this point .",
    "it behaves like @xmath100 note that for integer @xmath101 an extra multiplier log@xmath102 appears in ( [ critical ] ) .",
    "though @xmath103 is finite at the critical mass , it becomes complex below this value , implying that the radius of the horizon is complex .",
    "having no real solution for the radius of horizon is equivalent to not having an event horizon : a naked singularity .",
    "naked singularities are expected to be unstable   @xcite .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics for d - dimensional black membranes with d-4 compactiifed dimensions reads @xcite @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the adm mass .",
    "for the case under consideration @xmath106= \\frac{l^{d-4}}{4g_d}\\left[2c_t-(d-4 ) c_w\\right],\\ ] ] and @xmath107 are tensions along the toroidal extra dimensions and are given by , @xmath108 = \\frac{l^{d-5}}{4g_d}\\left[c_t-(d-3)c_w\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath109 for all @xmath110 and @xmath111 and @xmath112 are leading order corrections to the metric @xmath113 and @xmath114 is the volume of the compact dimensions . using the formul  given in appendix b , we find , up to second order in @xmath32 @xmath115 we use the above expresions in ( [ definemadm ] ) and ( [ definetau ] ) to calculate @xmath116\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath117.\\ ] ] from here we calculate @xmath118\\cr\\cr \\frac{\\tau}{t}&=&\\frac{4\\pi g_d m_\\text{adm}^2}{l^{d-3}}\\left[1-\\beta'-\\frac{73}{40}\\left(\\frac{d-4}{d-2}\\right)\\beta'^2 + \\cdots\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 . with these equations",
    "we verify that the integrability conditions @xmath120 are satisfied .",

    "we quote their result below , @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 for egb gravity , and @xmath129 are the two orthonormal vectors orthogonal to @xmath130 , where @xmath130 is the horizon surface .",
    "the expression for entropy ( [ entstr2 ] ) agrees with that calculated from ( [ fursaev ] ) .",
    "the horizon radius @xmath37 of the spherical black hole in @xmath0 dimensions is obtained as the real , positive root of the equation @xmath38 , or @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath20 are defined in ( [ talpha ] ) and ( [ tm ] ) .",
    "this equation can not be solved exactly for general @xmath0 , but for @xmath27 one finds @xmath133 these formul   will no longer hold when we compactify @xmath1 dimensions .",

    "@xmath135 the exact expression for the entropy is not illuminating , but it is worth noting that its leading behavior is as @xmath136 ( for large @xmath137 ) so that it grows much slower than @xmath138 for the black membrane in ( [ entstr2 ] ) , whose leading behavior is @xmath139 . in fig 1",

    "<S> we investigate the thermodynamics of static black objects such as black holes , black strings and their generalizations to @xmath0 dimensions (  black branes \" ) in a gravitational theory containing the four dimensional gauss - bonnet term in the action , with @xmath1 dimensions compactified torus . </S>",
    "<S> the entropies of black holes and black branes are compared to obtain information on the stability of these objects and to find their phase diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the existence of a critical mass , which depends on the scale of the compactified dimensions , below which the black hole entropy dominates over the entropy of the black membrane . </S>"
