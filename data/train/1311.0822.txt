    "entropy rate has a close relationship with algorithmic complexity , also known as kolmogorov - chaitin complexity .",
    "algorithmic complexity measures the length of the shortest program , run in a universal turing machine , that allows to reproduce the analyzed sequence .",
    "it was introduced as an attempt to avoid probabilistic arguments in analyzing single data sets @xcite .",
    "it is closely related to randomness , as infinite sequence with maximum algorithmic complexity are random . as random sequences have maximum entropy rate , it is often inferred that finite sequences with maximum lz76 complexity are necessarily as random as they can be and viceversa @xcite , yet neither of these two assumptions are true as was recently demonstrated @xcite .    in an earlier paper @xcite , the authors showed that from the algorithmic nature of the lz76 factorization , there is a definite way to construct maximum lz76 complexity sequences ( we will call such sequences mlzs ) , that allows a much sorter description that the string itself . in this paper",
    "we will discuss the properties of such sequences .",

    "if @xmath12 then @xmath6 will be the empty string .",
    "let the  drop  operator @xmath13 be defined as    @xmath14    and , consequently ,    @xmath15    the lempel - ziv factorization @xmath16 of the string @xmath11    @xmath17    in @xmath18 factors is such , that each factor @xmath19 complies with    1 .",

    "@xmath21 except , perhaps , for the last factor @xmath22 .",
    "the first condition defines @xmath16 as a history of @xmath11 , while the second condition defines such history as an exhaustive history of @xmath11 .",
    "the partition @xmath16 is unique for every string @xcite .    for example the exhaustive history of the sequence    @xmath23",

    "@xmath25 is bounded by @xcite    @xmath27    it has been discussed @xcite that this limit is attained for extremely long strings that can go beyond @xmath28 for the binary case , being even worse for larger alphabets ( see below ) .",

    "an example for an alphabet @xmath49 will start by the alphabet symbols    @xmath50    next , consider the set of all length two strings : @xmath51 .",
    "the first element of the set will be a component of the exhaustive history of the sequence , so it will be append to the string    @xmath52    the second element in the set @xmath53 is already present as the substring @xmath54 , thus , it is discarded .",
    "the third , fourth , fifth and last element contributes to the exhaustive history    @xmath55    now turn to the length three set of strings and repeat the same procedure and so forth .",
    "it is clear that the above algorithm will yield a maximum lz76 complexity string for a given string length @xmath48 .    by construction",
    ", the maximum lz76 complexity string is not unique .",
    "if we choose to test the candidate factor in any other order besides lexicographic order , a different sequence will happen .",
    "the set of all maximum lz76 complexity sequences has been called mlzs .",
    "the asymptotic bounding value for the lz76 complexity given by equation ( [ asymp ] ) , is deduced from the limit to the asymptotic function @xcite    @xmath56\\log{n}}.\\ ] ]    where    @xmath57    is a slowly decaying function of @xmath48 .",
    "it should be emphasized that one problem with equation ( [ epsilonasymp ] ) is that its interval of validity is given by the condition @xmath58 , which is not the case for every value of @xmath48 .",
    "figure [ epsilonfig]a shows the value of @xmath48 for which @xmath59 for increasing alphabet size @xmath36 . for an alphabet size of @xmath60 ,",
    "the validity is already in the order of @xmath61 .",
    "even worse , @xmath62 is a very slowly decaying function of @xmath48 , figure [ epsilonfig]b plots the value of the @xmath48 for which @xmath63 for increasing alphabet size .",
    "already for the binary alphabet , the value of @xmath48 is of the order of @xmath28 , and can reach @xmath64 for alphabet size @xmath65 ( cardinality of western languages alphabets ) .    the bound value given by equation ( [ asymp ] ) is only reached for extremely large strings and on the other hand , the bound value given by equation ( [ epsilonasymp ] ) is , for small , and not so small , values of @xmath48 a to gross approximation .",
    "indeed , figure [ epsilonmlzs ] shows the lz76 complexity of the mlzs , equation ( [ asymp ] ) and equation ( [ epsilonasymp ] ) .",
    "it is evident that while the asymptotic value is not an upper bound for the lz76 complexity up to @xmath0 symbols , the bound given by equation ( [ epsilonasymp ] ) is well above the maximum lz76 complexity attainable .",
    "mlzs are non - random strings by construction , this is probably its most striking property .",
    "ziv theorem @xcite , given by equation ( [ zivtheorem ] ) , could wrongly induce to infer that random strings of finite length should achieve the maximum possible lz76 complexity for that length .",
    "this is not the case as has been already reported @xcite .",
    "a truly random source will output any string of length @xmath48 with probability @xmath66 , without regard for the actual string being produced . a typical random string ,",
    "will be given by any string that can pass the universal martin - lf test of randomness @xcite .",
    "such string will have several properties one of which , is maximum algorithmic complexity as well as , normality in borel sense @xcite .",
    "a sequence is considered normal in borel sense , if the probability of occurrence of all @xmath34-length patterns are equal , and tend to @xmath67 for infinite strings .",
    "it has been reported that mlzs are not normal in borel sense @xcite .",
    "louchard and szpankowski @xcite has studied the probability distribution of factors length in a lempel - ziv factorization slightly different from the one studied in this contribution.they found that for a biased bernoulli model ( symbols are drawn from a binary alphabet with different probability @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , the distribution of length follows a gaussian law .",
    "figure [ histolength]a shows the length distribution for both the random sequence factorization , and the mlzs factorization using the lz76 scheme described above .",
    "the string length was taken as @xmath70 and @xmath71 strings for each case were taken .",
    "results are from the average values .",
    "the random string shows a gaussian distribution with mean length value of @xmath72 and standard deviation of @xmath73 .",
    "the mlzs , on the other hand , exhibit a length distribution far from being gaussian with an sudden cut - off length value of @xmath74 , where the number of factors of length above this value falls abruptly .",
    "we normalize the number of factors for each length @xmath39 , by the total number of strings of that given length @xmath75 , the results is shown in figure [ histolength ] .",
    "each value corresponds to the fraction of factors of length @xmath39 that actually comes into the factorization .",
    "the behavior for both the random and the mlzs strings are similar in nature , decreasing with factor length . for all lengths , the fraction of factors in the random strings are smaller that those for the mlzs .",
    "w e can calculate a shannon entropy related magnitude over the length distribution as    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is a probability defined by the fraction of factors of length @xmath39 in the lz factorization of @xmath11 , relative to the total number of different binary strings of length @xmath39 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "it must be noted that this is not strictly a true shannon entropy , as the sum of the probabilities @xmath77 are not normalized .    for the random string this gives a value @xmath78 compared with @xmath79 for the mlzs .",
    "there is more surprise , on average , in the length distribution of the random string that the one found in the mlzs , which corresponds to less uniform distribution of the mlzs compared to the random case .",
    "it may be asked if the complexity of the resulting mlzs are significantly sensitive to the ordering chosen in the testing step , this seems not to be the case .",
    "five thousand sequences were built using random ordering in the test step .",
    "figure [ histomlzs]a shows the histogram of the lz76 complexity value for length ranging from @xmath80 to @xmath81 symbols , it can be seen that the dispersion of values is very narrow for each length .",
    "figure [ histomlzs]b shows that the relative standard deviation falls rapidly with increasing sequence length , being already below @xmath82 for the @xmath80 symbol sequences .      the mlzs are by construction non stationary and non random",
    ". the non stationary character of the mlzs is result of the construction procedure .",
    "how sensitive are the mlzs to the starting point for factorization can be seen in figure [ stationarity ] .",
    "the figure plots the estimated entropy rate for the mlzs , starting the factorization at different positions of the mlz string .",
    "all strings where @xmath70 length . the entropy rate was estimated from the lz76 complexity value for the whole string , normalized by the lz76 complexity of the original mlzs .",
    "it can be seen that the entropy rate drops as we factorize starting further along the mlzs strings .",
    "we corrupted the mlzs strings with white noise in order to study their sensibility to noise .",
    "a fraction @xmath68 of sites chosen randomly were flipped in the original mlzs . for such corrupted vector of values ,",
    "the lz76 factorization was carried out and the lz76 complexity calculated .",
    "the entropy rate was estimated using the lz76 normalization .",
    "for each @xmath68 value , @xmath83 strings were used for the calculation and averaged values are reported .",
    "figure [ mlzsnoise ] shows the behavior of the estimated entropy with percentage of noise .",
    "there is an abrupt fall of entropy rate up to @xmath84 and then , a slight increase followed by a certain stabilization can be observed .",
    "finally , the mlzs was modeled using the empirical ansatz    @xmath85    where @xmath86 , @xmath87 are fitting parameters .",
    "the @xmath88 value for the fit was nearly one ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the fitted @xmath87 value was @xmath90 , very close to @xmath91 which corresponds to the expected asymptotic value , while @xmath86 was fitted to @xmath92 .",
    "figure [ fitmlzs]a shows the agreement of the fitted function with the actual data in a log scale .",
    "the absolute relative errors of the fitted function with the data values ( residuals ) are shown in figure [ fitmlzs]b , the relative errors do not exceed the @xmath93 for string lengths above @xmath94 symbols .",
    "maximum lempel - ziv complexity sequence are far from random and can be generated by a deterministic algorithm of size @xmath95 which makes them of negligible algorithmic complexity , exactly the opposite to a random string .",
    "mlzs are mostly insensitive to the order in which the possible factors in the exhaustive history are tested .",
    "mlzs do not show normality in borel sense and the factor length distributions departs markedly from the gaussian distribution with an abrupt cut - off value for large enough factors .",
    "compared to the random sequence , the mlzs have smaller shannon entropy of the length distribution .",
    "the analytical asymptotic values in used , are only valid for very large sequences that can go up to @xmath28 symbols .",
    "mlzs are strongly non stationary and a gradually loss of entropy rate happens as we start factorization dropping larger initial segments of the sequence . the same behavior was observed when the mlzs were corrupted with white noise , in this case an abrupt drop of entropy rate down to 0.89 happened , when only 0.06 fraction of sites were flipped .",
    "we finally introduced an empirical ansatz for describing the lz76 complexity of the mlzs which behaved very good in the whole range of sequence lengths , with relative error not surpassing 2% .",
