    "in the standard electroweak theory , flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes are strongly suppressed and can only occur via higher - order effects .",

    "such processes are ideal places to look for signals of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .    in the sm ,",
    "the fcnc @xmath0 decay is predominantly a cp conserving process .",
    "its branching fraction is sensitive to the real part of the @xmath10 transition amplitude , while the related decays @xmath11 and @xmath12 sense the imaginary part and absolute value , respectively . like these decays ,",

    "the sm predicts the branching fraction to be @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "although the prediction is solid in the sm , there is a possibility of enhancements from new physics contributions .",
    "in fact , phenomenological analyses give constraints on possible enhancements by up to an order of magnitude within the allowed range of new physics parameters from known kaon decays , including the measured branching fraction of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in addition , a new particle @xmath8 which decays into invisible particles , can also contribute to the three body decay @xmath15 .",
    "there is also a possibility of having new pseudoscalar particles , as predicted by several supersymmetry models .",
    "searches for the @xmath16 or @xmath17 modes and comparisons with the models have been made @xcite , and similar test should also be tried in the @xmath18 final state .    the e391a experiment at the kek 12-gev proton synchrotron made the first search for the @xmath0 decay , based on the data sample taken in the first stage ( run - i ) .",
    "an upper limit on the branching fraction of 4.7@xmath7 at the 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) for @xmath19 was obtained @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the run - i data were compromised by large neutron backgrounds from a vacuum membrane that hung in the beam .",
    "this article is based on the e391a data taken in the periods from february to april in 2005 ( run - ii ) and from november to december in 2005 ( run - iii ) , after correcting the problem .",
    "these data had six times more @xmath2 decays and were analyzed with improved methods .",
    "the e391a detector was primarily designed to search for the @xmath20 decay @xcite .",
    "it had a csi calorimeter to detect two photons from a @xmath21 decay and hermetic veto counters to ensure that no other visible particles existed in the final state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : detector ] ) . to avoid backgrounds from interactions of the beam particles with air ,",
    "most of the detector components were placed in a vacuum vessel .",
    "the csi calorimeter consisted of 496 blocks of @xmath22 @xmath23 undoped csi crystal .",
    "a @xmath24 @xmath25 beam hole was located at the center of the calorimeter to allow the beam particles to pass through . the main barrel ( mb ) and front barrel ( fb )",
    "counters were sandwiches of lead plates and plastic - scintillation counters with 13.5 @xmath26 and 17.5 @xmath26 , respectively , and formed cylindrical walls surrounding the @xmath27 decay volume .",
    "collar shaped counters ( cc00 , cc02@xmath2807 ) were placed around the beam line for vetoing photons along the beam axis . charged particles that would hit the csi calorimeter",
    "were identified and rejected by energy deposits in a charge veto ( cv ) scintillation - counter hodoscope , located 50 cm upstream ; it covered the front face as well as the outer wall of the beam - hole area .",
    "beam - hole charge veto ( bhcv ) and back - anti ( ba ) counters were located in the downstream region along the beam axis and outside of the vacuum vessel .",
    "the bhcv consisted of eight 3-mm - thick plastic - scintillation counters , which were arranged to fully cover the downstream area of the beam hole .",
    "the ba was made of six superlayers , each consisting of a lead / scintillator sandwich and quartz blocks for run - ii . for run - iii",
    "the ba had five superlayers , where the lead / scintillator sandwich part was replaced by the lead tungsten oxide ( pwo ) crystals ; this change was the only difference in the e391a detector system between the run - ii and run - iii periods .",
    "data acquisition was made with a hardware trigger that required two or more electromagnetic showers in the csi calorimeter with total energy @xmath29 60 mev , and no obvious activity in the cv and other veto counters .",
    "loose on - line veto requirements were imposed , which ensured flexibility of setting energy thresholds consistently for the real data and the detector simulation during the off - line analysis .",
    "the @xmath30 decay should produce exactly four showers in the csi calorimeter and nothing else in all the other counters .",
    "these hits should also satisfy an in - time requirement to suppress backgrounds .",
    "the experimental signature of @xmath0 is four photons in the final states with a non - zero missing mass and a transverse momentum .",
    "photons were registered in the csi calorimeter as energy deposits in adjacent blocks ( clusters ) .",
    "the most probable hit position of the photon was obtained from the shower energy distribution among the csi blocks .",
    "events with four photon clusters in the csi were selected for further off - line processing .",
    "reconstruction of a pair of photons was made by assuming that they were from a @xmath21 that decayed on the beam axis ( @xmath31-axis ) .",
    "multiple pairings of four photons to reconstruct two @xmath21s were eliminated by taking the combination that gave the minimum @xmath32 value in the difference in @xmath31 vertices .",
    "a cut on the minimum @xmath32 for the common @xmath31 vertex @xmath33 was effective for good @xmath21 identification . also , requiring a large difference in the lowest two @xmath32 values was effective in reducing the combinatorial error .",
    "we required that the common @xmath21-decay vertex point @xmath33 should be in the decay volume 300 cm @xmath34 500 cm .",
    "the veto conditions on the mb , cv , and collar counters were carefully tuned . among these counters ,",
    "the mb played a major role in vetoing photons undetected by the csi calorimeter .",
    "if too low an energy - threshold was imposed for all of the mb counters , back - splash from the csi / cv surface and electromagnetic shower leakage from the outer part of the csi calorimeter to the downstream area of the mb would cause acceptance loss .",
    "thus , we applied a tighter threshold to the upstream region of the mb to detect photons with a high efficiency , and a looser threshold to the downstream region of the mb to keep a large acceptance for the signal @xcite . suppression of the fusion cluster ( misidentification of two close - by clusters as one cluster ) was made by using the neural network ( nn ) technique trained by the stand - alone photons and the fusion clusters from the @xmath35 monte carlo ( mc ) simulation sample .",
