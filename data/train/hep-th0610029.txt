    "after creation of quantum mechanics , many attempts were made to understand a quantum side of gravity . with time , a commonly accepted now opinion has been summed that quantum gravity is a high - energy phenomenon which should manifest itself only on a huge scale of energies of the order of the planck energy @xmath0 gev",
    ". an important difference of existing models of quantum gravity from other quantum models of elementary particle physics is their primordially accepted _",
    "geometrical _ base .",
    "perhaps , many difficulties are conditioned namely by this circumstance .",
    "poorness of the set of predicted or expected effects @xcite is casted to an eye on the `` output '' of such the models , and i think that the very eloquent assertion by s. carlip may summarize the situation : `` ... there is not yet any direct experimental evidence that gravity is quantized '' @xcite",
    ".    models with large extra dimensions @xcite lead us to tev - scale gravity , and , maybe , they appropinquate us to a real energy scale of quantum gravity . but",
    "the notion that all our world is not any more than a slice of a real and non - available ( as a whole ) for us world is not very reassuring .",
    "extra dimensions are _ necessary _ to describe , for example , the composite fundamental fermions @xcite when they may by interpreted as internal coordinates of the composite system , but their assignement to any `` empty '' point of space seems to me to be an excess .",
    "but there exists another side of medal .",
    "nesvizhevsky s team reported about discovery of quantum states of ultra - cold neutrons in the earth s gravitational field @xcite . observed energies of levels ( it means that and their differences too ) in full agreement with quantum - mechanical calculations turned out to be equal to @xmath1 ev .",
    "if transitions between these levels are accompanied with irradiation of gravitons then energies of irradiated gravitons should have the same order that is of 40 orders lesser than the planck energy .",
    "anderson s team reported about the anomalous acceleration of nasa s probes pioneer 10/11 @xcite ; this effect is not embedded in a frame of the general relativity , and its magnitude is somehow equal to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hubble constant , @xmath4 is the light velocity . in the same 1998 , two teams of astrophysicists reported about dimming remote supernovae @xcite ; the one would be explained on a basis of the doppler effect if at the present epoch the universe expands with acceleration .",
    "this explanation needs an introduction of some `` dark energy '' which is unknown from any laboratory experiment .",
    "but the last effect as well as the pioneer anomaly may be explained as the additional manifestations of low - energy quantum gravity based on the idea of an existence of the graviton background @xcite .",
    "the main results of author s research in this approach are considered here ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",
    "we should observe the following effects in the see of gravitons : a redshift due to forehead collisions of photons with gravitons and an additional relaxation of any light flux due to their none - forehead collisions @xcite .",
    "the first effect leads to the geometrical distance / redshift relation of the form : @xmath5 where @xmath6 @xmath3 is the hubble constant .",
    "the both effects give the luminosity distance @xmath7 @xmath8 this function fits supernova observations very well for roughly @xmath9 that excludes a need of any dark energy to explain supernovae dimming .",
    "total galaxy number counts @xmath10 ( see @xcite ) . a graph of this function is shown in fig . 1",
    "; the typical error bar and data point are added here from paper @xcite by loh and spillar .",
    "there is not a visible contradiction with observations .",
    "= 12.98 cm    usually , one ascribes the decrease of galaxy number counts per a `` unit volume '' to an expansion of the universe . but _ there is not any expansion in this model_.    the galaxy number counts / magnitude relation @xmath11 @xmath12 is a magnitude , in this model ( see @xcite ) , which takes into account the schechter luminosity function @xcite , gives us another possibility to test a reality of the graviton background . to compare this function with observations by yasuda et al .",
    "@xcite , we can choose the normalizing factor from the condition : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the function giving the best fit to observations @xcite , @xmath15 in this case , we have two free parameters of the schechter distribution - @xmath16 and @xmath17 - to fit observations , and the latter one is connected with a constant @xmath18 the ratio @xmath19 is shown in fig.2 for different values of @xmath20 by @xmath21    = 12.98 cm    if we compare this figure with figs .",
    "6,10,12 from @xcite , we see that the considered model provides a no - worse fit to observations than the function @xmath22 if the same k - corrections are added ( perhaps , even a better one if one takes into account positions of observational points in these figures by @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .    in all of the three cases - supernova dimming , total galaxy number counts / redshift and galaxy number counts / magnitude relations - we can see a good enough accordance of the theory with observations .",
    "the single graviton screening creates _ equal _ attractive and repulsive forces for any pair of usual bodies @xcite .",
    "the forces are very big , about three order greater than the newtonian force",
    ". the net force can not be equal to zero in a case of black hole , and we have immediately a very important consequence : _ the equivalence principle should be violated if black holes exist . _    it was shown by the author that graviton pairing may ensure the newtonian attraction . in this model , the cross - section of interaction depends bilinear on particle energies ; then , after destruction of graviton pairs in a collision with a body , single scattered gravitons give a repulsive force which is twice smaller than an attractive one due to a pressure of pairs .",
    "it turns out that one should consider a space distribution of gravitons and their pairs in a realization of flat wave to compute the newton constant . today",
    "this model is a semi - classical one , but it is an underlaying one relative to the newtonian limit and the general relativity ( the newton constant is _",
    "computable _ here ) .",
    "it is interesting and absolutely unexpected that the model needs an `` atomic structure '' of matter to be _",
    "workable_. the following condition of big distances is necessary to use a geometrical language in gravity : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cross - section of interaction of a particle with an energy @xmath27 and a graviton pair with an average energy @xmath28 , @xmath29 is a distance between them . for a proton",
    ", this condition leads to the restriction : @xmath30 .",
    "this limit length is many orders greater than the planck scale of @xmath31 . by distances smaller than @xmath32",
    "the equivalence principle should be broken .",
    "this prediction may mean that any consideration of gravity in a geometrical language is nonsense in this forbidden scale .",
    "in the considered model , we start from a micro level but we see immediately such the very important and long time observed cosmological effect as redshifts of remote objects . a deceleration of massive bodies ( of the order of @xmath33 ) , when they move relative to the graviton background , is an analog of this effect .",
    "a similar deceleration has been observed only for the pioneer 10/11 spacecrafts @xcite , and the problem is open what is happen for big bodies . during almost a century ( from 1922 , when redshifts were first observed ) , nobody thought that the cosmological redshift may be considered as an effect of low - energy quantum gravity .",
    "i would like to hope that in the future it will be recognized as the one in a shorter time .",
