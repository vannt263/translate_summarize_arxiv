    "psr b0656 + 14 is a middle - aged ( @xmath2 yrs ) isolated neutron star , detected as a radio ( 385 ms ) as well as an x - ray pulsar by rosat @xcite , which confirmed the x - ray pulsation hinted in the discovery data of the einstein satellite @xcite . a possible identification of the pulsar in gamma - rays",
    "was also claimed @xcite but so far only a marginal evidence of pulsations was found in the gro / egret data . although dispersion measure estimates put psr b0656 + 14 at @xmath3 760 pc ,",
    "its true distance remains highly uncertain .",
    "indeed , assuming for the neutron star a canonical radius of 10 km , blackbody fits to the soft thermal component of its x - ray spectrum @xcite impose a significant downward revision of the nominal distance .",
    "psr b0656 + 14 could thus join the thin crowd of pulsars detected within few hundred pc of the sun .",
    "since psr b0656 + 14 is inside the putative supernova remnant known as monogem ring , the measurement of its proper motion was a natural way to investigate their possible association .",
    "thus , 3 radio images of the field , covering roughly 4 years , were collected by @xcite from the nrao very large array yielding a proper motion value of @xmath4 mas / yr ; @xmath5 mas / yr and ruling out the possible association .",
    "the proper motion value was later revised by @xcite in @xmath6 mas / yr and @xmath7 mas / yr ( pa=@xmath8 ) , which , although rather uncertain , shall be taken as the radio `` reference '' value . in the optical , a likely counterpart to psr b0656 + 14 ( m@xmath0 25 ) was proposed by @xcite on the basis of its positional coincidence with the radio pulsar . for the possible range of the pulsar distance ( @xmath9 pc ) ,",
    "the optical emission of the candidate counterpart was found to be well above the predictions based on both the magnetospheric emission model of @xcite and the extrapolation of the soft x - ray blackbody emission @xcite .",
    "indeed , multicolor photometry , reported by @xcite , gave support to this identification by showing a composite spectral shape , which could be interpreted as a magnetospheric component superimposed to a thermal one . to assess the reliability of the proposed optical identification",
    ", @xcite tried to use proper motion as a distinctive character of the pulsar .",
    "the original eso/3.6 m and ntt observations of @xcite were compared to a newly acquired hst / wfpc2 one to search for the object s displacement . at that time , the limited positional accuracy achievable with the ground based images hampered the astrometric measurements and no conclusive result could be obtained . soon thereafter ,",
    "optical pulsations at the radio / x - ray period were detected , at a 4 @xmath10 level , from the proposed counterpart @xcite , thus apparently closing the identification issue .",
    "however , the limited significance of this detection calls for a clear confirmation through new and independent observations .",
    "thus , we started a successful programme of hst observations aimed at a solid detection of the candidate s proper motion . in this paper , we report the outcome of this programme : the observations and data reduction are described in section  [ obsdatared ] , the results are discussed in section  [ res ] , while the comparison between optical and radio proper motion values is given in section  [ optvsr ] .",
    "the implications of our measurement are summarized in section  [ concl ] .",
    "the hst observations were performed on january 18th 1996 , see @xcite , and on january 14th 2000 , just after the third refurbishing mission . in both cases , to maximize the angular resolution , the target was centered in the planetary camera ( pc ) , which has a pixel size of 45.5 mas .",
    "the images were taken with the 555w filter ( @xmath11 ; @xmath12 ) .",
    "the pulsar was observed for three orbits in 1996 and for two orbits in 2000 , which correspond to total exposure times of 6200 s and 4400 s , respectively .",
    "the observations were performed with the same telescope roll angle chosen in such a way that the pc x , y axis were oriented along right ascension and declination .",
    "after standard pipeline processing , the images have been cleaned from cosmic ray hits by combining repeated exposures through a median filter . following the standard astrometric approach , e.g. @xcite",
    ", the frames registration has been performed by computing the pixel coordinate transformation between a common set of reference objects identified in the two images and chosen to be neither extended objects nor relatively bright and saturated stars .",
    "the 6 reference objects that satisfy our criteria , together with the pulsar optical counterpart , are identifiable in the january 2000 image shown in fig.1 .",
    "their pixel coordinates have then been computed in the two frames by 2-d gaussian fitting of psf profiles .",
    "the procedure was repeated for different widths of the centering box until the coordinate values were shown to be stable .",
    "finally , the centroids of the reference objects have been determined with an accuracy of @xmath13 px for both epochs .",
    "the coordinates of the psr b0656 + 14 counterpart were computed following the same approach . of course , owing to its lower s / n , its centering error was found slightly higher and more dependent on the size of the centering box . to be conservative ,",
    "we have rounded up the associated error to 0.1 px",
    ". the quoted uncertainties also account for possible centering errors induced by the subtle exposure - to- exposure jitter ( @xmath14 pixels in both frames ) .",
    "all the measured centroids were subsequently corrected for the effects of the pc geometric distorsion @xcite by applying the `` metric '' task of the stsdas package .",
    "the coordinate transformation for the 2000 vs 1996 frame registration was finally computed through a linear fit ( rotation plus offset ) between the second and the first reference grid .",
    "the computed transformation turned out to be accurate to within 0.07 and 0.2 px along the x and y axis , respectively .",
    "we note that the errors on the trasformation , certainly higher than the ones obtained e.g. by the @xcite in the case of the vela pulsar , are independent of the alghoritm used to fit the centroids of the reference stars .",
    "this effect is probably to be ascribed to the much lower number of reference stars used to compute the coordinate transformation as well as to their relative distribution in the frame .",
    "indeed , the error along ra , where the reference stars are distributed on a larger area , is much smaller than the one in dec , where the reference star are much closer to each other ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "having secured a single reference frame , we can compare the relative positions of the pulsar optical counterpart at the two epochs .",
    "the total offset turns out to be @xmath15 px , where the error includes all the uncertainties of the astrometric steps ( exposures alignement , object centering and frame registration ) .",
    "the displacement is obviously very significant and it represents a convincing proof of the object s motion .",
    "after conversion from pixel to sky coordinates , the measured offset translates into an angular displacement of @xmath16 mas over 4 years , corresponding to a proper motion in the plane of the sky of @xmath17 mas / yr . we note that this result can not be improved by using the 1989/1991 images of @xcite , which , although providing a @xmath18 times longer time span , would introduce an error larger than 02 on the corresponding target position , worsening significantly affecting the accuracy on the pulsar displacement .",
    "we note that the measured proper motion turns out to be almost totally in right ascension with the two components @xmath19 mas / yr , @xmath20 mas / yr defining a position angle of @xmath21 . since our wfpc2 observations have been taken virtually on the same day of the year ( january 18 and 14 , respectively ) , we can exclude that the measured displacement is affected by the object parallax , which , for a distance of e.g. 300 pc , would be @xmath22 mas ( almost all in right ascension ) .",
    "thus , the measured displacement is due to a genuine proper motion of the source .",
    "we can now compare our optical proper motion ( @xmath19 mas / yr , @xmath20 mas / yr ) to the revised radio one of @xcite i.e. @xmath6 mas / yr and @xmath23 mas / yr . although certainly compatible within their quoted errors , the optical result appears much more accurate than the radio one .",
    "since both measurements span about 4 years and use a comparable number of reference objects @xcite , the difference in accuracy is ascribable both to systematic errors that , in spite of the strengh of the signal from the radio pulsar , pleague the vla data ( see discussion in pavlov , stringfellow and cordova 1996 ) and to the higher angular resolution of the wfpc2 .",
    "+ on the other hand , the reliability of hst astrometry has been recently assessed by deluca et al .",
    "( 2000b ) through comparing independent couples of wfpc2 observations of the vela and geminga pulsars , which yielded , for each object , fully consistent proper motion measurements .",
    "taking advantage of the outstanding performances of the planetary camera on hst , we have secured a firm measurement of the proper motion of the candidate optical counterpart of psr b0656 + 14 , which moves at a yearly rate of @xmath24 mas . even in the absence of any other supporting evidence ,",
    "the presence of such a proper motion for a 25 mag object , coupled with a distance in the range @xmath25 pc , would imply a transverse velocity anywhere between 50 to 160 km / sec .",
    "such values are typical of just one class of astronomical object : isolated neutron stars .",
    "this was the case of geminga , when the measurement of the proper motion of the optical counterpart @xcite clinched the identification of the faint g  with one of the brightest gamma - ray source in the sky @xcite .",
    "although similar to geminga in many ways , psr b0656 + 14 does not offer such a challenging situation : we face a bona fide radio pulsar , with a radio proper motion and a promising optical counterpart , the identification of which is supported both by multicolor photometry @xcite and timing @xcite .",
    "however , although both methods appear suggestive and definetely worth pursuing , the burden of the proof of psr b0656 + 14 optical identification should rest on a firmer ground .",
    "our highly significant measurement of a proper motion of the optical counterpart provides just such a straighforward evidence .",
