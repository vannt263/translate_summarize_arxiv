    "little is known on the study of morphological instability of the solid - liquid interface when a thin layer of moving fluid separates the developing solid from its surrounding .",
    "for example , the problem of icicle growth involves complex moving boundary problems with phase change .",
    "when an icicle grows , a thin water film from the melting snow and ice at the root of the icicle flows down along its surface and refreezes onto it by releasing latent heat of solidification to the ambient air below 0 @xmath0c . during the icicle growth",
    ", ice does not grow uniformly , but ring - like ripples are often observed on its surface .",
    "@xcite by supplying water continuously from the top of a wooden round stick and of a gutter on an inclined plane set in a cold room below 0 @xmath0c , a ripple pattern similar to that observed on natural icicles is produced on the ice surface .",
    "@xcite surprisingly , the distance between two peaks of ripples experimentally produced as well as that of natural icicles always measures around a centimeter scale .",
    "theoretical works aimed at explaining the underlying dynamic instability that produces ripples are recent .",
    "@xcite a stability analysis for the ice - water interface disturbance was developed based on heat flow in the water and atmosphere , and thin film water flow dynamics . from the initial model",
    ", it was found that the ripple wavelength is determined from @xmath1 , and that the ripples should move down the icicle .",
    "@xcite here @xmath2 is the mean thickness of the water layer , @xmath3 is the p@xmath4clet number , which is a dimensionless number defined as the ratio of the heat transfer due to the water flow to that due to the thermal diffusion in the water layer , and @xmath5 is a dimensionless wave number at which the amplification rate of the ice - water interface disturbance acquires a maximum value . by considering different boundary conditions from those used in the initial model",
    ", a quite different ripple formation mechanism was developed .",
    "@xcite a new formula to determine the wavelength of ripples was derived : @xmath6 , which contains two characteristic lengths @xmath2 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite here @xmath7 is the capillary length associated with the surface tension of the water - air surface . in the new model , the influence of the shape of the water - air surface on the growth condition of the ice - water interface was taken into account .",
    "therefore , another length scale @xmath7 was introduced .",
    "the new model also predicted that ripples should move upward .",
    "the upward ripple translation was already suggested by the observation that many tiny air bubbles were trapped in the upper side of any protruded part of ripples during the icicle growth , and lined up upward .",
    "@xcite however , there was no theoretical explanation for the upward ripple translation mechanism .",
    "both models yield one - centimeter scale wavelength , but the translational direction of the ice ripples is opposite .",
    "recently we solved numerically the same governing equations with the same boundary conditions as those used in the initial model .",
    "however , the numerically obtained amplification rate of the ice - water interface disturbances showed positive values for all wave numbers , @xcite which means that @xmath5 does not exist and there is no mechanism to select a characteristic length . on the other hand , the analytical results for the amplification rate and the translation velocity of ice ripples obtained in the new model were in good agreement with those numerically calculated .",
    "moreover , there was also good agreement between the theoretical predictions of the dependence of ripple wavelength on slope angles of the inclined plane and water supply rates and our experimental results .",
    "finally , upward ripple motion at about half - speed of the mean growth rate of icicle radius was observed experimentally as theoretically predicted , but downward traveling ripples were not observed .",

    "the flowing supercooled water layer , not to scale , is much thinner than the thickness of the thermal boundary layer.,width=453,height=453 ]    in the previous theoretical models , @xcite ice was covered with a supercooled water layer and there was no airflow around icicles .",
    "the latent heat released at the ice - water interface was assumed to be transferred in the air by thermal diffusion through the water layer . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ice - water - air ] ( a ) , for simplicity , a linear air temperature distribution @xmath10 was assumed .",

    "@xcite the water layer of thickness @xmath2 changes by varying the water supply rate .",
    "@xcite however , since @xmath20 does not include @xmath2 , the icicle growth rate does not depend on the water supply rate .",
    "@xcite since @xmath20 contains the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath13 , the ice growth rate is controlled by the rate of latent heat loss from the water - air surface to the surrounding air .",
    "however , it was not possible to estimate the value of @xmath20 because the physical meaning of the assumed distance @xmath13 was unclear .",
    "recently , the growth of icicles has been treated as a free boundary problem to find an ideal growing shape for icicles .",
    "@xcite the latent heat transferred from the icicle surface to the surrounding air through the water layer leads to an increase in air temperature and to a change in density because it is temperature dependent .",
    "if the density decreases with increasing temperature , buoyancy force arises , and warmer air moves up along the ice surface .",
    "this effect is restricted to a thin layer ahead of the water - air surface , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ice - water - air ] ( b ) .",
    "short @xmath21 emphasized the importance of heat transfer through such a convective boundary layer around icicles , and derived a formula for the ice growth velocity normal to the icicle s surface .",
    "the form is the same as @xmath20 mentioned above , but a critical difference is that the length @xmath13 in paper @xcite is the boundary layer thickness .",
    "hence , it was possible to estimate the values of @xmath13 and @xmath20 if the value of an unknown parameter in @xmath13 was given .",
    "@xcite it was also suggested that similarity solutions for the coupled navier - stokes and heat transfer equations in the boussinesq approximation can provide the basis for understanding of the boundary layer .",
    "@xcite in this paper , the value of the unknown parameter in @xmath13 is determined by obtaining the similarity solutions .",
    "since heat transfer can be greatly influenced by the upward natural convection airflow , the question is whether the enhancement of heat transfer due to convection affects the wavelength of ripples on icicles . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that the wavelengths are almost independent of the length of the icicles and the ambient air temperature . in order to clarify these problems , in this paper ,",
    "a linear stability analysis was performed on the ice - water interface disturbance during the ice growth in the presence of a supercooled water film flow and a natural convection airflow .",
    "instead of dealing with the elongated carrot - shaped geometry of the icicle , @xcite ice growth on a flat gutter on an inclined plane of finite length will be considered .",
    "the following theoretical analysis is restricted to two - dimensional vertical cross - sections of the gutter , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ice - water - air ] .",
    "the origin of the @xmath22 axis is the bottom of the gutter and the @xmath8 axis is normal to it .",
    "what is new here is that the effect of a natural convection airflow is being incorporated into the previous theoretical frameworks @xcite with modifications of some of boundary conditions , letting us treat synthetically heat flow in the ice , water and air through a disturbed ice - water interface and water - air surface , as well as thin water film flow and airflow .",

    "the deviation @xmath69 at the ice - water interface caused by the external disturbance does not disappear by thermal diffusion in the water because the thermal relaxation time for the temperature fluctuation with about 1 cm corresponding to ice ripple wavelength is much longer than the time defined by the inverse of the shear rate of water film flow considered here .",

    "although the heat transfer through the air boundary layer is the deciding factor in the growth rate @xmath20 , in order to obtain the growth condition of the ice - water interface disturbance , it is important to determine the perturbed temperature distribution in the water layer as well as that in the air boundary layer .",
    "although the wavelengths theoretically obtained in table [ tab : tablei ] are in agreement with experimental results , @xcite several questions arise for the values of @xmath20 and @xmath9 .",

    "it is known that it is somewhat difficult to grow icicles with significant ripples in the steady calm conditions of icicle formation .",
    "@xcite therefore , instead of assuming a calm environment for ice growth , different heat transfer mechanisms needs to be considered . also , it is necessary to predict or to measure the mean ice growth rate @xmath20 accurately in order to estimate the displacement of ripples .",
    "we have to be careful in the measurement of the displacement of ripples because @xmath129 depends on environmental conditions , as mentioned above .",
    "finally , limitations of the proposed theory must be mentioned .",
    "first , it was assumed that ice was grown in a flat gutter on an inclined plane , considering a perturbation around the flat ice surface .",
    "however , as shown in table [ tab : tablei ] , for a given air temperature @xmath19 , since the ice growth rate @xmath20 depends on @xmath22 , the actual grown ice thickness on the gutter varies locally .",
    "if heat conduction through the ice to the substrate is negligible , the ice thickness @xmath370 in the unperturbed state is proportional to the time .",
    "@xcite the angle that tangent vector to the ice - water interface at @xmath371 makes with respect to the positive @xmath22 direction is given by @xmath372 $ ] .",
    "making use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : v - airflow ] ) , @xmath373 and @xmath374 , @xmath375 gradually changes in time from the initial flat ice surface by @xmath376 = \\cos^{-1}[\\{1+\\{t_{*}/(4x_{*})\\}^{2}\\}^{-1/2}]$ ] .",
    "however , the change is negligible except for small @xmath345 because @xmath377 even after 10 hours in the range of @xmath378 m. the actual geometry of the icicle is that of an elongated carrot shape .",
    "@xcite in this case too , since icicle s surfaces are nearly vertical , we can neglect the change in the slope @xmath379 in @xmath375 except for the tip region .",
    "hence , the use of air boundary layer under the assumption of a flat ice surface is valid , @xcite and the local variation in the thickness @xmath2 and the surface velocity @xmath261 of the water film in the unperturbed state is negligible as ice grows .",
    "however , for ice growth on aircraft wings and aerial cables , the local change in @xmath380 in time is remarkable compared to the icicle growth , so that we have to consider a morphological instability around curved ice surfaces in the unperturbed state , and @xmath2 and @xmath261 are no longer constant over the curved ice surface .",
    "this is relevant to the problems on solidification on surfaces of arbitrary curvature .",
    "@xcite    second , in our linear stability analysis , a small perturbation of the ice - water interface was assumed : @xmath381 $ ] .",
    "however , since the amplitude @xmath382 in @xmath383 and in the corresponding fields increases exponentially with time when @xmath384 , the non - linear terms for the perturbation in the governing equations and boundary conditions are no longer small . even though the linear approximation only describes the initial evolution of the perturbation , there was good agreement between the wavelengths predicted from our linear stability analysis and experimentally observed wavelengths of finite amplitude ripples .",
    "however , it is needless to say that the linear theory is unable to clarify further features related to ripple development , and the question arises of the value of the saturation amplitude , and of how the perturbation amplitude evolves towards this value .",
    "@xcite this leads us to extend the linear perturbation calculation to higher orders in the perturbation amplitude .",
    "@xcite such an amplitude expansion generalizes the time evolution equation of the amplitude of the ice - water interface from @xmath385 to a nonlinear amplitude evolution equation . in order to implement it ,",
    "algebraically complicated calculations are needed .",
    "third , for the relatively weak flow considered here , the free shear stress condition at the water - air surface was still satisfied , and water film flow was driven by gravity only .",
    "however , in the presence of a strong airflow around aircraft wings and aerial cables , the water film flow is driven by gravity and aerodynamic forces .",
    "due to strong air shear stress exerted on the water - sir surface , the distribution of water film flow must be modified from the half - parabolic form @xmath187 to @xmath183 , as discussed in [ sec : linearization ] .",
    "it is known that the aerodynamic forces , as modified by the accreted ice , are significant in determining the wind drag and lift on iced structures .",
    "however , the traditional approach in wet icing modelings has been based on the mass and energy conservations only and have ignored the dynamics of the surface flow of unfrozen water .",
    "@xcite when airflow and water film flow are coupled , the distribution of shear and normal stresses at the water - air surface may influence the temperature distribution in the water layer .",
    "the action of an aerodynamic force on the water - air surface , and the resulting morphological instability of the ice - water interface have to be considered .",
