    "consequently , a spectral energy cutoff can be a probe for the ebl density or source properties ( e.g. bulk lorentz factor ) .",
    "the extension of the observations to higher energies requires a detector with a large effective area .",
    "this can be provided by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) and extensive air shower ( eas ) arrays .",
    "the chances of prompt observations of a grb by iacts are , however , limited by the small duty cycle ( @xmath0 10% ) and restricted field of view ( 5@xmath1 in diameter or less ) .",

    "an energy threshold @xmath3  100 gev can be achieved by placing the array at a high altitude ( closer to the air shower maximum ) .",
    "so far the searches for grbs with eas arrays have not yielded positive detections due to insufficient sensitivity of the existing arrays ( although tentative detections have been claimed by several experiments , e.g. milagrito @xcite ) .",

    "it is assumed that the grb search time window and position on the sky can be set based on observations in other wavelengths ( e.g. by satellites ) . as can be seen , the sensitivity of hawc is comparable to fermi lat s sensitivity above 10 gev , but depends strongly on the redshift ( spectral cutoff ) .",
