    "both string theory as well as brane world cosmology assume that spacetime possesses more than four dimensions .",
    "in string theory , extra dimensions were promoted from an interesting curiosity to a theoretical necessity since superstring theory requires a ten - dimensional spacetime to be consistent from the quantum point of view , while in the brane world cosmology ( which is also consistent with string theory ) the matter and gauge interaction are localized on a 3-brane , embedded into a higher dimensional spacetime and gravity propagates in the whole of spacetime .",
    "this underscores the need to consider gravity in higher dimensions . in this context",

    "this effective action consists of the einstein - hilbert action plus curvature - squared terms and higher powers as well , and in general give rise to fourth order field equations and bring in ghosts .",
    "however , if the effective action contains the higher powers of curvature in particular combinations , then only second order field equations are produced and consequently no ghosts arise @xcite .",

    "so , only terms for which @xmath12 are contributing to the field equations .    in this paper",
    "we want to restrict ourself to the first four terms of lovelock gravity .",
    "the first term is the cosmological term which we ignore it in the investigation of the properties and thermodynamics of the solutions .",
    "the second term is the einstein term , and the third and fourth terms are the second order lovelock ( gauss - bonnet ) and third order lovelock terms respectively . from a geometric point of view , the combination of these terms in seven - dimensional spacetimes , is the most general lagrangian producing second order field equations , as in the four - dimensional gravity which the einstein - hilbert action is the most general lagrangian producing second order field equations . here , we will obtain asymptotically flat solutions of third order lovelock gravity and investigate their thermodynamics .    indeed , it is interesting to explore black holes in generalized gravity theories in order to discover which properties are peculiar to einstein s gravity , and which are robust features of all generally covariant theories of gravity . due to the nonlinearity of the field equations ,",

    "<S> we also perform a stability analysis by computing the determinant of hessian matrix of the mass with respect to its thermodynamic variables in both the canonical and the grand - canonical ensembles , and show that there exists only an intermediate stable phase . </S>"
