    "* ) , the deep near - infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",

    "( _ wise _ , * ? ? ?",
    "proper motions have been measured by combining the _ wise _ astrometry with optical and near - ir catalogs @xcite and by employing only the multiple epochs of data obtained by _ wise _ @xcite . in one of the latter surveys",
    ", @xcite searched for a distant companion to the sun via the large parallactic motion that it would exhibit . during the course of that study",
    ", several hundred new high proper motion objects were found . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the nature of those objects by using photometry and proper motions from 2mass and _ wise _ to identify the ones that are likely to be late type , nearby , or metal poor ( section  [ sec : phot ] ) .",
    "we then use spectroscopy ( section  [ sec : spec ] ) and kinematics ( section  [ sec : kin ] ) to characterize in more detail a subset of that sample , focusing on the most promising candidates for l / t dwarfs and subdwarfs .",
    "@xcite used multi - epoch astrometry from _ wise _ to identify 762 high proper motion objects . for this study , we consider the 761 sources that were detected by 2mass because our analysis relies on both 2mass and _ wise _ photometry .",
    "the one remaining object that is absent from 2mass , wise j085510.83@xmath2071442.5 , has been characterized by @xcite .",
    "we also examine an additional 20 high proper motion objects that are presented in table  [ tab : hipm ] , one of which ( wise j175510.28 + 180320.2 ) has already been reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these objects did not satisfy the criterion of @xmath3/@xmath4 for inclusion in the sample from @xcite , but they did exceed that threshold in an early version of the survey by @xcite that used the preliminary release of data for the post - cryo phase , and at that stage they were confirmed as high proper motion stars using detections from 2mass . although all of these 20 sources appear in 2mass images , some of them lack entries in the 2mass point source catalog , as noted in table  [ tab : hipm ] .    @xcite",
    "have also performed a search for high proper motion objects with data from _ wise _ , arriving at a sample of 3525 sources with motions confirmed by detections in other surveys like 2mass .",
    "they described the overlap between their sample and the one from @xcite and compared the distributions of magnitudes and proper motions between the two samples .",
    "we make one additional comment regarding that comparison .",
    "as illustrated in figure  22 from @xcite , most of the stars that are in @xcite but not in @xcite have motions of @xmath5  yr@xmath6 .",
    "this difference is a reflection of the fact that @xcite excluded _ wise _ sources with 2mass counterparts within @xmath7 , which corresponds to @xmath8  yr@xmath6 , in order to focus on objects with larger motions , particularly those moving fast enough to be companions of the sun ( @xmath9  yr@xmath6 ) .      in @xcite , the 2mass counterpart of wise  j163348.95@xmath2680851.6",
    "was identified as 2mass  j16334908@xmath26808480 . however , upon closer inspection of the images from 2mass , _ wise _ , and the digitized sky survey , we find that the _ wise _ source is a blend of 2mass  j16334908@xmath26808480 and a slightly fainter comoving star , 2mass  j16334976@xmath26808488 . as a result ,",
    "the proper motion reported for this pair by @xcite is incorrect . using the astrometry for the blend from _ wise _ and the mean coordinates of the pair from 2mass , we measure ( @xmath10 cos @xmath11 , @xmath12  yr@xmath6 , @xmath13  yr@xmath6 ) .",
    "the angular separation of the pair is @xmath14 , corresponding to 4050  au for the spectrophotometric distance estimated in section  [ sec : kin ] .",
    "we have attempted to identify additional common proper motion companions in the samples from @xcite and table  [ tab : hipm ] . for each member of those samples , we searched for stars at separations of @xmath15 that have a similar proper motion ( @xmath16  yr@xmath6 ) in a catalog of previously known high proper motion objects that was compiled for the study by @xcite .",
    "the resulting common proper motion pairs are listed in table  [ tab : cpm ] , all of which satisfy the companionship criterion of @xmath17 proposed by @xcite .",
    "the spectral types of the objects in our proper motion sample can be estimated from their 2mass and _ wise _ colors . in figure",
    "[ fig : cc ] , we plot @xmath18 versus @xmath19 and @xmath20 versus @xmath21 for the sample .",
    "the colors are indicative of spectral types ranging from k through mid - t . to illustrate more precisely how the objects are distributed with spectral type , we include in figure  [ fig : cc ] polynomial fits to the mean colors of k dwarfs from simbad and m0t4 dwarfs from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the parameters that define these fits are presented in table  [ tab : fit ] .",
    "we also show the sample of l subdwarfs compiled by @xcite , which are significantly bluer than normal l dwarfs in @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . according to figure  [ fig : cc ] , most of the high proper motion objects are probably m dwarfs .",
    "they are slightly bluer on average in @xmath20 and @xmath21 than the fit to normal m dwarfs , which may indicate subsolar metallicities .",
    "the sample also appears to contain a few dozen l dwarfs and several t dwarfs .    for each object in our sample , we have identified the closest point along the sequence of mean colors of normal dwarfs in @xmath18 versus @xmath19 .",
    "the spectral types that correspond to those points are listed in table  [ tab : rpm ] .",
    "the colors @xmath20 and @xmath21 were excluded from this process because of their degeneracies with spectral type , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : cc ] .",
    "of course , these spectral types estimated from colors should be used primarily for selecting targets of spectroscopy , and should not be treated as true spectral types . because subdwarfs are bluer than normal dwarfs in @xmath18 , their color - derived spectral types will be too early .",
    "nevertheless , cool subdwarfs appear at locations in a diagram in the next section that are distinctive from those of most other high proper motion stars , which facilitates their selection for spectroscopy .",
    "we can estimate the distances of our high proper motion objects with a diagram of @xmath22 versus the color - based spectral types , as shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] . for comparison",
    ", we include a fit to absolute magnitude in @xmath22 , @xmath23 , as a function of spectral type for m6t4 dwarfs from @xcite and a fit to @xmath23 that we have derived for m2m6 dwarfs from simbad .",

    "two objects are above the fit at 10  pc .",
    "the brighter one is wise j104915.57@xmath2531906.1 , which has a parallactic distance of 2.0  pc @xcite .",
    "the other source , wise j163348.95@xmath2680851.6 , appears to be an early l dwarf at @xmath24  pc based on figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "however , it is an unresolved binary in the _ wise _ images ( section  [ sec : cpm ] ) and the color - based spectral type is earlier than the spectroscopic classification of m8+m8.5 ( section  [ sec : spec ] ) , resulting in an underestimate of the distance . in section  [ sec : kin ] , we estimate spectrophotometric distances of @xmath1  pc for the components of this pair .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram in figure  [ fig : cmd ] implies distances of @xmath2510100  pc for the remainder of the sample .    because older stellar populations in the galaxy have higher velocity dispersions and tend to have lower metallicities , metal - poor stars ( subdwarfs ) typically exhibit large values of reduced proper motion , which is defined as @xmath26 @xcite where @xmath27 is a particular photometric band .",
    "diagrams of reduced proper motion versus color or spectral type have been used previously to identify candidates for cool subdwarfs among high proper motion stars @xcite and to characterize the kinematics of known late - type dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we have calculated @xmath28 for the members of our proper motion sample .",
    "the resulting values are presented in table  [ tab : rpm ] and are plotted versus the color - based types in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "we also include in figure  [ fig : cmd ] the known l subdwarfs compiled by @xcite using spectral types estimated from @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the manner applied to our sample . because of their blue colors , the color - based spectral types for these known subdwarfs are earlier than their true types .",
    "one of the l subdwarfs , sdss  j141624.08 + 134826.7 @xcite , has a small value of @xmath28 , but the others reside near the bottom of the reduced proper motion diagram in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , as expected ( two are not plotted because they are below the lower limit ) .",
    "several objects in our proper motion sample also appear in that same area of the diagram , and thus are promising candidates for cool subdwarfs .",
    "we have obtained spectra of a subset of our sample of high proper motion objects to measure their spectral types , focusing on those that appear to have smaller distances , cooler temperatures , or lower metallicities based on the analysis of photometry and proper motions in section  [ sec : phot ] .",
    "we have previously presented optical spectroscopy for the primary in the binary wise j104915.57@xmath2531906.1 @xcite and near - ir spectroscopy for both components @xcite .",
    "that system is included among the objects marked as spectroscopic targets in figures  [ fig : cc ] and [ fig : cmd ] .",

    "the instrument was operated with the 400  l / mm grating in second order , the gg445 filter , and the @xmath29 slit , which produced a wavelength coverage of 54009400    and a resolution of 5   .",
