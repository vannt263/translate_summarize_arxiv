    "the most popular cosmological models such as @xmath0cdm model and a quintessence - cdm model assume that dm and de are distinct entities .",
    "another interpretation of the observational data is that dm / de are different manifestations of a common structure . the first definite model of this type",
    "was proposed a few years ago @xcite , based upon the chaplygin gas , a perfect fluid obeying the equation of state @xmath1 which has been extensively studied for its mathematical properties @xcite . the general class of models , in which a unification of dm and de is achieved through a single entity , is often referred to as _ quartessence _ @xcite .",
    "among other scenarios of unification that have recently been suggested , interesting attempts are based on the so - called _ k - essence _",
    "@xcite , a scalar field with noncanonical kinetic terms which was first introduced as a model for inflation @xcite .",
    "all models that unify dm and de face the problem of nonvanishing sound speed and the well - known jeans instability .",
    "soon after the appearance of @xcite and @xcite , it was pointed out that the perturbative chaplygin gas ( for early work see @xcite , and more recently @xcite ) is incompatible with the observed mass power spectrum @xcite and microwave background @xcite .",
    "essentially , these results are a consequence of a nonvanishing comoving acoustic horizon @xmath2 the perturbations whose comoving size @xmath3 is larger than @xmath4 grow as @xmath5 . as soon as @xmath6 , the perturbations undergo damped oscillations .",
    "for the chaplygin gas we have @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the present day value of the hubble parameter , reaching mpc scales already at redshifts of order 10 .",
    "however , as soon as @xmath9 the linear perturbation theory can not be trusted .",
    "a significant fraction of initial density perturbations collapses in gravitationally bound structure - the condensate and the system evolves into a two - phase structure - a mixture of cdm in the form of condensate and de in the form of uncondensed gas .    the simple chaplygin gas does not exhaust all the possibilities for quartessence .",
    "a particular case of k - essence @xcite is the string - theory inspired tachyon lagrangian @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 it may be shown that every tachyon condensate model can be interpreted as a 3 + 1 brane moving in a 4 + 1 bulk @xcite .",
    "( [ eq001 ] ) is obtained using the stress - energy tensor @xmath12 derived from the lagrangian ( [ eq01 ] ) with @xmath13 replaced by a constant @xmath14 .    in a recent paper @xcite we have developed a fully relativistic version of the spherical model for studying the evolution of density perturbations even into the fully nonlinear regime .",
    "the formalism is similar in spirit to @xcite and applicable to any k - essence model .",
    "the key element is an approximate method for treating the effects of pressure gradients .",
    "here we give a brief description of our method and its application to a unifying model based on the lagrangian ( [ eq01 ] ) with a potential of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a positive integer . in the regime where structure formation takes place , this model effectively behaves as the variable chaplygin gas @xcite with the equation of state ( [ eq001 ] ) in which @xmath17 . as a result , the much smaller acoustic horizon @xmath18 enhances condensate formation by two orders of magnitude over the simple chaplygin gas .",
    "hence this type of model may salvage the quartessence scenario .",
    "a minimally coupled k - essence model @xcite , is described by @xmath19 , \\label{eq4001}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the most general lagrangian , which depends on a single scalar field @xmath21 of dimension @xmath22 , and on the dimensionless quantity @xmath23 defined in ( [ eq1203 ] ) . for @xmath24",
    "the energy momentum tensor obtained from ( [ eq4001 ] ) takes the perfect fluid form , @xmath25 with @xmath26 denoting @xmath27 and 4-velocity @xmath28 the sign of @xmath29 is chosen so @xmath30 is positive .",
    "the associated hydrodynamic quantities are @xmath31 and the speed of sound is defined as @xcite @xmath32 two general conditions @xmath33 and @xmath34 are required for stability @xcite and causality @xcite .",
    "now , using ( [ eq511])-([eq4004 ] ) the @xmath21 field equation can be expressed as @xmath35    since the 4-velocity ( [ eq511 ] ) is derived from a potential , the associated rotation tensor vanishes identically .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation for the velocity congruence combined with einstein s equations and the euler equation assumes a simple form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the shear tensor and @xmath38 is a projector onto the three - space orthogonal to @xmath39 .",
    "the quantity @xmath40 is the local hubble parameter .",
    "defined as @xmath41 .",
    "we thus obtain an evolution equation for @xmath42 sourced by shear , density , pressure and pressure gradient . if @xmath43 , as for dust , eq .",
    "( [ eq008 ] ) and the continuity equation comprise the spherical model @xcite . however , we are not interested in dust , since generally @xmath44 and the right hand side of ( [ eq008 ] ) is not necessarily zero .",
    "in general , the 4-velocity @xmath45 can be decomposed as @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the 4-velocity of fiducial observers at rest , and @xmath48 is spacelike , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in comoving",
    "coordinates @xmath51 .    in spherically symmetric spacetime",
    "it is convenient to write the metric in the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the lapse function , @xmath54 is the local expansion scale , and @xmath55 describes the departure from the flat space for which @xmath56 .",
    "we assume that @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are arbitrary functions of @xmath60 and @xmath61 which are regular and different from zero at @xmath62 .",
    "then , the local hubble parameter and the shear are given by @xmath63 in addition to the spherical symmetry we also require an frw spatially flat asymptotic geometry , i.e. , for @xmath64 we demand @xmath65 where @xmath58 denotes the background expansion scale .",
    "the righthand side of ( [ eq008 ] ) is difficult to treat in full generality . as in @xcite",
    ", we apply the  local approximation \" .",
    "the density contrast @xmath66 is assumed to be of fixed gaussian shape of comoving size @xmath3 with time - dependent amplitude , so that @xmath67 , \\label{eq308}\\ ] ] and the spatial derivatives are evaluated at the origin .",
    "this is in keeping with the spirit of the spherical model , where each region is treated as independent . since @xmath68 at @xmath62 , naturally @xmath69 and @xmath70 at @xmath62",
    "hence , @xmath71 besides , one finds @xmath72 as @xmath73 which follows from einstein s equation @xmath74 .    from now on",
    "we denote by @xmath40 , @xmath75 , and @xmath57 the corresponding functions of @xmath60 and @xmath61 evaluated at @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . according to ( [ eq160 ] )",
    ", the shear scalar @xmath79 vanishes at the origin . evaluating ( [ eq008 ] ) at @xmath62 yields our working approximation to the raychaudhuri equation .",
    "we will now apply our formalism to a particular subclass of k - essence unification models described by ( [ eq01 ] ) .",

    "( [ eq025 ] ) , and eq .  ( [ eq008 ] ) evaluated at @xmath62 determine the evolution of the density contrast .",
    "however , this set of equations is not complete as it must be supplemented by a similar set of equations for the background quantities @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the complete set of equations for @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath21 , @xmath75 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 = 0 , \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq161 ] ) follow from ( [ eq025 ] ) and ( [ eq160 ] ) , respectively , eqs .",
    "( [ eq025 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) are the continuity equations , and eqs .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) are the raychaudhuri equations for the background and the spherical inhomogeneity , respectively .",
    "now we restrict our attention to the potential ( [ eq08 ] ) . in the high density regime",
    "we have @xmath94 , and ( [ eq2 ] ) can be integrated yielding @xmath95 . here",
    "@xmath96 with @xmath97 being the equivalent matter content at high redshift .",
    "hence , @xmath98 , which leads to a suppression of 10@xmath99 of the acoustic horizon at @xmath100 for @xmath101 .    to proceed we require a value for the constant @xmath102 in the potential ( [ eq08 ] ) . as the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the evolution of inhomogeneities we will not pursue the exact fitting of the background evolution .",
    "instead , we estimate @xmath102 as follows .",
    "we integrate ( [ eq2 ] ) approximately with @xmath103 as in a @xmath0cdm universe @xcite and we fix the pressure given by ( [ eq01 ] ) to equal that of @xmath0 at @xmath104 . in this way the naive background in our model reproduces the standard cosmology from decoupling up to the scales of about @xmath105 and fits the cosmology today only approximately ( figure [ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "we solve our differential equations with @xmath58 starting from the initial @xmath106 at decoupling redshift @xmath107 for a particular comoving size @xmath3 .",
    "the initial values for the background are given by @xmath108 and for the initial inhomogeneity we take @xmath109 where @xmath110 represents the effective dark matter fraction and @xmath111 is a variable initial density contrast , chosen arbitrarily for a particular @xmath3 .",
    "# 1    ( # 1 )    in figure [ fig1](b ) the representative case of evolution of two initial perturbations starting from decoupling for @xmath3 = 10 kpc is shown for @xmath112 .",
    "the plots represent two distinct regimes : the growing mode or condensation ( dashed line ) and the damped oscillations ( solid line ) .",
    "in contrast to the linear theory , where for any @xmath3 the acoustic horizon will eventually stop @xmath113 from growing , irrespective of the initial value of the perturbation , here we have for an initial @xmath114 above a certain threshold @xmath115 , @xmath116 at finite @xmath58 , just as in the dust model . thus perturbations with @xmath117",
    "evolve into a _ nonlinear _ gravitational condensate that at low @xmath118 behaves as pressureless super - particles .",
    "conversely , for a sufficiently small @xmath114 , the acoustic horizon can stop @xmath119 from growing .",
    "the crucial question now is what fraction of the tachyon gas goes into condensate .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that if this fraction was sufficiently large , the cmb and the mass power spectrum could be reproduced for the simple chaplygin gas . to answer this question quantitatively ,",
    "we follow the press - schechter procedure @xcite as in @xcite . assuming @xmath120 is given by a gaussian random field with dispersion @xmath121 , the condensate fraction at a scale @xmath3 is given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the threshold shown in figure [ fig2](a ) . in figure [ fig2](a ) we also exhibit the dispersion @xmath124 calculated using the variance of the concordance model @xcite @xmath125 in figure [ fig2](b ) we present @xmath126 for const=7.11@xmath127 , the spectral index @xmath128=1.02 , and the parameterization of bardeen et al .",
    "@xcite for the transfer function @xmath129 with @xmath130=0.04 .",
    "the parameters are fixed by fitting ( [ eq403 ] ) to the 2dfgrs power spectrum data @xcite .",
    "our result demonstrates that the collapse fraction is about 70% for @xmath131 for a wide range of the comoving size @xmath3 and peaks at about 45% for @xmath101 .",
    "# 1    ( # 1 )    albeit encouraging , these preliminary results do not in themselves demonstrate that the tachyon with potential ( 8) constitutes a viable cosmology .",
    "such a step requires the inclusion of baryons and comparison with the full cosmological data .",
    "what has been shown is that it is not correct in an adiabatic model to simply pursue linear perturbations to the original background : the system evolves nonlinearly into a mixed system of gravitational condensate and residual k - essence so that the `` background '' at low @xmath118 is quite different from the initial one . because of this one needs new computational tools for a meaningful confrontation with the data",
    "the tachyon k - essence unification remains to be tested against large - scale structure and cmb observations .",
    "an encouraging feature of the positive power - law potential is that it provides for acceleration as a periodic transient phenomenon @xcite which obviates the de sitter horizon problem @xcite .",
