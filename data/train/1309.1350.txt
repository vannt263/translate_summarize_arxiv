    "it was suggested by wmap that the amplitude of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies has a dipolar directional dependence  @xcite .",
    "this anomalous signature has been recently confirmed by planck  @xcite .",
    "although it is possible that this anisotropy is a foreground effect , it is an interesting question whether or not we can explain this feature consistently within the paradigm of the inflationary universe .",
    "the basic issue is that a dipolar modulation of the amplitude of the curvature perturbation requires a seed dipolar perturbation .",
    "this seed dipolar perturbation itself is known to produce quadrupole and octupole moments of cmb anisotropy , known as the grishchuk - zeldovich ( gz ) effect  @xcite .",
    "various scenarios that explain the dipolar statistical anisotropy have been proposed  @xcite and various features have been investigated  @xcite .",
    "the proposal in ref .",
    "@xcite advocates the use of the super - curvature perturbation  @xcite produced in the open inflation scenario as the seed for the dipolar modulation .",
    "the amplitudes of monopole , dipole , and quadrupole fluctuations @xmath0 @xmath1 caused by the super - curvature mode of a free scalar field in the small mass limit are , respectively , evaluated by taking the small radius limit of the corresponding normalized mode functions as  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the radii of the last scattering surface and the curvature radius in the comoving conformal coordinate , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the mass and the hubble expansion rate in the false vacuum before bubble nucleation .",
    "thus , one can basically avoid the constraint due to the gz effect by choosing @xmath7 to be sufficiently small .",
    "( although in ref .",
    "@xcite a constraint on the amplitude of the super - curvature perturbation was imposed , such a condition on the magnitude of fluctuations beyond the current horizon scale is usually thought to be unnecessary in the context of the inflationary universe .",
    "the quasi - open inflation scenario  @xcite is a typical example . )",
    "however , we suspect that one important constraint has been overlooked . it is a genuine non - linear effect",
    ". if the amplitude of a dipole moment is large , a non - negligible quadrupole moment is naturally induced by non - linearity .",
    "taking into account the constraint from the amplitude of this induced quadrupole moment , we find that almost all models proposed so far are almost excluded by observations . in this letter , we propose a simple alternative scenario that can naturally evade this constraint .",
    "in refs .",
    "@xcite , in order to explain the observed large statistical anisotropy , the simplest curvaton scenario was studied .",
    "the only difference from the ordinary curvaton scenario is that the curvaton has a large - magnitude super - horizon fluctuation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this super - horizon fluctuation was identified with a super - curvature mode , whose amplitude can naturally be large compared with sub - curvature modes if the creation of the one - bubble open universe occurs in the sea of false vacuum whose energy scale is much higher than that inside the bubble . as this generation mechanism of a large super - horizon fluctuation seems most natural , we focus on possible scenarios in this context .",
    "first let us discuss the model based on the simplest curvaton scenario .",
    "we denote the super - curvature fluctuation of the curvaton as @xmath8 .",
    "more precisely , its distribution measured at the current horizon radius is @xmath9 , where the axis of the angular coordinates @xmath10 is aligned to the direction of the dipolar statistical anisotropy .",
    "a typical amplitude of @xmath8 is given by @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ scamp ] ) , whereas @xmath12 represents the ordinary mode fluctuation whose amplitude is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the hubble rate at the time when the relevant length scale crosses the horizon scale during the inflation .",
    "we assume @xmath15 .",
    "the inflation inside the nucleated bubble is driven by an inflaton field @xmath16 , but the details of the model concerning the @xmath16-field are not important at all . for simplicity , we assume that the super - curvature perturbation is completely dominated by the curvaton field @xmath17 and that the inflaton @xmath16 is in the slow - roll regime when the relevant length scale crosses the horizon",
    ".    the observed curvature perturbation can be evaluated by using the @xmath18-formula  ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath19 we assume that the leading - order power spectrum of the curvature perturbation is given by the terms with the first derivatives of @xmath20 , except for extremely low @xmath21 modes like dipole or quadrupole .",
    "then , we have @xmath22    the dipolar statistical anisotropy is caused by the term including @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ deltan ] ) .",
    "the leading term is given by @xmath23 the ratio of these two quantities is constrained by the observation as  @xcite .",
    "we thank m. bucher for making this point clear to us .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion . ]",
    "@xmath24 here we neglected the non - linear terms in the sachs - wolfe relation between @xmath25 and the observed temperature fluctuation @xmath26 since the effect due to this non - linearity is suppressed by @xmath27 and it can be absorbed by the redefinition of @xmath28 .",
    "on the other hand , this model predicts the local - type non - gaussianity , @xmath29 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ statng ] ) in the second and third equalities .",
    "furthermore , a quadrupolar anisotropy is induced by the second - order effect of @xmath8 which originates from the term @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ deltan ] ) .",
    "its magnitude is estimated as @xmath31 we note that this is not the so - called grishchuk - zeldovich ( gz ) effect  @xcite .",
    "we also mention that although the functional dependence of the quadrupole is similar to that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , our estimate gives a more robust bound while that in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on a rather crude argument concerning the convergence of perturbative expansion which can not be directly compared with the observational data . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "if @xmath32 is composed of the super - curvature mode in the open inflation scenario , the constraint from the gz effect can be evaded .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ fnl ] ) and ( [ ampa20 ] ) , we find @xmath33 thus one can not make both the quadrupole and local - type non - gaussianity very small simultaneously .",
    "this gives a bound slightly tighter and more robust than that obtained in eq .",
    "( 59 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we note that the contribution of @xmath34 does not relax the above constraint .    from the observed quadrupole anisotropy , we may bound the induced quadrupole as @xmath35 where the observed magnitude of the squared quadrupole temperature anisotropy is @xmath36 and we inserted a threshold number @xmath37 of order unity .",
    "this implies the constraint @xmath38 which should be satisfied in any kind of model . inserting eq .",
    "( [ ampbeta ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ quadfnl ] ) , we obtain @xmath39 the required value of @xmath40 is already difficult to reconcile with the planck observation ( @xmath41 )  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that this constraint differs from the one discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "if we require the above constraint on the non - gaussianity to be satisfied , we should take @xmath42 .",
    "this implies , from eq .",
    "( [ ampbeta ] ) , that @xmath43 must be accidentally cancelled by the completely independent cmb quadrupole contribution to give the observed small value of @xmath44 .",
    "secondly , the value of @xmath8 must be fine - tuned so that @xmath43 is almost exactly @xmath45 .",
    "thus it is manifest that any models of this kind require extreme fine - tuning .",
    "0 furthermore , when the temperature perturbation is dominated by the curvaton , there should be the dipole temperature perturbation @xmath46 caused by @xmath8 , which means that the peculiar velocity field relative to the cmb rest frame is shifted by the order of @xmath47km / sec .",
    "this will be in conflict with the current observation of the magnitude and the direction of the cmb dipole , which is consistent with the clustering dipoles determined by the distribution of galaxies  @xcite .",
    "we found it difficult to construct a viable model to explain the dipolar statistical anisotropy in the context of simple curvaton models using the non - linear coupling @xmath28 .",
    "one might wonder if using the cross term @xmath48 instead of @xmath28 could improve the situation .",
    "it turns out that this possibility for generating the dipolar statistical anisotropy is also almost ruled out .",
    "this is because one can show that the amplitude of the dipole anisotropy @xmath49 inevitably becomes too large if the dipolar statistical anisotropy is generated by the cross term @xmath48 .    in order to produce the dipolar statistical anisotropy , we must have @xmath50 however , within one expansion time during the inflation , @xmath51 , the average value of the inflaton @xmath16 changes by @xmath52 , where a dot denotes the cosmic time derivative . therefore",
    ", as long as the cross term @xmath48 exists , this shift of the background value of @xmath16 generates @xmath53 , @xmath54 hence the dipole temperature perturbation caused by @xmath8 becomes @xmath55 this constraint is one order of magnitude larger than @xmath56 , which is obtained from the analysis of the doppler boosting by planck  @xcite .",
    "we note that the above argument also applies to a single - field model , in which the role of the @xmath17-field is also played by the inflaton @xmath16 . for this case , @xmath48 and @xmath8 in the above argument",
    "are replaced with @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "consequently , single - field models are also in conflict with observation .",
    "if we introduce the third field , it may be possible to construct models that generate the dipolar statistical anisotropy using the non - linear terms in the @xmath18 formula . however",
    ", as it seems difficult to avoid fine - tuning in such models , we do not pursue this direction further .",
    "the above consideration teaches us that it is not easy to generate the dipolar statistical anisotropy by using cross terms in the expansion of the @xmath18 formula , and simultaneously satisfy the observational constraint that the local - type non - gaussianity is small .",
    "therefore we pursue a different approach .",
    "we consider the possibility of modulating the amplitude of the quantum fluctuations at horizon crossing without affecting the inflationary dynamics .",
    "first we examine a model in which the hubble expansion rate is modulated , but the number of @xmath59-folds @xmath20 is not affected by this modulation .",
    "a model lagrangian is given by @xmath60 here the @xmath61-field is supposed to have a large amplitude of the super - curvature perturbation , but not to affect the inflationary dynamics .",
    "namely , it is assumed that the curvature perturbation is generated by the inflaton @xmath16 .",
    "this means @xmath62 . on the other hand ,",
    "the hubble expansion rate @xmath14 is a function of not only @xmath16 but also @xmath61 , @xmath63 . for @xmath62 ,",
    "this implies @xmath64 . in other words , if we draw contours of @xmath65 on the @xmath66 plane , @xmath14 on the contour of a given value of @xmath20 may depend on @xmath61 .",
    "then the inflaton fluctuation at around @xmath67 , @xmath68 also depends on @xmath61 , where @xmath69 is the value of the @xmath59-folding number at which the comoving scale of the current hubble horizon size left the horizon during inflation .    at first sight , for a potential of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ prodpot ] ) , this model seems viable because the @xmath59-folding number @xmath20 becomes @xmath61-independent , @xmath70 under the slow - roll approximation for @xmath16 , where the subscript @xmath16 denotes the @xmath16-derivative , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the value of @xmath16 at the end of inflation .    unfortunately , however , the above formula for @xmath20 has non - negligible higher - order corrections .",
    "in fact , there always exists a correction of the form @xmath73^\\phi_{\\phi_{\\rm f}}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which depends on @xmath74 .",
    "therefore the curvature perturbation induced by the super - curvature perturbation @xmath75 becomes as large as @xmath76 .",
    "hence this model produces too large an amplitude of the dipole anisotropy @xmath77 , which is already ruled out observationally  @xcite .",
    "finally we propose a viable model . as before",
    ", we assume the existence of a field @xmath61 that carries a super - curvature perturbation @xmath75 .",
    "in addition , we introduce a curvaton @xmath17 .",
    "the idea is to modulate the dynamics of the curvaton @xmath17 by using the @xmath61-field without affecting the inflationary dynamics .",
    "this can be realized by assuming that the kinetic term of @xmath17 depends on @xmath61 .",
    "a model lagrangian takes the form @xmath78 owing to the function @xmath79 , the amplitude of the fluctuations of @xmath17 is modulated as @xmath80 . with an appropriate choice of @xmath79 , this model can easily explain the dipolar statistical anisotropy .",
    "assuming the hierarchy @xmath81 inside the bubble , one can make @xmath61 decay quickly during inflation so that it will not affect the dynamics during or after inflation except for the modulation of the fluctuation amplitude @xmath12 near or beyond the current hubble horizon scale .",
    "we may also assume that the final curvature perturbation is dominated by the curvaton @xmath17 and ignore the fluctuations of the inflaton @xmath16 .",
    "then , we can easily suppress the local - type non - gaussianity .",
    "in this model the origin of the modulation is assumed to die out during the inflation .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of the dipolar statistical anisotropy becomes smaller on smaller length scales .",
    "this seems to be favored by observational data  @xcite .",
