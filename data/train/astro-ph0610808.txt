    "metals observed in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) via quasar absorption line spectroscopy are thought to originate from some form of star formation - driven outflows as dynamical disruption is too inefficient ( aguirre et al .",
    "@xcite ) . when and how metals are injected into the igm are still a matter of debate .",
    "observations of  in the igm show surprisingly little evolution between @xmath6 ( songaila @xcite , schaye et al .",
    "@xcite , & songaila @xcite ) , despite this being the age of peak star formation .",
    "these observations motivate early enrichment scenarios by primeval galaxies and/or populations - iii stars at @xmath2 where physical distances are smaller and the gravitational potential wells are shallower .    in oppenheimer & dav ( @xcite ) ( hereafter od06 ) , we explore a variety of galactic outflow models in gadget-2  cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with the specific emphasis on modeling the  absorption observations between @xmath7 .",
    "we are able to reproduce the main  observations including the relative invariance of @xmath8 ( ) by implementing galactic - scale outflows based on observed local starbursts ( martin @xcite , rupke et al .",
    "@xcite ) . only a narrow range of wind parameters using the physically - motivated momentum - driven wind scenario ( murray , quartet , & thompson @xcite ) are able to enrich the igm without overheating it at early times .",
    "our models favor metal enrichment tied to concurrent star formation , as opposed to an early enrichment scenario with the majority of metals injected into the igm before @xmath9 .",
    "observations supporting this include the ubiquitous outflows seen from star - forming galaxies at high - redshift galaxies ( pettini et al .",
    "@xcite ) and enhanced  and  observed around lyman - break galaxies at @xmath10 ( adelberger et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .    in these proceedings",
    ", we provide further arguments that the majority of metals in the igm can not be injected at very early times . instead , we show the increasing igm metallicity is balanced by an increasing  ionization correction resulting in observations of @xmath8 ( ) that remain relatively invariant from @xmath4 .",
    "we further explore the age of the metals in the igm traced by  absorbers .",
    "we use the n - body+hydrodynamic code gadget-2  ( springel @xcite ) with improvements including metal - line cooling and tunable superwind feedback as described in  2 of od06 .",
    "briefly , the simulations we discuss here use an @xmath11 @xmath12cdm cosmology in a 16 @xmath13 box represented with @xmath14 particles , giving a gas particle resolution of @xmath15 . ",
    "6 of od06 shows that this sufficiently resolves most  absorbers .    for simplicity",
    ", we focus on only two of the six outflow models of od06 , the `` constant wind '' ( cw ) and the `` momentum - driven wind '' ( vzw ) models . the cw model assumes @xmath16 @xmath17 and a mass loading factor @xmath18 , while the vzw model uses the relations @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 being the galaxy velocity dispersion ) .",
    "spectra were generated from the simulations using our software specexbin , which first calculates the physical properties along a line of sight and then applies ionization fractions from cloudy tables of an optically thin slab of gas with an impinging ionizing background field from haardt & madau ( @xcite ) including quasars and star - forming galaxies .",
    "the resulting spectra were analyzed using the autovp package to generate voigt - profile fits from which line statistics could be derived and the summed @xmath8 ( ) was calculated .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] displays the evolution of @xmath8 ( ) for a variety of observations and our cw and vzw models . a comparison to @xmath8(c )",
    "indicates significant ionization corrections , usually in excess of 10 are necessary to derive the true metallicity from @xmath8 ( ) .",
    "the ionization correction increases toward lower redshift for three main reasons .",
    "first and most importantly for the vzw model , the physical densities decrease at lower redshift meaning that  traces metals at higher overdensities , which occupy less volume at lower redshift .",
    "second , the ionization background strengthens between @xmath22 pushing the metals traced by  to slightly higher overdensity .",
    "third , the metals become more shock - heated at later times due to metal - enriched winds colliding with increasingly faster infalling material toward low redshift .",
    "metals are pushed into regions lower overdensity and higher temperature where carbon becomes ionized into  and .",
    "this third effect is greatest for the cw model causing its downturn in @xmath8 ( ) at @xmath23 .    new observations at @xmath24 ( ryan - weber et al .",
    "@xcite , simcoe @xcite ) may suggest even more  at high redshift than our models produce .",
    "the momentum - driven galactic superwind feedback prescription based on observations of local starbursts and star formation rates may not be enough to enrich the high-@xmath25 igm .",
    "we do not rule out the possibility of another form of metal enrichment from the earliest galaxies and stars , although we can not conclude this definitely .",
    "nevertheless , our point is to show that metal enrichment from continual star formation is required to produce most of the observed  by @xmath5 .    as an exercise to show that the majority of metals can not be injected into the igm at early times , we take the metals in our simulation at @xmath5 and put them at @xmath9 densities and ionization conditions .",
    "this assumes that the metals passively evolve since @xmath9 without any new metals being injected .",
    "we also allow the igm to cool to the @xmath9 igm equation of state ( eos ) at @xmath26 , thus assuming that the metals were injected early enough to allow the igm to cool .",
    "slices of absorption in figure [ fig2 ] show how this case ( middle ) would result in much more absorption than the original @xmath9 or @xmath5 vzw case ( left & right respectively ) .",
    "the lower ionization corrections at @xmath9 result in 4@xmath27 more absorption leading to a predicted drop in @xmath8 ( ) of at least 2@xmath27 .",
    "even if we leave the metals at the @xmath5 shocked temperatures , there is still a significant decline .",
    "the fact that a constant @xmath8 ( ) is observed is strong evidence that metals in the igm must be continually injected during the age of peak star formation .",
    "slice of the vzw model ( 15 @xmath13 across ) .",
    "the left and right panels show the metals at @xmath9 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the middle panel represents the early enrichment scenario where the metals in our simulation at @xmath5 are placed at @xmath9 , thus assuming metals passively evolve from @xmath4 .",
    "the  ionization correction is much lower at @xmath9 resulting in @xmath28 more absorption at @xmath9 and an @xmath8 ( ) that must decline by a factor of at least two from @xmath22 , which is not observed .",
    "we can therefore rule out that the majority of metals were injected into the igm before @xmath9 . ]    finally , we explore the age of the typical  absorber at @xmath5 .",
    "we track the histories of individual sph particles in our hydrodynamical simulation to see the redshift of their last injection into the igm .",
    "figure 3 plots the redshift histogram of a ) the metal production ( proportional to the global star formation rate ) , b ) the last injection into the igm of those metals , and c ) the same as ( b ) but for metals traced by .",
    "although @xmath2940% of the gaseous metals are in galactic / halo gas , only 15% of  absorption in spectra comes from this gas leaving the other 85% arising from the igm .",
    "the median age of a  absorber ( ie .",
    "the last time it was in a wind ) is 1 gyr at @xmath5 .",
    "traces metals injected at a variety of ages , and does not exclusively trace metals from very recent star formation nor metals from early enrichment .",
    "the average particle is injected into the igm via a wind more than twice by @xmath5 , indicating there is significant recycling of metals in and out of the igm .",
    "older metals lie in lower overdensities suggesting observations that indicate  resides at a variety of overdensities ( ie .",
    "the pixel optical depth method ) require that metals be injected into the igm at a variety of redshifts .",
    "our cosmological hydrodynamic simulations using momentum - driven winds from star - forming galaxies fit the main  observables between @xmath7 as described in od06 .",
    "we further emphasize : +   + @xmath30 the @xmath8 ( ) measurement remains relatively invariant after @xmath9 despite a vast majority ( @xmath3190% ) of the igm becoming enriched between @xmath4 .",
    "the ionization correction of  decreases due to 1 ) decreasing physical densities , 2 ) increasing ionization background strength , and 3 ) metals becoming more shock - heated at lower redshift .",
    "+   + @xmath30 we disfavor an early enrichment - only scenario , because it would lead to a decreasing @xmath8 ( ) with time due to the increasing  ionization correction . the igm is primarily enriched via continual outflows from star - forming galaxies , although a different form of metal enrichment from the first stars / galaxies may be required for the @xmath24  observations .",
    "+   + @xmath30  traces metals injected into the igm at a variety of ages , with the median age of 1 gyr at @xmath5 .",
    "only 15% of  arises from galactic / halo gas , while the other 85% is from the igm .",
    "the spread of ages of igm metals may be necessary to enrich the variety of overdensities as indicated by observations .",
