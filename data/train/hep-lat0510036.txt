    "the recent interest in pentaquark baryons has been inspired by the experimental discovery of @xmath0 whose quark composition is @xmath1 .",
    "we will not address the experimental situation .",
    "it is summarized by t. nakano in his plenary talk during this conference  @xcite .    in the past few years",
    ", there has been quite an effort to calculate these pentaquark states to see if they can be observed in lattice qcd calculations and if their masses and other properties agree with those observed experimentally . in particular",
    ", it would be interesting to see if there is a way to understand why the observed width of @xmath0 is much narrower than those of the ordinary baryons which are of the order of several hundred mev .    somewhat similar to the experimental situation , among the dozen or so lattice calculations ,",
    "5 calculations  @xcite claim to have positive signals for the pentaquark ; while 7 calculations  @xcite reported null results .",
    "prior to pentaquarks , lattice calculations dwell mostly on stable particles in strong decays , such as the nucleon , the pion , and kaon .",
    "since the quark mass in the present lattice calculations is still not light enough , the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are also below the decay thresholds and can be calculated as the ground states .",
    "come pentaquark , the interpolation field involves two @xmath5 quarks , two @xmath6 quarks , and one strange antiquark which inevitably will couple to the @xmath7 scattering states in addition to the potential pentaquark state .",
    "this presents a challenge not confronted before and , presumably , posted some confusion in the first round of lattice calculations .",
    "we shall address some of the issues due to this complication , namely the questions of interpolation fields , the issue of @xmath7 scattering states , the importance of chiral symmetry , and the contamination of ghost states - a quenched artifact and will attempt to draw some lessons from these calculations .",
    "there has been quite a lot of discussion in the literature on the choice of interpolation fields .",
    "the most naive one is the product of nucleon and kaon interpolation fields , i.e. @xmath8 , \\label{op1}\\ ] ] where the @xmath9 combination is for @xmath10 and @xmath11 and has been denoted as such .. another one is similar , except with the color indices @xmath12 and @xmath13 positioned differently @xmath14 , \\label{op2}\\ ] ] the third one which has been used in the lattice pentaquark calculation is @xmath15 with @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "it is motivated by the diquark - diquark - antiquark picture of jaffe and wilczek  @xcite .",
    "the masses and spectral weights due to an interpolation field operator @xmath17 can be extracted from the zero - momentum correlation function with a point source , which is a sum of exponentials for the spectrum of states with the quantum numbers of the operator @xmath17 @xmath18 it is often asserted in the literature that @xmath19 , being the @xmath7 interpolation field , will couple to the @xmath7 scattering states stronger than do @xmath20 and @xmath21 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath21 is expected to couple weakly to @xmath7 states and more strongly to the pentaquark state .",
    "however , it has been learned in the lattice community over the years not to be overly sanguine about predicting the structure of the hadron based on the interpolation field .",
    "it is already shown in ref .  [ 4 ] that @xmath22 , and @xmath21 are linearly related through the multiplication of @xmath23 and a fiertz transform between the u and @xmath24 fields , i.e. @xmath25 thus they are expected to couple to the same states ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) with comparable spectral weights .",
    "ground states from the @xmath28 and the @xmath7 open jaw diagram as a function of time separation . , width=377,height=226 ]     ( left panel ) and @xmath27 ( right panel ) ground states from the @xmath29 and @xmath21 interpolation fields.,title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=151 ]   ( left panel ) and @xmath27 ( right panel ) ground states from the @xmath29 and @xmath21 interpolation fields.,title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=151 ]    as a further check , we show in fig .",
    "1 the effective mass plot of the ground states as obtained with the three operators in the @xmath26 channel for the @xmath30 quark mass corresponding to a pion mass at 633 mev and the strange mass corresponding to the physical @xmath4 mass on a @xmath31 lattice with overlap fermions and a lattice spacing at @xmath32 fm  @xcite . we see that at short time separation , i.e. @xmath33 , the three interpolation fields do not give the same mass .",
    "only when @xmath34 do they come down to the @xmath7 threshold . whereas the ` open - jaw diagram ' , where the kaon and nucleon are separately projected to the zero momentum states , has better overlap with the threshold @xmath35 scattering state and come down to the threshold much earlier .",
    "this shows that the three interpolation fields project to the same ground state at large time separation .",
    "we also plot their ground state spectral weights in the @xmath26 and the @xmath27 channels in fig .",
    "we see that the spectral weight of @xmath21 is somewhat smaller than those of @xmath19 and @xmath36 in the @xmath26 channel ( @xmath7 in s - wave ) , but not orders of magnitude smaller ; whereas , all three give the same weights in the @xmath27 channel ( @xmath7 in p - wave ) . a single channel approach with enough time separation",
    "will be able to determine the ground state reliably .",
    "but if the pentaquark state is close to the @xmath7 scattering state , as is considered in several calculations as a possbility in the @xmath26 channel , variational approach with multiple interpolation fields is a more effective approach . as a rule of thumb",
    ", the highest state will always be contaminated by still higher states and , thus , can not be trusted .",
    "it is with the multi - operator variational calculations  @xcite that one realizes that the earlier signal  @xcite of a low - lying @xmath26 state in addition to the @xmath7 state at the threshold is spurious and is due to the fact that there were only two operators in the variational calculation .",
    "it is also widely speculated that the diqaurk - diqaurk - antiquark interpolation field proposed by jaffe and wilczek  @xcite @xmath37 will have a better overlap with the pentaquark state to reflect the structure of the pentaquark .",
    "we note that this operator is very similar to the operator @xmath38 @xmath39 the only difference is that there is a covariant derivative between the two diquarks in @xmath40 , while @xmath38 has a @xmath41 between @xmath42 and @xmath6 in one of the @xmath43 diquark pair .",
    "it turns out the pentaquark correlation functions built from these two interpolation fields are linearly related . to see this",
    ", we consider the part of the correlator where the @xmath44 and @xmath41 operate on the d quark propagator to the right which can be written in terms of the eigenstates of the dirac operator , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "now , the @xmath46 and @xmath41 operating on each eigenstate give @xmath47 the upper component of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , i. e. @xmath50 and @xmath51 are related through the dirac eigenvalue equation @xmath52 the lower components are similarly related .",
    "thus , as far as the role of the interpolation fields is concerned and barring special exceptions , one would expect @xmath40 to be equivalent to @xmath38 which is in term equivalent to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "there is no reason why one operator will preferentially project to a particular state , be it the pentaquark or the @xmath7 scattering state .",
    "we should remark that the derivative operator @xmath40 is motivated by the nonrelativistic picture and projects to the upper component of the dirac eigenstates in the @xmath27 channel ; whereas , @xmath53 , and @xmath21 utilize the lower components . for a large quark mass , @xmath54 is approximately equal to @xmath55 from eq .",
    "( [ dic ] ) . in this case , the correlation function due to a local operator is @xmath56 smaller than that of the derivative operator .",
    "this is the reason that the derivative operators are usually used to calculate the orbitally excited states in heavy quarkonia . to illustrate this point , we plot in fig .",
    "3 the spectral weight of the @xmath57 which is obtained from the lower component of the nucleon correlation function with the @xmath58 projection to the negative parity state  @xcite .",
    "we see that the spectral weight does go down like @xmath59 in the range of pion mass from 250 mev to 350 mev .",
    "thus , for heavy quarks , it is better to use the derivative operator as the interpolation field and obtain the negative - parity @xmath57 state from the upper component of the @xmath57 correlator . for small quark masses , the lower component of the nucleon correlator works for the @xmath57 state just as well .",
    "we believe the same is true with the pentaquark calculations .",
    "one shold be able to reach the same five - quark states with the derivative operator , the @xmath21 operator , or equivalently the @xmath19 or @xmath20 operators with comparable spectral weights when the quark masses are close to their physical values .     and the @xmath60 ghost state as a function of @xmath61 . ,",
    "since the 5-quark interpolation field will , in general , project to both the one - particle pentaquark states and the two - particle @xmath7 scattering states on the lattice , one needs to devise a way to distinguish them . to this end",
    ", it was advocated to study the volume dependence of the spectral weights  @xcite .",
    "if it is a one particle state , the spectral weight for the correlator constructed with point source and zero momentum point sink has essentially no volume dependence . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is a two - particle scattering state with relatively weak interaction , it is inversely proportional to the 3 volume from the normalization factor .",
    "the detailed study of such volume dependence with overlap fermions by comparing results from the @xmath31 and @xmath62 lattices with pion mass @xmath63 as low as 180 mev revealed that the ground states of both the @xmath26 and @xmath27 channels are scattering states  @xcite .",
    "one needs to be careful here in view of the fact that it is more subtle to obtain the spectral weight than the mass of a state .",
    "the former is more sensitive to the fitting procedure and the length of time separation in the correlator . as it is shown recently that only when the time separation is large enough ( @xmath64 fm ) and with accurate data is the volume scaling of the spectral weight for the @xmath65 scattering state verified  @xcite . in the @xmath7-pentaquark system that we are concerned with",
    ", the ground state mass is quite high compared to that of one hadron .",
    "furthermore , the excited states of the system , which are the discrete @xmath7 scattering states with @xmath66 and @xmath67 each with discrete lattice momentum in units of @xmath68 , are stacked up more compact than the radial excitation in the one hadron case when the lattice size is reasonably large ( e. g. more than @xmath69 fm ) . both of these factors require a large time separation or a more sophisticated fitting routine , such as fitting with bayesian priors  @xcite or with a variational approach , in order to obtain the spectral weights reliably  @xcite . the study of @xmath65 in ref .",
    "[ 14 ] serves as a caveat for the authors earlier work on pentaquark where they found the volume dependence of the spectral weight behaves like that of a one - particle state  @xcite .",
    "another calculation  @xcite , which observes little volume dependence of the spectral weight for the first excited state in the @xmath26 channel , employed variational method with two operators and used two exponentials to fit the spectral weights . as is widely known in fitting procedures",
    ", one can not trust the results of the highest fitted state which is the second state in this case . as we pointed out in sec .",
    "[ if ] , the lesson learned from the variational calculations with multi - operators  @xcite vs two operators  @xcite should be taken to heart .",
    "as such , the results of this study  @xcite should be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "another way of distinguishing a scattering state from a pentaquark state is the clever idea of adopting the ` hybrid boundary condition '  @xcite with the anti - periodic spatial boundary condition for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks and periodic condition for the strange quark .",
    "this way , the energies of the @xmath7 scattering states will be raised compared to those from the usual periodic boundary condition ; while those of the @xmath1 pentaquarks will stay the same  @xcite . using this technique ,",
    "it is found that the state near the @xmath7 threshold in the @xmath26 channel is a scattering state .",
    "the third way to tell @xmath7 scattering state and pentaquark state apart is to examine the volume dependence of the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the one - particle state is not expected to be sensitive to the lattice volume when it is large enough for the specific quark mass ; whereas , a weakly interacting two - particle state with relative momentum @xmath70 will have a volume dependence since @xmath70 is in units of @xmath68 .",
    "this approach applies well to our study since the @xmath7 interaction is weak and , as a result , it does not distort the discrete @xmath7 spectrum much from the non - interacting one .",
    "but it requires high statistics in order to discern the volume dependence which is milder compared to the @xmath71 scaling of the spectral weight .",
    "it is learned from studying the quenched chiral logs in @xmath72  @xcite , and the meson cloud effect in roper resonance and @xmath73  @xcite that chiral dynamics begins to play an important role in baryons when the pion mass is lower than @xmath74 mev which characterizes the chiral regime .",
    "it is logically possible that the pentaquark state exists only for very light quark masses .",
    "after all , the first prediction of the anti - decuplet pentaquark is based on the chiral skyrme model  @xcite . since most of the lattice calculations are carried out outside this chiral regime , the conclusion drawn from these calculations may not be relevant in this case . to have a definite answer on the existence of the pentaquark will require calculations in the chiral regime with dynamical fermions .",
    "when in the chiral regime , one needs to be concerned with the presence of ghost states for the quenched approximation and the partially quenched case when the sea quark and valence quark masses do not match .",
    "the relevant ghost state in our case is @xmath75 with the would be @xmath76 loop not fully developed to that of a physical @xmath76 . instead , it has a double @xmath77 pole which has the pion mass and breaks unitarity by giving a negative contribution to the 5-quark correlator .",
    "the ghost state is a practical problem in the @xmath27 channel in the chiral regime where the @xmath78 and @xmath76 can be in relative s - wave which becomes lower than the p - wave @xmath7 state at certain mass and gives rise to a negative correlator  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the ghost state and the physical states have to be fitted together before drawing any conclusion  @xcite .",
    "after the @xmath75 ghost state is removed , it is found that the lowest physical state is the @xmath7 p - wave scattering state in the @xmath27 channel  @xcite .",
    "there is only one lattice calculation which claims to have detected a pentaquark in the @xmath27 channel  @xcite .",
    "when extrapolated to the chiral limit , it approaches the @xmath7 threshold .",
    "this contradicts the findings in all the other calculations .",
    "we speculate that this could be due to the contamination of the @xmath75 ghost state . even though the quark masses are somewhat higher than the chiral regime , the fact that the spatial volume is small in this study ( @xmath79 fm ) makes it more susceptible to the negative contribution from the the three - particle @xmath75 ghost state which scales like @xmath80 .",
    "since the would be @xmath76 has the same mass as the pion , the ghost state is expected to reach the @xmath7 threshold at the chiral limit .",
    "another noticeable feature of the calculation is that the overlap fermion results are found to be higher than those of the wilson fermion for @xmath63 heavier than @xmath81 mev in the positive parity channel and @xmath82 mev in the negative parity channel  @xcite . in the @xmath27 case",
    ", the mass difference can be as large as @xmath74 mev .",
    "this needs an explanation .",
    "in contrast , ground state masses in the @xmath26 channel from 6 different calculations with both the overlap and wilson fermions are plotted in fig .",
    "28 in ref .",
    "[ 8 ] and they pretty much lay on top of each other in the pion mass range from 420 mev to 890 mev .",
    "to summarize , we have learned several lessons from studying the 5-quark system which includes two - particle scattering states in the spectrum .",
    "first of all , the appearance of the interpolation field does not necessarily betray the structure of the hadron . to learn about the structure of a hadron",
    ", it is better to study the three- and four - point correlation functions .",
    "secondly , it is essential to discern the one- or two - particle nature of the observed state before making a claim of having detected a pentaquark . in order to resolve states close by ,",
    "it is necessary to perform variational calculation with more interpolation fields than the number of states of interest .",
    "lastly , it is necessary to go down to small enough quark masses where the chiral dynamics dominates and get rid of the quenched or partially quenched ghost state in the @xmath27 channel before one can be sure if the pentaquark exists .",
    "after close examination of the existing lattice calculations , we conclude that there is no convincing evidence that any pentaquark state has been observed so far .    of course , `",
    "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence '  @xcite . to finally settle the issue",
    ", one needs to carry out realistic dynamical fermion calculations at physical quark masses , do a variational calculation to study the spectrum and the volume dependence of the spectral weight , and remove the potential ghost states in the partially quenched case .",
