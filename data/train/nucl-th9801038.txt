    "superdeformation at high spin is one of the most interesting topics of the low energy nuclear physics .",
    "the large amount of experimental information , which has become available in recent years for superdeformed ( sd ) rotational bands at various mass regions @xcite , has also attracted much theoretical interest for detailed studies of their structure and properties .",
    "however , there are still very important quantities not yet measured . linking transitions from superdeformed states have been identified only for @xmath1hg @xcite and @xmath1pb @xcite nuclei .",
    "therefore , spins , parities as well as excitation energies of sd bands are not yet known in most of the cases .",
    "a direct test of the structure of the wave functions of the single - nucleonic orbitals ( e.g. via magnetic moments ) is considered extremely difficult due to the very short life - times of the sd high - spin states .",
    "all these make a straightforward comparison between experiment and theory almost impossible in most of the cases .",
    "therefore , the relative properties of different sd bands play an important role in our understanding of their structure ( see for example refs .",
    "one of the main goals is to understand which changes of the single - particle orbitals are involved on going from one sd band to another and how they affect physical observables , like dynamic moments of inertia @xmath2 , charge quadrupole moments @xmath3 etc .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the underlying structure of two sd bands in two neighboring nuclei , differing by the occupation of one single - nucleonic orbital , provides a less model dependent comparison compared with the one among bands which differ in occupation by several nucleonic orbitals .",
    "this is because of possible inadequacies in the theoretical description of the properties of the single - particle orbitals .",
    "there are different ways to identify the underlying orbital , however , all of them are not free of disadvantages .",
    "the most reliable experimental data is obtained from precise measurements of transition energies within the sd bands .",
    "therefore the analysis can be based either on the relative properties of dynamic moments of inertia @xmath2 , or on the effective alignment @xmath4 of two different sd bands . in the present article , these two approaches are discussed and compared in detail .",
    "moreover , the applications of these approaches to the analyses of sd bands within the framework of different models are also overviewed .",
    "relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory has recently gained considerable success in describing various facets of nuclear structure properties @xcite . the cranked relativistic mean field ( crmf ) theory @xcite provides the extension for the description of rotating nuclei .",
    "the crmf theory has been successfully applied for the study of twin bands in rotating sd nuclei @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been also used for a detailed description of the sd bands observed in the @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite regions , where rmf theory provides also an excellent description of the ground state properties @xcite .",
    "it is noted in passing , that rmf theory excellently reproduces the recently reported excitation energies of the sd bands relative to the ground state of @xmath1hg and @xmath7pb nuclei @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that crmf theory provides a good agreement with experiment .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this analysis has been based on the properties of dynamic moment of inertia @xmath2 only @xcite .",
    "so far , the additional information that can be obtained by means of the effective alignment approach for the absolute alignments of the single - particle orbitals and for their changes with increasing rotational frequency , has not been exploited .",
    "such an analysis seems also to be necessary in order to test to which extent crmf theory is able to describe not only collective but also single - particle properties of rotating nuclei .",
    "the present work has two parts . in the first part we study the alignment properties of single - particle orbitals in the superdeformed minimum",
    "this study is based on sd bands observed in the @xmath0 mass region .",
    "there are two reasons that motivate this selection . the first reason is connected with the fact that , as it is rather commonly accepted , many features of the sd bands in this mass region can be well understood in terms of an almost undisturbed single - particle motion @xcite .",
    "this implies that a study without pairing correlations is a reasonable approximation .",
    "therefore , as in our previous investigations for this mass region @xcite , pairing correlations are not taken into account .",
    "the motivation as well as the validity of such an approximation have been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "secondly , the effective alignment approach based on the cranked nilsson - strutinsky ( cn ) model has been extensively used in this mass region @xcite .",
    "this provides the opportunity to make a comparison with the cn approach , in which bulk and single - particle properties are treated separately .",
    "we have carried out a detailed analysis of the alignment properties of some single - particle orbitals involved in the sd bands observed in nuclei in the neighborhood of @xmath8dy and @xmath9eu .",
    "we have limited ourselves to sd bands which do not undergo unpaired band crossing .",
    "one should note , however , that in some cases band crossings may play an important role to identify some orbitals via the characteristic shape of @xmath2 in crossing region and the characteristic crossing frequencies .",
    "this has been illustrated , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the second part of the article we examine the dependence of the calculated observables on the lagrangian parameterizations of the rmf theory .",
    "so far , only the frequently used nl1 force @xcite has been employed in our investigations @xcite and satisfactory results have been obtained .",
    "difficulties have been observed , however , in @xmath10gd isotopes , for a consistent determination of the yrast and first excited sd bands .",
    "nl1 predicts a rather large asymmetry energy in nuclear matter calculations and therefore does not seem to be appropriate for nuclei with large neutron excess @xcite .",
    "we have carried out calculations using the nlsh @xcite parameterization as well as the recently proposed parameter set nl3 @xcite for several rare - earth nuclei .",
    "the results are compared with experiment and those obtained with nl1 .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the main features of the crmf theory are briefly outlined .",
    "details of the calculations are also given . in section 3 the effective alignment approach",
    "is discussed and compared with the one based on dynamic moment of inertia .",
    "applications of the two approaches within the framework of different models are also overviewed . in sections 4 and 5",
    "the results of the crmf theory for nuclei around @xmath8dy and @xmath9eu , respectively , are analyzed using the effective alignment approach . in section 6",
    "the dependence of collective and single - particle properties on the parameterizations of the rmf lagrangian is discussed .",
    "finally , section 7 summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "the starting point of the rmf theory is the well known local lagrangian density @xcite where nucleons are described as dirac spinors which interact via the exchange of several mesons such as the @xmath11-meson responsible for the large scalar attraction at intermediate distances , the @xmath12-meson for the vector repulsion at short distances and the @xmath13-meson for the asymmetry properties of nuclei with large neutron or proton excess .",
    "the local lagrangian density can be written in the following form : @xmath14 where the non - linear self - coupling of the @xmath11-field , which is important for an adequate description of nuclear surface properties and the deformations of finite nuclei , is taken into account according to ref .",
    "the field tensors for the vector mesons and the photon field are : @xmath15 in the present state of the art of rmf theory , the meson and photon fields are treated as classical fields .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eq1 ] ) contains as parameters the masses of the mesons @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the coupling constants @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the non - linear terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the mesons are considered as effective particles carrying the most important quantum numbers and generating the interaction in the corresponding channels in a lorentz invariant manner by a local coupling to the nucleons . in this sense",
    ", the lagrangian ( 1 ) is an effective lagrangian constructed for the mean field approximation .",
    "the rmf theory has been extended for the description of rotating nuclei by employing the cranking model @xcite .",
    "the rotation of a nucleus with the angular velocity ( rotational frequency ) @xmath24 is considered along the @xmath25-axis in a one - dimensional cranking approximation .",
    "the rotational frequency is determined by the condition that the expectation value of the total angular momentum at spin @xmath26 has a definite value : @xmath27 in this concept the rotation of nuclei can be described by transforming the effective lagrangian density ( [ eq1 ] ) from the laboratory system into a frame which rotates with constant angular velocity @xmath24 along the @xmath25-axis .",
    "subsequently , the variational principle leads to time - independent inhomogeneous klein - gordon equations for the mesonic fields in the rotating frame ( for details see ref .",

    "the contribution of space - like components vanish in the systems with time - reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "note that in mean field approximation the contribution of the charged @xmath13-mesons vanish too .",
    "the uncharged components are defined as @xmath36 and @xmath41 .    in the hartree approximation , the stationary dirac equation for the nucleons in the rotating frame",
    "can be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents a repulsive vector potential : @xmath44 and @xmath45 an attractive scalar potential : @xmath46 the latter contributes to the effective mass as : @xmath47 a magnetic potential @xmath48 : @xmath49 originates from the spatial components of the vector mesons .",
    "it breaks the time reversal symmetry and removes the degeneracy between nucleonic states related via this symmetry .",
    "this effect is commonly referred to as * nuclear magnetism * @xcite .",
    "the role of the magnetic potential is quite important for a proper description of the moments of inertia @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present work _ the spatial components of the vector mesons are taken into account in a fully self - consistent way_.    finally the term @xmath50 represents the coriolis field .",
    "it is noted that time - reversal symmetry is also broken by the coriolis field .",
    "the numerical calculations have been performed along the lines presented in section 2.2 of ref .",
    "the experimental data for sd bands is taken from the references given in table 2 shown below .",
    "however , in the present investigation we are mainly interested in the single - particle properties .",
    "this suggests that a more accurate truncation scheme should be used . in view of this , more mesh points ( 16 ) have been used for the gauss - hermite integration to ensure better stability in the final results .",
    "all bosonic states below the energy cut - off @xmath51 and all fermionic states below the energy cut - off @xmath52 have been used in the diagonalization .",
    "the basis deformation @xmath53 has been used for all nuclei considered in this study .",
    "the accuracy of the calculations using this truncation scheme has been tested against the calculations in an extended basis with fermionic and bosonic states up to @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "this extended basis is very stable with respect to changes of its parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we have carried out test calculations using different combinations for @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "specifically , the values @xmath58a@xmath59 mev , @xmath60a@xmath59 mev , @xmath53 and @xmath61 have been used . for the lowest sd configuration of @xmath8dy at @xmath62 mev",
    ", we have found the following maximal variations for several quantities : total energy - 0.02% , total spin - 0.5% , kinematic moment of inertia @xmath63 - 0.5% , charge quadrupole moments @xmath3 - 0.17% , mass hexadecupole moment @xmath64 - 0.11% . in table 3 given below we show some results based on this truncation scheme .",
    "the results obtained with this basis are close to those obtained in ref .",
    "they are typically within the uncertainty range of the truncation scheme used in the previous calculations .",
    "it should be noted , however , that such calculations require enormously large computation time and a systematic study becomes practically impossible .",
    "the comparison with the calculations in an extended basis shows that our truncated basis provides reasonable accuracy and the computation time allows a systematic investigation .",
    "the numerical uncertainty in the calculation of the effective alignments @xmath4 is typically less than @xmath65 dependent on the active orbital .",
    "for example , the numerical uncertainty in the calculation of the effective alignments @xmath4 of the @xmath665/2(r=\\pm i)$ ] orbitals is less than @xmath67 , while for some high-@xmath68 orbitals it is close to the upper limit .",
    "the accuracy in the relative charge quadrupole moments @xmath69 is of about 0.02 @xmath70b .",
    "that is sufficient for drawing meaningful physical conclusions .    in the present work",
    "we have mainly used the non - linear parameter set nl1 @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian parameterizations nl3 and nlsh have been also employed in the second part of our study . in table 1",
    "we list all the parameter sets used in this work .",
    "they have been adjusted in the literature to bulk properties of several spherical nuclei and no information about single - particle properties have been taken into account in their determination . for the coupling of the coulomb field we use the experimental value @xmath71 .",
    "one way to identify the single - particle orbital by which two sd bands differ is to compare the difference of their experimental dynamic moments of inertia @xmath2 with the calculated ones @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the analysis in terms of the dynamic moment of inertia @xmath2 is that , no knowledge of the spin values is required .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the @xmath2 values are calculated either from the second derivative of the total energy as a function of the spin : @xmath72 or using a finite difference approximation for eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) : @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the energies of the @xmath75-transitions within a band .",
    "this implies that such a comparison is very sensitive to the accuracy with which @xmath2 is described within a certain model",
    ". a more important disadvantage of the method based on @xmath2 is that the orbitals with nearly constant alignment , as a function of rotational frequency ( or spin ) , should have only a small impact on @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , the fractional change @xmath76 in @xmath2 of two bands @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( the criterion most frequently used for selection of identical bands ) is @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the relative alignment of the two bands , i.e. the difference between their spins at constant @xmath81 : @xmath82 equations ( [ fc ] ) and ( [ alig ] ) suggest that two bands with constant ( or nearly constant ) relative alignment as a function of the rotational frequency ( or spin ) should have the same ( or very similar ) dynamic moments of inertia . in sd bands of the @xmath0 mass region ,",
    "many of the @xmath83 non - intruder orbitals , sitting close to the fermi level , have this property .",
    "the rather general uncertainties connected with the single - particle ordering in the sd minimum prevent a unique definition of the underlying configuration in terms of non - intruder orbitals , if the approach is based only on properties of @xmath2 . a large difference in the dynamic moments of inertia @xmath2 of two bands",
    "is expected if only the relative alignment of the two bands has large variations as a function of the rotational frequency ( or spin ) .",
    "this is usually the case when two bands differ by a particle in the high-@xmath68 intruder orbital ( @xmath84 for @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "the density of these orbitals in the vicinity of the fermi level is rather small , thus the identification of the high @xmath68-orbital , by which two bands differ , is expected to be rather realistic @xcite .",
    "however , even in this case , such an analysis does not reveal how well theory is able to describe the relative alignment of two bands because the difference in @xmath2 s of the two bands is not sensitive to the absolute value of the relative alignment .    an alternative way to analyze the contributions coming from specific orbitals and thus to identify the configuration ,",
    "is the effective alignment approach suggested by i.ragnarsson in ref . @xcite and widely used within the cn model for the analysis of the structure of sd bands observed in the @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath85 mass regions @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been also used for the description of relative properties of smooth terminating bands observed in the @xmath86 mass region @xcite .",
    "the effective alignment is defined as @xmath87 and the notation simply reflects the fact that the spins of the bands under consideration are not experimentally determined .",
    "experimentally , it includes both the alignment of the single - particle orbital and the effects associated with changes in deformation , pairing etc . between the two bands .",
    "this approach exploits the fact that the spin is quantized , integer for even nuclei and half - integer for odd nuclei .",
    "in addition it is constrained by the signature .",
    "its advantage is that it allows us to study the absolute value of the relative alignment of two bands , providing additional information about alignment properties of the single - particle orbitals by which two band differ .",
    "it should be noted that this method is not free from some deficiencies .",
    "it requires the knowledge of the absolute spin values of the sd bands , which , however , are not experimentally known .",
    "therefore , some spin value is usually assumed for one band , typically for the yrast band of a doubly - magic nucleus , based on model arguments ( e.g. comparison between calculated and experimental kinematic moments of inertia ) or on some experimental estimates .",
    "then the effective alignment approach is used to establish the relative spins with respect to this `` reference '' band for sd bands in neighboring nuclei .",
    "the ability to establish the relative spins is the clear advantage of the effective alignment approach compared with the method based on @xmath2 .",
    "one should note that , once the configurations and specifically the signatures are fixed , the relative spins can only be changed in steps of @xmath88 ( n is integer number ) providing thus a reasonable estimate for these quantities , based on a comparison between theory and experiment . only in the case of signature degenerated bands , the relative spins can be changed in steps of @xmath89 .",
    "there are two constraints for the absolute values of @xmath4 : a ) at large deformation most of the single - particle orbitals have similar @xmath90 values ( usually , in the range @xmath91 ) , and the deviation comes only from the intruder orbitals @xcite , b ) most of the signature degenerated orbitals should have @xmath90 in the range @xmath92 because in most cases large @xmath90 values imply large signature splitting between signature partner orbitals . in such a way it is possible to map the relative spins for a large number of sd bands in the whole region .",
    "this has been done , for example , in the framework of the cn model @xcite for the @xmath93 mass region .",
    "it should be also taken into consideration that there are cases where several orbitals close to the fermi level have similar effective alignments .",
    "there is no unique way to distinguish them .",
    "this is overcome , in some cases , exploiting specific experimental features which allow us to distinguish amongst several possibilities .",
    "for example , accidental degeneracy in the excitation energy of two states in bands 2 and 4 of @xmath94gd indicates that these bands have the same parity and signature @xcite . without this observation ,",
    "two orbitals namely , @xmath955/2 $ ] and @xmath969/2 $ ] , having rather similar alignment properties , could be considered equally possible candidates for the signature degenerated bands with @xmath97 observed in nuclei around @xmath8dy . in the existing interpretation band 2 in @xmath94gd",
    "has positive parity .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath985/2(r=\\pm i)$ ] orbitals should be occupied in such bands @xcite .",
    "the effective alignment approach is not free from uncertainties related to the single - particle energies in the sd minimum .",
    "however , different theoretical approaches ( cn , cranked wood - saxon ( cws ) , cranked hartree - fock ( chf ) with skyrme forces and crmf ) indicate the same group of specific orbitals lying in the vicinity of the sd shell gaps .",
    "therefore , one expects to be able to specify the most probable orbitals which are occupied or emptied in the sd bands with the help of the effective alignment approach .",
    "further test may be done using the different deformation dependence of single - particle orbitals by considering a large group of sd nuclei with different equilibrium deformations .",
    "precise measurements of charge quadrupole moments could provide additional information for the involved single - particle orbitals .",
    "however , an analysis based on this physical quantity should be considered complementary because of the relatively large experimental error - bars .",
    "in addition , sd bands with different structure could have similar charge quadrupole moments .",
    "recent investigations of the additivity of the quadrupole moments , performed using the chf approach with skyrme forces @xcite and the cn model @xcite for the @xmath99 mass region , have shown that the relative quadrupole moments between two different sd bands can be written as the sum of the independent contributions of the single - particle / hole states around the doubly magic sd core of @xmath8dy .",
    "a similar principle of the additivity for effective alignments has been discussed long ago in ref .",
    "however , only a restricted number of sd bands in the @xmath10gd nuclei have been considered , which indeed show that the experimental effective alignments follow a simple rule of additivity @xcite .",
    "one should note that a detailed theoretical investigation of the additivity of the effective alignments is lacking till now .",
    "similarly to the case of the quadrupole moments , the problem can be formulated in the following way : whether the effective alignments @xmath100 between configurations a and b , calculated at their self - consistent deformations , can be written as a sum of independent effective alignments @xmath4 calculated from the single - particle / hole orbitals ( by which configurations a and b differ ) around the doubly magic sd core of @xmath8dy : @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( [ addit ] ) , the sum runs over the orbitals by which the configurations a and b differ .",
    "we do not aim to perform a detailed investigation for the additivity of the effective alignments considering that similarly to the case of quadrupole moments @xcite it should involve the calculations of a considerable number of sd bands . on the other hand ,",
    "general features related to the additivity of the effective alignments can be understood by considering some extreme cases . in order to see to which extend the additivity of the effective alignments",
    "is fulfilled we introduce the quantity @xmath102 defined as @xmath103 the results of the calculations for @xmath102 are shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the extreme case which involves the @xmath665/2(r=\\pm i)$ ] orbitals with an effective alignment close to @xmath104 , ( see fig . 3 below ) the additivity of the effective alignments is fulfilled with rather high accuracy . on the other hand , in other two extreme cases which involve the @xmath105(r =- i)$ ] and the @xmath1063/2(r=\\pm i)$ ] orbitals with very pronounced rotational frequency dependence of the effective alignments ( see figs . 2 , 3 and 10 below )",
    "the additivity of the effective alignments is broken .",
    "the origin of this feature is connected with the fact that the alignment properties of these single - particle orbitals are strongly depended on the deformation ( see for example fig . 2 and table 4 ) .",
    "in comparison , the effective alignments of the @xmath665/2(r=\\pm i)$ ] orbitals do not show a considerable dependence on the deformation ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . note also that in both cases we have compared configurations with rather large differences in the self - consistent deformations .",
    "this suggests core polarization effects .",
    "these results indicate that the effective alignments follow with reasonable accuracy the rules of additivity only in cases where the difference between the compared configurations is connected with the occupation of orbitals having alignments varying only weakly with rotational frequency and deformation . in the sd minimum , these are typically non - intruder orbitals . as a result ,",
    "considerable deviations of the experimental effective alignments , connected with such orbitals , from the additivity rules of eq .",
    "( [ addit ] ) could be considered as a fingerprint of residual interactions not accounted in a pure single - particle picture .",
    "note , that even in this case it is reasonable to expect that deviations from the additivity rules will increase with an increasing number of orbitals , by which the compared configurations differ . on the other side",
    "it is clear that the effective alignments of high-@xmath68 intruder orbitals are less additive than the effective alignments of non - intruder orbitals .",
    "this is connected with the fact that the angular momentum alignments of these orbitals have a pronounced rotational frequency and deformation dependence .",
    "in addition , their occupation typically has considerable impact on the self - consistent deformation .",
    "the present paper is the first work where crmf theory is used to describe sd bands within the effective alignment approach .",
    "most of the theoretical studies of sd bands have employed the approach based on @xmath2 , although the effective alignments of different sd bands could provide an additional test on the validity of the models .",
    "as discussed above the effective alignment approach has been widely used only within the cn model . in the framework of the cws approach ,",
    "there is only one study for the sd bands of @xmath107sr nuclei @xcite , where shape polarization effects are taken into account .",
    "finally , within the microscopic non - relativistic effective theories there is also only one study on the market . the effective alignment associated with the @xmath1081/2",
    "$ ] orbital has been studied within the chf approach using various skyrme forces ( siii , skm@xmath109 and skp ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown that it was more difficult to reproduce the relative alignments of the pairs of bands than the identity of the dynamic moments of inertia .",
    "the authors suggested that a readjustment of the parameters of effective forces in the time - odd channel seems to be necessary for a better description of the relative alignments of different bands .",
    "our starting point is the lowest sd configuration , namely @xmath110 , of the doubly magic nucleus @xmath8dy .",
    "theoretical approaches within different models agree that this configuration is indeed the lowest one @xcite .",
    "the magic character of @xmath8dy is consistent with the measured intensities of the excited sd bands , which are smaller than the corresponding ones in all neighboring nuclei @xcite .",
    "adding particles or holes to this configuration , one can study the single - particle orbitals which are available in the vicinity of the @xmath111 and @xmath112 sd shell gaps by means of the effective alignment approach @xcite .",
    "we report and discuss our results separately for each active orbital .",
    "we restrict ourselves mainly to configurations calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "linking transitions from sd to normal - deformed ( or spherical ) states of dy , tb and gd nuclei have not yet been observed .",
    "therefore , no direct information about the absolute spin values of the sd bands is available . for some sd bands ,",
    "however , there are experimental estimates of their values with typical uncertainty @xmath113 @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", we have selected the spin of the lowest observed state in band 1 of @xmath8dy to be @xmath114 .",
    "it corresponds to the @xmath75-transition @xmath115 with energy 602.4 kev .",
    "the reason for this choice is that the spins , which have been assigned to the sd bands in the dy , tb and gd nuclei using the effective alignment approach ( see table 2 ) , should be , on the average , within the uncertainties of the available experimental estimates @xcite .",

    "the dynamic moment of inertia @xmath2 of band 1 shows a large peak at @xmath272 mev , ( see fig . 19 in ref .",
    "the interpretation provided in ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that it originates from the crossing of the @xmath167 signatures of the @xmath1641/2 $ ] and @xmath1635/2 $ ] orbitals . to have such a situation the @xmath1641/2 $ ] state should be higher in energy than the @xmath1635/2 $ ] state at @xmath170 mev",
    "however , in nl1 the @xmath1641/2(r=+i)$ ] orbital is below the @xmath1635/2(r=+i)$ ] orbital at the self - consistent deformation of this configuration ( fig .",
    "18 of ref .",
    "rather similar results are obtained with the parameter sets nlsh and nl3 .",
    "based on the relevant neutron single - routhian diagrams one can conclude that in all parameterizations the position of the @xmath1641/2 $ ] orbital should be shifted higher in energy by @xmath273 mev relative to @xmath1635/2 $ ] .",
    "this is necessary in order to get the crossing of two orbitals at the correct frequency .    keeping in mind that the @xmath1391/2 $ ] orbital is more strongly down - sloping with the increase of the quadrupole deformation ( charge or mass quadrupole moments ) compared with the @xmath1685/2 $ ] orbital ( see for example fig .",
    "1.6 . in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a slight decrease of the self - consistent deformation could bring the results closer to experiment . for example , the inclusion of the pairing correlations might produce such a decrease of the self - consistent deformation .",
    "however , taking into account that the jumps in @xmath2 in the sd bands of the gd isotopes take place at high rotational frequency ( @xmath274 mev ) , it seems that the inclusion of pairing will not significantly improve the results .",
    "an alternative possibility , which perhaps more likely holds , is that the relative energies of the spherical subshells from which these states originate are not optimal in these rmf parameterizations .",
    "our analysis shows that all parameter sets , considered in this work , have some drawbacks which are related to the description of the energies of the single - particle states at superdeformation .",
    "however , this should have been expected as no single - particle properties have been used for the determination of the various rmf parameterizations .",
    "one should also keep in mind the rather small `` effective mass '' of the rmf theory which has an effect on the single - particle energies .",
    "thus , the role of the effective alignment approach is important for the theoretical interpretation of the structure of sd bands . to answer the question which parameter set is more suitable for the description of the energies of single - particle states at superdeformation ,",
    "a systematic investigation of the sd bands employing different parameterizations is needed .",
    "this , however , is an extremely time consuming procedure and beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "of course , the study of the single - particle spectra of the spherical doubly magic nuclei , obtained in various rmf parameterizations , could give some insight to this problem .",
    "we have chosen the @xmath275pb nucleus , for which rich experimental information is available . in fig .",
    "20 are shown the calculated energies of the single - particle states around the fermi surface together with the empirical values .",
    "it is seen that the calculated levels have a close correspondence with experiment .",
    "the theoretical spectra are less dense compared with experiment .",
    "the same is known from the non - relativistic density dependent hartree - fock calculations @xcite .",
    "such an effect , which appears mainly in medium heavy and heavy nuclei , is well explained in terms of the interplay between single - particle motion and low - lying collective vibrations ( see e.g. the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the neutron @xmath276 spherical gap is more or less reproduced in all three parameterizations . on the other hand , the non - linear set nl1 shows a gap at @xmath277 closer to experiment . in the nlsh parameterization ,",
    "the @xmath278 spherical gap is more pronounced than the @xmath277 spherical gap in contradiction with experiment .",
    "intermediate situation is observed for the nl3 parameterization . in this case , the @xmath278 spherical gap is similar to the @xmath277 spherical gap .",
    "all that might be considered as an indication that the non - linear set nl1 is more optimal for the description of the single - particle energies for the nuclei in the valley of beta - stability compared with nl3 and nlsh .",
    "however , more detailed investigation of this question is needed since the coupling between single - particle motion and low - lying collective vibrations is neglected in the present calculations .",
    "the single - particle properties at superdeformation and the dependence of the results for various observables on the lagrangian parameterization have been investigated in the framework of the cranked relativistic mean field theory . for our study",
    "the sd bands observed in the @xmath0 mass region have been used . in the following",
    "we summarize the main results of the present work .",
    "the alignment properties of the single - particle orbitals at superdeformation are reproduced adequately in the crmf theory in almost all cases studied with exception of yrast sd bands observed in @xmath279dy and bands 4 and 5 in @xmath140dy .",
    "this allows us to apply the effective alignment ( or similar ) approach for the identification of the configurations of the sd bands .",
    "the interpretation of the sd bands observed around @xmath8dy , first given by the cn model , have been confirmed .",
    "however , the effective alignments of the single - particle orbitals , calculated in the crmf theory , are typically in better agreement with experiment compared with the cn model .    in the case of yrast bands in @xmath279dy",
    "the experimental effective alignments related to non - intruder orbitals deviate significantly from the pattern expected from the experimental systematics seen in lighter nuclei .",
    "it was not possible to find a consistent interpretation for these bands in terms of non - intruder orbitals in a pure single - particle picture .",
    "this might be due to the influence of residual interactions neglected in the present investigation .",
    "though in our calculations pairing correlations have been neglected good agreement with experiment has been obtained in most of the cases .",
    "this is an indication that many features of the observed superdeformed bands , in this mass region , can be well understood in terms of an almost undisturbed single - particle motion .",
    "the stability of the results obtained within the crmf theory with respect to parameterization have been investigated employing the non - linear parameter sets nl1 , nl3 and nlsh for the sd bands observed in @xmath118 tb and @xmath136dy nuclei .",
    "the calculated kinematic @xmath63 and dynamic @xmath2 moments of inertia , the charge quadrupole @xmath3 and mass hexadecupole @xmath64 moments are rather similar in all parameterizations we have used .",
    "they are also close to experimental data .",
    "it turns out that the single - particle contributions to the charge quadrupole @xmath3 and mass hexadecupole @xmath64 moments are rather independent from the rmf parameterization .",
    "the effective alignments @xmath4 of the high-@xmath68 intruder orbitals and the single - particle contributions to the dynamic moments of inertia , arising from the occupation of the high-@xmath68 intruder orbitals show , however , some dependence from the parameterization .",
    "although in all parameterizations a similar group of single - particle states appear in the vicinity of the sd gaps , the relative energies of different single - particle states are strongly depended on the rmf parameterization . to define the parameter set which provides the better description of the energies of the single - particle states at superdeformation ,",
    "a more systematic investigation of the sd bands within the various rmf parameterizations is needed .",
    "the fact , however , that based only on the lowest and the slightly excited sd configurations , calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite with nl1 , it was possible to reproduce the effective alignments of the observed sd bands shows that this parameter set provides a reasonable description of the single - particle energies at superdeformation .",
    "undeniably a parameterization more oriented for superdeformation would provide improved results . keeping in mind however , that the limited number of the parameters of the rmf theory have been determined by means of a few ground state bulk properties of some spherical nuclei , it is rather amazing that in the limit of superdeformation the rmf theory describes the energies and the ordering of the single - particle states in the vicinity of the sd shell gaps with reasonable accuracy .",
