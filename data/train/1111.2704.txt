    "the advent of quantum mechanics ( qm ) and the problems linked to its ontological nature changed our conception of physical reality in a radical way , problems that before had concerned just philosophers of science became central to the physics debate .",
    "notions like observable , observer and measurement , which had not been problematic to the conception of physical theories , became fundamental and subject of numerous controversies .",
    "furthermore , the classical realist conception of physical objects as independent bearers of properties , on which the ontology of classical theories was based , was also challenged ; becoming evident the interpretational difficulties of the theory , a problem which physics had never affronted before .",
    "+ today , more than one hundred years after max planck formulated the quantum hypothesis , we still do not have a settled agreement about what quantum reality is or if there is something as a quantum reality at all .",
    "nevertheless , the theory has been incredibly successful in its predictive role . for this reason",
    ", many physicists think that probably there is no necessity of an interpretation of the theory that go further than the interpretation linked to its predictive nature .",
    "but , despite this predictive success , it has not been possible to conciliate the theory in its instrumentalist form with general relativity ( gr ) , and it is becoming evident that a new formalism , which give us a completely new perspective of the theory , will be needed to solve this problem . +",
    "numerous proposals have been advanced to solve the interpretational issues of qm , however , none of these have been able to transcend their heuristic argumentations with a solid mathematical machinery that captures and go further than the classical tools , settling the respective interpretation . our inability to do so",
    "is probably a sign that behind the understanding of qm hides the necessity to transcend also the classical mathematical formalism that lies at the foundations of the tools used so far to conceive physical theories .",
    "+ in recent years topos theory has captured the attention of people working on the foundations of qm as a possible route to reformulate the theory in a way flexible enough to include relativistic concepts , and where a definite interpretation could be finally settled .",
    "the origins of this approach can be traced back to the work developed by takeuti in 1975 on boolean valued models of set theory .",
    "takeuti proved that in a boolean valued model of set theory constructed over a complete boolean algebra of projector operators of a hilbert space , there is a correspondence between the self adjoint operators which spectral family is contained in the boolean algebra of projections and the real numbers of the boolean valued model @xcite@xcite . in those days",
    "the importance of this result respect to its possible relation with interpretational issues of qm was discussed ( see @xcite ) but no conclusive results were obtained , and maybe due to the fact that the result used advanced tools of set theory and logic , it did not capture the attention of the physics community .",
    "+ recently the work of c. isham , a. doering @xcite @xcite and others have brought the attention back to these methods and particularly to the idea that these tools can be used to obtain a new conception of the continuum useful to formulate quantum gravity theories and to obtain a new perspective of qm . even if not explicitly stated both , takeuti s and isham - doering s approaches , are a reformulation of the old idea proposed several times after the publication of the seminal paper in quantum logic ( ql ) by von neumann and birkhoff , regarding the necessity of a formalism founded over a quantum logic as a route to reformulate the theory in a way able to capture the essence of quantum reality .",
    "however , it is still not clear that this new approach will give us a better understanding of the theory .",
    "unfortunately , the intrinsic difficulties of cohen s forcing in the boolean formulation and the abstract categorical machinery of topos theory have obscured the potentiality of these methods to obtain a better picture of qm .",
    "+ in 1995 x. caicedo introduced what can be considered so far the most user - friendly approach to kripke - joyal semantics @xcite ( the semantics intrinsic to a topos ) , giving a new perspective that avoids the technicalities linked to the categorical tools of topoi .",
    "caicedo introduced a model theory of variable structures where it is possible to introduce a definition of genericity and a generic model theorem which unifies set theoretic forcing constructions and the classical theorems of model theory as completeness , compactness , omitting types etc .. in this context the approach to set theoretic forcing generalizes the scott - solovay boolean @xcite and the fitting intuitionistic @xcite formulations , simplifying the constructions and clarifying the essence of the proofs of classical independence results as the independence of the continuum hypothesis @xcite @xcite .",
    "another remarkable fact is how interesting connections between classical logic and intuitionistic logic are revealed , showing that the logic of sheaves is not just intuitionistic but that constitutes a continuum of logics between classical and intuitionistic logic , where the independence results of set theory and the classical theorems of model theory can be conceived as a consequence of some limit process over this continuum .",
    "+ in this work i apply these tools to qm , the idea in a few words is to show that the logic intrinsic to qm lies in this continuum of logics and then to show that the emergence of classicality can be conceived as a limit process over these logics . the logic used here will differ from the classical ql of von neumann and birkhoff ; its construction arises from the local character of truth of sheaf logic , which allows to introduce some contextual features of qm as those derived from the kochen - specker theorem and from the deutsch - everett multiversal interpretation of interference phenomena . over this logic a hierarchy of _ quantum variable sets _ is constructed that generalizes and simplifies the boolean approach of takeuti . in this model , two alternative proofs of takeuti s correspondence , between self adjoint operators and the real numbers of the model , are given .",
    "this approach results to be more constructive , showing a direct relation with the gelfand representation theorem , and revealing also the importance of these results with respect to the interpretation of qm in close connection with the deutsch - everett multiversal interpretation of quantum theory .",
    "finally it is shown how the collapse via generic models of this structure of quantum variable sets can help to explain the emergence of classicality also in close relation with the deutsch - everett perspective .",
    "+ i have divided this work in two main sections , the first one is an introduction to sheaf logic as developed in caicedo s work , giving here an approach oriented to physicists . even if it is not possible to get a complete picture of these tools without some knowledge of model theory and set theory the guiding ideas are very natural and can be followed without being an expert in these fields .",
    "the second part deals with the construction of the hierarchy of quantum variable sets and the results cited above .",
    "hopefully , the ideas contained here will be also useful to people working with applications of topos theory in physics , particularly bringing attention to the fundamental role of logic that sometimes is forgotten giving prevalence to the geometric character of the theory .",
    "as i argue in this work , the role of logic in these tools can be fundamental to obtain a new satisfactory picture of qm and probably the connections between geometry and logic , the most remarkable feature of topoi , will be fundamental in the construction of a future quantum gravity theory .",
    "the notion of a sheaf of structures has its origins on the study of the continuation of analytic functions in the xix century , but the modern definition was introduced just few years after the end of the second world war , by leray , cartan and lazard , in the context of algebraic topology and algebraic geometry .",
    "however , the idea of a sheaf of structures is naturally contained in the conception of spacetime which derives from the galilean relativity principle .",
    "the galilean relativity principle asserts that the dynamical laws are the same when are referred to any frame in uniform motion .",
    "this principle forces us to abandon the aristotelian picture of a fixed and absolute background space which constitutes a preferential frame where physical objects move .",
    "thus , the idea of considering a point in space as the same point an instant later looses its meaning .",
    "instead , galilean dynamics implies that there is not one fixed euclidean 3-dimensional space where the physical world is contained , but that to each instant corresponds a different 3-dimensional world @xcite , which is attached with the other worlds in a continuous way respect to the temporal order(see fig .",
    "[ gspace ] ) .",
    "each of these worlds is formed by objects which represent a snapshot of an extended object in time .",
    "there also exist functions and relations defined over each world , which represent and describe the instantaneous physical attributes of these extended objects .",
    "the continuous attachment refers to the possibility of seeing these extended objects as functions that at each time assign an object in the respective world in such a way that they form a continuous object as seeing from the perspective of the hole attachment . in the same way the functions and relations that give instantaneous descriptions attach also in a continuous way when seen as functions and relations of the attachment of the different instantaneous worlds .",
    "+ we can summarize this description of galilean spacetime as follows .",
    "we have a topological space @xmath0__temporal line _ _ , for each element @xmath1 there is an structure @xmath2 which is formed by a world @xmath3 which objects constitute a snapshot of extended objects in time , functions @xmath4 and relations @xmath5 which give the instantaneous properties of the extended objects at the instant @xmath6 .",
    "even if at each instant @xmath6 we have different worlds @xmath3 , this worlds are of a same kind in the sense that the functions , relations and objects can be given analogous interpretations at each instant .",
    "the different worlds @xmath3 attach in an extended universe @xmath7 in such a way that the attachment of the objects , functions and relations are continuous as seeing as extended objects , functions or relations defined in this extended world . in a few words at each instant @xmath6 we have an structure @xmath8 formed by a world of instantaneous snapshots of extended objects , functions and relations that attach in a continuous way .",
    "all this features can be easily formalized and generalized using the notion of a sheaf of structures .",
    "the ideas presented in this section follow @xcite , the proofs of the results presented here can be found there , however i will try to motivate the results and the main ideas can be understood without knowing all the technical details .",
    "let @xmath9 be a topological space .",
    "a sheaf over @xmath9 is a couple @xmath10 , where @xmath7 is a topological space and @xmath11 is a local homeomorphism , or in other words a continuous function such that for each @xmath12 there exists a neighbourhood @xmath13 of @xmath14 such that :    1 .",

    "this can be rather confusing but in some sense is just telling us that we are attaching structures of the same kind . on the other hand the properties ( i ) , ( ii),(iii ) determine that the structures attach in a smooth or continuous way .",

    "it can be proved for an arbitrary sheaf the next result : @xmath201 thus , this example shows how the logic of the sheaf of structures is related with the geometric properties of the sheaf .",
    "+ in general relativity , singularities in a spacetime @xmath202 can be added as boundary points in an extended manifold @xmath203 in such a way that the differential structure of the extended manifold captures the structure of the original manifold in some way . in some of these boundary constructions as those developed by geroch and schmidt ( see @xcite p.217 .",
    "p.276 respectively ) some points , where the hausdorff property does not hold , appear as a result of the construction of the boundary .",
    "furthermore this situation , in the schmidt construction , occurs in the schwarzschild and friedman solutions @xcite , which are our paradigms of strong curvature singularities .",
    "these non - hausdorff features have been seen as defects of these boundary constructions , but within the context of the example exposed above , probably what these results are telling us is that the singularities are a result of the breakdown of the logic which governed these models .",
    "the breakdown of the hausdorff property is probably the breakdown of the excluded middle in the singularity point in some appropriate sheaf description of spacetime .",
    "the difficulty to construct a satisfactory boundary definition such that the extended manifold conserve all the desirable features of a classical spacetime , is probably due to the fact that this formalism is inadequate to capture these situations .",
    "the breakdown of the hausdorff property is a sign of the breakdown of any possibility of classical description , non- hausdorff spacetimes affect the formulation of the cauchy problem , in non - hausdorff spacetime we can find bifurcating geodesics and classical determinism can loose all its sense .",
    "a new conception of manifold is needed , but within this new conception , local determinism will probably have a new meaning based on the ontology of qm , this is why a theory of quantum gravity can not be constructed before settling what quantum reality is .",

    "we will construct an analogous model which extend the notion of set , as a variable object over a sheaf , where the @xmath212 relation recover a new contextual meaning .      to introduce the definition of the cumulative hierarchy we can use the interpretation that categorists use to introduce the objects of @xmath213 , the advantage here",

    "+ one first aspect of contextuality arises from the kochen - specker theorem .",
    "in a few words what the kochen - specker theorem says is that in qm does not exist a valuation function from the set of physical observables , intended as self adjoint operators on a hilbert space @xmath284 , if the dimension of @xmath284 is greater than two .",
    "a valuation is a function @xmath285 from the set of self - adjoint operators @xmath286 on @xmath284 to the real numbers , @xmath287 , which satisfies : @xmath288 @xmath289 with @xmath290 a borel function . + on the other hand , locally or in a contextual sense , there exist valuations . if we consider an abelian von neumann subalgebra @xmath291 of the algebra of operators , the elements of the gelfand spectrum of @xmath291 ( i.e the positive linear functions @xmath292 of norm 1 such that @xmath293 for all @xmath294 ) when restricted to the self - adjoint operators in @xmath291 constitute a set of valuations which satisfy 1 and 2 above ( see @xcite ) .",
    "what the kochen - specker theorem is telling us is that none of this local valuations can be extended globally . +",
    "a history is characterized by the values that physical variables take on it ; therefore , we can see these valuations as histories , the kochen - specker theorem is telling us that the space of histories has a non trivial contextual structure .",
    "thus , a first notion of context is given by the histories associated to an abelian von neumann subalgebra of the algebra of operators of a hilbert space .",
    "as the elements of the gelfand spectrum of an algebra can be extended in different ways in two non compatible extensions of the original algebra , this contextual character is telling us that what is perceived as true by a history is conditioned by the context of similar histories , where similar is intended in this case as histories that can be expressed in function of the same observables .",
    "+ a second notion of contextuality arises from the phenomenon of interference in quantum mechanics .",
    "interference as intended in the deutsch - everett multiversal interpretation of quantum mechanics is the way as two histories can affect each other .",
    "interference phenomenons are strong enough to be detected only between universes or histories that are very similar , thus what is perceived by a history depends on the context of histories close to it , where close is intended in the sense of being similar . to describe this second contextual feature we use projections operators on a hilbert space @xmath284 .",
    "let @xmath291 be an abelian von neumann algebra of operators , @xmath295 the gelfand spectrum of @xmath291 and @xmath296 the set of projections of @xmath291 .",

    "i conjecture that these two notions of contextuality capture the essence of the logic of classical quantum mechanics . therefore , to develop a formalism able to capture the essence of quantum reality using the tools developed above ,",
    "we need a base space @xmath9 which structure captures these two notions of contextuality . unfortunately to capture both notions",
    "we will probably need something more general than a topological space and the respective generalization of the tools developed above , and it is here that tools of topos theory will be probably needed , this will be developed in a future work .",

    "this will be enough to capture the importance of the second notion of contextuality .",

    "_    we will see that in this new mathematical universe the tools we use to understand quantum mechanics recover new fundamental meanings that can be fundamental to settle a definite interpretation of qm .",
    "indeed , once we construct the continuum in this mathematical universe we find a fundamental result which shows the interpretative power of this model respect to quantum theory .      as in the previous section consider @xmath291 an abelian von neumann subalgebra of the algebra of operators of a hilbert space @xmath284 , and @xmath308 the gelfand spectrum of @xmath291 with the topology given by the sets @xmath310 as defined above .",
