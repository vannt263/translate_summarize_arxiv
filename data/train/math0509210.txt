    "the search for examples of surfaces with constant mean curvature dates back to the nineteenth century . unlike minimal surfaces , which have a weierstrass representation , the case of nonzero constant mean curvature ( / ) does not readily yield explicit examples",
    "; it thus appeared that constant mean curvature surfaces were scarce . in recent decades , however , several construction methods have evolved .",
    "wente s discovery of an immersed torus of constant mean curvature initiated the integrable - systems approach explored by abresch , bobenko , pinkall , sterling and others ; this in turn led to a generalized weierstrass representation by dorfmeister , pedit and wu .",
    "the ground - breaking analytic perturbation ( or gluing ) techniques of kapouleas have been extended by mazzeo , pacard , pollack , ratzkin and others .",
    "conjugate surface techniques , introduced by lawson , were developed further by karcher and  combined with new analytic methods  by the present authors .",
    "an abundance of known / surfaces has emerged , inviting their systematic study and classification .    with the conjugate surface method , we can study / surfaces with sufficient symmetries .",
    "this method is powerful in that it enables us to study entire families of surfaces , that is , components of suitably defined moduli spaces .",
    "in contrast , the gluing techniques mentioned above , while more widely applicable , tend to produce examples only near a boundary of the relevant moduli space .",
    "the generalized weierstrass representation also has the potential to deal with moduli spaces , even without any symmetry assumptions , but it has difficulty detecting key geometric features such as embeddedness .",

    "doubly and triply periodic surfaces @xcite , the discovery that bubbles can be created and deleted continuously on surfaces of finite topology  @xcite was surprising .",
    "this insight is what led us to expect our moduli spaces to be connected , and thus to look for the existence proof presented here , based on the continuity method of  @xcite .",
    "let us now make the setting of our paper precise .",

    "we consider a class of surfaces more general than the embedded ones , namely those bounding an immersed solid . to be precise , we define a finite topology / surface  @xmath4 to be _ -emb/ _ if  @xmath4 is properly immersed , if each end of  @xmath4 is embedded , and if there exists a compact 3-manifold  @xmath5 with boundary @xmath6 , and a proper immersion @xmath7 whose boundary restriction @xmath8 parametrizes  @xmath4 . moreover , we assume that the ( inward ) mean - curvature normal  @xmath9 of  @xmath4 points into  @xmath5 .",

    "our terminology is justified by the asymptotics result of korevaar , kusner and solomon :    [ th : kksasym ] each end of a @xmath2-unduloid is exponentially asymptotic to a delaunay unduloid , and thus has an asymptotic axis and necksize @xmath10 $ ] .    for @xmath12 ,",
    "all @xmath2-unduloids have genus zero , and their classification is well - known : alexandrov  @xcite showed the round sphere is the only @xmath13-unduloid ; meeks  @xcite showed there are no @xmath3-unduloids ; and the delaunay unduloids themselves are the only @xmath14-unduloids  @xcite .    a  surface",
    "is called _ coplanar _ if it is contained in a half - space of  @xmath15 . for @xmath16 ,",
    "all @xmath2-unduloids are coplanar  @xcite .",
    "the alexandrov reflection method extends to coplanar @xmath2-unduloids  @xcite , showing that any such surface  @xmath4 is _ alexandrov - symmetric _ in the following sense : it has a reflection plane  @xmath17 such that @xmath18 has two connected components @xmath19 whose gauss images  @xmath20 are contained in disjoint open hemispheres ; moreover @xmath21 is contained in the equator .",

    "we want to study moduli spaces of coplanar @xmath2-unduloids with genus zero .",
    "thus we identify two such @xmath2-unduloids when they differ by a rigid motion in space and we label the ends to avoid orbifold points at surfaces with extra symmetry .",
    "it is convenient to represent any coplanar @xmath2-unduloid with the horizontal @xmath22-plane as its fixed mirror plane  @xmath17 , such that the labels of the ends occur in cyclic order :    let us fix @xmath23 points @xmath24 in cyclic order along the equator of  @xmath25 .",

    ", there is still a natural map from coplanar @xmath2-unduloids of genus zero to @xmath2-tuples on  @xmath25 , but this no longer suffices to classify the surfaces .",
    "instead , we need to employ a space  @xmath32 of spherical metrics , whose precise definition will be given below .",
    "our classification says that @xmath27 is homeomorphic to  @xmath32 :    for each @xmath33 , there is a homeomorphism @xmath34 from the moduli space  @xmath27 of coplanar @xmath2-unduloids of genus  @xmath13 to the connected manifold  @xmath32 of @xmath2-point metrics .",
    "the necksizes of a @xmath2-unduloid @xmath35 are the spherical distances of the @xmath2  consecutive pairs of completion points in  @xmath36 .    as a consequence we have the following constraints on the necksizes of a coplanar @xmath2-unduloid of genus  @xmath13 .",

    "rhcyl1    rhcyl2    rhcyl3    rhcyl4    our theorem should be compared with the classification of coplanar minimal surfaces by cos'n and ros  @xcite .",
    "the classifying space for their minimal @xmath2-noids consists of planar polygons , whose combinatorial description is well - known .",
    "another simplification arises because they are able to prove directly that all their surfaces are nondegenerate .",
    "we are not aware of any other classification results for moduli spaces of minimal or / surfaces with more than three ends .",
    "very recently , in joint work  @xcite with korevaar and ratzkin ( following up on  @xcite ) , we have augmented the results of this paper as follows : all coplanar @xmath2-unduloids of genus zero are nondegenerate , so that @xmath27 is a real - analytic manifold , and a tubular neighborhood of it in the space of all @xmath2-unduloids is a @xmath41manifold .",
    "furthermore , our classifying map  @xmath34 is a ( real - analytic ) diffeomorphism .",
    "we conclude this introduction with an overview of our paper . in section  1 , we define the classifying map @xmath34 as a composition of the following maps : by coplanarity and theorem  [ th : kkscopl ] , we first associate to each @xmath35 its /  @xmath42 . since @xmath4 has genus zero , @xmath42 is an open disk .",
    "it thus has a conjugate cousin , an isometric minimal immersion to the three - sphere .",
    "hopf projection of this cousin disk to the @xmath14-sphere produces a metric on @xmath42 locally isometric to @xmath25 , which we call the spherical @xmath2-point metric @xmath36 .",
    "central for our paper is the analysis ( in sections  2 and  3 ) of the space  @xmath32 of spherical @xmath2-point metrics . in section  2 , we start with a combinatorial decomposition of each metric @xmath43 . in view of the classifying map , analyzing metrics amounts to analyzing coplanar @xmath2-unduloids , yielding a decomposition of the surface into bubbles . on cylindrical parts of a @xmath2-unduloid ,",
    "such a decomposition is necessarily ambiguous .",
    "for this reason , our decomposition can not be unique , making the analysis somewhat involved .    in section  3",
    ", we apply our combinatorial decomposition to show that @xmath32 is a connected manifold .",
    "we analyze the example  @xmath44 completely to find that that  @xmath45 is a five - ball , generalizing the result of  @xcite that @xmath46 is a three - ball .",
    "our combinatorial description is not explicit enough to decide whether  @xmath32 is always a @xmath47ball .",
    "( in ongoing joint work with korevaar , using a mbius - invariant decomposition of @xmath2-point metrics , we expect to be able to show that indeed @xmath48 for all @xmath33 . )    in section  4 , we prove injectivity and properness of our classifying map .",
    "injectivity follows by applying a maximum principle to the cousin surfaces ( just as in the case @xmath29 of  @xcite ) .",
    "properness involves _ a priori _ estimates , corresponding to the closedness part of a traditional continuity method .",
    "the proof here is somewhat different than in the case @xmath29 because of the possibility of small necks occurring away from the ends .",
    "still , our characterization of compact subsets of  @xmath32 allows us to prove the needed area and curvature estimates .    in section  5",
    ", we establish the surjectivity of our classifying map . as in @xcite ,",
    "the crucial point is to apply a structure theorem for real - analytic varieties .",
    "thus we must show that our spaces  @xmath27 , consisting of coplanar surfaces with a mirror symmetry , are real - analytic .",
    "for this , we adapt the methods of  @xcite , which dealt with the space of all @xmath2-unduloids .",
    "more generally , we show that for any fixed finite symmetry group , the moduli space of symmetric @xmath2-unduloids is real - analytic , a result which has applications beyond this paper  @xcite .",
    "then we can apply our version of the continuity method , as introduced in  @xcite , to prove the main theorem .",

    "take a component @xmath42 of @xmath51 and orient @xmath42 such that the boundary labels occur in increasing cyclic order : this means that @xmath42 lies to the left of  @xmath52 . by a rotation of @xmath4 in @xmath15",

    "if at each end of  @xmath4 we truncate @xmath54 and join in a locally embedded way , then we obtain an embedded loop in  @xmath17 with turning number one .",
    "however , in general ends of  @xmath4 may cross ( as in  figure  [ fig : crossed ends ] , right ) and thus no longer appear in the same order in  @xmath17 .",
    "we note that for large  @xmath2 , most coplanar @xmath2-unduloids have such crossed ends and thus fail to be embedded . by alexandrov symmetry , the projection of  @xmath42 to  @xmath17 gives an immersed disk , so that the turning number of the corresponding boundary loop is still one .",

    "we continuously change the metric on any such triangle according to the motion of @xmath149 to  @xmath267 , but we fix the metric on the remaining triangles ( those not incident to @xmath143 ) . under this new @xmath2-point metric , @xmath28 develops to  @xmath267 ; this confirms that we have constructed a continuous local inverse for  @xmath222 .    to show that @xmath222 is a covering over @xmath252 , note that @xmath252 is exactly the set where the @xmath149 are distinct . in this case , the neighborhood @xmath268 is trivially covered by @xmath269 because we can use the same triangulation  @xmath196 for any @xmath270 .      what initially led us to believe that  @xmath27 is connected was that we can imagine a path from any given @xmath2-unduloid @xmath35 to a standard one , say a dihedrally symmetric one .",

    "we now proceed to analyze in detail the structure of the space  @xmath44 of @xmath163-point metrics , proving that it is diffeomorphic to a @xmath164-ball .",

    "we define @xmath326 to be the subset where @xmath327 .",
    "then @xmath328 is well - defined and indeed a deformation retract .",
    "in fact , @xmath113 is the desired bundle with fiber  @xmath317 : the @xmath317-valued expression @xmath329 is @xmath324-invariant , hence well - defined on  @xmath314 , and it gives a trivialization away from @xmath330 ; by symmetry a similar trivialization exists away from @xmath315 .    in our picture , @xmath331 is the subspace where @xmath332 and @xmath333 .",
    "so if we define @xmath334 the bundle @xmath335 restricts to a @xmath317-bundle @xmath336 .",

    "the fundamental group of @xmath312 is @xmath368 .",
    "the first generator  @xmath369 is a loop represented by @xmath105 circling counterclockwise around  @xmath340 ; in terms of @xmath348 , it corresponds to a loop around the deleted line at  @xmath3 .",

    "we claim that every lift of @xmath131 to @xmath364 is a loop , while the lifts of @xmath369 are not .",
    "this means that the covering @xmath371 is normal , corresponding to the normal subgroup generated by  @xmath131 .",
    "the covering map @xmath372 can be then explicitly given as @xmath373 with @xmath367 , and we can represent @xmath364 as the pullback @xmath317-bundle over  @xmath365 .    to prove the claim , we will work over the deformation retract  @xmath343 . because @xmath327 and @xmath374 are antipodal , truncations of metrics projecting to  @xmath343 are not unique . to overcome this difficulty we adopt the convention that we always truncate that end along an arc developing to the positive reals .",
    "this corresponds to viewing the point @xmath375 as a limit of @xmath376 for @xmath377 positive real .",
    "we fix a basepoint @xmath378 .",
    "we can use our decomposition results to analyze any metric in the fiber over  @xmath17 . because of the order of the four points in the circle , and our convention for drawing diagonals  @xmath379 , each decomposition piece is isometric to a slit sphere",
    ". furthermore exactly two pieces are @xmath161-gons , with vertices either @xmath380 and @xmath381 , or @xmath382 and @xmath383 .",
    "metrics in the fiber over  @xmath17 are completely characterized by the choice of one of these two types , together with the nonnegative number of slit spheres between the two triangles .    more explicitly ,",
    "suppose we truncate a @xmath163-point metric  @xmath116 in the fiber over  @xmath17 , using again a diagonal @xmath379 which projects to the positive reals .",
    "the @xmath163-gon @xmath136 obtained has four interior angles @xmath384 ; each of these is an integer multiple of  @xmath146 .",
    "the alternating sum @xmath385 is unchanged if we add @xmath146 to two consecutive angles , and hence is independent of the truncation @xmath136 we have chosen .",
    "note that the area of  @xmath136 and the number @xmath386 are each multiples of  @xmath210 .",
    "thus the gauss  bonnet theorem shows that @xmath92 must be odd ; the odd integer  @xmath92 uniquely characterizes a metric @xmath387 in the fiber over  @xmath17 .",
    "this also follows from our combinatorial picture : indeed , @xmath160 has a diagonal @xmath388 when @xmath389 and a diagonal @xmath390 when @xmath391 ; the number of slit spheres along this diagonal is @xmath392 .",
    "now choose a truncation @xmath136 of  @xmath160 with at least one slit sphere added at each end .",
    "the loops @xmath369 and  @xmath131 in  @xmath343 can be lifted to paths in  @xmath44 with initial point  @xmath160 .",
    "these paths also have a unique lift starting at  @xmath136 in the space @xmath393 of @xmath163-gons , provided no angle  @xmath394 becomes zero . indeed ,",
    "this is easy to see if the paths are chosen to avoid antipodal pairs in the @xmath163-tuple : then the unique geodesics between them lead to a unique continuation of the truncation .",
    "let us now observe the effect of these lifts of @xmath369 and  @xmath131 on the angles  @xmath394 .",
    "since only @xmath105 moves and the edge @xmath379 stays fixed ( by our convention ) , the angle  @xmath395 remains constant . for @xmath131 , as @xmath105 moves around @xmath370 ( which is antipodal to  @xmath321 ) the edge @xmath396 rotates once around the sphere .",
    "this means that @xmath397 and  @xmath398 each decrease by  @xmath146 .",
    "since the angle  @xmath399 stays nearly constant all along  @xmath131 , it must return to its initial value .",
    "we conclude that @xmath92 is fixed , and so @xmath131 lifts to a loop in  @xmath364 . for  @xmath369 ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath398 is nearly constant , @xmath399 increases by @xmath146 and  @xmath397 decreases by  @xmath146 ; thus @xmath92 decreases by  @xmath14 .",
    "thus @xmath369 changes the metric @xmath160 to  @xmath400 .",
    "this completes the proof of the claim .",
    "the space  @xmath44 is diffeomorphic to an open 5-ball .",
    "remember that @xmath401 consists of two arcs @xmath350 and  @xmath351 .",
    "the decision of where to fill in copies of these arcs into the covering space @xmath365 is purely combinatorial , based on the decompositions of the metrics in @xmath402 .",
    "we can connect our basepoint @xmath403 to the fibers over these arcs by simple paths : the first path moves only  @xmath105 ( along the reals to  @xmath13 ) ; the second moves only  @xmath340 ( along the reals to  @xmath404 ) .",
    "we use these paths to extend the odd labels  @xmath92 from the fiber over  @xmath17 .",
    "now we note that @xmath405 is allowed in @xmath44 exactly when there is no diagonal @xmath406 .",
    "thus the arc @xmath350 gets filled in exactly at the levels with negative label @xmath391 . similarly the arc @xmath351 gets filled in exactly at the levels with @xmath389 .",
    "this means that at each level , exactly one of the two arcs gets filled in .",
    "again , the decision is purely combinatorial : whenever we fill in a single point , we fill in an entire arc into  @xmath365 , and @xmath44 contains the entire @xmath317-bundle over this arc . in the picture @xmath367",
    ", we fill in the lower half ( @xmath407 ) of the missing lines where @xmath408 , and the upper half ( @xmath409 ) of the others where @xmath410 ; this leaves us with a space @xmath411 diffeomorphic to a three - ball .",
    "finally , @xmath44 is a @xmath317-bundle over this ball , which must be trivial , meaning that @xmath44 is a five - ball .",

    "the proof of properness is where substantial modifications are needed . in particular , since the classifying space is  @xmath32 , not  @xmath232 , we need to characterize the compact subsets of  @xmath32 for general  @xmath2 .      as for triunduloids we have for coplanar @xmath2-unduloids of genus zero :    [",

    "the proof is essentially the same as for triunduloids .",
