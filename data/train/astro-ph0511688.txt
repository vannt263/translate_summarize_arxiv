    "researchers have concluded the universe is almost flat , and we are forced to recognize the existence of a cosmological constant , or a kind of dark energy whose value is almost the same order of magnitude as the present density of the universe  @xcite . from the viewpoint of particle physics , however , it is quite difficult to explain such a tiny value that is @xmath9 orders of magnitude smaller than the electroweak scale .",
    "the failure of theory to explain the present value of the cosmological constant is known as the  cosmological constant problem \"  @xcite .    in order to avoid this problem , many dark energy models have been proposed from various contexts . roughly speaking",
    ", they can be classified into two approaches : one is to modify the gravitational law and the other is to introduce some exotic form of energy .",
    "for familiar examples , @xmath10 gravity models  @xcite and braneworld models  @xcite belong to the former , while quintessence models  @xcite , k - essence models  @xcite and phantom models  @xcite belong to the latter .",
    "regardless of the attempts mentioned above , it is fair to say that a satisfactory explanation for dark energy has not yet been obtained . on the other hand , from the phenomenological viewpoint ,",
    "it is important to constrain the effective equation of state of the dark energy @xmath2 by observations . even though we have obtained the constraint as @xmath11 ( 95 % confidence limit assuming @xmath12 )  @xcite by combining wmap data with other astronomical data , in order to pin down @xmath2 , it is necessary to use other independent observational tools .    for this purpose ,",
    "we consider the statistical properties of the large - scale structure of the universe based on the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the cosmological density fluctuations . in the standard picture ,",
    "the pdf of the primordial density fluctuations originated from quantum fluctuations that were stretched to large comoving scales during the inflation phase and are assumed to be a random gaussian .",
    "it is , however , well known that even though pdf remains gaussian as long as the density fluctuation is in the linear regime , it significantly deviates from the initial gaussian shape once the non - linear stage is reached .",
    "regarding the shape of the pdf , it has been shown that in standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) models , the pdf is fairly approximated by lognormal distribution in a weakly non - linear regime  @xcite , while the lognormal pdf does not fit well in a highly non - linear regime  @xcite .",

    "if we assume a homogeneous and isotropic universe , the cosmic expansion law is described by the friedmann equations and the energy conservation equation . @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a scale factor of the universe",
    ", @xmath17 is its hubble parameter , @xmath18 is a curvature constant , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the total pressure and total energy of matter fields .    as for matter fields , since we are interested in a stage much later than the radiation - matter equality , we consider matter fluid and dark energy , i.e. , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the matter fluid energy densities matter fluid and dark energy , respectively . in order to obtain the evolution of the energy densities for each component",
    ", we must specify the properties of dark energy which are strongly dependent on dark energy models .    even though there are some dark energy models in which dark energy couples explicitly to ordinal matter  @xcite , dark energy interacts with ordinal matter only gravitationally in many models .",
    "we consider the case in which the energy conservation of each component holds independently .",
    "for these situations , since the pressure of the matter is negligible , its energy density evolves as usual : @xmath24 as for the evolution of dark energy , we can use the fact that it is possible to model dark energy as fluid in many dark energy models  @xcite . for this case",
    ", the dynamical properties of dark energy are determined through its effective equation of state @xmath2 : @xmath25 where , in general , @xmath2 is an analytic function of the energy density , or equivalently , the scale factor . in principle , the evolution of energy density is determined by integrating the energy conservation equation : @xmath26},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is an integration constant .",
    "the condition for the acceleration of the cosmic expansion is given as @xmath28 where , if we are not to violate the strong energy condition , we should further impose @xmath29 however , since it is technically difficult to specify the time dependence of @xmath2 by observations in near future , we concentrate on the case for constant @xmath2 , in which case dark energy density evolves as @xmath30 assuming flat spacetime ( @xmath31 ) and using eqs .",

    "@xmath33 the subscripts @xmath34 denote the corresponding quantities are evaluated at present .    under this constraint , we solve the friedmann equation ( eq .",
    "( [ eqn : friedmann - ii ] ) ) .",
    "next , we introduce the evolution equations for the density fluctuation of matter . since we are interested in a scale much smaller than the horizon scale and non - relativistic matter fluid , we apply a newtonian treatment . notice that after this , @xmath20 denotes the mass density , even though we used the same character as in the previous section . here , we start with comoving coordinates along the cosmic expansion characterized by the solution @xmath35 of eq .",

    "since we note non - relativistic fluid as matter , we can ignore the pressure and omit the suffix @xmath45 .    in this paper , for the perturbation",
    ", we adopt the lagrangian picture rather than the eulerian picture since we can extract the quasi - nonliniear nature of the structure formation even if we consider only the linear perturbation @xcite . for this purpose , it is necessary to define the comoving lagrangian coordinates @xmath46 in terms of the comoving eulerian coordinates @xmath38 as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the displacement vector denoting the deviation from homogeneous distribution . while in eulerian perturbation theory , the density fluctuation @xmath49 is regarded as a perturbative quantity ; in lagrangian perturbation theory , the displacement vector @xmath48 is regarded as a perturbative quantity .",

    "this is quite natural if it is generated only by the action of gravity .",

    ", we adopt the top - hat window function , @xmath72    then , the density fluctuation @xmath73 at the position @xmath38 smoothed over the scale @xmath66 can be constructed in terms of @xmath65 . for simplicity",
    "we use @xmath49 to denote @xmath73 unless otherwise stated .",
    "in order to analyze the statistics , we introduce a one - point probability distribution of the density fluctuation field @xmath74 ( pdf of the density perturbation ) which denotes the probability of obtaining the value @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath49 is a random gaussian field , the pdf of the density perturbation is determined as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 denotes the spacial average .    if the pdf deviates from gaussian distribution , in order to specify it , it is necessary to introduce the following higher - order statistical quantities  @xcite : @xmath78 which mean the display asymmetry and non - gaussian degree of `` peakiness , '' respectively .",
    "in eulerian perturbation theory , the gaussianity of the pdf completely conserves if we start with gaussian distribution , because the density fluctuation is described by the product of the time and the spacial component and the spacial component never changes as long as we keep only linear terms .",
    "once nonlinear terms are considered , however , its pdf deviates from the initial gaussian shape because of the strong nonlinear mode coupling and the nonlocality of the gravitational dynamics . on the other hand , since in lagrangian perturbation theory , the quasi - nonlinear information in the sense of the eulerian picture can be extracted even by linear perturbation , we can expect to obtain nontrivial information for the skewness and the kurtosis after @xmath79 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : dust - sigma - el ] .    .",
    "here we choose the smoothing scale @xmath80 for the top - hat window function .",
    "after @xmath79 , the difference of the dispersion appears between eulerian and lagrangian in which eulerian linear perturbation no longer provides accurate values .",

    "in this section , after mentioning the conditions we impose , we present our results .",

    "@xmath87 where @xmath59 corresponds to the cosmological constant .",
    "even though @xmath88 has already been excluded , we calculate this just for comparison . in the case of @xmath89 ,",
    "as mentioned before , the strong energy condition is violated .    as for the smoothing scale @xmath66 for the top - hat window function ,",
    "we set @xmath90 in the comoving eulerian coordinates at the present time ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "because we apply lagrangian linear perturbation , we must consider the validity of the perturbation . as we will show later",
    ", it is reasonable that we set the smoothing scale @xmath80 if we are to discuss the structure formation with the perturbation .",
    "based on @xmath49 calculated from these conditions , we compute the statistical quantities , i.e. , the dispersion , the skewness and the kurtosis at 51 time slices from @xmath91 to @xmath92 whose time intervals are given as @xmath93 .    before presenting the results",
    ", we must remind ourselves that since these calculations are based on lagrangian linear perturbation theory , we can trust the results until caustics are produced , i.e. , when @xmath94 becomes @xmath95 .    figure  [ fig : de - sigma ] shows the time evolution of the dispersion of the density fluctuation for several equations of state .",
    "the growth of the dispersion monotonously continues until @xmath92 . because we choose a relatively large value for the smoothing length , the lagrangian linear perturbation still has physical meaning .",
    "the tendency of structure formation can be discussed even if structure formation can no longer be fully described with linear approximation .",
    "we can identify the difference of the dispersion among several values of @xmath2 . as the value of @xmath2 becomes larger ( approaches to 0 ) ,",
    "the dispersion becomes smaller .",
    "this can be explained as follows : for the model with larger @xmath2 , dark energy dominates at earlier era , and the expansion of the universe starts to accelerate at earlier era , while it can be shown that the growth of the density fluctuation is smaller in the accelerating stage than in the matter - dominant stage",
    ".    here we consider high-@xmath8 region , i.e. , @xmath96 . in our previous paper",

    ", the growth of the skewness and the kurtosis continues monotonously .",
    "for the reason mentioned above , our computations seem to be reliable until @xmath102 .",
    "for the case where @xmath88 , the value of both the skewness and the kurtosis is obviously less than that for the cases where @xmath89 , @xmath103 and @xmath98 ( about @xmath5 and about @xmath104 , respectively ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the differences of both the skewness and the kurtosis among @xmath105 , @xmath59 and @xmath98 are less than @xmath106 at @xmath99 .",
    "even though these are very small values , they are of almost the same order as the relative ratio of the dispersions .",
    "therefore it can be expected that non - gaussianity can play a potentially important role in distinguishing the value of @xmath2 from the observation of high - z galaxies . at that stage ,",
    "the fitting functions for @xmath107 , @xmath108 for the quasi - nonlinear stage are useful .",
    "since it seems that the growth of the dispersion and the non - gaussianity are related , it is worth trying to find the functions based on our results .",
    "finally , if we want to know precise information for non - gaussianity after @xmath109 , we must consider nonlinear dynamics by such as n - body simulations . even though we do not compute them in this paper , judging from fig.1 in our previous paper , @xcite ,",
    "in which we compare the results of lagrangian perturbation and n - body simulation in the einstein - de sitter universe , we can expect the actual non - gaussianity is strengthened by a order of magnitude .",
    "if this happens also for accelerating universes , it becomes easier to distinguish @xmath2 from the observations of the near galaxies , which is worth investigating .",

    "we compute the skewness and the kurtosis which are statistical quantities denoting the degree of non - gaussianity as well as the dispersion , which is the only parameter for gaussian distribution . by considering several constant-@xmath2 dark energy models , we present the @xmath2 dependence of non - gaussianity . because of the validity of the perturbative approach",
    ", we regard the results until @xmath102 as reliable .    according to our calculation , at fixed time @xmath110 ,",
    "the dispersion becomes smaller as @xmath2 becomes larger ( approaches to 0 ) .",
    "this is because the larger @xmath2 is , the earlier the time at which the expansion of the universe starts to accelerate and the growth of the density fluctuation is smaller than in the matter - dominant universe .",
    "the skewness and the kurtosis also become smaller as @xmath2 becomes larger ( approaches to 0 ) , which suggests they have some correlation with the dispersion .",
    "the difference of non - gaussianity between @xmath59 and @xmath88 is obvious ( about @xmath5 ) for @xmath111 , while it is hard for @xmath2 to distinguish @xmath112 , @xmath113 or @xmath114 .",

    "for this case , it becomes easier to distinguish the value of @xmath2 from the observation of near galaxies , which is worth continuing to consider .",
    "it is necessary to mention the possibility of examining our results .",
    "recently , several galaxy redshift survey projects have been progressing  @xcite . in these projects ,",
    "many galaxies within a region ( @xmath115 for 2df , @xmath116 for sdss , and @xmath117 for deep2 ) have been observed .",

    "for example , the cosmic inflation probe ( cip ) project  @xcite is planned to detect objects between @xmath118 .",
    "another project , the kilo - aperture optical spectrograph ( kaos ) , has also been proposed  @xcite .",
    "one of the primary scientific purposes of kaos is the determination of the equation of state of dark energy by objects until @xmath119 .",
    "another purpose of kaos is to observe the growth of structure .",
    "the projects leaders propose that the linear growth factor of matter density fluctuations can also provide sensitivity to dark energy properties .",
    "the skewness and the kurtosis of the distribution of galaxies in the sdss early data release had been computed  @xcite .",
    "the results suggested the sdss imaging data can enable us to determine the skewness and the kurtosis up to 1% and less than 10% .",
    "therefore in future projects , we can expect to determine the skewness and the kurtosis with high accuracy . from our results",
    ", the kurtosis of the density fluctuation seems more sensitive for @xmath2 than the dispersion of the fluctuation . in other words , although the dispersion reflects the linear growth factor , the kurtosis shows the nature of nonlinear growth in addition to the linear growth .",
    "therefore , structual non - gaussianity of would show more detailed information on the nature of dark energy .",
    "it is worth noting that for such a high-@xmath8 region , the results obtained in this paper based on our perturbative approach will play an important role .",
    "finally , it is worth noting the primordial non - gaussianity which is generated by inflation .",
    "from wmap observations , a limit for the non - linear coupling parameter has been established @xcite which does not deny the existence of non - gaussianity in the primordial density fluctuation . even though we can not disentangle them generally",
