    "though co traces most of the molecular gas mass in galaxies , it does not necessarily trace active star - forming regions where the gas density is more than 10 times higher than the average .",
    "these regions are better traced by high dipole moment molecules like hcn , cs and hco@xmath6 .",
    "consequently , these molecules have often been used as probes of physical conditions in giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) cores  the regions of active star formation in the milky way .",
    "yet there have been few systematic studies of dense gas in gmcs in the disk of the milky way .",
    "lee , snell , & dickman ( 1990 ) have found that for milky way disk gmcs , the ratio of co / cs intensity is 156 , much larger than for galactic center clouds and an order of magnitude larger than for the archetypal ulig arp  220 ( solomon , radford , & downes 1990 ) .",
    "some dense clumps in some nearby gmcs have also been surveyed in cs ( lada , bally , & stark 1991 ; plume 1997 ) and in hcn ( helfer & blitz 1997b ) .",
    "although there are some recent attempts in galactic plane hcn , cs , and co observations ( helfer & blitz 1997b ; mcquinn 2002 and references therein ) , only the central region of the galaxy has been extensively mapped with dense molecular gas tracers ( , cs , bally 1987 , 1988 ; hcn , jackson 1996 ; lee 1996 ) . systematic and unbiased large - scale observations of",
    "the dense molecular gas in galactic disk gmcs need continued study since the large - scale ( kpc ) distribution of dense gas in the milky way disk ( cf .",
    "mcquinn 2002 ) is a basis for comparison with dense molecular gas observations in external galaxies ( , paglione 1998 ) .",
    "hcn and cs are probably the most frequently observed interstellar molecules after co. because of their higher dipole moments ( @xmath7 2.0  3.0 d ) , they require about 2 orders of magnitude higher densities for collisional excitation than co ( @xmath8 0.1 d ) .",
    "hcn is one of the most abundant high dipole moment molecules and traces molecular gas at densities @xmath9(h@xmath10  @xmath5 ( compared to densities at @xmath11  @xmath5 traced by co ) .",
    "hcn j=1 - 0 emission has been so far detected toward the nuclei of @xmath12 10 nearby galaxies ( nguyen - q - rieu , nakai , & jackson 1989 ; nguyen - q - rieu 1992 ; henkel 1990 ) , 10 relatively distant luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ligs and uligs with ir luminositiesm to 1000 @xmath2 m ) is calculated according to the prescription in sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) using measurements from all 4 flux bands . ]",

    "there are significant overlaps in the galaxy samples among these various observations , and the total number of galaxies with hcn detections is still @xmath15 , particularly the total hcn emission measured globally from the galaxies .",
    "a recent summary of hcn observations in centers of nearby galaxies can be found in sorai ( 2002 ) and shibatsuka ( 2003 ) .    in a few of the nearest galaxies ,",
    "interferometer hcn maps have also been obtained in the nuclear regions ( carlstrom 1988 ; 1990 ; radford 1991 ; downes 1992 ; brouillet & schilke 1993 ; jackson 1993 ; helfer & blitz 1995 , 1997a ; tacconi 1994 ; shen & lo 1995 ; paglione , tosaki , & jackson 1995b ; kohno 1996 ; kohno , kawabe , & vila - vilaro 1999 ) .",

    "the presence of large amounts of dense molecular gas in the central @xmath12 1 kpc of galaxies has been well established ( for an earlier review , see mauersberger & henkel 1993 ) .    the main goal of this paper is to present a systematic hcn survey of a large sample of normal spiral galaxies and relatively distant ligs and uligs .",
    "this includes an attempt to measure the total hcn emission in nearby large spiral galaxies by mapping the hcn distribution along the major axes ( gao 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "we examine correlations between hcn emission and various   bands and discuss the excitation mechanisms of hcn .",
    "we here argue that hcn is primarily excited by collision with molecular hydrogen at high density and thus can be used as a tracer of dense molecular gas .",
    "we concentrate here on presenting observations of hcn j=1 - 0 only since it is almost always the strongest line among these high dipole moment molecules , and thus the easiest and most often observed dense gas tracer in external galaxies ( gao 1996 ) .",
    "we have not only doubled the total number of galaxies with hcn j=1 - 0 detections in the literature for the last decade , but we have also extensively mapped the inner disk hcn emission in a few nearby galaxies in order to estimate the total hcn emission .",
    "we will explore in detail the extent and radial distribution of dense molecular gas in nearby galaxies in a future paper and present the detailed hcn mapping observations there ( y. gao & p.m. solomon in preparation ) . in a companion paper ( gao & solomon 2004 , paper ii ) , we fully discuss the interpretation and implications of our hcn survey .",
    "we describe the sample selection and characteristics of our hcn survey in the next section . in   3 , we discuss our various observations and the observational strategies conducted at different telescopes .",
    "the survey results are presented in   4 , where we show all the hcn j=1 - 0 and co spectra , tabulate the observational data , and summarize the global quantities for all galaxies .",
    "we have confirmed the tight correlation between the ir and hcn emission , initially proposed by solomon ( 1992 ) based on the hcn observations of a sample of 10 representative galaxies , in a large and statistically significant sample of more than 60 galaxies when both samples are combined .",
    "we have also checked for any significant dependence of the hcn emission upon the excess mid - ir emission as indicated by an flux ratio of the 12 and 100 @xmath2 m emission or the ratio of the 12 @xmath2 m and total ir emission to address the possibly enhanced excitation of hcn j=1 - 0 emission by mid - ir radiative pumping through a vibrational transition .",
    "moreover , the use of hcn as a tracer of high - density molecular gas is discussed using large velocity gradient ( lvg ) calculations .",
    "finally , we summarize the main points of this hcn survey in   5 .",
    "our goal is to survey a large sample of galaxies ( @xmath17 ) with a wide range of ir luminosities where the total hcn j=1 - 0 emission from the whole inner disk or entire galaxy can be measured .",
    "essentially , all galaxies with strong co and ir emission were chosen for our hcn observations .",
    "our hcn survey sample is mainly drawn from the co observations of solomon ( 1997 ) , sanders , scoville , & soifer ( 1991 ) , tinney ( 1990 ) , solomon & sage ( 1988 ) , and young ( 1989 , 1995 ) .",
    "almost all galaxies with an antenna temperature measured by various telescopes to be greater than 100  mk ( or 50  mk for ligs ) were included as candidate galaxies .",
    "these cutoffs were specifically used in order to select all truly co - bright galaxies in the hope of detecting their hcn emission ( which is typically 1020 times weaker than co ) with a rms sensitivity at the level of @xmath18mk .",
    "most ir - bright galaxies with  @xmath19   are included as well in our sample ( rice 1988 ; strauss 1992 ) .",
    "we thus selected @xmath16 nearest co and/or ir bright large galaxies with   @xmath20 ,   and a few tens of relatively distant yet still nearby `` normal '' spiral galaxies and ligs .",
    "moreover , most northern uligs in the local universe ( cz @xmath21 20,000 ) were also added to enlarge our sample at this extremely high ir luminosity .",
    "we detected hcn j=1 - 0 emission from 52 galaxies , and only one galaxy was not detected .",
    "table 1 lists all 53 sources , along with some basic properties of the galaxies useful for our observations and data analysis .",
    "the nearest large galaxies that require mapping to estimate the total hcn emission are highlighted in boldface in table  1 , and the detailed observational results of these galaxies will be discussed separately ( y. gao & p.m. solomon 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "seven uligs are marked with a star symbol in table  1 .",
    "our hcn survey sample also contains essentially a statistically complete sample for northern ( @xmath22 ) galaxies with @xmath23 jy , which includes about 30 of the brightest galaxies .    for the purpose of the detailed statistical analysis to be presented in paper ii , we included almost all hcn data available in the literature where the total hcn emission from galaxies can be estimated to augment our sample .",
    "there are about a dozen mostly ir - luminous galaxies with total hcn emission measured , almost entirely from solomon ( 1992 ) , but m51 and ngc  4945 are from nguyen - q - rieu ( 1992 ) and henkel ( 1990 ) , respectively . even with these supplements and those intentionally added uligs , the survey sample is not severely biased toward the high ir luminosity end .",
    "as shown in figure  1a , although most of our sample galaxies are ir bright or the brightest in the local universe , more than half have ir luminosities less than @xmath24 , and among them most have @xmath25 . there seems to be a slight bias , however , toward high co luminosity galaxies ( fig .",
    "1b ) , , more co - luminous or molecular gas - rich galaxies have been selected .",
    "this bias mainly arises because most normal spiral galaxies selected are co bright and quite rich in molecular gas , and essentially all ligs and uligs have high co luminosities .",
    "nevertheless , the galaxy number distribution in hcn luminosity appears to be rather unbiased with comparable numbers of galaxies with both low and high hcn luminosities , and the entire hcn luminosity distribution covers a large range of almost 3 orders of magnitude ( fig .",
    "we used the former nrao 12 m telescope at kitt peak and the iram 30 m telescope at pico veleta near granada , spain , for most of our hcn observations .",
    "the fcrao 14 m telescope with the 15 element focal - plane array receiver , quarry ( a configuration of three rows of five beams with a row spacing of @xmath26 and a beam spacing of @xmath27 ) , was initially used for mapping some of the nearest strong sources .",
    "we conducted several observing runs at each telescope from 1993 april to 1995 december .",
    "additional observations were conducted remotely at the nrao 12 m telescope in 1997 may and june to confirm some weak detections and to further improve the signal - to - noise ratios for some hcn spectra .",
    "the system temperatures at the redshifted hcn line frequencies were typically 220 , 250 , and 500 k on average on the antenna temperature scales of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath29 for the nrao , iram and fcrao telescopes , respectively .",
    "we converted the observed antenna temperature to the main - beam temperature scale ( @xmath30 ) for all our observations at different telescopes .",
    "table 2 lists various telescope beam efficiencies measured at different telescopes at both the 2.6 and 3.4 mm wavebands . at @xmath31 mm",
    ", we adopted the continuum sensitivity ( the temperature - to - flux conversion for a point source ) on the @xmath30 scale as @xmath32 , 29.0 , and 23.5 jy k@xmath33 for the iram 30 m , nrao 12 m , and fcrao 14 m telescopes , respectively .    at the iram 30 m , we used two 512 @xmath34 1 mhz filter banks and the autocorrelator in its widest bandwidth configuration as back ends .",
    "these back ends were connected to three sis receivers ( 3 mm , 2 mm , 1 mm ) that were usually used to simultaneously observe hcn j=1 - 0 , cs ( 3 - 2 ) , and co j=2 - 1 lines respectively .",
    "the telescope beam diameters ( fwhm ) for co j=1 - 0 and hcn j=1 - 0 were @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the nrao 12 m was equipped with dual - polarization 3 mm sis receivers .",
    "we connected the dual receivers to a pair of @xmath37 mhz filter banks as well as the two 600 mhz wide hybrid spectrometers .",
    "the telescope beam diameters ( fwhm ) for co j=1 - 0 and hcn j=1 - 0 were 55@xmath38 and 72@xmath38 , respectively . at the fcrao 14 m ,",
    "the corresponding back ends for the 15 cooled schottky diode mixers of the quarry array were 15 spectrometers of @xmath39 mhz bandwidth .",
    "the telescope beam spacing of @xmath27 within each row of quarry is about the beam size ( fwhm ) of the 14 m telescope at 3 mm .",
    "the iram 30 m telescope used a wobbling secondary with a beam throw of @xmath40 to achieve flat baselines .",
    "similarly , a nutating subreflector with a chop rate of @xmath41 hz was used at the nrao 12 m together with a position switch ( the so - called beam - switch plus position - switch , or `` bsp mode '' ) .",
    "the beam throws used were in the range of @xmath42 to @xmath43 ( the larger beam throw was used for nearest large galaxies with @xmath44 ) .",
    "thus , the separations between the off reference positions and the on source position are in the range of @xmath45 to @xmath46 . for a couple of the largest galaxies ( @xmath47 ) observed at the 12 m , we employed position switching in azimuth with offsets comparable to the expected co source sizes to ensure that the reference positions are completely outside of the sources observed .",
    "at the fcrao 14 m , we used double - position switching in azimuth with offsets comparable to the diameters of galaxies .",
    "the quarry receivers of the fcrao 14 m telescope were efficient in mapping the co emission in the inner disks of nearby galaxies , but the sensitivity achievable limited our extensive mapping of the weak hcn emission outside the nuclear regions .",
    "no additional beams except for the central beam and sometimes the adjacent two inner beams were detected in hcn with the 14 m .",
    "therefore , most of the hcn mapping was eventually conducted with the 12 m and 30 m telescopes after the initial trial observing runs with the quarry at the fcrao 14 m",
    ".    we mainly used the iram 30 m to observe most ( rather distant ) uligs in the sample and to map some nearby starburst galaxies of mostly smaller optical diameters , given the smaller telescope beam compared with the source size and extent for achieving effective mapping .",
    "essentially all other observations were conducted with the nrao 12 m so that one beam measurement covered all emission from relatively distant galaxies including some interacting / merging galaxy pairs .",
    "almost all nearby spiral galaxies were mapped along the major axes with the nrao 12 m .",
    "these 12 m observations included both the hcn observations initially attempted with the fcrao 14 m quarry array , and in several cases , the major axis mapping observations from the iram 30 m in order to properly compare the total hcn emission estimated with different telescopes ( see table  3 ) .",
    "this is essential to better characterize the radial hcn distribution in galaxies ( y. gao & p.m. solomon 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "all observed positions were chosen by checking and comparing the positions of the peak radio continuum emission as determined from the vla snapshot survey ( condon 1990 ) or the best positions ( with uncertainties @xmath48 ) then listed in the ned .",
    "the observed spectra from all telescopes ( except for the fcrao 14 m ) were smoothed to @xmath128 mhz resolution , or @xmath49 and @xmath50 at 2.6 and 3.4 mm , respectively .",
    "occasionally , in several of the weakest hcn sources , the spectra were smoothed to 16 mhz to boost the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "linear baselines were removed from the spectra after emission line windows were chosen to estimate the integrated line intensities .",
    "we converted the line temperatures to the main - beam brightness temperature scale @xmath30 ( tables  2 and 3 ) .",
    "in many cases , co lines were also observed from the same telescope for comparison and for determination of the hcn line emission windows .",
    "all hcn observations of galaxies so far have shown that the significantly detected hcn line profiles have the same line widths as the co lines ( , solomon 1992 ; helfer & blitz 1993 ; gao 1996 ) . with the co spectra obtained from the same positions or available in the literature from the same telescope , the integrated line intensities of the weakly detected hcn lines can be more accurately estimated .",
    "calibrations at all three telescopes were done using the standard chopper wheel method ( kutner & ulich 1981 ) .",
    "the absolute antenna temperature scale was checked by either observing the standard calibration sources or by the measured co line strengths of the targets ( mostly for the nearest strong sources ) as compared with the standard spectra at the telescopes and the known co spectra available in the literature .",
    "pointing was checked by observing quasars or planets about every 23 hours , with typical errors of @xmath51 for the iram 30 m , and @xmath52  10@xmath38  for the nrao",
    "12 m and the fcrao 14 m .",
    "focus was also monitored a few times per day mostly using planets .",
    "more detailed discussions of the observations and the antenna temperature scales at different telescopes can be found in gao ( 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "we present all hcn spectra in figs .  2 and 3 for the iram 30 m and the nrao 12 m telescopes , respectively , including a few weak ( @xmath53 ) detections .",
    "for most galaxies , we also show the co spectra taken at the same position from the same telescope for comparison . a few co spectra in figure  2 , however , are co j=2 - 1 lines , which have much smaller beam sizes compared with that of the hcn j=1 - 0 spectra . in some cases ,",
    "the velocity range of co emission , obtained from the published co spectra in the literature with the same telescopes or comparable telescope beam sizes , is indicated instead .",
    "ngc  253 , ngc  2903 , m82 , and ngc  6946 were mapped by both the iram 30 m and the nrao 12 m and therefore appear in both figs .  2 and 3 . only the central hcn spectra of those nearby galaxies highlighted in table  1 are displayed here ; the detailed hcn mapping will be shown in a future paper ( y. gao & p.m. solomon 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "we detected hcn emission in essentially all of the sources ( except ngc  1055 ) listed in table  1 , though a few galaxies were only marginally detected .",
    "the observed line intensities ( of both hcn and co if applicable ) are listed in table  3 together with other measured quantities useful for analysis .",
    "the derived global properties of the line luminosities and their ratios using methods discussed below (  4.2 ) are listed in table  4 .",
    "fully sampled mapping is essential in order to estimate the total hcn emission in large spiral galaxies ( gao 1996 , 1997 ; y. gao & p.m. solomon 2004 , in preparation ) because a substantial fraction of the total hcn emission is distributed outside the @xmath54 kpc nuclear regions ( which are covered by the central beams in these observations ) .",
    "therefore , we did not add more nearby galaxies with hcn detections from their centers from the literature into our hcn sample .",
    "those data only measure lower limits to the hcn luminosity since only the central beam detections were made for these nearby large spiral galaxies , and the hcn emission outside the central @xmath54 kpc nuclear regions is unknown .",
    "notice that about 15% of the galaxies in our hcn survey sample also have either upper or lower limits in the total hcn emission or luminosity ( tables  3 & 4 ) .",
    "the upper limits in the hcn measurements correspond to weak detections ( @xmath55 ) or non - detections ( @xmath56 , only for ngc  1055 ) or to nearby galaxies with good detections in the center but with only weak detections or non - detections at the off - center positions .",
    "the lower limits in the hcn luminosity are for a few nearby galaxies with good hcn detections from the galaxy centers , but no systematic mapping or detections at off - center positions ( ngc  2903 is exceptional since it was mapped with the iram 30 m , yet more sensitive and extensive mapping is still required to estimate the total hcn emission ) .",
    "this is similar to the case of more than a dozen nearby galaxies with only central beam hcn observations in the literature ( thus lower limits to the total hcn emission ) .",
    "we include our own limits , but not the hcn limits in the literature in the final hcn sample .      for sources much smaller than the telescope beam , the hcn luminosity is calculated using @xmath57 ( see solomon 1997 for details , @xmath58 with a unit of k  pc@xmath59 is introduced to distinguish it from normal @xmath60 , which has proper power units ) , where @xmath61 is the solid angle subtended by the source area , @xmath62\\ ] ] is the observed integrated line intensity ( as converted to the beam - diluted main - beam temperature scale ) , @xmath63 is the intrinsic source brightness temperature , @xmath64 is the solid angle of the source convolved with the diameter ( fwhm ) of the telescope gaussian beam @xmath65 , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the luminosity distance=75  mpc@xmath33 and @xmath68 were used in this paper ] and the angular size distance to the source , respectively , related by @xmath69 $ ]  mpc .    for large galaxies where hcn was observed at several positions along the major axis , the total integrated hcn flux over the source , @xmath70 is estimated following the empirical formula adopted in solomon & sage ( 1988 ; also sage 1987 ) to calculate the total co emission .",
    "the total hcn emission is obtained by summing all the measured line fluxes along the major axes with weights determined from considerations of @xmath65 , the ( source ) disk size , @xmath71 , and the disk inclination , and assumption of an axisymmetric source distribution .",
    "thus , for nearby galaxies , @xmath72    the co luminosity is calculated similarly with the same formula listed above ( switching hcn with co ) . for brevity",
    ", we hereafter use the symbol @xmath60 rather than @xmath58 for the line luminosity in unit of k  pc@xmath59 for both co and hcn emission .",
    "for those nearby galaxies that we observed with different telescopes , the agreement in the estimated total hcn fluxes is rather good ( table 3 ) , given the weak hcn lines detected outside the nuclear regions in most cases .",
    "for all positions observed in hcn , the permitted velocity ranges are available either from our own , or published , co observations . as discussed in   3 ,",
    "the weak detections or upper limits for the hcn line intensities can be better estimated when the hcn line emission windows are known / assumed from the co lines , and thus the hcn results are rather robust .",
    "the uncertainties in the total hcn ( and occasionally co ) luminosities are up to @xmath73 including the calibration errors of different telescopes , but in most cases only @xmath74 or better .",
    "the largest uncertainties are only present in a few galaxies with the marginal detections ( @xmath55 ) and in some nearby large galaxies with very limited points observed where extensive mapping along their major axes is still required for more accurate estimates of the total hcn emission .",
    "figure  4 shows a tight linear correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 over 3 orders of magnitude in ir luminosity .",
    "the originally proposed correlation , based on 10 representative galaxies ( solomon 1992 ) , is also noted for comparison .",
    "we recalculated ,   ( see $ 4.2 ) based on the measured line intensities @xmath75 and @xmath76 listed in table  1 of solomon ( 1992 ) .",
    "obviously , the new hcn data from a sample more than 5 times larger closely follow the trend established by solomon ( 1992 ) and have about the same scatters .",
    "a least  squares fit including published data ( almost entirely from solomon 1992 ) , yet excluding our hcn limits , yields a slope of 1.00 @xmath77 0.05 , with a correlation coefficient r=0.94 ( r@xmath78 ) .",
    "the correlation implies @xmath79 .",
    "when we include all galaxies in the fit and take the limits given in table 4 as the hcn luminosities , the linear relation remains almost the same with   @xmath80   and the same correlation coefficient .    we have therefore confirmed the tight correlation between ir and hcn luminosities in a large , statistically significant sample .",
    "ligs / uligs have the highest @xmath1 and highest ratio of / , and many of them have @xmath1 even larger than @xmath81 of the milky way , which implies a relatively high fraction of dense molecular gas as well as an extremely large reservoir of dense molecular gas ( discussed further in   4.5 ) .",
    "the detailed discussion of the tight correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 and other relationships , as well as their implications , will be fully explored in paper ii . in this paper",
    ", we would like to show that hcn emission is indeed a good tracer of dense molecular gas ( in the next two sections ) .",
    "therefore , the tight correlation between far - ir and hcn suggests that active star formation is strongly related to the mass of dense molecular gas and the main source of the strong ir emission in ligs / uligs is mostly from active star formation .    in figure 5",
    ", we have divided the sample into two subsamples : ligs and uligs with @xmath82 are plotted as filled circles , and less luminous galaxies are shown as open circles .",
    "apparently , all ligs / uligs have   larger than 10@xmath83  , whereas the less luminous normal spiral galaxies have @xmath84  .",
    "we also note that several uligs have /   as high as @xmath85 , whereas most normal galaxies have /   nearly 10 times smaller .",
    "other systematic differences between these two subsamples can also be easily seen in various other correlations presented in paper ii .",
    "we here try to empirically demonstrate that the radiative pumping , or populating , of the j=1 level of hcn through a vibrational transition at 14  @xmath2 m wavelength , does not enhance significantly the excitation of the hcn j=1 - 0 emission .",
    "since the mid - ir vibrational transition of hcn falls within the 12  @xmath2 m bandpass and there are no other direct measurements of the 14  @xmath2 m emission available , we use the 12  @xmath2 m flux as an approximation .",
    "we show in figure  5 two correlation plots that involve the 12  @xmath2 m emission to illustrate that the enhancement in the excitation of hcn through a vibrational transition , by this potential mid - ir radiative pumping , as postulated by aalto ( 1995 ) , is not important .",
    "previous hcn modeling also found that the radiative pumping from the dust continuum emission has little effect on the excitation of the rotational transitions in the vibrational ground state of hcn ( e.g. , stutzki 1988 ; paglione , jackson , & ishizuki 1997 ) .",
    "although there is still a good correlation between the 12 @xmath2 m and hcn emission ( a squared correlation coefficient of r@xmath86 ) , the relationship is not particularly strong as compared with the much tighter correlation between ir and hcn emission ( fig .  4 , r@xmath78 ) .",
    "in fact , the correlation between the 12@xmath2 m and hcn emission appears to be the weakest among the correlations between the four waveband and hcn emission .",
    "both the 60 and 100@xmath2 m luminosities correlate much better with the hcn luminosity . for example",
    ", the correlation between 100@xmath2 m and hcn emission ( r@xmath87 ) is significantly better than that between 12@xmath2 m and hcn emission ( r@xmath86 )",
    ". a three - parameter fit of hcn emission as a function of both 12@xmath2 m and 100@xmath2 m emission clearly shows that most of the contribution to the fit is from the 100@xmath2 m emission alone , whereas there is little from the 12@xmath2 m emission .",
    "should the mid - ir pumping be an important effect in the excitation of hcn in the vibrational ground state of hcn , a tighter correlation between the 12@xmath2 m and hcn luminosities than any correlations between the hcn and 60@xmath2 m , 100@xmath2 m , and total ir luminosities would be expected .",
    "we observe the contrary .",
    "we can also use the luminosity ratio , rather than the single luminosity alone , to normalize the correlations in order to eliminate the distance and galaxy size dependencies inherent in the luminosity correlations ( more examples are in paper ii ) .",
    "there is only a weak correlation between @xmath88 and /  ( r@xmath89 ) , whereas the correlation between @xmath90 and /   is still fairly strong ( r@xmath91 ) . clearly , these results suggest that the mid - ir emission is only loosely correlated with the hcn emission , and the correlation between the far - ir emission and the hcn emission is significantly tighter in comparison .",
    "this essentially rules out the possibility that the mid - ir pumping in the vibrational ground state of hcn could be one of the significant contributors to the hcn j=1 - 0 emissivity .    to strengthen these results",
    ", we compare the hcn luminosity and the ratio of hcn and co luminosities ( / ) with the excess 12  @xmath2 m emission estimated by either the ratio of 12@xmath2 m and total ir or the ratio of 12@xmath2 m and 100@xmath2 m ( or 12@xmath2 m and 60@xmath2 m ) luminosities .",
    "we plot the luminosity ratio of @xmath92 versus   in figure  5a and the luminosity ratios of /   versus @xmath93 in figure  5b .",
    "obviously , no correlations are observed in these plots and there is no sign of increased hcn emission or an increased /   ratio for galaxies with a 12  @xmath2 m emission excess .",
    "similar plots for relationships between the luminosity ratios of /   and @xmath92 or between /   and @xmath94 show no correlations either .",
    "therefore , there is little evidence for a direct connection between the 12  @xmath2 m and hcn emission , even for galaxies with excessive 12  @xmath2 m emission ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "the contribution of mid - ir radiative pumping to the hcn excitation must be negligible when it is compared to the collisional excitation by dense molecular hydrogen ( see   4.5 ) .",
    "gao & solomon ( paper ii ) show that   can be quite accurately predicted from the ir ( or far - ir ) and co luminosities . in this three - parameter model fit ,   appears to be slightly more important , but   is also a significant predictor for .",
    "here we can add @xmath95 as an additional parameter into the model fit for   to check whether @xmath95 is a non - negligible predictor for   as well .",
    "this could test the significance of the mid - ir emission contribution to hcn as compared with that of the far - ir and co emission .",
    "we find that the model fit changes only marginally with no improvement in the correlation coefficient or the rms scatter of the fit .",
    "in fact , no difference is noticeable in the model fit whether @xmath95 is added or not .",
    "therefore , even though there exists a correlation between 12@xmath2 m and hcn emission , the correlation is significantly worse than the correlations between the hcn and ir emission of three other bands , and the contribution to hcn from 12  @xmath2 m emission is negligible .",
    "we conclude that there is no clear evidence to claim that the mid - ir pumping can significantly enhance the hcn emission .    for the archetypal agn / starburst hybrid galaxy ngc  1068 , which has the strongest mid - ir emission in our hcn sample , the /   ratio is also one of the highest .",
    "in particular , a very high hcn / co ratio ( @xmath96 ) within @xmath97  pc nuclear region is observed ( jackson 1993 ; tacconi 1994 ; helfer & blitz 1995 ) in the interferometric maps , which appears to be the mid - ir compact core around agn ( le floch 2001 ) .",
    "is this an example that the mid - ir pumping has significantly enhanced the global hcn emission ?",
    "apparently not , since the innermost @xmath98100  pc nuclear region around the agn contributes little to the average hcn / co ratios in the circumnuclear ( @xmath990.51  kpc ) starburst ring where most of molecular gas is located .",
    "also in ngc  1068 , the ratio @xmath100 is much higher than in any other galaxy in the sample .",
    "yet , it is still not certain whether the extreme excess of the mid - ir emission contributes significantly to the excitation of hcn .",
    "this is because galaxies with the lowest @xmath92 ratios can have even larger hcn luminosities than ngc  1068 ( fig .",
    "5a ) and galaxies with the lowest @xmath101 ratios appear to have similar or even higher /   ratios than ngc  1068 ( fig .",
    "thus , globally the high /   ratio and high   in galaxies may have nothing to do with the mid - ir emission excess . again",
    ", there is no indication that the strong mid - ir emission is linked to the high ratio of hcn / co or large hcn luminosity even for galaxies with the most extreme mid - ir emission excesses .",
    "the mass of molecular gas in galaxies is typically derived from the co luminosity using the `` standard '' co - to - h@xmath102 conversion factor @xmath103 ( , solomon & barrett 1991 ; young & scoville 1991 and references therein ) , estimated from the galactic disk gmcs in the milky way .",
    "although this conversion corresponds to @xmath104 @xmath105 ( k ) @xmath33 , rather than the recent calibration of @xmath106 @xmath105 ( k ) @xmath33 ( dame 2001 ; hunter 1997 ) , we use it simply for easy comparison with previous co studies of galaxies .",
    "as discussed in downes , solomon , & radford ( 1993 ) , solomon ( 1997 ) , and downes & solomon ( 1998 ) , however , we caution that it might overestimate the molecular gas mass in uligs by factors of 35 .",
    "unlike normal spiral galaxies , where a large fraction of co emission comes mainly from gmcs distributed in the inner disk , the co distribution in uligs is extremely concentrated in the nuclear regions and may fill the entire volume since even the intercloud medium may be molecular ( solomon 1997 ; downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "high - resolution co imaging of uligs has indeed shown extremely high concentration of co emission in the central few hundred parsecs ( , downes & solomon 1998 ) . for uligs ,",
    "the conversion factor is thus lower than for normal spiral galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , we still adopt the standard co - to - h@xmath102 gas mass conversion ( eq . [ 5 ] ) for convenience since 90% of the galaxies in our sample are not uligs .",
    "the ratio of /m(h@xmath102 ) , often referred to as the star formation efficiency , is also listed in table  4 .",
    "observations of h@xmath107cn ( nguyen - q - rieu 1992 ; wild 1992 ) indicate that extragalactic hcn emission is also optically thick , just like co emission .",
    "the conversion factor between hcn and the mass of the dense molecular gas , however , is poorly constrained as there is no direct calibration from gmcs or gmc core regions in the disk of the milky way . from observations of higher transition cs emission ,",
    "plume ( 1997 ) find a typical gmc core has a diameter of 1  pc and mass of 3800 .",
    "then the rms velocity of a virialized cloud with these parameters is @xmath108  , consistent with the observed fwhm line width .",
    "we have carried out large velocity gradient ( lvg ) calculations that include radiative trapping for hcn j=1 - 0 to determine the mass of dense molecular gas from the measured hcn brightness temperatures ( , kwan & scoville 1975 ) , using the collision rates given by green & thaddeus ( 1974 ) .",
    "for an hcn abundance ( relative to h@xmath102 ) of @xmath109 ( , irvine , goldsmith , & hjalmarson 1987 ; lahuis & van dishoeck 2000 ) and a velocity gradient of @xmath108  pc@xmath33 , this gives [ hcn]/@xmath110  pc@xmath111 .",
    "for a kinetic temperature of 2050  k and the intrinsic hcn line brightness temperature @xmath112 5 k , this gives @xmath113 @xmath105 ( k ) @xmath33 or @xmath114 for h@xmath102 at a density  @xmath115  @xmath5 , where @xmath116(h@xmath102 ) means the dense molecular gas as traced by hcn emission , and @xmath117 is the optical depth of the hcn j=1 - 0 line .    for higher intrinsic hcn line brightness temperature",
    "@xmath118  k , higher gas density n(h@xmath10",
    "@xmath5 , and the same abundance and velocity gradient , however , lvg results give @xmath119 @xmath105 ( k ) @xmath33 , or @xmath120    alternatively , for a virialized cloud core of an average density @xmath121 @xmath5 and @xmath122 35 k ( , radford , solomon , & downes 1991 ) , @xmath123 almost same as that obtained from lvg approximation ( eq . [ 7 ] ) .",
    "the lvg calculations above give perhaps an upper limit for the conversion factor between hcn and the mass of dense molecular gas ( cf . mauersberger & henkel 1993 ) since the much lower intrinsic hcn line brightness temperature @xmath124 or 15  k was used besides other approximations in the lvg estimates .",
    "higher @xmath125 indeed tends to result in a smaller conversion factor allowed by lvg ( eq . [ 7 ] ) .",
    "hcn hot cores in regions of massive star formation usually have extremely high temperature up to hundreds of degrees ( e.g. , boonman 2001 ) .",
    "thus , it is likely that a much smaller conversion factor holds under these extreme conditions .",
    "moreover , there are some other mechanisms possible to help excite hcn molecule , , excess hcn abundance ( bergin , snell , & goldsmith 1996 ; lahuis & van dishoeck 2000 ) resulting from the active star - forming environment and high supernovae events , and collisions with electrons .",
    "although these are most likely insignificant ( , mid - ir radiative pumping discussed in previous section ) and the dominant mechanism should still be collisions with molecular hydrogen , they could work collectively to lower the conversion factor given in equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "other constraints such as the total molecular gas mass estimated from the co observations , the higher frequency co line observations , and the dynamical mass estimations ( , solomon 1997 ; downes & solomon 1998 ) , all seem to point to a smaller conversion factor , particularly for ligs / uligs .",
    "thus , a lower conversion factor given in equation ( 8) is more likely .",
    "in fact , since the luminosity ratio /   in uligs can be as large as @xmath126 ( , mrk  231 , mrk  273 and 17208 - 0014 ) , the true conversion factor between hcn and the mass of dense molecular gas should obviously be much smaller than the upper limit allowed by the lvg calculation ( eq . [ 7 ] ) in order to reconcile with the total molecular gas mass estimated from the standard co - to - h@xmath102 conversion ( eq . [ 5 ] ) . particularly for uligs , even equation",
    "( 8) might still overestimate the dense molecular gas mass since @xmath125 could be indeed very high ( @xmath127  k ) and the standard co - to - h@xmath102 conversion of equation ( 5 ) should be reduced by a factor of 5 in uligs ( downes & solomon 1998 ) . the main difference between normal spiral galaxies and uligs in the hcn - to - h@xmath102 conversion , however , is the drastically different molecular line brightness temperatures . while @xmath128  k is valid for most normal spiral galaxies , a factor of 5 higher  @xmath129  k   was deduced for uligs undergoing extreme starbursts ( downes & solomon 1998 ) , which argues for a much lower hcn - to - h@xmath102 conversion factor than those given in the above equations .",
    "nevertheless , this also indicates that uligs with the highest /   ratio are likely to have most ( @xmath130 ) of their molecular gas at high density ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) and that /   ratio can indeed be used as an indicator of the fraction of dense molecular gas in galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , /   ratio also indicates the average molecular gas density in galaxies .",
    "given the large uncertainty of the hcn - to - h@xmath102 conversion , the same as is true for co - to - h@xmath102 conversion , we suggest that a conversion factor of @xmath131 ( eq . [ 8 ] ) is the more reasonable one to use , and we adopt this relation to estimate the total dense molecular gas mass in galaxies as tabulated for /@xmath132 in table  4 .",
    "accurate determination of the conversion factor between hcn and the mass of dense molecular gas needs further extensive studies including higher frequency hcn observations ( , jackson 1995 ; paglione 1997 ) and more detailed modeling .",
    "we present systematic hcn j=1 - 0 observations ( complemented with co observations ) of a sample of 53 ir / co - bright and/or luminous galaxies , which is the largest hcn sample and most sensitive hcn survey of external galaxies so far .",
    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies have the highest hcn luminosities , usually several times larger than the co luminosity of our own galaxy .",
    "many luminous infrared galaxies have hcn luminosities comparable to the co luminosity of the galaxy",
    ". the ratio of hcn and co luminosities can be as large as @xmath126 in ultraluminous infrared galaxies , nearly an order of magnitude higher than most normal spiral galaxies .",
    "we compared the hcn line emission with the far - ir emission ( an indicator of the rate of high - mass ob star formation ) .",
    "all galaxies surveyed follow the tight correlation between ir and hcn luminosities initially proposed by solomon ( 1992 ) . since stars form only in dense clouds and the hcn - emitting gas ( i.e. , the dense molecular gas ) and ir emission appear closely and physically related , then active star formation is the dominant source of ir emission in luminous and ultraluminous galaxies .",
    "this is fully discussed in paper ii .",
    "there is no particularly strong correlation between the 12 @xmath2 m and hcn luminosities .",
    "the correlations between 100 @xmath2 m ( and 60 @xmath2 m ) and hcn emission are much better correlated in comparison .",
    "galaxies with excess 12 @xmath2 m emission do not show stronger hcn emission or higher hcn / co luminosity ratios .",
    "thus , mid - ir radiative pumping of hcn excitation is of little significance when compared with the collisional excitation by dense molecular gas .",
    "we also discussed the use of hcn j=1 - 0 emission as a tracer of higher density molecular gas ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) and adopted a hcn - to - h@xmath102 conversion factor @xmath133  ( k  pc@xmath134 . luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies usually have much higher hcn brightness temperature , which might result in a lower conversion factor .",
    "analyses including lvg calculations indicate that the hcn luminosity measures the mass of dense molecular gas and the hcn / co luminosity ratio indicates the fraction of molecular gas in a dense phase .",
    "we thank simon radford , dennis downes , and mark heyer for help with some of the observations .",
    "we appreciate the generous support and allocation of observing time from the nrao 12 m , the iram 30 m , and the fcrao 14 m .",

    "<S> we report systematic hcn j=1 - 0 ( and co ) observations of a sample of 53 infrared ( ir ) and/or co - bright and/or luminous galaxies , including seven ultraluminous infrared galaxies , nearly 20 luminous infrared galaxies , and more than a dozen of the nearest normal spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this is the largest and most sensitive hcn survey of galaxies to date . </S>",
    "<S> all galaxies observed so far follow the tight correlation between the ir luminosity @xmath0 and the hcn luminosity @xmath1 initially proposed by solomon , downes , & radford , which is detailed in a companion paper . </S>",
    "<S> we also address here the issue of hcn excitation . </S>",
    "<S> there is no particularly strong correlation between @xmath1 and the 12@xmath2 m luminosity ; in fact , of all the four bands , the 12@xmath2 m luminosity has the weakest correlation with the hcn luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> there is also no evidence of stronger hcn emission or a higher ratio of hcn and co luminosities @xmath3 for galaxies with excess 12@xmath2 m emission . </S>",
    "<S> this result implies that mid - ir radiative pumping , or populating , of the j=1 level of hcn by a mid - ir vibrational transition is not important compared with the collisional excitation by dense molecular hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , large velocity gradient calculations justify the use of hcn j=1 - 0 emission as a tracer of high - density molecular gas ( @xmath4  @xmath5 ) and give an estimate of the mass of dense molecular gas from hcn observations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath1 may be used as a measure of the total mass of dense molecular gas , and the luminosity ratio @xmath3 may indicate the fraction of molecular gas that is dense .    </S>",
