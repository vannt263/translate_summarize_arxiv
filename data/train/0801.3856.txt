    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary stars in which a white dwarf primary accretes matter via roche lobe overflow from a secondary , which usually resembles a lower main - sequence star @xcite . in most cvs an accretion disk encircles the white dwarf",
    ". optical emission can come from several locations in the system .",
    "the gas stream from the secondary star strikes the outer rim of the accretion disk producing a rapidly fluctuating bright spot ( or hot spot ) .",
    "the accretion disk often dominates the light , and instabilities in the disk can produce large variations in the system brightness .",
    "strong white - dwarf magnetic fields can truncate or even entirely disrupt the accretion disk , allowing material to fall directly onto the white dwarf .",
    "in many systems the accumulated hydrogen - rich material can undergo a thermonuclear runaway , creating a classical nova outburst .",
    "the range of phenomena seen in cvs means that determining the subclass of any example can require extensive photometric and spectroscopic study .",
    "h. h. lanning ( @xcite and subsequent papers ) conducted a search for ultraviolet - bright ( uv ) sources in the galactic plane by visually examining plates taken with the palomar oschin schmidt .",
    "to date , six supplements have been published , revealing a total of 724 uv sources .",
    "six of these are included in the _ catalog and atlas of cataclysmic variables _ @xcite as confirmed or suspected cvs ; they are listed in table [ lanningtable ] .",
    "@xcite presented a spectrum of lanning 386 which showed apparent cv features  a blue continuum , he i absorption lines , and broad balmer emission lines",
    ". the extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations we present here establish that lanning  386 is indeed a deeply - eclipsing cv with @xmath3 d. intriguingly , it shares characteristics of both the dwarf novae ",
    "cvs that undergo occasional eruptions thought to be caused by a disk instability  and the sw sextantis stars @xcite , a subclass of the persistently - bright novalike variables .",
    "we began routine monitoring of lanning 386 on 2005 june 25 , with a 0.25 m robotic survey telescope at the lead author s private observatory in southern new hampshire .",
    "the system was programmed to automatically monitor a list of poorly - studied cv candidates and to initiate time series photometry if and when an outburst was detected .",
    "the first outburst of lanning 386 was detected 2005 september 12 ut , after eleven weeks of monitoring .",
    "time series observations ( detailed in table [ photsumtable ] ) began immediately , and revealed two eclipses separated by @xmath4 hr , about 1.5 mag deep .",
    "thereafter , time series observations were obtained every clear night for 5 months in 2005 and another 5 months in 2006 , yielding over 3,000 photometric observations .",
    "a 0.4 m telescope at the same observatory was used along with the 0.25 m , and all observations were unfiltered due to the star s faintness .",
    "integration times were 300 sec with the 0.25 m telescope and 180 sec with the 0.4 m. all images were bias subtracted and flat - field corrected .",
    "ensemble photometry was performed using 12 relatively isolated comparison stars .",
    "we established a rough zero point using @xmath5 magnitudes of four of these stars ( figure [ finder_wide ] ) measured with the mdm 2.4 m telescope ( see below ) ; table [ cmptable ] gives their positions and magnitudes .",
    "the mean scatter of the differential photometry was @xmath6 percent .",
    "the unfiltered photometry has a significant color term , and the zero points of the two filter photometry sessions described below were slightly discrepant , so we estimate the uncertainty in the photometric zero point to be @xmath7 mag .    our filter photometry is from the 2.4 m hiltner telescope at mdm observatory on kitt peak .",
    "a @xmath8 site ccd detector , cropped to @xmath9 to minimize read time , gave a 4.7 arcmin square field of view .",
    "we obtained single sets of short ( 60 - 120 s ) exposures through @xmath10 filters on 2005 september 15 and 2007 june 24 ut , measured them using the iraf implementation of daophot @xcite , and derived transformations to the johnson / cousins photometric system using observations of @xcite standard - star fields .",
    "the zero points for the two sets of observations differed by @xmath11 mag in @xmath5 .",
    "the 2005 september 15 observations show lanning 386 at @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , while the 2007 june 24 observation yields @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "our spectra come from three different instruments on two different telescopes , as listed in table [ specjournal ] .",
    "our most extensive spectroscopy is from the hiltner telescope , equipped with the mdm modular spectrograph , a 600 line mm@xmath20 grating , and the same @xmath8 site detector used for the filter photometry .",
    "the modspec observations were taken by one of us ( jrt ) without awareness that eclipses had been discovered , and were therefore aimed largely at determining @xmath0 .",
    "the spectra cover from 4200 to 7500   , with 2 pixel@xmath20 sampling and @xmath21   resolution ( fwhm ) .",
    "the observing and reduction procedures were as described in @xcite .",
    "we also obtained time - series spectra of lanning  386 in its bright state using the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) mayall 4 m telescope and rc spectrograph .",
    "the t2 kb ccd detector , kpc10a grating , and a 1  arcsec slit provided an average dispersion of 2.8   pixel@xmath20 and a useful range between 3700 and 8000  , with some order overlap beyond 7400  .",
    "the slit was rotated to the parallactic angle to prevent differential slit losses .",
    "the spectra were bias subtracted , flat - field corrected using images of an internal quartz lamp , extracted using the iraf _ twodspec _ package , and wavelength calibrated against henear lamp exposures taken from time to time as the telescope tracked .",
    "we applied a flux calibration derived from observations of the spectrophotometric standard bd + 28@xmath22 4211 .",
    "finally , we have two 600-s exposures of lanning  386 taken during twilight on 2006 dec 8 ut , using the mdm hiltner telescope and osu boller and chivens ccd spectrograph ( ccds ) .",
    "the spectra were reduced in the same way as the kpno data described above .",
    "the 5000 - 6000   continuum is @xmath23 mag fainter than in the kpno spectra , confirming that the system was in quiescence .",
    "table [ eclipsestable ] lists the observed times of mid - eclipse .",
    "these yield a unique ephemeris , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an integer and the parentheses give uncertainties in the last digits .",
    "radial velocities of the h@xmath26 emission line ( discussed below ) give essentially the same period , namely 0.1640530(11 ) d , without ambiguity caused by uncertainty in the number of cycles elapsed between observing runs .",
    "all phases in this paper refer to the eclipse ephemeris .      in figures [ quietobplot ] and [ outburstplot ]",
    "we show representative lights curves in quiescence and outburst , constructed by folding two consecutive observation sessions using the ephemeris ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn1 ] ) .",
    "the quiescent plot , from observations made between 2005 september 27 and october 1 ut , shows a pre - eclipse hump ; this feature usually arises from the `` hot spot '' where gas streaming from the secondary star strikes the disk .",
    "the hot spot contribution is not evident in the outburst plot , made from observations taken 2006 july 16 and 17 ut .",
    "the eclipse depth is roughly the same in each state .",
    "figure [ allplot ] shows all the photometry folded on the ephemeris and makes evident the long term variations in the mean magnitude .",
    "the histogram of the median magnitude for each of the dates in table [ photsumtable ] , shown in figure [ histplot ] , suggests an quiescent state near @xmath27 ( with some variability ) , an intermediate stage at @xmath28 and an outburst state at @xmath29 .",
    "this range of brightness is also evident from visual inspection of figure [ allplot ] .",

    "the absorption bands of an m dwarf are visible .",
    "we estimated the spectral class and flux contribution of the m dwarf by subtracting scaled m - dwarf library spectra from the low - state spectrum and judging how well the m - dwarf features were accounted for ; this yielded a spectral type m3.3 @xmath31 0.8 and a contribution to the total light corresponding to @xmath32 ( including estimated calibration uncertainty ) . using ( 1 ) the measured @xmath0 , ( 2 ) the condition that the secondary fill the roche lobe , and ( 3 ) a broad range of plausible secondary star masses @xmath33 ( from 0.2 to 0.5 m@xmath34 ; @xcite )",

    ", we estimate that the secondary s radius @xmath35 r@xmath34  fortunately , @xmath36 at a fixed @xmath0 depends only weakly on @xmath33 , roughly as @xmath37 . finally ,",
    "using the calibration of the relation between spectral type and @xmath5-band surface brightness given by @xcite , we estimate @xmath38 for the secondary , giving an apparent distance modulus @xmath39 . at galactic latitude @xmath40",
    "there is likely to be substantial dust extinction ; @xcite estimate that extragalactic objects in this direction undergo reddening @xmath41 .",
    "the actual reddening appears to be considerably less than this upper limit ; most dwarf novae in outburst have @xmath42 , within @xmath7 mag or so @xcite , so our outburst color suggests @xmath43 or so .",
    "if so , the nominal distance would be @xmath44 pc .",
    "the bright state kpno spectra cover both eclipse and out - of - eclipse phases . as shown in figure [ spec1plot ] , the average spectrum in the bright state shows broad balmer emission lines on a continuum that is considerably bluer than in the low state .",
    "several emission lines such as @xmath45 are clearly seen , but the strongest non - hydrogen feature is the bright @xmath46 line , which is blended with the / bowen complex .",
    "is so prominent in this star that the usually weak line at @xmath47 is also easily detected .",
    "a broad feature in the spectrum at @xmath48 is evidently a feature which is common in wolf - rayet stars , but unusual in cataclysmic variables .",
    "@xcite found the line in the old nova v840  oph and suggested the star had a carbon over - abundance .",
    "however , @xcite identified in sw  sex and attributed it to a particularly high - excitation state for the star . in eclipse ,",
    "the continuum remains blue , but its slope is greatly reduced . between 6000    and",
    "4000   the continuum rises by a factor of 2.9 ( in @xmath49 ) out of eclipse but only by a factor of 1.6 in eclipse .",
    "however , in eclipse the emission remains one of the strongest lines in the spectrum .",
    "the ratio of fluxes between @xmath50 and h@xmath51 is 1.2 out of eclipse and 0.64 during eclipse .",
    "if lanning 386 is a dwarf nova , its high - state spectrum is unusual ; we comment on this more extensively in the discussion .",
    "figure  [ singletrail ] shows phase - resolved greyscale representations of our high- and low - state spectra . to construct these ,",
    "the spectra were first divided by the continuum and cleaned of residual cosmic rays ; then for each orbital phase we averaged spectra whose phases were close to the target phase , using a gaussian in phase for the weighting function .",
    "finally , all the spectra were stacked together to form a two - dimensional image , with a second cycle repeated for continuity .",
    "we created separate images from the high - state kpno data and the low - state mdm modspec data .",
    "examination of fig .",
    "[ singletrail ] shows a host of interesting differences between the two states . in the low state ( top two panels ) , the emission lines have two approximately equal peaks , while in the high state ( lower two panels ) show more complex behavior ; in particular , phase - dependent absorption is seen in @xmath524921 , 5015 , and 5876 , and in the metal feature near @xmath53 . in h@xmath51 ( and in h@xmath26 , which is not shown here ) there is a sharp component that moves approximately in antiphase to the bulk of the line .",
    "the phasing of the sharp component s motion is approximately as expected for emission from the heated face of the secondary .",
    "the high - state image has good coverage across the eclipse at phase @xmath54 ; because the emission lines are eclipsed less strongly than the continuum , the continuum division used in this representation causes an increase in the apparent emission strength .",
    "this is artificial , but the sharp red - to - blue swing in the line s central wavelength is evidently real ( see below ) .",
    "we measured radial velocities of the h@xmath26 emission in the modspec and kpno spectra using a convolution algorithm described by @xcite and @xcite . for the low - state modspec data the convolving function consisted of positive and negative gaussians with a full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 550 km s@xmath20 , separated by 1920 km s@xmath20 , which emphasized the steep sides of the line profile .",
    "the corresponding figures for the slightly narrower line profile in the high - state data were respectively 365 and 1645 km s@xmath20 .",
    "we searched the velocity time series for periods ; this exercise independently reproduced the same period found in the eclipses , with no cycle - count ambiguity on any time scale .",
    "remarkably , the high- and low - state velocities agreed very well in phase , amplitude , and zero point , despite differences in instrumentation as well as photometric state .",
    "the modulation is accurately sinusoidal , _ except _ for a rapid swing redward and then blueward across the eclipse  the classic signature of the eclipse of a rapidly - rotating object .",
    "excluding the velocities affected by the rotational disturbance , holding @xmath55 fixed at @xmath56 d , and fitting a sinusoid of the form @xmath57 $ ] yields @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the rms scatter about the best fit .",
    "[ folvel ] shows the velocities folded on the eclipse ephemeris .",
    "the sinusoid fitted to the velocities is defined so that @xmath60 is the time at which @xmath61 crosses the system velocity @xmath62 from blue to red . if the emission lines trace the motion of the white dwarf , this must occur opposite the eclipse , at phase @xmath63 .",
    "the fitted @xmath60 corresponds to @xmath64 , or a phase lag of @xmath65 compared to this expectation .",
    "this suggests that the emission line velocities do not trace the white dwarf motion precisely .",
    "our photometry shows lanning  386 to be an active , eclipsing cv , with @xmath66 h and an eclipse depth of @xmath67 mag .",
    "monitoring over many months shows bright outbursts reaching @xmath68 from a quiescent state with @xmath69 .",
    "lanning 386 does not fit neatly into any cv subclass .",
    "the long - term variability resembles that of a dwarf nova , and at minimum light the spectrum is typical of that class .",
    "however , when most dwarf novae outburst , their balmer emission becomes very weak , and broad absorption wings appear ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; it is also unusual ( though not unknown ) for to become prominent ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the high - state spectrum seen here is very much unlike this , resembling instead that of a novalike variable .",
    "the line profiles , and the unusual strength of , are reminiscent of an sw sextantis star @xcite .",
    "in addition , lanning 386 is similar to other sw sex stars in that the emission lines are eclipsed much more shallowly than the continuum , indicating a spatially extended source .",
    "the rotational disturbance around eclipse is also seen in some other sw sex stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , other canonical sw sex characteristics are missing here .",
    "the emission line radial - velocity phase in sw sex stars lags far behind ( by @xmath70 ) the phase expected for the white dwarf motion , based on the eclipse ephemeris , but in lanning 386 the phase lag is only @xmath71 .",
    "in addition , while the lines do appear in absorption for part of the orbit , in other sw sex stars the absorption appears near phase 0.5 , whereas it appears somewhat later here .",
    "nonetheless , the unusual maximum - light spectrum suggests that we should consider carefully whether the long - term light curve in fig .",
    "[ detailplot ] forces us to classify this star as a dwarf nova .",
    "might another mechanism explain the variability in a manner more consistent with the maximum - light spectrum ?",
    "many novalike variables , and many sw sex stars in particular , are also vy scl stars  novalike variables that occasionally fade deeply for varying amounts of time , for reasons that are not entirely understood .",
    "might lanning 386 be a vy scl star masquerading as a dwarf nova ?",
    "this seems unlikely , for two reasons .",
    "first , the long - term light curves of vy scl stars tend to look quite different from those of dwarf novae  vy scl stars typically remain in a high state for months or years , and only occasionally fade by large amounts , up to 5 mag ( see examples in @xcite ) . the light curve here , by contrast ,",
    "consists of frequent , moderate - amplitude outbursts from a faint state .",
    "second , the spectra of vy scl stars in their faint states look as if accretion has nearly stopped , with the balmer emission lines typically becoming very narrow and the underlying stars becoming evident @xcite .",
    "this is very different from the essentially normal dwarf nova spectrum seen here .",
    "the dq her stars , also called intermediate polars , are magnetic systems ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; some of these undergo outbursts that at least superficially resemble dwarf nova outbursts .",
    "typically , dq her outbursts are infrequent compared to those of most dwarf novae ; they also tend to decay rapidly @xcite .",
    "for this reason , there is little spectroscopy available for outbursts of these systems . however",
    ", spectra do exist for ex hya in outburst , which , show strong emission lines with interesting velocity structure , reminiscent of the sw sex stars @xcite . in this way",
    ", ex hya resembles lanning 386 , but the morphological fit is imperfect  the brightenings we see in lanning 386 appear to be more frequent than those seen in most dq her stars .",
    "also , we have ( as of yet ) no direct evidence that lanning 386 is a magnetic system , because we are unaware of any searches for the coherent pulsations and/or circular polarization that would prove the case .",
    "it has been suggested that the outbursts seen in some magnetic systems are due to mass - transfer bursts rather than the disk instabilities that are thought to cause normal dwarf nova outbursts . during a period of increased mass transfer , material overflowing",
    "the disk could give rise to enhanced emission ",
    "there is evidence for this in ex hya @xcite .",
    "it may be that the outbursts seen in lanning 386 , whatever their trigger , involve enhanced mass transfer  which may or may not be exclusive to magnetic systems .",
    "we can summarize the morphological conundrum presented by lanning 386 as follows : its minimum - light spectrum and the light curve suggest it is a dwarf nova with frequent , relatively low - amplitude outbursts , while at maximum light it resembles a novalike variable , with some ( but not all ) the characteristics of an sw sex star .",
    "ex hya , a magnetic system , shows a similar set of symptoms , but the presentation is not identical .",
    "while this paper was in production we learned that h. lanning had died in 2007 december ; we thank him posthumously for encouraging us to get spectra of this star and dedicate this paper to his memory .",
