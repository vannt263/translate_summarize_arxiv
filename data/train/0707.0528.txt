    "there is great interest in spherically symmetric self - similar solutions to einstein s equations because of their numerous applications in astrophysics and cosmology  @xcite .",
    "indeed there is now considerable evidence for the  similarity hypothesis  , which postulates that spherically symmetric solutions may naturally evolve to self - similar form in a variety of situations .",
    "the status of this hypothesis has been recently reviewed by carr and coley  @xcite . in view of this",
    ", it is clearly important to have as complete a classification of spherically symmetric self - similar solutions as possible .",
    "spherically symmetric self - similar solutions have the feature that all dimensionless quantities can be expressed in terms of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are suitably chosen radial and time coordinates .",
    "if the source of the gravitational field is a single perfect fluid , cahill and taub  @xcite have shown that the only barotropic equation of state compatible with the similarity assumption has the form @xmath6 for some constant @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the energy density and the pressure , respectively . in this case , for a given value of @xmath7 , the solutions are described by two parameters and , providing one restricts attention to shock - free perfect fluids with positive pressure ( @xmath10 ) , they have been completely classified .",
    "this classification has been achieved using a combination of the `` comoving '' approach ( in which the coordinates are adapted to the fluid 4-velocity ) and the `` homothetic '' approach ( in which the coordinates are adapted to the homothetic vector ) .",
    "these approaches have been used by carr and coley  @xcite ( henceforth cc ) and goliath et al .",
    "@xcite , respectively , although a full understanding of the solutions requires that one combines them  @xcite .",
    "a key step in the cc analysis is the derivation of all possible asymptotic behaviors at large and small distances  @xcite . for positive pressure ,",
    "there are at least three kinds of behavior at large spatial distances ( usually corresponding to the limit @xmath11 ) : ( 1 ) asymptotically friedmann ( 1-parameter ) ; ( 2 ) asymptotically kantowski - sachs ( 1-parameter ) , though these are probably unphysical for @xmath12 ) ; and ( 3 ) asymptotically quasi - static ( 2-parameter ) .",
    "there are also two families of solutions which exist only when @xmath13 : ( 4 ) asymptotically minkowski at infinite @xmath14 ( 1-parameter ) ; and ( 5 ) asymptotically minkowski at finite @xmath14 but infinite physical distance ( 2-parameter ) . at small spatial distances , the solutions are of four kinds : they contain either ( a ) a black hole singularity or ( b ) a naked singularity at finite @xmath14 ( but zero physical distance ) or they can be connected to @xmath15 via a sonic point , in which case they are either ( c ) static or ( d ) represent a perturbation of the friedmann solution",
    ".    the complete family of @xmath10 solutions can now be found by combining the five kinds of large - distance behavior and four kinds of small - distance behavior .",
    "the way in which one connects the large - distance and small - distance solutions depends crucially on whether or not the solution passes through a sonic point .",
    "if the solutions remain supersonic ( or subsonic ) everywhere , then the small-@xmath14 behavior is uniquely determined by the large-@xmath14 behavior . however , if there is a sonic point , the behavior of the solutions is much more complicated because the equations do not determine their behavior uniquely there , so there can be a discontinuity .",
    "indeed , only a subset of solutions are `` regular '' at a sonic point in the sense that the pressure gradient is finite and they can be extended beyond it . because of this feature , the family of solutions with a regular center and a regular sonic point have a band structure , with the solutions which are analytic at the center and sonic point forming a discrete subset of these  @xcite .",
    "this feature is very important for naked singularity formation and critical behavior in the gravitational collapse of a perfect fluid  @xcite .    in this and the accompanying papers  @xcite ( henceforth paper ii )",
    ", we take a first step in extending the classification of cc to the negative pressure case ( @xmath16 ) , using a combination of numerical and analytical studies .",
    "in fact , part of the work is already done , because ref .",
    "@xcite does include the asymptotic analysis for @xmath17 . however , there are some errors in that work ( see appendix a ) and the full family of solutions has not yet been analyzed .",
    "this paper will focus particularly on the case with @xmath1 .",
    "although this equation of state violates the strong energy condition and was little emphasized by cc , it may be very relevant for cosmology  both in the early universe ( when inflation occurred  @xcite ) and at the current epoch  @xcite ( when acceleration may be driven by some form of `` dark energy '' ) . in both situations",
    "the matter model exhibits `` anti - gravity '' but the dominant , null and weak energy conditions still hold .    as in the positive pressure case",
    ", it should be stressed that our classification does not cover imperfect or multiple fluids or solutions with shocks .",
    "the accelerated expansion of the universe can also be realized by a scalar field with a flat potential ( i.e. quintessence ) .",
    "the non - existence of self - similar black hole solutions embedded in an exact friedmann universe for this case was already demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite and this is clearly complementary to the present work .",
    "there are several key differences between the @xmath1 and @xmath18 cases .",
    "a purely formal difference is that the limiting values of @xmath14 for large and small spatial distances in the flat friedmann solution are reversed : large spatial distances now correspond to @xmath19 and small ones to @xmath20 .",
    "the other differences have more physical significance .",
    "the first is that there are no sound - waves , since the sound - speed @xmath21 is imaginary .",
    "this considerably simplifies the analysis , since there can be no discontinuities and solutions are analytic everywhere .",
    "the second is that there is no exact static solution . although there are still asymptotically quasi - static solutions ( a point which was missed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the kantowski - sachs and asymptotically quasi - kantowski - sachs solutions now become physical .",
    "finally , the solutions which were asymptotically minkowski at large distances are now replaced with solutions which are asymptotically singular at small distances .    despite these differences , many features of the cc classification still apply .",
    "in particular , there is still a 1-parameter family of solutions asymptotic to the flat friedmann model at large distances and these are of great physical interest since they may have cosmological applications . in the positive - pressure case ,",
    "some of these solutions are supersonic everywhere and contain black holes which grow at the same rate as the particle horizon  @xcite .",
    "others represent density perturbations in a friedmann background which always maintain the same form relative to the particle horizon  @xcite .",
    "however , recently it was pointed out that none of these positive - pressure solutions are `` properly '' asymptotic friedmann because they exhibit a solid angle deficit at infinity  @xcite",
    ". they may still be relevant to the real universe ( since observations may not preclude such an angle deficit ) but it would be more accurate to describe them as `` quasi - friedmann '' .    in the @xmath1 case , we will show that there are genuine asymptotically friedmann solutions .",
    "we will analyze these solutions numerically and exploit these results in paper ii  @xcite to interpret the solutions physically .",
    "the key feature is the existence of asymptotically kantowski - sachs and static solutions , both of which are extendible analytically .",
    "this leads to the possibility of cosmological black hole , wormhole and white hole solutions .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the basic field equations for spherically symmetric self - similar spacetimes .",
    "we describe some exact solutions in section iii and solutions which are asymptotic to these in section iv .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss their implications in section v.",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric spacetime with the line element @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "we take the matter field to be a perfect fluid with energy - momentum tensor @xmath24 where @xmath9 and @xmath8 are the pressure and the energy density , respectively , @xmath25 is the @xmath26-velocity of the fluid , and we use units with @xmath27 .",
    "we will adopt comoving coordinates , so that the @xmath26-velocity is @xmath28 the field equations can then be written in the following form : @xmath29 where a comma denotes partial differentiation and @xmath30 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the first two equations correspond to the energy - momentum conservation and the next two specify the misner - sharp mass @xmath31 .",
    "five of the above six equations are independent . throughout this paper , we call the direction of increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath5 the future ( past ) direction .",
    "a spacetime is self - similar if it admits a homothetic killing vector @xmath32 , which is defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the lie derivative along @xmath32 .",
    "cahill and taub  @xcite first investigated spherically symmetric self - similar solutions in which the homothetic killing vector is neither parallel nor orthogonal to the fluid flow vector .",
    "they showed that  by a suitable coordinate transformation ",
    "such solutions can be put into a form in which all dimensionless quantities are functions only of the dimensionless variable @xmath35 . in this case , @xmath32 is given by @xmath36    the line element in a spherically symmetric self - similar spacetime can be written as @xmath37 a hypersurface @xmath38 of constant @xmath14 is called a similarity surface and is generated by the homothetic killing vector .",

    "a similarity surface is spacelike for @xmath43 , timelike for @xmath44 and null for @xmath45 . in the latter case , @xmath46 is also null and the similarity surface is called a similarity horizon .",
