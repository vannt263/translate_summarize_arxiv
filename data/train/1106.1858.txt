    "ob stars have the most dramatic influence on the evolution of surrounding medium , thereby regulating the star - formation activity of a complex . however , their evolution in a clustered environment and how they interact with the cold interstellar medium and process local gas to form new generation young stars is still not clear .",
    "ultracompact ( uc ) regions are manifestations of newly formed massive ( o or early b ) stars deeply embedded in the parental cloud .",
    "the uc regions further evolve into the less obscure stage of compact and classical regions . during the expansion they may sweep low density material forming dense layers of gas or interact with pre - existing dense clumps leading to density enhancement . in both the cases ,",
    "matter at a later stage becomes unstable against self gravity and may lead to new star formation ( elmegreen & lada 1977 ) .",
    "however , the expansion usually takes place in non - homogeneous medium and the surroundings of the regions are generally rich in molecular chemistry , which result in a complicated morphology .",
    "therefore , a detailed study of the star - forming region ( sfr ) at various wavebands is necessary to trace the evolutionary status of young sources and star - formation scenario of an environment . in this paper",
    ", we present results of an optically obscured young massive sfr , located between two evolved regions , namely s255 and s257 ( sharpless 1959 ) .",
    "the photometric spectral type suggests the exciting sources of s255 and s257 are b0v ( moffat et al .",
    "1979 ) and b0.5v ( reid 2008 ) type of stars .",
    "these two regions are itself a part of a larger complex consisting of five regions namely s254 , s255 , s256 , s257 and s258 . the complex is situated at a distance of @xmath0 2.5 kpc ( russeil , adami , & georgelin 2007 ) and is a part of gemini ob association ( huang & thaddeus 1986 ) . in the present study ,",
    "we have adopted the distance of 2.5 kpc for our analysis .",
    "however , we also derived distance to the region using spectroscopic observations that come out to be close to the value of 2.5 kpc ( see section 3 ) . a cluster s255-ir (",
    "also called as s255 - 2 ) containing infrared ( ir)-excess sources ( howard , pipher , & forrest 1997 ) is embedded in the optically obscured region and is also associated with compact and   regions , namely s255 - 2a , s255 - 2b , and s255 - 2c , whose exciting sources are b1 zero - age - main - sequence ( zams ) stars ( snell & bally 1986 ) , of which two are optically visible",

    "figure 1 shows the h@xmath6 continuum image , where individual regions are marked .",
    "the dark lane between s255 and s257 is the subject of the present study and is devoid of optical stellar sources .",
    "however , this region shows several signatures of recent star formation such as : ir - excess sources ( howard , pipher , & forrest 1997 ; miralles et al .",
    "1997 ) , herbig - haro objects ( miralles et al .",
    "1997 ) , compact and   regions ( snell & bally 1986 ; kurtz , churchwell , & wood 1994 ) , dense millimeter cores ( cyganowski , brogan , & hunter 2007 ) and masers ( goddi et al . 2007 ) , therefore indicating that star formation is currently active in the dark lane . since the dark lane contains a lot of gas and dust , as found by previous authors , hereafter we refer to this as `` gas ridge '' for further discussion in the paper .",

    "it is not easy to subtract such emissions , which may be misleading to the spectral classification .",
    "the absence of significant line at 4128    and presence of very weak 4481    line in the spectra indicate a spectral type earlier than b2 and the contributions of these lines increase towards spectral types later than b2 ( walborn & fitzpatrick 1990 ) . by comparing the strength of various lines",
    ", we classified the most probable spectral types of the ionizing sources of s255 , s257 and s255 - 2a as o9.5 , b0.5 and b2 respectively .",
    "the poor signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum of the ionizing source of s255 - 2b limits the accuracy of classification , but the spectrum shows the signature of an early - b type star , possibly b2-b3 .",
    "the luminosity criterion depends mainly upon the ratios of 4553   to 4387   and 4089   to 4121  , which shows a smooth progression along the main - sequence ( ms ) points to supergiant class .",
    "though the assessment of luminosity class is difficult from the present spectra , we favor the luminosity as class v for the ionizing sources of s255 and s257 due to the presence of 4686   and 4553   lines in absorption . as both s255",
    "- 2a and s255 - 2b have characteristics comparable to those of compact regions ( snell & bally 1986 ) , they are therefore not dynamically evolved objects .",
    "according to meynet et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , an 18 @xmath30 star ( corresponds to b0 spectral type ) has ms lifetime of @xmath0 8 myr .",
    "therefore , the luminosity class v seems to be more plausible for the ionizing sources of s255 - 2a and s255 - 2b .    to obtain the distance of s255 - 2a",
    ", we estimated the visual extinction ( @xmath31 ) as 5.30 mag of the ionizing source , using a standard value of r@xmath32 @xmath33 3.12 and adopting an intrinsic color @xmath34 = -0.24 ( cox 2000 ) for a b2 ms star , along with our measured photometric color @xmath35 = 1.46 . using the m@xmath32 -spectral type calibration table from russeil ( 2003 )",
    ", the distance turns out to be 2.6 kpc . for the ionizing sources of s255 and s257 regions , we adopted magnitudes and colors from moffat et al .",
    "( 1979 ) as the sources are saturated in our photometry . for s255",
    ", we find @xmath36 = 1.18 mag using @xmath35 = 0.88 and @xmath34 = -0.30 , which corresponds to @xmath31 = 3.68 mag . similarly , for s257 , we find @xmath36 = 0.87 mag using @xmath35 = 0.57 and @xmath34 = -0.30 , which corresponds to @xmath31 = 2.71 mag .",
    "following the same procedure as discussed above , the distance turns out to be 2.7 and 2.3 kpc for s255 and s257 , respectively .",
    "the above analysis suggests probable association among the sources .",
    "the resulting average distance ( 2.53 @xmath25 0.21 kpc ) for the complex agrees well with the average distance 2.46 @xmath25 0.17 kpc obtained by russeil , adami , & georgelin ( 2007 ) .",
    "there is however some ambiguity concerning the distance to the region .",
    "a number of authors suggested that the whole region corresponds to a cloud complex at 2.3 - 2.6 kpc ( chavarra et al . 2008 and references therein ) , which is also supported by our distance estimation .",
    "therefore , in the present work we have adopted a distance of 2.5 kpc for further analysis .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning a recent study by rygl et al .",
    "( 2010 ) of the s255-ir region , which reported a distance of @xmath0 1.6 kpc .",
    "the s255-ir region is a cluster forming environment which contains a number of ob - stars ( howard , pipher , & forrest , 1997 ) , of which only two are visible in the optical band .",
    "previous observations at 5 ghz show that this sfr usually contains four centimeter continuum sources ( snell & bally 1986 ) . since the emissions from  and hyper - compact regions are optically thick at this frequency , we analysed the radio continuum emission at 14.94 ghz obtained with vla .",
    "figure 4 shows contours of the 14.94 ghz radio free - free emission overlaid onto the image .",
    "the map mainly shows five compact radio emissions and four of them are marked in the figure as per nomenclature by snell & bally ( 1986 ) .",
    "however , we detected one extra source that has not been previously identified in the literature . though the 5 ghz map by snell & bally ( 1986 ) shows some weak radio emission approximately at the position of the source , the flux value of the source is not mentioned in their paper",
    "hence , to conclude whether the source is an extragalactic radio object or the true  region , one needs spectral index measurement which requires emission at two frequencies . due to unavailability of the flux measurement at other frequencies , in the present analysis",
    ", we tentatively do not consider this radio source as a possible  region .",
    "however , the spectral indices between 5 ghz and the 14.94 ghz of the other radio sources suggest thermal origin .",
    "the regions of recent star formation in the image are traced by the bright nebulosity , whereas the regions detected in centimeter surveys trace the high mass star - forming environment .",
    "it is well established that formation of high mass stars in young complexes is accompanied by a cluster of less massive sources .",
    "hence , the nir point sources in figure 4 are likely candidates of intermediate to low mass stars . out of the five compact radio emissions ,",
    "the most intense emission associated with components s255n and s255 - 2c seems to be elongated along the east - west direction .    to derive the physical properties of the thermal radio sources , we measured peak position , integrated flux density and angular diameter deconvolved from the beam by fitting a two - dimensional elliptical gaussian using the task jmfit in aips .",
    "we calculated the physical parameters assuming the simplest geometry of uniform spherical model .",
    "the physical parameters are : @xmath37 , the rms electron density ; @xmath38 , the emission measure ; @xmath39@xmath40 , the optical depth ; @xmath41 , the number of lyman continuum photons for a spherically symmetric region and the zams spectral type of the ionizing source .",
    "the zams spectral type has been estimated from the @xmath41 and the calibration table of panagia ( 1973 ) , for an electron temperature of 10@xmath42 k. these parameters were derived from the measured angular diameter and integrated flux density and using the formulae given by panagia & walmsley ( 1978 ) and mezger & henderson ( 1967 ) for spherical , homogeneous nebulae .",
    "the derived physical parameters are listed in table 3 .",
    "since we derived the average properties , the rms electron density of the regions is expected to be lower than the density at the peak positions .",
    "the spectral types suggest that all the sources are ionized by massive early b - type zams stars and their physical parameters point to the evolutionary class between compact and  regions ( kurtz et al .",
    "2000 ) . since the compact and  regions are not dynamically evolved objects",
    ", this indicates that the massive star formation has started recently at various locations of the gas ridge , whereas , the larger sizes and lower electron density values estimated from the 1.4 ghz observation by snell & bally ( 1986 ) for the regions s255 ( size @xmath0 1.16 pc , n@xmath43 @xmath0 100 @xmath44 ) and s257 ( size @xmath0 0.87 pc , n@xmath43 @xmath0 111 @xmath44 ) , indicate that both are in an advanced stage of evolution .",
    "this confirms that the ionizing sources of s255 and s257 are in a more evolved stage than the massive stars in the gas ridge .",
    "figure 5 represents a false @xmath17 color - composite image ( @xmath9 , blue ; @xmath12 , green ; and @xmath45 , red ) of our observed region centered on the cluster s255-ir . in figure 5 ,",
    "a clustering of stellar sources is apparent at the center of the image .",
    "the figure also displays several red sources , indicating the presence of likely young stellar population still deeply embedded in the molecular cloud , whereas , bluest stars mainly seen towards the eastern and western parts of the image , are likely evolved / foreground objects of the field .",
    "a prominent @xmath45-band nebulosity is seen at the center of the cluster , with a dark lane surrounding it .",
    "the positions of the ionizing sources are marked with circles in the enlarged version of the color - composite image shown in the right panel of figure 5 , which reveals that most of the red sources in the vicinity of s255-ir lie towards the western side , possibly indicating that more young stars are concentrated in this direction .",
    "apart from the main clustering at the center , patchy nebulosity and diffuse wisp emissions are also seen in the image and many red sources appear to be projected on these emissions .",
    "the single dish observations have established the presence of a large column of gas , elongated along the lane between s255 and s257 ( klein et al .",
    "2005 ) . hence , these red sources are possibly young protostars that are associated with the gas reservoir .",
    "we now discuss the nature of the associated low mass stellar population using our nir observations . to examine the nature of the stellar population in the gas ridge , we used nir cm ( @xmath46/@xmath47 ) and cc ( @xmath46/@xmath48 ) diagrams of the sources detected in @xmath49 and @xmath17 bands , respectively , by comparing with the cm and cc diagrams of a nearby control field . since the extinction is more sensitive to the shorter wavelength ranges and",
    "also young protostars are more prominent at longer wavelengths , we use the sources detected only in @xmath12 and @xmath45 bands to construct @xmath50 cm diagrams .",
    "figure 6 shows the cm diagrams for the s255-ir sfr and for the nearby control field , where the nearly vertical solid lines represent zams at a distance of 2.5 kpc , reddened by @xmath31 = 0 , 2.5 , 20 , 40 and 60 mag , respectively .",
    "the parallel slanting lines represent the reddening vectors to the corresponding spectral type",
    ". we would like to mention that the uncertainty in spectral type determination is mainly due to the error in the distance determination as well as the excess of the individual sources .",
    "a comparison with the control field reveals that the majority of the cluster population shows an apparent separation from the foreground field stars distributed at ( @xmath46 ) @xmath0 0.2 mag .",
    "figure 6 manifests that the majority of the sources in the s255-ir region are likely to be reddened ms members and/or pre - main - sequence ( pms ) sources with strong infrared excess emission .",
    "most of the sources with @xmath46 @xmath51 2 , not detected in the @xmath9-band , are likely candidates for young sources with disks and envelopes .",
    "massive stars ( @xmath26 8 @xmath30 ) do not have pms phase and appear on the zams while still embedded in the molecular cloud , whereas , lower mass stars spend a significant amount of time in the pms phase . therefore , in figure @xmath52 , all the sources may not be reddened zams stars",
    ". there are 22 sources in figure 6 which appear to be massive with spectral type earlier than b3 .",
    "probably , these sources appear luminous due to excess emissions in the because one would expect radio free - free emissions in the vicinity of such sources .",
    "however , we detected only four compact radio emissions at 14.94 ghz in the vicinity of sfrs s255-ir and s255-n .",
    "the map is sensitive down to 0.11 mjy / beam at 14.94 ghz , which corresponds to @xmath0 2.9 @xmath1 10@xmath53 number of lyman continuum photons per second for an optically thin thermal source situated at a distance of 2.5 kpc , for an electron temperature of 10@xmath5 @xmath47 .",
    "this corresponds to a zams spectral type close to b2 ( panagia 1973 ) and therefore sets an upper limit of @xmath0 10 @xmath30 , for the sources that do not show compact radio emissions .",
    "the sources associated with the radio emissions are marked in the @xmath50 cm diagram ( figure 6 ) , following the same nomenclature by howard et al .",
    "source irs3 corresponds to the radio peak s255 - 2a , the strongest radio continuum source and the bluest of all the stars of the s255-ir cluster .",
    "the cm diagram indicates the star as b2 type .",
    "the source irs2 corresponds to the radio peak s255 - 2b and is situated @xmath0 2@xmath13 southwest of s255 - 2a .",
    "the cm diagram suggests the source as b2-b3 type .",
    "the infrared spectral type estimation for both the sources is consistent with the radio estimation at 14.94 ghz within a subclass .",

    "the mass of the ysos shows a range from 0.6 to 7.6 @xmath30 , implying we are sampling ysos only upto 0.6 @xmath30 . for ionizing source of the  region s255 - 2c ,",
    "the acceptable sed fitting models suggest a massive star ( @xmath0 27 @xmath30 ) , with an age of @xmath0 0.1 myr .",
    "the models also predict that the source is deeply embedded behind @xmath0 42 mag of visual extinction and has an envelope accretion rate of 10@xmath95 yr@xmath28 . similarly ,",
    "following the procedure given by chavarra et al ( 2008 ) , the dynamical age is estimated to be less than 10@xmath81 yr for the compact and  regions , for an assumed density of 10@xmath81 cm @xmath96 .",
    "these estimations indicate that the massive stars associated with the gas ridge are younger in nature .",
    "it is also apparent from tables 4 and 5 that the disk accretion rate of the ysos outside the gas ridge is in the range of 10@xmath97 @xmath98 10@xmath99 @xmath30 yr@xmath28 , less than that of ysos in the gas ridge , which is in the range of 10@xmath100 @xmath98 10@xmath97 @xmath30 yr@xmath28 .",
    "similarly , the envelope infall rates for most of the ysos inside the gas ridge are relatively higher than the ysos outside the gas ridge .",
    "these derived characteristics of the ysos in the gas ridge are possibly the consequence of their younger age than the ysos distributed outside . however , in the absence of mir to millimeter data the above values should be treated with caution .",
    "the derived characteristics of the ysos along with the morphology of the complex and physical properties of the associated gas and dust can be used to discuss the evolutionary status of the star - forming sites and the overall star - formation activity of the complex .",
    "an embedded cluster along with three prominent clumps mm1 , mm2 and mm3 ( minier et al . 2005 ) appear to be sandwiched between the two evolved regions s255 and s257 .",
    "the clumps mm1 & mm2 contain a similar amount of dense gas of mass @xmath64 200 @xmath30 , and show a higher gas temperature of 40 k and are in agreement with that of zinchenko et al .",
    "this is in contrast to mm3 , which has a mass of @xmath0 100 @xmath30 and the gas temperature is expected to be around 20 k. these observations led us to suggest that the temperature of mm1 and mm2 is significantly higher than the starless clumps , representing that the clumps are possibly internally heated by the protostars , whereas the clump mm3 represents the earlier stage of star formation as compared to mm1 and mm2 .",
    "it is to be noted that the clump mm2 lies close to the infrared cluster s255-ir , where the cluster harbors two optically visible massive stars , along with several intermediate to low mass stars of different properties detected in the  bands , whereas , the sources in the vicinity of the clump mm2 are detected in the only , and possibly represent a more embedded phase of star formation .",
    "the clump mm2 is also associated with ch@xmath101oh , h@xmath102o and oh masers ( minier et al .",
    "2005 ; goddi et al . 2007 ) .",
    "ch@xmath101oh maser traces earliest stages of massive star formation ( walsh et al .",
    "1998 ) and turns off shortly after the formation of  region .",
    "the detection of maser emission towards the centre of mm1 , which has a characteristic lifetime of 2.5 @xmath1 10@xmath42 to 4.5 @xmath1",
    "10@xmath42 yr ( van der walt 2005 ) , indicates this is not a dynamically evolved object .",
    "it seems that the sources associated with the clump mm2 are most probably younger than the sources associated with s255-ir .",
    "the sources associated with the regions s255 - 2a and s255 - 2b of the cluster s255-ir are not associated with millimetre continuum emission and hence , presumably are in the later stage of evolution .",
    "there was also evidence of bipolar outflows from the sources associated with the s255 - 2c ( wang et al .",
    "2011 ; zinchenko et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , along with presence of dusty disk ( tamura et al .",
    "1991 ) , which supports the interpretation that the b - type stars may form via an accretion outflow process similar to that of low mass stars .",
    "both these phenomena indicate an early evolutionary stage of the source ( irs1b ) associated with s255 - 2c , which is supported by the dynamical age and the age derived from the sed fitting models ( i.e age @xmath15 0.1 myr ) .",
    "an interesting question is whether the sources in the vicinity of mm2 and the massive stars of s255-ir have formed in the same region of space .",
    "although presently we do not have the necessary data to address this issue and reach a firm conclusion , it is quite possible that both populations are spatially unrelated .",
    "we also do not discard the possibility that they may represent different evolutionary stages of the same cluster forming environment .",
    "for example , in the case of the high mass star - forming region , iras 20293 + 3952 , palau et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that the region consists of starless cores , millimeter sources ,  region and more evolved nir sources .",
    "they concluded that these sources are not forming simultaneously in this cluster environment .",
    "rather , there may be different generations of star formation and this could be a possible case for s255-ir .",
    "in several cases , as for example w3 ( feigelson & townsley 2008 ; ojha et al .",
    "2009 ) and iras 19343 + 2026 ( ojha et al . 2010 ) , the massive embedded sources are found to be associated with a cluster of more evolved lower mass class ii and class iii sources , detectable in the nir bands .",
    "this suggests that , in these regions the intermediate to massive protostars have formed after the first generation of low - mass stars . the clump mm1 is associated with an  region identified in the 14.94 ghz map and is possibly ionized by a b1 type star .",
    "kurtz , hofner , & lvarey ( 2004 ) detected a class i ch@xmath101oh maser at 44 ghz and an h@xmath102o maser at 22 ghz in the close vicinity of the  region .",
    "the non - detection of ionizing source(s ) of the associated  region in the near to mid infrared band and the presence of h@xmath102 knots tracing an outflow ( miralles et al .",
    "1997 ) , indicate a very young age .",
    "since the initial phase of massive star formation is intimately linked to cluster formation and the fragmentation of the molecular clouds , this indicate that s255n is a site of cluster formation in its early stage .",
    "indeed , cyganowski , brogan , & hunter ( 2007 ) found evidence of a massive protocluster with the help of high resolution ( @xmath0 4@xmath13.7 @xmath1 2@xmath13.7 ) interferometric observations at 1.3 mm continuum emission and detected three compact cores with no infra - red counterparts .",
    "the masses of the cores range from 6 - 35 @xmath30 .",
    "the identification of centimeter emission and multiple millimeter continuum sources towards the s255n region indicates an ongoing ( proto)cluster formation .",
    "the features discussed above support the youthfulness of mm2 and mm1 regions and indicate the upper limit for star formation activity around mm2 and mm1 should not be more than @xmath0 10@xmath103 yr .",
    "the clump mm3 shows no ionized gas emission in the proximity of the dust peak of mass @xmath0 100 @xmath30 . for a typical star formation efficiency of 0.3 ( c.f lada & lada 2003 )",
    ", the clump would likely form a star greater than 8 @xmath30 .",
    "if this happens then it is a site for the earliest stages of star formation in which the massive star has not yet reached the zams .",
    "this indicates that it is likely to be less than @xmath0 10@xmath81 years old because a single early b - star ( m @xmath0 10 @xmath30 ) reaches the zams in about 10@xmath81 years .",
    "it is worth mentioning that wang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) detected low velocity outflows in mm3 ( s255s ) as compared to mm2 and mm1 and suggested that mm3 is likely in the collpase phase .",
    "the lower temperature of the clump mm3 and non - detection of stellar sources in the possibly indicates that mm3 is in the earliest evolutionary stage .",
    "the above discussion reveals that the star formation is non - coeval along the gas ridge , where the stars of ages from 0.1 - 2 myr are spatially distributed along the different locations of the cloud .",
    "the exciting stars of s255 and s257 are isolated sources , without any co  spatial clustering of low - mass stars around them ( zinnecker et al .",
    ". however , chavarra et al . (",
    "2008 ) hypothesize that a cluster ( g192.63 - 0.00 ) is associated with s255 .",
    "future spectroscopic observations would confirm the association of g192.63 - 0.00 with s255 .",
    "figure 14 shows the surroundings of the evolved regions s255 and s257 , where the white background image represents the irac 8.0 @xmath11 m emissions which generally trace pahs coming from the photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) at the surface of the molecular cloud .",
    "generally , these emissions are due to the absorption of far - uv radiation at the surface of the molecular cloud , which escape from the region and the pahs within pdrs are excited and remit their energy at mir wavelength .",
    "the green radio contours show the ionized gas from radio continuum observations at 610 mhz ( zinchenko et al . , in preparation ) . in radio ,",
    "both s255 and s257 appear almost circular in size .",
    "the figure also displays that 8 @xmath11 m emissions are prominent at the peripheries of s255 and s257 , in the direction of the dark lane and are weaker towards the interiors of s255 and s257 from the lane , particularly for s257 .",
    "these emission features correspond to the dark patches seen in the optical band and also roughly coincide with co emissions found in these directions by chavarra et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . the @xmath104co map by chavarra et al .",
    "( 2008 ) reveals that the distribution of the gas is rather non - uniform and clumpy , with its surface density reaching maximum along the gas ridge , where new embedded star formation is expected to occur .",
    "s255-s257 is a part of gemini ob1 association .",
    "the star formation in ob association is often quite complex .",
    "one common property of ob associations is that they are sub - structured and often consist of sub - groups of different ages .",
    "carpenter et al .",
    "( 1995a , b ) detected several lower luminosity sources and presumably low mass cores scattered through the gemini ob1 complex , whereas most of the massive dense cores are found adjacent to the optical regions and often show arc - shaped structure .",
    "they interpreted that the induced star formation in the massive dense cores is prominent in the complex due to sweeping and compression of the molecular material .",
    "the complex s255-s257 shows a clear congregation of highly obscured ysos , herbig - haro objects , astronomical masers , compact and  regions .",
    "all these sources are concentrated preferentially along the vertical dense bar of gas and dust at the interface of the two regions seen by the ionized gas distribution at 610 mhz .",
    "the ionized gas emissions are delineated with pdr , and therefore indicate a definite evidence of physical interaction of the regions with the surrounding molecular material and is responsible for the shaping of the ring like pdr structure .",
    "the ionizing sources of the two adjacent evolved regions are ms o9-b0 stars .",
    "if they have evolved in the same ambient density , then they might have similar ages .",
    "the ms life time of o9 star is of the order of @xmath0 6.5 myr .",
    "it is difficult to constrain the precise age of the ms star with sufficient accuracy , to compare its relative age with that of the age of ysos detected in the gas ridge .",
    "however , the dynamical age of both the evolved regions is in the range of @xmath0 0.8 - 1.6 myr ( chavarra et al . 2008",
    "; bieging et al .",
    "2009 ) , whereas , the low mass sources scattered in the complex show a mean age of @xmath0 2.5 myr .",
    "low mass stars do not dramatically alter the environment in their vicinity , whereas the stellar radiations and winds from massive star(s ) play a crucial role in the evolution of the nearby cloud and thus can induce next generation star formation ( elmegreen & lada 1977 ) . the minimum criteria to ascertain such processes is that the second generation star(s ) should have younger age in comparison to nearby massive star(s ) .",
    "the physical properties of the compact and   regions in the gas ridge suggest that they are younger than adjacent regions s255 and s257 ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the age of the sources inside the dense ridge is of the order of @xmath0 1.2 myr or less and considering 1.6 myr as a typical value for the age of evolved regions , it appears that the sources in the gas ridge are younger than the adjacent massive stars as well as lower mass stars of the complex .",
    "these signatures indicate that the sources found in the gas bar might have formed due to the interaction of the evolved regions .",
    "a number of mechanisms by which massive stars can affect the subsequent star formation in the region have been proposed .",
    "one such process is compression of pre - existing molecular clumps due to impinging of ionization / shock front , leading to density enhancement , which when it exceeds the local critical mass , collapse to form new stars ( bertoldi 1989 ; lefloch & lazareff 1994 ) .",
    "the observational signature of such a process would be the limb - brighten rim , having a dense head and a tail , extending away from the ionizing sources ( e.g. , miao et al .",
    "the morphology of the radio emissions and/or the h@xmath6 emission around the sources s255 - 2a and s255 - 2b show symmetrical distribution , not like the cometary morphology with a bright rim as found in case of bright - rimmed clouds ( e.g. urquhart et al .",
    "2006 ; ogura & sugitani 1998 ) .",
    "the mm contours also do not show any asymmetric distribution of molecular matter , as expected in case of the cometary morphology ( e.g. morgan et al .",
    "the overall distribution of molecular material and the distribution of radio continuum do not give strong evidence in favour of star formation due to compression of pre - existing molecular clumps .",
    "however , the compression of pre - existing filamentary cloud can not be ignored .",
    "another proposed mechanism that can induce star formation around the region is a  collect & collapse \" process . in this mechanism ,",
    "the neutral matter piles up between the ionization and the shock fronts of the expanding region .",
    "this compressed material may be dynamically unstable and fragments into dense clumps which can then form new stars ( deharveng et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we observed recent star formation activity at the interface of the s255 and s257 .",
    "if the regions are evolved in the same ambient medium , and s255 is being excited by a relatively early type source , then we expect to have a larger impact on the star formation process at the interface . therefore , we compare the observed properties with that of the analytical model of star formation at the periphery of the expanding region through `` collect and collapse '' process by whitworth et al .",
    "the model predicts the time when the fragmentation starts ( @xmath105 ) and the radius at the time of fragmentation ( @xmath106 ) , which weakly depend upon isothermal sound speed in the compressed layer ( @xmath107 ) , and varies from 0.2 - 0.6  km s@xmath28 , the number of lyman continuum photons ( @xmath108 ) emitted by the massive star and the density of the ambient medium ( @xmath109 ) in which the expansion of region occurs and are given by : @xmath110 where @xmath111=[@xmath107/0.2  km s@xmath28 ] , @xmath113=[@xmath108/10@xmath114 s@xmath28 ] and @xmath115=[@xmath109/10@xmath116 @xmath117 are dimensionless variables . adopting 0.2 for @xmath107 , 2.4 @xmath1 10@xmath118 photons s@xmath28 for @xmath108 for the ionizing star ( o9.5v ) of s255 ( vacca et al .",
    "1996 ) and 3 @xmath1 10@xmath116 for @xmath109 ( chavarra et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) , we obtained @xmath105  1.1 myr and @xmath106  2.8 pc .",
    "this indicates that the fragmentation will start at a radius of 2.8 pc , whereas the young cluster and associated stellar sources are situated at a radius of @xmath0 1.7 pc from the ionizing star of s255 .",
    "if one considers the present age of the ysos ( @xmath0 1.2 myr ) plus the fragmentation time ( @xmath0 1.1 myr ) , one would expect an age difference of @xmath64 2 myr between the ionizing source of s255 ( age @xmath0 1.6 myr ) and the ysos ( age @xmath0 1.2 myr ) in the core . at the same time , to reach from the fragmentation time of the shell to the present age of the ysos ( @xmath0 1.2 myr ) , one would expect a shell radius much beyond 2.8 pc . though the above estimations are based on the assumptions on the sound speed in the compressed layer .",
    "increasing the value of sound speed increases the fragmentation radius and time further .",
    "it appears that the region is not old enough to produce the s255-ir cluster by `` collect and collapse '' process .",
    "morphologically also , it seems that `` collect and collapse '' process is not viable here , as the cluster s255-ir is not associated with the ring of pah emissions that surround the regions s255 or s257 , which generally represent the compressed neutral matter piled up between the ionization and shock fronts .",
    "rather , the cluster is situated at the tip of the ring of pah emissions . for example , in the case of a sample of regions by deharveng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , where the star formation at their peripheries is expected due to `` collect and collapse '' process , one can see young sources / condensations , which are associated with the ring of pah emissions that delineate the regions .",
    "also in an ideal case , one would expect regularly spaced clumps along the periphery of regions and/or young protostars of roughly similar ages , distributed preferentially along the swept - up material , which is not the case here , whereas we are seeing sources at different evolutionary stages across the gas ridge and dense clumps .",
    "the radio emission from s255 and s257 at 610 mhz is rather spherical and does not show morphology similar to the champagne flow or blister type regions , where one would expect the evolution of the region in a non - uniform medium . as a result , clump formation due to `` collect and collapse '' process may not be uniformly distributed .",
    "this discussion indicates that the `` collect and collapse '' process is also not at work here .",
    "in the gas ridge which scenario should work better is difficult to conclude , but the existence of molecular clumps is not unique to the `` collect & collapse '' model .",
    "moreover , in this process the clumps should be distributed in a ring like structure in the immediate regions , not like the vertical bar structure which we are witnessing here .",
    "the morphological similarity of the matter sandwiched between s255-s257 resembles on a large scale the process of star formation that has been observed in the dense bar like structure in the large magellanic cloud at the interfaces of two expanding supergiant shells lmc4 and lmc5 ( cohen et al . 2003 ) , where it is believed that the collisions between the dense swept up neutral materials lead to star formation ( yamaguchi et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .",
    "this similar kind of star formation activity might have happened here .",
    "the above discussion reveals that it is difficult to constrain a particular scenario that is at work with the present analysis , though we favour the last scenario .",
    "however , to strengthen the notion that the rdi and `` collect & collapse '' scenarios are not at work , it would be very useful to get radial velocity information and the age of the stellar members using spectroscopic observations to confirm their association and relative evolutionary status , in order to obtain a better picture of triggered star formation .",
    "deep @xmath17 observations have been carried out in a region of 4@xmath4.9 @xmath1 4@xmath4.9 centered on the s255-ir cluster associated with the gas ridge between two evolved regions s255 and s257 . using the nir cc and cm diagrams as main diagnostics of the pms nature of the objects",

    "<S> we present results on the star - formation activity of an optically obscured region containing an embedded cluster ( s255-ir ) and molecular gas between two evolved regions s255 and s257 . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the complex using optical , near - infrared ( nir ) imaging , optical spectroscopy and radio continnum mapping at 15 ghz , along with _ spitzer_-irac results . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the main exciting sources of the evolved regions s255 and s257 and the compact regions associated with s255-ir are of o9.5 - b3 v nature , consistent with previous observations . </S>",
    "<S> our nir observations reveal 109 likely young stellar object ( yso ) candidates in an area of @xmath0 4.9 @xmath1 4.9 centered on s255-ir , which include 69 new yso candidates . </S>",
    "<S> to see the global star formation , we constructed the @xmath2 diagram for 51 optically identified irac ysos in an area of @xmath0 13@xmath3 @xmath1 13@xmath3 centered on s255-ir . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that these ysos have an approximate age between 0.1 - 4 myr , indicating a non - coeval star formation . using spectral energy distribution ( sed ) models , we constrained physical properties and evolutionary status of 31 and 16 yso candidates outside and inside the gas ridge , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the models suggest that the sources associated within the gas ridge are of younger population ( mean age @xmath0 1.2 myr ) than the sources outside the gas ridge ( mean age @xmath0 2.5 myr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of the young sources inside the gas ridge at the interface of the regions s255 and s257 , favor a site of induced star formation . </S>"
