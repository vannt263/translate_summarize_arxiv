    "one of the most attractive features of cold atomic gases is that the interatomic scattering length is under very good experimental control . using the presence of feshbach resonances",
    ", the scattering length can be tuned from highly repulsive to strongly attractive by changing the applied magnetic field .",
    "sympathetic cooling techniques allow to cool mixtures of fermionic and bosonic atoms down to extremely low temperatures where the quantum mechanical nature of both bosons and fermions becomes apparent , resulting in a bose - einstein condensate coexisting with a filled fermi sea @xcite .",
    "when the interspecies interactions are strongly attractive , changing the number of bosons alters the mean - field interaction strength and can result in a collapse of the fermi gas as observed by modugno _",
    "this instability can also be triggered by changing the scattering length itself , making use of a feshbach resonance .",
    "the divergence of the scattering length at a feshbach resonance is due to a magnetically tunable molecular state whose binding energy vanishes at resonance .",
    "this means that close to this magnetic field value , the molecular state can be populated .",
    "a number of experimental @xcite and theoretical works @xcite have been devoted to study the conversion of atoms between the atomic and molecular condensates and the thermal cloud .    in this work",
    "we study the evolution of an initially noninteracting boson - fermion mixture at zero temperature when a sudden change ( on a time scale much faster than any other time scale in the system ) in the magnetic field brings it close to an interspecies feshbach resonance .",
    "the ( fermionic ) molecules first form out of a condensate boson and a fermionic atom with an energy smaller than or equal to the fermi energy .",
    "we will refer to such fermionic atoms ( molecules ) as ` _ slow _ ' fermions *  * ( molecules ) ; and to fermions or molecules with more energy than the fermi energy as ` _ fast _ ' fermions or molecules , respectively .",
    "the decay of a molecule can then either lead back to a condensate boson with the same ` slow ' fermion or  to a thermal boson accompanied by a ` fast ' fermion .",
    "energy conservation is not violated because the interaction energy is changed .",
    "the latter process shows that the stepwise change of the magnetic field can lead to heating of the system , while the former demonstrates that coherent oscillations between fermionic atoms and molecules are possible , when a fermionic atom interacts with the condensate as a whole . due to multiple scattering of fermionic atoms , bosons and molecules , the time evolution of the ` fast ' part of the system",
    "is expected to be rather chaotic .",
    "this is why we preferred to focus on the ` slow ' fermionic atoms and molecules .",
    "the energies involved in the formation of molecules are easily two orders of magnitude bigger than the fermi energy and thus we conclude from the difference in phase space volume that it is rather unlikely that the ` fast ' decay products of a molecule will come back in the fermi sphere .",
    "this assumption allows us to study the ` slow ' fermionic atoms and molecules as a subsystem .",
    "our study is based on the model hamiltonian introduced in sec .",
    "we make some approximations that allow us to write the time dependence of ` slow ' fermionic atoms and molecules in analytical form .",
    "the results obtained with this simplified model are discussed in sec .",
    "iii , together with the experimental conditions needed to make the predictions observable , using data from @xmath0k-@xmath1rb scattering .",
    "experimentally , the scattering length as a function of the magnetic field close to a feshbach resonance can be well parameterized by    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the background scattering length , @xmath4 the position and @xmath5 the width of the resonance .",
    "a good description of the scattering physics near a feshbach resonance can be obtained by explicitly introducing molecules @xcite .",
    "these molecular states are the bound states of an interatomic potential in a closed channel and their energy relative to the threshold is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the difference in magnetic moment between the molecular and atomic states . denoting the coupling strength between atoms and molecules by @xmath8 , the hamiltonian for a trapped gas",
    "can be written as @xmath9 ,   \\label{hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the hamiltonians of the non - interacting gases of fermionic atoms , bosons and molecules , respectively .",
    "the corresponding masses of these atoms and molecules , and the trapping potentials confining them are indexed by @xmath12  and @xmath13  to indicate fermionic atoms , bosons and molecules , respectively . in the last term",
    "we stress that the parameter @xmath14 appearing in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is the bare molecular binding energy @xcite .",
    "the true binding energy @xmath15 given in ( [ nu ] ) differs from this quantity due to virtual dissociations of the molecules .",
    "background scattering is omitted , because we assume that the system is brought close enough to resonance so that the resonant contribution is much more important .",
    "starting from hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , we wish to study the dynamics of the mixture when the scattering length is suddenly brought close to a feshbach resonance . in order to grasp the basic physics ,",
    "some approximations are made .",
    "first of all we assume that there are much more condensate atoms than fermions , so that the effect on the condensate can be neglected .",
    "also the depletion of the condensate is presumed to be small , which allows for the bogoliubov approximation .",
    "finally we assume that the distance that a particle travels during a molecule formation process is small compared to the harmonic oscillator length .",
    "the latter permits us to restrict ourselves to homogeneous systems at first and use a local density approximation to take the inhomogeneity due to the confinement potential into account at a later stage .",
    "all these assumptions will be justified in sec .",
    "we thus consider a homogeneous boson - fermion mixture without interactions before @xmath16 , the moment when the magnetic field is suddenly brought close to resonance and the interactions between the atoms start taking place . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the initial state consists of condensate bosons , ` slow ' fermionic atoms ( filling the fermi sphere ) , and no molecules . from @xmath16 onwards , the evolution of this mixture is described by ( [ hamiltonian])@xmath18 the evolution will consist in the formation of molecules and their subsequent decay .",
    "pauli blocking will limit the decay channels .",
    "however , the molecular binding energy @xmath19 is , even for magnetic fields that are only @xmath20 away from resonance , much larger than the fermi energy ( since @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively the bohr magneton and the boltzmann constant , whereas @xmath24  is of the order of a few hundred nk ) and blocking effects will be small . as a consequence , a single particle description of the fermions should be a good first approximation .",
    "the simplified hamiltonian for this fermion - boson mixture reads @xmath25",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & + g_{m}\\sqrt{n_{b}}\\int \\frac{d^{3}{\\bf k}}{\\left ( 2\\pi \\right ) ^{3}}\\psi _ { m}^{\\dag } \\left ( { \\bf k}\\right ) \\psi _ { f}\\left ( { \\bf k}\\right ) + g_{m}\\int   \\frac{d^{3}{\\bf k}_{f}}{\\left ( 2\\pi \\right ) ^{3}}\\frac{d^{3}{\\bf k}_{b}}{% \\left ( 2\\pi \\right ) ^{3}}\\psi _ { m}^{\\dag } \\left ( { \\bf k}_{f}+{\\bf k}% _ { b}\\right ) \\psi _ { f}\\left ( { \\bf k}_{f}\\right ) \\psi _ { b}\\left ( { \\bf k}% _ { b}\\right ) + h.c .   \\label{hsimp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath26 has the dimension of energy and we will use @xmath27 as our dimensionless quantities ,  with @xmath28  the reduced mass of a fermion - boson pair . the first line in ( [ hsimp ] )",
    "represents the free gases of fermionic atoms , bosons and molecules , respectively .",
    "the second line in ( [ hsimp ] ) describes the interaction converting a fermionic atom and a boson into a molecule ( ` slow ' or ` fast ' ) and vice versa . in the single particle picture",
    ", we should study the time evolution of each fermion in the fermi sea individually .",
    "however , because the fermi level is much smaller than the molecular binding energy , the initial kinetic energy of the ` slow ' fermion does not influence the final result for the dynamics and can be neglected .",
    "consequently all the ` slow ' fermions will have a similar time - evolution due to the interaction with the condensate , irrespective of the specific value of their momentum .",
    "thus , it will suffice to analyze the properties of a fermion with initial momentum @xmath29 to know the evolution of all of them .    an appropriate wave function",
    "to describe one fermion that is initially at rest is @xmath30\\times \\left| n_{b}\\right\\rangle ,   \\label{psi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the amplitude of the bare fermionic atom and the bare molecule .",
    "the third term , containing the amplitude @xmath33 arises from molecules that dissociate in a fast fermionic atom and a thermal boson , which is an important process .",
    "higher order processes where the fast fermionic atom forms again a molecule that dissociates are neglected in this approach .",
    "diagrammatically speaking , this comes down to retaining only the diagrams of fig . 1  ( a ) and neglecting the contributions like those in fig . 1  ( b ) .",
    "the schrdinger equation @xmath34  allows to find the time evolution of the amplitudes in wave function ( [ psi ] ) : @xmath35 we choose as initial conditions @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this corresponds to the initial state wave function describing one ` slow ' fermionic atom @xmath38 note that @xmath39  is assumed time - independent .",
    "the linear differential equations ( [ dvgl1])-([dvgl3 ] ) can be solved with a laplace transform , yielding @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a root of @xmath43 and @xmath44  is a dimensionless parameter related to the real molecular binding energy @xmath19by @xmath45 . in evaluating the integral in ( [ dvgl2 ] ) ,",
    "we have used the relation between the real and bare molecular binding energy , @xmath19 and @xmath14 , for a momentum cutoff @xmath46 @xcite : @xmath47",
    "it is instructive for the understanding of the time evolution to investigate the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hsimp ] ) describing the system in which the time evolution takes place .",
    "the ground state for a single fermionic atom in a system described by ( [ hsimp ] ) can be investigated by using@xmath48([psi ] ) as a variational wave function with @xmath49  as variational parameters .",
    "the variational expression for the ground state energy is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is now measured in units @xmath52 minimizing this expression , with the constraint @xmath53 we find for the ground state energy the equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 which has as lowest solution ( relative to the bottom of the fermion band ) @xmath56 .",
    "the ground state is a bound state representing a coherent superposition of the states corresponding to the fermion as an atom and as a part in a molecule : @xmath57 \\left| 0\\right\\rangle ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath58 a normalization constant .",
    "similar bound states are found in the photodissociation of a negative ion @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ evareq ] ) has only one solution for @xmath59 negative .",
    "the solutions of ( [ evareq ] ) with @xmath60 form a continuum , because we consider the limit of an infinite system .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath61 corresponding to these solutions are the excited states of the hamiltonian ( [ hsimp ] ) .",
    "the time evolution of the initial state @xmath62can then be written in the basis of the eigenstates of ( [ hsimp ] ) as @xmath63 in fig .",
    "2 , the modulus square of @xmath64 ,  is shown for several values of @xmath44 in the left panel . in the right panel , the modulus square of the projection of the bound state on the molecular state , @xmath65 ,  is shown . note",
    "that expression ( [ psivant ] ) has the same structure as expressions ( [ ft]),([mt ] ) .",
    "this is to be expected , because the amplitudes @xmath66  and @xmath67 represent the projection of @xmath68  on the ` slow ' fermionic atom component and the ` slow ' molecule component : @xmath69 the two terms appearing in @xmath70 expression ( [ psivant ] )  give rise to the corresponding two terms in @xmath66 , expression ( [ ft ] ) , and in @xmath67 , expression ( [ mt ] ) . the first term ( the first line in expressions  ( [ ft]),([mt ] ) ) is related to the bound state and the second term ( containing the integration over @xmath71 ) is related to the excited states . because of the continuous character of the excited states as a function of @xmath71 , the terms related to the excited states vanish for large times .",
    "we find that for large @xmath72 , the conversion from ` slow ' to ` fast ' fermions is greatly reduced .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that for large @xmath72 , @xmath73 becomes very small ( as can be seen in fig .",
    "2 ) and the initial state coincides nearly with an eigenstate of the system , @xmath74 so that @xmath75 and @xmath66 remains close to 1 ( its initial value ) .    the fraction of ` slow ' molecules or ` slow ' fermionic atoms , obtained from ( [ ft ] ) and ( [ mt ] ) respectively , displays damped oscillations resulting from the interference between the terms related to the bound state and the terms related to the excited states .",
    "3 shows the evolution of the densities of ` slow ' fermionic atoms and ` slow ' molecules for different values of the molecular binding energy @xmath44 and mass @xmath76 . for the chosen values of the mass , the oscillations are visible for negative molecular binding energy @xmath77 , while for @xmath44 positive they are strongly damped .",
    "we observed that the larger @xmath78 the fewer molecules are formed .",
    "indeed , according to fermi s golden rule , a bigger reduced mass means a faster dissociation rate ( @xmath79 ) of the of molecules .",
    "remarkably , also for @xmath80 , the fraction of ` slow ' fermions reduces substantially over time even though at all times few molecules that can dissociate to ` fast ' fermionic atoms are present .",
    "this effect can be understood since , even though few molecules are present at any time , they form and dissociate quickly .",
    "this raises the question whether our approximate wave function ( [ psi ] ) is good enough . for low @xmath76",
    ", it is obvious that the dissociation of molecules will be slow and strong rabi oscillations between fermionic atoms and molecules occur .",
    "the third term of ( [ psi ] ) , containing the factor @xmath81 * , * is then relatively unimportant and corrections on it will not affect the result a lot . for high @xmath76 ,",
    "the molecules dissociate rapidly and the contribution to @xmath82 coming from the pairs of ` fast ' fermionic atoms and bosons ( last term from equation ( [ psi ] ) ) must be big .",
    "but in this case the corrections to the contribution of these pairs through new formation of fast molecules out of a fast fermionic atom are small , because few of those molecules are formed .",
    "diagrammatically , this means that diagrams such as those in fig .",
    "1  ( b ) are negligible . then for intermediate @xmath76",
    "one can also expect ( [ psi ] ) to be a good approximation , at least in order to calculate the fraction of ` slow ' fermions .      to check whether the picture described here , with fermions that form a bound state with the condensate , is correct , one has to be able to measure preferably the fraction of ` slow ' fermionic atoms .",
    "this should , after some transient behavior , go to a constant value and not to zero .",
    "they can be detected by a time of flight expansion after a magnetic pulse has been applied .    in @xmath0k-@xmath1rb",
    "plenty of feshbach resonances have been predicted @xcite allowing us to estimate quantitatively the magnitude of the model parameters .",
    "therefore , we make use of @xmath83 , with @xmath3 the background scattering length . as an example we take the resonance between the @xmath84 hyperfine states around @xmath85 .",
    "for @xmath86 the frequency @xmath87 is  equal to @xmath88 , which is much larger than the harmonic oscillator frequency .",
    "thus we can expect that the confinement is relatively unimportant for the atom - molecule oscillations .",
    "we find in this case @xmath89 and further @xmath90 the values used for the parameters of fig .",
    "3 are for this resonance with @xmath91 and @xmath92 on the left , and on the right for the @xmath93 hyperfine states with a feshbach resonance around @xmath94 .",
    "the current results have been derived in the framework of a translation invariant system whereas in the experimental setup the inhomogeneity of the trapped gasses is apparent . the time evolution has been calculated for homogeneous mixtures , and it is necessary to estimate what the effects due to the confinement are . considering the case with much more bosons than fermions , we can neglect in a first approximation the change of the boson density",
    ". then one can find in a mean - field approximation the redistribution speed of the fermions in the trap .",
    "the local density approximation is applicable only if during the time scale of a rabi oscillation between the fermionic atom state and the molecular state , the fermions have not moved over a substantial fraction of the trap length . in the thomas - fermi approximation for the bosons ,",
    "the mean field potential felt by a fermion is @xmath95 with @xmath96 the condensate density in the origin and @xmath97 the radius of the condensate .",
    "this results in an additional confinement potential ( inverted for @xmath98 ) acting on the fermions . for the resonance used above , for @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xmath101 m and making use of ( [ ascatt ] ) ,",
    "its frequency equals @xmath102  for @xmath44 not too small , this is much lower than the frequency scale of the molecule formation @xmath103 which means that the dynamics due to molecule formation is fast compared to the mean - field collapse , and the local density approximation can be used . for @xmath104 ,",
    "an atom migrates 10% of the trap length in 0.75 ms whereas the period of a rabi oscillation is around 1.3 @xmath101s@xmath18    within the approximations described above , we plot in fig .",
    "4 the density of slow fermions as a function of time and distance from the center of the trapping potential in the case that the fermion cloud has a radius 1.5 times bigger than the condensate . to use the formalism presented above , space was subdivided in discrete boxes in which the gases were presumed homogeneous , as in the local density approximation . as discussed above , no redistribution of fermions across volume elements is considered so that each volume element can be treated independently of the others . in the lower panels , the total fraction , averaged over space , of ` slow ' fermionic atoms",
    "is compared to the local fraction of ` slow ' fermionic atoms in the center of the trap .",
    "one can see that the inhomogeneity decreases the amplitude of the oscillations in the total fraction of ` slow ' fermionic atoms .",
    "the reason is that the condensate is the most dense in the middle , which increases the efficiency of the atom - molecule conversion , and also because @xmath105 and @xmath106 depend on @xmath107 so that on different places in the condensate oscillations with different frequencies occur .",
    "we have made a study of the dynamics of a fermion - boson mixture resulting from a fast switch in the magnetic field , bringing it close to an interspecies feshbach resonance .",
    "our analysis shows that damped oscillations between fermionic atoms and molecules will occur on the typical time scale of @xmath108 ( @xmath109s for a @xmath0k-@xmath1rb mixture)@xmath18 such a type of oscillations have recently been observed in single component bec s near a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "the decay of the molecules in pairs of ` fast ' fermionic atoms and bosons leads to heating of the system , but a core of ` slow ' fermions will remain , due to the existence of a bound state of the fermions coupled to the condensate and the continuum of thermal bosons . using the latest data on resonances in @xmath110k-@xmath1rb scattering @xcite , we find that the predicted oscillations between slow fermions and slow molecules should be observable both in a homogeneous and inhomogeneous system .",
    "the redistribution of the densities are expected to occur much slower than these oscillations .",
