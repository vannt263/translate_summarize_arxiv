    "the kondo effect results from exchange interaction of itinerant electrons with a localized spin state .",
    "this interaction leads to local spin polarization of the electron gas .",
    "the polarization becomes significant only at low temperatures , due to the existence of collective states@xcite with small excitation energies .",
    "simultaneously with the modification of the spin susceptibility , the scattering properties are modified significantly from those of the original localized spin state .",
    "the modification is especially striking in the case of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction , when the `` spin cloud '' formed out of free electron gas tends to screen the magnetic moment of the localized state . in this case",
    ", the scattering cross - section grows as the temperature is being lowered , and reaches the unitary limit at @xmath8 .",
    "this phenomenon is responsible for the non - monotonic temperature behavior of the resistivity of metals with magnetic impurities at low temperatures , which was the first experimentally observed manifestation of the kondo resonance.@xcite however , the system of magnetic impurities embedded in a metal sample does not offer much control over the parameters even at the stage of the fabrication of the sample , not speaking of the dynamic variation of the parameters in the course of an experiment .",
    "another class of systems , whose transport properties can also be affected by the kondo effect , but which offer a much higher level of control over the system parameters , is provided by quantum dots .",
    "a quantum dot in a semiconductor planar heterostructure is a confined few - electron system contacted by sheets of two - dimensional electron gas ( leads ) .",
    "if the total number of electrons on the dot is odd , then the dot is similar to a magnetic impurity .",
    "junctions between the dot and the leads produce an overlap of the states in the dot and in the 2d leads .",
    "this overlap leads to the exchange interaction between the spin of the dot and spins of the itinerant 2d electrons . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "the `` spin cloud '' is formed of the electrons in the leads .",
    "like in bulk metals , the scattering off the resulting many - body state is being enhanced as the temperature is being lowered , and reaches unitary limit at @xmath8 .",
    "different are only the manifestations of the kondo resonance in bulk metals and in the quantum dot systems . in bulk metals ,",
    "the enhancement of scattering by the kondo resonance increases the resistivity . in quantum dot systems , on the contrary , the scattering facilitates transport through the dot .",
    "kondo effect results in a specific temperature dependence of the linear conductance across the dot .",
    "if temperature is lowered , the conductance first drops due to the coulomb blockade phenomenon,@xcite and then increases again due to the kondo effect.@xcite at @xmath8 , the conductance @xmath4 reaches its maximum , which corresponds to the unitary limit of tunneling .",
    "recently , the kondo effect in a quantum dot was observed experimentally.@xcite    the quantum dot devices are highly controllable , and can be operated in regimes inaccessible in the conventional magnetic impurity systems , that were used previously for studying the kondo effect",
    ". irradiation of a quantum dot with an ac field offers a new , clever way of affecting its dynamics , which enables one to study the kondo anomaly in essentially non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "the ac field can be applied to the gate , thus modulating the dot s potential with respect to the leads ; alternatively , one may apply ac bias to the leads . in any case , driving the system out of equilibrium affects the dc conductance discussed above . measuring the dc @xmath9 characteristics , one can investigate the effects of the irradiation on the kondo anomaly .    a generic theoretical description of a quantum dot operates with a significant number of parameters and energy scales describing the system .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of no ac field , it turns out that the low - energy properties of the quantum dot system which are related to the kondo effect are controlled by only one relevant energy scale , which is the kondo temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the kondo temperature , in turn , depends on the microscopic parameters of the system , _",
    "e.g. _ , on the gate voltage and conductances of the dot - lead junctions .",
    "such universality allows for easier understanding and description of the problem .",
    "the ac field introduces new parameters to the problem , thus apparently breaking the universal description , which is valid in the static case .",
    "this re - emerging abundance of parameters makes it difficult to build a consistent description of the effects of the ac field on the kondo conductance . the theoretical work performed up to the date , was concentrated on some specific regimes .",
    "goldin and avishai@xcite considered the case of very strong ac bias with the help of the third - order perturbation theory in the dot - lead coupling .",
    "et al._@xcite analyzed the effects of ac field of sufficiently high frequency , which ionizes the dot .",
    "they have conjectured that even at the temperature of the thermal bath @xmath10 , the finite rate of the dot ionization results in a finite effective temperature `` seen '' by the kondo state . this way , irradiation provides the cut - off for the kondo singularity and reduces the conductance .",
    "later , we have demonstrated@xcite that even in the absence of the dot ionization , irradiation is able to flip the spin of the dot , thus bringing decoherence into the kondo state and diminishing the kondo effect .",
    "in addition to analytical methods , a number of numerical approaches have been used@xcite to study the conductance of a kondo system out of equilibrium at certain sets of values of the bare parameters of the system .",
    "because of the large number of the parameters involved , the results of such calculations are hard to analyze . at any rate , such a limited consideration could not reveal the universalities of the problem . in our view , it also does not provide an insight into the regimes which do not allow for a perturbative treatment .    in our earlier paper@xcite",
    "we have learned how to apply the renormalization group ( rg ) technique for a kondo system out of equilibrium .",
    "it allowed us to sum up the infinite series of the perturbation theory in the dot lead coupling .",
    "this treatment , valid at relatively high decoherence rates , yielded the expression for the conductance as a function of only one parameter , which is the ratio of the decoherence rate @xmath11 to the kondo temperature .",
    "thus we established that the kondo temperature @xmath3 remains a meaningful parameter of the theory , even if the ac field strongly suppresses the manifestations of the kondo effect .",
    "we do not see a way , however , of measuring the decoherence rate directly .",
    "moreover , the definition of this quantity in ref .   makes sense only at a sufficiently high frequency of the ac field , @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the dimensionless ratio @xmath13 can not be the only parameter describing the effect of ac field on the kondo system .    in this paper",
    ", we find the correct dimensionless variables that characterize the amplitude and frequency of the ac field perturbing the kondo system .",
    "if the ac field biases the dot , then the proper variables are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the amplitude of the ac bias . in the case of ac modulation of the gate voltage",
    ", the perturbation introduced by the ac field is characterized by the corresponding dimensionless variation of the kondo temperature @xmath17 , which in principle can be independently measured . in terms of the proper pair of variables ,",
    "the behavior of the kondo conductance is universal .",
    "we find analytically the asymptotes of the universal dependence by further developing the rg treatment ( valid in the case of strong suppression of the kondo effect ) , and by generalizing the nozires fermi - liquid theory@xcite onto the non - equilibrium case ( which adequately describes the limit of weak perturbation by a low - frequency field ) .    within this picture ,",
    "we are able to describe in a consistent way the effect of irradiation in a wide range of frequencies of the ac perturbation - from zero to the dot ionization threshold ; this includes the most interesting for the current experiments@xcite region @xmath18 .",
    "the remarkable feature of the presented description is that the kondo temperature remains the only relevant energy scale , despite the essentially non - equilibrium character of the problem .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hams ] we introduce the description of the system by means of the time - dependent kondo hamiltonian . then we derive the expression for the kondo conductance of the dot in the absence of ac field .",

    "weak][sec : sum1 ] we consider the effect of ac modulation of the gate voltage on the kondo conductance . at higher frequencies ,",
    "@xmath19 , the decoherence of the kondo many - body state is the principal channel via which the ac field influences the kondo anomaly .",
    "this frequency domain is considered in sections  [ sec : weak][sec : crossover ] .",
    "depending on the strength of modulation , @xmath17 , the suppression of the kondo conductance is significant ( section  [ sec : weak ] ) , or relatively weak ( sections  [ sec : crossover ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : strong ] we consider the limit of very small frequencies of the ac field .",
    "the decoherence probability in these conditions is exponentially small .",
    "however , the adiabatic evolution of the collective state , caused by the ac modulation , affects its scattering properties .",
    "it results in small deviation of the conductance from the unitary limit .",

    "this frequency dependence is opposite to the one in the case of gate voltage modulation .    in sec .",

    "the system we study is a quantum dot attached to two leads by high - resistance junctions , so that the charge of the dot is nearly quantized .",

    "( [ gamma ] ) , where @xmath29 is the density of states in a lead .",
    "the ac field can be applied to the gate , which is coupled to the dot capacitively , and thus can modulate the energy of the electron localized in the dot with the amplitude @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that the leads can be either only dc - biased , or an additional ac bias can be applied .      in the present paper",
    "we consider the dot in the kondo regime , @xmath31 . under such conditions ,",
    "the number of electrons on the dot is a well - defined quantity . in the limit of",

    "<S> we demonstrate that the dot out of equilibrium is also characterized by a universal behavior : conductance @xmath4 depends on the ac field only through two dimensionless parameters , which are the frequency @xmath6 and the amplitude of the ac perturbation , both divided by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find analytically the large- and small - frequency asymptotes of the universal dependence of @xmath4 on these parameters . </S>",
