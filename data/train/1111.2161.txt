    "lattice excitations named electromagnons have been discovered in multiferroics , where the magnetic order coexists with the ferroelectric one.@xcite electromagnons are excited by the electric component * * e**@xmath7 of the electromagnetic radiation , therefore they can be detected in the thz dielectric permittivity spectra . though they were theoretically predicted in 1970,@xcite the first experimental confirmation appeared as late as in 2006.@xcite these excitations",

    "a general feature of type - ii multiferroic materials is that the ferroelectric phase is induced by magnetic ordering characterized by a particular type of incommensurate spiral magnetic structure . in this case",
    "the magnetically - induced polarization is by several orders of magnitude smaller than in type - i multiferroics .",
    "however the coupling between electric and magnetic subsystems is large and giant magnetoelectric effects are observed .",
    "the magnon dispersion branch in the incommensurate phase exhibits a minimum at the wave vector * q@xmath11 * corresponding to the modulation vector of the ordered spins .",
    "in contrast to the magnetic resonance ( magnon at * * q**@xmath120 ) characterized by sharp spectral features , the electromagnons manifest themselves as very broad spectral bands because their activation in the dielectric spectra is closely related to the high density of states close to the extrema of the magnon dispersion branches .",
    "since the probing thz radiation has a long wavelength ( i.e. the wave vector * * q**@xmath120 ) , the electromagnons can not be excited by a resonant single - photon absorption due to the wave vector conservation law ; in this sense polar phonons should be involved in the interaction process .",
    "an experimentally observed low - frequency electromagnon in type - ii multiferroics was found to be related to the spin waves near the magnetic brillouin zone ( bz ) center with * * q**=*q@xmath11 * @xcite or to those with * * q**=**q**@xmath13 - 2**q@xmath11 * * ; @xcite here * * q**@xmath13 stands for the wave vector at the bz edge . in both cases",
    "the low - frequency electromagnon has a similar frequency as the magnon with q=0 which is expected because all these excitations are related to the same magnon branch .",
    "a high - frequency electromagnon corresponds to an excitation of the bz - edge magnons ( * * q**=**q**@xmath13 ) which can induce a quasi - uniform modulation ( * * q**@xmath120 ) of the local electric dipole moment.@xcite as for mechanisms of the electromagnon excitations , some researchers claim that the low - frequency electromagnons are activated by the inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya mechanism , while the high - frequency one by the heisenberg exchange coupling.@xcite other authors believe that both types of electromagnons can be explained by the heisenberg exchange coupling.@xcite    formerly , it was assumed that the electromagnons can be activated only in type - ii multiferroics due to the large magnetoelectric coupling .",
    "nevertheless , electromagnons were recently observed also in bifeo@xmath0 , @xcite which is the most prominent type - i multiferroic with a rather weak magnetoelectric coupling . in this context",

    "however , piezomagnetic and magnetoelastic couplings , and higher - order magnetoelectric couplings are allowed.@xcite the piezomagnetic coupling is characterized by a bilinear interaction between the magnetic order parameter and strain , in contrast to the magnetoelastic coupling which is proportional to the product of squared order parameter and strain.@xcite by using the method of optical second harmonic generation,@xcite the piezomagnetic coupling was observed owing to the interaction between afm and fe domain walls in ymno@xmath0.@xcite switching of the fe polarization triggers a reversal of the afm order parameter.@xcite higher order magnetoelectric coupling in ymno@xmath0 has been observed in several works .",
    "exceptionally large atomic displacements at @xmath16 were observed in structural studies and they demonstrate unusually strong magnetoelastic coupling.@xcite the large spin  polar - phonon coupling manifests itself by a decrease of the low - frequency permittivity@xcite near @xmath3 which is probably caused by anomalous hardening of several infrared - active phonons@xcite .",
    "similar phonon anomalies were observed near @xmath3 also in the raman spectra.@xcite ultrasound measurements on a single crystal of the hexagonal ymno@xmath0 showed anomalous behavior of the elastic moduli @xmath17 and @xmath18 due to a strong coupling of the lattice with the in - plane exchange interaction.@xcite    the afm resonance in hexagonal ymno@xmath0 crystal was first observed and briefly ( without any figures ) reported in ref .  .",

    "moreover , a possible existence of magnons and short - range correlations between spins at mn sites in paramagnetic phase were indicated by ins.@xcite the magnetoelastic coupling manifests itself also by a strong mixing of magnons with acoustic phonons ; this leads to a gap in the transverse acoustic ( ta ) phonon branch occurring at the frequencies and wave vectors where the uncoupled magnon and ta branches would intersect.@xcite recent polarized ins measurements revealed that the excitation detected at liquid helium temperatures near 43@xmath4 has a mixed character of magnetic spin wave and lattice vibration,@xcite i.e. its contribution to both the magnetic permeability and the dielectric permittivity is possible .",

    "an additional broad and weak absorption band was observed in the same frequency range in the dielectric spectra both below and above t@xmath19 .",
    "in contrast to electromagnons which are typically observed only below 50k , the oscillator strength of this excitation significantly increases on heating when room temperature is approached .",

    "additional absorption band with similar temperature behavior was observed also near 100@xmath4 .",

    "the processes we observe in ymno@xmath0 , where the linear magnetoelectric coupling is forbidden , are clearly different from the one responsible for the appearance of electromagnons in multiferroics with spin - induced ferroelectricity.@xcite the multiphonon absorptions are allowed by symmetry in all dielectric systems , while paramagnon - phonon absorptions can be expected only in paramagnetic systems with a strong short - range magnetic order ( e.g. in hexagonal manganites ) .",
    "magnon - phonon absorption should be also detectable in all magnetically ordered systems ( fm , afm , ferrimagnets etc . ) with relatively high critical temperatures .",
    "in such conditions the magnons at the brillouin zone edge may become sufficiently populated to allow multiparticle effects in the spectra .",
    "this may stimulate further thz and fir studies of other magnetically polarizable systems .",

    "<S> terahertz and far - infrared electric and magnetic responses of hexagonal piezomagnetic ymno@xmath0 single crystals are investigated . </S>",

    "<S> this excitation softens from 41 to 32@xmath4 on heating and finally disappears above @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> an additional weak and heavily - damped excitation is seen in the spectra of complex dielectric permittivity @xmath5 within the same frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> this excitation contributes to the dielectric spectra in both antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases . </S>",
    "<S> its oscillator strength significantly increases on heating towards room temperature thus providing evidence of piezomagnetic or higher - order couplings to polar phonons . </S>",
    "<S> other heavily - damped dielectric excitations are detected near 100@xmath4 in the paramagnetic phase in both @xmath5 and @xmath6 spectra and they exhibit similar temperature behavior . these excitations appearing in the frequency range of magnon branches well below polar phonons could remind electromagnons ; however , their temperature dependence is quite different . we have used density functional theory for calculating phonon dispersion branches in the whole brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of these results and of previously published magnon dispersion branches brought us to the conclusion that the observed absorption bands stem from phonon - phonon and phonon - paramagnon differential absorption processes . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is enabled by a strong short - range in - plane spin correlations in the paramagnetic phase . </S>"
