    "in a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) , strong coulomb interactions between electrons can lead to exotic phenomena such as the wigner crystal state ,  @xcite the fractional quantum hall effect ,  @xcite and the anomalous 2d metallic state .",
    "@xcite one route to studying the role played by coulomb interactions is to limit their length - scale using a metallic ground - plane located close to the 2des .",
    "@xcite this approach was first used in studies of the melting of the wigner crystal state formed in electrons on a liquid he surface .",
    "@xcite more recently , it has been used to study the role of coulomb interactions in the insulating  @xcite and metallic  @xcite regimes of a 2d hole system ( 2dhs ) formed in an algaas / gaas heterostructure .    whereas the study of coulomb interactions in the insulating regime  @xcite was achieved quite straightforwardly using a metal surface gate separated from the 2dhs by @xmath0 nm ( see fig .  [ fig1](a ) ) , the corresponding study in the metallic regime could not be achieved in this way .",
    "this is because the higher hole density @xmath1 in the metallic regime requires that the distance @xmath2 between the 2dhs and ground - plane be comparable to the carrier spacing ( @xmath3 nm ) to achieve effective screening , and at the same time that the 2dhs be deep enough in the heterostructure ( @xmath4 nm ) to achieve a mobility sufficient to observe the metallic behavior . to overcome this challenge ,",
    "a double quantum well heterostructure was used ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) such that the 2dhs formed in the upper quantum well ( screening layer ) served as the ground - plane for the lower quantum well ( transport layer ) , enabling the measurement of a @xmath5 nm deep , high mobility 2dhs separated by only @xmath6 nm from a ground - plane .",

    "@xcite . in ( b ) , there are two possible ground - plane configurations . in the first , the gate is grounded and the 2d system acts as the ground - plane . in the second ,",
    "the gate is biased to deplete the upper 2d system , and the gate then acts as the ground - plane instead .",
    "this allows the distance between the transport layer and the ground - plane to be varied _ in situ _  for more details , see ref .",
    "14 .    in considering experiments on screening in double quantum well systems , a natural question to ask is whether a 2d system is as effective as a metal gate when used as a ground - plane to screen coulomb interactions between carriers in a nearby 2d system .",
    "this is important given that the screening charge in a 2d system is restricted to two dimensions and the density of states is several orders of magnitude smaller than in a metal film . in this paper",
    ", we perform calculations of the screening effect of a ground - plane on a 2d system for two cases : the first where the ground - plane is a metal and the second where it is a 2d system .",
    "we begin using the thomas - fermi approximation in the absence of intralayer screening in the transport layer to show that a 2d system is at least as effective as a metal gate as a ground - plane for the experiment in ref .  14 .",
    "we also compare the experiments in the insulating  @xcite and metallic  @xcite regimes of a 2d hole system in the thomas - fermi approximation , to explain why the ground - plane has less effect in the metallic regime compared to the insulating regime .",
    "finally , since the experiment by ho _",
    "_ was performed at @xmath7 , where the thomas - fermi approximation begins to break down , we extend our model to account for exchange and finite thickness effects to see how these affect the conclusions from the thomas - fermi model .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive the dielectric functions for screening of a 2d hole system by a metal gate and another nearby 2d hole system . in section iii ,",
    "we compare the various dielectric functions numerically and discuss their implications for the ground - plane screening experiments of 2d systems in the insulating  @xcite and metallic  @xcite regimes .",
    "conclusions will be presented in section iv . for readers unfamiliar with the intricacies of screening in 2d systems",
    ", we give a brief introduction to the screening theory for a single 2d system in appendix a to aid them in understanding the theory developed in sect .",
    "ii . in appendix b",
    ", we compare our model accounting for exchange and finite thickness effects to related works on many - body physics in double quantum well structures . in appendix c",
    "we show how our analysis of ground plane screening can be related to previous work on bilayer 2d systems that have studied the compressibility .",
    "in contrast to experiments on ground - plane screening of the interactions within a 2d system,@xcite previous experiments on bilayer 2d systems have examined the compressibility of a 2d system by studying penetration of an electric field applied perpendicular to the 2d plane@xcite .",
    "we show that although these two screening configurations have quite distinct geometries , our model is consistent with widely used analysis@xcite describing the penetration of a perpendicular electric field through a 2d system .    in the calculations that follow , we use linear screening theory and the static dielectric function approximation ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we assume for convenience that the 2d systems contain holes ( electron results can be obtained with appropriate corrections for charge and mass ) to facilitate direct connection with recent experimental results in algaas / gaas heterostructures .",
    "@xcite we also assume that tunneling between the two quantum wells is negligible and ignore any coulomb drag effects ( i.e. , interlayer exchange and correlations ) .",
    "we now begin considering the screening effect of a nearby ground - plane on a 2d system ( transport layer ) for two different configurations . in",
    "the first , the ground - plane ( i.e. , screening layer ) is a metal surface gate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) and in the second , the ground - plane is another 2d system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) . in both cases",
    "the transport and screening layers are separated by a distance @xmath2 .    ,",
    "width=321 ]    schematics showing the two systems considered in this paper .",
    "the transport layer is screened by ( a ) a metal surface gate and ( b ) a second 2d system . in both cases",
    "the screening layer is separated by a distance @xmath2 from the transport layer , and the transport ( 1 ) and screening ( 2 ) layers have independent potentials @xmath9 and charge densities @xmath10 .    if we consider some positive external test charge @xmath11 added to the transport layer , this leads to induced charge in both the transport layer @xmath12 ( as in appendix a ) and in the screening layer @xmath13 .",
    "note however that no external charge is added to the screening layer , so @xmath14 and @xmath15 , whereas @xmath16 .",
    "how we deal with the induced charge in the screening layer differs in the two cases . in both cases ,",
    "we consider the transport layer and a 2nd layer of charge a distance _ d _ above it ; each layer having a potential and charge density of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , respectively . for a metal surface gate",
    ", we can use the standard image charge approach ,  @xcite which involves considering the induced charge in the screening layer as a 2d layer of negative ` image ' charges located a distance @xmath21 away from the transport layer .",
    "this results in @xmath22 for a metal gate .",
    "the image charge approach assumes that the ground - plane is a perfect metal .",
    "this assumption is relatively well satisfied by a typical metal surface gate ( au gate @xmath23 nm thick ) but not by a 2d system .",
    "thus when a 2d system is used as the screening layer , we can not assume an added induced negative image charge as we can for the metal .",
    "instead , we account for screening by a 2d system by directly calculating its induced charge , which is located in the screening layer ( i.e. , at a distance @xmath24 ) .",
    "this results in @xmath25 for a 2d screening layer , where @xmath26 is the polarizability , which describes how much @xmath27 is produced in response to the addition of @xmath28 .",
    "note that we are only considering the case where the both 2d layers are of the same type of charge ( e.g. , a bilayer 2dhs ) .",
    "charge in one layer leads to a potential in the other via the interlayer coulomb interaction :  @xcite    @xmath29 = e^{-qd}v(q)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 is the intralayer coulomb interaction , @xmath31 is the distance between the two layers , and @xmath32 is the fourier transform . if the screening layer is a metal @xmath21 , and @xmath33 if it is a 2d system .",
    "the resulting potential in the transport layer then becomes :    @xmath34    we discuss how to obtain @xmath35 in section ii .",
    "a. the effectiveness of the screening is obtained from the modified dielectric function @xmath36 , which we define as the inverse of the ratio of the screened potential to the unscreened potential for the transport layer :    @xmath37    the dielectric function for the transport layer can be obtained for three possible configurations : no screening layer ( i.e. , just a single 2d system ) , a 2d screening layer and a metal screening layer , which we denote as @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "@xmath38 is the conventional dielectric function for a single 2d system , and can be recovered by taking the limit @xmath41 for either @xmath39 or @xmath40 , as we show in section ii part c. if one wanted to take transport theory for a single layer , and consider the effects of ground plane screening , it is only necessary to replace @xmath38 with @xmath39 or @xmath40 to take into account the screening effect of a 2d or metal ground plane , respectively .",
    "we will now obtain the various @xmath42 using an approach involving the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite and thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation .",
    "@xcite at first we will ignore ( sect .",
    "iia ) and later include ( sect .",

    "finally , in sect .",
    "iic , we will extend the model for a 2d screening layer to account for its behavior at lower densities , to confirm that our conclusions from the simpler calculations are robust .",
    "we begin by considering the case where there is no intralayer screening in the transport layer .",
    "this is useful because it allows a straightforward comparison of the effectiveness of the 2dhs as a ground - plane , without the obscuring effect of intralayer screening . to do this calculation ,",
    "we set @xmath43 , such that @xmath44 . in other words",

    "[ eqn4 ] then gives the dielectric function for the metal gate :    @xmath49    where the additional subscript @xmath50 denotes that intralayer screening has been ignored .",
    "for a 2d screening layer , the dielectric function is obtained self - consistently through the rpa as follows .",
    "the induced charge is related to the screening layer potential by :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the polarizability of the screening layer , normally given by the 2d lindhard function .",

    "[ eqn12 ] .      following our relatively simple treatment of ground - plane screening above , it is now interesting to ask how the results of our calculations change if we extend our model to account for two phenomena ignored in our thomas - fermi model : exchange effects at low densities , and the finite thickness of the screening and transport layers .",
    "the thomas - fermi approximation works well when the interaction parameter @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the effective bohr radius .",
    "however , it is not as accurate for 2d systems at lower densities , such as those used in our experiment @xcite , where the interaction parameters for the screening and transport layers were @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively . at such low densities",

    "secondly , our calculations provide an explanation for why ground - plane screening has much more effect in the insulating regime than it did in the metallic regime . due to the low hole density and conductivity in the insulating regime ,",
    "intralayer screening is weak and the dominant contribution to screening is the ground - plane , which acts to limit the length scale of the coulomb interactions .",
    "this results in the ground - plane having a marked effect on the transport properties of the 2d system , as shown by huang _",
    "et al_.  @xcite in the metallic regime , intralayer screening can not be ignored .",
    "in addition to being the dominant contribution for long - range interactions ( i.e. , at small @xmath113 ) , the intralayer screening contribution is non - zero over a much wider range of @xmath113 , turning the ground - plane contribution into little more than a small change to the overall screening in the 2d system , which is consistent with the experiment by ho _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "finally , since both experiments were performed at @xmath111 , where the thomas - fermi approximation is invalid , we reconsider our calculations involving 2d systems using the hubbard approximation for the local field correction .",
    "we show that our argument regarding the physics of ground - plane screening in the metallic and insulating regimes remains robust , but that exchange effects lead to a 2d system being _ more _ effective than a metal layer as a ground - plane .",
    "this is due to the exchange - driven negative compressibility that occurs@xcite at @xmath167 .",
    "while our results suggest that ground - plane effects on a metallic transport layer should strengthen as the ground - plane separation @xmath124 is reduced , there are a number of issues that complicate this argument .",

    "this would allow us to reduce @xmath137 without changing @xmath2 , thus avoiding the problems above .",
