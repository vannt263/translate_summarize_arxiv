    "distance measurement has been historically one of the most fundamental challenges in astronomy . to measure cosmic distances from the earth s surface",
    "we must generally rely on parallaxes , i.e.  the apparent change in position of an object relative to some other object ( or reference frame ) brought about by a known displacement of the observer .",
    "astronomical distance measurement is hard because these displacements ( e.g.  the motion of the earth around the sun ) are small compared to the distances we want to measure ( e.g.  the distance to the galactic centre ) , that is we need to measure very small angular changes in position .",
    "the lack of accurate distances has been , and continues to be , one of the most significant limitations in studying the universe .",
    "the topic of this conference ",
    "the transit of venus across the sun  is central to this issue , because the attempts to observe it were a milestone in observational astronomy and in our potential to measure distances . following first halley s and then deslise s outline of a method to measure the solar parallax ( and hence the astronomical unit , au ) from timing a venus transit , numerous expeditions were mounted to observe the four transits occurring during the 18th and 19th centuries . while the degree of accuracy and consistency of these methods in determining the au were not as high as hoped or expected ( for reasons discussed elsewhere in this volume ) , they nonetheless made a vital contribution .",
    "the timing of transits , for example , was an ingenious addition to our otherwise limited way of measuring cosmic distances .",
    "now , some 370 years after the first transit observations of mercury and venus in the 1630s , distance measurement in the universe remains a fundamental issue in astronomy .",
    "it is vital for understanding the structure and evolution of stars , the formation and composition of our galaxy and ultimately for tracing the origin of the universe .",
    "almost all aspects of astrophysics rely to some degree on accurate distances , and this ultimately relies on astrometry : the measurement of positions over time and derivations of parallaxes and proper motions from them .",
    "the gaia mission will mark a significant step forward in astrometry .",
    "following in the wake of the very successful hipparcos mission ( esa 1997 ) , gaia will extend hipparcos capabilities by several orders of magnitudes and through this make significant breakthroughs in numerous astrophysical topics .",
    "table  [ comparison ] gives a brief comparison of the main capabilities of gaia compared to hipparcos .    in this contribution",
    "i summarise the main aspects of the satellite , its mission and its observational principles , and provide a sample of expected science contributions . for further information the reader is referred to the concept study report ( esa 2001 ) and its summary ( perryman 2001 ) .",
    "i will say little about the radial velocity spectrograph on board gaia : for this see the contribution in this volume by mark cropper .",

    "a brief overview of gaia s capabilities and likely contributions in five scientific fields is now presented . for more information and references",
    "see the gaia concept and technology study report ( esa 2000 ) and the summary by perryman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , from which much of this section has been drawn . for more up - to - date information see the gaia website ` http://www.rssd.esa.int/gaia `      due to its high proper motion sensitivity , gaia will detect numerous minor planets in our solar system .",
    "in particular it is expected that it will detect some 10@xmath210@xmath3 new objects in the main asteroid belt , compared to fewer than @xmath4 currently known .",
    "the detailed statistics of orbital elements so derived can be used to investigate the formation of the solar system .",
    "knowing their distances , the apparent magnitudes of asteroids can be used to derive their albedos .",
    "the medium and broad band photometry from gaia will be used to classify asteroids and thus derive their chemical compositions .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that during the lifetime of gaia some 100 close mutual encounters will be observed and their open ( hyperbolic ) orbits traced : from this asteroid masses can be determined .",
    "this would increase the number of directly ( i.e.dynamically ) determined asteroid masses from the present number of about 20 .",
    "combined with size measurements from stellar occultations , densities may be derived , thus providing insight into their chemical composition and thus that of the primordial solar environment .    because gaia will be able to observe nearer to the sun ( within 40 ) and which much higher accuracy than is possible from the ground",
    ", it will make important contributions toward the study of near earth objects ( neos ) .",
    "some of these asteroids , such as those of the apollo and athen groups , cross the earth s orbit and so are potentially at risk of collision . as gaia performs real - time onboard detection , it will detect and observe such objects many times over the course of its mission",
    ". it should be able to discover and determine accurate orbits for all neos with diameters larger than a few hundred metres .",
    "the trojans are asteroids situated around the lagrange l@xmath5 and l@xmath6 points of planets , where stable orbits can be maintained for hundreds of millions of years .",
    "planetary perturbations and mutual close encounters mean that they can have orbits elongated around the l@xmath5 and l@xmath6 points of their ` host ' planet .",
    "trojans are known for the outer planets , but in the inner solar systems the only known ones are two martian trojans .",
    "it is still not known whether the trojans were captured or formed in situ , or even whether they have similar compositions to the main belt asteroids . due to the large area it covers ,",
    "gaia will undertake a systematic survey for the trojans of all planets , including , for the first time , for venus .",
    "gaia will just about be sensitive enough to detect the very faint , red population in the edgeworth - kuiper belt ( ekb ) .",
    "the ekb , situated around 40au from the sun , is a population of icy bodies which appear to be a remnant of the formation of the solar system .",
    "pluto is its largest member .",
    "an improved census of the ekb members , their orbits and intrinsic properties will provide further insight into the formation of planetary systems .",
    "although gaia s sensitivity will not permit detections of large numbers of these very faint , cold objects , it is predicted to discover some 50 new objects . of these",
    ", 510 are expected to be binaries .      through its high precision , multi - epoch astrometry gaia will be able to detect the positional ` wobble ' of a star due to the gravitational force of a companion . not only",
    "will this allow gaia to detect hundreds of millions of visually unresolved binary stars , but the sensitivity is high enough to detect motions caused by planetary mass companions . to date , most exoplanets have been detected by the radial velocity method , i.e.  the variable doppler shift of spectral lines induced by relative motions , although a few have been detected by astrometry ( see the article by f.benedict in this volume ) and via photometric detection of transits .",
    "the astrometric amplitude of the motion of a star of mass @xmath7 due a planet of mass @xmath8 orbiting at a distance @xmath9 is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the distance to the system from the earth .",
    "for example , the 47 ursa majoris system is predicted to give an amplitude of 360 .",
    "the astrometric method is most sensitive to large or long period orbits , which is the opposite of the radial velocity ( rv ) technique .",
    "therefore the techniques are complementary .",
    "but because the astrometric signature is observed in a two - dimensional plane we can determine the inclination of the keplerian orbit .",
    "this allows a determination of the mass of the planet without the @xmath12 ambiguity inherent to the rv technique ( in which we only observe the projected orbital velocities ) . for the rv method ) if we assume a mass for the star : just astrometry or rv alone does not allow us to determine the individual masses of unresolved systems .",
    "however , in many cases , the stellar mass can be determined with reasonable accuracy from gaia s photometry . ]",
    "gaia will be most useful for finding planets around stars with v@xmath13 , with good capabilities out to about d=200pc .",
    "this covers a vast number of stars  around 100000 ,",
    "far more than have been observed with current rv planet surveys  over a wide range of spectral types . with a mission of five years , gaia will be able to determine orbits for planets with periods of up to about 10 years . extrapolating from current known systems ( and only a limited part of the orbital parameter space has been explored ) ,",
    "it is expected that gaia will detect some 5000 new planetary systems ( compared to some 120 known as of mid 2004 ) and determine accurate orbital elements for 10002000 of them . from the above equation",
    ", we see that for a given size of orbit and mass of star , the minimum mass planet which gaia can detect decreases linearly with distance . for the nearest stars ",
    "closer than 10pc  gaia will be able to detect planets with 3% of the mass of juipter , or 10 earth masses .",
    "this extensive exoplanetary survey will provide detailed statistics on the types of planetary systems which stars of different mass , metallicity , and age do and do not host .",
    "this will mark a major contribution to understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems .",
    "gaia should also be able to detect some planets when they transit across their host stars and thus cause a dimming of the integrated light received by gaia .",
    "of course this only occurs for near edge - on orbits ( i.e.  @xmath14 ) . as jupiter has a diameter about ten times smaller than the sun , its transit would cause the sun to dim by 1% . to detect this with a signal - to - noise of 10 in the g band requires a photometric precision of 1 millimag , easily achieved in single epoch photometry for stars brighter than about g=1314 . despite the relatively poor time sampling for transits",
    ", gaia observes millions of such stars .",
    "predictions have been made that of order 6000 planets around f  k type stars with semi - major axes in the range 02au will be detected this way . incidentally , and in keeping with the theme of this conference , a transit of venus across the sun ( radius ratio of 1/115 ) observed from a large distance ( not from the earth ! ) causes a maximum dimming of 0.08 millimag .",
    "this is at the level at which gaia photometry will probably be dominated by systematic errors so is unlikely to be detectable even for the brightest stars .",
    "most star formation occurs in cold , dense , dark molecular clouds . as gas",
    "is converted into stars via gravitational collapse ( and quite possibly via the dissipation of supersonic turbulence ) , the cloud emerges from being an embedded cluster to an optically visible young star forming region or open cluster , such as the dense orion nebula cluster or the less dense low mass star forming region taurus ",
    "auriga ( with ages of a few million years ) .",
    "such clusters evolve dynamically : internal encounters will slowly evaporate the lower mass members and interactions with the galactic tidal field and passing interstellar clouds will disrupt all but the densest clusters .",
    "surveys of stellar clusters show a mark drop off in numbers beyond a few hundred million years in age .",
    "thus is appears that almost all clusters will disperse into the galactic field population over a timescale somewhat less than 1gyr .    by studying the structure and content of clusters  in particular the initial mass function and binarity  at different ages and abundances we therefore study the recent star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "gaia will make some of its most fundamental contributions in this area .",
    "first , by measuring very accurate distances for individual stars in clusters , it will allow an accurate determination of stellar luminosities across a wide range of evolutionary phases , thus making vital tests of theories of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "for the nearest clusters , such as the hyades , gaia will determine the imf ( corrected for binarity ) down into the brown dwarf regime and down to a solar mass for cluster as far away as 3kpc .",
    "by accurately determining the distances to subgiants , the position of the main sequence turn off can be determined to much higher accuracy than is presently possible , resulting in a significant improvement in age determinations through isochrone fitting .",
    "of the 1000 clusters currently known ( mostly within 2kpc ) , distances are only known to about half of them , of which many are still highly uncertain , by factors of two or more . according to webda",
    "there are some 70 clusters within 500pc , of which 20 are closer than 200pc .",
    "for all of these , gaia will determine distances to _ individual _ members brighter than v=15 to better than 0.5% .",
    "this corresponds to a depth accuracy of 2.5pc at 500pc or better for nearer cluster and/or brighter stars .",
    "these data will provide a three dimensional map of clusters and their mass distribution . combined with accurate three dimensional velocities from the radial velocities and proper motions",
    ", we will be able to study the dynamical evolution of clusters across a range of characteristics in much more detail than has previously been possible .",
    "recalling that gaia s distance accuracy , @xmath15 , depends on distance , @xmath11 , as @xmath16 for a star of given apparent magnitude , then at a distance of 100pc the depth uncertainty is only 0.1% or 0.1pc . for a given type of star , i.e.  of given intrinsic luminosity , @xmath17 . thus out to 200pc",
    ", gaia will measure the distances to all giants and all dwarfs earlier than about k5m0v to better than 1 part in 250 . in terms of kinematics",
    ", all these stars will have their tangential velocities determined to better than 1 .",
    "extending the range to 500pc , then giant star kinematics are still measured with this precision or better , as are dwarfs earlier than mid a types .",
    "armed with this information we can investigate mass segregation , ejection and the the dispersion of clusters .",
    "the power of gaia comes in the vast number of stars it observes over the whole sky with a well - defined selection function . by searching for clusterings in the multidimensional space formed by the 3d spatial co - ordinates , the 3d velocity co - ordinates , as well as `` astrophysical co - ordinates '' ( ,  etc .",
    "obtained from gaia photometry ) we can use the gaia archive to detect new clusters , associations and moving groups out to several kpc .",
    "this will provide a much more complete , systematic and reliable survey for stellar clusters than has hitherto been possible .",
    "gaia s combination of 6d phase space information and astrophysical parameter determination make it a unique instrument for determining the large scale structure of our galaxy .",
    "it is here that its faint limiting magnitude , all - sky coverage and determination of stellar properties ( especially metallicity ) are particularly important .",
    "we can , for example , investigate the age  metallicity relation ( using long - lived k and m dwarfs ) with a much larger sample than has been possible to date .",
    "a dynamical determination of the mass of the disk and its dark matter content will likewise be possible , as is a determination of the galactic rotation curves out to large galactocentric distances .    within the galactic disk",
    ", gaia will provide an accurate mapping of star forming regions and spiral arms .",
    "interstellar extinction will ultimately limit how far gaia can see in the galactic plane , but by identifying and measuring parallaxes of very luminous cepheid variables , for instance , we can map out structure to large distances .",
    "moving to the halo , the gaia database will allow us to search for stellar clusterings in the galactic halo which may be hallmarks of merger events .",
    "in addition to the spatial overdensity searches generally carried out with existing star - count data sets , we can apply multidimensional cluster search algorithms to look for intrinsic patterns in a space  velocity  astrophysical parameter space .",
    "this would be relevant for finding halo streams which may not be spatially distinct but nonetheless share a common orbit and/or star formation epoch . even at 10kpc , gaia can determine tangential velocities to 0.5  for stars as faint as g=15 ( i.e.  with absolute magnitudes less than zero , such as ob main - sequence stars and k giants ) . in the outer halo ( @xmath18kpc from the galactic centre ) , most stars will have relatively uncertain parallaxes ( parallax errors of greater than 20% for g@xmath1915 ) . however",
    ", photometric ` parallaxes ' may then provide a reasonable distance estimate from which proper motions may still be converted to tangential velocities of useful precision .",
    "moreover , as intervening foreground objects will have much larger ( and accurate ) parallaxes , these foreground ` contaminants ' can be distinguished from the background tracers giants which may then be used as kinematic and density tracers in the halo .      beyond our galaxy , the parallaxes of individual objects will be negligible . by averaging over a population",
    ", useful results may be obtained .",
    "for example , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) has a parallax of about 20 .",
    "but by averaging over a suitable set of members , a geometric distance to the lmc with an accuracy of about 1% should be obtainable .    in studying local group galaxies ,",
    "gaia proper motions will permit a better distinction between stars in our galaxy and those in external galaxies . with a reliable selection , mean distances and motions of local group galaxies can be determined . by determining 3d orbits within the local group out to 12mpc ( which includes some 20 galaxies ) , it may be possible to probe fluctuations in the initial density distribution of matter on cosmological scales .    an important aspect of gaia is its direct optical observations of quasars . from these , gaia astrometry will be tied to a quasi - inertial reference frame with an accuracy of better than 1yr@xmath20 . down to its limiting magnitude of g=20",
    ", it is predicted that gaia will detect around half a million quasars .",
    "these will be observed in all of gaia s 15 photometric bands at some 100 epochs from which the classes of quasars and their variability may be studied .",
    "interestingly , gaia will be sensitive to the motion of the solar system barycentre about the galactic centre .",
    "this motion induces an aberration in the position of distant objects such as quasars . with the sun moving at 220  at a distance of 8.5kpc about the galactic centre with a period of 250myr",
    ", quasars will show an apparent proper motion of about 4yr@xmath20 .",
    "gaia performs real - time onboard detection of everything with a point source magnitude brighter than g=20 .",
    "thus transient events , in particular supernovae , will be detectable . based on the current known supernovae rate",
    ", gaia will catch about 50 supernovae _ per day_.",
    "a real - time classification and alerts system is envisaged for such events , from which rapid follow up by other observatories will be possible .    finally , because gaia will measure distances accurately to very large numbers of different types of stars , including rr lyraes and cepheids , it will permit a much better calibration of primary distance indicators than has hitherto been possible .",
    "this will provide a geometrically calibrated distance scale which is independent of cmb or cosmological models .",
    "at the time of writing ( mid 2004 ) gaia is planned for launch in 2011 .",
    "present efforts focus on several essential technology developments on the industrial side , related , for example , to the ccds , sic mirrors and feep thrusters . on the scientific side ,",
    "the major on - going effort is preparation for the data analysis .",
    "gaia will produce data at a rate of about 1 mb / s for 5 years , producing a total of some 100 tb raw data .",
    "this quantity of data is not actually that large . the challenging issue with the gaia data processing it the complexity of the data . due to the continuous scanning of the satellite over a period of five years , the astrometric data stream essentially consists of a strip of data focal plane data 2.6 million degrees in length .",
    "each object typically appears 100 times in this data strip .",
    "thus the data reduction involves object matching in the 7000 or so different quasi - great circle scans making up this strip .",
    "the relative one - dimensional positions of a few hundred million stars must then be determined from which the five basic astrometric co - ordinates of each of these stars are solved for in the so - called _ global iterative solution _ ( gis ) .",
    "this process must simultaneously solve for the attitude of the satellite and the various instrument calibration parameters .",
    "numerous additional astrometric reduction tasks much be included , such as solving for higher order astrometric terms of binary star systems .",
    "furthermore , the radial velocity data and photometric data must also be included , often simultaneously .",
    "for example , the colour of the star must be included in the astrometric reduction , as must be the radial velocity for nearby , high proper motion stars ( as their parallaxes and proper motions will not be constant with time ) .",
    "the data analysis with gaia is therefore a major challenge .",
    "a data reduction prototype , gdaas , has been running for a few years which is studying these problems . beyond this",
    ", efforts are also ongoing to ensure that the resulting gaia database can be properly exploited for subsequent scientific work .",
    "these include experiments in data mining and work on theoretical models against which galactic structure and kinematic data may be compared .",
    "gaia is a project of the european space agency ( esa ) with guidance from the scientific community organised into several working groups under the auspices of the gaia science team ( gst ) .",
    "it is through the efforts of these people , esa staff and our industrial partners that gaia has reached its present advanced stage of development .",
    "much of this article has drawn from the gaia concept and technology study report ( esa 2000 ) , complied by the former gaia science advisory group , from which more detailed information and references can be obtained ."
