    "from the earliest observations of x - ray binaries in globular clusters ( gcs ) it has been noted that they must be very efficient sites for the production of compact binary systems @xcite .",
    "the key to the overabundance of compact binaries in clusters , as compared to the field , is close stellar encounters .",
    "the processes that influence the binary population in dense stellar environments include the destruction of wide binaries ( `` ionization '' ) , hardening of close binaries , physical collisions , and exchange interactions , through which low - mass companions tend to be replaced by more massive participants in the encounter . as a result of these processes , in the dense cores of globular clusters ,",
    "binaries are strongly depleted and their period distribution is very different from that of a field population @xcite .",
    "this effect is stronger for binaries including a compact object , like cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "the issue of the dynamical formation of cvs has been extensively discussed .",
    "considering the cv formation via tidal captures , @xcite showed that dynamical formation of cvs is not expected because more massive donors lead to unstable mass transfer . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite predicted the existence of many cvs formed via tidal captures , as many as an order of magnitude more than would be predicted by standard binary evolution , making cvs a probe of the dynamical processes in the cluster .",
    "detection of cvs in globular clusters proved difficult ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a population was detected using the _ hubble space telescope _",

    "counterparts to _ chandra _ x - ray sources in several gcs .",
    "valuable information was obtained for populations of cvs , chromospherically active binaries and quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries ( qlmxbs ) @xcite .",
    "for the first time we can compare populations of such binaries in globular clusters ( gcs ) and in the galactic field , and infer their rates of formation and population characteristics . in particular , 22 cvs have now been identified in 47 tuc , allowing identification of several differences between typical cvs in globular clusters and cvs in the galactic field .",
    "these differences include relatively high x - ray luminosities compared to field systems @xcite ; a lack of novae , and of the steady , bright blue accretion discs signifying novalike cvs , in gcs @xcite ; relatively low frequencies of dwarf nova outbursts ( dnos ) , the typical identifiers of cvs in the galactic disc @xcite ; and a higher ratio of x - ray to optical flux than in most field cvs @xcite .",
    "these differences produce puzzles : the lack of novae , novalikes , and dno suggests very low mass transfer rates , while the high x - ray luminosities indicate moderate mass transfer rates .",
    "the x - ray to optical flux ratio suggests the cvs are dne , but the lack of dno argues against this .",
    "it was suggested that cv discs in gcs are more stable due to a combination of low mass transfer rates and moderately strong white dwarf magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "this hints that the evolutionary paths of cvs in gcs and in the field are different .",
    "comparisons of the numbers of cvs in clusters of different central densities also supports the idea that cvs are produced through dynamical interactions @xcite , though there is an indication that cv production may depend more weakly on density than the production of low - mass x - ray binaries containing neutron stars @xcite .",
    "this is the first of two papers where we summarize results of our studies on compact binary formation in gcs , some preliminary results of which were reported in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the formation of compact binaries with a white dwarf , and in the second paper ( paper ii ) we will describe dynamical formation and evolution of binaries with a ns companion .",
    "we explore a large spectrum of globular cluster models , where for the first time we take into account ( i ) the mechanism of binary formation through physical collisions using results from smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) and ( ii ) the effect of metallicity on the formation and subsequent evolution of close binaries . in section",
    "2 we provide a complete review of the physical processes of formation and destruction of mass - transferring wd binaries .",
    "in section  3 we outline the methods and assumptions . the major formation channels , and population characteristics for cvs and am  cvn systems ( double wd systems where one wd experiences roche lobe overflow ) in different clusters are presented and discussed in section  4 .",
    "we conclude in the last section by addressing the connection between our results and the observations .",
    "there are several ways to destroy a primordial binary in a globular cluster .",
    "for instance , in a dense region a soft binary will very likely be `` ionized '' ( destroyed ) as a result of a dynamical encounter . a hard binary , in contrast ,",
    "can be destroyed through a physical collision during the encounter .",
    "the probability of such an outcome increases strongly as the binary becomes harder @xcite .",
    "in addition to dynamical processes , a primordial binary can be destroyed through an evolutionary merger or following a sn explosion .",
    "overall , even if a cluster initially had 100% of its stars in binaries initially , the binary fraction at an age of 10 - 14 gyr will typically be as low as @xmath0 @xcite .    to understand the evolution of a primordial binary in a dense environment and the probability of a binary becoming a cv , two steps are required : ( i ) compare the evolutionary time - scales with the time - scale of dynamical encounters ; ( ii ) analyze what is the consequence of an encounter ( this depends strongly on the hardness of the binary ) .",

    "these binaries are expected to evolve in the same way in a gc as in the field .",
    "a binary consisting of a ms star and a wd can be formed via several kinds of dynamical encounters : via an exchange interaction , via a tidal capture ( tc ) of a ms by a wd , or via physical collisions between a red giant ( rg ) and a ms star .",

    "this is consistent with the results of sph simulations for physical collisions of a rg and a ms star ( j.  lombardi 2005 , priv .",
    "communication ) .    in fig .",
    "[ mswd - formation ] we also show possible binary periods for binaries formed via physical collisions with a red giant .",
    "note that it is hard to form a relatively close ms - wd binary ( one that is able to start mt within a few gyr ) with a wd more massive than 0.3 @xmath15 via either prescription .",
    "also , in binaries with the mass ratio @xmath61 , roche lobe overflow leads to delayed dynamical instability and a binary merger .",
    "this limits the ms star mass to @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the cv progenitors from the channel of physical collisions of rgs and ms stars are expected to initially have rather low mass wd accretors , and donor star masses @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , metallicity variations should not affect this channel strongly . the evolutionary stage during he core burning lasts almost the same time as the rg branch , however , he core stars of @xmath63 are a few times more compact than at the end of the rg branch and have a larger core than during rg evolution . therefore a collision between a he",
    "core burning star and a ms star also favors the formation of a wd - ms binary that is close enough to become a cv .",
    "this channel mainly provides binaries with a wd mass at the start of accretion of about 0.5 @xmath15 ( just a bit above the core mass at the time of he core flash ) .    on the other hand , there are not many single wds of such small masses present in a gc core . a wd with mass @xmath64 can not ( yet ) be formed in single star evolution ",
    "it must evolve via a ce event or a physical collision .",
    "a binary containing such a wd is very hard and has @xmath65  gyr . if an encounter occurs , it is more likely to result in a merger rather than an exchange .",
    "we therefore expect that most cvs with a low mass wd companion will be formed either through a ce event ( in a primordial binary or in a dynamically formed binary with @xmath66 days ) , or as a result of a physical collision , but not via direct exchange encounter .    a typical binary formed via an exchange encounter has @xmath67 .",
    "in order to become a cv within 2 gyr ( or before the next encounter ) , it should have a post - encounter period of a few days ( see also fig .  [ mswd - ecc ] ) . according to energy conservation during an exchange encounter @xcite , and assuming that during an exchange encounter the less massive companion is replaced by the more massive intruding star , the post - encounter binary separation will be larger than pre - encounter .",
    "the domain of pre - encounter binaries that will be able to form a cv - progenitor binary via only exchange encounter is therefore limited to very short period binaries ( with correspondingly long collision times ) , and these binaries are very likely to experience a physical collision rather than an exchange @xcite .",

    "there are two kinds of post - formation dynamical effects that can happen during fly - by encounters : ( i ) binary hardening ; ( ii ) eccentricity pumping .",
    "even if each hardening encounter could reduce the orbital separation by as much as @xmath68 , the hardening of this binary from 10 days to 1 day ( at this period mb starts to be efficient ) will take about 20 gyr . in the case of eccentricity",
    "pumping ( assuming no binary energy change ) , the mean time between successive collisions stays at @xmath69  gyr and therefore a binary can experience many encounters .",
    "if the acquired eccentricity @xmath70 , the binary can shrink through gw emission even if its initial period is larger than 10 days .",
    "the last possibility for such a wide dynamically formed binary to become a cv is a ce event that happens in a post - exchange ms - ms binary .      .",
    "@xmath34 is the post - encounter orbital period and @xmath71 is the mass of the wd secondary .",
    "the dashed lines show the binary periods for constant collision times and the dotted lines delineate the binaries that will begin mt within 2 gyr due to gw emission for different post - encounter eccentricities .",
    "the solid lines show binaries of different eccentricities that can be formed through a collision between a wd of 0.6 @xmath15 and a rg of 0.8 @xmath15 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "[ wdwd ] ]    for the evolution of wd - wd binaries , we adopt that only gw are important as a mechanism of angular momentum loss and neglect the possibility of tidal heating .",
    "the maximum possible periods for different post - encounter eccentricities are shown on fig.[wdwd ] .",
    "let us first examine a wd - wd binary formation via direct exchange .",
    "again , as in the case of ms - wd binaries , a typical eccentricity is @xmath73 and the separation is comparable to the pre - exchange separation .",
    "the collision time for both pre - encounter and post - exchange binaries is so long that both binary hardening and exchanges are very rare events .",
    "the main difference with ms - wd binaries is that post - exchange wd - wd binary periods that will allow a binary to evolve to mass transfer ( mt ) are several times smaller for the same eccentricities .",
    "therefore , the exchange channel producing a post - exchange binary consisting of two wds seems to be very unlikely .",
    "a more important channel seems to be the case of an exchange encounter that leads to the formation of a ms - wd binary .",
    "if the ms star is massive enough to become a rg during the cluster lifetime , such a binary can evolve through ce and form a close wd - wd binary .",
    "the second important channel is again a physical collision , involving a single wd with a rg ( see fig",
    ".  [ wdwd ] , where we show possible outcomes of a such a collision ) .",
    "we note that both treatments ( parameterized sph results and ce prescription ) lead to the formation of wd - wd binaries that are roughly equally likely to start the mt .",
    "we therefore expect that only a post - ce system can become an am  cvn , where the post - ce system could be from a primordial binary , a post - collision binary , or a dynamically formed binary .",
    "for our numerical simulations of globular clusters we use a monte carlo approach described in detail in @xcite .",

    "we keep a complete record of all events that happen to any cluster star , dynamical ( like collisions , tidal captures and exchanges , as well as changes of the binary eccentricity or the binary separation after a fly - by encounter ) , or evolutionary ( like common envelope events , mass transfers , or sn explosions ) .",
    "this helps to analyze the final populations and understand what factors played the most significant role in their formation .",
    "the `` standard '' cluster model in our simulations has initially @xmath75 stars and initial binary fraction of 100% .",
    "the distribution of initial binary periods is constant in the logarithm between contact and @xmath76  d and the eccentricities are distributed thermally .",
    "we want to stress here that about 2/3 of these binaries are soft initially ( the binary fraction provided by only hard binaries gives an initial binary fraction of about @xmath77 if the 1-d velocity dispersion is 10 km / s ) and most very tight binaries are destroyed through evolutionary mergers .",
    "our initial binary fraction is therefore comparable to the initial binary fractions that are usually used in @xmath74-body codes , where it is assumed for simplicity that very soft binaries will not live long as binaries and will only slow down the simulations . for more detailed discussion on the choice of the primordial binary fraction , see @xcite .    for single stars and primaries we adopted the broken power law initial mass function ( imf ) of @xcite and a flat mass - ratio distribution for secondaries .",

    "the enhanced production rate of double wd mergers in dense stellar clusters was first discussed in detail by @xcite , who applied this to open clusters .",
    "they found that the supra - chandrasekhar wd merger rate can be increased by an order of magnitude ( although their statistics were based on only a few events ) .",
    "we did not find such an increase compared to the field population , where star formation is continuing , though we found some increase compared to the case without dynamical interactions ( see table  [ tab - channels - expl ] ) .",
    "however , we note that our total number of supra - chandrasekhar wd mergers is large .",
    "in fact , if indeed all those mergers lead to formation of nss , and those nss are retained by the cluster , then this channel provides about 6% of all nss ever created .",

    "in addition , the production of nss via aic is comparable to the production of nss via merger induced collapse , and therefore also appears to be a significant source of nss in gcs .",

    "we estimate the contribution of sn ia produced in gcs to total galactic sn rates . assuming that @xmath126 is contained in galactic gcs ( @xmath127 galactic gcs ) , we find that the single - degenerate channel from gcs can provide at best 1 sn per @xmath128 yr per galaxy , and the contribution of gcs is only several times higher if the double - degenerate channel ( supra - chandrasekhar ) also results in sn . in spiral galaxies",
    "the rate of sn ia is 0.04 - 0.1 per century per galaxy @xcite , and therefore the contribution of gcs is not important .",
    "however , gcs can play a larger role in elliptical galaxies , where no star formation is going on and the rate of sn ia provided by the field population is smaller .",
    "in addition , in ellipticals the specific frequency of gcs per galaxy luminosity unit is significantly higher than in spirals ( up to 8.6 compared to 0.5 in milky way , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "also , it has been shown that the observational sn ia rate consists of two components  a prompt piece that is proportional to the star formation rate , and an extended piece that is proportional to the total stellar mass @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior of the formation rates of both single degenerate and double degenerate channels in gcs , which peak during the first gyr of the cluster evolution and have a flat distribution at later times .",

    "[ sec - amcv ] , as well as most double white dwarf mergers discussed in  [ sec - expl ] ( with the exclusion of a small fraction of mergers that are results of physical collision during hard binary encounters ) are coalescing binaries driven by gravitational radiation . prior to their mergers , or before and during the mt",
    ", they can be detectable as gravitational wave sources by lisa .",
    "their detectability is significantly enhanced when their orbital periods become smaller than about @xmath129s @xcite , so their signals can be distinguished from the background noise produced by galactic binaries .",
    "as the positional accuracy of lisa will be much greater for binaries with such short periods , these sources can be associated with specific globular clusters in our galaxy .    from our simulations",
    "we find that at any given moment , a typical cluster of 200,000 @xmath15 will contain 10 lisa sources on average , and at least 3 lisa binaries at any given moment ; during 1 gyr a cluster forms 180 lisa systems .",
    "a massive cluster like 47 tuc , with mass @xmath130 , will have at least 10 lisa sources at any given moment , and 40 lisa binaries on average . at an age of 10 gyrs",
    "such a cluster can produce as many as 3 - 15 ns - wd lisa binaries per gyr ( a typical cluster produces 1 - 3 ns - wd coalescing binaries per gyr ) .    with the total mass in gcs of about @xmath131 ,",
    "as many as 1500 lisa binaries can be present in all galactic gcs ( this number will decrease if the ce efficiency is smaller ) .",
    "the most optimistic upper limit for the galactic formation rate of ns - wd binaries in gcs is several hundred per gyr .",
    "the lifetime of a ns - wd binary in the lisa - band during the mt is @xmath132 yr . the time prior to the onset of mt depends on the binary eccentricity , but is usually much shorter @xcite . with our predicted formation rates , as many as 10 - 50 ns - wd lisa binaries can be detected in gcs .",
    "this number is probably too optimistic , as fewer than 10 ultra - compact x - ray binaries ( mass - transferring ns - wd binaries with orbital periods less than an hour ) have been identified in gcs , implying that the formation rate of lisa - sources should be smaller .",
    "( one explanation could be that many globular clusters are less dense than our `` standard '' model and ns - wd formation is thus less frequent . )",
    "we shall address the issue of the formation rates of binaries with nss in more detail in paper ii . here",
    "we will only note that the lisa binaries will spend spend most of their time in the lisa band among their mt tracks , with chirp masses @xmath133 ( see fig .",
    "[ lisa - bin ] ) .",
    "with our simulations we predict that the formation rates of cvs and am  cvns in globular clusters are not very different from those in the field population .",
    "the numbers of cvs and am cvns per mass unit are comparable to numbers in the field if the whole cluster population is considered , and they are only 2 - 3 times larger in the core than in the field .",
    "dynamical formation is responsible only for 60%-70% of cvs in the core .",
    "this fraction decreases as the density decreases , and the role of primordial cvs becomes more important .",
    "we rule out tidal captures as an effective mechanism for cv formation in gcs unless the rate of tcs is significantly underestimated .",
    "instead we propose that the population of gc cvs reflects a combination of primordial cvs , cvs in post - exchange binaries , and products of physical collisions of ms stars with rgs .",
    "there are also primordial cvs which are located in the halo and have never entered the core .",
    "the gc core density variation indeed does not play a very large role , in contrast to the case of ns binaries , where almost all systems are formed dynamically @xcite and whose numbers have a strong dependence on the cluster collision rate @xcite .",
    "we expect to have one detectable cv per @xmath134 in the core of a typical cluster and about one detectable cv per @xmath135 in a 47 tuc type cluster .",
    "thus we predict 35 - 40 cvs in the core of 47 tuc , in quite reasonable agreement with observations , where 22 cvs in 47 tuc have been identified @xcite .",
    "even better agreement between our simulations and the observed number of cvs can be obtained if we assume that the initial core mass in 47 tuc is smaller than 5% of the cluster .",
    "although the formation rates do not differ strongly , we found significant differences in the populations , and note that these differences may have observational consequences .",
    "indeed , cataclysmic variables in globular clusters have an unusual array of characteristics , which make them difficult to classify as members of the standard classes of cvs recognized in the galaxy .",
    "their x - ray luminosities seem to be rather high , compared with cvs in the field @xcite .",
    "they exhibit dwarf nova outbursts only rarely , compared to well - studied dwarf novae : only 1 dwarf nova was found in 47 tuc by @xcite in a survey which would have detected 1/3 of known dwarf novae if they were located in 47 tuc , while @xcite identify 22 firm cvs in 47 tuc",
    ". finally , the x - ray to optical flux ratios of cvs in globular clusters are relatively high , comparable to those of dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "one solution to this problem was the suggestion that cvs in globular clusters tend to be primarily magnetic in nature , compared to cvs in the field @xcite .",
    "magnetic cvs have no discs ( am her or polar cvs ) , or truncated discs ( dq her cvs or intermediate polars , ips ) , because of the effect of the wd magnetic field . as a result , the disc instability is nonexistent or suppressed .",
    "magnetic cvs are believed to produce x - rays through an accretion shock above the polar cap , producing high x - ray luminosities , while nonmagnetic cvs produce an optically thick boundary layer , saturating their x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "strong he ii @xmath58 4686  lines were observed in the spectra of three cvs in ngc 6397 @xcite , indicating a strong source of fuv radiation .",
    "this fuv radiation could indicate either evidence for an intermediate polar interpretation , or a very high mass transfer rate ; the second interpretation is favored for the fuv - bright , 27-hour period cv ako9 in 47 tuc @xcite .",
    "another argument in favor of the intermediate polar interpretation is the excess @xmath136 ( in addition to that expected along the line of sight ) observed towards many cvs in 47 tuc @xcite .",
    "excess @xmath136 in cvs that are not observed at high inclinations has been considered a signature of the accretion curtains observed in the magnetic systems known as intermediate polars .",
    "however , only two globular cluster cvs have shown clear evidence of magnetic fields in their x - ray lightcurves so far ( x9 and x10 in 47 tuc * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may not mean that these systems are not magnetic , since the number of x - ray photons detected from globular clusters is generally small ( compared with nearby , well - studied cvs ) . in addition , it has been suggested that the accretion in sw sex and vy scl cvs is governed by the wd magnetic field , without evidence of pulsations @xcite .",
    "another problem for the magnetic interpretation is that ips tend to be optically brighter than typical cvs in globular clusters , which have lower ratios of x - ray to optical flux more typical of dwarf novae than ips @xcite .",
    "a final problem is the observation of dwarf nova outbursts in two of the three cvs in ngc 6397 possessing strong he ii emission @xcite .",
    "a proposed resolution to these problems is a combination of a low mass transfer rate ( which will reduce the optical brightness and increase the x - ray to optical flux ratio ) with an intermediate polar nature @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the dwarf nova recurrence times for cv discs with various mass transfer rates and wd magnetic moments , and found a parameter space that fulfilled the requirements of globular cluster cvs .",
    "left unanswered was why globular cluster cvs might tend to have stronger magnetic fields than field systems .",
    "our work provides a possible answer to this question .",
    "globular cluster dynamics has a strong effect on the composition of the binaries that form cvs , tending to place more massive wds into binaries that will become cvs ( fig .",
    "11 ) . increasing",
    "the mass of wds in cvs increases the energy that can be extracted at a given mass transfer rate , thus increasing the x - ray luminosity and x - ray to optical flux ratio of the cvs .",
    "this effect is complementary to the effects of higher magnetic fields .",
    "however , higher mass wds also have a higher probability of showing strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "thus the dynamical origin of wds in globular cluster cvs may be responsible for the observational peculiarities of globular cluster cvs ; their relatively high x - ray luminosities and x - ray to optical flux ratios , and their low rates of dwarf nova outbursts .",
    "the tendency for higher mass white dwarf accretors in gc cvs in comparison to the field also affects the production of the superhump phenomenon .",
    "this behavior results from the precession of the outer disc due to the excitation of resonances within the disc caused by the 3:1 commensurability of motions in the disc with the companion s orbital period ( see * ? ? ?",
    "such systems are characterized by mass ratios ( of donor to accretor ) of less than 0.25 - 0.33 .",
    "systems of this type in the field are rarely observed at orbital periods above the period gap , but the higher white dwarf masses of cvs in gcs would increase their likelihood in gcs .",
    "we examined also several other consequences of having a dynamically modified population of close binaries including wds .",
    "in particular , considering supra - chandrasekhar mergers , we found that too many nss may be formed if these mergers lead to merger - induced collapse .",
    "we suggest that either this mechanism does not lead to ns formation , or the ce efficiency is overestimated . by our estimates , gcs do not contribute strongly to the sn ia rates in spiral galaxies , however they may significantly increase these rates in elliptical galaxies . we have also shown that gcs can be excellent sites for lisa observations since many gcs will contain several lisa sources at any given moment , although most of those systems will have low chirp masses .",
