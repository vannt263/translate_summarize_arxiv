    "since 2008 , 3c 279 is being continuously monitored by _",

    "this source is an active @xmath0-ray emitter and multiple episodes of @xmath0-ray outbursts have been detected @xcite . in particular ,",
    "two prominent flares of similar intensity ( @xmath8 ; where @xmath9 is in 0.1@xmath1300 gev range and in units of 10@xmath4 ) have been detected by lat in 2013 december and 2014 april .",
    "interestingly , the 2013 december flare exhibited a hard rising spectrum , whereas a significant curvature was noticed in 2014 april flare @xcite .",

    "to analyze the lat data ( p7rep ) covering the period of @xmath0-ray outburst , the standard data reduction procedure is adopted and here it is described in brief .",
    "the unbinned likelihood method included in the pylikelihood library of science tools ( v9r33p0 ) is used to extract the information from the events belonging to the source class and energy range 0.1@xmath1300 gev and lying within 10@xmath15 region of interest ( roi ) centered at the position of 3c 279 . a maximum likelihood ( ml ) test statistic ts=2@xmath16log(@xmath17 ) , where @xmath17 represents the likelihood function between models with and without a point source at the position of source of interest , is calculated to determine the significance of the @xmath0-ray signal .",
    "all the sources lying within the roi and defined in the third _ fermi_-lat catalog ( 3fgl ; * ? ? ?",

    "sources lying within 10@xmath15 to 15@xmath15 from the center of the roi are also appeared in the model file and their parameters are kept fixed to the 3fgl catalog values .",
    "a first run of the ml analysis is performed over the period of interest and all the sources with ts@xmath1825 are removed from further analysis .    to characterize the variability properties of the source ,",
    "light curves are generated using various time binnings ( 3 hr , 6 hr , 12 hr , and 1 day ) and over different energy intervals ( 0.1@xmath1300 gev , 0.1@xmath11 gev , and 1@xmath1300 gev ) .",
    "though the @xmath0-ray spectral shape of 3c 279 exhibit a definite curvature , all the light curves are produced by adopting a simple power law ( pl ) in each time bin , since the statistical uncertainties on the pl indices are smaller compared to those obtained from complex model fits such as broken power law ( bpl ) .",
    "various models are applied to fit the @xmath0-ray spectra of 3c 279 and that includes a bpl ( @xmath19 with @xmath20 if @xmath21 and @xmath22 if @xmath23 ) , a log - parabola ( @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the photon index at @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the curvature index and @xmath26 is fixed at 300 mev ) , and a pl model over logarithmically equally spaced energy bins with @xmath28 kept fixed to the value fitted over the whole energy range .    all the time / energy bins with @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the error estimate in the flux @xmath31 , and/or ts@xmath1893@xmath32 detection @xcite . ]",
    "are rejected from the analysis .",
    "systematics on the measured fluxes are of around 10% below 100 mev , 5% between 316 mev to 10 gev and 10% above 10 gev .",

    "the daily binned light curve of 3c 279 at photon energies 0.1@xmath1300 gev , covering the period of high activity is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : fermi_lc ] .",
    "the source started showing activity around mjd 57,184 with flux level about @xmath331 and after a period of 3 days , @xmath0-ray flux increased by a factor of 10 where it remain steady for 2 days .",
    "the source displayed another flare of higher amplitude on mjd 57,189 when the highest @xmath0-ray flux obtained as @xmath9 = 24.5@xmath20.5 , which is the highest daily binned @xmath0-ray flux measurement from 3c 279 since the launch of _",
    "the associated photon index is hard and having a value of 2.05@xmath20.02 . immediately after this flaring activity",
    ", the source returned to a relatively low activity state where flux remained at the level of @xmath331 .",
    "based on the observed activity in the daily binned light curve , the entire period is then divided into four states : a pre@xmath1flare , two flares , and a post@xmath1flare state .",
    "these periods are shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : fermi_lc ] and labeled as pre , p1 , p2 , and post , respectively .    due to good photon statistics",
    ", the light curves are also generated using time bins of 12 hr , 6 hr , and 3 hr and are shown in the bottom three panels of figure  [ fig : fermi_lc ] . as can be seen , the flare of period p1 starts getting resolved in finer bin light curves .",
    "in fact , this period comprises of two flares distinctly visible in 6 hr binned light curve .",
    "there is a third sharp flare as p1 ends and p2 begins .",
    "these three flares are named as f1 , f2 , and f3 for the rest of the analysis ( see figure  [ fig : fermi_lc ] ) .",
    "the rising phase of the brightest flare f3 is clearly unresolved down to 3 hr scale whereas its decaying segment seems to be nicely resolved in 6 hr binning .",
    "though the flares f1 and f2 appear to be resolved in 6 hr binning , the 3 hr binning light curve suggests for the presence of sub - structures consisting of several large amplitude yet unresolved and exhibiting chaotic events .",
    "the highest @xmath0-ray flux , using 3 hr binning , is obtained as @xmath9 = 33.5@xmath21.4 .",
    "moreover , the data is also analyzed using the time bins defined as good time intervals .",
    "the highest @xmath0-ray flux measured using this method is @xmath9 = 39.1@xmath22.5 , thereby making this peculiar @xmath0-ray flare as the brightest event recorded from 3c 279 not only since the beginning of _ fermi _ operation but also ever . for a comparison ,",
    "the historically brightest flare was detected by _",
    "egret _ when the measured flux was as high as @xmath342 @xmath3 10@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "further , the associated gti bin size is @xmath514 min with ts = 2407 and 275 counts are registered .    to determine the duration of the shortest flux variability ,",
    "the light curves are scanned using the following equation @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the fluxes at time @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , and @xmath41 is the flux doubling / halving timescale . the shortest flux doubling time using this method is measured as 2.2@xmath20.3 hr on mjd 57,189 with @xmath59@xmath32 significance .",
    "moreover , in order to assess the asymmetry of rise and decay of flares , all the three flares ( f1 , f2 , and f3 ) are also subjected to temporal profile fitting .",
    "this is done for 6 hr binned flares and the fitting is performed by including a constant background and three fast temporally evolving components .",
    "each flare is approximated to be fit by a function of the following form @xmath42^{-1}\\ ] ] @xcite , where @xmath43 is the flux at time @xmath44 representing approximately the flare amplitude , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the rise and decay time of the flare .",
    "the obtained rising time for f1 , f2 , and f3 are 5.40@xmath20.84 hr , 4.05@xmath22.73 hrs , and 3.06@xmath20.57 hr respectively , whereas the associated decay time of the flares are 9.91@xmath25.04 hr , 4.13@xmath22.02 hr , and 8.68@xmath20.42 hr respectively .",
    "the result of the time profile fitting is shown in figure  [ fig : flare_fitting ] .",
    "lat @xmath0-ray light curves of 3c 279 , focusing on the flare period , in two different energy bands : 0.1@xmath11 gev and 1@xmath1300 gev are shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : hr ] .",
    "the 1@xmath1300 gev light curve is scaled appropriately to compare its variability pattern with that seen in 0.1@xmath11 gev range . as can be seen ,",
    "though the pattern of flux variations are similar in both the bands during f3 flare , there are very moderate change in source brightness in 1@xmath1300 gev band compared to 0.1@xmath11 gev for f1 and f2 events .",
    "this observation indicates that the flare f1 and f2 are primarily caused by low energy electrons .",
    "further , the hardness ratio is also calculated to assess the spectral evolution as a function of time .",
    "this is done using following equation @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are 6 hr binned @xmath0-ray fluxes in 0.1@xmath11 gev and 1@xmath1300 gev energy ranges , respectively .",
    "though there are no significant spectral hardening / softening during f1 and f2 flares , the spectrum is clearly hard at the peak of f3 and it softens as the flare decays ( see middle panel of figure  [ fig : hr ] ) .",
    "further , recently it has been proposed that the origin of @xmath0-ray flares to be lying inside / outside the blr is reflected from the absence / presence of time lag between mev and gev emission @xcite . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "a time lag analysis is performed using the _ z - transformed discrete correlation function _ ( zdcf ) method of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the errors are computed using a monte carlo simulation by adding a random error at each step to each data from the errors in the light curves @xcite .",
    "the result of this analysis is shown in bottom panel of figure  [ fig : hr ] .",
    "as can be seen , there is no significant lead / lag noticed between two energy bands ( time lag of 0.0@xmath50 days ) .",
    "it should be noted that there could be lag between these light curves , however , limited time resolution of the light curves and closeness of the lat energy bands makes it difficult to quantify .",
    "the hints for the presence of spectral evolution can be further investigated by plotting photon index versus flux .",
    "this is done for 6 hr binned data , in two energy ranges : 0.1@xmath1300 gev and 0.1@xmath11 gev , for the period p1 and p2 ( covering the flares f1 , f2 , and f3 ) .",
    "the results are presented in the left panel of figure  [ fig : gamma_spec ] . for comparison ,",
    "the averages obtained over the period ` pre ' , is also shown with blue squares .",
    "a clockwise pattern is evident during p2 period for both energy bands .",
    "though there are hints for the same behavior during p1 period in 0.1@xmath1300 gev energy range , the 0.1@xmath11 gev plot show a clear evidence of clockwise helical pattern .",
    "the reduced @xmath51 for a constant fit of the photon index for the period p1 are 6.94/7 and 6.68/7 , for 0.1@xmath1300 gev and 0.1@xmath11 gev respectively . comparing to ` pre ' period ,",
    "a flux enhancement by a factor of 10 is accompanied by slight hardening of the spectrum .",
    "while drawing any firm conclusion on particle acceleration and cooling from these patterns is not possible , the lack of strong spectral variability still provides clues to the underlying radiative processes . due to poor statistics ,",
    "a clear pattern of the photon index for energy range 1@xmath1300 gev versus flux could not be observed with 6 hr time binning .    in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : gamma_spec ] , the lat spectra obtained by averaging the four periods shown in figure  [ fig : fermi_lc ] , are displayed .",
    "these flux distributions have been fitted with pl ( dotted ) , log - parabola ( dashed ) , and bpl ( solid ) models . due to low photon statistics during the periods ` pre ' and ` post ' , the bpl model could not be fitted . to substantiate the presence / absence of the spectral curvature , the ts of the curvature @xmath52 = 2(log @xmath17(log - parabola / bpl ) @xmath1 log @xmath17(pl ) )",
    "is also computed @xcite .",
    "the associated parameters are provided in table  [ tab : gamma_spec ] . out of all the four periods",
    "considered , a statistical significant break / curvature is noticed only during p1 and p2 periods . both the log - parabola and bpl model reproduce the data satisfactorily , though the log - parabola model gives slightly better fit .",
    "the break energy obtained from the bpl model fitting remains constant irrespective of the fluctuations seen in the flux levels , during both the periods .",
    "this finding is inline with that observed during the @xmath0-ray outburst of 3c 454.3 in 2010 november @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray outburst of 3c 279 in 2015 june has broken the record of the highest @xmath0-ray flux ever measured from this blazar .",
    "the entire flaring episode is found to comprise of three flares with the last one having the largest amplitude .",
    "the rising part of the brightest flare is unresolved down to 3 hr binning and this hints that with the limited time resolution , the apparent profiles of the source flux variations may not reflect the exact temporal characteristics of the @xmath0-ray outburst .",
    "however , the decaying part of the flare is nicely resolved in 6 hr and 3 hr binned light curves .",
    "the shortest flux doubling timescale obtained in this work is @xmath52 hr which is similar to that obtained during 2013 december outburst of 3c 279 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , comparing to 2014 april outburst , though the flux level is significantly higher during 2015 june flare , the faster variability was measured during the former @xcite . however ,",
    "similar to 2013 december and 2014 april flares , the flares of 2015 june outburst are found to exhibit asymmetric variability patterns with fast rise and slow decay ( except for f2 ) , which can be explained by invoking the rapid injection of accelerated electrons , probably at shock front , and the decay can be attributed to the weakening of the shock .",
    "the minimum doppler factor @xmath53 can be estimated numerically from @xmath6 opacity arguments and by measuring the energy of the highest energy photon detected during the flare . assuming that the optical depth @xmath54(@xmath55 ) of a photon with energy @xmath56 to the @xmath6 interaction is @xmath54 = 1 , the minimum doppler factor can be calculated as follows ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath57^{1/6},\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the flux at energy @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite . in this calculation , the energy of the highest energy photon ( @xmath61 ) is used during the period when variability time @xmath62 and @xmath58 are measured .",
    "the highest energy photon of energy @xmath3452 gev is detected on mjd 57,189.62 at an angular separation of 0@xmath15.09 from the 3fgl position of 3c 279 , with 99.99% probability of being source photon ( see bold downward arrow in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : fermi_lc ] ) . almost at the same time",
    ", the _ swift _ x - ray telescope observation has revealed the energy flux in 0.3@xmath110 kev band as 3.5 @xmath3 10@xmath63  and the associated photon index is 1.4 @xcite .",
    "since the highest energy photon was detected during the fading part of f3 , the variability time can be taken as @xmath64 ln(2 ) @xmath65 hr .",
    "this gives @xmath66 14 .",
    "a rough estimation about the location of the emission region ( @xmath67 ) can be done by assuming it to have spherical geometry and bulk lorentz factor @xmath68 . then @xmath690.05 pc",
    "now , considering the accretion disk luminosity ( @xmath70 ) of 3c 279 as 1 @xmath3 10@xmath71 ergs@xmath12  @xcite , the size of the blr comes out to be @xmath341 @xmath3",
    "10@xmath72 cm @xmath340.03 pc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , at the time of the 52 gev photon emission , the @xmath0-ray radiating region must have been located either close to the outer edge of the blr or beyond it .",
    "this is also supported by fact that to avoid severe absorption of high energy photons ( having energy @xmath7350 gev ) by optical - uv radiation of blr radiation field , the emitting region has to be farther out from the blr .",
    "the highest @xmath0-ray flux measured is @xmath9 = 39.1@xmath22.5 and the associated photon index is 2.0@xmath20.1 .",
    "this corresponds to an isotropic luminosity ( @xmath74 ) of ( 5.5@xmath21.1 ) @xmath3 10@xmath75 ergs@xmath12 . assuming @xmath76 , the @xmath0-ray luminosity in the jet frame would be @xmath77 1.4 @xmath3 10@xmath78 ergs@xmath12",
    "this is about 10 times the total available accretion power ( @xmath79 erg s@xmath12 ; assuming radiative efficiency @xmath80 = 10% ) .",
    "the black hole mass of 3c 279 is found in the range of ( 3@xmath18 ) @xmath3 10@xmath81 @xcite , and thus the eddington luminosity @xmath82 ( 0.4@xmath11 ) @xmath3 10@xmath78 ergs@xmath12 .",
    "now , in order for the observed @xmath74 to be lower than @xmath83 , @xmath84 and a beaming factor ( 1 @xmath1 cos @xmath85)@xmath86 .",
    "similar parameters are reported by @xcite for the gev flare of 3c 454.3 during its 2010 november flare .",
    "the cooling timescale of the @xmath0-ray ( @xmath87 gev ) emitting electrons can be calculated as follows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath88 where @xmath89 , is the comoving seed photon energy density for the blr / torus radiation field with characteristic energy @xmath90 10.2/0.2 ev and @xmath91 is the fraction of @xmath92 reprocessed by blr / torus .",
    "this resulted in @xmath93 7 min or 11 min , provided the seed photons for ec process are originated from the blr or torus , respectively .",
    "the obtained cooling time is significantly shorter than that observed decay timescale of the flares , suggesting that the observed flare decrease is controlled not only by radiative cooling , but by a combination of various factors such as the geometry and sub - structure of the emission region or possibly the jet dynamics @xcite .",
    "a significant break / curvature in the @xmath0-ray spectrum is the characteristic properties of powerful fsrqs .",
    "interestingly , this feature is found to be more prominent during the flaring episodes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during p2 period ,",
    "i.e. at the peak of the flare , the bpl photon index @xmath94 before @xmath95 ( @xmath341 gev ) is @xmath96 , thus indicating a rising spectrum , whereas @xmath97 , implying a falling spectrum after @xmath95 .",
    "this observation suggests that probably the peak of the ic mechanism is seen in the lat bandpass and thus the observed shape most likely reflects the energy distribution of the emitting electrons . comparing the shape of the @xmath0-ray spectrum with that seen during 2013 december and 2014",
    "april reveals an interesting observation .",
    "the 2013 december flare exhibited a hard rising spectrum ( @xmath98 , * ? ? ? * ) indicating that the ic mechanism to peak at very high frequencies , whereas 2014 april events showed a steep falling spectrum ( * @xmath99 * , * ? ? ?",
