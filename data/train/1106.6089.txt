    "the spectra of quasars with redshifts @xmath12 are an important probe of the ionisation state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in the early universe .",
    "the intergalactic opacity rapidly rises with increasing redshift , and consequently there has been much debate whether these quasars have been observed before the universe was fully reionised ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "studies of the small windows of transmission observed in close proximity to these objects provide important clues in this respect ( @xcite ) .",
    "these highly ionised `` near zones '' lie between the red edge of the @xcite trough and the quasar emission line , and arise because the hydrogen close to these sources is highly ionised .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter m11 ) have recently reported the highest redshift quasar found to date , ulas j1120@xmath00641 at @xmath1 , discovered using data from the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , @xcite ) . in their analysis of the near zone observed in a low resolution ( @xmath13 ) vlt / fors2 spectrum of moderate signal - to - noise , m11 find the extent and shape of the near zone is distinct from those around the much debated @xmath14 quasars . assuming the quasar is embedded in a homogeneous igm , m11 concluded the observed transmission profile of ulas j1120@xmath00641 is consistent with a surrounding igm for which the volume averaged neutral fraction is @xmath15 at @xmath16 .    in this letter",
    "we examine the implications of the m11 observation in more detail using simulations of radiative transfer through an inhomogeneous igm .",
    "these simulations have successfully explained the properties of near zones observed at @xmath2 in the context of a highly ionised igm ( @xcite ) .",
    "we begin in section 2 by giving a brief overview of near zone sizes . in section 3",
    "we describe our numerical simulations before comparing them directly to the m11 measurement in section 4 . finally in section 5",
    "we discuss the implications of our results and conclude .",

    "further , if the surrounding igm is significantly neutral , the red gunn  peterson ( gp ) damping wing will reduce the observed size of the near zone and absorption may extend redward of the quasar systemic redshift ( @xcite ) . unfortunately , the possibility of confusing this damping wing with a collapsed region with a high column density in an otherwise highly ionised igm complicates matters further .",
    "these issues make the interpretation of the near zones observed around these quasars with respect to the igm ionisation state ambiguous ( @xcite ) .    a summary of the existing measurements of near zone sizes around high redshift quasars , compiled recently by @xcite , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : obs_compiled ] . interestingly , ulas j1120@xmath00641 has a small0456 at @xmath26 ( @xcite ) , but this object is considerably fainter and is consistent with the other @xmath2 quasars on accounting for its fainter luminosity . ] near zone size given its bright absolute ab magnitude , @xmath27 .",
    "this is demonstrated by the evolution of observed near zone sizes with redshift , rescaled to correspond to a common magnitude of @xmath21 , in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : obs_compiled ] .",
    "m11 have noted that the small near zone size around ulas j1120@xmath00641 , coupled with absorption redward of the systemic redshift from a putative red damping wing , may indicate the igm surrounding ulas j1120@xmath00641 is significantly more neutral than around quasars at @xmath14 .",
    "we now investigate this in more detail using realistic synthetic absorption spectra which employ a variety of evolutionary histories for the igm ionisation state .    .",

    "we construct absorption spectra using a high resolution hydrodynamical simulation combined with a line - of - sight radiative transfer code ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulation was performed using the gadget-3 code ( @xcite ) and has a box size of @xmath33 comoving mpc and a gas particle mass of @xmath34 .",
    "a total of 100 sight - lines of length @xmath35 comoving mpc were extracted around haloes identified in the simulation to construct skewers through the igm density , temperature and peculiar velocity field .",

    "furthermore , the ionisation state of the igm in the vicinity of a massive host halo will be biased due the clustering of lower luminosity sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "these models are thus designed to explore a range of different initial fractions in the igm close to the quasar , but _ are not representative of global reionisation histories_.    as we only compute the radiative transfer for the quasar ionising radiation , we also add a simple prescription for regions which are self - shielded from the ionising background . assuming that the typical size of an absorber is the jeans scale ( @xcite )",
    ", the hydrogen number density where an absorber begins to self - shield can be approximated as @xmath43 .",
    "we use this expression to compute the density threshold at which hydrogen is self - shielded _ prior _ to being ionised by the quasar , and set the background photo - ionisation rate to zero in these regions . the weak temperature dependence is computed self - consistently using the gas temperature in our simulations .",

    "[ fig : uvb_models ] displays the resulting neutral hydrogen fraction averaged over all 100 sight - lines assuming @xmath44 and including ( left panel ) and excluding ( right panel ) ionising radiation from the quasar .",
    "the grey curve in the right panel also shows the fraction for uvb1 excluding the self - shielding model .",
    "self - shielded regions become rapidly more common for ultra - violet background ( uvb ) models with decreasing photo - ionisation rates , increasing the volume averaged neutral fraction and producing a patchy ionisation structure along each sight - line .",
    "a summary of the average fractions and incidence of optically thick absorbers in all models which include the self - shielding prescription is given in table 1 .",
    "note that the quasar photo - ionises optically thick absorbers in its vicinity , significantly reducing the incidence of these systems .",
    "however , the impact of this process is reduced for shorter quasar ages or the smaller ionising photon mean free path associated with a larger igm neutral fraction .",
    "we compare the measured transmission profile around ulas j1120@xmath00641 , described in detail by m11 , to two of our simulated sight - lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] . for each sight - line",
    "we consider quasar ages of @xmath45 and @xmath5 , and for each quasar age the effect of optically thick absorbers is illustrated by models which include and exclude the self - shielding approximation .",
    "this qualitative comparison highlights an important point : for an initially neutral igm ( uvb4 , orange curves ) or a partially neutral igm ( uvb3 , blue curves ) and a short quasar bright phase ( @xmath45 ) a prominent damping wing with absorption extending redward of rest frame is present .",
    "however , optically thick absorbers will also have an impact on the near zone transmission profile redward of if a collapsed neutral region is close to the quasar ; the presence of a damped absorber ( dla ) with @xmath46 at @xmath47 , marked by the arrow in the right main panel , demonstrates this .",
    "we may consider the relative likelihood of these possibilities by analysing the transmission profiles for all 100 of our simulated spectra .",
    "considering the moderate signal - to - noise and low resolution of the observed spectrum of ulas j1120@xmath00641 and the difficulty of continuum fitting due to the complexity of the intrinsic and emission , we use two simple properties to characterise the transmission profile for a quantitative comparison .",
    "these are : the distance from the quasar where the transmitted fraction first falls below 10 per cent , @xmath48 ( @xcite ) , and the transmitted fraction at the rest frame @xmath49 wavelength , @xmath50",
    ". these are measured after smoothing the spectra with a box car window of width @xmath51 ( rest frame ) to remove fluctuations on smaller scales due to noise and absorption lines .",
    "the corresponding values for ulas j1120@xmath00641 are @xmath52 and @xmath53 after removing the intrinsic absorption line at rest frame ly@xmath54 .",
    "[ fig : box_whisker ] displays box - whisker and scatter plots of the distribution of these two quantities .",
    "both quantities not only depend on the assumed uvb model but also on how long the quasar has been emitting ionising photons . for example , if self - shielding is included and the quasar has been bright for only @xmath4 yr , both quantities for uvb3 are strongly affected by neutral gas in lyman limit systems ( llss ) .",
    "note also the extended tail in the distribution of @xmath48 and @xmath50 when self - shielding is included for uvb1 and uvb2 .",
    "this arises due to the stochastic occurrence of llss and dlas close to the quasar , and is more prominent the shorter the time the quasar has been bright and thus able to photo - ionise proximate optically thick absorbers .",
    "[ fig : box_whisker ] suggests that the near zone around ulas j1120@xmath00641 is due to either ( i ) a partially ( fully ) neutral surrounding igm with @xmath55 ( 1.0 ) and a quasar bright phase of @xmath56 ( @xmath5 ) or ( ii ) the presence of a high column density system in close proximity to the quasar .",
    "it is important to note , however , that ( i ) and ( ii ) _ are not mutually exclusive_. in our modelling an abundance of optically thick absorbers close to a quasar is a generic prediction due to the shorter ionising photon mean free path expected when the igm is only partially ionised .",
    "our simulations confirm the suggestion of m11 that the spectrum of ulas j1120@xmath00641 is consistent with an already very highly ionised igm ( @xmath57@xmath7 ) if a dla lies close to the quasar .",
    "however , this occurs in only @xmath9 per cent of our sight - lines for @xmath58@xmath10",
    "a fully neutral igm for @xmath59 is ruled out by the near zone size , but is consistent with the observed transmission for a bright phase duration of @xmath5 .",
    "however , ionisation by lower luminosity sources expected to cluster around a massive quasar host halo ( @xcite ) may make this extreme possibility less likely in practice .",
    "we should caution , however , that if we have underestimated the number of proximate dlas present at @xmath60 , if the ionising spectrum of the quasar is much softer than assumed here , or if the environment of the quasar host halo is significantly overdense out to @xmath61 from the quasar ( but see @xcite ) , then we will overestimate the likelihood of a significantly neutral surrounding igm and/or underestimate the age of the quasar .",
    "we have presented a large suite of realistic synthetic transmission spectra which model a variety of evolutionary histories for the ionisation state of the igm surrounding the quasar ulas j1120@xmath00641 .",
    "the transmission profiles depend on the age of the quasar , the photo - ionisation rate in the surrounding igm and the presence of high column density absorbers arising from collapsed , high density regions . for the same initial conditions for the igm ionisation state",
    "the transmission profile varies greatly due to the stochasticity of the optically thick absorbers and igm density distribution along different sight - lines .    inferences regarding the ionisation state of the surrounding igm for transmission around ulas j1120@xmath00641 are correlated with the duration of the optically bright phase of the quasar . for a short bright phase duration of @xmath62 ,",
    "the data are consistent either with an igm with a volume averaged neutral fraction @xmath63 or a highly ionised igm with @xmath64@xmath7 and a proximate dla . on the other hand ,",
    "a bright phase of @xmath5 is consistent with both a highly ionised igm and proximate dla or a fully neutral igm .",
    "however , we find only @xmath9 per cent of our simulated sight - lines exhibit a proximate dla capable of producing a red damping wing , implying the former scenario is less likely ( but see also the caveats in section 4 ) . in either case , this suggests the quasar has not been bright for significantly more than @xmath65 ; a longer bright phase will produce a near - zone which is too large , either by enlarging the quasar region or photo - ionising progressively more proximate optically thick absorbers .",
    "a timescale of @xmath5 is still a factor of five less than the e - folding time of a black hole growing at the eddington rate and radiating with 10 per cent efficiency , as might be expected for a moderately spinning black hole . for a rapidly spinning black hole",
    "the discrepancy would be even larger ( @xcite ) .",
    "unless the black hole grows in an earlier optically obscured phase , this adds to the challenge of building up a black hole with an estimated mass of @xmath66 so early in the history of the universe .",
    "a higher quality spectrum will hopefully exclude or confirm the possible presence of a proximate dla by enabling the identification of associated metal lines and aid in narrowing constraints on the neutral fraction of the surrounding igm .",
    "more general conclusions regarding the ionisation state of the igm at @xmath67 are speculative due to the large fluctuations in the ionisation state expected on scales much larger than probed by the near zone of ulas j1120@xmath00641 ( @xcite ) . if the neutral fraction in the general igm at @xmath68 is indeed @xmath69 this is nevertheless consistent with a constant or weakly decreasing ionising emissivity between @xmath70 .",
    "the rapid change in the photo - ionisation rate by two orders of magnitude or more in our models is balanced by a similar change in the number of llss and thus the mean free path of ionising photons ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . since a constant or perhaps even rising emissivity",
    "is required for the completion of reionisation at @xmath12 ( @xcite ) , this may be compatible with the possibility that reionisation was yet to fully complete by @xmath71 ( @xcite ) .",
    "lastly , the possibility of a significant neutral fraction in the igm surrounding ulas j1120@xmath00641 make it an excellent target for searching for extended emission from the expanding ionisation front ( @xcite ) as well as studies of the igm ionisation state using the redshifted @xmath72 transition ."
