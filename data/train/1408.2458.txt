    "astronomical observations of comets provide an important means to study some of the oldest , most pristine material in our solar system .",

    "depending on the degree of subsequent thermal and radiative processing , some comets likely contain pristine material from the solar nebula or prior interstellar cloud .",
    "studies of cometary ices thus provide unique information on the physics and chemistry of the early stages of the solar system s evolution .",

    "however , previous observations have been unable to ascertain the precise origins of key coma species including hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) , hydrogen iso - cyanide ( hnc ) and formaldehyde ( h@xmath0co ) , and details regarding the possible formation of these species in the coma are not well understood .",
    "hydrogen cyanide is a trace volatile commonly assumed to originate in the nucleus , but a significant source of hcn in the coma has not yet been ruled out . in comet 103p",

    "hydrogen iso - cyanide in cometary comae has been discussed as a possible tracer of pristine interstellar material pre - dating the origin of the solar system @xcite .",

    "lemmon s h@xmath0co map shows two main emission peaks at distances @xmath2 - 1000  km from the continuum peak ( although noise is likely responsible for some of the structure in this map ) .",
    "by contrast , the h@xmath0co distribution for comet ison is dominated by a strong , compact central peak ( with @xmath34  km , compared to @xmath35  km for the psf ) , and has a relatively symmetrical contour pattern , similar to hcn .",
    "further insight into the flux distributions can be obtained by comparison of the azimuthally - averaged radial flux profiles ( fig .",

    "the hcn flux peak was taken as the origin ( apart from the continuum maps , for which the continuum peak was used ) .",
    "the average fluxes inside successive @xmath36-thick annuli are plotted as a function of annulus radius , normalized to unity in the first annulus .",
    "these azimuthally - averaged profiles are dominated by the @xmath37 decay that would be expected from uniform , isotropic expansion ( where @xmath38 is the projected radial coordinate ) .",
    "their shapes are also affected by flux losses due to a lack of short baselines in the array , which become progressively greater for larger structures , and hence , larger cometocentric distances . despite significant noise ripples , the relatively broad hnc and h@xmath0co profiles for lemmon ( and hnc for ison ) are indicative of coma production for these species . for ison",
    ", the h@xmath0co curve lies inside that of hcn , which is a natural consequence of the shorter lifetime of h@xmath0co ( 1,280  s _ vs. _ 23,100  s for hcn at 0.54  au ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cause of the relatively narrow continuum profile for both comets will be discussed in more detail in a future article .",

    "[ fig : vis ] , and corresponding @xmath39 and @xmath6 values are given in table [ tab : lines ] .",
    "+      +      the presented maps and visibilities provide clear evidence regarding the origins of the observed molecules .",
    "the comparison between hcn and hnc is particularly revealing .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vis ] , our visibility data are most consistent with production of hcn as a primary species , released from ( or very near to ) the nuclei of both comets . by contrast , for hnc in comet ison a distributed source is required ( with @xmath46 - 1800 at @xmath47  au ) .",
    "the hnc visibilities in comet lemmon are also consistent with a distributed source , although the error bars are large , so a parent model fits this data equally well .",
    "[ fig : maps]d shows significant quantities of hnc in streams / clumps at projected distances up to 1000  km from the nucleus of comet ison that are not present in hcn .",
    "these suggest that hnc is released in collimated / anisotropic outflows .",
    "the presence of offset hnc emission in lemmon s coma is also consistent with this hypothesis . from interferometric observations of comet c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) , @xcite found evidence for coma production of hnc , and @xcite identified hnc release in jets , whereas hcn was released from ( near to ) the nucleus .",
    "variations in excitation can not plausibly explain the observed differences between these molecules because of the near - identical upper - state energies of the observed hcn and hnc transitions ( table [ tab : lines ] ) .",
    "our measured hcn production rate of @xmath48  s@xmath9 in comet lemmon ( at @xmath49  au on 2013 june 1 ) is in agreement with that observed by @xcite ( at @xmath50  au on 2013 june 20 ) . for ison ,",
    "our value of @xmath51  s@xmath9 on 2013 november 17 is consistent with the value of @xmath52  s@xmath9 measured by @xcite two days earlier .",
    "our @xmath53 ratio of 34% is somewhat larger than the value of 18% found by @xcite , which may be indicative of variations in the relative hcn and hnc production rates with time .",
    "the @xmath53 ratio in comet lemmon was only about 0.4% , which is a factor of @xmath54 less than in comet ison . in a sample of 14 moderately active comets ,",
    "@xcite found a similarly strong change in this ratio with heliocentric distance .",
    "the strong dependence of hnc production rate on @xmath55 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and its asymmetric spatial distribution , imply release of hnc from a refractory component of the nucleus , ejected into the coma in anisotropic streams .",
    "formaldehyde ( h@xmath0co ) has a clear distributed source in both comets .",
    "visibility modeling reveals a parent scale - length of @xmath56 - 2400  km for lemmon and @xmath57 - 330  km for ison ( corresponding to photodissociation rates of @xmath58  s@xmath9 and @xmath59  s@xmath9 , respectively ) .",
    "considering the eight - fold increase in solar insolation expected at ison s heliocentric distance ( @xmath60  au ) compared with lemmon s ( @xmath61  au ) , the order - of - magnitude difference in @xmath62 is consistent with optically - thin photodissociation of the parent in a uniform outflow .",
    "this suggests that the parent of h@xmath0co could be an ( unknown ) organic molecule or simple - addition polymer of low number @xcite .",
    "several previous studies have identified h@xmath0co release in the coma ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and our result is qualitatively similar to those .",
    "the parent scale lengths we derived are smaller than previous estimates , which were in the range ( 4000 - 8000)@xmath63 km .",
    "the results may , however , be consistent given that our observations probe only the inner few thousand km of the coma , whereas previous studies probed distances @xmath64  km .",
    "due to the lack of short baselines , our alma data can not rule out the presence of additional h@xmath0co sources with angular sizes @xmath65 .",
    "we also note that , for previous radio measurements , observational and model uncertainties ( particularly the h@xmath0co excitation ) , were significant ; the latter are less important for our observations , which probe the densest part of the coma where departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium are minimized .    the h@xmath0co production rates we derived for lemmon ( table [ tab : lines ] ) are compatible with the upper limit of @xmath66  s@xmath9 from @xcite on june 20 .",
    "h@xmath0co production rate was 6.9 times greater , despite only a factor of 1.5 increase in hcn .",
    "similar to hnc , previous observations @xcite identified a stronger @xmath55 dependence for @xmath67 than for @xmath68 , which is consistent with our results , although the difference in @xmath67 between lemmon and ison could also be attributed ( at least in part ) to a difference in the chemical composition of the nucleus .    by considering the thermal degradation properties of polyoxymethylene ( pom ) embedded in organic grains ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively , successfully modeled the observed h@xmath0co parent scale length in 1p / halley and the h@xmath0co production rate as a function of @xmath55 in hale - bopp .",
    "the scale - length of pom depends strongly on the sizes and temperatures of the grains . using the model of @xcite assuming a grain outflow velocity and temperature that vary as @xmath69 , for lemmon , our observed h@xmath0co scale length is consistent with grains a few microns in diameter , whereas for ison , grain sizes @xmath70  @xmath71 are required . in reality ,",
    "an ensemble of grain sizes , temperatures and velocities will be present , necessitating detailed modeling to confirm if thermal degradation of pom matches our h@xmath0co observations .",
    "we have presented alma measurements of molecular line and continuum emission from two oort cloud comets : c/2012 f6 ( lemmon ) and c/2012 s1 ( ison ) .",
    "these data reveal the detailed spatial structures and origins of hcn , hnc , h@xmath0co and dust within the innermost few thousand km of the cometary comae . for both comets ,",
    "the dominant source of hcn was from ( or very near to ) the nucleus .",
    "by contrast , the hnc distributions suggest production from a source entering the coma in anisotropic , clumpy stream(s ) .",
    "a distributed h@xmath0co source was identified in both comets .",
    "the scale - length of the putative h@xmath0co parent was on the order of a few hundred km for comet ison and a few thousand km for lemmon , consistent with a parent destruction rate that scales with the intensity of solar radiation .",
    "relative to hcn , comet ison s coma was about an order of magnitude richer in h@xmath0co and hnc than comet lemmon , consistent with a more rapid production of these molecules at ison s smaller heliocentric distance .    the release of hnc and h@xmath0co as product species implies the existence of chemical precursor materials in the coma , which undergo sublimation , photochemical and/or thermal degradation to produce the observed molecules in the gas phase .",
    "heating or photolysis of refractory materials such as dust grains , polymers or other macro - molecules , and their subsequent breakdown at distances @xmath72 - 10,000  km from the nucleus presents the most compelling hypothesis for the origin of the observed h@xmath0co and hnc . the presence ( and composition ) of the hypothesized macro - molecular precursors",
    "will be measured by the cosima instrument on the rosetta spacecraft during its encounter with comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko in 2014 @xcite .",
    "the interferometric data presented in this letter show that routine high - resolution observations of the distributions of molecules and dust grains in cometary comae are now possible .",
    "these observations pave the way for future measurements of spatially , spectrally and temporally - resolved coma emission , from which presently little - understood properties such as the detailed physical structure of the coma ( on size scales of several hundred km ) , and the molecular release and reaction mechanisms , will be derived .",
