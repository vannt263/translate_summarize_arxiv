    "the origin of the observed baryon asymmetry is a fundamental question in modern cosmology .",
    "forty years ago sakharov showed that three conditions must be satisfied to generate the asymmetry @xcite , and since that time various models have been proposed to explain it .",
    "but we still do nt have any idea which , if any , is correct , because baryogenesis usually depends on unknown physics beyond the reach of current experiments and on the unknown early history of the universe beyond the reach of current observations .",
    "a successful cosmological history must produce necessary relics such as the baryon asymmetry , but must also avoid or dilute unwanted cosmological relics such as gravitinos @xcite and moduli @xcite , which can destroy the successful predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite or over - dominate the universe depending on the scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "thermal inflation @xcite provides a compelling solution to the unwanted relic problem .",
    "it occurs after the usual high energy inflation , at an energy scale between the intermediate and electroweak scales , releasing enough entropy at a low enough energy scale to dilute the unwanted relics .    however , the usual baryogenesis scenarios do not work well in the context of thermal inflation because of the large entropy production at a low energy scale .",
    "thus a new model of baryogenesis that fits naturally with thermal inflation is desirable @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we proposed a simple model based on the superpotential throughout this paper . ]",
    "@xmath1 where @xmath2 is the flaton whose roll out from the origin ends thermal inflation and generates the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xmath3-term .",
    "the flaton must also have some unsuppressed couplings to the thermal bath , in order to hold it at the origin during the thermal inflation , but the extra fields involved in these couplings acquire intermediate scale masses after the thermal inflation and hence are only weakly constrained , so we do not include them explicitly .",
    "the baryogenesis is an affleck - dine ( ad ) @xcite type of leptogenesis using @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and triggered by the roll out of the flaton . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we demonstrated the generation of a lepton asymmetry using a simple homogeneous numerical simulation . in the usual high energy ad scenarios , the amplitude of the ad field",
    "would then be damped by the hubble expansion , bringing the field into the symmetric region of the potential near the origin , ensuring that the generated lepton number was conserved .",
    "however , in our low energy ad scenario , the hubble damping is negligible .",
    "instead , we suggested preheating and thermal friction might damp the amplitude of the homogeneous mode , but testing this idea was beyond the scope of our homogeneous numerical simulation .    during preheating ,",
    "energy is transferred from a homogeneous oscillating mode to inhomogeneous modes , resulting in reduction of the amplitude of the homogeneous mode .",
    "well known mechanisms of preheating include parametric resonance @xcite and tachyonic instability @xcite .",
    "usually , it is regarded as an intermediate process between the end of inflation and full reheating , i.e.  thermalization .",
    "however , it can be relevant to the evolution of any condensate , in particular ad condensates .",
    "especially , it may be a crucial effect for low energy ad scenarios , providing an alternative to the usual hubble damping .    in this paper",
    ", we perform three dimensional lattice simulations to numerically investigate the effect of preheating on the amplitude of the ad fields , and hence on the conservation of the lepton number , in our model . in section  [ model ] , we briefly review our model . in section  [ lepto ]",
    ", we describe our scenario for the generation and conservation of the lepton number asymmetry . in sections  [ sim ] and  [ results ] ,",
    "we describe and present the results of our numerical simulations . in section  [ dis ] ,",
    "we discuss interesting points , limitations of our current work , and work to be done in future .    while this work was in progress , and after some of our initial results were reported @xcite , another work on the same topic appeared @xcite .",
    "their simulation was one dimensional , which restricts the number of modes available for preheating , and they chose different initial conditions and parameters , but this is not important at this stage of simulations of our model . ] .",
    "this may explain why their results look somewhat different from ours , though they come to the same conclusion that the model seems to work . unfortunately , there are insufficient details of their simulation in their paper for us to reproduce their results .",
    "we hope to clarify these issues after this paper is published .",
    "our model is based on the superpotential of eq .",

    "the fifth term generates light majorana masses for the neutrinos , and the sixth term stabilizes @xmath2 .",
    "we assume @xmath9 to give the correct values for @xmath3 and the neutrino masses , assuming a flaton mass of the order of the electroweak scale .",
    "initially , @xmath2 is held at origin and so the @xmath3-term vanishes .",
    "therefore @xmath5 and @xmath6 lack the usual mssm @xmath3-term contribution to their mass - squareds .",
    "this allows the possibility that some supersymmetric flat directions involving @xmath5 or @xmath6 , in particular @xmath10 or @xmath11 , may initially be unstable , although they are stable in our vacuum .",
    "thus we consider that @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath2 may have nonzero values , and assume that the other fields remain at the origin .",
    "then , truncating to a single generation for simplicity , gauge fixing and imposing the d - term constraints , we can parameterize those flat directions as @xmath12 with the remaining @xmath13-term constraint @xmath14 and associated gauge constraint @xmath15 which are not easily integrated out .",

    "initially , all the fields are held at the origin due to the finite temperature effective potential .",
    "we assume @xmath47 leaves the origin first .",
    "it will do so via a first order phase transition in which rare bubbles expand to hubble volume size before percolating , since the expansion rate @xmath48 is much less than the scale of the phase transition @xmath23 . as @xmath49 rolls away",
    ", it gives an increasing mass to the fields it couples to .",
    "these then decay and hence are eliminated from the thermal bath , but deposit their energy , including that of their extra mass gained from @xmath49 , back into the thermal bath .",
    "this could lead to two possibilities for @xmath2 s dynamics , depending on @xmath2 s couplings and the detailed dynamics .",
    "some fields are removed from the thermal bath , and if these fields couple to @xmath2 then @xmath2 s finite temperature effective potential could be reduced , possibly triggering @xmath2 s phase transition . in this first case ,",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath2 roll away at the same time , though with @xmath49 in the lead if @xmath50 .",
    "however , the temperature of the thermal bath is raised which would have the opposite effect , tending to prolong the thermal inflation . in this second case",
    ", @xmath49 would have time to settle to its minimum , preheat and maybe even decay or be diluted by the remaining thermal inflation , before @xmath2 undergoes its own first order phase transition , again with rare bubbles expanding to hubble volume size before percolating .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the second case as it seems simpler .",
    "the initial condition for the leptogenesis will then be @xmath2 s phase transition ending the thermal inflation , with @xmath49 in some initial state near its minimum . in this paper ,",
    "we will only attempt to crudely mimick @xmath2 s first order phase transition , as described in section  [ simini ] .",
    "a bound on the initial state of @xmath49 can be estimated as follows .",
    "after @xmath49 rolls away , the energy density in the ad sector is initially @xmath51 the ad sector will decay to the thermal bath at a rate @xmath52 and the rate of transfer of energy from the ad sector to the thermal bath will be @xmath53 therefore the energy transferred in the first hubble time @xmath54 will be much larger than @xmath55 , and so the decay of the ad sector will be able to maintain the thermal inflation .",
    "the thermal inflation will end when @xmath56 , i.e.  after @xmath57    thus , we can expect the initial fluctuations in @xmath49 to be fairly small and well preheated if not thermalized .",
    "however , the leptogenesis seems not very sensitive to this initial state , see section  [ results ] .      when the temperature of the thermal bath drops to around the electroweak scale , it is @xmath2 s turn to roll away from the origin , ending thermal inflation . as @xmath2 rolls out",
    ", @xmath58 acquires linear terms in its potential which force it to become non - zero . when @xmath2 becomes of the order of its vacuum expectation value , @xmath37 acquires an additional contribution to its mass - squared from the term @xmath59 , bringing it , and @xmath36 and @xmath58 , back in towards the origin . at the same time , the phase of @xmath49 is rotated by the term @xmath60 , generating the lepton asymmetry @xmath61    note that the nonzero @xmath58 is necessary to generate the lepton asymmetry , and is also essential to stabilize the dangerous field directions @xmath62 and @xmath63 which would lead one to the deeper non - mssm vacuum @xcite .      in the usual high energy ad scenario ,",
    "the generated asymmetry is conserved because the hubble expansion damps the kinetic energy of the ad field , bringing it into the symmetric region of the potential near the origin . however , in low energy ad scenarios the hubble damping is negligible and the asymmetry could be washed out by rescattering off the asymmetric part of the potential away from the origin .",
    "fortunately , the amplitude of the ad fields can also be damped by the transfer of energy to gradient energy and other fields . in this paper",
    "we focus on the former effect , which generally goes by the name of preheating @xcite .    in our model",
    ", the gradient energy of the flaton initially grows very rapidly as the flaton rolls away from the origin , due to the tachyonic potential in the radial direction and the divergence of trajectories in the angular direction .",
    "this rapid growth flattens off as the flaton settles down to oscillating about its minimum , with modest and declining growth of gradient energy due to the non - quadratic terms in the potential around the minimum .",
    "the formation and decay of flaton toplogical defects also has an effect .",
    "the ad potential has a strong dependence on the flaton , so inhomogeneities in the flaton field are transferred to the ad fields , leading to rapid preheating of the ad fields .",
    "in addition to this , preheating due to the couplings among the ad fields themselves is likely to be significant , but it is difficult to analyze analytically due to the complicated form of the ad potential .",
    "the energy of the ad fields can also be transferred to other fields .",
    "when an ad field passes near the origin , some fields which couple to it , such as quarks , may become sufficiently light that they can be thermally populated .",
    "as the ad field moves away from the origin , the fields become heavy again , extracting energy from the ad field .",
    "this energy is then transferred to the thermal bath , initially composed mostly of gluons , as the fields decay .",
    "this results in a friction like effect , which we call ` thermal friction ' , on the motion of the ad fields when they pass near the origin .",
    "the efficiency of thermal friction will depend on how close the ad field has to pass to the origin for the quark or other field to become light enough to be thermally populated , and also on how high the temperature is .",
    "how close the ad field has to pass to the origin will depend on the couplings and the temperature of the thermal bath .",
    "the initial temperature of the thermal bath may be relatively small , perhaps electroweak scale , but the mssm has a large hierarchy of yukawa couplings .",
    "this should allow first generation quarks and leptons to be thermally populated when an ad field passes only moderately close to the origin .",
    "as the temperature rises , quarks and leptons of the higher generations will also be able to be populated .",
    "acting against these effects , the flaton dependence of the ad potential will tend to transfer energy from the flaton to the ad fields .",
    "the initial flaton energy density @xmath64 is much larger than the initial ad energy density @xmath65 , so there is potentially a lot of energy to be transferred .",
    "however , one would expect the energy flow to decrease as the amplitude of the flaton decreases due to preheating , energy transfer and eventually hubble damping .",
    "the efficiency of these effects will be crucial in determining whether our lepton number asymmetry survives .",
    "however , it is unclear how efficient any of these effects is and even which of them is dominant .",
    "so , to start somewhere , in this paper we analyze the preheating effect numerically , which also includes the energy flow from the flaton to the ad fields .",
    "once the amplitude of the ad fields has been damped sufficiently for the lepton violating terms @xmath66 and @xmath60 to become negligible , @xmath67 will be conserved .",
    "we denote this initial time by @xmath68 .",
    "the ad fields will complete their decay to the thermal bath while the temperature is still above the electroweak scale , and so sphaleron processes will convert our lepton asymmetry to a baryon asymmetry",
    ". finally , the flaton decay completes , diluting the baryon asymmetry .",
    "we denote this final time by @xmath69 .",
    "the final baryon asymmetry is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are energy density and temperature of the universe .",
    "we use the factor @xmath73 to give a dimensionless measure of the efficiency of the lepton asymmetry generation and preservation .",
    "it can be interpreted roughly as the ratio of lepton number density to the total ad number density when the ad fields start oscillating .",
    "we expect @xmath74 and @xmath75 as described in section  [ physpara ] and ref .",
    "the last factor in eq .",
    "( [ nb ] ) depends on the equation of state of the flaton .",
    "if the preheating of the flaton only populates modes with @xmath76 , then the flaton would have @xmath77 .",
    "the energy flow from the flaton sector to the ad sector could also affect this factor , but , although this flow is likely significant from the ad point of view , we guess it is not so significant from the flaton point of view . with these assumptions ,",
    "one expects @xmath78 thus , we obtain @xmath79 compared with the observational result @xmath80",

    "expand and percolate .",
    "the typical size of a bubble just before percolation is expected to be slightly smaller than the hubble radius .",
    "this introduces a scale much larger than the inverse electroweak scale typical of the rest of the dynamics , making it difficult to simulate both the phase transitions and the leptogenesis dynamics simultaneously .",
    "we leave detailed analytic and numerical investigation of these initial conditions to a subsequent paper , and here just use a simple ansatz that covers a range of possibilities , hopefully without missing too much relevant physics .",
    "we do not include a thermal bath as after the fields roll away from the origin , they decouple from the thermal bath , apart from effects like thermal friction which we plan to consider in a subsequent paper .",

    "this suggests that the fluctuations of the ad fields acquired from those of the flaton through their couplings dominate over any initial fluctuations of @xmath49 .",
    "the lepton asymmetry declines slowly at late times .",

    "the flaton has an initial homogeneous displacement larger than the fluctuations , so that it rolls away along a specific direction with relatively small fluctuations , leading to slower growth of gradient energy .",

    "after the initial transient stage , the amplitudes of the ad fields start to grow again .",

    ", the flaton spectrum is cut off at high @xmath91 , which is consistent with theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "the preheating of the flaton sector is transferred to the ad sector through the flaton - dependent potential of the ad fields .",
    "remarkably , ad @xmath91-modes higher than the physical cutoff in the flaton sector are also rapidly populated hitting the high @xmath91 lattice cutoff before @xmath124 with rapid energy flow from lower to higher @xmath91-modes .",
    "as a result , the ad lattice modes are fully thermalized for most of the simulation .",
    "once all the lattice modes have been thermalized , preheating is truncated artificially in the simulation , even though it may continue in reality .",
    "this suggests that the reliability of the lattice results will be compromised at late times , as energy that physically should be flowing into the higher @xmath91 modes is artificially , numerically shunted into the modes that are present in the grid .",
    "this effect should artifically weaken preheating and we believe it accounts for some of the late time decrease in the lepton asymmetry seen in figs .",

    "the flaton dependence of the ad potential initially generates potential energy for the ad fields , which is then rapidly converted to kinetic and gradient energy . at late times",
    ", the ad lattice modes have thermalized and the energy from the flaton sector flows into kinetic , gradient and potential energies of the ad fields .",
    "the total energy flow from flaton to ad fields is shown in figs .",
    "[ d4cppenergytot ] and [ d0cppenergytot ] .",
    "the qualitative features of figs .",
    "[ d4cppenergytot ] and [ d0cppenergytot ] can be understood from the energy flow rate into the ad sector @xmath132 which is obtained by use of the equation of motion of @xmath2 .",
    "we can separate the energy flow into three stages . at the first stage ,",
    "the ad potential is lifted up causing the ad fields to oscillate with large amplitude .",
    "then , preheating spreads energy into higher @xmath91-modes , reducing the field amplitudes .",
    "this results in decreasing energy flow rate . finally , the ad sector preheating is saturated due to the lattice cutoff , so energy from the flaton sector starts being accumulated in a fixed number of modes .",
    "this causes increasing field amplitude and therefore increasing energy flow rate .",
    "thus , the late time behavior of the energy flow depends on the efficiency of preheating , which in turn depends on the initial conditions and the lattice cutoff .",
    "the dependence on the initial conditions explains the different rates of decline in figs .",
    "[ d4l ] and [ d0l ] .",
    "we expect a smaller energy flow for a finer lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ d0cppvslattice ] , but this will be the case only until a physical cutoff of the ad preheating appears .",
    "if the preheating becomes saturated due to a physical cutoff and the energy flow is still significant , then we may need the help of thermal friction which could provide another channel for energy to flow away .",
    "we plan to study these issues in a future paper .",
    "recently , we proposed a minimal extension of the mssm which naturally gives rise to thermal inflation followed by ad leptogenesis .",
    "the expansion rate @xmath133 at the end of thermal inflation is too low for the usual ad hubble damping mechanism to conserve the generated lepton asymmetry , but we proposed that preheating and thermal friction may perform the same function .",
    "however , those processes are very complicated and not easy to study analytically even in a simple case .",
    "it is even difficult to know which of these processes will dominate since it depends on the details of the dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we numerically analyzed the effect of preheating on the conservation of the lepton number asymmetry in our model .",
    "the lepton number asymmetry is generated as the flaton rolls away at the end of thermal inflation .",
    "it will be conserved if the preheating of the ad sector is efficient enough that the homogeneous oscillation amplitudes of the ad fields are quickly reduced , bringing the fields into the symmetric region of the potential near the origin .",
    "the preheating process starts in the flaton sector by the magnification of the initial fluctuations , that include vacuum and thermal contributions , as the flaton rolls away from the origin and oscillates about the minimum of its potential . since the flaton potential has negative curvature near the origin and somewhat larger angle - dependent curvature along angular directions far from the origin , very rapid tachyonic preheating is dominant initially .",
    "when the flaton oscillates around its minimum preheating continues due to the anharmonic terms in its potential ( weak parametric resonance ) .",
    "the ad fields in our model have flaton - dependent masses , so their mass squareds vary with time and even change sign .",
    "this violently transfers inhomogeneities in the flaton sector to the ad sector .",
    "the preheating amplifies high @xmath91-modes in the ad sector much more rapidly than in the flaton sector , so that the ad fields quickly thermalize over the range of momenta present in our lattice .",
    "if we were able to simulate with higher resolution we would expect to see even more efficient preheating .",
    "the flaton sector also feeds energy into the ad sector .",
    "the energy flow rate depends on the amplitudes of the fields and the time derivative of the flaton .",
    "this means that if the flaton and ad fields are efficiently preheated , resulting in small field values , the energy flow rate will be small . since the ad sector preheating is very rapid initially ,",
    "the energy flow in the initial transient stage is not harmful in terms of lepton number conservation .",
    "but the preheating is quickly saturated , causing the energy flowing from the flaton sector to accumulate in a fixed number of modes .",
    "this causes an increase in the oscillation amplitude of the ad fields , which can wash out the asymmetry , as well as increase the energy flow rate . in this sense ,",
    "the balance between the preheating in the ad sector and the energy flow from the flaton sector is crucial for the late time evolution of the lepton asymmetry .",
    "there is a large structure in the spatial distribution of the lepton asymmetry , which may be a quasi - stable q - ball , but it is not harmful since it soon disappeared without much effect on the asymmetry . the origin of this object is not clear . including the renormalisation of the ad masses should make such objects less stable , assuming it is a type of q - ball .",
    "the outcome of all these effects is , as the simulations show , that the lepton asymmetry in our model is reasonably well conserved at late times due to the efficient preheating , and is not affected much by the initial state of the ad fields .",
    "the lepton asymmetry decreases slowly at late times but the rate is small enough for one to expect that sufficient lepton asymmetry will be preserved for long enough for other physical processes like thermal friction to start working and stop the decrease .",
    "there are several limitations to this work , which may affect the conservation of the lepton asymmetry .",
    "firstly , all of our results may depend crucially on the initial conditions .",
    "we found that the initial state of the ad fields has little effect on the lepton asymmetry .",
    "the initial state of the flaton , however , affects the preheating of the ad fields and the energy flow , and thus may affect the conservation of the lepton asymmetry .",
    "a proper treatment of this issue will thus require simulating flaton bubbles .",
    "once this has been done , it becomes possible to determine the regions of parameter space in which our model works .",
    "the limited size and resolution of the lattice also affect the preheating efficiency .",
    "since the lattice cutoff is reached early in our current simulation , it restricts the preheating artificially .",
    "a larger and finer lattice would provide more available modes for preheating and thermalization such that it would weaken or even stop the decreasing behavior of the lepton asymmetry .",
    "finally , we may have to consider thermal friction as another source of damping for the homogeneous mode , if it turns out that preheating is not efficient enough to conserve the lepton asymmetry by itself given realistic initial conditions for the flaton .",
    "we postpone all of these issues to future work .    in summary",
    ", our simulation revealed that preheating is efficient and rapid enough to conserve the lepton asymmetry in our low energy ad leptogenesis model , replacing the hubble damping of the usual high energy ad scenario .",

    "<S> previously , we proposed a model of low energy affleck - dine leptogenesis in the context of thermal inflation . the lepton asymmetry is generated at the end of thermal inflation , which occurs at a relatively low energy scale with the hubble parameter somewhere in the range @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thus hubble damping will be ineffective in bringing the affleck - dine field into the lepton conserving region near the origin , leaving the possibility that the lepton number could be washed out . </S>",
    "<S> previously , we suggested that preheating could damp the amplitude of the affleck - dine field allowing conservation of the lepton number . in this paper , we demonstrate numerically that preheating does efficiently damp the amplitude of the affleck - dine field and that the lepton number is conserved as the result . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to demonstrating a crucial aspect of our model , it also opens the more general possibility of low energy affleck - dine baryogenesis . </S>"
