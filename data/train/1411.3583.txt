    "recent observational evidences from ia supernovae , cmbr via wmap , galaxy redshift surveys via sdss indicated that the universe is going through an accelerated expansion of late @xcite . with this discovery the incompatibility of general relativity ( gr ) as a self sufficient theory of gravity came into light .",
    "since no possible explanation of this phenomenon could be attributed in the framework of einstein s gr , a proper modification of the theory was required that will successfully incorporate the late cosmic acceleration . as the quest began , two different approaches regarding this modification came into existence .",
    "according to the first approach , cosmic acceleration can be phenomenally attributed to the presence of a mysterious negative energy component popularly known as _ dark energy ( de ) _",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we modify the right hand side of the einstein s equation , i.e. in the matter sector of the universe .",
    "latest observational data shows that the contribution of de to the energy sector of the universe is @xmath1 . with the passage of time ,",
    "extensive search saw various candidates for de appear in the scene .",
    "some of the popular ones worth mentioning are chaplygin gas models @xcite , quintessence scalar field @xcite , phantom energy field @xcite , etc .",
    "a basic feature of these models is that , they violate the strong energy condition i.e. , @xmath2 , thus producing the observed cosmic acceleration .",
    "recent reviews on de can be found in @xcite    a different section of cosmologists resorted to an alternative approach for explaining the expansion .",
    "this concept is based on the modification of the gravity sector of gr , thus giving birth to modified gravity theories . a universe associated with a tiny cosmological constant ,",
    "i.e. the @xmath3cdm model served as a prototype for this approach .",
    "it was seen that the model could satisfactorily explain the recent cosmic acceleration and passed a few solar system tests as well . but with detailed diagnosis it was revealed that the model was paralyzed with a few cosmological problems . out of these ,",
    "two major problems that crippled the model till date are the fine tuning problem ( ftp ) and the cosmic coincidence problem ( ccp ) .",
    "the ftp refers to the large discrepancy between the observed values and the theoretically predicted values of cosmological parameters .",
    "numerous attempts to solve this problem can be found in the literature . among them ,",
    "the most impressive attempt was undertaken by weinberg in @xcite .",
    "although the approaches for the solutions are different , yet , almost all of them are basically based on the fact that the cosmological constant may not assume an extremely small static value at all times during the evolution of the universe ( as predicted by gr ) , but its nature should be rather dynamical @xcite .",
    "these drawbacks reduced the effectiveness of the model , as well as its acceptability , and hence alternative modifications of gravity was sought for .",
    "some of the popular models of modified gravity that came into existence in recent times are loop quantum gravity @xcite , brane gravity @xcite , _",
    "f(r ) _ gravity @xcite , _",
    "f(t ) _ gravity @xcite , etc .",
    "reviews on extended gravity theories can be found in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will consider _",
    "f(g ) _ model as the theory of gravity @xcite . over the years",
    ", several modifications to gr have been achieved , by generalizing the einstein - hilbert lagrangian used in gr . @xmath4 and @xmath5 gravities are common examples of such modifications .",
    "gauss - bonnet ( gb ) modification to gr is another way of modifying the einstein gravity that has gained popularity over the past few years , because it is considered as the low energy limit of string theory . in this modification ,",
    "one generally adds quadratic terms , specifically the gb terms , which involve second order curvature invariants .",
    "but as it turns out to be , the gb term becomes trivial in 4-dimension , and hence , it is used from another form of modified gravity , namely , the modified gb gravity @xcite . here an arbitrary function of the gb term , @xmath0 is added to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , to bring about the modification .    in @xcite bisabr",
    "studied cosmological coincidence problem in the background of _",
    "f(r ) _ gravity .",
    "motivated by bisabr s work , we dedicate the present assignment to the study of the coincidence problem in _",
    "f(g ) _ gravity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : basic equations of _ fg _ gravity are furnished in section 2 . in section 3 , we discuss the coincidence problem .",
    "the set - up for the present study is discussed in section 4 .",
    "we illustrate the designed set - up by a few examples in section 5 , and finally the paper ends with a short conclusion in section 6 .",
    "the 4-dimensional action in _ f(g ) _ gravity is given by , @xmath6d^{4}x+s_{m}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the ricci scalar curvature , @xmath0 is a generic function of the gauss - bonnet topological invariant @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the matter action .",
    "varying the above action with respect to the metric one can obtain the field equation as , @xmath11\\nabla^{\\rho}\\nabla^{\\sigma}f'(g)+\\left(gf'(g)-f\\right)g_{\\mu\\nu}=t_{\\mu\\nu}^{m}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the einstein tensor , @xmath13 is the energy momentum tensor of matter .",
    "here we consider @xmath14 and prime denotes ordinary derivative with respect to @xmath8 . for spatially flat robertson - walker metric @xmath15",
    "we have @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the hubble parameter and dot denotes the time derivative .",
    "considering the universe to be filled with pressureless dark matter under the assumption of a flat universe the modified friedmann equations for _ f(g ) _ gravity are ,    @xmath18    @xmath19    the energy conservation equations are given by , @xmath20 @xmath21    here @xmath22 is the eos parameter of the energy sector and @xmath23 is the interaction between the matter and the energy sector of the universe .",
    "the eos parameter is given by ,    @xmath24",
    "the cosmic coincidence problem has been a serious issue in recent times regarding various dark energy models .",
    "recent cosmological observations have indicated that the densities of the matter sector and the de sector of the universe are almost identical in late times .",
    "it is known that the matter and the energy component of the universe have evolved independently from different mass scales in the early universe , then how come they reconcile to identical mass scales in the late universe ! this is major problem having its roots in the very formation of the theory . almost all the de models known till date more or less suffer from this phenomenon .    various attempts to solve the coincidence problem can be found in literature . among them",
    "the most impressive are the ones which use the concept of a suitable interaction between the matter and the dark energy components of the universe , as given in the conservation equations ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) . in this approach",
    ", it is considered that the two sectors of the universe have not evolved independently from different mass scales .",
    "instead they evolve together , interacting with each other , allowing a mutual flow of matter and energy between the two components . due to this exchange ,",
    "the densities of the two components coincide in the present universe .",
    "although the concept seems to be a really promising one , yet a problem persists .",
    "there is no universally accepted interaction term , introduced by a fundamental theory known till date .",
    "it is known that both dark energy and dark matter are not universally accepted facts , but concepts which are still at the speculation level . due to this unknown nature of both dark energy and dark matter",
    ", it is not possible to derive an expression for the interaction term ( @xmath23 ) from the first principles .",
    "such a situation , demands us to use our logical reasoning and propose various expressions for @xmath23 that will be reasonably acceptable .",
    "the late time dominating nature of dark energy indicates that @xmath23 must be considered a small and positive value . on the other hand a large negative value of interaction will make the universe dark energy dominated from the early times , thus leaving no scope for the condensation of galaxies .",
    "so the most logical choice for interaction should contain a product of energy density and the hubble parameter , because it is not only physically but also dimensionally justified .",
    "so @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the dark energy density .",
    "since here we are not planning to add any dark energy by hand , so the effective density resulting from the extra terms of the modified gb gravity , @xmath27 will replace @xmath26 .",
    "this leads us to three basic forms of interactions as given below @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the coupling parameters of the respective interaction models .",
    "it is worth mentioning that due to its simplicity the most widely used interaction model is the @xmath29-model and is available widely in literature @xcite .",
    "in this note we address the coincidence problem in _",
    "f(g ) _ gravity . _",
    "f(g ) _ gravity has evolved over the past decade as a candidate for modified gravity theory . from the literature",
    "it is known that _",
    "f(g ) _ gravity is itself self competent in producing the late cosmic acceleration without resorting to any forms of dark energy . therefore in order to keep it simple and reasonable , we do not consider any separate dark energy components in the present study .",
    "the extra terms of the modified gb gravity provides the exotic nature and is considered as the dark energy .",
    "we consider the ratio of the densities of matter and dark energy as , @xmath32 .",
    "our aim is to devise a set - up that will aim towards a possible solution to the coincidence problem .",
    "we also want to set up a filtering process that will separate the favorable @xmath0 models , that produce a stationary value of the ratio of the component densities , @xmath33 from the unfavorable ones that do not .",

    "hence @xmath105 , makes the realization of a stationary phase extremely difficult .",

    "looking at the plots 4 and 5 , it must also be mentioned that the b - interaction term is much more preferable compared to the other interactions , since it helps us to realize a continuous stationary phase between dark energy and dark matter after a certain point of time in the cosmological time - line , thus complying with the recent observational data .",
