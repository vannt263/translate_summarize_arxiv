    "magnetic field , an important component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , is thought to be a key player in various active astrophysical phenomena . however , the dynamical role of cosmic ray ( cr ) ( another component of ism ) in astrophysical activities has been underrated for quite a long time , although the energy density of crs is of the same order as that of magnetic field and turbulent gas motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the system exhibits some unique instabilities , e.g. , squeezing instability ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the influence of crs on various instabilities has been studied by means of linear analysis and mhd simulations , for instance , the evolution of parker instability @xcite , parker - jeans instability @xcite , magneto - rotational instability @xcite , kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite , and also galactic dynamo @xcite .",
    "the results of these works showed that in some cases the growth rate has some intriguing dependence on the cosmic ray pressure and the coupling of cr and thermal plasma ( i.e. , the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient ) .",
    "for example , while the cosmic ray pressure may effectively enhance the parker and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , small diffusion coefficient can impede the growth @xcite .",
    "moreover , the diffusion coefficient may determine the fragmentation direction of parker - jeans instability @xcite .",
    "magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) is an important mechanism in differentially rotating astrophysical objects with magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that local and extremely powerful instability in a differentially rotating systems with a weak magnetic field destabilize the systems strongly .",
    "as mri occurs in accretion disk , the magnetic energy is amplified inside the disk , and angular momentum transfer takes place , which is important for obtaining high enough accretion rate to explain observations . the efficiency of angular momentum transport can be estimated from the saturation level of the magnetic energy , and @xcite showed that the saturation level of mri using the resistive mhd simulations .",
    "@xcite studied the influence of crs on mri in the case of dominant toroidal magnetic field in the linear regime , and showed that the cr pressure enhanced the growth of mri and the diffusion of crs suppressed the growth of mri . in this work , we analyze the case of dominant poloidal magnetic field by linear perturbation analysis and mhd numerical simulations .",

    "we find similar enhancement of mri by cr pressure as in @xcite . however , we notice that diffusion of crs enhances the growth of mri as well .",

    "similar to the shearing box model , we also study the two values of the cr diffusion coefficient , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 as the representative values in accordance with the result of linear analysis ( see the right panel of figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows the time evolution of the distributions of the magnetic field and the cr pressure . in the figure the white curves are the magnetic field lines and",
    "the gray - scale contour shows the cr pressure .",
    "the top three panels show the time evolution for the case of @xmath162 , and the bottom three panels for the case of @xmath163 .    in the case of small diffusion coefficient @xmath162 ,",
    "the growth of the instability is slow .",
    "it is still rather insignificant around @xmath179 , and the instability starts to grow around @xmath180 ( see upper panels of figure![fig10 ] ) . on the other hand , in the case of larger diffusion coefficient",
    ", the instability is already approaching its saturation around @xmath181 ( lower panels of figure  [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "as the growth of the instability proceeds , the low cr - pressure region penetrates into the high cr - pressure region around @xmath181 .    in order to understand the mechanism causing different growth rate of mri , we compared the case of @xmath163 with the case of @xmath182 .",
    "they show similar growth process of the instability in magnetic fields except that the growth rates are different .",
    "the left panels of figure  [ fig12 ] shows the density ( gray scale contour ) , velocity distribution ( white arrows ) , and a reference magnetic field line ( white curve ) for @xmath182 at @xmath183 and @xmath163 at @xmath180 .",
    "the black arrow at the top - right corner is half the unit velocity , the keplerian rotation speed at @xmath184 .",
    "high density region is created where the mri is growing strongly .",
    "the right panels of figure  [ fig12 ] shows the cr pressure distribution , the density distribution , and the toroidal velocity distribution along a reference magnetic field line for @xmath182 and 10.0 .",
    "the cr pressure distribution differs significantly for different @xmath16 . for large @xmath16",
    "the cr pressure becomes uniform along the magnetic field line , while for small @xmath16 the cr pressure varies in sync with the plasma density .",
    "density attains its maximum at the region where the mri is growing strongly , and its value is higher for the larger @xmath16 .",
    "the toroidal velocity varies anti - sync with density , but the distributions for different @xmath16 are more or less the same .",
    "we studied the mri with the effect of crs by linear stability analysis and mhd simulation .",
    "we examined two different models : the shearing box model and the differentially rotating cylinder model .    in linear stability analysis",
    ", we reduced the set of perturbation equation to two first order odes and obtain the dispersion relation using shooting method .",
    "for the shearing box model , the growth rate barely depends on the value of @xmath16 ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "this is starkly different from previous studies on related topics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which showed considerably dependence of the growth rate on the value of @xmath16 .",
    "the reason lies in the distribution of cr pressure distribution in the initial unperturbed background .",
    "if the cr pressure is uniform distributed in the unperturbed background ( as in the case of the shearing box model ) , then the growth rate will be ( almost ) independent of the value of @xmath16 .",
    "however , for non - uniform cr pressure distribution , the growth rate will depends on @xmath16 .",
    "we confirmed this in our second model , the differentially rotating cylinder model , which has a non - uniform cr pressure distribution in the unperturbed background .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the dependence of the growth rate on @xmath16 .",
    "the growth rate increases as @xmath16 increases , and saturated at large @xmath16 ( see right panel of figure  [ fig7 ] for the maximum growth rate ) .",
    "this is consistent with the studies on parker instability and parker - jeans instability @xcite .",
    "however , there are some subtle differences . at small values of @xmath16 ( @xmath185 ) ,",
    "the maximum growth rate is more or less the same in mri ( see right panel of figure  [ fig7 ] ) , but this characteristics was not observed in the study of parker instability @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the dependence of the growth rate on the ratio of cr pressure to thermal pressure @xmath49 .",
    "the growth rate increases as @xmath49 increases samely in @xmath16 .",
    "an increase of @xmath49 is equivalent to a decrease of the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure .",
    "this result is somewhat different from the result by @xcite that the growth rate becomes larger as the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure is larger .",
    "this difference is perhaps come from our formalism and the non - uniformity of the unperturbed state . in our treatment",
    "( see equation  [ iccyl3 ] ) the density distribution is independent of @xmath49 once we keep the the sum of cr pressure and thermal pressure fixed .",
    "it is more convenient to study the effect of @xmath49 without changing the density profile .    in the mhd simulation for the shearing box model",
    ", we also obtained the result that the growth rate of mri does not depend on the @xmath16 ( see figure  [ fig9 ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig10 ] , we compared the growth rate obtained from the linear analysis with that obtained from the mhd simulation , and they agreed well . from these results ( linear analysis and mhd simulations ) , we can conclude that the growth of the mri does not depend on the value of the cr diffusion coefficient @xmath16 when the initial background cr pressure distribution is uniform , at least in the linearly growing phase .    in the mhd simulation for the differentially rotating cylinder model , we find that the growth rate of mri under the non - uniform cr pressure background does depend on the value of the cr diffusion coefficient @xmath16 .",
    "the growth of mri becomes faster as the @xmath16 becomes larger ( see figure  [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent with that obtained from the linear stability analysis .",
    "this result shows that the mri with cosmic - ray diffusion strongly depends on the distribution of the cr pressure background .",
    "if the distribution of crs is non - uniform , the growth rate of mri may change drastically with the value of @xmath16 .    in the differentially rotating cylinder model ,",
    "the dependence of the mri growth rate on the value of @xmath16 is caused by the difference in cr pressure distribution along a magnetic field line .",
    "a general property of diffusion is to smooth out irregularities and to reduce the gradient of the relevant quantity .",
    "if the diffusion coefficient is large ( i.e. , weak coupling between plasma and cr ) , the cr pressure ( or cr energy ) approaches uniform distribution quickly even if it were driven away from uniformity by the growth of mri . under such circumstances , the cr pressure gradient along a magnetic field line becomes small and is not able to curb the outward movement of plasma by the centrifugal force .",
    "consequently , high density region is formed at the location where mri is growing and the magnetic field line develops the loop like structure .",
    "if the diffusion coefficient is small , the cr pressure maintains non - uniformity longer and hinders the outward movement of the plasma .",
    "hence the density is smaller at the location where mri is growing when compare with the large diffusion coefficient case .",
    "on the other hand , the toroidal velocity distribution is not sensitive to the value of @xmath16 ( see right panels of figure  [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "this means that the depicted magnetic field line in the case of small or large diffusion coefficient ( @xmath16=0.01 or 10.0 ) rotates with the same rotation speed profile .",
    "therefore , the centrifugal force becomes larger at the higher density region and the growth rate becomes larger .    from these results ,",
    "we speculate that the effect of crs on mri will be weak in the phase that the turbulence is sufficiently grown up and the distribution of cr pressure approaches uniform . only in the phase when the turbulence is still growing and the cr pressure is non - uniform",
    "will the effect of crs on mri become significant .",
