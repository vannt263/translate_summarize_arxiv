    "strange quarks represent the lightest quark flavor not present in the valence component of the nucleon",
    ". their study can thus provide insight into sea quark effects in the nucleon in isolated fashion .",
    "the two most fundamental properties of the nucleon are its mass and spin .",
    "the investigation presented here focuses on the extent to which those two properties are influenced by the strange quark degrees of freedom .",
    "the strange contributions to nucleon mass and spin can be characterized by the matrix elements @xmath9 \\label{matel1}\\ ] ] and @xmath10 respectively , where @xmath11 denotes a nucleon state with spin polarized in the @xmath12-direction . in the case of the scalar matrix element , the vacuum expectation value , i.e. , the vacuum strange scalar condensate , is subtracted ; the intention is , of course , to measure the strangeness content of the nucleon _ relative _ to the vacuum . in the case of the axial matrix element ,",
    "no subtraction is necessary since the corresponding vacuum expectation value vanishes .",
    "note that @xmath1 measures specifically the contribution of strange quark spin to nucleon spin ; strange quark angular momentum constitutes a separate contribution not considered here .    aside from representing a fundamental characteristic of the nucleon in its own right , the scalar strange content @xmath0 is also an important parameter in the context of dark matter searches @xcite . assuming that the coupling of dark matter to baryonic matter is mediated by the higgs field",
    ", the dark matter detection rate depends sensitively on the quark scalar matrix elements in the nucleon , cf . ,",
    "e.g , the neutralino - nucleon scalar cross - section considered in @xcite .",
    "one a priori reasonable scenario is that the strange quark furnishes a particularly favorable channel @xcite , since , on the one hand , it features a much larger yukawa coupling to the higgs field than the light quarks , and , on the other hand , is not so heavy as to be only negligibly represented in the nucleon s sea quark content . as a consequence , an accurate estimate of @xmath0 is instrumental in assessing the discovery potential for dark matter candidates .",
    "the contribution of strange quark spin to nucleon spin @xmath1 is , in principle , more directly accessible to experiment than @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath1 represents the first moment of the strange quark helicity distribution @xmath13 ( including both quarks and antiquarks ) as a function of the momentum fraction @xmath14 .",
    "the helicity distribution can be determined via inclusive deep inelastic scattering and semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "however , its extraction in practice still has to rely to a certain extent on assumptions about the dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath14 , even in the semi - inclusive channels ( which furnish direct information on @xmath13 ) , because of the limitations in accessing small @xmath14 experimentally .",
    "complementary information about @xmath1 is obtained from the strange axial form factor of the nucleon @xmath15 , which can be extracted by combining data from parity - violating elastic electron - proton scattering and elastic neutrino - proton scattering @xcite .",
    "extrapolation to zero momentum transfer , @xmath16 , again yields an estimate of @xmath1 . depending on the specific extrapolations and/or model assumptions adopted in determining @xmath1 via the various aforementioned avenues , both significantly negative values for @xmath1",
    "have been put forward @xcite , as well as values compatible with zero @xcite .",
    "an independent determination of @xmath1 via lattice qcd , as undertaken in the present work , thus can be useful in several ways . apart from shedding light on the fundamental question of the decomposition of nucleon spin , it can contribute constraints to phenomenological fits of polarized parton distribution functions . furthermore , it influences spin - dependent dark matter cross sections @xcite ; although more accurate determinations of the scalar matrix elements discussed further above constitute the most urgent issue in reducing hadronic uncertainties in dark matter searches , @xmath1 also plays a significant role in that context .    a number of lattice qcd investigations of strange quark degrees of freedom in the nucleon",
    "have recently been undertaken@xcite , the majority of which have focused specifically on the scalar content .",
    "studies of the latter have proceeded via two avenues : on the one hand , one can directly determine the matrix element @xmath17 via the appropriate disconnected three - point function ; this methodology was adopted in @xcite and also in the present work , as described in detail further below .",
    "a study of techniques suited to improve the efficiency of this approach has been presented in @xcite . on the other hand , a somewhat less direct inference of the scalar strange quark content of the nucleon is possible via the study of the baryon spectrum , which is related via the feynman - hellmann theorem @xmath18 to the corresponding sigma terms for the baryon state @xmath19 and quark flavor @xmath20 .",
    "this avenue has been pursued in @xcite , and a related methodology , combining lattice hadron spectrum data with chiral perturbation theory , was pursued in @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of these various investigations of the scalar strange quark content of the nucleon are diverse .",
    "they include @xmath21 calculations , in which the strange quark degrees of freedom are quenched @xcite , but also @xmath22 @xcite and even @xmath23 @xcite calculations . in some cases , lattice data at only one pion mass have been obtained to date and no extrapolation to the physical point has been attempted .",
    "the most stringent results obtained at the physical point including fully dynamical strange quarks were reported in @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite quotes @xmath24 in the @xmath22 case , and @xmath25 in the @xmath23 case ; translated to @xmath0 itself using @xmath26 in the @xmath5 scheme at a scale of @xmath6 @xcite , these correspond to @xmath27 for @xmath22 and @xmath28 for @xmath23 . on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite report significantly lower values . in @xcite , both direct three - point function calculations as well as indirect determinations via the feynman - hellmann theorem are used to arrive at a bound @xmath29 . in @xcite , a more indirect analysis using lattice hadron spectrum data and chiral perturbation theory yields @xmath30 , which translates to @xmath31 .",
    "the results obtained in the present work are of comparable accuracy , @xmath32 , cf .",
    "( [ ftsfinal ] ) , and are more consistent with the higher values reported in @xcite .    the strange axial matrix element @xmath1 , on the other hand , has also been investigated in @xcite .",
    "apart from the exploratory study @xcite , which , however , did not attempt to renormalize the results nor extrapolate them to the physical pion mass , these investigations were based on dynamical quark ensembles containing only the two light flavors in the quark sea ; the present lattice investigation , on the other hand , employs @xmath22 gauge ensembles , thus treating the strange quark degrees of freedom in dynamical fashion .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath1 obtained on this basis are renormalized and chirally extrapolated , yielding the estimate @xmath7 , cf .",
    "( [ dsfinal ] ) , at the physical point in the @xmath5 scheme at a scale of @xmath6 . within the uncertainties ,",
    "this nevertheless remains compatible with the values obtained in the aforementioned other studies , though it is about 50% larger in magnitude .",
    "this suggests that systematic adjustments to the results quoted in those works through unquenching of the strange quark degrees of freedom , renormalization , and chiral extrapolation are not severe .    aside from the two quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 considered in the present work , lattice investigations of the strange quark structure within the nucleon have also considered generalizations to non - zero momentum transfer , i.e. , form factors @xcite , including calculations of the strange electric and magnetic form factors , which are of interest in the context of corresponding experimental efforts employing parity - violating electron - proton scattering @xcite .",
    "furthermore , also the strange quark momentum fraction and strange quark angular momenta in the nucleon have been investigated @xcite .",
    "the present lattice investigation , a preliminary account of which was given in @xcite , is based on a mixed - action scheme developed and employed extensively by the lhp collaboration @xcite .",
    "the nucleon valence quarks as well as the strange quark fields appearing in the operator insertions in eqs .",
    "( [ matel1 ] ) and ( [ matel2 ] ) are realized as domain wall fermions , propagators of which are evaluated in the background of ( hyp - smeared ) 2 + 1-flavor dynamical asqtad quark ensembles provided by the milc collaboration .",
    "though computationally expensive , domain wall fermions lead to benign renormalization properties which prove especially advantageous in the case of the @xmath0 observable ; the substantial systematic uncertainties due to strong additive quark mass renormalizations encountered in analogous calculations using wilson fermions @xcite are avoided .",
    "the computational scheme is described in detail in section  [ schemesec ] .",
    "section  [ resultsec ] provides the raw numerical results , the renormalization of which is discussed in section  [ renormsec ] .",
    "the renormalized results are extrapolated to the physical pion mass in section  [ chisec ] , and systematic uncertainties and adjustments are considered in section  [ syssec ] , with conclusions presented in section  [ concsec ] .",
    "the lattice calculation of the nucleon matrix elements in ( [ matel1 ] ) , ( [ matel2 ] ) proceeds in standard fashion via correlator ratios of the type @xmath33 ( \\tau , t ) = \\frac{\\left\\langle \\ \\left [ \\gamma^{nuc}_{\\alpha \\beta } \\",

    "the sums over spatial position @xmath37 project the nucleon states onto zero momentum , whereas the sum over spatial position @xmath38 is simply transcribed from ( [ matel1 ] ) , ( [ matel2 ] ) . since the nucleon contains no strange valence quarks , the three - point function averaged in the numerator of ( [ corrrat ] ) factorizes , as written , into the nucleon two - point function and the strange quark loop .",
    "i.e. , only the disconnected diagram , cf .",
    "[ ddiagram ] , contributes to the matrix elements under consideration .",
    "the strange quark fields have already been reordered in the numerator of ( [ corrrat ] ) such as to make the standard minus sign associated with quark loops explicit .",
    "finally , the @xmath42 matrices allow one to choose the appropriate nucleon polarization and strange quark operator insertion structures .",
    "the denominator of ( [ corrrat ] ) corresponds to the unpolarized nucleon two - point function , obtained using @xmath43 in the numerator , for the purpose of evaluating @xmath0 , unpolarized nucleon states are appropriate , corresponding to the choice @xmath44 ; furthermore , the scalar strange quark insertion is obtained by choosing @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( \\tau , t ) \\ - \\ [ \\mbox{vev } ] \\right ) \\ \\equiv \\",

    "on the other hand , @xmath1 is obtained by using the projector onto nucleon states polarized in the positive / negative @xmath12-direction in the numerator of ( [ corrrat ] ) , @xmath48 as well as the operator insertion structure @xmath49 . averaging over positive / negative @xmath12-direction ( with a relative minus sign ) as well as the three spatial @xmath12 to improve statistics leads one to evaluate @xmath50 ( \\tau , t ) \\ \\equiv \\",

    "lastly , the prefactor @xmath52 cancels the additional factor @xmath53 which the @xmath54-matrix in the operator insertion acquires when the calculation is cast in terms of euclidean lattice correlators ; thus , the @xmath55 obtained through ( [ corrds ] ) is already wick - rotated back to minkowski space - time . note that ( [ corrds ] ) does not call for the subtraction of a vacuum expectation value , since the latter vanishes in the ensemble average . in practice",
    ", this numerical zero was nevertheless subtracted from ( [ corrds ] ) in order to reduce statistical fluctuations .      the averages in the correlator ratios ( [ corrrat ] ) were carried out using the three milc @xmath56-flavor dynamical asqtad quark ensembles listed in table  [ tabmilc ] .",

    "fitting parabolae to the data in table  [ mrestab ] yields the following derivatives at the @xmath61-flavor symmetric point @xmath62 and at the lightest @xmath63 considered in this work , @xmath64 : @xmath65 the simplest estimate for @xmath66 from this can be obtained by noting that , at the @xmath61-flavor symmetric point , @xmath67 ( where the factor 1/2 stems from the fact that @xmath68 ) . assuming that the derivative of @xmath69 in the @xmath70-direction varies only weakly as one changes @xmath63 , one arrives at the estimate that also @xmath71 note that this is most likely an upper bound in magnitude , since one would expect the characteristics of the gauge fields entering the dirac operator to be dominated by the light quark degrees of freedom relative to the strange quark degrees of freedom as @xmath63 becomes smaller .",
    "a check on this estimate can be constructed by the following alternative chain of reasoning .",
    "first , note that the quantity @xmath72 contains two contributions , namely , one from the explicit variation of @xmath63 in the dirac operator which @xmath69 characterizes , and the other from the implicit dependence of the gauge field ensemble on @xmath63 . to estimate",
    "@xmath73 , one therefore needs to apply two correction factors to @xmath72 : a factor characterizing the proportion of the variation of @xmath69 due specifically to the implicit variation of the gauge fields , and a factor characterizing the strength of that variation with @xmath70 as opposed to @xmath63 .",
    "the order of magnitude of these correction factors can be inferred as follows .",
    "the former factor is available at the @xmath61-flavor symmetric point as the ratio @xmath74 for the purposes of the present argument , it will be assumed that this factor only varies mildly as @xmath75 is lowered to @xmath76 . on the other hand ,",
    "assume also that @xmath77 i.e. , the implicit variation of @xmath78 via the dependence of the gauge fields on @xmath70 changes only mildly as a function of @xmath63 .",
    "note that , while this assumption is analogous to the one leading to ( [ simpest ] ) , it is better founded since @xmath78 itself varies less with @xmath63 than @xmath69 .",
    "again , one would expect the left - hand side to represent an upper bound for the right - hand side .",
    "noting that the left - hand side is identical to one - half the quantities in the left - hand identity in ( [ slderivs ] ) , one thus has @xmath79 where in the final step it is assumed that changes in the numerator and denominator due to changing the quark mass in the dirac operator from @xmath70 to @xmath63 approximately cancel ) and ( [ sverslvar ] ) to differ by somewhat less than a factor of two , by comparing the right - hand identity in ( [ slderivs ] ) with the right - hand identity in ( [ llderivs ] ) , corrected by the factor ( [ implicvsfull ] ) . ] .",
    "this is the desired conversion factor characterizing the strength of the implicit variation of @xmath69 with @xmath70 relative to the one with @xmath63 .",
    "correcting , as proposed above , @xmath72 by the two factors ( [ implicvsfull ] ) and ( [ sverslvar ] ) , one finally arrives at the alternative estimate @xmath80 consistent in order of magnitude with ( [ simpest ] ) , especially in view of the latter being expected to represent an overestimate .",
    "the estimate ( [ simpest ] ) for @xmath66 at the lowest light quark mass considered in the numerical calculations in this work is used in section  [ scalrensec ] to constrain the influence of operator mixing effects in the renormalization of @xmath0 .",

    "<S> contributions of strange quarks to the mass and spin of the nucleon , characterized by the observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , are investigated within lattice qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation employs a 2 + 1-flavor mixed - action lattice scheme , thus treating the strange quark degrees of freedom in dynamical fashion . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are obtained at three pion masses , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , renormalized , and chirally extrapolated to the physical pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> the value extracted for @xmath1 at the physical pion mass in the @xmath5 scheme at a scale of @xmath6 is @xmath7 , whereas the strange quark contribution to the nucleon mass amounts to @xmath8 . in the employed mixed - action scheme , </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon valence quarks as well as the strange quarks entering the nucleon matrix elements which determine @xmath0 and @xmath1 are realized as domain wall fermions , propagators of which are evaluated in milc 2 + 1-flavor dynamical asqtad quark ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> the use of domain wall fermions leads to mild renormalization behavior which proves especially advantageous in the extraction of @xmath0 .    </S>",
