    "a neural network ( nn ) is a mathematical or computational model inspired by biological neural networks that consists of interconnected groups of neurons . without chaotic behavior neural systems",
    "can not be adequately addressed and fully understood @xcite .",
    "neurobiological chaos , omnipresent in the brain , points out several possible approaches of understanding how the brain works and this is demonstrably so , in the somatosensory and the olfactory cortices @xcite .",
    "many nns , such as discrete time nns , or continuous ( time - delayed ) nns , may behave chaotically .",
    "the roles of chaos in this type of systems have been investigated in many papers in the last years @xcite .",
    "hopfield neural networks ( hnn ) are constructed from artificial neurons and represent particular cases of nns inspired by spin systems . even if it is not easy to be discovered ,",
    "chaos and hyperchaos have been identified in many hnns @xcite .    on the other side , the origin of transient chaos",
    "is well known : it is due to nonattracting chaotic saddles in phase space @xcite .",
    "transient chaos is a common phenomenon of many engineering , physical and biological systems .",
    "compared with chaos , which is characterized as a long - term behavior , the transient chaos , is a phenomenon which appears when a nonlinear system behaves chaotically during some transient time interval which falls after that into a periodic attractor .",
    "these systems may initially exhibit an aperiodic behavior and sensitivity to initial conditions ( i.e. `` chaos '' ) and after a period of time , it settles down on a periodic orbit or fixed point .",
    "such phenomena were observed in radio circuits @xcite , hydrodynamics @xcite , neural networks @xcite , standard models of nonlinear systems such as rssler system @xcite , lorenz system @xcite , experiments @xcite , maps @xcite , species extinction @xcite and so on .    in some applications",
    "the transient chaos can be quite disastrous , as in situations of voltage collapse or species extinction .",
    "therefore it is often desirable to sustain transient chaos , in the sense of maintaining the transient chaos .",
    "thus , conversion of the transient chaos into sustained chaos , can avoid catastrophes related to sudden chaos collapses , even in the absence of external perturbations .",
    "( i.e. chaos anticontrol ) @xcite .    in a recent paper",
    "@xcite a new phenomenon of transient chaos , fundamentally different from the hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic transient chaos reported in the existing literature is revealed .",
    "this type of phenomenon appears in many systems ( chemical reactions , binary star behavior , etc . ) and it is likely far less predictable than has been previously thought : _ doubly transient chaos_.    from the computational perspective point of view , based on the connection of their basins of attraction with equilibria in the phase space , it is natural to suggest the following attractors classification @xcite    [ def ] an attractor is called a _ self - excited attractor _ if its basin of attraction intersects with any open neighborhood of a stationary state ( an equilibrium ) ; otherwise , it is called a _",
    "hidden attractor_.    self - excited attractors can be visualized numerically by a standard computational procedure , in which after a transient process , a trajectory starting from a point of a neighborhood of unstable equilibrium is attracted to the attractor , while the basin of attraction for a hidden attractor is not connected with any equilibrium .",
    "therefore , for the numerical localization of hidden attractors it is necessary to develop special analytical - numerical procedures @xcite .",
    "hidden attractors can appear in systems with no - equilibria or in multistable systems with only stable equilibrium .",
    "coexisting self - excited attractors in multistable systems can be found using a standard computational procedure , whereas there is no regular way to predict the existence or coexistence of hidden attractors in a system ( for various examples of multistable engineering systems refer to @xcite ) .    to verify numerically that a chaotic attractor is hidden , one has to check that all trajectories starting in small neighborhoods of unstable equilibria , are either attracted by stable attractors , or diverge to infinity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider the case of a @xmath0-neuron simplified hnn and we unveil its transient hidden chaotic attractors .",
    "the simplified @xmath0-neuron hnn considered in this paper is modeled by the following odes    @xmath1    with @xmath2 and with the weight matrix @xcite    @xmath3    and we show numerically that the system admits a new type of coexisting hidden attractors : _ _ transient hidden attractors__.    with the above values of weights , the system ( [ eq ] ) reads @xmath4    the sigmoid - like function @xmath5 , is used to approximate the switch discontinuity in @xmath6 , typically to neurons dynamics .",
    "the hnn system ( [ eq2 ] ) is symmetrical with respect to the origin and has the following equilibria    @xmath7    the jacobian is @xmath8    and the eigenvalues of @xmath9 are @xmath10 and @xmath11 while the eigenvalues of @xmath12 are @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , equilibria are unstable : one attracting focus saddle ( @xmath9 ) , and two repelling focus saddles ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the numerical integration of the hnn ( [ eq2 ] ) is done with the matlab differential solver @xmath15 with option @xmath16 which yields @xmath17 decimals accurate results , over the time interval @xmath18 $ ] with @xmath19 . and @xmath20 and the approximate error at each step @xmath21 is ensured to be : @xmath22 , for all @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the value calculated at the node @xmath25 ( see e.g. @xcite for the used runge - kutta and other numerical methods utilized by matlab ) . in @xcite it is suggested @xmath26 for @xmath27 precise digits of the required solution . ]    in hopfield like systems it is common to find transient chaos ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "generally , the duration of a chaotic transient behavior of many trajectories is rather short before they settle down on some periodic stable attractor @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of the hnn , our various numerical tests reveal a relative long transient time @xmath28 $ ] , with @xmath29 , over which the system behaves chaotically along two coexisting transient chaotic attractors @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( see fig.[fig3 ] where @xmath32 are obtained with initial conditions @xmath33 ) .    for the initial conditions chosen inside small @xmath34-vicinities of the unstable equilibria , with @xmath35 ,",
    "the underlying trajectories are attracted by one of the two stable limit cycles @xmath36 ( red plot ) and @xmath37 ( blue plot ) respectively as shown by figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] where , for simplicity , in the detailed images only 50 trajectories are considered .",
    "trajectories starting from a @xmath34-vicinity @xmath38 of @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , tend either to @xmath36 ( light red plot ) , or to @xmath37 ( light blue plot ) .",
    "this happens because @xmath9 belongs to the separatrix of the basins of attractions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where only the case of stable limit cycle @xmath37 is considered , reveals 50 trajectories starting inside a vicinity @xmath39 of equilibrium @xmath40 , which all are attracted by the stable cycle @xmath37 .",
    "similarly , all trajectories from small vicinities of @xmath41 are attracted by @xmath36 .",
    "the shape of the trajectories starting within @xmath38 and @xmath42 are consistent with the equilibria type : the trajectories from vicinities @xmath42 exit by scrolling equilibria @xmath43 in the unstable two - dimensional manifold ( see detailed image in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , while the trajectories from the vicinity of @xmath9 leave @xmath38 along the one - dimensional unstable manifold of @xmath9 ( detail in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "concluding , by following intensive numerical tests , the underlying numerical analysis leads to the conclusion that the transient chaotic attractors @xmath32 , are very likely to be hidden and could be called _ transient hidden chaotic attractors_. for the numerical localization of hidden attractors , a special analytical - numerical procedure has been designed ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper the initial conditions for transient hidden attractors @xmath33 , have been found by trial - and - error .",
    "note that the coexistence of transient trajectories which start from @xmath38 and @xmath42 and reach the stable cycles @xmath44 with the stable cycles @xmath44 , are ensured by the entrainment of limit cycles by chaos ( see @xcite , where the replication of sensitivity and the existence of infinitely many unstable periodic solutions were rigorously proved and @xcite , where this result is applied in hopfield systems ) .",
    "based on this result , the transient hidden chaotic attractors @xmath45 differ from the transients to @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , they have different attraction basins : @xmath32 are generated starting from initial conditions @xmath33 , while @xmath44 are obtained with initial points close to equilibria @xmath9 and @xmath12 . for @xmath46 , @xmath47 vanish .",
    "the transients of the hnn system seems to be deformed by the form of the coexisting limit cycles and unstable equilibria , thus @xmath30 and @xmath31 have a complex structure .",
    "so one may say that the behavior is rather natural here .",
    "since chaotic behavior in neural activity seems to be unavoidable , chaos control and anticontrol of these transient hidden chaotic attractors are an unexplored theme yet and they offer an exciting subject for future research .",
