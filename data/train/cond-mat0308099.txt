    "@xcite if a given hamiltonian is integrable by the bethe ansatz , the level - spacing distribution should be described by the poisson distribution : @xmath0 if it is not integrable , the level - spacing distribution should be given by the wigner distribution : @xmath1 these behaviors of the level - spacing distribution have been observed in one - dimensional ( 1d),@xcite 2d,@xcite and 3d@xcite spin systems .",
    "they are also confirmed for strongly correlated systems,@xcite and applied to the recent study of quantum dots . @xcite    the numerical observations @xcite are important .",
    "in fact , for the quantum spin systems , there has been no theoretical or analytical derivation of the suggested behaviors of the level - spacing distribution .",
    "random matrix theories do not necessarily extend to them .",
    "however , it seems that no counterexample has been shown explicitly for quantum spin systems .",
    "the suggested behaviors have been numerically confirmed for quite a large number of quantum spin systems and statistical lattice systems .",
    "@xcite moreover , the behaviors are often considered as empirical rules , by which we can practically determine whether a given lattice system is integrable or not @xcite .",
    "thus , it could be nontrivial if one would find such a quantum spin system that does not show the standard behaviors of the level - spacing distribution .",
    "recently , it has been found that an extraordinary symmetry appears for special cases of the integrable _ xxz _ spin chain : the _ xxz _ hamiltonian commutes with the @xmath2 loop algebra at some particular values of the _ xxz _ coupling associated with roots of unity .",
    "@xcite the loop algebra is an infinite - dimensional lie algebra , which holds only at the particular values of the _ xxz _ coupling and not for generic values .",
    "it is suggested numerically @xcite that the standard bethe ansatz does not hold for the special cases .",
    "furthermore , the dimensions of degenerate eigenspaces of the loop algebra are given by some exponential functions of the system size , @xcite and they can be extremely large",
    ". it should therefore be nontrivial how the large degeneracies are resolved by nonintegrable perturbative terms in the spin hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 loop algebra symmetry may motivate us to reconsider not only the bethe ansatz solvability of the integrable _ xxz _ chain but also the standard statistical behaviors of energy levels for various _ xxz _ chains close to the integrable one .",
    "we note that some level crossings of the @xmath2 loop algebra are shown in fig .  1 of ref .  .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss level - spacing distributions for the spin @xmath3 _ xxz _ chains on finite sites under periodic boundary conditions .",

    "we first confirm that integrable spin chains show the poisson distribution for generic cases . here",
    "we exclude the special cases related to roots of unity .",
    "then , we consider the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) coupled heisenberg spin chain ( or _ xxx _ spin chain ) , which is nonintegrable .",
    "we now note that the _ xxx _ chain with nnn couplings has the wigner distribution , as shown in ref . .",
    "for the _ xxz _ spin chains with nnn couplings , however , we find that the level - spacing distributions are not given by the standard wigner distribution",
    ". the observation should be nontrivial since the systems are nonintegrable .",
    "finally , we discuss possible reasons why the non - wigner distribution is obtained for the nnn coupled _ xxz _ spin chains .",
    "the hamiltonian matrices can be separated into some sectors ; in each sector , the eigenstates have the same quantum numbers .",
    "this is because the eigenvalues with different symmetries are uncorrelated .",
    "the _ xxz _",
    "chains have three trivial symmetries , namely , reflections , translations , and spin rotations around the @xmath4 axis .",
    "therefore , to desymmetrize the hamiltonians , we consider three quantum numbers : parities , momenta , and total @xmath5 .",
    "we calculate the eigenvalues of the largest sectors .",
    "the largest sector of each hamiltonian has 440 eigenvalues for the lattice size @xmath6 . to calculate the eigenvalues",

    ", one has to deal with unfolded eigenvalues instead of raw eigenvalues .",
    "the unfolded eigenvalues are renormalized values , whose local density of states is equal to unity everywhere in the spectrum . in this paper , the unfolded eigenvalues @xmath7 are obtained from the raw eigenvalues @xmath8 in the following method .",
