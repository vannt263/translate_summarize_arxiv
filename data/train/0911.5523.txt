    "in contrast , because of the longer lifetime of synchrotron radiation at cm wavelengths @xcite , such emission is more spread out along the pc scale of the jets up to distances @xmath28milli - arcseconds @xcite . moreover , owing to synchrotron opacity , the bright cm wavelength emission from compact cores in agn lies in regions farther downstream in the jet than at mm wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "thus , although this does not allow us to claim completeness of our sample to the 1jy total flux density limit , the relatively small fraction of missing sources , together with the unprecedented large size of our 86 ghz polarization sample , allows us to rely on the results derived from it as long as subsample selection does not lead to unacceptably small number statistics , which is not the case for any of our subsamples ( see below ) .    in a survey like ours ,",
    "polarization non - detection is a relevant bias that may be introduced by source variability when the total flux density of a considerable fraction of the sample decreases .",

    "we note , though , that our 86ghz observations were not performed contemporaneously with the _ _ f__ermi - lat @xmath11-ray observations by @xcite , and the luminosity distributions of lbas and non  lbas sources presented here ( specially for bl  lacs ) may appear broader by 3 mm source variability , thus hiding actual trends ( see   [ var ] ) .      the spectral index between two observing frequencies ( @xmath97 ) in the radio  mm spectral range provides information about the synchrotron opacity between such observing frequencies ( @xmath98 ) affecting the radiation from an emitting jet region .",
    "for the 15ghz and 86ghz emission in radio loud agn , the emitting regions are not co - spatial in general ( see section  [ intr ] ) .",
    "hence , for most sources , the @xmath99 determination is biased towards larger ( more optically thick ) spectral indices .",

    ", we performed an @xmath99 study of our main subsamples _ only _ to study the relative differences among them .",
    "for this , we used only those sources in our sample with available 15ghz total flux densities from integrated intensities of mojave vlba images . to try to avoid biasing the computation of @xmath99 owing to source variability , we selected , for each source , the mojave observation closest in time to our 86ghz measurement .    the @xmath99 distributions for each one of the source samples considered in this paper",

    "if either the magnetic field is not homogeneously distributed along the jet or the jet has prominent non - axysimmetry , lower polarization degree is expected from sources better oriented to the line of sight ( i.e. , quasars ) owing to cancellation of orthogonal polarization components .",
