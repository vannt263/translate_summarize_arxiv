    "( pat ) is a medical imaging technique that combines electromagnetic excitation ( in the visible spectrum ) with ultrasound measurements . in a photoacoustic experiment ,",
    "a translucent sample is illuminated by a laser pulse with wavelength @xmath5 ( which we assume to be fixed in this article ) .",
    "the absorbed optical energy leads to thermal expansion , generating an ultrasound pressure wave @xmath6 that can be measured outside the sample .    since the pulses used in pat are very short , the complete energy is deposited almost instantaneously compared to travel times of acoustic waves , and the pressure wave @xmath7 can be assumed to have been generated by an _ initial pressure _ @xmath8 , that is , it satisfies the wave equation @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes a _ measurement surface _",
    ", can be obtained from ultrasound measurements @xcite .    by solving an _ inverse problem for the wave equation _",
    "( see , e.g , @xcite for a review of inversion techniques ) , these ultrasound measurements can be used to estimate the _ initial pressure _ @xmath8 . since @xmath12 that is",
    ", @xmath8 is proportional to the _ absorbed energy _",
    "@xmath13 , which is in turn proportional to the _ optical absorption coefficient _",
    "@xmath14 at the applied wavelength @xmath5 and the local fluence @xmath15 ( the time - integrated laser power received at @xmath16 ) , the initial pressure visualizes contrast in @xmath17 .",
    "the constant of proportionality @xmath18 is called _ grneisen coefficient _ ( or _ pa efficiency _ since it describes the efficiency of conversion from absorbed energy to acoustic signal ) @xcite .    in _ quantitative photoacoustic tomography _ ( qpat ) , the goal is to apply pat to determine ( inhomogeneous ) optical material properties of the sample ( which are of diagnostic interest ) . to do so , an additional non - linear _ inverse problem for light transport _ has to be solved , since the fluence @xmath15 is inhomogeneous and itself dependent on the optical properties of the sample @xcite .",
    "while it is also possible to attack the acoustic and optical inverse problems simultaneously ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , here , we assume that the acoustic part of the problem has been solved successfully , i.e. , that ( possibly noisy ) data @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 signifying the noise level ) are available .    in this article , we utilize the _ diffusion approximation _ ( which is valid in highly scattering media @xcite ) of the _ radiative transfer equation _ to model the fluence distribution .",
    "it is , however , also possible to use a radiative transfer model for qpat ( see @xcite ) , albeit at the cost of increased computational and analytical complexity .    the diffusion model ( in a lipschitz domain @xmath21 ) is given by @xmath22",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is called _",
    "diffusion coefficient_. the dirichlet boundary data @xmath24 ( which we assume to be continuous and known in this article ) describes the illumination pattern .",
    "note that this is a time - independent model , again due to the fact that energy is deposited almost instantaneously compared to time scales of the acoustic system .",
    "the difficulty of the inverse problem varies depending on which parameters of the model are assumed to be known .",
    "we present three inverse problems often considered in the literature .",
    "the hardest one is : @xmath25    bal and ren showed in @xcite that for arbitrary coefficients @xmath26 , this problem is unsolvable , even if multiple measurements of @xmath27 ( with different known boundary illumination patterns @xmath24 ) are available .    in @xcite , the authors showed that with a restriction to _ piecewise constant parameters _",
    ", unique reconstruction of all three unknown parameters @xmath28 from multiple measurements is possible ( under a condition on the directions of @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the fluence of the @xmath31th illumination pattern ) .",
    "furthermore , an analytical reconstruction procedure was suggested and implemented numerically , which , unfortunately , is relatively sensitive to noise .",
    "alberti and ammari @xcite also established a unique reconstruction result , based on _ morphological component analysis _ ( a sparsity approach ) , in a slightly more general setting ( which assumes different degrees of smoothness of the coefficients and the fluence ) .",
    "they also provide numerical reconstructions , which were , however , not tested for noise sensitivity in the case of .    to simplify the problem , it is often assumed that the grneisen coefficient @xmath32 is known or constant , which implies that the absorbed energy can be estimated with @xmath33 ( with @xmath20 again denoting the noise level ) .",
    "it remains to solve @xmath34 if only a single measurement of @xmath35 is given , this inverse problem is also ill - posed ( since it has infinitely many solutions pairs , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , in @xcite , the authors were able to recover @xmath17 ( independently of the light transfer model used ) from a single measurement of @xmath36 ( again using a _ sparsity method _ , assuming different degrees of smoothness of the coefficients and the fluence ) .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that this problem is uniquely solvable if two measurements of @xmath36 ( corresponding to well - chosen boundary illuminations @xmath37 ) are available .",
    "numerically , this multi - illumination case was treated in @xcite , using a multitude of different techniques , see also the review paper by cox et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the simplest case works under the assumption that the diffusion coefficient @xmath23 is also known : @xmath38 this inverse problem has a unique solution even for a single measurement , which can be seen by substituting @xmath39 in , providing the possibility to solve for @xmath40 @xcite . for other ( numerical ) approaches , cf . @xcite . to the authors knowledge , this simplified problem is the only case for which practical viability ( with experimental data ) has been established both for phantoms @xcite and biological samples @xcite .      in this article ,",
    "we consider the problem using a _ single measurement _ for our reconstructions , a problem that is in general ill - posed .",
    "similar to @xcite ( which treats with multiple measurements ) , a restriction to piecewise constant @xmath4 also proves to be useful for this problem .",
    "in fact , as shown in section [ sec : recovery_pw_const ] , when the parameters @xmath4 are piecewise constant functions ( and noise - free data are given ) , the inverse problem can be solved uniquely , without any further assumptions .    in section",
    "[ sec : mumford_shah_parameter_detection ] , we present a variational model for the reconstruction of piecewise constant @xmath4 from noisy data @xmath35 based on the _ ambrosio - tortorelli approximation _ of a _ mumford - shah - like functional_. compared to the two - step reconstruction process presented in @xcite ( which was introduced for , but is applicable for ) , which first detects the regions where the parameters are constant , then reconstructs the parameter values from jumps of the data and its derivatives , this variational approach is much more robust with respect to noise .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the numerical approach presented in @xcite requires almost perfect jump detection in the second derivatives of @xmath35 to get reasonable estimates of @xmath4 ( since the jumps have to form a full partition of the domain @xmath41 ) , which is highly challenging in the presence of significant amounts of noise .",
    "this is not the case for the variational method presented here .",
    "finally , a description of our implementation and numerical results can be found in section [ sec : numerical_results ] .",
    "in this section we show that piecewise constant parameters @xmath4 can be recovered uniquely from a single measurement of the absorbed energy @xmath42 .    in the following ,",
    "let @xmath43 be a partition of @xmath21 into open sets and @xmath4 piecewise constant on @xmath43 , that is , for @xmath44 open and @xmath45 @xmath46 furthermore , for @xmath47 , denote by @xmath48 the discontinuities of a function @xmath49 and its derivatives up to @xmath31-th order .",

    "however , such an approach is infeasible , since it requires the detection of jumps of derivatives up to second order of the data @xmath35 .",
    "in particular , jumps may remain partially undetected ( e.g. , if the edge detection has to be restricted to first derivatives due to noise , see remark [ rem : edges_first_order ] and the numerical examples in section [ sec : numerical_results ] ) , leading to an incomplete estimated partition and therefore highly erroneous parameter estimates .    to overcome this problem",
    ", we propose a variational approach favouring piecewise constant solutions that estimates the numerical values of piecewise constant @xmath4 and their jumps at the same time .",

    "for instance , a popular class of methods is based on the _ level set method _",
    "@xcite or variations of it , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this approach has been suggested for qpat ( using the radiative transfer model ) in @xcite , however , it was only tested using multiple measurements . in this article",
    ", we use an _ ambrosio - tortorelli _ approximation of a _",
    "mumford - shah - like _ functional ( which was first suggested for _ electrical impedance tomography _ in @xcite ) .",
    "the main advantage of this approximation is that we can utilize incomplete jump information ( obtained , for instance , from jumps of the data or other means ) to initialize the minimization procedure ( see section [ sec : mumford_shah_minimization ] ) .",
    "numerically , leads to faster convergence ( and in some cases improved minimizers ) .",
    "additionally , the number of segments does not have to be known in advance ( in contrast to _ multiple level set methods _ ) and the minimization with respect to the jump indicator functions is a simple elliptic problem .",
    "we want to minimize the mumford - shah - like functional @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the @xmath110-dimensional hausdorff - measure and @xmath42 the operator that maps the ( unknown ) parameters @xmath4 to the measurements @xmath36 satisfying , .",
    "the minimum is taken over all @xmath4 in suitable ( that is , point - wise bounded from below and above ) subsets of @xmath111 and all closed sets @xmath112 ( the jump sets of the coefficients @xmath4 ) .",
    "functionals of this type , first introduced by mumford and shah for image denoising and segmentation in @xcite , have been applied for a wide range of inverse problems , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea behind the functional is as follows .",
    "the _ discrepancy term _ @xmath113 forces minimizing coefficients @xmath114 to be close ( in @xmath115-sense ) to a solution of the inverse problem @xmath116 ( of which there are infinitely many ) , while the _ regularization terms _ @xmath117 force both the variation of @xmath114 ( outside their jump sets @xmath118 ) as well as the hyper - surface area of @xmath118 to be small .",
    "the regularization parameters @xmath119 control the amount of continuous variation the parameters may have , whereas @xmath120 control the complexity of the coefficient s jump sets @xmath121 .",
