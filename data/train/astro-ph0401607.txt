    "relativistic iron line profiles may provide a powerful tool to measure the mass of the black hole in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and galactic black hole candidates . to this aim , stella ( 1990 ) proposed to use temporal changes in the line profile following variations of the illuminating primary source ( which at that time was assumed to be located on the disc axis for simplicity ) .",
    "along the same line of thought , matt & perola ( 1992 ) proposed to employ , instead , variations of the integrated line properties such as equivalent width , centroid energy and line width .",
    "these methods are very similar conceptually to the classical reverberation mapping method , widely and successfully applied to optical broad lines in agns .",
    "sufficiently long monitoring of the continuum and of the line emission is required , as well as large enough signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "however , the above - mentioned methods have not provided many results yet . even in the best studied case of the seyfert galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 ,",
    "the mass estimate is hard to obtain due to the apparent lack of correlation between the line and continuum emission ( fabian et al .",
    "it was suggested that also these complications are possibly caused by an interplay of complex general relativistic effects ( miniutti et al .",
    "x - ray spectra from high throughput and high energy resolution detectors should resolve the problem of interpretation of observed spectral features . however , before such high quality data are available it is desirable to examine existing spectra and attempt to constrain physical parameters of the models .",
    "a simple , direct and potentially robust way to measure the black hole mass would be available if the line emission originates at a given radius and azimuth , as expected if the disc illumination is provided by a localized flare just above the disc ( possibly due to magnetic reconnection ) , rather than a central illuminator or an extended corona .",
    "if a resulting ` hot spot ' co - rotates with the disc and lives for at least a significant part of an orbit , by fitting the light curve and centroid energy of the line flux , the inclination angle @xmath0 and the orbit radius could be derived ( radius in units of the gravitational radius @xmath1 ) .",
    "further , assuming keplerian rotation , the orbital period is linked with radius in a well - known manner .",
    "the equation for the orbital period then contains the black hole mass @xmath2 explicitely , and so this parameter can be determined , as discussed later .",
    "hot spots in agn accretion discs were popular for a while , following the finding of apparent periodicity in the x - ray emission of the seyfert  1 galaxy ngc  6814 .",
    "they , however , were largely abandoned when this periodicity was demonstrated to be associated with an am  herculis system in the field of view rather than the agn itself ( madejski et al . 1993 ) .",
    "periodicities in agns were subsequently reported in a few sources ( iwasawa et al .",
    "1998 ; lee et al .",
    "2000 ; boller et al .",
    "the fact that they were not confirmed in different observations of the same sources is not surprising ",
    "quite on the contrary , it would be hard to imagine a hot spot surviving for several years .",

    "2002 , 2004 ; guainazzi 2003 ; yaqoob et al .",
    "2003 ) has renewed interest in hot spots .",
    "there is a tentative explanation ( even if not the only one ) for these features , typically observed in the @xmath3@xmath4  kev energy range , in terms of iron emission produced in a small range of radii and distorted by joint action of doppler and gravitational shift of photon energy .",
    "iron lines would be produced by localized flares which illuminate the underlying disc surface , producing the line by fluorescence .",
    "indeed , the formation of magnetic flares on the disc surface is one of the most promising scenarios for the x - ray emission of agns",
    ". a particularly strong flare , or one with a very large anisotropic emission towards the disc , could give rise to the observed features .",
    "small width of the observed spectral features implies that the emitting region must be small , and that it is seen for only a fraction of the entire orbit ( either because the flare dies out , or because emission goes below detectability , see next section ) . if the flares co - rotate with the disc and if they last for a significant part of the orbit , it may be possible by observing their flux and energy variations with phase to determine the orbital parameters , and thence @xmath2 .    in section 2",

    "2000 for recent reviews ) .",
    "let us here briefly summarize several formulae most relevant to our purposes .",
    "if @xmath5 is the orbital radius and @xmath6 is the dimension - less black hole angular momentum , the orbital period of matter co - rotating along a circular trajectory @xmath7 around the black hole is given by ( bardeen , press & teukolsky 1972 ) @xmath8 } , \\label{torb}\\ ] ] as measured by a distant observer .",
    "we express lengths in units of the gravitational radius @xmath9  cm , where @xmath10 is the mass of the black hole in units of @xmath11 solar masses .",
    "angular momentum @xmath6 ( per unit mass ) is in geometrized units ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "see e.g. misner , thorne & wheeler ( 1973 ) for useful conversion formulae between geometrized and physical units .",
    "the innermost stable orbit , @xmath13 , occurs for an equatorial disc at radius @xmath14^{1 \\over 2 } , \\label{velocity1}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 ; @xmath13 spans the range of radii from @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , i.e. the case of a maximally rotating black hole ) to @xmath4 ( @xmath19 , a static black hole ) .",
    "rotation of a black hole is believed to be limited by an equilibrium value @xmath20 because of the capture of photons from the disc ( thorne 1974 ) .",
    "this would imply @xmath21 .",
    "different models of accretion can result in somewhat different limiting values of @xmath6 and the corresponding @xmath22 .",
    "notice that in the static case , the radial dependence @xmath23 is identical to that in purely newtonian gravity .    in order to compute a synthetic profile of an observed spectral line one has to link the points of emission in the disc with corresponding pixels in the detector plane at spatial infinity .",
    "this can be achieved by solving the ray - tracing problem in curved space - time of the black hole .",
    "appropriate methods were discussed by several authors ; see reynolds & nowak ( 2003 ) for a recent review and for further references .",
    "this way one finds the redshift factor , which determines the energy shift of photons , the lensing effect ( i.e. the change of solid angle due to strong gravity ) , and the effect of aberration ( which influences the emission direction of photons from the disc ; this must be taken into account if the intrinsic emissivity is non - isotropic ) .",
    "we consider these effects in our computations , assuming a rotating ( kerr ) black hole spacetime ( misner et al . 1973 ) .",
    "we also consider time of arrival of photons originating at different regions of the disc plane .",
    "variable travel time results in mutual time delay between different photons , which can be ignored when analyzing time - averaged data but it may be important for time - resolved data .",
    "assuming purely azimuthal keplerian motion of a spot , one obtains for its orbital velocity ( with respect to a locally non - rotating observer at corresponding radius @xmath5 ) : @xmath24 in order to derive time and frequency as measured by a distant observer , one needs to take into account the lorentz factor associated with this orbital motion , @xmath25 corresponding angular velocity of orbital motion is @xmath26 , which also determines the orbital period in eq .",
    "( [ torb ] ) .",
    "the redshift factor @xmath27 and the emission angle @xmath28 ( with respect to the normal direction to the disc ) are then given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 ; @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constants of motion connected with the photon ray in an axially symmetric and stationary spacetime",
    ".    for practical purposes formula ( [ torb ] ) with @xmath19 is accurate enough also in the case of a spinning black hole , provided that @xmath5 is not very small .",
    "for instance , even for @xmath34 ( the last stable orbit in schwarzschild metric ) , @xmath35 calculated for a static and for a maximally rotating ( @xmath18 ) black hole differ by about @xmath36% .",
    "the relative difference decreases , roughly linearly , down to @xmath37% at @xmath38 .",
    "this implies that eq .",
    "( [ torb ] ) can be used in most cases to estimate the black hole mass even if the angular momentum is not known ( deviations are relevant only for @xmath39 , when the radius itself can be used to constrain the allowed range of @xmath6 ) .    various pseudo - newtonian formulae have been devised for accreting black holes to model their observational properties , which are connected with the orbital motion of surrounding matter ( e.g. abramowicz et al .",
    "1996 ; artemova , bjrnsson & novikov 1996 ; semerk & karas 1999 ) .",
    "although this approach is often used and found to be practical , we do not employ it here because error estimates are not possible within the pseudo - newtonian scheme .",
    "due to doppler and gravitational energy shift the line shape changes along the orbit .",
    "centroid energy is redshifted with respect to the rest energy of the line emission for most of the orbit .",
    "furthermore , light aberration and bending cause the flux to be strongly phase  dependent .",
    "these effects are shown in figures [ orbits_1][orbits_2 ] . in these plots",
    ", the arrival time of photons is defined in orbital periods , i.e.  scaled with @xmath40 .",
    "the orbital phase of the spot is of course linked with the azimuthal angle in the disc , but the relation is made complex by time delays which can not be neglected , given the large velocities of the orbiting matter and frame - dragging effects near the black hole . here",
    ", zero time corresponds to the moment when the center of the spot was at the nearest point on its orbit with respect to the observer ( a lower conjunction ) .",

    "worth remarking is a large difference in the orbital phase of maximum emission between the extreme case , @xmath44 , in contrast to the non - rotating case , @xmath45 .",
    "the reason is that for large @xmath6 the time delay and the effect of frame - dragging on photons emitted behind the black hole are very substantial .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , for very high inclination angles , most of the flux comes from the far side of the disc , due to very strong light bending , as pointed out by matt et al .",

    "as said above , at these radii differences between spinning and static black holes are small .",
    "indeed , it can be verified that the dependence on @xmath6 is only marginal if @xmath49 , and so it can be largely neglected for present - day measurements .    in figures  [ prof_phi_1][prof_phi_2 ]",

    "the entire revolution was split into twelve different phase intervals .",
    "the intrinsic flux @xmath50 is assumed to decrease exponentially with the distance @xmath51 from the centre of the spot ( i.e. @xmath52 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath5 is the location of the spot centre and @xmath53 is a constant ) .",
    "the illumination is supposed to cease at distance @xmath51 away from the spot centre , which also defines the illuminated area in the disc .",
    "let us remark that we concentrate on a spectral line which is intrinsically narrow and unresolved in the rest frame of the emitting medium .",
    "such a line can be produced by a spot which originates due to sharply localized illumination by flares , as proposed and discussed by various authors ( e.g. haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ; poutanen & fabian 1999 ; merloni & fabian 2001 ) .    very recently , czerny et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have examined the induced rms variability in the flare / spot model with relativistic effects . in this scheme ,",
    "the actual size of the spot is linked with the x - ray flux , which is produced in the flare , and with the vertical height at which the flare occurs above the disc plane .",
    "these quantities are obviously model - dependent .",
    "czerny et al . ( 2004 ) computations provided different cases with the spot size ranging from a fraction of @xmath1 to several units of @xmath1 .",
    "our computations can also simulate the observed features with the spot size as a free parameter , but with present data we can not constrain this parameter with sufficient accuracy . obviously , the idea of narrow spectral features favours small size of the spot , as large spots would produce broader features and they would be more prone to rapid destruction . hence , we fix the spot size somewhat arbitrarily at a lower boundary , @xmath54 .    in many cases , and especially for small radii and intermediate to large inclination angles ,",
    "the line emission comes from a relatively minor fraction of the orbit .",
    "this implies in practice that for observations with a _ moderate signal - to - noise ratios , only a narrow blue horn can be visible , and only for a small part of the orbit . _",
    "these large and rapid changes of the line shape get averaged when integrating over the entire orbit , and so an important piece of information is missing in the mean spectra .",
    "the line profiles integrated over the whole revolution are shown in figure  [ profiles ] .",
    "effectively , the mean profile of a spot is identical to the profile of an annulus whose radius is equal to the distance of the spot centre and the width is equal to the spot size .         +",
    "recently , interesting narrow emission features have been discovered in several agns .",
    "they occur in x - ray spectra , mostly ( but not exclusively ) at energies lower than @xmath55  kev , which is the intrinsic energy of the neutral iron k@xmath56 fluorescent line in a frame co - moving with the emitting medium .",
    "the sources are : ngc  3516 ( turner et al .",
    "2002 ) , eso  198-g024 ( guainazzi 2003 ) , ngc  7314 ( yaqoob et al .",
    "2003 ) , and mrk  766 ( turner et al . 2004 ) .",
    "possible interpretations include lines from spallation products of iron ( skibo 1997 ) , and shifted iron lines . in the spallation model ,",
    "the strongest expected line ( after the iron line ) is the cr  k@xmath56 line at @xmath57  kev , the second strongest being the mn  k@xmath56 line at @xmath58  kev ( skibo 1997 ) .",
    "some of the observed features do not match these energies ( see below ) , and hence an energy shift is required .",
    "however , a @xmath55  kev line is always present , suggesting that the _ primary line is not shifted_. we therefore consider in most cases the spallation model an unlikely explanation .",
    "shift of the iron line may be due either to fast moving ejecta , or to orbiting material .",
    "quality of the present data is not good enough to discriminate between these two options . in the case of the orbiting spot model presented in this paper",
    ", narrow features should occur in spectra because the two horns are often sharp .",
    "the blue horn is expected to be brighter than the red one ( see fig .",
    "[ profiles ] ) . for insufficient signal - to - noise observations",
    ", only the blue horn may be actually visible , the remaining of the profile getting easily confused with continuum .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that this argument does not apply to the extreme case of @xmath44 , @xmath59 , where the profile is very broad and with no sharp peak at all .",
    "therefore , the observed features can not arise from a spot orbiting in the last stable orbit of a maximally rotating black hole .    in the following we will recapitulate the observational evidence for these features , and derive the system parameters in the framework of the orbiting spot scenario .",
    "for all these sources past claims of the presence of ` classical ' relativistic lines do exist , although only for ngc  3516 the evidence seems to be robust .",
    "the equivalent widths ( ew ) of the narrow features are typically of a few tens of ev . even allowing for the fact that only the blue horn is probably observed , this implies that the spot itself contributes just a moderate fraction of the total x - ray luminosity . in our estimate",
    "we assumed an isotropically illuminating flare ( for definiteness of the model ) .",
    "it is worth noting that non - isotropic illumination in the local frame co - moving with the flare is also possible , and it would influence the predicted profiles especially if they originate at small distance from the black hole . a relatively steady contribution to the signal",
    "is therefore required .",
    "detailed temporal analysis of spectral features simultaneously with the continuum fluxes would be necessary in order to accurately test the scheme .",
    "such analysis should also provide further constraints on the angular distribution of illuminating spots .",
    "this is , however , beyond the capabilities of present instruments , and therefore in the following we limit ourselves only to the discussion of spectral features .",
    "the comparison between the model and the observation will be made assuming that the emitted line has the rest - energy of @xmath55  kev , as measured in the local reference frame attached to the emitting matter .",
    "it means that iron is not ionized more than fe xvi , a plausible assumption under usual conditions in accretion discs in agns .",
    "however , significant ionization of iron can not be ruled out completely , especially below a flare , in which case the rest - energy of the line could be larger ( up to @xmath60  kev for h  like iron ) .",
    "if this is the case , the energy shift must be also larger in order to achieve the same observed energy of the spectral feature , and this implies either a smaller radius or a smaller inclination angle with respect to the neutral line .",
    "therefore , the values we will obtain for these two parameters should be considered as upper limits .",
    "this conclusion is rather straightforward but worth emphasizing : if the source inclination is estimated independently , then the adopted method can provide the _ upper value to the radius where the line emission originates_. once the spectral resolution and sensitivity of the available instruments are improved , subtle differences will be exploited and the ionization state will be determined more precisely . for instance , the neutral fluorescent line and the h  like resonant lines are actually doublets , with different energy separation , which is not true for the resonant he  like line , not mentioning the shape for the compton shoulder and the ratio between the k@xmath61 and k@xmath56 lines , which are dependent on ionization .",
    "there is thus some prospect to distinguish these cases in future .",
    "it is worth noting that the expected narrow - line variability should be associated with fluctuations of the x - ray continuum , because both spectral components have common origin in this model .",
    "indeed , power spectral analysis of accreting black - hole sources shows clear evidence for such variability on vastly different time - scales ( e.g. markowitz et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "recently , collin et al . ( 2003 ) examined theoretical spectra of the flare model , which is basically a generalization of the lamp - post scheme to the case of a large number of independent primary sources occurring off - axis , just above the disc plane .",
    "it will be interesting to explore in detail relations between continuum variability and the properties of spectral features .",
    "this is however beyond the scope of this paper , and it is deferred to a future work .",
    "we just note here that for two sources from our sample , no variations of the feature during the observations are apparent , which implies that neither variations in the continuum are expected . for the other two sources",
    "there is indeed evidence for variations in the feature flux , and so for them the relation with continuum variations will be briefly discussed in relevant sections below .",

    "the rest of the profile would be below detectability .",
    "furthermore , assuming ( as an order of magnitude estimate ) that the visibility of the profile lasts for about a quarter of the orbit ( which corresponds to roughly @xmath98  ks ) , the resulting black hole mass is @xmath118 .",
    "however , we stress again that , given the poor statistics , the above estimate should be taken more as a provisional hypothesis than as a reliable measurement .    a brief mention on the continuum variability is appropriate here . the line equivalent width for an isotropic illumination is about 150 ev ( e.g. matt et al . 1991 ) . given the observed value of ew , this means that the illuminating flare would account for about half the flux , and a @xmath7650% continuum variability would have been expected to accompany the feature variability , which instead is not observed . while stressing that the detection of the feature variability must be considered as tentative , a possible situation is that the illumination is very anisotropic and directed preferentially towards the disc ( see e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  7314 has a highly variable , broad iron line as observed by asca ( yaqoob et al .",
    "the source was then observed by the hetg onboard _",
    "chandra _ , and a narrow ( @xmath119  ev ) feature at @xmath120  kev ( @xmath121  ev ) was discovered ( yaqoob et al . 2003 ) in the low state , after dividing the observation in two parts according to the count rate , even if with a moderate significance ( @xmath122 ) only . as already noted by these authors",
    ", the narrow feature may be the blue horn from an annulus with @xmath94 at small inclination angle ( see fig .",
    "[ orbits_1 ] and fig .",
    "[ profiles ] ) .",
    "another feature was also detected at @xmath123  kev ( @xmath124 ) ; hence a viable alternative is that the latter feature represents the blue horn of emission from an annulus at @xmath125 and low inclination angle , with the @xmath120  kev being the red one , ( see fig .",
    "[ profiles ] ) .",
    "the mass of the black hole is estimated to be @xmath126 ( padovani & rafanelli 1988 ) , implying an orbital period of @xmath127  ks at @xmath34 , and @xmath128  ks at @xmath129 .",
    "observation is @xmath130  ks long , and so both explanations are viable as far as orbital time scales are concerned . to discriminate between the two solutions , we re - analysed the _ chandra _ observation , dividing it in three time intervals of equal duration about @xmath131  ks . in each time interval",
    "the feature is barely visible , as expected ( given the marginal detection ) if the line flux is constant .",
    "this result therefore favours a small value of the orbital radius . however , given the limited quality of the data , no definitive conclusions can be drawn in this respect .",
    "mrk  766 is one of the best studied narrow line seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "the presence of a broad , relativistic iron line in the spectrum of this source is , however , still an open issue .",
    "page et al . ( 2001 ) found evidence for a relativistic line in the first _",
    "xmm  newton _ observation .",
    "on the other hand , subsequent reanalysis of the same data set , as well as of the second _ xmm  newton _ observation ( pounds et al .",
    "2003 ) did not provide evidence for such a line .",
    "turner et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reported on the presence of a narrow feature at @xmath132  kev during the first @xmath133  ks of the second _ xmm  newton _ observation , when the source was in a high state , and at @xmath134  kev in the last @xmath131  ks , after a sudden drop in flux .",
    "the ew of the @xmath132  kev line is @xmath135  ev , that of the @xmath134 about 4 times higher .",
    "turner et al . preferred explanation is in terms of a decelerating ejected blob .",
    "let us instead discuss the system parameters in the orbiting spot hypothesis , even if the line and continuum variability are anticorrelated , contrary to what is expected in our model .",
    "clearly , if the model is correct , continuum variability and illumination of the matter must be very complex .",
    "assuming again that the observed narrow feature corresponds to the blue horn , the emission must come from small radii to account for the significant redshift .",
    "the mass of the black hole in this source is estimated to be @xmath136 ( wandel 2002 ) , corresponding to an orbital period of about @xmath137  ks for @xmath34 , much less than observing times for both states .",
    "hence we can assume that the line profile is averaged over several orbits .",
    "one possibility is that the inclination angle is very low , in which case we can neglect doppler shifts .",
    "we find that the radius corresponding to the redshift - factor @xmath27 of a spectral line is equal to @xmath138 ( in the schwarzschild limit ) . the emission radius",
    "would then have been moved from about @xmath139 in the first part of the observation to @xmath140 in the second part . increasing the inclination angle decreases the radius corresponding to a given @xmath27 in the blue horn because of doppler blueshift . for @xmath95 ( see fig .  [ profiles ] ) the radius is already lower than @xmath4 , requiring a spinning black hole .",
    "of course , at least part of the line shift may alternatively be due to ionization of the matter , which could also help explaining the larger equivalent width ( e.g. matt et al . 1996 ) .",
    "clearly , high throughput observations ( capable of detecting line features in short exposure times ) are necessary to break the degeneracy between @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "we discussed the possibility that the narrow features in the @xmath3@xmath4  kev range , recently discovered in a few agns and usually interpreted as redshifted iron lines , could be due to illumination by localized orbiting spots just above the accretion disc .",
    "if this is indeed the case , these features may provide a powerful and direct way to measure the black hole mass in active galactic nuclei . to this aim",
    ", it is necessary to follow the line emission along the orbit . the orbital radius ( in units of @xmath1 ) and the disc inclination",
    "can be inferred from the variations of the line flux and centroid energy .",
    "furthermore , @xmath2 can be estimated by comparing the measured orbital period with the value expected for the derived radius .",
    "as shown in the previous section , present - day x - ray instruments do not have enough collecting area to perform this task accurately .",
    "this capability should be achieved by the planned high - performance x - ray missions such as _ constellation  x _ and _ xeus_.",
