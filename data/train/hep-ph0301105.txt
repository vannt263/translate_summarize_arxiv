    "the study of decays @xmath1 , which is one of the gold plated channels for @xmath5-physics studies at the lhc , looks very interesting from the physics point of view .",
    "it presents several advantages related to the dynamics of these decays , characterized by proper - time - dependent angular distributions , which can be described in terms of bilinear combinations of transversity amplitudes .",
    "their time evolution involves , besides the values of two transversity amplitudes at the proper time @xmath6 and their relative strong phases , the following fundamental parameters : the difference and average value of decay rates of heavy and light mass eigenstates of @xmath7 meson , @xmath0 and @xmath8 , respectively , their mass difference @xmath9 , and the cp - violating weak phase @xmath10 .",
    "the angular analysis of the decays @xmath1 provides complete determination of the transversity amplitudes and , in principle , gives the access to all these parameters .    in the present paper",
    "we examine the performance of the angular - moments method @xcite applied to the angular analysis of untagged decays @xmath1 for the determination of @xmath0 . after giving the physics motivation in section 2 ,",
    "we describe in the next section the method of angular moments based on weighting functions introduced in ref .  @xcite . for the case of @xmath0 determination",
    "this method is properly modified in section 4 .",
    "the simub - package @xcite for physics simulation of @xmath5-meson production and decays has been used for monte carlo studies with two sets of weighting functions . in section 5",
    "we present the results of these studies and concentrate on the evaluation of measurement errors and their dependence on statistics .",
    "the angular distributions for decays @xmath1 are governed by spin - angular correlations ( see @xcite-@xcite ) and involve three physically determined angles . in case of the so - called helicity frame  @xcite , which is used in the present paper , these angles are defined as follows ( see fig .  [ b_dec_angl ] ) :    * the @xmath11-axis is defined to be the direction of @xmath12-particle in the rest frame of the @xmath7 . the @xmath13-axis is defined as any arbitrary fixed direction in the plane normal to the @xmath11-axis . the @xmath14-axis is then fixed uniquely via @xmath15 ( right - handed coordinate system ) . * the angles ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 )",
    "specify the direction of the @xmath18 in the @xmath19 rest frame while ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) give the direction of @xmath22 in the @xmath12 rest frame . since the orientation of the @xmath13-axis is a matter of convention , only the difference @xmath23 of the two azimuthal angles is physically meaningful .     in the helicity frame ,",

    "the time dependence of the transversity amplitudes for the transitions @xmath44 is not of purely exponential form due to the presence of @xmath45 mixing .",
    "this mixing arises due to either a mass difference or a decay - width difference between the mass eigenstates of the @xmath46 system .",
    "the time evolution of the state @xmath47 of an initially , i.e. at time @xmath6 , present @xmath7 meson can be described in general form as follows : @xmath48 i.e. , the state @xmath47 at time @xmath49 is a mixture of the flavor states @xmath50 and @xmath51 with probabilities defined by the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "in analogous way , the time evolution of the state @xmath54 of an initially present @xmath37 meson is described by the relation @xmath55    diagonalization of the full hamiltonian ( see @xcite for more details ) gives @xmath56 here @xmath57 are eigenvalues of the full hamiltonian corresponding to the masses and total widths of `` light '' and `` heavy '' eigenstates @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is a phase factor defining the @xmath60 transformation of flavor eigenstates of the neutral @xmath61-meson system : @xmath62 . in the case @xmath63 the probability for @xmath7 to oscillate to a @xmath37 is not equal to the probability of a @xmath37 to oscillate to a @xmath7 .",
