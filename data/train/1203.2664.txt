    "while the notion of orthogonality of lines in euclidean geometry has well founded meaning ( it is frequently used as a primitive notion , see @xcite ) , orthogonality of subspaces can be defined in several different ways .",
    "two of them were shown in @xcite to be sufficient in euclidean geometry ; actually , each of these two considered on the universe of subspaces of fixed dimension can be used to reinterpret the underlying point - line affine space and after that to define line orthogonality .",
    "thus the procedure of reinterpretation consists , in fact , in two steps and in the second step one should define orthogonality of lines in terms of a given orthogonality of subspaces . in this note",
    "we show that such a definition is possible for each prescribed values of dimensions of the considered subspaces ( theorem  [ thm : main ] ) .",
    "the notion of orthogonality of subspaces is not a unique - meaning relation , even if dimensions of the subspaces involved are fixed .",
    "therefore , we have to deal with a family of possible relations of orthogonality . and in this note we show that _ each one _ of these relations is sufficient to express the underlying geometry provided the latter has sufficiently high dimension ( theorem  [ thm : main ] ) .",
    "so , finally , we prove that euclidean geometry can be expressed in the language with points , subspaces ( of fixed dimensions ) , and orthogonality of subspaces .",
    "it is a folklore that affine geometry can be expressed as a theory of point-@xmath0-subspace incidence .",
    "euclidean geometry appears when we impose a relation of orthogonality on that `` affine '' structure .",
    "our result does not solve the problem whether euclidean geometry can be expressed in the language with @xmath0-subspaces _ as individuals _ and some of the orthogonalities introduced above as a single primitive notion , in that way , possibly , generalizing @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that the answer is affirmative , but the question is addressed in other papers .",
    "we close the paper with a list of some more interesting properties of the orthogonalities considered here .",
    "this list is not intended as a complete axiom system , but we think that at least some of its items can be used to build such a system characterizing orthogonality of subspaces .",
