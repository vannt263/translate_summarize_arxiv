    "ever since the detection of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in 1992 by the cobe satellite @xcite , the cmb has continued to surprise cosmologists and its prevalence is still outbreaking among different branches of physics .",
    "the heart of present - day observational cosmology dwells in the accurate measurement of cmb anisotropies .",
    "the survey of the cmb remains a very important tool to explore the physics of the early universe .",
    "the latest observational probes like wmap @xcite , planck @xcite , act @xcite , spt @xcite have led to extremely precise data resulting in a construction of a very accurate model of our universe . even though the latest data from planck show slight disagreement with the best - fit @xmath2cdm model for low multipoles ( @xmath3 ) at @xmath4 , the collective cmb data , so far as the entire regime of @xmath5 is concerned , are in excellent harmony with the @xmath2cdm model and gaussian adiabatic initial conditions with a slightly red - tilted power spectrum for the primordial curvature perturbation . to facilitate the confinement of cosmological models as well as the cosmological parameters further , we need more precise cmb measurements where secondary effects like weak gravitational lensing come into play .",
    "all through the voyage from the last scattering surface ( lss ) en - route to the present day detectors , the path of the cmb photons gets distorted by the potential gradients along the line of sight , this phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing . as a result of this lensing effect",
    ", the cmb temperature field is remapped .",
    "due to gravitational lensing , the acoustic peaks in the cmb angular power spectrum are smoothed @xcite and the power on smaller scales is enhanced @xcite . accordingly , the lensing of the cmb becomes more and more important as on smaller scales where there is very little intrinsic power .",
    "the remapping of power of the cmb anisotropy spectra by the effect of lensing is a very small effect , but it is important in the current era of precision cosmology . in other words , subtraction of the lensing artifact is essential to obtain a precise handle on the physics at the last scattering surface .",
    "in addition to the temperature anisotropies , the cmb is also linearly polarized , which was first detected by dasi @xcite .",
    "the observed polarization field is also lensed by the potential gradients along the line of sight . consequently , the cmb radiation field furnishes two additional lensed observables in the form of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarization modes .",
    "the primordial gravity waves generate ( along with primordial magnetic fields , if any ) the large scale @xmath1-mode signal .",
    "the precise measurement of the primordial @xmath1-mode polarization , although yet to be observed ( very recently spt has claimed a detection of cmb @xmath1- mode polarization @xcite produced by gravitational lensing ) , is very crucial in the context of inflation as it is directly related to the inflationary energy scale @xcite ( assuming there are no vector modes ) , which is essential to discriminate among different classes of inflationary models .",
    "however , there is a confusion between the cmb @xmath0 and @xmath1-modes in presence of lensing @xcite .",
    "the lensing of the cmb @xmath0-mode polarization produces a non - zero @xmath1-mode signal @xcite .",
    "hence , the detection of a large scale @xmath1-mode signal in cmb polarization experiments does not ensure that we are actually observing primordial gravity waves , as it may be due to the lensing artifact .",
    "the lensing effect may also produce non - gaussian features in the cmb maps @xcite .",
    "hence , it is important to properly separate out the lensing effect from the observed cmb anisotropy spectra to recover the true features of primordial cmb radiation .",
    "( we note , however , that if a complete forward modelling approach is used to compare to the data , reconstruction of the lensing potential power spectrum alone is sufficient . ) given the form of the primordial curvature perturbation , one can work out the cmb angular power spectra as well as the lensing potential power spectrum using codes such as camb . employing camb ,",
    "the corresponding lensed cmb spectra can also be estimated .",
    "however , the available observational data @xcite directly provide the lensed cmb spectra , and hence , our aim is to reconstruct the unlensed quantities directly from the observed lensed ones .    in this article , we provide a simple algorithm for direct reconstruction of intrinsic cmb spectra from the lensed ones by applying a matrix inversion technique .",
    "our technique assumes the availability of the lensing potential .",
    "though we do not address the lensing potential reconstruction here , it may be done when complete polarization data ( both @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarizations ) are available .",
    "we first construct the kernel matrix for the difference between the lensed and unlensed cmb angular power spectra , which only depends on the knowledge of the power spectrum for the lensing potential . for our present analysis",
    ", we have used the wmap 7-year best - fit spectra for @xmath2cdm + tens model , since this is the latest available data for lensing as of now . exploiting this matrix inversion technique , we are able to subtract out the lensing contribution from the cmb power spectra . as a preliminary test",
    ", we have also used the wmap 9-yr unbinned @xmath6 power spectrum and delensed by our matrix inversion technique , without taking into account the errors on the data .",
    "the corresponding lensing potential is generated by camb using the wmap 9-yr best - fit parameters for the @xmath2cdm + tens model .",
    "of course , this is just the first step towards extraction of unlensed cmb spectra , applicable under ideal conditions . for our theoretical framework to be applicable in the realistic situation ,",
    "the uncertainties coming from the noise in the measured spectra and the transfer function must also be taken into account .",
    "this method , may , in principle serve as an aid to resolve the confusion between the @xmath0 and @xmath1-mode once the cmb @xmath1-mode data is available and when a more realistic situation can be taken into account .",
    "the unlensed cmb spectra thus obtained , may also be helpful in increasing the level of precision in determining various cosmological parameters , though that potential consequence is not addressed in the present article .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ reviw ] ,",
    "we provide a brief review of the theory of the weak gravitational lensing of the cmb , which we will make use of in discussing the main body of the article in the subsequent sections . in section [ mit ] , we provide our theoretical framework for the matrix inversion technique .",
    "the numerical results , and possible sources of error are discussed in section [ num ] .",
    "we summarize our findings and discuss future prospects in a brief concluding section .",
    "weak gravitational lensing of the cmb photons occurs due to the intervening large - scale structure between the lss and the observer . due to the effect of weak lensing , a point @xmath7 , on the lss appears to be in a deflected position @xmath8 .",
    "the ( lensed ) temperature @xmath9 that we measure as coming from a direction @xmath10 in the sky , actually corresponds to the original ( unlensed ) temperature @xmath11 from a different direction @xmath12 , where @xmath10 and @xmath12 are related through the deflection angle @xmath13 , as @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , the polarization field is remapped according to @xmath15 .",
    "the change in direction on the sky , @xmath13 , can be related to the fluctuations of the gravitational potential , @xmath16 @xcite . in the linear theory ,",
    "@xmath16 can be related to the primordial curvature perturbation , @xmath17 , generated during inflation , through the transfer function , @xmath18 , by the relation @xmath19 . in terms of the primordial power spectrum @xmath20 , the angular power spectrum of the lensing potential @xmath21 , defined through @xmath22 ,",

    "the delensed spectra are over plotted on the wmap 9-year unbinned @xmath6 spectra . in the right panel ,",
    "the fractional difference between the lensed and delensed spectra is plotted .",
    "it can be seen that the lensing contribution is at the level of @xmath81 for values of @xmath82 .",
    "finally , we furnish a brief estimate of the possible sources of error in our analysis . in the flat sky approximation ,",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the error in ignoring terms beyond the second order in @xmath65 is extremely small , of the order of @xmath67 . the taylor series expansion for evaluating the unlensed spectra , eqns . ,",
    "- and eqns.- , ignores terms of the order of @xmath83 .",
    "this introduces an error of the order of @xmath83 , which we find to be at least four orders of magnitude below the contribution from the combination of the first and second order terms , for @xmath84 .",
    "as we go to higher @xmath5 values , the third order contribution increases , but it still remains at most @xmath85 of the first- and second - order contributions , for about @xmath86 , as can be seen from figs.[fig : error1 ] and [ fig : error2 ] .",
    "the fractional contribution of the @xmath83 term is of the order of @xmath79 for the @xmath6 spectrum at large multipoles @xmath87 , but it remains less than @xmath67 for the other cmb spectra . in the full - sky analysis ,",
    "we have neglected the @xmath88 terms entirely as they are very small ( of the order @xmath89 ) @xcite . in this case",
    "also , the contributions from the @xmath83 terms are tiny , as can be seen from figs.[fig : error1 ] and [ fig : error2 ] .",
    "hence , neglecting the @xmath83 terms does not really incorporate significant error in our analysis .",
    "further , our work did not take into account the effect of the non - linear evolution of the lensing potential which may also incorporate some additional error .",
    "however , non - linearities are increasingly important only in the very small scale regime .",
    "the integrated effect of the above errors leads to the overall accuracy of our analysis , estimated to be of the order of @xmath90 at the multipoles around @xmath74-@xmath75 by the calibration technique described above .",
    "a slightly more accurate result might possibly be obtained by using the full second order expressions for the lensed correlation functions in the full sky , as provided in appendix c of ref .",
    "@xcite , but would increase the computational expense .",
    "in this article , we have provided a new method to extract the intrinsic cmb power spectra from the lensed ones by applying a matrix inversion technique . after a through formal development of the theoretical framework",
    ", we use a fortran90 code to compare our results with camb .",
    "we find that for @xmath91 , both the results are almost identical with the fractional deviation being of the order of @xmath67 or so , but as we go beyond that , the difference becomes about @xmath73 - @xmath71 around @xmath92 .",
    "thus , this new technique can very well serve as a first step towards direct reconstruction of intrinsic cmb power spectra from the lensed map .",
    "to apply our methodology , the knowledge of lensing potential is necessary .",
    "the lensing potential can be reconstructed once we have the full cmb polarization data , _",
    "i.e. _ , both @xmath93 and @xmath94 mode .",
    "though we do not address the lensing potential reconstruction , it may be possible to construct the cmb lensing potential from the complete polarization data alone .",
    "there is a confusion between the cmb @xmath0- and @xmath1- polarization modes due to their mixing in the presence of weak lensing . nevertheless , using our matrix inversion technique ,",
    "it may be possible to obtain a handle on the intrinsic @xmath1-mode power by subtracting the lensing effect due to @xmath0-modes , once the lensing potential is known .",
    "of course , as we have clearly mentioned , this work is just the first step towards this reconstruction . here",
    ", obtaining the unlensed cmb spectrum and the demonstration of deconvolution of the lensing effect has been done in the ideal situation , without taking into account noise in the measured @xmath95 s , uncertainties in the transfer function and in the primordial power spectrum used in the transfer function as well as errors coming from other sources as discussed in section [ num ] . in the realistic situation , the above uncertainties need to be incorporated .",
    "we hope to address the reconstruction of the lensing potential from the lensed cmb polarization data ( with an estimate for large - scale @xmath1-mode power generated using camb ) in a future work .",
    "a possible further direction in which this work may be taken is in the increase of accuracy in determining various cosmological parameters , which we hope to address in future .",
