    "in 1d electron systems , interactions have a very pronounced effect and give rise to a variety of unusual phenomena @xcite . interacting 1d systems with a lattice potential display insulating behavior at commensurate filling .",
    "examples include charge density waves ( cdws ) , and fermions on a lattice with local hubbard interactions .",
    "due to interaction effects , the spin degrees of freedom are gapped and decoupled from the charge degrees of freedom , such that they do not influence the dynamics of charge transport . in these systems , the charge degrees of freedom are described by the quantum sine - gordon model .",
    "the low frequency response of a half filled system with periodic potential is characterized by an optical gap . hence at zero temperature the linear ac conductivity vanishes for frequencies smaller than the gap , apart from a series of discrete resonances which appear for sufficiently strong repulsive interaction @xcite . for frequencies larger than the gap energy the linear conductivity shows a power law dependence on frequency @xcite .",
    "similarly , the linear dc conductivity shows a power law dependence on temperature @xmath0 at temperatures larger than the spectral gap .    at zero temperature and frequency ,",
    "charge transport is only possible by tunneling of charge carriers , which can be described by instanton formation .",
    "the nonlinear dc - conductivity is characterized by@xcite @xmath1 , and for fixed value of the electric field strength is a monotonically increasing function of the ac frequency of the external field . in this work ,",
    "we revisit the instanton calculation of the nonlinear ac conductivity by maki and discuss in detail the physics of multi - photon absorption in the dynamic limit .",
    "in addition , we point out that in the static limit the efficiency of soliton - antisoliton pair annihilation and the dynamics of scattering between these quasiparticles decisively determines the value of the conductivity .    to be specific , we consider the quantum sine - gordon model .",
    "we first scale the system to its correlation length , where the influence of the potential is strong and a semiclassical instanton calculation becomes possible .",
    "we reproduce an earlier result @xcite for the nonlinear ac current within the matsubara formalism , and carefully analyze the dependence of the instanton creation rate on the ratio of electric field energy to photon energy . in the dynamic limit , the result can be interpreted in terms of multi - photon absorption .",
    "we compare the result of our semiclassical analysis to a fully quantum mechanical perturbative expression for a 1d band insulator .",
    "when expressing the semiclassical result in terms of the energy gap , the solitonic correlation length and effective velocity , it can be compared to the quantum mechanical expression . in the limit where the photon energy is much smaller than the optical gap",
    ", there is good agreement between the two expressions .",
    "as a reference point for the instanton calculation for interacting systems , we start by describing a fully quantum mechanical calculation of the conductivity of noninteracting 1d electrons with a periodic potential at half filling .",
    "the periodic potential splits the band into a valence and a conduction band , such that the system becomes a band insulator . when exposing the system to a monochromatic electric field @xmath2 , the only contribution to the ac conductivity comes from the excitation of electron - hole pairs .",
    "clearly , the linear ac conductivity vanishes as long as the photon energy @xmath3 is smaller than the band gap @xmath4 . in the following ,",
    "we sketch a derivation of the _ nonlinear _ ac conductivity .",
    "we follow the derivation described by wherrett @xcite .",
    "we consider a situation in which @xmath5 photons are needed to excite an electron from the valence to the conduction band , that is @xmath6 .",
    "the coupling to the electromagnetic field has its origin in the @xmath7 term in the hamiltonian , its matrix elements are given by @xmath8 in the last step it was assumed that the initial and final momentum are close to the fermi momentum , and that the ratio @xmath9 defines an effective velocity .",
    "we calculate the transition rate from fermi s golden rule as @xmath10 the density of states is given by @xmath11 .",
    "the transition amplitude @xmath12 between valence and conduction band involves @xmath13 virtual intermediate states . for odd @xmath5 ,",
    "these states correspond to the consecutive excitation and deexcitation between valence and conduction band . assuming that the transition matrix elements have no important energy dependence , it can be calculated as @xmath14 in the last step",

    "the dissipative part of the action describes a weak coupling of the electron system to a dissipative bath , for example phonons .",
    "it is needed for energy relaxation in soliton - antisoliton annihilation processes @xcite .",
    "we assume it to be so small that it does not influence the rg equations for the other model parameters significantly .",
    "the smooth part of the density is given by @xmath21 , and @xmath22 for cdws and lls , respectively .",

    "our calculations are valid for photon energies @xmath3 and electric field energies @xmath35 below the soliton energy @xmath36 . in this rg calculation , we do not attempt to treat a possible nonlinear dependence of coupling parameters on the external electric field .",
    "the full inclusion of the external field in an equilibrium theory is not possible as it renders the ground state of the system unstable .",
    "the quantum sine - gordon model has an infinite number of ground states connected by a shift of the phase field by @xmath37 . here",
    ", we concentrate on renormalizing each of these ground states separately and take into account the coupling between different ground states due to the external electric field in the framework of an instanton approach .",
    "we consider a time dependent external field @xmath38 , which upon analytical continuation @xmath39 turns into a field @xmath40 . in imaginary time , the electric field has to obey the same periodic boundary condition @xmath41 as other bosonic fields , e.g. the displacement field @xmath42 .",
    "this boundary condition is respected by a discrete fourier representation @xcite @xmath43 with matsubara frequencies @xmath44 .",
    "a monochromatic external field is hence described by @xmath45 . analytic continuation from matsubara frequencies to real frequencies is defined by @xmath46 .",
    "the original calculation @xcite did not make use of matsubara frequencies and used a dependence on imaginary time @xmath47 which does not respect the periodicity requirement in imaginary time and grows exponentially in @xmath48 .",
    "we define the ratio @xmath49 which is proportional to the ratio of the field energy acquired on a length scale @xmath50 and the photon energy @xmath3 .",
    "the static dc limit corresponds to @xmath51 , whereas the dynamic ac limit corresponds to @xmath52 .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath53 it does not matter whether one analytically continues to real frequencies before solving the equation of motion for the instanton or in the very end of the calculation .",
    "however , in the range @xmath54 , the two prescriptions lead to different results . using an oscillatory time dependence as defined by a monochromatic @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ matsubara.eq ] ) , the instanton solution becomes periodic in time and has no well defined beginning or end . on the other hand , using the time dependence eq .",
    "( [ cosh.eq ] ) in the equation of motion , the instanton is well defined and the final result agrees quantitatively with the quantum mechanical calculation presented in the previous section .",
    "although it is not very intuitive why the exponential time dependence eq .",

    "( [ action.eq ] ) is for weak external fields much smaller than the extension @xmath57 of the instanton .",
    "the domain wall energy per unit length is given by @xmath58 , and in contrast to the disordered case @xcite , the spontaneous formation of instantons due to quantum fluctuations needs not be considered as the domain wall energy is spatially constant in the present model .",

    "one finds @xmath73 this result gives rise to an instanton creation rate @xmath74 this instanton creation rate can be interpreted in terms of multi - photon absorption : the optical gap in the system is @xmath75 , and hence the smallest integer larger than the ratio @xmath76 determines the number of photons necessary to create one soliton - antisoliton pair .",
    "the ratio of electric field strength to photon energy in the brackets agrees exactly with the noninteracting result eq .",
    "( [ perturbative.eq ] ) if one identifies @xmath77 , uses the definition of the soliton energy , and considers the fermionic case @xmath78 .",
    "the present semiclassical approximation can be expected to work well for @xmath79 when the photon number is large and the electrical field can be treated unquantized .",
    "however , it does not reproduce the threshold behavior expected whenever the photon energy is tuned through an integer fraction of the optical gap @xmath80 . the specific physics of a mott insulator as compared to a band insulator is contained in the energy dependent form factor , which for the band insulator is just the density of states .",
    "the energy dependence of the form factor is probably contained in fluctuation corrections around the saddle point , which would be interesting to calculate .",
    "the main conclusion from the agreement between the semiclassical and the quantum mechanical result is that the dominant electric field dependence for the mott insulator is similar to that of the band insulator when expressed in suitable effective quantities , which parameterize the interaction strength .",
    "the quantum sine - gordon model is integrable , and in the absence of additional interaction terms or a coupling to a dissipative bath its solitonic excitations have an infinite life time . according to this logic , even an infinitesimally small density of solitons would give rise to an infinite dc conductivity .",
    "this conclusion does not sound realistic , and in the following we will discuss the behavior expected from physical systems which are approximately described by this model .    as both kinks and antikinks carry a topological quantum number , they can not simply decay but only annihilate each other @xcite . pairwise annihilation gives rise to a decay rate @xmath81 and hence @xmath82 in equilibrium . as kinks and antikinks are solitary waves , this annihilation is only possible in the presence of a dissipative bath .    in the dynamic limit with multi - photon absorption ,",
    "the kink and anti - kink created by the electric field stay close to each other and it seems plausible that they will annihilate quickly such that the nonlinear ac conductivity can be calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ absorption.eq ] ) .",
    "the static limit is more subtle .",
    "maki @xcite suggested to calculate the conductivity according to eq .",
    "( [ absorption.eq ] ) in the dc limit as well , which would imply that every kink and antikink that come close to each other annihilate with certainty .",
    "this assumption would only be justified if the coupling to the dissipative bath was strong .",
    "if the coupling to the dissipative bath was weak , there would be a finite density of kinks and antikinks , and the conductivity would depend on their mean free path . under the assumption @xcite",
    "that the mean free path is of the order of the inter - particle distance , the product of equilibrium density and mean free path would be of order one , and the conductivity would not be exponentially suppressed anymore , a result quite different from the exponential suppression in the case of strong dissipation .    in summary , we have discussed the nonlinear ac conductivity of interacting 1d electron systems in a periodic potential .",
    "we found that the dominant physical process in the dynamical limit is multi - photon absorption , and that the result of an instanton calculation is in quantitative agreement with a fully quantum mechanical calculation for noninteracting electrons in the limit of a large number of simultaneously absorbed photons .    _",
