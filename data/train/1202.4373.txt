    "after the recent measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb hereafter ) anisotropies , galaxy clustering and supernovae type ia luminosity distances ( see e.g. @xcite ) cosmology has entered a `` golden age '' where not only a `` standard '' model of structure formation has been firmly established but also where physical assumptions not testable in laboratory can now be probed with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "one of the most promising aspects of this new cosmological framework is indeed the possibility of testing variations of fundamental constants on scales , times and energies drastically different from those on earth .    a variation of fundamental constants in time , while certainly exciting , represents a radical departure from standard model physics . in the past years",
    "much of attention has been focused on the fine structure constant @xmath1 mainly because of the observational indication of a smaller value in the past , at cosmological redshifts @xmath5 , from quasar absorption systems data with @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , these observations have been complemented with new data from the very large telescope ( vlt ) , covering a different region of the sky .",
    "this data shows an opposite evolution for @xmath1 , i.e. an increase respect to the local , present value , by approximately the same amount ( @xcite ) and leading to the hypothesis of an anisotropic variation in @xmath1 .",
    "while all these measurements could be affected by some hidden systematics the search for variations of the fine structure constant in the early universe is clearly a major and timely line of investigation in modern astrophysics ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "cmb anisotropies have provided in the past years a powerful method to constrain variations of the fine structure constant . since the cmb anisotropies were generated at the epoch of recombination , approximately @xmath7 years after the big bang , they probe the value of the fine structure constant at that time , when the universe was nearly isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "constraints have been obtained analyzing cmb data ( see e.g. @xcite ) with an accuracy at the level of @xmath8 . in the most recent analysis , parametrizing a variation in the fine structure constant as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the standard ( local ) value and @xmath1 is the value during the recombination , the authors of @xcite found the constraint @xmath11 , i.e. hinting also to a more than two standard deviation from the current value .    while the current cmb bound is considerably weaker than the observed variation from quasar spectra , the cmb recombination occurred at a time period corresponding to redshift @xmath12 .",
    "it is quite possible that @xmath1 has larger variations at higher redshifts , i.e. there is no reason for the variation to be constant in time .",
    "the cmb bound provides therefore important constraints on the running of the fine structure constant .    in the next few years",
    ", we expect a further significant improvement in the quantity and quality of cosmological data .",
    "the planck satellite mission ( see  @xcite ) , for example , will provide accurate temperature cmb maps by the end of this year . on the other hand new and larger",
    "galaxy surveys are either already operating either under study .",
    "some of these surveys will provide new galaxy weak lensing measurements that , when combined with planck , will drastically improve the constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "the euclid satellite mission @xcite , selected as part of esa cosmic visions programme and due for launch in 2019 , probably represents the most advanced weak lensing survey that could be achieved in the current decade .",
    "future weak lensing surveys will measure photometric redshifts of billions of galaxies allowing the possibility a tomographic reconstruction of growth of structure as a function of time through a binning of the redshift distribution of galaxies , with a considerable improvement of cosmological information ( e.g. dark energy @xcite ; on neutrinos @xcite ; the dark matter distribution as a function of redshift @xcite and the growth of structure @xcite ) .",
    "as far as we know , there is however still no study in the literature that considered the gain in constraining variation in fundamental constant from these surveys .",
    "it is therefore timely to forecast the constraints on variation of the fine structure constant achievable from weak lensing data from the euclid satellite mission . in this paper",
    "we indeed perform this kind of analysis . as expected ,",
    "weak lensing probes are shown to be complementary to cmb measurements and to significantly improve the constraints on variation in the fine structure constant .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : iii ] contains the description of the simulated future data used in our analyses .",
    "the results from our markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analyses are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] .",
    "we draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] .",
    "in this section we describe the method adopted to simulate the future cmb and weak lensing surveys data used then to forecast the constraints on @xmath1 and the remianing cosmological parameters .    the fiducial cosmological model assumed in producing the simulated data is the best - fit model from the wmap seven year cmb survey ( see ref .",
    "the parameters are : baryon density @xmath13 , cold dark mattter density @xmath14 , spectral index @xmath15 , optical depth @xmath16 , scalar amplitude @xmath17 and hubble constant @xmath18 . for the fine structure constant we assume either the standard value @xmath19 , either a small variation @xmath20 , that we believe could be detectable with these future data .    as stated in the introduction we consider cmb data from planck and galaxy weak lensing measurements from euclid . for cmb data the main observables are the @xmath21 angular power spectra for temperature , polarization and cross temperature - polarization . for weak lensing data we consider the convergence power spectra @xmath22 following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "all spectra are generated using a modified version of the camb code  @xcite taking into account the possible variation in the fine structure constant as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we create a full mock cmb dataset with noise properties consistent with those expected for the planck  @xcite experiment ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : exp ] ) .",
    ".planck - like experimental specifications .",
    "channel frequency is given in ghz , the temperature sensitivity per pixel in @xmath23 , and fwhm ( full - width at half - maximum ) in arc - minutes .",
    "the polarization sensitivity is assumed as @xmath24 . [ cols=\">,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this brief paper we have evaluated the ability of a combination of cmb and weak lensing measurements as those expected from the planck and euclid satellite experiments in constraining variations in the fine structure constant @xmath1 .",
    "we have found that combining the data from those two experiments would provide a constraint on @xmath1 of the order of @xmath25 , significantly improving the constraints expected from planck .",
    "these constraints can be reasonably futher improved by considering additional datasets . in particular , accurate measurements of large angle cmb polarization that could provide a better determination of the reionization optical depth",
    "will certainly make the constraints on @xmath1 more stringent .",
    "moreover , we found that allowing in the analysis for variations in @xmath1 has important impact in the determination of parameters as @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath26 from a planck+euclid analysis .",
    "we have shown that a variation of @xmath1 of about @xmath27 can significantly alter the conclusions on these parameters .    changing the fine structure constant by @xmath27 shifts the redshift at which the free electron fraction falls to @xmath28 by about @xmath29 from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "an unknown physical process that delays recombination as , for example , dark matter annihilation ( see e.g. @xcite ) , may have a similar impact in cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "our conclusions can therefore be applied to the more general case of a modified recombination scenario .",
    "we are grateful to tom kitching , luigi guzzo , henk hoekstra e will percival for useful comments to the manuscript .",
    "we also thank luca amendola and martin kunz and the euclid theory wg .",
