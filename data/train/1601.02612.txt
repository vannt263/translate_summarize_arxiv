    "the total number of open clusters in the galaxy is estimated to be up to one hundred thousand ; due to large amounts of reddening , crowding , and disruption , we only know a few thousand of them toward the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the ones we observe are mostly located between 5 and 20 kpc from the galactic center , with ages ranging from a few myr to approximately 10 gyr . from the total , only about 10% survive their embedded stage as gravitationally bound systems .",
    "orbital elements of open clusters show that the majority were formed within a galactocentric radius of 10.5 kpc and closer than 180 pc from the galactic plane .",
    "the most massive open clusters can reach lifetimes comparable to the age of the universe , probably even becoming the seeds of some globular clusters .",
    "open clusters are thought to form from dense molecular gas clouds . in the galaxy molecular gas",
    "is at an extremely short scale - heigth of the disk plane , approximately 50 to 75 pc , and moves in dynamically cold orbits ( almost circular and with low inclination ) , therefore it is naturally expected open clusters to follow these type of orbits .",
    "although some molecular gas is known to exist above the galactic plane , these high - latitude clouds , are orders of magnitude smaller than giant molecular clouds and they are frequently not self - gravitating @xcite . however , there is a non - negligible fraction ( 13% ) of open clusters at heights greater than 200pc over the plane of the galaxy , far beyond where the molecular clouds reside @xcite , which might be an indication either of an unusual origin @xcite , or of some dynamical effect produced by the galaxy , as discussed in this letter .",
    "open clusters older than 1 gyr seem to be part of a separate structure gravitationally trapped by the main body of the galaxy known as the `` cluster thick disk '' @xcite .    explaining how open clusters reach such altitudes over the galactic plane",
    "poses a difficult challenge since no universally accepted explanation has been found for their existence .",
    "the preferred scenarios that have been proposed to address this problem postulate that clusters are captured from satellite galaxies or formed through star formation events in situ of high galactic altitude gas clouds @xcite .",
    "however , the galaxy seems to be dominated by smooth and well - mixed vertical age and metallicity gradients , meaning that the main mechanisms governing its evolution have been for a long time internal dynamical processes @xcite , this provides us with a hint to select for the present work , a deeper study on the non - axisymmetric large - scale structures as the drivers for the presence of a fraction of the high - altitude open clusters .",
    "this mechanism has been already proposed and disregarded in the past on the basis of theoretical simplified considerations such as direct ( and of low probability ) close encounters of clusters with compact molecular clouds employing the impulse approximation , or with the spiral arms as a potential well using idealized models @xcite . however , with three - dimensional extensions , @xcite and @xcite found that vertical resonance capture might be a mechanism to lift particles above the plane .",
    "to carry out this study , a careful construction of the initial conditions was a key ingredient , in addition to a very detailed , observationally motivated milky way galactic potential .",
    "the open clusters are represented as test particles in the multicomponent galactic field . in this approximation",
    "we are interested only on the destiny of clusters , each as a unit , from an orbital point of view .",
    "the model includes an axisymmetric potential , formed by a miyamoto & nagai ( 1975 ) disk and bulge , and a massive halo @xcite . for the spiral arms we employ the perlas model @xcite that consists of a bisymmetric self - gravitating three - dimensional density distribution . for the galactic bar we use a non - homogeneous triaxial ellipsoid that reproduces the density law of the cobe / dirbe triaxial central structure of the galaxy .",
    "for further details on the model see @xcite .    to fit our model",
    "we make use of observational / theoretical parameters in literature .",
    "the triaxial length of the bar is set to 3.5 kpc , with scale - lengths of 1.7 , 0.64 and 0.44 kpc .",
    "the total mass is 1.4 @xmath0 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 with a pattern speed @xmath3 = 45 @xmath4 . for the spiral arms ,",
    "we consider a pitch angle of @xmath5 = 15.5@xmath6 and a mass ratio of @xmath7 = 0.05 at a pattern speed @xmath8 = 20 @xmath4 .",
    "further details on the parameters of the model and restrictions were introduced in @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions for the particle distribution are setup by following the miyamoto - nagai density profile for the disk .",
    "to discretize the miyamoto - nagai density profile and distribute particles , we used the von neumann accept / reject algorithm @xcite .",
    "particle velocities are assigned with the strategy proposed by @xcite , approximated by the second moment of the boltzmann equation assuming the epicyclic approximation .",
    "we ran control simulations with the axisymmetric components of the model to check that the initial velocity dispersion of the particle distribution does not evolve significantly over 5 gyrs , this ensures that the initial stellar disk particle distribution is relaxed within the background potential .",
    "we now introduce the spiral arms and the bar to the potential .",
    "both components are grown adiabatically into the simulation , during a period of time long enough to avoid artificial effects in the particle kinematics .",
    "the mass of each component will be zero at time @xmath9 and will increase with time until they reach its maximum value at a given time @xmath10 ; once @xmath11 the mass of each component remains fixed . the functional form to model the mass increment with time",
    "is taken from @xcite .",
    "this particular temporal dependence allows a smooth variation for the value of the mass within the time interval @xmath12 .",
    "the mass of the spiral arms is given as a fraction of the mass of the disk and the mass of the bar is taken from the mass of the bulge .",
    "following this procedure we made some tests using different growing periods for the non axisymmetric structures @xmath13 gyr .",
    "for each case all measurements start after the non - axisymmetric components have been fully grown .",
    "we found no significant differences in the final results .",
    "nonetheless we took the value @xmath14 gyr that will guarantee the absence of artificial effects in the measurements .",
    "we first isolate the spiral arms effect . we start with @xmath15 particles , representing the open clusters , distributed on a cold disk , with @xmath16 for @xmath17",
    ", we follow the evolution of the system for @xmath18 after the arms have grown completely .",
    "figure [ fig : control ] shows how particles in the cold disk move away from the midplane due to the gravitational interaction with the spiral arms .",
    "the plot is a comparison with the axisymmetric case ( top panels ) , along @xmath19 ( from left to right ) , where no particles are scattered in the vertical direction . on the bottom , the galactic model with spiral arms , from the point where arms reach their total mass at @xmath10 ( bottom left panel ) , to @xmath19 after , at @xmath20 ( bottom right panel ) . in this case",
    ", lots of particles are scattered to large distances above and below the midplane . by comparing both models",
    ", we can establish that the collective gravitational effect of the spiral arms induces long vertical excursions of open clusters .",
    "note the bulge - like structure that the model predicts would be formed by a number of these clusters .        to quantify the number of particles departing from the initial cold disk ,",
    "first we divide the disk into radial bins of width @xmath21 and count the number of particles with @xmath22 .",
    "top left panel in figure [ fig:200pc ] shows the number of particles with @xmath23 for each radial bin ; the initial measure ( blue ) is taken once the arms have reached their total mass , and from there the count is followed for another @xmath18 .",
    "more and more particles raise at all radii , although it is more efficient toward the galactic bulge .",
    "bottom left panel in figure [ fig:200pc ] shows the difference @xmath24 measured every @xmath19 within each radial bin .",
    "although there are some negative values for the quantity @xmath25 , these are small , and the overall trend is clear and indicates that as an outcome of the interaction with the spiral arms , the number of particles that move away from the galactic plane ( @xmath22 ) increases with time .      with the previous procedure to introduce the spiral arms , the count of uprising particles might be underestimated ; namely , we are letting the arms grow adiabatically for @xmath26 and we are not measuring any quantity during this period .",
    "although starting the analysis from the time the arms have grown completely avoids any transient effect appearing in the results , this procedure leave us without knowledge of the true initial time from which the kinematics of the particles starts being affected by the spiral arms .",
    "this means that we are losing some information because aside from possible relaxation effects , the particles are already interacting with the arms while these are growing .    with the aim of recovering the physical information lost during the growing period , we apply the following numerical procedure .",
    "\\a ) we distribute @xmath15 particles in density and velocity space as in section [ sec : ic ] , but initially setting @xmath27 and @xmath28 , i.e. , we start with a two - dimensional particle distribution",
    ". then the simulation starts running with the arms introduced adiabatically within the first @xmath26 .",
    "\\b ) once the arms have reached their total mass , the numerical integration goes for another @xmath29 to allow the particles to relax with the spiral background potential . at this point",
    "the arms are totally formed and the stellar disk is relaxed .",
    "\\c ) now for each particle at a given radial coordinate @xmath30 , a @xmath31 coordinate and @xmath32 velocity are assigned following the usual procedure ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ic ] ) . at this stage",
    "we have recovered our three - dimensional disk but with the particles already relaxed in the radial direction .",
    "this point is closer to what we call an `` initial time '' since at the end of this new procedure , we have gotten rid of most of the spurious reaction , providing us with a better starting point for the calculations .    finally , the integration restarts from here for another @xmath18 , which includes all the periods of interest . measurements made from here will capture as many as possible of the particles that undergo large vertical excursions above and below the midplane .    for this alternative numerical implementation we repeated the counts as described above for particles with @xmath33 ( right panels in figure [ fig:200pc ] ) .",
    "we see the same behavior found before , that the number of particles with high @xmath34 increase with time due to their interaction with the spiral arms . but",
    "a first comparison of the top panels in figure [ fig:200pc ] , shows that for the second procedure , the number of particles at the starting point with high @xmath34 , is smaller than in the previous procedure , mainly toward the galactic center .",
    "the relaxation strategy of the disk avoids the loss of information that is inherent to the growing period of the arms .",
    "this has direct consequences for the effective number of particles scattered away from the midplane at the end of the simulation , as seen by comparing bottom panels in figure [ fig:200pc ] .",
    "we see that the count of uprising particles is slightly larger for the second numerical procedure , as expected .",
    "we have shown that particles in a cold disk can be scattered away from the midplane of the disk in an effective fashion by gravitational interaction with the spiral arms . now , in order to study the effect of the galactic bar , we introduce a triaxial potential , observationally motivated ( see section [ model ] ) . after the bar is totally formed , we follow the time evolution of the particle disk for another @xmath18 .    in the third row of figure [ fig:2edgeon ] , we show the initial and final stages for the @xmath18 evolution .",
    "contrary to the result in the previous experiment with only spiral arms , the bar does not drive particles away from the midplane of the disk .",
    "this is because the bar , compared to the arms , is efficient for capturing particles in orbits mostly confined within the triaxial structure , rather than crossing the potential well of the bar periodically , as it seems to be occurring with the spiral arms .",
    "therefore , the massive bar acts more as an attractor that confines the clusters , spreading them radially instead of scattering them away from the plane of the disk .",
    "the spiral arms , on the other hand , are capable to imprint vertical accelerations to the particles due to the concentration , but they do not seem to be massive enough to retain them , resulting in particles moved away from the plane .    the most realistic case for the milky way is when the bar and spiral arms are present . to study this case , both are introduced adiabatically during the simulation ( as described in section [ sec : simulationsa ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig:2edgeon ] ( fourth row ) shows the result of the @xmath18 evolution .",
    "lots of particles in this case are again scattered away from the plane , even in the presence of the bar .",
    "the vertical response of the disk is a combination of the previous two experiments : the arms scatter particles to large vertical distances , although these new distances are slightly diminished by the presence of the bar toward the galactic center .",
    "quantifying the effect with particle counts , we noticed they can reach altitudes larger than @xmath35 . by dividing the disk into radial bins of width @xmath21 we count the number @xmath36 of particles with @xmath37 every @xmath19 as shown in figure [ fig:1kpc ] for the simulations with spiral arms ( left ) and bar+arms ( right ) . at the initial time",
    "the number of particles with @xmath38 is almost zero for the two experiments , and from there the number @xmath36 of these particles increases with time in both cases . as we saw earlier , when comparing the third and fourth rows in figure [ fig:2edgeon ] , figure [ fig:1kpc ] shows that the number @xmath36 of particles with @xmath39 is always greater for the case with the spiral arms alone than with the combination of bar+arms . in either case",
    ", particles are still being scattered to high altitudes , @xmath35 or more above the plane .",
    "the collective effect of the spiral arms produces a chaotic diffusion of a number of the very cold open cluster orbits that drives them very high over the disk plane . in figure",
    "[ fig : orb ] we show one example of those orbits . at early times",
    "the particle moves mainly on the plane , then at @xmath40 , the orbit is deflected upwards .",
    "after this point the orbit is no longer confined to the plane ; further interactions with the spiral arms move it to even higher altitudes .",
    "chaotic stellar orbits are very common , and in some cases , they may even outnumber the regular orbits in a stellar system . to see if this is the case for the particles with high altitudes in our simulations we used the classification code by @xcite , based on the method of spectral dynamics introduced by @xcite .",
    "we applied the orbital classifier to the total sample of orbits that ended up the simulation with high @xmath31 . in the specific case of high - reaching orbits",
    ", we found that : one - third of the orbits that go above 200 pc are chaotic orbits , with the rest being tube orbits ; for the orbits that go above 500 pc , this fraction has gone up to about one - half ; by the time the orbits go beyond 1 kpc , slightly over one half are chaotic .",
    "chaos seems to be the dominant mechanism to explain the highest reaching orbits . as for the tube high - reaching orbits",
    ", the mechanism might be associated with resonances .",
    "with the use of a detailed observationally motivated model of the milky way galaxy and a set of carefully constructed cold initial conditions for the newly born open clusters , we study the effect of the spiral arms and bar on the orbits of open clusters .",
    "particularly , we are interested in the contribution of the large - scale non - axisymmetric structures to the high elevation of open clusters over the galactic plane .",
    "we find that spiral arms are able to induce large excursions of clusters orbits up to 3 kpc heights over the plane of the disk , depending on their specific parameters .",
    "all results in this work were computed assuming a spiral arms mass of @xmath41 of the disk ( corresponding to a relative torque @xmath42 ) and a pitch angle of 15.5@xmath43 .",
    "we performed a second simulation with a mass of @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "for the second case , the behavior is similar but diminished by a factor of @xmath46 by number , and a factor of @xmath47 by height , with respect to the @xmath41 mass case of the spiral arms ( in a future paper we will present this study ) .",
    "this means that for spiral arms with larger pitch angles than the 15.5@xmath43 usually assumed for the milky way , or higher masses of the spiral arms for instance , the quantity of these clusters could be even larger .    on the other hand ,",
    "the bar , despite its total mass , has a much smaller effect .",
    "the difference in this behavior is due to the density , which allows the spiral arms to give stronger kicks to the clusters .",
    "the net effect of the bar is to concentrate the orbits toward the galactic plane and to produce a radially outward diffusion of cluster orbits .    in the full model that includes both spiral arms and bar , despite the presence of the more massive bar , spiral arms are readily able to raise up an important percentage of the simulated open clusters through chaotic diffusion , as tested from a spectral classification analysis of the resultant high - z orbits ;",
    "while the bar produces the same radial diffusion and at the same time seems to concentrate the orbits toward the galactic plane , slightly reducing the effect of the arms .",
    "the cluster system forms a bulge - like structure .",
    "although the bar shrinks the cluster system , it is still half ( or more ) of the size of the case with only spiral arms . in an extended ongoing paper ( l.a .",
    "martinez - medina et al . in preparation ) , we will present a detailed study based both on an analytical approximation to destruction rates and tidal radii of known clusters and also a second order analytical approximation and finally n - body simulations with clusters to ponder their survival rates in the plane and off the plane in a milky way detailed model .",
