    "throughout history , there is a fundamental question that has been asked : what is the smallest building block of matter ?",
    "how do these building blocks interact with each other ?",
    "our best answer to this question to date is the standard model , which includes 12 fermions as elementary particles and gauge bosons as force carriers .",
    "one missing piece from the standard model is the higgs boson .",
    "the standard model also assumes two major interactions between particles - quantum electroweak and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite .",
    "qcd is a theory that describes the strong interactions of the quarks and gluons .",
    "it is a non - abelian gauge field theory based on the @xmath14(3 ) yang - mills theory of color - charged quarks  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) assumes that charged particles interact by exchanging charge neutral particles .",
    "the non - abelian character of qcd does allow the force carrier , in this case gluons , to carry gauge charges and to couple to themselves .",
    "thus two peculiar properties of qcd are generated : color confinement  @xcite and asymptotic freedom  @xcite .",
    "the spatial potential between strongly interacting quarks can be described as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the quark spacing , @xmath17 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath18 is a constant that describes the long range interactions .",
    "if quarks interact at short distances , the first term dominates , which can be understood as the exchange of a single gluon .",
    "this results in a 1/@xmath16 potential .",
    "however , as two quarks separate , due to the fact that gluons also carry color charge and can interact with themselves , the gluon fields form narrow tubes of color charge and cause a constant force between quarks as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1_1_01 ] .",
    "this means that it would require infinite energy to remove quarks from hadrons . in particle collisions ,",
    "new quark - antiquark pairs will spontaneously appear to break the tube and form new hadrons .",
    "thus quarks are always confined in hadrons .     a confining flux tube forms between distant quarks , which results in a constant force as a function of distance .",
    "for interpretation of the references to color in this and all other figures , the reader is referred to the electronic version of this dissertation . ]",
    "similar to the running coupling constant in qed , the renormalized qcd effective coupling constant @xmath19 depends on the renormalization scale .",
    "however , due to gluon self - interaction , the dependence is different .",
    "coupling constant @xmath19 can be written as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the qcd scale and @xmath22 is the momentum transfer scale .",
    "when @xmath23 , the coupling decreases logarithmically with increasing energy , which is known as asymptotic freedom .",
    "asymptotic freedom also suggests that the qcd can only be calculated perturbatively for high momentum transfer interactions or over short distances .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1_1_02 ] shows the measurements of @xmath24 as a function of the respective energy scale @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "summary of measurements of @xmath26 as a function of the respective energy scale q  @xcite . ]      due to the color confinement , quarks can only move in the volume of a hadron at normal temperature and density .",
    "however , in extreme high density and temperature conditions , matter is compressed beyond a density where hadron boundaries overlap and merge . in this case",
    ", color charges can be screened in a manner analogous to debye screening for electric charges . in this way",
    ", the distance over which the long - range interaction occurs is shortened in a dense medium of charges .",
    "this screening effect results in the deconfinement of strongly interacting particles that are now free to propagate through the dense matter .",
    "therefore the hadronic matter is transformed to a new state of matter called a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . the transition from a hadronic state to a qgp is accompanied by an increase in the ( color ) degrees of freedom , implying an increase in the entropy density and pressure as the temperature increases .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1_2_01 ] shows the equation of state from lattice qcd calculations  @xcite , obtained on temporal extent @xmath27 lattices .",
    "the ratio of the pressure over @xmath28 rises rapidly when the temperature goes above the critical temperature @xmath29 mev , which indicate a phase transition from a hadronic matter phase to a qgp phase .",
    "current experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) populate the region of @xmath30 , far from the stefan - boltzmann limits where the system has massless , weakly interacting quarks and gluons .",
    "we should still expect strong interactions in the qgp created experimentally .     the pressure normalized by @xmath28 as a function of the temperature on @xmath31 = 6 , 8 and 10 lattices  @xcite . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1_2_02 ] shows the qcd phase diagram of nuclear matter as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential ( @xmath32 ) . at low temperatures and for @xmath32 around 1 gev",
    ", matter exists in the regular hadronic state . if the temperature remains low but the @xmath32 increases , ordered quark matter phases are predicted .",
    "when @xmath32 is very large , the quarks start to form cooper pairs , resulting in a weakly interacting fermi liquid of quarks called  color superconductivity \"  @xcite .",
    "this phase of matter is predicted to exist in the core of a neutron star .",
    "on the other hand , if the temperature is high and @xmath32 is relatively small , a deconfined quark gluon plasma phase is expected .",
    "both lattice qcd and experimental data indicate this transition from hadronic matter to quark gluon plasma is a analytical transition ( cross - over )  @xcite , while some theoretical calculations predict that the transition at lower temperatures and high @xmath32 is a 1st order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "if there exists a phase transition at higher @xmath33 , with a cross - over at @xmath34 , the phase transition would end in a critical point at finite @xmath33 .",
    "however , due to the difficulty of lattice qcd calculations at finite @xmath32 , accurate predictions of the critical point location are still lacking  @xcite .",
    "therefore it falls to experiment to search for traces of the existence of the critical point of qcd  @xcite .     the phase diagram of qcd matter  @xcite . ]      currently , the only way to experimentally study the deconfined qgp is through heavy ion collisions .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1_2_03 ] shows the space - time evolution of a typical heavy ion collision .",
    "the collision starts with two incoming nuclei traveling at nearly the speed of light . during the first few fm/@xmath35 of the collision ,",
    "the system is dominated by hard processes like quark pair production , jet production and fragmentation . with the evolution of interactions among partons , the system reaches ( local ) equilibrium and forms a strongly interacting qgp . due to the strong internal pressure ,",
    "the qgp expands and cools .",
    "once its temperature drops to around @xmath36 , the phase transition from qgp to hadronic matter occurs ( hadronization ) .",
    "since the phase transition is a cross - over , a mixed phase exists around @xmath36 .",
    "when the system cools further , the inelastic scattering stops and the relative ratios of different hadron species are fixed ( chemical freeze - out ) , and finally elastic interactions between particles stop and the system comes to kinetic freeze - out .",
    "the final state particles then stream out and are detected experimentally .",
    "space - time evolution of a heavy ion collision .",
    "the figure is taken from ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "one unique feature of heavy ion collisions is the collision geometry .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : fig1_2_04 ] shows the collision of two lorentz - contracted gold nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the lorentz factor is about 100 for @xmath3 = 200 gev ( 100 agev in each direction ) , which makes the nucleus appear as a flat disk in the laboratory frame of reference .",
    "the right panel shows the same collision viewed along the beam pipe .",
    "the impact parameter , @xmath37 , is defined as the distance between the center of two nuclei in the plane transverse to their direction .",
    "another variable related to geometry is the number of participant nucleons , @xmath38 , which is defined as the number of nucleons that undergo at least one inelastic nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "if a collision occurs with the two nuclei almost overlapping with each other , one would expect a small impact parameter and a large @xmath38 .",
    "this is called a central collision . on the other hand ,",
    "if the overlapping volume is small , a peripheral collision with large impact parameter and small @xmath38 will occur .",
    "experimentally , most qgp signals only exist in central collisions where the system size is the largest .",
    "geometry of a high - energy heavy - ion collision  @xcite . ]",
    "unfortunately , neither impact parameter nor @xmath38 can be measured directly . one way to determine",
    "the centrality is to combine monte - carlo simulations and experimental data .",
    "the multiplicity of observed charged particles can then be correlated with centrality .",
    "one finds that a larger multiplicity of charged particles corresponds to a more central collision . using the multiplicity , one",
    "can then determine the impact parameter and @xmath38 using glauber model calculations  @xcite . at star",
    ", the centrality is defined using  reference multiplicity \" and is grouped in increments of 0 - 5% , 5 - 10% , 10 - 20% , 20 - 30% , 30 - 40% , 40 - 50% , 50 - 60% , 60 - 70% and 70 - 80% of the total reaction cross section .",
    "illustration of the reaction plane definition . ]    in non - central collisions , the overlap area of two nuclei is not symmetric . instead , it has a short axis in the transverse plane , which is parallel to the impact parameter , and a long axis perpendicular to it .",
    "the reaction plane is defined by the impact parameter vector and the momentum vector of the projectile as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1_2_05 ] .",
    "again , the true reaction plane ca nt be measured directly from data . but as discussed later , the event plane , which is a good approximation of reaction plane , can be measured event by event via azimuthal distributions of particle multiplicity  @xcite .",
    "quadratic and quartic fluctuations of baryon number , electric charge , and strangeness .",
    "all quantities have been normalized to the corresponding free quark gas values @xcite . ]    as discussed in the previous chapter , one major challenge in relativistic heavy ion physics is to understand the structure of the qcd phase diagram , i.e. , locate the end point of the first order phase transition line from the deconfined qgp phase to a hadronic gas phase .",
    "similar to the critical opalescence phenomenon in other second - order phase transitions , a divergent susceptibility and a power - law decay of correlations should be observed near the qcd critical point .",
    "indeed , lattice qcd calculations have indicated large fluctuations near the qcd critical temperature  @xcite@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2_1_01 ] shows quadratic ( @xmath39 ) and quartic ( @xmath40 ) derivatives of the qcd partition function with respect to baryon number , electric charge , and strangeness chemical potentials in terms of the system temperature .",
    "experimentally , the divergence of susceptibility and increased fluctuations can be related to event - by - event fluctuations of a given observable .",
    "for example , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath41 fluctuations could be related to strangeness fluctuations , baryon number fluctuations and baryon - strangeness correlations  @xcite at mid - rapidity .",
    "the advantage of a ratio fluctuation is that the volume fluctuation cancels out .",
    "one such observable , @xmath42  @xcite , is defined as the difference of measured fluctuations between real data and mixed events .",
    "@xmath43    here @xmath44 is the relative width ( standard deviation divided by the mean ) of the event - by - event particle - ratio distribution ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath41 ) calculated from the data .",
    "@xmath45 is the same relative width calculated from mixed events .",
    "the mixed events are created by taking no more than one track from each real event so that there are no correlations between tracks in mixed events .",
    "the fluctuations of mixed events represents the statistical background within the experimental acceptance .",
    "the subtraction of @xmath45 from @xmath44 removes statistical background and leave us with nonstatistical fluctuations only . due to the definition of our observable , it is possible to have @xmath46 ( for example , decay of @xmath47 will introduce correlations between pions and protons and reduce the width of @xmath1 ratio distribution ) .",
    "we use @xmath48 to extract sign outside of the square root in equation  [ eq : eq_2_1_sigma_dyn ] .",
    "another observable , @xmath49 , is also proposed  @xcite to study the deviation from poisson behavior .",
    "the observable @xmath49 for kaons and pions can be written as    @xmath50    where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the number of charged kaons and charged pions in each event and the brackets represent event averages .",
    "if pions and kaons distribution are poisson and independent of each other , one would expect @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which will provide a zero @xmath56 .",
    "thus , @xmath49 can be used to study the deviation of fluctuations from poisson behavior .",
    "although @xmath49 is calculated in a different way than @xmath42 , it represents that same dynamical fluctuations .",
    "the advantage of @xmath49 is that it does not require the creation of mixed events .",
    "a poisson simulation also shows that @xmath49 provides more stable results compare to @xmath42 if the statistics is limited . with enough statistics and and a sufficiently large denominator",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath57 .",
    "a detailed study can be found in ref.@xcite .      in a typical central collision of two gold nuclei at rhic ,",
    "thousands of particles are produced .",
    "most of these charged particles are created during the dynamical evolution of the hot and dense media . due to local charge conservation",
    ", charges are pair produced close to each other in space and time .",
    "the charged pairs are then pulled apart by diffusion and interactions while the system is expanding .",
    "hence the study of correlations between opposite - sign charge pairs provides a unique tool to probe the properties of the hot dense matter created at rhic .",
    "one such observable , the balance function , is sensitive to the correlation of balancing charges .    in general",
    ", the balance function can be written as  @xcite .",
    "@xmath58    where @xmath59 is the conditional probability of seeing particle @xmath37 in condition @xmath60 given condition that particle @xmath61 is in condition @xmath62 . a like sign subtraction",
    "is applied to study only the balancing charges .",
    "therefore the balance function can be used to study the conditional probability of a particle in condition @xmath62 being accompanied by an opposite - sign charge in condition @xmath60 .",
    "experimentally , the conditional probability @xmath59 can be calculated via    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the number of pairs that satisfy both conditions and @xmath65 is the number of particles in @xmath62 .",
    "a simplified version of balance function refers to @xmath62 as detecting a particle anywhere inside the detector and @xmath60 as having a relative pseudorapidity @xmath6 ( or @xmath8 , @xmath7 , etc . ) with respect to the first particle .",
    "for example , the balance function for @xmath6 can be written as  @xcite .",
    "@xmath66    specifically , @xmath67 denotes the number of charged particle pairs in a given pseudorapidity range @xmath68 , which is calculated by taking in turn each positive particle in an event and incrementing a histogram of @xmath6 with respect to all the negative particles in that event .",
    "the distribution @xmath67 is then summed over all events .",
    "a similar procedure is followed for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "also @xmath72 is the number of positive(negative ) particles integrated over all events .",
    "balance functions are sensitive to the mechanisms of charge formation and the subsequent relative diffusion of the balancing charges @xcite .",
    "the idea is that in heavy ion collisions , most of the final state charges are created during the dynamical evolution of the system , due to local charge conservation , particles and their antiparticles are pair produced , so they are correlated initially in coordinate space .",
    "if hadronization occurs early , the created charge pairs would be expected to separate in rapidity due to expansion and rescattering in the strongly interacting medium . however , if a deconfined system of quarks and gluon is created during the collision , the observed balancing charges are then created when the deconfined system hadronizes , which reduces the effects of expansion and diffusion on the correlation of the balancing charges . the same arguments were used in discussing charge fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the narrowing of the balance function in central collisions implies high degree of correlation in coordinate space .",
    "this has been postulated as a signal for delayed hadronization @xcite , which would not allow charges the opportunity to separate in coordinate space .",
    "balance functions are also affected by the freeze - out temperature and by radial flow @xcite .",
    "remarkably , balance functions for central collisions have been shown to be consistent with blast - wave models where the balancing charges are required to come from regions with identical collective flow @xcite .",
    "it has been previously presented that balance functions from au+au collisions at @xmath3 = 130 gev for all charged particles and for identified charged pions @xcite narrow in central au+au collisions . in the following chapter",
    "we discuss further studies at additional incident energies .",
    "the width of the balance function can be used to gain insight into the correlation between balancing charge pairs .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite made the point that the observed width of the balance function in terms of relative rapidity , @xmath73 , is a combination of the rapidity spread induced by thermal effects , @xmath74 , and the separation of the balancing partners of the charge / anti - charge pair in coordinate space .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite stated this relationship as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is a diffusion constant , @xmath77 is the proper time after the initial collision when the charge / anti - charge pair is created , and @xmath78 is a characteristic time on the order of 1 fm/@xmath35 . after the initial collision",
    ", the width of the balance function decreases because the thermal width narrows as a result of cooling , while diffusion tends to increase the width of the balance function .",
    "if production of the charge / anti - charge pairs occurs at early times , then scattering and expansion affects the partners of the charge / anti - charge pair during the entire lifetime of the system .",
    "the diffusion term is then large and significantly broadens the observed balance function .",
    "if the production of charge / anti - charge pairs occurs late , the time during which the partners of the charge / anti - charge pair are exposed to scattering and expansion is small , which makes the effect of diffusion negligible .",
    "thus , in the case of late production of the charge / anti - charge pairs , the width of the balance function is determined by the thermal width .      due to the difficulty of lattice qcd calculations ,",
    "semi - classical models have been generally applied as tools to investigate the collision dynamics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "two major types of models , hydrodynamical / statistical models and microscopic transport models , are used in this paper .",
    "hydrodynamical models start from the very basic physical principles of energy and momentum conservation  @xcite .",
    "a typical hydrodynamical model assumes local thermal equilibrium and neglects viscosity .",
    "initial conditions are provided by outside sources .",
    "once the initial conditions and the equation of state ( eos ) are known , the expansion of the fluid is determined by hydrodynamic equations .",
    "as the system expands , at some point , the energy density become so low that local thermal equilibrium can no longer be maintained .",
    "that is the point where the hydrodynamic evolution is stopped .",
    "the freeze - out prescription are then calculated through other methods like transport models .    at the end of expansion ,",
    "hydrodynamical quantities are then linked to other methods to generate the final state observables .    unlike hydrodynamical models that require input about initial and final state interactions ,",
    "transport models deal with the entire time evolution of the heavy - ion collisions by modeling its microscopic constituents and their interactions .",
    "most transport models are based on quantum molecular dynamics or solutions of the boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) .",
    "the system s degrees of freedom are chosen to be baryons and mesons in the case of hadronic transport models or quarks and gluons in the case of parton cascades .",
    "because microscopic transport models do nt assume local thermal equilibrium , they are useful for the study of fluctuations and equilibration mechanisms .",
    "the ultra - relativistic quantum - molecular - dynamics ( urqmd ) model is a microscopic model used to simulate @xmath5 , @xmath79+a and a+a interactions at relativistic energies ranging from bevalac and sis energies ( 1 agev ) up to the alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) ( 10 agev ) , the super proton synchroton ( sps ) ( 160 agev ) and rhic  @xcite",

    "more sub - hadronic degrees of freedom are introduced by the introduction of a formation time for hadrons produced in the fragmentation of strings and by hard ( pqcd ) scattering via the pythia model  @xcite .",
    "the urqmd model is a hadronic transport model that does not incorporate a phase transition from hadronic matter to deconfined quark - gluon matter .    throughout this paper ,",
    "the urqmd model is used as a hadronic reference for comparison with experimental data .",

    "a conventional single - particle blast wave model assumes that particles are locally thermalized at a kinetic freeze - out temperature and are moving with a common collective transverse radial flow velocity field .",
    "the system can be described as  @xcite    @xmath82    where the parameters are the freeze - out surface characteristic function @xmath83 , the collective velocity @xmath84 and the kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath85 .",

    "we observe that the width of the balance function @xmath145 shows little dependence on centrality for au+au collisions at @xmath3 = 200 gev .",
    "this lack of dependence on centrality may indicate that strangeness is created early in the collision rather than in a later hadronization stage .",
    "the fact that the width of the balance function for charged kaons in terms of @xmath7 is independent of centrality was verified by removing @xmath119 decays using high statistics data .    for both pions and kaons , the width of the balance function in terms of @xmath9 decreases with increasing centrality .",
    "this narrowing may be affected by the evolution of the kinetic freeze - out temperature with centrality .",

    "a comparison with a blast - wave model @xcite suggests that the balance function @xmath145 for pion pairs in central au+au collisions at @xmath3 = 200 gev is as narrow as one could expect , as the model assumes that the balancing charges are perfectly correlated in coordinate space at breakup .",
    "this correlation might be explained either by having the charges created late in the reaction , thus denying them the opportunity to separate in coordinate space , or having them created early , but maintaining their close proximity through very limited diffusion . whereas the first explanation is motivated by a picture of delayed hadronization ,",
    "the idea of limited diffusion is consistent with the matter having a very small viscosity , which also requires a small mean free path .",
    "both these explanations account for the observation that the balance function narrows with centrality , since the breakup temperature , which determines the width , falls with increasing centrality . the additional information provided here concerning the decomposition of the balance function into @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath10",
    "may provide the basis for a more stringent test of competing theoretical pictures .",
