    "the possibility that there exists more than three spatial dimensions in nature has aroused physicists interests for many years .",
    "recently , the studying focus of theories about extra dimensions has shifted to the brane worldscenario .",
    "in contrast to the original string / superstring theories in which extra dimensions are assumed to be as small as planck scale ( @xmath0 ) and hence the detection of these tiny dimensions is hopeless , extra dimensions in brane world scenario can be large or even infinite ( for a review , see e.g. , @xcite ) , so that the search for such hidden dimensions becomes much more encouraging .    among various brane world models ,",
    "the one proposed by add ( n. arkani - hamed , s. dimopoulos and g. dvali ) is especially interesting @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and its implications in accelerator physics , astrophysics and cosmology have been widely studied ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps the most distinctive character of this model is it predicts that the familiar newton s inverse - square law ( isl ) would fail below the size of extra dimensions .",
    "the reason is as follows : to solve the hierarchy problem in particle physics , that is , the unnatural huge energy gap between planck mass @xmath1 and electroweak mass @xmath2 , add assume the four dimensional @xmath3 is not a fundamental scale , but an induced one from the @xmath4 dimensional planck mass @xmath5 through @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the number and radius of the extra dimensions respectively . for @xmath9 , this equation is equivalent to @xmath10 they further assume @xmath5 is around the scale of @xmath11 , then the hierarchy becomes trivial .",
    "considering within brane world scenario gravitational field ( with possible exception of some hypothetic very weakly coupled fields ) is the only field that can propagate in extra dimensions , a straightforward use of @xmath4 dimensional gauss law infers that the usual isl of gravitational force would change to a much stronger one at small scale as @xmath12 and it recovers to ordinary isl for @xmath13 .",
    "while the @xmath14 case , for which @xmath15 from eq.([eq2 ] ) , is excluded from planetary motion observations , other possibilities of @xmath7 can not be boldly ruled out .",
    "particularly , the @xmath16 case implies sub - millimeter extra dimensions , while the experimental conditions for testing newton s isl by torsion pendulum method was just about to be available when add s proposal appeared , therefore , many people have devoted to the search of deviation from isl as well as extra dimensions during the past few years @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . by now , there is no reported deviation from isl and the parameter @xmath5 has been constrained to larger than several @xmath17 by torsion - balance experiments ( @xcite , @xcite , including also constraints from accelerators and astrophysics etc . ) .",
    "notice that eq.([eq2 ] ) results in smaller @xmath8 for larger @xmath7 . for @xmath18 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath19 .",
    "direct measurement of gravitational force using torsion pendulum at such small scale is far beyond the reach of current and foreseeable future experimental ability .",
    "( note , however , that the scales of different extra dimensions are not guaranteed to be the same , so the deviation from isl may also appear in micron range even for @xmath20 . )",
    "considering the limitation of torsion - balance experiments and the importance of detection of the possible deviation from isl as well as exploring extra dimensions , searching for other alternative experimental methods is worthwhile .",
    "it is well know that spectroscopy is one of the most precise and thoroughly studied fields in physics , so we wonder whether clues about deviation from isl and extra dimensions can be found in such field .",
    "the idea is quite simple : since gravity may become much stronger at small scale , then for small scale systems , such as atoms , ions and even subatoms , effects of the original safely neglected gravity may actually be large enough and able to show itself in spectroscopic spectra .",
    "because of the precision of spectroscopy , such experiments may help to set constraints of @xmath5 and @xmath8 , or some other model depended parameters .",
    "moreover , these spectroscopic experiments may be capable of dealing with the @xmath18 case and detect the possible deviation from isl down to nanometer range .    in a previous paper @xcite , we did some calculations based on one - proton one - lepton systems , that is , hydrogen atom , muonic hydrogen etc . , and found that the corrections from the strengthened gravity for the ground state binding energy of these systems are many orders of magnitude larger than the ones from the exact isl gravity .",
    "now we would like further develop our work to high - z hydrogenic systems ( one electron ) and muonic atoms , which are particular interesting in precision spectroscopy since their important role in testing quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of gravity in such systems are much larger and hence may be more encouraging for our proposal . in this sense , these systems may be not only suitable to test the standard model of particle physics , but also help to explore scenarios beyond the standard model .",
    "even within add s framework where gravity becomes much stronger at small scale , gravity is still far smaller compared to electromagnetic force in high - z hydrogenic systems , so we can conveniently treat it as a perturbation . also , for estimating gravity effects from the view of orders of magnitude , we just need to consider corrections from the leading schrodinger term .    as an illustration",
    ", we will only perform calculations for the ground state energy level , which is also the simplest case .",
    "clearly , correction in this energy level is the largest one because of the smallest bohr radius , which serves as the mean distance between the gravitational sources  the atomic nucleus and the electron .",
    "the first - order correction of the ground state energy level is written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the ground state wave function of the high - z hydrogenic system , @xmath23 is the first bohr radius , @xmath24 is the reduced mass , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the masses of electron and atomic nucleus respectively .",
    "the gravitational potential is given as @xmath27 where the @xmath4 dimensional newton s constant is @xmath28 , and the four dimensional newton s constant is @xmath29 .",
    "the second line of eq.([eq5 ] ) takes the yukawa type , in which the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in above expressions , we have neglected constants of order unity which depends on the specific compactification forms of extra dimensions , and we have assumed that the sizes of all the extra dimensions are the same .",
    "more detail expressions can be seen in @xcite , @xcite .    from eq.([eq4 ] ) and the first line of eq.([eq5 ] ) , one can notice that the integral diverges as @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "considering the atomic nucleus is not point like , we introduces a safe cutoff value @xmath34 with the atomic nucleus size for the lower limit of the integral .",
    "a convenient expression of @xmath34 is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the mass number of the atomic nucleus and @xmath37 is of size @xmath38 .",
    "also note that such cutoff leads to a relatively conservative estimation of the gravity effects .    neglecting coefficients of order unity ,",
    "the above equations give @xmath39 since @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 , then for @xmath43 , the corrections are much smaller than the ones for @xmath16 and @xmath18 , which are the cases of our interest .    in fact , for @xmath16 and @xmath18 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the corrections for high - z hydrogenic systems are much larger compared to the ones for hydrogen atom .",
    "convert @xmath46 to corrections in terms of frequency @xmath47 through @xmath48 . for a specific system ,",
    "say @xmath49pb@xmath50 , @xmath51 for @xmath16 and @xmath52 for @xmath18 , while the corresponding corrections in hydrogen atom are @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively . also note that the exact isl , that is , the @xmath55 case gives a correction as small as @xmath56 for hydrogen atom .",
    "the above calculations also suit to muonic atoms ( one muon in the atoms or ions , not confined to hydrogen - like ) , since the ground state muonic orbit is far interior compare to the first electronic bohr orbit and hence the muon sees approximately a pure coulomb potential from the atomic nucleus . in this case , what we need to do is just assigning @xmath25 in eq.([eq6 ] ) the mass of muon , which is about @xmath57 times larger than electron .",
    "notice @xmath25 also appears in the expression of @xmath58 , such substitution further results in several orders of magnitude increase of @xmath47 . for @xmath49pb muonic atom ,",
    "@xmath59 for @xmath16 and @xmath60 for @xmath18 . for a medium - z muonic atom , e.g. , @xmath61ca muonic atom , @xmath62 for @xmath16 and @xmath63 for @xmath18 .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath47 to @xmath5 and the corresponding @xmath8 ( notice eq.([eq1 ] ) ) is easily seen from eq.([eq6 ] ) , since @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath16 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "[ f1 ] show the @xmath61ca muonic atom case for @xmath16 , and fig .",
    "[ f2 ] show the @xmath49pb muonic atom case for @xmath18 .",
    "to @xmath5 for @xmath61ca muonic atom , @xmath16.,width=384 ]     to @xmath5 for @xmath49pb muonic atom , @xmath18.,width=384 ]",
    "considering the above large corrections from gravitational effects , it appears spectroscopic experiments using high - z hydrogenic systems and medium - z or high - z muonic atoms may serve as new methods to detect the possible deviation of newton s isl as well as to search for extra dimensions .",
    "the high precision x - ray and laser spectroscopy make this proposal interesting , since the relevant experiments may not only be able to explore the @xmath16 case in add s brane world model , but also make the study of @xmath18 case and nanometer range deviation possible .",
    "also , the strong dependence of the corrections to fundamental parameters of the model , e.g. , the scales of extra dimensions , may help to further constrain such parameters .",
    "we note , however , great efforts may have to be made before the realization of our proposal . theoretically , the uncertainties of the nuclear structure effects , the higher - order terms neglected in calculation of other effects etc . , may submerge the effects of gravity . experimentally , to achieve enough accuracy to show the strengthened gravity effects is also challenging ( for a review about experimental accuracy for lyman-@xmath66 transitions in high - z hydrogenic systems , see @xcite ) .    anyway , although difficulties exist , it is fair to say that in precision spectroscopy , similar ideas may find their way in many other systems , e.g. , subatomic and sub - nuclear systems , and by various experiments , e.g. , experiments involving hyperfine structures . in a word , precision spectroscopy may play an active role in the development of the most exotic theories of particle physics and cosmology , and it may really help to explore those most exotic mysteries like extra dimensions .",
