    "consider the cauchy problem for the schrdinger equation @xmath0 with @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "several estimates have been obtained for the solution @xmath3 of in terms of lebesgue spaces , with important applications to wellposedness and scattering theory for nonlinear schrdinger equations , possibly with potentials @xcite . among them",
    ", we recall the important fixed - time estimates @xmath4 as well as the homogeneous strichartz estimates : for @xmath5 , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , i.e. , for @xmath9 _ schrdinger admissible _",
    ", @xmath10 where , as usual , @xmath11 as a matter of fact , these estimates express a gain of local @xmath12-regularity of the solution @xmath13 , and a decay of its @xmath14 norm , both in some @xmath15-averaged sense .",
    "recently several authors ( @xcite ) have turned their attention to fixed - time and space - time estimates of the schrdinger propagator between spaces widely used in time - frequency analysis @xcite , known as modulation spaces and wiener amalgam spaces .",
    "these spaces were first introduced by h. feichtinger in @xcite ( now available in textbooks @xcite ) and have recently become very popular in the framework of signal analysis . loosely speaking , given a banach space @xmath16 , like @xmath17 or @xmath18 , the wiener amalgam space @xmath19 consists of functions which are locally in @xmath16 but display an @xmath20-decay at infinity .",
    "in particular , @xmath21 , @xmath22 if @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 if @xmath26 , @xmath24 .    as explained in @xcite , one of the main motivations for considering estimates in these spaces",
    "is that they control the local regularity of a function and its decay at infinity separately .",
    "hence , they highlight and distinguish between the local properties and the global behaviour of the solution @xmath27 and therefore , as far as strichartz estimates concern , they are natural candidates to perform an analysis of the solution which is finer than the classical one . actually , wiener amalgam spaces have already appeared as technical tool in pde s . in particular , the space @xmath28 coincides with the space @xmath29 introduced in @xcite .",
    "some stricharz estimates in this environment are in @xcite , where the following fixed - time estimates are presented : for @xmath30 , @xmath31 the related homogeneous strichartz estimates , obtained by combining with orthogonality arguments , read @xmath32 for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , with @xmath35 . when @xmath36 the same estimate holds with the lorentz space @xmath37 in place of @xmath38 .",
    "dual homogeneous and retarded estimates hold as well .    for comparison",
    ", the classical estimates can be rephrased in terms of wiener amalgam spaces as follows : @xmath39 thereby , the new estimates contain the following insight : the classical estimates can be modified by ( conveniently ) moving local regularity from the time variable to the space variable .",
    "indeed , @xmath40 if @xmath41 , but the bound in is worse than the one in , as @xmath42 ; consequently , in the estimate we average locally in time by the @xmath43 norm , which is rougher than the @xmath20 norm in or , equivalently , in .    in the present paper",
    "we perform the converse approach , by showing that it is possible to move local regularity in from the space variable to the time variable . as a result",
    ", we obtain new estimates involving the wiener amalgam spaces @xmath28 that generalize .",
    "this requires some preliminary steps .",
    "first , we show that can be enlarged to more general pairs @xmath44 , rather than only conjugate - exponent pairs @xmath45 , ( see theorem ) .",
    "in particular , if we choose @xmath46 , the related fixed - time estimates read @xmath47 using techniques similar to @xcite , the related strichartz estimates are achieved in theorem [ prima2 ] .",
    "finally , the complex interpolation with the classical estimates yields our main result :    [ prima2i ] let @xmath48 , @xmath49 such that @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 , @xmath54 and , if @xmath55 , @xmath56 . the same for @xmath57 .",
    "then , we have the homogeneous strichartz estimates @xmath58 the dual homogeneous strichartz estimates @xmath59 and the retarded strichartz estimates @xmath60    figure 1 illustrates the range of exponents for the homogeneous estimates when @xmath61 .",
    "notice that , if @xmath24 , these estimates follow immediately from and the inclusion relations of wiener amalgam spaces recalled above .",
    "so , the issue consists in the cases @xmath62 .",
    "+ @xmath63    figure 1 : when @xmath61 , holds for all pairs @xmath64 , @xmath65 , with @xmath66 .    since there are no relations between the pairs @xmath67 and @xmath68 other than @xmath69 , these estimates tell us , in a sense , that the analysis of the local regularity of the schrdinger propagator is quite independent of its decay at infinity .",
    "we then discuss the sharpness of the results above , as well as those in @xcite .",
    "indeed , in section [ necessarie ] we first focus on the fixed - time estimates , proving that the range @xmath41 in is sharp , and the same for the decay @xmath70 at infinity , and the bound @xmath71 , when @xmath72 .",
    "then , we present the sharpness of the strichartz estimates , except for the threshold @xmath73 , which seems quite hard to obtain .",
    "next , we turn our attention to the new estimates in theorem [ prima2i ] and show that , for @xmath61 , all the constraints on the range of exponents in theorem [ prima2i ] are necessary , except for @xmath69 , @xmath74 , which remain an open problem . however , we prove the weaker result ( proposition [ pd1 ] ) :    _ assume @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    ". then the propagator @xmath77 does not map @xmath78 continuously into @xmath79 .",
    "_    this shows that estimates for exponents @xmath75 , if true , can not be obtained from fixed - time estimates and orthogonality arguments .",
    "the arguments here employed for the necessary conditions differ from the classical setting of lebesgue spaces , where necessary conditions are usually obtained by general scaling considerations ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercises 2.35 , 3.42 ) , and @xcite for the interpretation in terms of gaussian curvature of the characteristic manifold ) . in our framework",
    "this method does not work directly .",
    "indeed , the known bounds for the norm of the dilation operator @xmath80 between wiener amalgam spaces ( @xcite ) , yield constraints which are weaker than the desired ones .    our idea is to consider families of rescaled gaussians as initial data , for which the action of the operator @xmath77 and the involved norms can be computed explicitly .    in the last section , we present an application to the linear schrdinger equation with time - dependent potential ( see @xcite and the references therein for the existent literature ) .",
    "our result extends that in @xcite to the dimension @xmath81 ( instead of @xmath82 ) and to potentials @xmath83 in wiener amalgam spaces rather than the classical @xmath84 spaces .",
