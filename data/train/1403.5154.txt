    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) provide unique insights into both the supernova ( sn ) explosion that generated them and the ambient medium that surrounded their progenitors at the time of the explosion .",
    "unfortunately , the complex physical processes involved in the interaction between ejecta and ambient medium often blur this information , to the point that the explosion type ( i.e. , type ia or core - collapse : ia and cc hereafter ) of several well - studied snrs still remains controversial .    the x - ray emission from young and middle - aged snrs is ideally suited to disentangle the contributions from the sn explosion and circumstellar interaction ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "their thermal x - ray spectra are often dominated by strong optically - thin emission lines from ejecta that retain the nucleosynthetic signature of their birth events . on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray emitting plasma is in a state of non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) , and its time - dependent ionization degree is controlled by the ambient medium density , which is a sensitive diagnostic of the presence of circumstellar material ( csm ) left behind by the sn progenitor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , much progress has been made in the typing of snrs using their x - ray emission . using _",
    "data , @xcite showed that it is possible to distinguish ia remnants from cc ones by virtue of their ejecta composition ; fe - rich and o - poor snrs are likely ia , while snrs dominated by o and ne lines with weak fe l emission are likely cc .",
    "more recently , @xcite argued that _",
    "_ images of ia snrs show a higher degree of symmetry than those of cc snrs .",
    "this result implies that cc sne are more asymmetric than ia sne , and/or cc snrs expand into more asymmetric csm .",
    "these methods are promising , but require sophisticated analysis techniques whose results might lead to ambiguous interpretations .",
    "abundance determination in nei plasmas is notoriously uncertain ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) , and neither of these methods easily leads to placement of quantitative constraints on the presence of csm in a snr . in this _ letter _ , we present a new , straightforward observational diagnostic for typing snrs in x - rays that relies only on the centroid and flux of a single spectral line  the fe k@xmath0 emission at 6.46.7kev .    the fe k line blend is well separated from emission lines of other abundant elements . since the production of fe occurs at the heart of an sn explosion , reverse shock heating of this element",
    "can be delayed compared to elements synthesized in the outer layers .",
    "this often results in an ionization state lower than he - like ( fe@xmath1 ) in young or middle - aged snrs .",
    "the ionization state in turn determines the fe k@xmath0 centroid ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is easily measured using current ccd instruments .",
    "furthermore , the fe k emission is largely unaffected by foreground extinction , unlike fe l - shell blends .",
    "these spectral advantages and simplicities make our method more straightforward than the existing ones , and especially attractive for current and future x - ray missions with high throughput , like _ suzaku _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ astro - h_. here we show that the fe k@xmath0 centroids ( hence the fe ionization state ) clearly discriminate the progenitor type and place strong limits on the presence of csm in snrs at radii of several parsecs , which has important consequences for sn progenitor studies .",

    "the only exception was ic443 , which because of its large angular size was only partially imaged by the xis .",
    "for this snr , we extracted the spectrum from a @xmath59-diameter circular region in the brightest northern part , and estimated the fe k@xmath0 flux from the whole snr by scaling the surface brightness using archival _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "background subtraction was performed in the following manner : ( 1 ) if nearby blank sky data with taken using an identical detector operating mode were available , we used them to extract a background spectrum from the same detector region as the source .",
    "( 2 ) if the snr angular size is small enough ( @xmath60 ) compared with the xis field of view , background data were taken from the surrounding region .",
    "( 3 ) otherwise , we subtracted only the instrumental background component ( nxb ; simulated by the xisnxbgen task ) , and included models for the extragalactic background ( a.k.a .",
    "cxb ) and galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) in our analysis . to estimate the grxe flux",
    ", we followed the relationship between surface brightness and galactic coordinates described by @xcite .",
    "as a consistency check , we applied method ( 3 ) to all the snrs which satisfied the criteria for methods ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , and found no significant change in the measured fe k@xmath0 blend parameters .",
    "we detected fe k@xmath0  emission from the 23 snrs listed in table[tab ] , including five first detections : g337.20.7 , ic443 , g292.0 + 1.8 , n49 , and n63a .",
    "snrs without detectable fe k@xmath0  emission can be categorized in two groups : evolved snrs whose electron temperature is too low ( @xmath61kev ) to excite k - shell transitions in fe atoms , and young snrs where the hard x - ray spectrum is dominated by a strong nonthermal continuum .",
    "the former category includes most interstellar medium - dominated snrs ( e.g. , cygnus loop , g156.2 + 5.7 , deml71 ) , while the latter includes both shell - like snrs with cosmic - ray - accelerating blast waves ( e.g. , g1.9 + 0.3 , rxj1713.73946 ) and plerionic snrs ( e.g. , crab , g21.5 - 0.9 ) .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations of g1.9 + 0.3 separated spatially the thermal emission from the nonthermal continuum , and enabled the detection of fe k@xmath0  emission @xcite .",
    "although _ suzaku _ observed this snr for @xmath28100ks , the fe k@xmath0  emission was not spatially resolved and remained undetected .",
    "a few snrs located near the galactic plane ( e.g. , g272.23.2 , kes27 ) showed hints of fe k@xmath0  emission in their nxb - subtracted spectra , but the fluxes were not significantly larger than those predicted for the grxe background , so we excluded them from our study .",
    "we fitted the 510kev spectrum of each snr with a power - law ( or bremsstrahlung ) continuum plus a gaussian for fe k@xmath0  emission .",
    "foreground absorption columns are given in table[tab ] .",
    "some snrs show emission from cr , mn , and/or ni , and higher transition series of fe k emission , which were modeled using additional gaussians . a radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) of fexxv",
    "was detected in w49b and ic443 .",
    "we modeled this component with an exponential function with a threshold energy of 8.8kev ( corresponding to the ionization potential of fe@xmath1 , following @xcite .",
    "this is the first detection of the fe rrc from ic443 , indicating that fe atoms in this remnant are significantly overionized , similar to si and s @xcite .",
    "the result is presented in more detail in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "we list the measured centroid energy and unabsorbed flux of the fe k@xmath0 blend for each snr in table[tab ] .",
    "figure[plot ] shows the fe k@xmath0 centroid energy and line luminosity for each snr , together with the corresponding effective charge state @xmath62@xmath63@xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the line luminosities were calculated from the derived unabsorbed fluxes using the distances given in table[tab ] . the uncertainty in distance to the galactic snrs",
    "is assumed to be @xmath6510% of the mean values .",
    "although some sources have larger uncertainties ( e.g. , g349.7 + 0.2 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fundamental result is not affected , since the line centroids play a more important role than the luminosities in typing snrs as described below . also shown in figure[plot ] are theoretical predictions for snr models derived from chandrasekhar - mass type ia sn ejecta profiles evolving in a uniform ambient medium density in the range of @xmath66g@xmath67 for snr ages of up to 5000yrs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details on the models ) .",
    "the ejecta profiles shown include three delayed detonation explosion models spanning the nominal range of sn ia kinetic energies and @xmath68ni yields ( ddta , ddtc , and ddtg ) , and two pulsating delayed detonation explosions ( pdda and pddc ) .",
    "the predicted fe k@xmath0 centroids and luminosities are calculated using updated atomic data @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of collisionless electron heating at the reverse shock is set so that the electron - to - ion temperature ratio is 0.010.03 at the immediate post - shock region @xcite .",
    "similar models for cc snrs are not available in the literature , but the ia snr models and the distribution of the data points in figure[plot ] allow us to make a number of important interpretations using our snr sample .",
    "first , all _ bona fide _ ia snrs have an fe k@xmath0  centroid of @xmath696550kev ( @xmath62@xmath63@xmath64 @xmath69 20 ) , while all _ bona fide _ cc snrs have a higher centroid energy .",
    "the separation is very clear : no single object with a robust progenitor type ( i.e. , from a known association to a compact object , or light echo spectroscopy , or detailed modeling of the ejecta emission ) falls on the wrong side of the centroid boundary .",
    "since the ia and cc snrs in our sample have similar ages and radii , this large difference in the ionization state must be due to significantly higher ambient medium densities in the cc snrs .",
    "this is in line with the expectations from stellar evolution models , which predict significant ( several @xmath70 ) mass loss from cc sn progenitors , either due to winds or binary evolution @xcite . in any case , the clear division in fe k@xmath0  centroid allows us to firmly establish the classification of several objects with unclear or controversial types .",
    "both rcw86 and g344.70.1 were once considered to be cc snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but recent observations have suggested a ia origin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter is supported by our study .",
    "the fe k@xmath0  centroid of the ia snr g337.20.7 @xcite falls a bit outside the range of our theoretical models , but this is not surprising given the estimated age ( 50007000yr ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the highly absorbed snr g352.70.1 might have been a cc event , but its fe k@xmath0  centroid puts it squarely in the ia region .",
    "the fe k@xmath0  centroid for g1.9 + 0.3 reported by @xcite also falls within the ia region , supporting the typing of this snr by @xcite . likewise , several snrs suspected to be of a cc origin without confirmed associations with compact objects ( e.g. , g0.61 + 0.01 : @xcite ; n49 : @xcite ; n63a : @xcite ; n132d : @xcite ) fall clearly in the cc region due to their high centroid energies . from the fe k@xmath0  centroid alone , the classification for 3c397 and",
    "n103b is somewhat unclear .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the observed fe k@xmath0  parameters of both snrs can be well reproduced by our ia snr models .",
    "if 3c397 is indeed a type ia remnant ( as suggested by * ? ?",
    "* ) , it should be relatively old ( @xmath71yr ) and has evolved in a high density interstellar medium ( @xmath72g@xmath67 ) , given the comparison with our model plots .",
    "these values are consistent with the estimates of @xcite , although a cc origin was suggested in their work .",
    "the explosion type of n103b has also been a matter of controversy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we favor the ia hypothesis , based on the high maximum luminosity of its parent explosion inferred from the light echo data @xcite , in addition to the properties of the fe k@xmath0  emission .",
    "second , within each group , the centroids and line luminosities are fairly well correlated , such that snrs with more highly ionized fe tend to have more luminous fe k@xmath0  lines .",
    "this is likely a consequence of the nei characteristics of the emitting plasma ; in order to collisionally ionize fe atoms to higher states , higher post - shock densities are required , which also result in higher emission measures and thus x - ray luminosities .",
    "the snr age also plays a role in the ionization state of the ejecta , but ambient medium density is the main driver , as illustrated by the ia snr models in figure[plot ] . interestingly ,",
    "both snr types span a similar range of fe k@xmath0  luminosities , despite the fact that typical ejected mass of fe ( @xmath68ni ) is an order of magnitude smaller in cc than in ia sne @xcite .",
    "this is again due to the higher emission measure associated with higher post shock density , and is one of the reasons why typing snrs has been difficult without having a detailed model for their dynamics and plasma evolution . in this context ,",
    "the relatively high fe k@xmath0  centroid and luminosity for sn1987a are particularly interesting , given the young age and low ejected fe mass of this snr .",
    "the progenitors of the overionized snrs , w49b and ic443 , might have an especially high mass loss rate , leading to a csm dense enough to produce a strong circumstellar interaction in the early evolutionary phase of their remnants ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    finally , although our ia snr models are relatively simplistic ( one - dimensional hydrodynamics in uniform ambient density ) , the parameter space they span includes _ all _ ia snrs .",
    "this is remarkable in its own right , because some ia snrs , like kepler @xcite and n103b @xcite , are known to be interacting with a nonuniform ambient medium .",
    "our analysis does not rule out the presence of csm in these objects , but simply indicates that deviations from a uniform ambient medium in ia snrs , if present , can not be very large , and rules out large csm masses ( several @xmath70 ) as seen in cc snrs .",
    "middle - aged ia snrs with low fe k@xmath0  centroids and luminosities might be interacting with an exceptionally low density interstellar medium ( e.g. , sn1006 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or with a low - density wind - blown cavity excavated by the progenitor ( e.g. , rcw86 : * ? ? ?",
    ". on the other hand , young ia snrs with higher fe k@xmath0  centroids and luminosities , like n103b @xcite , might be interacting with some kind of csm , but their fe k@xmath0  emission can also be explained by uniform ambient density models , at least at the level of detail allowed by our study .",
    "we have presented a systematic analysis of fe k@xmath0  emission from 23 galactic and lmc snrs observed by _",
    "suzaku_. we find that the fe k@xmath0  line luminosities of type ia and cc snrs are distributed in a similar range ( @xmath73 = @xmath74photonss@xmath8 ) , but the fe k@xmath0  centroid energies clearly distinguish ia from cc snrs , with the former always having centroids below @xmath286.55kev and the latter always above .",
    "we interpret this separation as a signature of different mass - loss rates in ia and cc sn progenitors .",
    "the fe k@xmath0  emission of all the ia objects in our sample is compatible with snr models that expand into a uniform ambient medium , which suggests that ia progenitors do not modify their surroundings as strongly as cc progenitors do .",
    "this is in line with known limits from prompt x - ray @xcite and radio @xcite emission from ia sne , but our results probe a different regime , constraining the structure of the csm to larger radii ( several pc ) and progenitor mass loss rates further back in the pre - sn evolution of the progenitor .",
    "a quantification of these constraints and a more detailed analysis of the cc snr sample are left for future work .",
    "the full potential of our method will be realized when it is applied to larger samples of higher quality data , as will be accessible to high resolution spectrometers like those on _ astro - h _ and other future missions with large effective areas in the fe k@xmath0  band like _",
    "these instruments will open the possibility of studying statistically significant samples of x - ray emitting snrs in nearby galaxies with resolved stellar populations like m31 , which will in turn dramatically increase our knowledge of both type ia and cc sn progenitors .",
