    "[ str](b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "it is interesting that both distortion modes are the same as the corresponding ones of the tb1o@xmath11 and tb2o@xmath11 octahedra @xcite , indicating a common feature .",
    "both distortion modes may be ascribed to crystal field anisotropy , which is supported by the observation in srtb@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite that the partially - ordered tb1 moments qualitatively point to the direction of the stress product imposed on the tb1 ion by the tb1o@xmath11 octahedral distortion .",
    "a quantitative understanding of both distortion modes necessitates a theoretical model to simulate the tension state of the @xmath16-o bonds , and a quantitative determination of the detailed crystal field parameters by inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "two explanations are possible for the refined @xmath65 at 2 k ( eq .  [ br ] ) .",
    "firstly , the tm1 and tm2 sites present measurable magnetization , but both sites are nearly half frustrated even in the pm state , and the frustrated spins are in a strong freezing state .",
    "secondly , the measurable magnetization derives from only one of the two tm sites , probably the tm1 site , and the other is frustrated completely even in the pm state at 2 k. although both cases can lead to the slight increase in magnetization from @xmath93 3.6 to @xmath94 6.5 t as shown in fig .",
    "[ m(h ) ] , the later case is more favourable because it resembles the magnetic behaviour of the tb1 and tb2 sites in the magnetically - ordered state of srtb@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , and , most importantly , there is no appreciable magnetic relaxation at 2 k after magnetic field has reached even 9 t. the obvious decrease in the measured magnetization above @xmath5 8.3 t at 2 k in contrast to the theoretical brillouin calculation ( fig .",
    "[ m(h ) ] ) may suggest a zeeman splitting effect on the high - level _ j_-multiplets .",
    "the pm curie temperature of single - crystal srtm@xmath0o@xmath1 is @xmath95 k , however , no evidence of magnetic ordering , even short - ranged , appears down to @xmath5 65 mk in our neutron - diffraction studies .",
    "this implies that there exists an extremely strong magnetic frustration for the tm@xmath10 ions in srtm@xmath0o@xmath1 or the potential magnetic ordering is highly gapped by a strong crystal - field anisotropy . as shown in fig .",
    "[ str](d ) , the nn tm1 or tm2 ions are respectively staggered along the _ c _ axis , while the connections between the nnn tm1 or tm2 ions form ladder - like chains in the same direction .",
    "altogether , the nns and nnns of the tm1 or tm2 ions form isosceles triangles for zigzag chains .",
    "these tm chains are arranged to form bent tm@xmath11 honeycombs ( figs .",
    "[ str](d ) and ( e ) ) . in this crystalline environment ,",
    "the similarity of the nn and nnn spin interactions and the low coordination numbers of the tm ions are believed to cause the geometric frustration of the spin lattice .",
    "in addition , potential stronger and competing tm - tm spin interactions , by virtue of the shorter nn bond length compared to that of the tb - tb ions in srtb@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , may be insufficient to overcome crystal electric field , which therefore leads to a nonmagnetic ordering state .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with those from the pyrochlore compounds of @xmath12ti@xmath0o@xmath14 @xmath15 tm and tb ) . in tm@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath14 ,",
    "magnetic tm@xmath10 ions occupy one of the two corner - sharing tetrahedral sublattices .",
    "the crystal field effect radically dominates over the magnetic exchange interactions so that the ground state is a virtual crystal - field singlet rather than a short - ranged and frustrated magnetic state , and the lowest - lying crystal - field excitations thus do nt show any appreciable dispersion @xcite .",
    "in addition , the magnetic susceptibility of tm@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath14 gets a clear plateau at low temperatures @xcite , whereas that of srtm@xmath0o@xmath1 continuously increases @xcite , implying different origins of the nonmagnetic ordering states of both compounds . although there exists a strong afm interaction based on the value of the curie - weiss temperature ( -19 k ) @xcite , no appreciable long - range magnetic order forms in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath14 even down to 50 mk but short - ranged magnetic order",
    "was indeed observed indicative of a spin - liquid ground state @xcite .",
    "the nature of the magnetic ground state and the reason for the absence of long - ranged spin order of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath14 still remain elusive , which represents a theoretical puzzle and also a real experimental challenge .",
    "our further analysis of the @xmath96-averaged @xcite neutron scattering intensity in the sf ( eq .",
    "[ pol1_aw ] ) and nsf ( eq .  [ pol2_aw ] ) channels indeed indicates the existences of pm neutron scattering and afm coupling in srtm@xmath0o@xmath1 at @xmath5 65 mk .",
    "however , an estimate of the moment size ( eq .  [ pol3_aw ] ) is complicated by the presence of strong nuclear spin - incoherent scattering from the copper support on which the sample was mounted .",
    "future experiments using the @xmath97 polarization method at d7 , which will give a clear separation between nuclear coherent , nuclear spin - incoherent , and magnetic cross - sections @xcite , may be attempted .",
    "our present results provide a more mysterious compound for theorists and experimentalists , srtm@xmath0o@xmath1 , which is different from both srdy@xmath0o@xmath1 and tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath14 due to the absences of both short- and long- ranged magnetic orders .    to summarize",
    ", we have demonstrated that there is no long- or short - ranged magnetic ordering in single - crystal srtm@xmath0o@xmath1 even down to @xmath5 65 mk , though the high - temperature magnetization indicates a strong afm coupling .",
    "this is consistent with the field - dependent magnetization measurements where the data can be adequately fit using a modified brillouin function ( eq .  [ br ] ) for a frustrated pm state .",
    "we argue that the nonmagnetic ordering state is ascribed to a strong anisotropic crystal field effect .",
    "this kind of magnetic anisotropy may gap potential magnetic ordering , leading to a virtual nonmagnetic ordering state .",
    "we also find some common features for both srtm@xmath0o@xmath1 and srtb@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystals : ( i ) the measured magnetization , even in the pm state , is from just one of the two crystallographic @xmath16 sites ; ( ii ) the same octahedral distortion modes as well as their evolutions with temperature ; ( iii ) the spin couplings are dominated by the dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "these common features observed in both compounds may be vital to a complete understanding of the novel magnetic behaviour of sr@xmath12o@xmath1 .",
    "further explorations with higher magnetic fields and uniaxial pressure along the axes , spin - density measurements in the pm state , and especially inelastic neutron - scattering studies , would be of great interest .",
