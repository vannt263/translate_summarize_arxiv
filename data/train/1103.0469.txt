    "critical phenomena are observed in vicinity of phase transition points in a variety of systems ( e.  g. , solids ",
    "ferromagnets , ferroelectrics ; fluids  superfluid @xmath9-transition ; liquid  gas transition , etc . ) , which manifest themselves in power  like singularities of physical observables , described by critical exponents . in many systems , like isotropic ferromagnets (",
    "e.  g. , polycrystalline ni ) , certain singularity is observed not only at the critical temperature @xmath10 , but also at vanishing external field @xmath11 for any temperature @xmath12 .",
    "this phenomenon , known as the goldstone mode singularity , is also described by power  like divergences and certain exponents . in this sense",
    ", it can be viewed as a critical phenomenon , which takes place in vicinity of the critical line @xmath13 in the @xmath14@xmath15 plane .",
    "the vicinity of critical point ( or line ) is not the natural domain of validity of any perturbation theory , therefore one should resort the non  perturbative methods such as    * exact and rigorous analytical solution methods ( transfer matrix methods , combinatorial methods , bethe - ansatz ) , * conformal field theory analysis , * non  perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) analysis , * numerical transfer  matrix calculations , * molecular dynamics simulations , * monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "the exact solutions  @xcite and conformal field analysis  @xcite are powerful tools to determine the critical exponents of two  dimensional models",
    ". however , these approaches are not helpful in most of the three  dimensional cases .",
    "the mc method can be used here .",
    "the exact non  perturbative rg equations are known for various models on fractal lattices ( see , e.  g.  @xcite and references therein ) , and also in four dimensions a rigorous rg analysis has been made ( see e.  g. ,  @xcite ) . in most of other cases , the non  perturbative rg equations provide only approximations , the accuracy of which can not be well controlled ( see , e.  g. ,  @xcite ) . to the contrary , the mc method allows , in principle , to reach any desired accuracy .",
    "besides , it allows to treat much larger systems than the other numerical methods .",
    "it is extremely important in studying critical phenomena .",
    "therefore , the mc method has no real alternative in non  perturbative determination of critical exponents of the three  dimensional systems like lattice spin ( @xmath0 ) models .",
    "the general framework of perturbative methods includes the study of critical point phenomena at @xmath16 , as well as the goldstone mode effects at @xmath12 .",
    "our aim is to verify nonperturbatively the validity of different theoretical perturbative approaches .",
    "hence , the mc test of the goldstone mode singularities is one of the important points here .",
    "we start with the goldstone mode effects , since this case is simpler in the sense that it does not require the determination of the critical temperature @xmath17 , i.  e. , there are less ambiguities as compared to the @xmath16 case .",
    "here we consider such lattice spin models , where the spin is an @xmath18component vector with @xmath19 .",
    "these are called @xmath0 models due to the @xmath0 global rotational symmetry exhibited by the @xmath18vector model in absence of the external field .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath20 of such a model reads @xmath21 where @xmath14 is temperature , measured in energy units , @xmath22 is the spin variable ( @xmath18component vector of unit length ) of the @xmath23th lattice site , @xmath24 is the coupling constant , and @xmath25 is the external field with magnitude @xmath26 .",
    "the summation takes place over all pairs @xmath27 of the nearest neighbors in the lattice .    in the thermodynamic limit @xmath28 below the critical point , i.  e. , at @xmath29 , the magnetization @xmath30 and the fourier ",
    "transformed transverse ( @xmath31 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath32 ) two  point correlation functions exhibit goldstone mode power ",
    "law singularities : @xmath33 according to the standard theory  @xcite , @xmath34 and @xmath35 hold for @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is true in three dimensions .",
    "more nontrivial universal values are expected according to  @xcite , such that @xmath38 hold for @xmath36 .",
    "these relations have been obtained in  @xcite by analyzing self - consistent diagram equations for the correlation functions without cutting the perturbation series .",
    "this approach is based on certain grouping of feynman diagrams introduced in  @xcite , and therefore is called the gfd theory .",
    "mc simulations have been performed  @xcite to test these relations for the @xmath39 and @xmath2 models on the simple cubic lattice .",
    "the theoretical predictions  ( [ eq : pred1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : pred2 ] ) are confirmed by mc simulation results in the 3d @xmath2 model  @xcite , where an estimate @xmath40 has been found for the transverse correlation function . moreover , it has been stated that the behavior of the longitudinal correlation function is well consistent with @xmath41 being about @xmath42 , in agreement with  ( [ eq : pred2 ] ) at @xmath43 being about @xmath44 , but it is not consistent with the standard  theoretical prediction of @xmath45 . according to  ( [ eq : pred3 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath46 in three dimensions .",
    "a reasonable numerical evidence for this relation has been obtained in  @xcite from the susceptibility data , where the mc estimate @xmath47 has been reported for the 3d @xmath1 ( @xmath39 ) model .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath48 according to  ( [ eq : pred3 ] ) .",
    "in vicinity of the phase transition point , various quantities have often power  law singularities , which are described by the critical exponents . for three  dimensional systems ,",
    "exact results are difficult to obtain , and one usually relies on approximate methods .",
    "a review of standard perturbative rg methods applied here can be found , e.  g. , in  @xcite .",
    "the results of the borel  resummation of the perturbation series for the critical exponents , obtained within this approach , are reported in  @xcite .",
    "we will further focus on the monte carlo testing of the theoretical predictions for the 3d ising model , which is a particular case of @xmath49 .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath4 , describing the @xmath50 singularity of the critical correlation function @xmath51 , is of particular interest here .",
    "according to  @xcite , the most accurate theoretical value @xmath52 is obtained from the series at fixed dimension @xmath53 .",
    "the results of the resummation of the @xmath54expansion in  @xcite are @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "if all these estimates are correct within the error bars , then we have @xmath57 .",
    "this estimation fairly well agrees with the value @xmath58 extracted from the finite  size scaling analysis of the mc data within @xmath59 $ ] , reported in  @xcite . we will present the mc results for much larger lattices up to @xmath3 to test the agreement more precisely .",
    "the other relevant here exponents are the correlation length exponent @xmath60 and correction  to  scaling exponent @xmath61 .",
    "the widely accepted values for the 3d ising model are @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "they are in agreement , e.  g. , with the estimates @xmath64 and @xmath65 reported in  @xcite .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : goldstone ] , the alternative theoretical approach , called the gfd theory , provides promising results concerning the goldstone mode singularities . therefore , it is interesting to verify the predictions of this theory also for the critical point singularities . in  @xcite , a set of possible values of the exact critical exponents for the @xmath66 model in two ( @xmath67 ) and three ( @xmath53 ) dimensions has been proposed : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the susceptibility exponent , @xmath70 may have a natural value starting with 1 , and @xmath71 is an integer equal or larger than @xmath72 . other critical exponents can be calculated from these ones , using the known scaling relations .",
    "these values agree with the known exact solutions of the two  dimensional ising model ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) and of the spherical model ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "a prediction has been made also for the 3d ising model , i.  e. , @xmath76 and @xmath8 , corresponding to @xmath73 and @xmath74 , as in the two  dimensional case .",
    "this value of @xmath60 is consistent with the logarithmic singularity of specific heat ( according to @xmath77 ) proposed earlier by tseskis  @xcite .",
    "the exponents @xmath76 and @xmath8 have been later conjectured for the 3d ising model by zhang  @xcite .",
    "the critical exponents @xmath78 and @xmath79 , calculated for the liquid  gas system by bondarev  @xcite , also correspond to  ( [ eq : result ] ) . in this case @xmath80 and @xmath81 hold .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , the equations  ( [ eq : result ] ) are meaningful for positive integer @xmath18 , and we can have @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the case where the order parameter is an @xmath18component vector . the spatial dimensionality @xmath84 might be considered as a continuous parameter in  ( [ eq : result ] ) within @xmath85 . at @xmath49 , the second  order phase transition at a finite temperature",
    "can be expected also for @xmath86 . however , according to the discussion in  @xcite , an analytic extension of  ( [ eq : result ] ) to this region , probably , is only formal and does not correspond to any real system ( fractal lattice ) .    according to  @xcite",
    ", corrections to scaling can be represented by an expansion of correction factor ( amplitude ) in integer powers of @xmath87 and @xmath88 at @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the reduced temperature .",
    "this expansion is simplified , since @xmath91 is an integer number according to  ( [ eq : result ] ) , and @xmath92 holds according to the known scaling relation .",
    "hence , we obtain the expansion in powers of @xmath93 , where @xmath94 . in other words , the correction  to  scaling exponent in the expansions at @xmath89 is @xmath95 , and the corresponding correction  to  scaling exponent in the finite  size  scaling analysis is @xmath96 , if the first expansion coefficient is nonzero . allowing that some of the expansion coefficients are zero ,",
    "we can have @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a positive integer . however , our actual mc data support the most natural choice of @xmath99 for the 3d ising model .",
    "it implies that the expansion coefficients do not vanish in general , but the nontrivial correction terms vanish only in some special cases , as the 2d ising model or the spherical model , where @xmath100 and/or @xmath101 .",
    "according to the numerical transfer matrix calculations in  @xcite , a nontrivial correction to finite ",
    "size scaling with the exponent @xmath102 , probably , exists in the two  point correlation function even in the 2d ising model , although its amplitude is very small here .",
    "the discussed here gfd critical exponents @xmath103 and @xmath8 for @xmath49 seem to be quite incompatible with the mc data of the 3d ising model , if we assume the usual correction  to  scaling exponent @xmath63 .",
    "however , it turns out that our data for large enough sizes are very well consistent even with the set of exponents @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the disagreement of these exponents with those of the perturbative rg method can also be understood based on a critical analysis  @xcite .",
    "we have simulated the 3d ising model on a simple cubic lattice ( at @xmath13 ) , using the iterative method introduced in  @xcite to adjust the coupling @xmath24 to the pseudo - critical coupling @xmath104 , which corresponds to certain value @xmath105 of the quantity @xmath106 , where @xmath70 is the magnetization per spin .",
    "the pseudo - critical coupling @xmath104 tends to the true critical coupling @xmath107 at @xmath28 . by this method",
    ", we estimate the moments of energy @xmath108 and magnetization @xmath70 per spin , i.  e. , @xmath109 for a set of @xmath24 values fluctuating around @xmath104 , and then calculate these mean values and related quantities at any given @xmath24 near @xmath104 by using the taylor series expansion for @xmath110 .",
    "we have evaluated @xmath111 for various lattice sizes @xmath112 and then estimated @xmath107 by fitting these @xmath111 data . besides , we have calculated the susceptibility @xmath113 and the derivative @xmath114 , where @xmath115 , at @xmath116 , as well as at certain estimated critical couplings @xmath107 , in order to make a finite  size scaling analysis of the critical exponents .",
    "this method has been tested and discussed in detail in  @xcite , giving also some data for @xmath117 .",
    "here we have extended the simulation results up to @xmath3 .",
    "a parallel ( openmp ) implementation of the wolff single cluster algorithm has been used in our simulations , combining it with a sophisticated shuffling scheme for generation of a high  quality pseudo  random numbers , as described in  @xcite .",
    "several tests have been made in  @xcite to verify the quality of the pseudo  random numbers .",
    "here we have tested and used also the lagged fibonacci pseudo  random number generator ( prng ) with multiplication operation and the lags @xmath118 , @xmath119 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we have improved it with the standard shuffling scheme  @xcite , using the shuffling box of the size @xmath120 in this case .",
    "although the lagged fibonacci generator with additive operation produces certain correlations in the sequence of pseudo  random numbers , which can be well detected by the directed  random  walk test  @xcite , this defect is practically not observed in the actual multiplicative case .",
    "like in  @xcite , we have verified it by performing such test with @xmath121 trajectories .",
    "good results have been obtained in this test both for the original prng and for the one improved by the shuffling .",
    "it indicates that the multiplicative lagged fibonacci generator works fine in applications with cluster algorithms , as it also has been mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "the simulations of the two largest lattices with @xmath122 and @xmath3 have been performed with the shuffling scheme of  @xcite and partly ( 24 usable iterations from 56 or 54 ones at @xmath122 and @xmath3 , respectively ) also with the improved lagged fibonacci generator . for complete confidence",
    ", we have verified that the simulation results of the two generators agree within the statistical error bars , whereas the final simulated values have been obtained by summarizing the data from both of them .",
    "note that one iteration included @xmath123 mc ( wolff cluster algorithm ) steps at @xmath122 and @xmath124 mc steps at @xmath3 , the mc measurements being performed after each @xmath125 and @xmath126 steps , respectively .",
    "our simulation results for the pseudo - critical coupling @xmath104 , as well as for the corresponding values of @xmath127 and @xmath114 depending on the lattice size @xmath112 are given in tab .",
