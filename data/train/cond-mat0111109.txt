    "the response of a superconductor to defects and/or impurities brings important informations on the nature of the superconducting state and has been the subject of an enormous amount of theoretical and experimental research.@xcite the effect of impurities on the superconducting state depends crucially on the nature of the impurity ( magnetic or non - magnetic ) and on the symmetry of the order parameter . for isotropic",
    "@xmath0-wave superconductors , the response to a non - magnetic impurity is feeble,@xcite while the effect of a magnetic one is dramatic.@xcite instead when the order parameter is anisotropic , like in @xmath1-wave high-@xmath3 superconductor , the response to disorder is always dramatic,@xcite leading to kondo - like effects in case of magnetic scattering potentials,@xcite or resonant behaviors for non - magnetic impurities close to the unitary limit.@xcite for high-@xmath3 superconductors therefore it is experimentally more difficult to establish whether the impurity acts effectively as a magnetic or a non - magnetic scattering potential . for example , recent scanning tunneling microscope images of the local tunneling conductivity around a zn impurity in bi2212,@xcite have been fitted by both non - magnetic@xcite and magnetic impurity models.@xcite    a topic which could be helpful to clarify the effective nature of disorder in high-@xmath3 oxides is the analysis of the response to some external applied perturbation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show some important consequences of having strong non - magnetic impurities on the zeeman response of a @xmath0- or @xmath1-wave superconductor .",
    "the way in which non - magnetic scattering centers affect the spin degrees of freedom is via the associated spin - orbit interaction as described by the so - called elliott - yafet theory@xcite hence , if @xmath4 is the non - magnetic impurity potential,@xcite the corresponding spin - orbit scattering is proportional to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the shift of the @xmath7-factor .",
    "the actual value of @xmath6 depends on the wave function penetration into the ions and the fermi surface topology and it is a rather difficult problem.@xcite for copper - oxides the main contribution to @xmath6 should come from the @xmath1 orbital of cu atoms for which @xmath8 . within the born approximation ,",
    "the spin - orbit scattering rate in the normal state is therefore @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the scattering rate due to @xmath4 alone .",
    "this is also known as the elliott - yafet relation .",
    "however when the impurity scattering is close to the unitary limit , as often advocated for impurity doped high-@xmath3 superconductors , the elliott - yafet formula must be generalized in order to include multi - scattering processes .",
    "for a two - dimensional system with sufficiently diluted impurity concentrations @xmath11 , the solution of the normal state @xmath2-matrix equations for both @xmath4 and @xmath12 leads to:@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the density of states per spin direction at the fermi level . in the weak scattering limit @xmath18 , eq.([ey ] ) reproduces the result of the born approximation : @xmath19 .",
    "however for @xmath20 , that is the value estimated in ref .",
    ", eq.([ey ] ) leads to @xmath21 when @xmath22 , and in the extreme unitary limit : @xmath23 as long as @xmath24 .",
    "hence , when the impurity potential is strong , or more generally as long as @xmath25 , inevitably the spin - orbit interaction becomes as important as the spin - independent coupling to the impurity .",
    "the above discussion suggests therefore that if non - magnetic impurities in high-@xmath3 superconductors are close to the unitary limit , the effect of spin - orbit coupling should be large .",
    "in particular , the zeeman response to an applied magnetic field should be deeply altered by the spin - mixing processes associated with @xmath12 and eventually , for sufficiently strong spin - orbit scattering , the zeeman splitting should vanish . here",
    "it is shown that for two - dimensional systems this conclusion is actually wrong : the zeeman splitting resulting from the solution of the @xmath2-matrix equation is much more robust than that obtained within the born approximation , and at the unitary limit ( @xmath26 ) both @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave superconductors are fully zeeman - splitted by an applied in - plane magnetic field .",
    "for quasi - two dimensional systems the zeeman response to an external magnetic field @xmath27 should be best observed when @xmath27 is directed parallel to the conducting plane ( for example the cu - o plane in copper - oxides ) , since in this case the coupling of @xmath27 to the orbital motion of the electrons is minimized.@xcite hence , the total hamiltonian is @xmath28 where : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the electron dispersion measured with respect to the chemical potential , @xmath31 is a spin index , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the bohr magneton . in the following , it is assumed that the charge carriers are confined to move in the @xmath34-@xmath35 plane so that @xmath36 and that the spins are directed along and opposite to the direction of the magnetic field , fixed to lie along the @xmath34-direction : @xmath37 . for @xmath0-wave superconductors @xmath38 while for @xmath1-wave superconductors @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the polar angle in the @xmath41 plane . without loss of generality , here @xmath42",
    "is used as an input parameter although it should be calculated self - consistently from a suitable gap equation . moreover , for simplicity , local variations of the order parameter are neglected .",
    "the impurity and spin - orbit hamiltonians , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , are given by : @xmath45 @xmath46\\cdot \\hat{{\\bf z } } ) ( c^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf k}\\uparrow}c_{{\\bf k}'\\downarrow}+ c^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf k}\\downarrow}c_{{\\bf k}'\\uparrow}),\\ ] ] where @xmath47 denotes the random positions of the impurities and @xmath48 is the fermi momentum .",
    "note that because of two - dimensionality , the spin - orbit matrix element of eq.([hso ] ) is proportional to @xmath49 and , since the spins are quantized along the @xmath34 direction , the spin - orbit scattering is therefore always accompanied by spin - flip processes .",

    "this is done in the next subsections where eq.([tso3 ] ) is solved for both @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave symmetries .",
    "the usual procedure to evaluate self - consistently the electron propagator is to guess the form of @xmath52 which , after being substituted into @xmath78 and @xmath76 , generates only combinations of @xmath56 and @xmath79 matrices already contained in @xmath52 . the direct substitution of @xmath80 into @xmath78 and @xmath76 is a practical way to guess the correct form of @xmath52 via the dyson equation .",
    "when this is done , it is easy to realize that when the symmetry of the order parameter is @xmath0-wave , @xmath81 , the two matrices @xmath82 and @xmath83 defined in eqs.([axy],[ayx ] ) become equal .",
    "hence , the form of the electron propagator for an @xmath0-wave symmetry of the order parameter reduces to : @xmath84- \\rho_3[\\tilde{\\epsilon}({\\bf k})-i\\tilde{\\lambda}\\rho_3\\tau_3 ]   -\\rho_2\\tau_2[\\tilde{\\delta}-i\\tilde{\\gamma}\\rho_3\\tau_3],\\ ] ] where the frequency dependence of the tilded quantities is implicit .",
    "the tilded quantities are obtained by substituting eq.([g1 ] ) into the equations for the impurity and spin - orbit @xmath2-matrices and requiring self - consistency via the dyson equation . in general , the solution is very complicated but a considerable simplification arises if infinite electron band - width and particle - hole symmetry of the normal state electron dispersion are assumed . in this case in fact several integrals over @xmath85 average to zero,@xcite leading to the following self - consistent equations : @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , @xmath90 . to display the spin - mixing effect of the spin - orbit interaction , equations ( [ w1],[d1 ] )",
    "are more conveniently rewritten in terms of @xmath91 : @xmath92 apart for the trivial limit @xmath93 which holds true in the absence of spin - orbit interaction ( @xmath94 ) , the two spin channels @xmath95 and @xmath96 are coupled together . within the born approximation , @xmath97 , equation ( [ u1 ] ) reduces to the two - dimensional version of the @xmath98 formula found in classic literature:@xcite @xmath99 the novel feature displayed by the more general expression ( [ u1 ] ) is that , as the unitary limit @xmath100 is approached , @xmath95 and @xmath96 becomes decoupled and the full zeeman splitting @xmath101 is recovered . in such a limit",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-wave superconductor is fully zeeman - splitted as if the spin - orbit scattering would be spin conserving .",
    "the same conclusion can be obtained by calculating the zero temperature spin susceptibility @xmath102 as inferred by the linear response theory .",

    "the absence of spin - mixing contributions at the unitary limit can be interpreted as a consequence of the fact that @xmath113 commutes with @xmath114 while @xmath44 commutes with @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , for weak spin - orbit scattering ( @xmath97 ) @xmath114 is a rather good quantum number and @xmath44 induces weak spin - flip processes leading to coupled @xmath98 equations .",
    "the spin - decoupling at the unitary limit @xmath110 , could be explained by arguing that for very strong spin - orbit interaction @xmath115 rather than @xmath114 is a good quantum number .",
    "the cooper pairs are then formed by electrons with opposite spins in the @xmath116 direction and the spin rigidity of the superconducting condensate is efficient against spin - flip transitions induced by the magnetic field @xmath117 . in the limiting case of infinitely strong spin - orbit interaction , therefore @xmath118 can only induce polarization of the quasiparticle excitations . note that , in case the magnetic field is directed along the @xmath116 direction , the total hamiltonian then commutes with @xmath115 and",
    "the zeeman response of a @xmath0-wave superconductor becomes independent of the spin - orbit interaction for whatever value of @xmath119 .",
    "of course , for a three - dimensional system the above reasoning does no longer apply because the spin - orbit interaction does not commute with any component of @xmath120 .      for",
    "the above considerations to be valid it is required only two - dimensionality and a singlet superconducting condensate . therefore in principle also a two - dimensional @xmath1-wave superconductor should exhibit spin - channels decoupling as @xmath121 .",
    "this is indeed so even if there are qualitative differences with respect to @xmath0-wave superconductors since for @xmath1-wave symmetry the spin - orbit scattering becomes pair breaking .",

    "however now even at @xmath144 the spin susceptibility is expected to remain non - zero ( as long as @xmath145 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that , although there are not spin - mixing processes at @xmath26 , the pair - breaking effect of both impurity and spin - orbit scatterings leads to a finite density of states at the fermi level.@xcite in this situation therefore the zeeman splitted density of states is a more direct evidence for the spin decoupling effect at @xmath121 .",

    "1a and completely suppressed in fig .",
    "since at the unitary limit @xmath100 the spins are completely decoupled , eqs.([w3],[d3 ] ) , the two spin density of states are identical and shifted by @xmath157 one respect to the other .",
    "this is in contrast to the born solution , fig . 1b , for which the strong spin - mixing terms lead to a flat density of states",
    "it should be stressed that before reaching the @xmath158 limit , the born approximation predicts that @xmath1-wave superconductivity is already completely destroyed.@xcite therefore the results for @xmath159 in fig .",
    "1b should be considered just as a mathematical limit to be compared with the solutions of the @xmath2-matrix approach of fig .",
    "in summary , it has been shown that when non - magnetic impurity scattering is close to the unitary limit , the associated spin - orbit interaction is not small provided @xmath25 and must be treated beyond the simple born approximation . within the self - consistent @xmath2-matrix approach , it has been demonstrated that the zeeman splitting of both @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave two - dimensional superconductors is much more robust than that obtained by the born approximation . at the unitary limit @xmath26 ,",
    "for which the spin - orbit coupling is maximum , a two - dimensional @xmath0-wave superconductor does not show any spin - mixing processes and the zeeman response coincides with that of a pure superconductor .",

    "the calculation method here used is a standard one based on a @xmath2-matrix approximation for diluted impurities.@xcite however when applied to two - dimensional systems like the copper - oxides , the standard procedure is complicated by the appearance of singularities in the electron self - energy.@xcite contrary to the results based on the @xmath2-matrix solution and on self - consistent approaches to deal with the singularities,@xcite non - perturbative methods suggest that the density of states of a @xmath1-wave superconductor actually vanishes non analytically at the fermi level.@xcite the low energy behavior appears to be heavily modified by the level spacing of a localization volume which leads to the opening of a pseudogap in the low - lying single electron excitations.@xcite it should be however noted that discepancies between different approaches affect only the very low - energy excitations , while for energies not much smaller than @xmath42 the @xmath2-matrix approach is quite realiable ( for finite but small impurity concentrations ) . in this respect , the main result of fig .",
    "e. _ the persistence of the zeeman splitting of the coherence peaks in the density of states even when @xmath119 is zero ) should not be an artificial feature of the @xmath2-matrix approximation .",
    "this conclusion is also sustained by the quite general physical explanation of the zeeman - splitting persistence at the unitary limit proposed in sec.[swave ] and from an analysis of the singee spin - orbit impurity problem not reported here .",
    "note that , for these same reasons , some standard simplifications employed in the present calculations ( infinite band - width , particle - hole symmetric electron dispersion and absence of local suppressions of the order parameter ) should not affect too seriously the main result .                            for simplicity ,",
    "the present analysis is restricted only to @xmath0-wave impurity potentials of the form @xmath160 , where @xmath47 are the random positions of the impurities .",
    "@xmath4 is then given by @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the number of scatterers .",
    "the pair - breaking effect of the spin - orbit scattering in @xmath1-wave superconductors is obtained by solving self - consistently the gap equation .",
    "this is done in ref . within the self - consistent @xmath2-matrix approach without zeeman magnetic fields ( @xmath163 ) and in ref . within the born approximation for @xmath164 .      within the same approximation scheme employed for the @xmath0-wave case , the integration over the energy in eqs.([gd1],[fd1 ] )",
    "can be easily done analytically , but the final result is quite cumbersome and it is not reported here .",
