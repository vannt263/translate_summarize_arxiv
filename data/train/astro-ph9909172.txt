    "the crab nebula has been well studied with atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( act ) and has been established as a standard source in tev astronomy .",
    "the crab was the first predicted source of tev emission ( @xcite ) and also the first tev source to be detected at high significance with the advent of imaging acts ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed spectra so far reported ( @xcite ) seem to extend up to at least several 10 tev and to be nearly consistent with a synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) model based on the pulsar wind model of plerions ( @xcite ) . in this model , it is likely that electrons are accelerated up to ultra - high energies ( uhe ) extending to somewhat above @xmath3 ev in the pulsar wind shock ( @xcite ) , emitting soft photons by a synchrotron process .",
    "the emission of tev energies from the crab can then be explained as the inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of such relativistic electrons with soft photons , including infrared radiation from dust and the 2.7k microwave background .",
    "the ic @xmath0-ray spectrum depends on the parameter , @xmath1 , which is defined as the ratio of the magnetic field to the particle energy density in the wind , and thus on the magnetic field distribution in the nebula .",
    "measurements of the crab flux done so far in the tev range suggest that the wind is strongly particle dominated and @xmath1 takes a value larger than @xmath4 0.003 , but the flux becomes relatively insensitive to higher values of @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a more accurate determination of @xmath1 is provided by measurements above 10 tev , which begin to probe the inner parts of the nebula near the shock .",
    "the ic @xmath0-ray spectrum , however , will steepen at high energies , say higher than 10 tev since uhe electrons rapidly dissipate their energy by the synchrotron radiation .",
    "therefore , the contribution of @xmath5-decay @xmath0-rays becomes more important at high energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the protons are accelerated up to very high energies with a hard spectrum in the nebula , the @xmath5-decay contribution would become significant at multi - tev , or even dominating in the energy region higher than several 10 tev .",
    "therefore , an accurate measurement of the @xmath0-ray spectrum from the crab in the high energy region can set major constraints on the theoretical explanations and may provide vital information about the proton acceleration in snrs , which are the most promising candidate sources of cosmic rays in our galaxy .",
    "until now , using acts , several groups have succeeded in detecting the crab with very high significance in the tev energy region , but the systematic uncertainties in the flux estimates remain large .",
    "the spectrum , measured by several groups ( @xcite ) , differs in power - law slope as well as in absolute flux ; the derivation of an accurate @xmath0-ray flux from this source may prove more difficult , despite continual improvements in sensitivity of the detection technique .",
    "measurements using a different technique will be of great importance to understand the possible biases and errors involved in the cherenkov observations .    the tibet experiment ( @xcite ) , at an altitude of 4,300 m is the lowest energy air shower array and has sensitivity to @xmath0-ray air showers at energies as low as 3 tev ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , observations by the tibet experiment , using well established air shower technique , partially overlap those of cherenkov telescopes and will make a contribution to study the emission mechanism of high energy @xmath0-rays from the crab .",
    "we report on the first observation of multi - tev @xmath0-rays from the crab with the tibet air shower array .",
    "the tibet experiment , being successfully operated at yangbajing in tibet ( 4300 m above sea level ) , now consists of two overlapping arrays ( tibet - ii and hd ) as described elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "the tibet - ii array consists of 185 scintillation detectors of 0.5 m@xmath6 each placed on a 15 m square grid with an enclosed area of 36,900 m@xmath6 , and the hd ( high density ) array is operated inside the tibet - ii array to detect cosmic ray showers lower than 10 tev ( some of detectors are commonly used in both arrays ) .",
    "this hd array consists of 109 scintillation detectors , each viewed by a fast timing phototube , placed on a 7.5 m square grid , covering an area of 5,175 m@xmath6 ( @xcite ) . a lead plate of 5 mm thickness is placed on the top of each detector in both arrays to improve the fast timing data by converting @xmath0-rays in the showers into electron pairs .",
    "using lead converters typically increases the shower size by a factor of about 2 and improves the angular resolution by about 30 % .",
    "this also tends to flatten the conical shape of the shower front fairly ( @xcite ) .",
    "the recording system is triggered by any fourfold coincidence of the fast timing detectors , which results in a trigger rate of about 110 hz for the hd array .",
    "the hd array has been successfully operating since 1996 november .",
    "the observation presented here was made with this hd array .",
    "the data used in this search were collected between 1996 november and 1999 may .",
    "the event selection was done by imposing the following three conditions to the recorded data ; 1 ) each of any four detectors should record a signal of more than 1.25 particles , 2 ) among the four detectors recording the highest particles , two or more should be inside the innermost 9@xmath79 detectors ( 60  m @xmath7 60  m ) , 3 ) the zenith angle of the incident direction should be less than 45@xmath8 .",
    "after data processing and quality cuts , the total number of events selected was @xmath9 , and the effective running time was 502.1 days .",
    "the vast majority of events detected by the array are initiated by primary cosmic rays rather than @xmath0-rays , and therefore it is crucial to reject as much background as possible .",
    "the background cosmic rays are isotropic and @xmath0-rays from a source are apparently centered on the source direction , so that the reduction of hadronic showers must be accomplished via the good angular resolution of the array .    in order to achieve a good angular resolution , a study of core - finding techniques and shower - front curvature corrections has been made ( @xcite ) .",
    "the angular resolution of the tibet array can be well checked by observing the shadow that the moon casts in the cosmic ray flux ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , the high flux of cosmic ray events enables us to monitor the system operation by monthly observation of the moon s shadow . using the hd array ,",
    "the moon shadow was observed with a significance of 15@xmath1 at the maximum deficit position for all events . from this result ,",
    "the angular resolution of the hd array is estimated to be better than 0.9@xmath8 for all events .",
    "the resolution increases with increasing @xmath10 as @xmath11 , where @xmath10 stands for the sum of the number of shower particles per m@xmath6 detected in each detector .",
    "the primary cosmic rays are mostly composed of protons and nuclei with positive charge , so that those coming from the direction of the moon are bent by the geomagnetic field and the deflection angle , @xmath12 , of a cosmic ray impinging at normal angle on the earth is calculated as @xmath13 ) , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the energy of a primary particle in unit of tev and the atomic number , respectively .",
    "therefore , the moon shadow should be found in the direction somewhat away from the moon to the west . actually the center of the moon shadow observed in the events with @xmath16 = 15 - 50 was found at a position shifted to the west by about 0.3@xmath8 . on the other hand",
    ", we estimated the mean energy of primary protons generating such events at the yangbajing altitude to be about 4.7  tev according to the simulations ( the contribution of helium nuclei was estimated to be smaller than 20 % . ) .",
    "this value is compatible with that expected from the observed shift of the shadow and the geomagnetic field strength .",
    "a more elaborate study of the moon and sun shadows , using a monte carlo technique , also gives consistent results with the experiment ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the observation of the moon shadow can provide a direct check of the relation between shower size and primary energy when the primary energies are lower than 10 tev .",
    "very high energy cosmic rays ( @xmath17  tev ) , which have a negligible effect from the geomagnetic field , should cast a shadow in the same direction as the moon .",
    "also , it is known that the displacement of the shadow in the north - south direction is almost free from the effect of the geomagnetic field . on the basis of these facts ,",
    "the systematic pointing errors of the array can be estimated by examining small deviations of the moon shadow from the correct position .",
    "it is then found to be smaller than @xmath18 .    under the same observation conditions as the crab ,",
    "the trigger efficiencies of the array for 3 , 4 and 5  tev @xmath0-rays and protons are estimated to be 19  % and 10  % , 35  % and 18  % , and 47  % and 26  % , respectively .",
    "that is , the trigger efficiency of @xmath0-rays is about 2 times as large as that of protons when compared at the same energy .",
    "hence , observations made by the hd array will partially overlap those of cherenkov telescopes .",
    "we used a circular window to search for signals from the crab .",
    "the ratio of signal from a point source to the isotropic background of hadron primaries is increased by the good angular resolution of the array .",
    "the radius of the window is chosen to optimize the significance of signals defined as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of signals and @xmath21 the number of background events , and to contain about 50% of the signals from a source .",
    "as shown in the previous section , furthermore , the angular resolution of the array depends on the value of @xmath10 in an event . in this analysis ,",
    "the radii of search windows adopted for the events with @xmath22 15 ( all events ) , 40 , 70 and 130 were 0.8@xmath8 , 0.7@xmath8 , 0.5@xmath8 and 0.5@xmath8 respectively .",
    "the signals were searched for by counting the number of events coming from the on - source window .",
    "the background was obtained by averaging over events falling in the ten off - source windows adjacent to the source .",
    "the source window traverses a path in local coordinates ( @xmath23,@xmath24 ) through the day , where @xmath23 is the zenith angle and @xmath24 the azimuthal angle . in order to avoid the strong zenith angle dependence of the background , the off - source windows were taken in the @xmath24-directions with the same zenith angle @xmath23 , except two windows adjacent to the on - source window .",
    "we used the events with @xmath25 in the following analysis .",
    "we present the cumulative excess counts of the events with @xmath22 15 coming from the crab direction as a function of observation time in terms of sidereal day in fig .",
    "it is observed that the excess counts increase linearly with increasing observation time , confirming a steady output of multi - tev @xmath0-rays from the crab .",
    "figure 2 shows the opening angle distributions for the events with @xmath22 15 and 40 , respectively . here",
    ", the opening angle is defined as a space angle between the source direction and the event direction .",
    "the peak appearing around the origin in the source direction can be attributed to @xmath0-rays from the crab nebula .",
    "the statistical significances of the excess events with @xmath22 15 , 40 , 70 and 130 are 5.5  @xmath1 , 3.9  @xmath1 , 3.3  @xmath1 and 3.1  @xmath1 , respectively .    in order to estimate the crab spectrum , we calculated the trigger efficiency and the collecting area as a function of energy and threshold energy of the array for primary @xmath0-rays according to the simulation .",
    "as discussed in section 3 , the observations of the moon shadow provide an important check of the results obtained by assigning energies to all the events .",
    "however , the considerable scatter in the energy of events with the same size will introduce bias into the spectrum because the same size event is enhanced by upward fluctuations of lower energy events and the steeply falling spectrum .",
    "this results in an overestimation of the flux values .",
    "this effect must be adequately allowed for in the calculation of the effective collecting area .",
    "the reliability of the monte carlo for studying the array performance is checked by examining whether or not the trigger rate of the events can be accounted for by the incoming primary cosmic rays . adopting the primary mass composition directly measured by the experiments in the energy region lower than 10@xmath26 ev ( @xcite ) and",
    "assuming the heavy enriched composition above this region ( @xcite ) , we calculated the trigger rate of background events by a monte carlo simulation , taking into account the detector response and observation conditions .    shown in fig .",
    "3 is the zenith angle distribution of the trigger rate of the events with @xmath27 .",
    "we collected the events coming within a band of 2@xmath8 width along the zenith angle , @xmath23 , ranging from 10@xmath8 ( meridian zenith angle of the crab at yangbajing ) to 45@xmath8 .",
    "the experimental data agree well with the calculated results , proving the reliability of our monte carlo .",
    "the simulation also teaches us that the proportion of proton - induced events among all events is about 60 % , increasing with increasing zenith angle when @xmath10 is larger than 50 .",
    "we estimated the @xmath0-ray spectrum as follows .",
    "the primary @xmath0-rays with energies between @xmath28 and @xmath29 were thrown from the direction of the crab , assuming a differential power - law spectrum of the form @xmath30 starting at @xmath28 = 0.5 tev , which is well below the lowest triggering energy .",
    "the values of @xmath31 and @xmath29 were examined between 2.4 and 3.0 and between 40 tev and 100 tev , respectively .",
    "primary @xmath0-rays , developing into electron - photon cascade showers ( air showers ) in the atmosphere , were detected with the array under the same condition as the experiment .",
    "simulated events were divided into respective size bins according to @xmath10 and compared with those of the experiment .",
    "the energy of @xmath0-rays is defined as the energy of the maximum flux of simulated events in each bin .",
    "these steps were repeated until the simulation can well reproduce the experimental data .",
    "we also examined that the absolute fluxes do not change with the cut - off energy very much except in the highest energy bin . the energy spectrum obtained from this procedure",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "we fitted the crab data in the energy range between 3 tev and 15 tev by a simple power law , which yields    @xmath32    where only the statistical errors are quoted .",
    "the last three points on the high energy side were excluded from this fit because of low significances ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "also , the exponent of the spectrum can not be determined accurately because of the small energy range fitted here .",
    "the systematics errors on the flux arise mainly from the event selection which depends upon the array performance and from the calculations of the collecting area and the air shower size distribution by the simulation .",
    "they are estimated to be 13 % and 8 % , respectively .",
    "the range of the spectrum including the statistical and systematic errors is bounded by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "we also searched for @xmath0-ray signals from the crab in the energy region above 10 tev with the tibet - ii array .",
    "although improving the angular resolution of this array is still under way , the excess counts are detected at the statistical significances of @xmath34 level , while marginal yet , at energies around 30 tev .",
    "upper limit fluxes at the 90  % confidence level are shown in fig .",
    "4 , together with other experiments ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . recent measurements with imaging cherenkov telescopes give flux values lower than ours at multi - tev energies .",
    "the cangaroo data ( @xcite ) may not be incompatible with ours , but our data , if anything , may be in favor of a gradual steepening of the slope at high energies .",
    "tev fluxes have sensitivity to probe the spatial variation of magnetic field strength in the nebula , suggesting where the parent electrons exist in the nebula ( @xcite ) . viewed from this perspective",
    ", our data may make a caveat about the estimation of magnetic field strength ( @xcite ) .",
    "this will be confirmed by further observations of the spectrum up to high energies with the tibet array in the very near future .",
    "with the high density ( hd ) air shower array , operating at yangbajing since 1996 , we have observed multi - tev @xmath0-rays from the crab nebula and obtained the energy spectrum of @xmath0-rays in the energy region above 3 tev . this is the first clear observation of @xmath0-ray signals from point sources using a conventional air shower array .",
    "the success of the air shower array in detecting a signal at the 5 - 6  @xmath1 level was achieved by the improvement of the array performance which can be directly checked by observing the moon shadow .",
    "we have shown that the hd array has sensitivity to detect cosmic ray showers at energies as low as @xmath43  tev , as well as to observe the moon shadow with good statistics .",
    "a monthly observation of the moon shadow has made it possible to monitor the angular resolution , pointing accuracy and also the stable operation of the array over a long period .",
    "our observations complement telescopes using the atmospheric cherenkov technique in the energy region between 3 tev and several 10 tev , so that the present result may help to reduce the systematic uncertainties in the flux estimates using imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes , and eventually the mechanism of tev @xmath0-ray emission from the crab will be further refined .    the area of the present hd array will be extended by a factor of about five in 1999 , while its effective area will be increased by a factor of about seven by the reduction of edge effects .",
    "then , the tibet experiment would cover the wide energy range from 3  tev to @xmath4100  tev , and result in significantly better statistics and angular resolution at high energies .",
