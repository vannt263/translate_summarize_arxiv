    "the major goal of @xmath0 physics is to provide us with novel and decisive tests of the quark flavour sector .",
    "the most interesting @xmath0 decay channels typically have small branching fractions below @xmath1 and are being studied by the current generation of @xmath0 physics facilities .",
    "important examples of such decays are nonleptonic modes as @xmath2 or @xmath3 , and the radiative rare decays @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "they consitute a rich source of information , in particular on ckm angles and flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "many new results are becoming available from the @xmath0 factories .",
    "both inclusive and exclusive decays can be exploited .",
    "loosely speaking , the exclusive channels are easier for experiment while they are harder for theory .",
    "the challenge for theory is to control the effects of qcd . to achieve this",
    "it is necessary to devise a systematic factorization of short - distance and long - distance contributions , which usually results in a considerable simplification of the problem . for @xmath0 decay matrix elements this factorization relies on the hierarchy @xmath8",
    "this allows us to perform an expansion around the heavy - quark limit and to factorize perturbative contributions ( scales of order @xmath9 ) from nonperturbative dynamics ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "since the general concept of factorization in qcd has recently found new applications in the important domain of _ exclusive _ @xmath0 decays , we shall focus the following presentation on this area .",
    "the calculation of @xmath0-decay amplitudes , such as @xmath11 , @xmath2 or @xmath12 , starts from an effective hamiltonian , which has , schematically , the form @xmath13 here @xmath14 are the wilson coefficients at a scale @xmath15 , @xmath16 are local , dimension-6 operators and @xmath17 represents the appropriate ckm matrix elements .",
    "the main theoretical problem is to evaluate the matrix elements of the operators @xmath18 between the initial and final hadronic states .",
    "a typical matrix element reads @xmath19 .",
    "these matrix elements simplify in the heavy - quark limit , where they can in general be written as the sum of two terms , each of which is factorized into hard scattering functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , and the nonperturbative , but simpler , form factors @xmath22 and meson light - cone distribution amplitudes @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fform ] ) .",
    "important elements of this approach are : i ) the expansion in @xmath24 , consistent power counting , and the identification of the leading power contribution , for which the factorized picture can be expected to hold .",
    "ii ) light - cone dynamics , which determines for instance the properties of the fast light mesons .",
    "the latter are described by light - cone distribution amplitudes @xmath25 of their valence quarks defined as @xmath26 with @xmath27 on the light cone , @xmath28 .",
    "iii ) the collinear quark - antiquark pair dominating the interactions of the highly energetic pion decouples from soft gluons ( colour transparency ) . this is the intuitive reason behind factorization .",
    "iv ) the factorized amplitude consists of hard , short- distance components , and soft , as well as collinear , long - distance contributions .",
    "more details on the factorization formalism can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we would like to emphasize an important phenomenological application .",
    "consider the time - dependent , mixing - induced cp asymmetry in @xmath29 @xmath30 using ckm - matrix unitarity , the decay amplitude consists of two components with different ckm factors and different hadronic parts , schematically @xmath31 if the penguin contribution @xmath32 could be neglected , one would have @xmath33 and @xmath34 , hence a direct relation of @xmath35 to the ckm angle @xmath36 . in reality",
    "the penguin contribution is not negligible compared to the dominant tree contribution @xmath37 .",
    "the ratio of penguin and tree amplitude , which enters the cp asymmetry , depends on hadronic physics .",
    "this complicates the relation of observables @xmath38 and @xmath39 to ckm parameters .",
    "qcd factorization of @xmath0-decay matrix elements allows us to compute the required hadronic input and to determine the constraint in the ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) plane implied by measurements of the cp asymmetry .",
    "this is illustrated for @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spipi ] .",
    "the widths of the bands indicate the theoretical uncertainty @xcite .",
    "note that the constraints from @xmath38 are relatively insensitive to theoretical or experimental uncertainties .",
    "the analysis of direct cp violation measured by @xmath39 is more complicated due to the importance of strong phases .",
    "the current experimental results are @xmath42    qcd factorization to leading power in @xmath43 has been demonstrated at @xmath44 for the important class of decays @xmath2 , @xmath45 . for @xmath11 ( class i ) , where hard spectator interactions are absent , a proof has been given explicitly at two loops @xcite and to all orders in the framework of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",
    "complete matrix elements are available at @xmath44 ( nlo ) for @xmath2 , @xmath45 , including electroweak penguins .",
    "power corrections are presently not calculable in general .",
    "their impact has to be estimated and included into the error analysis .",
    "critical issues here are annihilation contributions and certain corrections proportional to @xmath46 , which is numerically sizable , even if it is power suppressed .",
    "however , the large variety of channels available will provide us with important cross checks and arguments based on su(2 ) or su(3 ) flavour symmetries can also be of use in further controling uncertainties .",
    "factorization in the sense of qcd can also be applied to the exclusive radiative decays @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) . the factorization formula for the operators in the effective weak hamiltonian",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath50 \\cdot\\epsilon\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the photon polarization 4-vector . here",
    "@xmath52 is a @xmath53 transition form factor , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 are leading twist light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcda ) of the @xmath0 meson and the vector meson @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "these quantities describe the long - distance dynamics of the matrix elements , which is factorized from the perturbative , short - distance interactions expressed in the hard - scattering kernels @xmath57 and @xmath58 . the qcd factorization formula ( [ fform ] )",
    "holds up to corrections of relative order @xmath59 .",
    "annihilation topologies are power - suppressed , but still calculable in some cases .",
    "the framework of qcd factorization is necessary to compute exclusive @xmath47 decays systematically beyond the leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "results to next - to - leading order in qcd , based on the heavy quark limit @xmath8 have been computed @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the method defines a systematic , model - independent framework for @xmath47 .",
    "an important conceptual aspect of this analysis is the interpretation of loop contributions with charm and up quarks , which come from leading operators in the effective weak hamiltonian .",
    "these effects are calculable in terms of perturbative hard - scattering functions and universal meson light - cone distribution amplitudes .",
    "they are @xmath44 corrections , but are leading power contributions in the framework of qcd factorization .",
    "this picture is in contrast to the common notion that considers charm and up - quark loop effects as generic , uncalculable long - distance contributions .",
    "non - factorizable long - distance corrections may still exist , but they are power - suppressed .",
    "the improved theoretical understanding of @xmath47 decays strengthens the motivation for still more detailed experimental investigations , which will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the flavour sector .    the uncertainty of the branching fractions is currently dominated by the form factors @xmath60 , @xmath61 . a nlo analysis @xcite yields ( in comparison with the experimental results in brackets ) @xmath62 ( @xmath63 @xcite ) and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 @xcite ) .",
    "taking the sizable uncertainties into account , the results for @xmath4 are compatible with the experimental measurements , even though the central theoretical values appear to be somewhat high .",
    "@xmath66 is a sensitive measure of ckm quantities such as the angle @xmath67 .",
    "substantial progress has taken place over the last few years in understanding the qcd dynamics of exclusive @xmath0 decays .",
    "the example of the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath68 nicely illustrates some aspects of these developments .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath69 is the rate difference between forward ( @xmath70 ) and backward ( @xmath71 ) going @xmath72 , normalized by the sum , where @xmath73 is the angle between the @xmath72 and @xmath0 momenta in the centre - of - mass frame of the dilepton pair .",
    "@xmath69 is usually considered as a function of the dilepton mass @xmath74 . in the standard model the spectrum @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : afb ] )    has a characteristic zero at @xmath76 depending on short - distance physics contained in the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the factor @xmath79 , on the other hand , is a hadronic quantity containing ratios of form factors .",
    "it was first stressed in @xcite that @xmath79 is not very much affected by hadronic uncertainties and very similar in different models for form factors with @xmath80 .",
    "after relations were found between different heavy - light form factors ( @xmath81 , @xmath56 ) in the heavy - quark limit and at large recoil @xcite , it was pointed out in @xcite that as a consequence @xmath82 holds exactly in this limit .",
    "subsequently , the results of @xcite were demonstrated to be valid beyond tree level @xcite . the use of the @xmath69-zero as a _",
    "clean _ test of standard model flavour physics was thus put on a firm basis and nlo corrections to ( [ afb0 ] ) could be computed @xcite .",
    "more recently also the problem of power corrections to heavy - light form factors at large recoil in the heavy - quark limit has been studied @xcite . besides the value of @xmath83 , also the sign of the slope of @xmath84 can be used as a probe of new physics . for a @xmath85 meson , this slope",
    "is predicted to be positive in the standard model @xcite .",
    "the tree - level process @xmath86 is not so much of direct interest for flavour physics , but it provides us with an important laboratory for studying qcd dynamics in exclusive @xmath0 decays , which is crucial for many other applications .",
    "the leading - power contribution comes from the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : blnug ] ( b ) ,    which contains a light - quark propagator that is off - shell by an amount @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the hard , light - like momentum of the photon with components scaling as @xmath9 ( this restricts the region of phase - space where the present discussion applies ) , and @xmath89 is the soft momentum of the spectator quark .",
    "the decay is thus determined by a hard - scattering process , but also depends on the structure of the @xmath0 meson in a non - trivial way @xcite .",
    "recently , in @xcite it has been proposed , and shown to one loop in qcd , that the form factors @xmath90 for this decay factorize as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the hard - scattering kernel and @xmath54 the light - cone distribution amplitude of the @xmath0 meson defined as @xmath93 the hard process is characterized by a scale @xmath94 . at lowest order",
    "the form factors are proportional to @xmath95 , a parameter that enters hard - spectator processes in many other applications .",
    "the analysis at nlo requires resummation of large logarithms @xmath96 .",
    "an extension of the proof of factorization to all orders was subsequently given by @xcite within the scet .",
    "factorization formulas in the heavy - quark limit have been proposed for a large variety of exclusive @xmath0 decays .",
    "they justify in many cases the phenomenological factorization ansatz that has been employed in many applications .",
    "in addition they enable consistent and systematic calculations of corrections in powers of @xmath97 . non - factorizable long - distance effects are not calculable in general but they are suppressed by powers of @xmath59 .",
    "so far , @xmath98 decays are probably understood best .",
    "decays with only light hadrons in the final state such as @xmath2 , @xmath99 , @xmath5 , or @xmath100 include hard spectator interactions at leading power and are therefore more complicated .",
    "an important new tool that has been developed is the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) , which is of use for proofs of factorization and for the theory of heavy - to - light form factors at large recoil .",
    "recent studies of the prototype process @xmath86 have also led to a better understanding of qcd dynamics in exclusive hadronic @xmath0 decays .",
    "all these are promising steps towards achieving a good theoretical control over qcd dynamics in rare hadronic @xmath0 decays , which is necessary for probing cp violation , flavour physics and new phenomena at short distances .",
