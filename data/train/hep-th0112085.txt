    "+ global defects are topologically stable scalar field configurations with nontrivial homotopy for some internal symmetry manifolds @xcite .",
    "usually , this kind of topological defect arises in a theory with @xmath0 scalar fields and a potential which has a vacuum manifold with the topology of a @xmath1-sphere .",
    "the simplest examples are domain walls @xcite when the vacuum manifold has a discrete symmetry , global strings @xcite when @xmath2 , and global monopoles @xcite when @xmath3 , in four spacetime dimensions . while the global monopole has a well - defined static metric , the domain wall and the global string do not .",
    "the domain wall spacetime is non - static and the metric in the plane of the domain wall is that of a @xmath4-dimensional de sitter space .",
    "the spacetime of the global string has a curvature singularity at a finite distance from the string core @xcite .",
    "its metric was found by cohen and kaplan @xcite .",
    "however , gregory showed that time dependence could remove the singular nature of the global string spacetime @xcite .",
    "while these analyses were purely within the context of einstein gravity in four dimensions ( in the absence of a cosmological constant ) , the global string spacetime is always regular in the presence of a negative cosmological constant @xcite , no matter how small cosmological constant may be . because the negative cosmological constant could do a role to avoid the singularity rounding off the spacetime before it terminates at the singularity .",
    "global defects were first considered in four spacetime dimensions , but recently they have been studied in higher dimensions in the context of the brane world scenarios , such as the large extra dimension scenario ( add ) @xcite and the randall - sundrum ( rs ) scenario @xcite . according to the brane world picture the three space dimensional world that we appear to be living in is a brane that is embedded in a higher - dimensional world .",
    "the brane world scenarios are really attractive in that the newtonian gravity is recovered on the brane despite the gravity is fundamentally higher - dimensional one , even with large ( infinite ) extra dimensions .",
    "this approach provides a plausible explanation of the hierarchy between the gravitational and the electroweak mass scales , opening the possibility for construction of new classes of models for the unified theory .",
    "these theories also open new approaches to the cosmological constant problem , because if our four - dimensional world is embedded in a higher - dimensional spacetime , the effect of non - zero vacuum energy could affect only the curvature in the extra dimensions allowing for a flat four - dimensional world as first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there have been various attempts to realize the brane world scenario in the context of higher - dimensional gravitating global defects in refs .",
    "@xcite . cohen and kaplan @xcite have considered a brane world , which may be viewed as a global string in two extra dimensions .",
    "its spacetime exhibits a curvature singularity at a finite distance from the string core , similar to the case in four dimensions .",
    "they argued that , imposing a unitary boundary condition , the location of the singularity may play a role of the boundary of the extra dimensions , which form a finite but non - compact space of exponentially large proper size .",
    "the phenomenology resembles the add scenario , rather than that of the rs scenario .",
    "gregory @xcite has shown that a non - singular global string - like solution with the required properties for the rs - type scenario exists in the presence of a negative bulk cosmological constant .",
    "olasagasti and vilenkin @xcite explored a more general case of a brane carrying a global charge in a higher - dimensional spacetime with a nonzero cosmological constant .",
    "in particular , with a negative cosmological constant there exist solutions of which the geometry of extra dimensions asymptotes to a cylinder with cross section being a @xmath1-sphere of a fixed radius ( cigar - like geometry ) . the cigar - like solutions with an exponentially decaying warp factor is of interest , since they have features needed for the rs - type scenario .    on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors investigated the spacetime of higher - dimensional global defects in the presence of a negative cosmological constant adopting schwarzschild - type metric anstz .",
    "they found extremal black hole - like @xmath5 space dimensional defects ( global black @xmath5-branes ) , which are ricci - flat branes surrounded by a degenerated horizon .",
    "they showed that the near horizon geometry of the extremal global black branes coincides with the cigar - like geometry with an exponentially damping warp factor discovered in refs .",
    "the interior region inside the horizon of the global black @xmath5-brane possesses all of features needed for a brane world with the newtonian gravity . in the picture of ref",
    "@xcite the size of the horizon can be interpreted as the compactification size of @xmath0 extra dimensions , even though the interior region inside the horizon infinitely extends and asymptotes to @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the large mass hierarchy is translated into the large size of the horizon , which could be supported by the large magnitude of charge carried by the black branes . in this picture",
    ", the hawking radiation could be a possible mechanism for the resolution of various problems associated with brane world scenarios , such as the observed flatness and the approximate lorentz invariance of our world .",
    "the bending of the brane and the bulk curvature that violate the @xmath7 isometry on our brane @xcite would correspond to excitations upon the extremal state , and the excited states that are non - extremal black branes would evolve into an extremal state through the hawking radiation process .    the nonzero vacuum energy density ( equivalently , the cosmological constant ) on the brane could also be an excitation upon the extremal state , which would be diluted via the hawking process if the excited state correspond to a non - extremal black brane .",
    "however , even though the state excited by the vacuum energy density is a non - extremal state , it will be somehow different from static non - extremal black branes treated usually in the literatures before in the context of supergravity or string theories @xcite , because with nonzero vacuum energy density the branes will inflate and the corresponding spacetime will not be static .",
    "therefore , their thermodynamic properties will also be different from those of the static ones . in this respect",
    ", we may need to find the corresponding black brane solutions and to examine their thermodynamic properties , to see whether a certain thermodynamic process can be a dynamical mechanism thinning out the vacuum energy density on the brane .",
    "this paper will be mainly devoted to finding global black brane solutions which are extended global defects surrounded by horizons and studying their spacetime structures .",
    "however , we will also focus on a few aspect of a brane world based on the global black branes and the cosmological constant problem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the equations of motion corresponding to the schwarzschild - type metric anstz in a scalar theory with global internal symmetry coupled to higher - dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant . in sec .",
    "iii , we explore black hole - like @xmath5 space dimensional defect ( black @xmath5-brane ) solutions , which shall be referred in what follows as global black @xmath5-brane `` or global black brane '' .",
    "we find series solutions in a few separated regions and confirm numerically that they can be mutually connected . when the world volume of the branes is ricci - flat , the branes are surrounded by a degenerated horizon , while when the world volume is not ricci - flat but of a positive constant curvature , they are surrounded by two horizons .",
    "they correspond to extremal black branes and non - extremal ones , respectively . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the spacetime structures of the global black branes .",
    "their causal structures resemble those of the reissner - nordstrm black holes in anti - de sitter spacetime , if we consider the transverse slice to the brane .",
    "the near horizon geometries are an infinitely long anti - de sitter throat with the topology of @xmath6 for the extremal black branes , and the spacetime of an inflating @xmath5 space dimensional domain wall times @xmath1-dimensional sphere for non - extremal ones . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss a few issues associated to the brane world scenarios .",
    "we briefly comment a few thermodynamic properties of the global black branes , and discuss a decrease of the cosmological constant on the brane world through the thermodynamic instability of the non - extremal global black brane .",
    "in the last section , we end with some conclusions .",
    "+ in this section we derive field equations appropriate to isolated gravitating global defects in higher - dimensional spacetime with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "higher - dimensional gravitating global defects are described as topologically stable scalar field configurations of a field theory with a spontaneously broken continuous global symmetry coupled to @xmath8-dimensional gravity .",
    "we consider a scalar theory with global @xmath9 symmetry coupled to gravity , of which potential has minimum on the @xmath1-sphere of radius @xmath10 : @xmath11 \\label{action},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the fundamental scale of the higher - dimensional gravity theory .",
    "we use a mostly plus signature . note that @xmath13 and @xmath14 have a mass dimension of @xmath15 and the negative bulk cosmological constant ( @xmath16 ) has a mass dimension of 2 .",

    "we shall use the notation @xmath21 with @xmath22 for the coordinates on the @xmath5-brane world volume . @xmath23",
    "denote the transverse coordinates to the @xmath5-brane and are related to the spherical coordinates of the transverse space by the usual relations : @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the corresponding einstein equations and scalar field equation are @xmath26 where @xmath27",
    "the global defects are defined by a topologically nontrivial mapping of the vacuum manifold @xmath28 to the boundary of transverse dimensions @xmath29 .",
    "we take anstz for the scalar field configuration as : @xmath30 where the function @xmath31 could be a function of both @xmath32 and @xmath33 in general .",
    "the defect solution should have @xmath34 at the center of the defect and approach the radial ` hedgehog ' configuration outside the core .    in this paper , we consider a particular case that the energy - momentum tensor of the defects is time independent . as a result ,",
    "no gravitational and particle radiation exists .",
    "the spacetime section transverse to the defects is static , and the whole spacetime including longitudinal directions is allowed to be static or stationary as we will see later .",
    "the spacetime of the extended global defects have the topology of @xmath35 . for black branes , the spacetime transverse to the brane will be a generalization of the @xmath36-dimensional spherically symmetric solutions , _",
    "e.g. _ the schwarzschild or the reissner - nordstrm black hole solutions . to obtain these solutions of the einstein equations",
    "we will assume that outside any horizon there is a killing vector which is timelike and that surfaces of constant @xmath32 are formed from concentric @xmath1-spheres times @xmath5-dimensional space .",
    "we can then quite generally adopt following schwarzschild - type metric anstz : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a metric on @xmath39-dimensional brane world volume which is not necessarily static , @xmath40 is the line element on the unit @xmath1-sphere , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are functions of @xmath33 only . with this metric anstz ,",
    "the defect solutions with unit winding number correspond to the field configurations @xmath43 the defect solutions have @xmath44 at the center and approach @xmath45 outside core .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor for the field configuration ( [ bbhh ] ) is then given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "since the metric ( [ bbm ] ) is a special case of the more general class of metric , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the metric of the slice in the transverse directions and @xmath50 is the world volume metric , the ricci tensor splits in the following way : @xmath51   \\label{rtm}\\\\ r_{ab}&=&\\tilde{r}_{ab}-(p+1)\\frac{\\tilde{\\nabla}_a\\tilde{\\nabla}_b f}{f}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath52 , through einstein s equations we have that @xmath53 and finally , from eq .",

    "therefore , without losing generality we can assume that the spatial part of the metric intrinsic to the brane is homogeneous and isotropic , and the directions parallel to the brane are boost invariant in the strong sense .",
    "einstein s field equations then reduce to @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 supplemented by the equation for the metric on the @xmath5-brane , @xmath60 it can be easily shown that only two of the three equations ( [ ein1])-([ein3 ] ) are independent .",

    "+ we may be able to find several classes of solutions to the set of field equations ( [ ein1])-([sfe ] ) . however , we will restrict our discussion to only black hole - like solutions in this paper .",
    "first , we find extremal black brane solutions which are flat branes surrounded by a degenerated horizon .",

    "for the global @xmath65 theory , there are three types of solutions depending on the relative scales of parameters of the theory : the cosmological constant , the planck scale and the symmetry breaking scale .",

    "there exist non - topological solitons of half integral winding in the given model , and the corresponding spacetimes involve charged btz black holes .    when @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the equations of motion , however , become much more nonlinear as can be seen from eqs . ( [ ein1])-([sfe ] ) .",

    "this seems to be well matched with the zeroth law of black hole mechanics . here , an interesting point is that the surface gravity at the horizons is determined by the brane world volume curvature solely regardless the size of the horizon unlike usual black hole and static black brane cases .",

    "if the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum energy on the brane is coupled to bulk fields ( including bulk gravitational field ) , then the vacuum energy density could be radiated into the bulk outside of the outer horizon through the hawking radiation process , resulting in a decrease of the vacuum energy density or , equivalently , the world volume curvature @xmath55 .",

    "<S> this paper is mainly devoted to studying global black brane solutions which are extended global defects surrounded by horizons . </S>",
    "<S> we find series solutions in a few separated regions and confirm numerically that they can be mutually connected . when the world volume of the brane is ricci - flat , the brane is surrounded by a degenerated horizon , while it is surrounded by two horizons when the world volume has a positive constant curvature . </S>",
    "<S> each solution corresponds to an extremal and a non - extremal state , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> their causal structures resemble those of the reissner - nordstrm black holes in anti - de sitter spacetime . however , the non - extremal black brane is not a static object , but an inflating brane . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we briefly discuss a brane world model in the context of the global black branes . </S>",
    "<S> we comment on a few thermodynamic properties of the global black branes , and discuss a decrease of the cosmological constant on the brane world through the thermodynamic instability of the non - extremal global black brane . </S>"
