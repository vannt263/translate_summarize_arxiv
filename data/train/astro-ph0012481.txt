    "there is evidence from their x - ray spectra that a variety of different emission mechanisms contribute to the x - ray luminosity of early - type galaxies .",

    "x - ray bright e and s0 galaxies ( those with high @xmath3 ) emit thermally with a spectrum that is well modeled by an optically thin plasma with a temperature of @xmath4 kev ( forman , jones , & tucker 1985 ; canizares , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1987 ) .",
    "x - ray faint e and s0 s ( those with low @xmath3 ) have spectra that require a model comprised of two components , soft emission with @xmath5 ( fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1994 ) and a hard component ( matsumoto et al .",
    "the hard component has been fit either as thermal bremsstrahlung with @xmath6 kev ( matsumoto et al .",
    "1997 ) or a power - law ( allen , di matteo , & fabian 2000 ) . the hard component of the spectra for x - ray faint e and s0 galaxies is roughly proportional to the optical luminosity of the galaxy , suggesting that its origin is low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) such as those seen in our galaxy ( trinchieri & fabbiano 1985 ) . in some galaxies , a central active galactic nucleus ( agn )",
    "may be an important source of hard x - ray emission ( allen et al .",

    "1996 ; irwin & sarazin 1998a , b ) .",
    "it might be due to interstellar gas , lmxbs , some other stellar component , or some other source .",
    "irwin & sarazin ( 1998a , b ) argued that lmxbs produce much of the soft emission in the most x - ray faint galaxies , while the contribution of interstellar gas increases as @xmath3 increases . in x - ray",
    "faint e and s0 galaxies , much of this hot gas may have been lost in galactic winds or as a result of ram pressure stripping by intragroup or intracluster gas .    until now , x - ray detectors have not had sufficient spatial resolution to resolve the lmxbs from diffuse emission in most external galaxies .",
    "chandra _ x - ray observatory has given us the opportunity to resolve these components spatially and spectrally and to uncover the source of emission from x - ray faint e and s0 galaxies .",

    "observation of the s0 galaxy ngc  1553 .",
    "its @xmath3 ratio puts it on the bright end of the class of x - ray faint ellipticals and s0 s ( irwin & sarazin 1998b ) .",
    "although other galaxies have lower @xmath3 ratios , ngc  1553 was chosen because its high x - ray flux and proximity make it a good candidate for resolving lmxbs with @xmath0 .",
    "another x - ray faint galaxy , ngc  4697 , with a lower @xmath3 ratio was also observed ( sarazin , irwin , & bregman 2000 ) .",
    "ngc  4697 is closer with a lower x - ray flux and will sample the faint end of the lmxb luminosity function .",
    "the @xmath3 ratio and x - ray colors of ngc  1553 put it in a class of galaxies that irwin & sarazin ( 1998b ) hypothesized may have some contribution of hot ism to the spectrum , that could be fit by a thermal model with @xmath7 and metallicity of 10 - 20% of solar along with a stellar component .",
    "ngc  1553 is interacting with a companion , ngc  1549 , as evidenced by shells of emission seen in the optical .",
    "the two galaxies are separated by 11@xmath88 ( bridges & hanes 1990 ) .",
    "ngc  1553 is known to have cool gas and dust associated with it .",
    "it was detected in the infrared in all four @xmath9 bands studied in bally & thronson ( 1989 ) .",
    "in addition , it is a weak radio source with a flux density of 10 mjy at 843 mhz ( harnett 1987 ) .",
    "a dust lane was observed at small scales ( @xmath10 across ) at the center of the galaxy with hst ( quillen , bower , & stritzinger 2000 ) .",
    "previous x - ray observations with the @xmath11 hri ( trinchieri , noris , & di serego alighieri , 1997 ) revealed substructure in the x - ray map , but the resolution was not high enough to distinguish individual lmxbs .",
    "the distance to ngc  1553 is somewhat poorly known , and reported values vary widely . however , ngc  1553 is known to be interacting with ( and therefore at the same distance as ) the elliptical galaxy ngc  1549 .",
    "consistent measurements for the distance to ngc  1549 of 24.2 mpc are given by faber et al .",
    "( 1989 ; assuming @xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 ) and tonry ( 2000 ) using the @xmath14 and surface brightness fluctuations methods , respectively .",
    "we thus adopt 24.2 mpc as the distance to ngc  1553 .",
    "ngc  1553 was observed with _",
    "chandra _ on 2000 january 2 - 3 for a total of 33,882 s. the center of the galaxy was positioned on the acis - s3 ccd , with an offset of one arcmin from the nominal pointing for the s3 .",
    "the s3 was selected for its sensitivity at low energies .",
    "in addition to the s3 , data were received from the acis i2 , i3 , s2 , and s4 ccds . in the analysis that follows , we use data from the s3 chip only .",
    "the events were telemetered in very faint mode , the data were collected with frame times of 3.2 seconds , and the ccd temperature was -110 c. only events with @xmath15 grades of 0,2,3,4 , and 6 were included .",
    "bad pixels , bad columns , and columns to either side of bad columns and node boundaries were excluded .",
    "event pi values and photon energies were determined using the acisd1999-09-16gainn0004.fits gain file .",
    "_ chandra _ is known to experience periods of high background ( `` background flares '' ) , which are particularly significant for the s3 chip ( markevitch 2000 ; markevitch et al .  2000 ) .",
    "we searched our data for such flares and found that , unfortunately , much of the exposure was affected by them .",
    "a light curve for the entire s3 chip for events with energies in the range 0.3 - 10.0 kev is displayed in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] .",
    "there are 1000 time bins of 34.17 s. the average quiescent source plus background rate is about 1.19 ct s@xmath13 , of which 0.85 ct s@xmath13 are background ( markevitch 2000 ) and 0.34 ct s@xmath13 are due to ngc  1553 .",
    "the background flares are most prevalent during the first half of the exposure , where the background rate reached upwards of 60 ct s@xmath13 .",
    "ideally , one would like to remove all of the exposure where the background is increased significantly above the quiescent background ( markevitch 2000 ) . unfortunately , this would remove most of the exposure . in order to retain as much of the exposure as possible ,",
    "while also keeping the signal - to - noise ratio as high as possible , we excluded data from our analysis that had a total s3 count rate greater than 5 ct s@xmath13 . with this cutoff value",
    ", we eliminated 81% of the background and only 31% of the exposure .",
    "the resulting total exposure , corrected for background flares , is 23,192 s. we also searched for periods of incorrect aspect solution , and none were found .    in our analysis of the diffuse emission in ngc  1553 , we determine the background from a circular region as far away as possible from the galaxy on the s3 ccd .",
    "unfortunately , the elevated background in our observations , even after removing the strongest background flares , meant that we can not use the available blank sky background fields , which were all taken during times of quiescent background only ( markevitch 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , the other backside illuminated ccd ( the s1 ) was turned off during this observation due to the fep0 problem , so we could not take background from the s1 .",
    "it is possible that even the outermost regions of the s3 chip may still contain some emission from ngc  1553 , so our analysis may underestimate the total amount of diffuse emission . however ,",
    "examination of the @xmath11 pspc image of ngc  1553 reveals that there does not appear to be galaxy emission in our background region .",
    "the analysis of resolved sources was not affected by this , as the background was determined locally so that both true background and superposed diffuse emission could be subtracted .",
    "this observation was processed at a time when the standard pipeline processing introduced a boresight error of about 8  in the absolute positions of x - ray sources .",
    "we made an approximate correction for this error .",
    "the resulting position for the bright x - ray source near the center of ngc  1553 agreed with the _ hubble _ space telescope ( hst ) position ( data kindly provided by a. kundu ) of the center of the galaxy to 19 .",
    "there are a number of arguments which indicate that the central x - ray source is associated with the active nucleus of the galaxy (   [ sec : agn ] ) .",
    "thus , we corrected the x - ray positions so that the central x - ray source coincided with the nucleus of ngc  1553 as determined with hst .",
    "we also found a very good agreement ( 050 ) between the positions of three x - ray sources and three globular clusters in ngc  1553 found with hst ( a. kundu , private communication ) . before correction",
    ", all three globulars were displaced from their x - ray source in the same direction as the optical and x - ray position of the central agn .",
    "the initial data reduction was done with the _ chandra _ analysis package ciao .",
    "some of the image analysis was done with iraf / pros .",
    "the spectra were extracted using software very kindly provided by alexey vikhlinin ( vikhlinin , markevitch , & murray 2000 ) .",
    "the spectra were analyzed using xspec .",
    "figure  [ fig : xwhole ] shows the _ chandra _ s3 image of ngc  1553 in the 0.3 - 10.0 kev energy band .",
    "the image has not been corrected for exposure or background .",
    "it has been smoothed slightly with a @xmath16 ( 1 pixel ) gaussian so that features may be seen more easily .",
    "discrete sources are evident and are concentrated at the center of the galaxy .",
    "the brightest source in the field is located at the center of ngc  1553 , and is probably due to the active nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , diffuse emission is apparent in figure  [ fig : xwhole ] . in general , the diffuse emission is elongated at a position angle of @xmath17 , which is similar to that of the optical light ( fig .",
    "[ fig : optical ] below ) .",
    "the diffuse component is seen more clearly in figure  [ fig : xsmooth ] which displays the adaptively smoothed @xmath18 central region of the galaxy .",
    "the smoothed image has a minimum signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of three per smoothing beam and was corrected for background and exposure .",

    "the diffuse x - ray emission is asymmetric with extensions to the nw and se .",
    "in addition there is a bright `` spiral '' feature in the diffuse emission that runs sw to ne through the center of the galaxy .",
    "this spiral is approximately perpendicular to the optical axis .",
    "discrete sources were found on the acis s3 image by running the ciao @xmath21 wavelet detection algorithm .",
    "the source detection threshold was set at @xmath22 , implying that @xmath23 false source ( due to a statistical fluctuation ) would be detected within the area of the s3 image .",
    "the detection limit for the sources corresponds approximately to a count rate of @xmath24 ct s@xmath13 .",
    "the sources were checked on the x - ray image , and the @xmath21 count rates were verified with aperture photometry in iraf / pros .",
    "the count rates from the two methods agreed well in all cases .",

    "the sources are listed in order of increasing distance from the center of ngc  1553 . based on background source number counts from the deep _ chandra _ observations of mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and brandt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we expect that 6 - 12 of the sources in ngc  1553 may be unrelated to the galaxy .",
    "we examined the positions of the resolved x - ray sources on the digital sky survey ( dss ) image of the field of ngc  1553 .",
    "figure  [ fig : optical ] shows an overlay of the x - ray source positions onto the dss image .",
    "we found six possible optical identifications from the dss , which are noted with `` dss '' in column 9 of table  [ tab : sources ] .",
    "the dss positions are consistently offset to the sw from the _ chandra _ positions , with an average offset of 2@xmath28 .",
    "these associations are mainly in the outer parts of the field , as it is difficult to detect faint optical sources in the inner regions of ngc  1553 using the dss .",
    "we also compared the positions of our x - ray sources with a catalog of globular cluster candidates in ngc  1553 based on hst observations ( a. kundu , private communication ) .",
    "the three _ chandra _ sources that have positions coincident ( to within 05 ) with those of globular clusters are srcs .  4 , 11 , and 23 ( cxou j041609.6 - 554642 , cxou j041611.0 - 554712 , and cxou j041621.5 - 554731 ) .",
    "these sources are indicated by `` hst '' in the notes column .",
    "based on the numbers of globular clusters and x - ray sources found within the region covered by the hst observation , we expect only 0.05 chance matches within 05 .",
    "we therefore conclude that all three of these associations are probably real .",
    "comparison with the 843 mhz radio map in harnett ( 1987 ) reveals extended radio emission with a flux density of 10 mjy coincident with the center of ngc  1553 .",
    "in addition , there is a bright nearby point source with a flux density of 166 mjy at a distance of approximately two arcminutes from the galaxy center .",
    "the position of this radio sources coincides ( within 1 arcsec ) of the @xmath0 detected src .",
    "27 , as well as an optical object on the dss .",
    "it is likely a background object .",
    "the second brightest resolved source detected on the s3 chip is src .",

    "this source was also seen in @xmath30 data by trinchieri et al .",

    "( 2000 ) also marginally detected a hard x - ray source ( @xmath3110100 kev ) with the pds in the field of ngc  1553 .",
    "the lack of spatial resolution of the pds means that a counterpart could be anywhere within approximately 75 arcmin , which is much larger than the field of view of our @xmath0 observation .",
    "none of the @xmath0 sources has a hard x - ray flux ( say , 510 kev ) which is within an order of magnitude of the pds source , so it is unlikely that this very hard x - ray emission is produced by any of the sources we detected .",
    "we first study the crude spectral properties of the resolved sources using hardness ratios , which have the advantage that they can be determined for fainter sources than detailed spectra .",
    "for consistency with the previous _ chandra _ study of ngc  4697 ( sarazin , irwin , & bregman 2000 ) , we use the three energy bands : soft s 0.31.0 kev , medium m 1.02.0 kev , and hard h 2.010.0 kev . as in sarazin , irwin , & bregman ( 2000 ) , we define two x - ray hardness ratios @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . for those resolved sources that have more than 20 counts ,",
    "the hardness ratios and their errors are shown in figure  [ fig : colors ] .",
    "for comparison , the hardnesses of the total emission ( diffuse plus sources ) are @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "isolating the diffuse emission gives hardness ratios of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , while the sum of the resolved sources yields @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "most of the resolved x - ray sources have colors which are similar to the sources detected with _",
    "chandra _ in the x - ray faint elliptical ngc  4697 ( sarazin , irwin , & bregman 2000 ) .",
    "unlike ngc  4697 , no supersoft sources were found .",
    "the central source ( src .  1 , cxou j041610.5 - 554646 ) , which is the brightest source in the field and whose position agrees with the nucleus of the galaxy , has hard x - ray colors , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this suggests that it is a strongly absorbed agn rather than an x - ray binary in the galaxy (   [ sec : agn ] ) .",
    "we searched for temporal variations in the x - ray emission from the individual resolved sources in the 0.310.0 kev energy band .",
    "we are limited in such searches by the relatively small number of photons detected from most of the sources .",
    "the timing resolution is also limited by the frame time of 3.2 s. thus , we only performed a relatively simple test ; we used the kolmogoroff - smirov ( ks ) statistic to test the null hypothesis that the source plus background rate is uniform over the active exposure time .",
    "we consider sources to be possibly variable only if a uniform emission rate can be ruled out at the 90% confidence level",
    ". using this technique , we find that five of the resolved sources may be variable",
    ". they are srcs .  4 , 17 , 36 , 40 , & 41 ( cxou j041609.6 - 554642 , cxou j041602.9 - 554655 , cxou j041617.9 - 554955 , cxou j041545.5 - 554543 , & cxou j041611.5 - 555029 ) , which have probabilities of 7.5% , 2.2% , 2.4% , 5.2% , and 4.6% , respectively , that they are not variable .",
    "the first of these sources is also coincident with a globular cluster candidate detected with hst .",
    "however , since we tested 49 sources , we expect 10% or @xmath315 to appear to be variable due to random fluctuations .",
    "the count rates for the sources were converted into x - ray luminosities @xmath27 in the 0.310.0 kev energy band assuming all of the sources are at the distance of ngc  1553 of 24.2 mpc . to determine the conversion from count rate to unabsorbed energy flux in the band 0.310 kev , we used the best fitting spectral model for the cumulative spectrum of all of the resolved sources ( excluding the central source and src .",
    "38 which is very bright and likely a background object ) .",
    "we fit the spectrum in the energy range 0.710.0 kev , where we are confident that the response is accurate , with a model including absorption fixed at the galactic value , a soft blackbody component and a hard power - law component (   [ sec : spec_sources ] ) .",
    "we then took the unabsorbed flux from 0.310.0 kev without refitting the spectrum for the expanded energy range . the resulting conversion between count rate and luminosity",

    "the luminosity values are given in column 8 of table  [ tab : sources ] .",
    "the source luminosities range between @xmath43 and @xmath44 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "a luminosity function was constructed for the sources and is plotted as a histogram in figure  [ fig : lumfunc ] . the central source ( src .",
    "1 ) was not included in this luminosity function .",
    "we fit the luminosity function of the resolved sources to either a power - law or broken power - law model for the galactic sources , plus the expected contribution of background and foreground sources , determined from the deep blank field _",
    "_ observations of brandt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and mushotzky et al .",
    "the background sources are assumed to follow the number versus flux relation derived from _",
    "deep fields ( hasinger et al .  1998 ) .",
    "a single power - law did not produce an acceptable fit to the observed luminosity function ; it could be rejected at the @xmath4594% confidence level .",
    "fitting a broken power - law , however , resulted in a good fit , which is shown as the continuous curve in figure  [ fig : lumfunc ] .",
    "the broken power - law luminosity function takes the form : @xmath46 where @xmath47 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 for @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the 0.310 kev x - ray luminosity in units of 10@xmath52 erg s@xmath13 . the best fit , determined by the maximum - likelihood method , with errors determined with monte carlo simulations , gave @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and a break luminosity of @xmath56 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "because of the limited range of luminosities observed below the break luminosity , the low luminosity slope @xmath57 is very poorly determined .    to examine how incompleteness might affect the luminosity function at the faint end , we simulated the observation using marx ( model of axaf response to x - rays ; wise et al .",

    "we assumed that the luminosity function of the sources was a single continuous power - law , which matched the best - fit ngc  1553 luminosity function above @xmath58 .",
    "this power - law was continued to a low luminosity at which the total lmxb luminosity matched the observed total ( resolved and unresolved ) lmxb emission in ngc  1553 .",
    "the diffuse emission and background were modeled based on a wavelet reconstruction of the unresolved emission in ngc  1553 , corrected for unresolved lmxbs .",
    "the sources in the simulated observation were detected using wavdetect using the same criteria as in the real data , and their count rates were converted into luminosities in the same way as the real sources .",
    "we found that the luminosity function of the simulated sources was depressed below the input model luminosity function below a luminosity of approximately @xmath59 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "while this is below the break luminosity determined from the data in ngc  1553 , it shows that incompleteness strongly affects the slope of the luminosity function below the break luminosity .",
    "given the large statistical errors in @xmath60 and the substantial systematic effect of incompleteness , we believe the value of @xmath60 is unreliable . based on the simulation",
    ", we do not believe that the break in the observed luminosity function at @xmath61 erg s@xmath13 is due to incompleteness ; however , the systematic uncertainty due to incompleteness increases the total errors in @xmath58 to about a factor of two .",
    "the break luminosity measured for ngc 1553 is about twice the eddington luminosity for spherical accretion of hydrogen dominated gas onto a 1.4 @xmath2 neutron star .",
    "therefore , it may be that the sources with luminosities much higher than the break are accreting black holes , and those below the break are predominately neutron stars in binary systems .",
    "a broken power - law was also used to fit the luminosity function of the sources derived from _",
    "chandra _ data of ngc  4697 ( sarazin , irwin , & bregman 2000 ) .",
    "the break luminosity found for this galaxy ( @xmath62 erg s@xmath13 ) is similar to that of ngc  1553 .",
    "the fit to ngc  4697 , scaled by the optical luminosity ( ngc  1553 is 2.04 times brighter than ngc  4697 in the b - band ) is shown as a dashed line plotted over the luminosity function in figure  [ fig : lumfunc ] .",
    "the cumulative luminosity function of ngc  1553 is higher at the bright end , and lower at the faint end . at the bright end ,",
    "the two luminosity functions agree within the errors , including the systematic error in the number of background sources . at the faint end",
    ", they disagree significantly .",
    "this is certainly due , at least in part , to incompleteness in the luminosity function of ngc  1553 at the faint end .",
    "the luminosity limit for the ngc  4697 observation is about a factor of four fainter than in ngc  1553 .",
    "we determined the @xmath63 ratio for ngc  1553 , where @xmath64 is the x - ray luminosity in the @xmath1 kev band for the resolved and estimated unresolved sources within two effective radii , and @xmath65 is the b - band luminosity within two effective radii .",

    "@xmath64 is dominated by the unresolved sources , and its accuracy is therefore limited by how well we can estimate the contribution to the diffuse emission from the unresolved sources .",
    "another question is whether the number , or total luminosity , of lmxbs scales with the optical luminosity of the galaxy . given that lmxbs represent an old stellar population , it might be that they scale with the bulge luminosity , rather than the total luminosity , in s0 galaxies .",
    "an even more intriguing idea is that all or most lmxbs may have formed in globular clusters ( white , kulkarni , & sarazin 2001 ) .",
    "thus , the number of lmxbs may scale with the number or total luminosity of globular clusters .",
    "scaling either with the bulge luminosity or population of globular clusters would lower the expected number of fainter lmxbs in ngc  1553 relative to ngc  4697 , and might explain the observed difference in their @xmath63 ratios .",

    "thus , the diffuse emission is rather soft , while the resolved sources dominate the hard x - ray band .",
    "the diffuse component is much softer than the discrete sources ( see   [ sec : spectra ] ) , consistent with it being composed at least partly of hot gas rather than only unresolved x - ray binaries .",
    "based on the counts from the diffuse component in the soft ( 0.31.0 kev ) , medium ( 1.02.0 kev ) , and hard ( 2.010.0 kev ) bands we estimate that 28% of the diffuse counts are from unresolved x - ray binaries .",

    "the total flux is @xmath71 erg @xmath72 s@xmath13 . the total flux from all of the resolved sources , including the bright central source , within this region is @xmath73 erg @xmath72 s@xmath13 . subtracting",
    "the two gives the diffuse flux within two effective radii of @xmath74 erg @xmath72 s@xmath13 .",
    "for deriving the fluxes , note that the spectrum fitted for the sum of the sources includes the central object and includes the objects within two effective radii only .",
    "this is so that this flux can be subtracted from the total flux to give directly the flux of the diffuse emission . to more",
    "carefully examine the spectrum of the sources in more detail , in (   [ sec : spectra ] ) , we sum the sources from the entire s3 chip to increase the number of counts in the spectrum , and we exclude the central object and object # 38 in an attempt to include only lmxbs in the spectrum . converting the fluxes to luminosities using a distance to ngc  1553 of 24.2 mpc",

    "the fluxes are all affected by the uncertainty of @xmath0 s response at low energies ( below 0.7 kev ) .",
    "the flux for the diffuse component is most uncertain because its spectrum is dominated by soft emission .",
    "we used the software package kindly provided by alexey vikhlinin ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "2000 ) to extract spectra and to determine the response matrices .",
    "the response matrices were determined from the fits embedded function ( fef ) response files fp-110_d1999 - 09 - 16fef_pin0002 , appropriate to the operating temperature of -110 c. the areas of the detector were weighted by the extracted counts in determining the response matrices . for the resolved sources , background spectra were extracted from local regions around each of the sources . for the total spectrum or the spectrum of the diffuse emission , we used a background region as far as possible from ngc  1553 but on the s3 chip (   [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "because the soft x - ray spectral response of the s3 chip was poorly known at the time when this analysis was done , we restricted our spectral analysis to the energy range 0.710.0 kev . in order to allow @xmath78 statistics to be used ,",
    "all of the spectra were grouped to at least 20 counts per spectral bin .",
    "models were fit to the spectra using xspec .",

    "2000 ) , and a softer component . in x - ray luminous early - type galaxies , the soft component is dominant , and it is clearly due to diffuse gas at a temperature of @xmath311 kev ( forman , jones , & tucker 1985 ; canizares , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1987 ) . in x - ray",

    "the _ asca _",
    "spectrum of the hard component has generally been fit by either a power - law ( characterized by a photon spectral index @xmath79 , where @xmath80 implies a photon spectrum which declines with energy ) ( allen et al .",
    "2000 ) or by a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum ( characterized by a hard component temperature @xmath81 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "the soft component in x - ray bright galaxies is usually fit by the raymond - smith ( raymond & smith 1977 ) or mekal model for the emission from a low density , optically thin plasma ( fabbiano et al .  1994 ) .",
    "this model is characterized by the temperature of the gas ( @xmath82 ) and by the abundances of the heavy elements . given the limited statistics we have in our spectra , we will assume that the heavy element abundances have the solar ratios , and only allow the overall abundance of the heavy elements to vary .",
    "in x - ray faint galaxies , it is unclear what the appropriate soft emission model should be .",
    "if the soft emission is due to diffuse gas , then the mekal model would again be appropriate .",
    "if it is due to an optically thick stellar component ( including the same lmxbs which produce the hard component ) , then it might be better represented as a blackbody , characterized by a temperature ( @xmath82 again ) .",
    "thus , we have used spectral models which include both a hard ( power - law or bremsstrahlung ) and soft ( mekal or blackbody ) component .",
    "we first determined the total spectrum ( resolved sources and diffuse emission ) from within two effective radii .",
    "the spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : spec_total ] .",
    "we tried fitting the spectrum with either a pure hard component ( power - law or bremsstrahlung ) or a pure soft component ( mekal or blackbody ) , but they did not provide an adequate fit .",
    "we allowed the absorbing column @xmath83 to vary , and found that the fit was not significantly improved ( @xmath84 ) over using the galactic column towards ngc  1553 of @xmath85 @xmath72 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "we therefore fixed the absorption to the galactic value .",
    "when the hard component is modeled by thermal bremsstrahlung , the temperature diverges and is unconstrained ( xspec imposes a limit of @xmath86 kev ) . at such high temperatures , the shape of thermal bremsstrahlung at lower energies resembles a power - law with a photon index of @xmath87 .",
    "this suggests that a power - law might provide a better fit for the hard component .",
    "indeed this is found to be the case , although the improvement is not very substantial .",
    "we list two fits in table  [ tab : spectra ] , one with the photon index a free parameter , and the other with it fixed to the value found from fitting the sources (  [ sec : spec_sources ] ) of @xmath88 since we expect that it is discrete sources that make up the hard component .",
    "the fit with the free photon index is better in the 0.710.0 kev range , however , when we expand the energy range to 0.310.0 kev and do not refit the model , the fit with the fixed photon index is much better .",
    "therefore , we use the model with the fixed photon index when determining the flux and luminosity in the 0.310.0 kev range ( the same is true for the diffuse , spiral , and circle components described below ) .",
    "we tried to fit the soft component with a mekal , blackbody ( bbody ) or disk blackbody ( diskbb ) model .",
    "the mekal model provided the best fit .",
    "the temperature of the cooler component was @xmath310.47 kev , and the abundance was @xmath310.16 .",

    "we simultaneously fit the @xmath0 spectrum of the total emission with a spectrum extracted from an identical region in the @xmath11 pspc using a model combining mekal and power - law components .",
    "the resulting fit agreed with the fits to the total emission described in table 2 within the errors .",

    "the lecs is sensitive to lower energies ( down to 0.1 kev ) than our cutoff of 0.7 kev , and sampling this low energy range has a significant effect on determining the temperature of the soft emission .",
    "in addition , trinchieri et al .  extracted their spectrum from a larger spatial region than we did .",
    "if there is a negative temperature gradient , we would expect the average temperature derived from the spectrum from this larger region to be lower .",
    "trinchieri et al .",
    "used a thermal bremsstrahlung model to fit the hard emission component .",

    "the hard component in the diffuse emission may be due to unresolved lmxbs below the limit of detection as discrete sources .",
    "we determined the spectrum of the sum of all of the resolved sources on the s3 chip , excluding the central source and source # 38 .",
    "38 is likely an unrelated background source and we therefore exclude it when extracting the spectrum of the sum of the sources .",
    "several pieces of evidence point towards the central source being an agn rather than an lmxb like most of the other discrete sources , so we analyze its spectrum separately in   [ sec : spec_agn ] .",
    "we achieved the best fit to the spectrum by using a model combining a soft , blackbody component , and a hard , power - law component .",
    "the f - test showed that the fit including both a soft and hard component was better than a fit with just a hard , power - law component at a significance level of 96% .",
    "when a mekal model was used for the soft component , the abundance and temperature were very poorly determined , and there is no real evidence for line emission in the spectrum .",

    "this photon index is consistent with that seen for weak line radio galaxies and liners ( e.g. , sambruna et al .",

    "[ fig : xwhole ] , [ fig : xsmooth ] ) , we determined its spectrum .",
    "a spatial region was constructed which covered the feature as seen in figure  [ fig : xsmooth ] , but excluding the central source and other resolved sources . in order to compare this feature with the surrounding diffuse emission",

    "the circular region which excludes the spiral emission has a photon index consistent with that of the sources .",
    "the high abundance indicated by the fit of the spiral component with the photon index fixed to the source value is the result of trying to fit the lines at high energies where the model continuum is lower than in the fit with the inverted power - law .",

    "the abundance measured with the fit using the free photon index is consistent with the abundance measured for the circular , total , and diffuse regions",
    ". the excess hard emission in the spiral region may be non - thermal , inverse compton radiation resulting from a shock .",
    "a high - resolution radio map would be useful in determining more definitively the origin of this emission .",
    "in principle , the central x - ray source in ngc  1553 might be due to one or several lmxbs and/or to a central agn .",
    "however , previous observations in other wavebands indicate that it is an agn , and our x - ray observations support this picture .",
    "ngc  1553 is a weak radio source ( 10 mjy at 843 mhz ; harnett 1987 ) , with a liner - like optical emission spectrum ( phillips et al .",
    "the x - ray evidence that suggests the central source is an agn follows .",
    "first , the position of this source agrees with the position of the optical nucleus of the galaxy to within the errors .",
    "second , its luminosity is @xmath106 erg s@xmath13 , which would make it an extremely luminous x - ray binary .",
    "this luminosity corresponds to the eddington limit for spherical accretion by a @xmath107130 @xmath108 compact object . while such luminous , high mass , presumably black hole binaries may have been found in star formation regions in spiral galaxies ( e.g. , kaaret et al .",
    "2000 ) , it seems unlikely that they would occur in lmxbs .",
    "third , the central source has a harder x - ray spectrum than is typical of the other resolved sources in this galaxy , as shown both by its hardness ratios (   [ sec : hardness ] ) and its detailed x - ray spectrum (   [ sec : spec_agn ] ) .",

    "2000 ) . based on a lower spatial resolution _",
    "hri x - ray image , trinchieri et al .",
    "( 1997 ) argued for an association of a region se of the nucleus of ngc  1553 seen in h@xmath109 emission with a region of enhanced x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray region noted by trinchieri et al .",
    "is apparently the extension to the se in figure  [ fig : xsmooth ] .",
    "we agree with this association of the x - ray emission with h@xmath109 emission . on the other hand",
    ", there is no corresponding h@xmath109 feature associated with the extension to the nw , and , on smaller scales near the center of the galaxy , h@xmath109 emission is not aligned with the `` spiral feature . '' a north - south dust lane , approximately 3@xmath28 across , is seen with hst at the center of the galaxy ( quillen et al .",
    "it runs approximately perpendicular to the spiral region , and has no correlation with any of the x - ray emission features .",
    "the position angle of the dust lane seems to approximately agree with that of small - scale h@xmath109 emission at the center of the galaxy ( trinchieri et al .",
    "overall , there is nt much evidence for a strong correlation of the x - ray morphology with cooler gas and dust .",
    "we now consider the origin of the `` spiral feature '' seen in x - rays near the center of ngc  1553 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : xwhole ] & [ fig : xsmooth ] ) .",
    "the hardness ratios , or `` colors '' for these regions are indistinguishable from those of the diffuse emission as a whole , and the emission is predominately soft ( approximately 70% of the counts fall in the 0.31.0 kev energy band ) .",
    "spectral fits (   [ sec : spec_spiral ] ) show that the gas forming the spiral feature has approximately the same temperature , abundance , and absorbing column as the surrounding gas",
    ". we also determined the average x - ray surface brightness enhancement of the spiral feature compared to the surrounding diffuse emission , using a number of regions to collect counts from the feature and from a circular region which just enclosed it . in the 0.310 kev band ,",
    "the spiral feature has an average surface brightness enhancement of 1.82 compared with the emission immediately surrounding it .",
    "we converted this surface brightness contrast into a density contrast , assuming the best - fit spectra for the spiral and surrounding gas , and for two simple geometries .",
    "first , we assume that the extent of the spiral feature along the line of sight is comparable to its width ( e.g. , it is a narrow filament ) on the plane of the sky ( an angle of approximately 35@xmath110 ) . in this case , the spiral gas is denser than the surrounding material by an average factor of @xmath111 . as an alternative , we assume that the extent of the spiral feature along the line of sight is comparable to the distance from the nucleus of the galaxy ( e.g. , it is a sheet of enhanced emission )",
    ". this sheet geometry may require that we are observing the system at a preferred angle ( along the sheet ) , or that it be part of a limb - brightened structure .",
    "for this geometry , the density contrast of spiral gas is an average factor of about @xmath112 .",
    "first , we consider the possibility that this feature is due to absorption ; that is , the spiral is not an emission feature , but the result of excess absorption in the surrounding region .",
    "in fact , the spectral fits indicate that there is not enough excess absorption in the surrounding region to provide a significant surface brightness enhancement for the spiral .",
    "also , if the required excess absorption were due to cooler gas , one might expect the spiral feature to be surrounded by optical emission lines or dust absorption ; neither is the case (   [ sec : halpha ] ) .",
    "it also seems improbable that absorption in the surrounding gas would produce such a well defined spiral feature .",
    "second , x - ray enhancements might be due to the interaction between hot x - ray emitting gas and cooling material , leading to the evaporation of the cooler material ( kim 1989 ; sparks , macchetto , & golombek 1989 ; macchetto et al .",
    "1996 ; sparks 1997 ) .",
    "this model for the spiral feature would require that there be a very close association with optical emission line gas and/or dust .",
    "as noted above (   [ sec : halpha ] ) , no such association is seen in ngc  1553 .",
    "third , the spiral features might be tidal in origin . in support of this idea ,",
    "we note that ngc  1553 is interacting with the companion elliptical galaxy ngc  1549 .",
    "there are shell or tidal features seen in ngc  1553 ( malin & carter 1983 ; bridges & hanes 1990 ) , but all are at large radii .",
    "there are no distortions apparent in the hst optical image of ngc  1553 which are associated with the spiral feature , or which are located at similar radii .",
    "if the spiral feature was due to gravitational tides , one would expect the stars to show a similar effect .",
    "fourth , the spiral might be due to gas which is radiatively cooling , and then being sheared as a result of slow rotation . in x - ray bright early - type galaxies , the cooling time is short in the central regions , and the gas is believed to form a cooling flow ( e.g. , sarazin 1990 ) .",
    "we estimate the radiative cooling time of gas in the spiral region . using the peak surface brightness of the spiral region of @xmath113",
    "ct pixel@xmath13 s@xmath13 , along with the best fitting spectral model , we determine the approximate density of this region for both the filamentary and sheet - like geometries . for the filamentary ( sheet )",
    "geometry , we estimate the density corresponding to the peak in surface brightness as @xmath114 ( 0.019 ) @xmath115 . the isobaric cooling time is then @xmath116 yr for the filamentary ( sheet )",
    "this is much shorter than the probable age of the system , so it is likely that the gas in the spiral is cooling , unless some other source of energy is replacing the radiative losses .    in this case",
    ", we would expect the gas in the spiral feature to be cooler than the surrounding gas .",
    "the spiral component has a best fitting mekal temperature of 0.51@xmath117 kev and that of the circular region is 0.48@xmath118 kev .",
    "the ratio of the temperature in the spiral region to the temperature of the surrounding region is then @xmath119 at a 90% confidence level . obviously , this does nt rule out the spiral gas being cooler than the ambient gas . on the other hand ,",
    "the radiative cooling time is much longer than the dynamical time for the gas , @xmath120 .",
    "thus , one would expect the cooling gas to be nearly in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding .",
    "if we take the lower limit of the temperature contrast of @xmath121 , and use density contrasts derived above , we find a minimum pressure ratio of @xmath122 for the long ( sheet ) geometry and @xmath123 for the narrow ( filament ) geometry .",
    "other sources of pressure support , such as magnetic fields , would only increase this limit further .",
    "thus , it seems unlikely that the gas in the spiral feature in in pressure equilibrium .",
    "another concern is the large contrast between the cooling time and the dynamical time in the gas .",
    "it seems unlikely that the spiral structure could be maintained while the gas cooled .",
    "this would probably require a very small but nonzero rotation and some other mechanism , such as magnetic fields , to stabilize the cool gas regions against infall or being sheared away .",
    "it is also difficult to understand why the feature would be two armed and relatively symmetric if it were due to radiative cooling of random perturbations in the ambient gas .",
    "the sum of the evidence suggests that it is unlikely that the spiral feature is due to cooling .",
    "next , we consider the possibility that the spiral region is due to adiabatic compression ; if we ignore magnetic fields or other pressure sources , adiabatic compression requires that @xmath124 . for the density contrast associated with a filamentary ( sheet - like ) geometry",
    ", this implies a temperature contrast of @xmath125 ( 1.22 ) .",
    "the observed temperature contrast is consistent with adiabatic compression for a sheet - like geometry , but not for the filamentary geometry .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility that the spiral features are shocks .",
    "again , we assume an ideal gas , with no magnetic fields or other sources of pressure",
    ". then , the temperature increase @xmath126 and shock compression @xmath127 are related by ( markevitch , sarazin , & vikhlinin 1999 ) @xmath128^{1/2 } \\cr -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\gamma+1}{\\gamma-1}\\left(\\frac{t_{sp}}{t}-1\\right ) , \\label{eq : shock1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath129 . from the spectrally - derived upper limit on the temperature contrast of @xmath130",
    ", we find an upper limit to the compression @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , a simple shock model using a sheet - like geometry can explain the increase in surface brightness , although a filamentary geometry can not .",
    "the velocity discontinuity @xmath132 at the shock is given by ( markevitch et al .",
    "1999 ) @xmath133^{1/2 } \\ , , \\label{eq : shock2}\\ ] ] where @xmath134 is the mean mass per particle in terms of the mass of the proton @xmath135 . for the upper limit temperature increase ,",
    "the velocity change at the shock is @xmath136 km s@xmath13 , and the shock velocity relative to the ambient gas is @xmath137 km s@xmath13 .",
    "thus , it seems most likely that the spiral feature results from subsonic or moderately transonic compression of the ambient gas in the region .",
    "the gas is required to be in a sheet rather than a filament .",
    "the required velocities are comparable to orbital velocities in the galaxy , so it is possible that the spiral feature is a shell , similar to the stellar dynamical shell seen in the optical in the outer part of ngc  1553 .    on the other hand , the spiral feature might be a part of a limb - brightened shell of gas compressed by expanding radio lobes from the radio nucleus ( harnett 1987 ) . since the lifetimes of radio sources ( typically , @xmath138 yr ) are shorter than the cooling time of the gas , this model can explain why the gas has been compressed without significant radiative cooling .",
    "similar shells have been seen in several cooling flow cluster central galaxies ( mcnamara et al .",
    "2000 ; fabian et al .  2000 ) .",
    "this would explain the nearly symmetric geometry ( i.e. , why it is present on both sides of the nucleus ) .",
    "the required radio jets and lobes would extended in a direction perpendicular to the dust and h@xmath109 disk near the center of the galaxy ( trinchieri et al .",
    "1997 ; quillen et al .",
    "the geometry has been seen in other radio galaxies ( e.g. , mcnamara et al .",
    "2000 ) , and is consistent with the dust lane being the outer portion of an accretion torus around the agn , with the radio jets emerging along the rotation axis of the torus .",
    "this model predicts that the spirals form as rims around the radio source , which must have a double jet / lobe structure .",
    "the s - shaped x - ray structure may indicate that the radio jets are not propagating along a symmetry axis of the galaxy , as it also required if the jets are perpendicular to the dust lane . in this case , each of the jets would encounter denser gas on one side , and an s - shaped structure would be produced .",
    "unfortunately , we have been unable to find a radio image of this southern galaxy which resolves the galaxy .",
    "the only information available is the approximate flux density of 10 mjy at 843 mhz ( harnett 1987 ) .",
    "upper limits at higher frequencies do not usefully limit the radio spectral index .",
    "there are several other published radio flux densities for this galaxy , however , as revealed by the harnett ( 1987 ) map , they include an unrelated bright neighboring source in the flux density measurements .",
    "the radio source associated with the nucleus of ngc  1553 is rather faint , and may be too weak to affect the hot interstellar gas in ngc  1553 enough to produce the spiral features . to test very crudely this idea , we assume that the radio source has displaced two spherical regions of thermal gas , each with a diameter of 30 .",
    "we assume that the minimum pressure in the radio source is the estimated thermal pressure in the spiral feature assuming the `` sheet '' geometry , @xmath139 dynes @xmath72 .",
    "then , the minimum total energy content of the two radio lobes is @xmath140 ergs .",
    "the radio power at a frequency of @xmath141 mhz is @xmath142 w hz@xmath13 .",
    "if we assume that the radio spectrum is a power - law @xmath143 extending from 0.01 to 100 ghz , then the total luminosity is @xmath144 ergs s@xmath13 for @xmath145 .",
    "we assume that the radio source is powered by a jet , and that the efficiency of conversion of jet power @xmath146 into radio luminosity is @xmath147 , so that @xmath148 ergs s@xmath13 . in order to inflate the required cavities",
    ", this jet would have to operate for a time scale of @xmath149 yr .",
    "this is somewhat longer than the ages usually assumed for radio sources , so either the jet efficiency would need to be unusually low , or the radio source is presently weak but was stronger in the recent past .    as a alternative test of the radio interaction hypothesis for the spiral feature , we assume that the observed radio flux comes from the two radio cavities needed to produce the structure , and determine the minimum energy content of these lobes .",
    "in addition to the previous assumptions , we assume that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the line of sight and that the ratio of energy in ions to electrons in the radio lobes is unity .",
    "since the radio spectral index is unknown , we allow it to vary and require that the minimum radio source energy exceed that required to inflate the cavities .",
    "this requires that @xmath150 , which is an extremely steep spectrum .",
    "instead , if we assume the ratio of ions to electrons is 100 , the limit is @xmath151 .",
    "these results indicate that the radio source can explain the spiral feature only if it is far from the minimum energy or equipartition limit .",
    "both of these arguments suggest that the spiral feature can be explained by an interaction with the radio source only if the radio source is a fading remnant of previously more intense radio activity .",
    "using a @xmath0 observation of the x - ray faint s0 galaxy ngc  1553 , we have spatially and spectrally resolved the sources of its x - ray emission . a significant fraction ,",
    "approximately 70% , of the total x - ray counts in the 0.310.0 kev band are detected as diffuse emission and 49 discrete sources are resolved .",
    "the diffuse emission dominates at soft energies , making up 84% of the counts from 0.31.0 kev , while the resolved sources make up most of the hard emission with 61% of the counts in the 2.010.0 kev band .",
    "we estimate that approximately 24% of the counts from the diffuse component derive from unresolved lmxbs .",
    "the diffuse component is asymmetric , with extensions to the nw and se , as well as a spiral - like structure running sw to ne .",
    "these asymmetries are consistent with the diffuse emission arising at least partly from hot gas rather than only unresolved lmxbs .",
    "three of the resolved sources are coincident with globular clusters found with hst , and an additional six have apparent optical associations on the dss .",
    "the luminosities of the individual sources range from @xmath152 to @xmath153 erg s@xmath13 , with the central source being the brightest .",
    "the luminosity function of the resolved sources is well fit by a broken power - law model with a break radius of approximately twice the eddington luminosity for spherical accretion of hydrogen dominated gas onto a @xmath154 neutron star .",
    "those sources with luminosities above the break are likely accreting black holes , and those with @xmath27 below the break are probably mainly neutron stars in binary systems .",
    "the luminosity function and break luminosity are similar to that seen with _",
    "chandra _ in the elliptical ngc  4697 ( sarazin et al .",
    "thus , the break luminosity make be a general feature of the lmxb populations of early - type galaxies .",
    "the break luminosity could be used as a distance indicator , although it is unlikely to be competitive with other techniques , given the large errors associated with the relatively small number of bright lmxbs . in any case , these lmxbs provide a new window on the stellar evolution of early - type galaxies , which is particularly useful for studying the massive stars which were present in these galaxies long ago but which have long since vanished from the optical band .",
    "the composite x - ray spectrum of the resolved sources is best fit with a two component model combining soft blackbody emission with @xmath155 kev , and a hard , power - law component with a photon index @xmath95 .",
    "the luminosity of the sources is dominated by the hard emission .",
    "the weakness of the soft emission from the lmxbs suggests that it is unlikely that they dominate the soft emission seen in the x - ray faint galaxies ( fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1994 ) as has been suggested by two of us ( irwin & sarazin 1998a , b ) .    the strongest source in the field",
    "is located at the center of ngc  1553 to within 05 .",
    "the luminosity ( @xmath156 erg s@xmath13 ) of this source is rather high for an lmxb .",
    "the spectrum of this source is very different than that of the lmxbs in the galaxy .",
    "it has a hard spectrum with a very high absorbing column .",
    "this adds to the evidence that the central source is due to the central agn in this galaxy , which is a radio source ( harnett 1987 ) with a liner - like optical emission spectrum ( phillips et al .",
    "1986 ) .    for the x - ray spectrum of the diffuse emission and of the total ( sources plus diffuse )",
    "emission , the best fit was achieved with a model combining a soft mekal component , with a temperature @xmath157 kev and abundance approximately 10% solar , along with a hard , power - law component . in this case",
    ", the soft component is dominant .",
    "the total and diffuse spectra show soft x - ray lines complexes which indicate that most of the diffuse emission is due to hot diffuse gas .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing new result from this observation is the spiral feature in the diffuse emission near the center of the galaxy .",
    "we consider several models for the origin of the spiral feature including absorption , thermal evaporation of cooler material , tidal effects , cooling , adiabatic compression , and shocks .",
    "radiative cooling and shear might explain the feature , although the spectral evidence is not consistent with this .",
    "it seems most likely that this feature is due to adiabatic or shock compression of ambient gas .",
    "we suggest that the spiral is gas which is compressed at the edges of two radio lobes .",
    "this is consistent with the radio axis being perpendicular to the dust lane in the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , there is no high resolution radio image of this southern galaxy ; thus , we are in the unusual situation ( previous to @xmath0 , at least ) of having much higher resolution x - ray than radio data .",
    "the radio flux is low enough that energetic arguments suggest that the spiral feature can be explained by an interaction with the radio source only if the present - day source is a fading remnant of previously more intense radio activity .",
