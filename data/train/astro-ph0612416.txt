    "a well known view of the globular - cluster halo is that it consists of an old halo and a young halo whose clusters have different hb morphologies that can be interpreted as an age difference ( zinn 1993 ) .",
    "the two systems are to some extent coterminous but the clusters whose r@xmath8 @xmath9 6 kpc all belong to the old halo , while the young halo predominates in the outer parts of our galaxy .",
    "recent analyses of cluster ages ( rosenberg et al . 1999 ; de angeli et al . 2005 ) show that the most metal - poor clusters are all older and coeval while the more metal - rich are younger and have a significant dispersion in age .",
    "the outer parts of the galaxy show a somewhat larger dispersion in cluster age .",
    "the old halo system has a prograde galactic rotation while that of the young halo is retrograde .",
    "the old halo clusters have a high ratio of blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) to rr lyrae ( rrl ) stars . layden ( 1996 ) found that the field rrl stars with 3 @xmath10 r@xmath11 6 kpc were not kinematically as cool as the old halo clusters since they have a larger velocity dispersion and a milder prograde galactic rotation .",
    "layden also analysed the radial velocities of the rrl stars with @xmath12z@xmath12 @xmath13 5 kpc and whose r@xmath8 projected on the plane were between 6 and 10 kpc ; these showed a marginally retrograde rotation .",
    "he accounted for these results in terms of the preferential destruction of the redder - hb clusters in the inner halo and by these redder - hb clusters having a greater fraction of rrl stars per unit luminosity .",
    "borkova and marsakov ( 2003 ) analyzed the space - motions of local rrl stars and also found evidence for two metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath9@xmath141.0 ) systems .",
    "one ( corresponding to the old halo ) is associated with blue - hb clusters and has a spherical distribution and a slightly prograde galactic rotation .",
    "the other ( corresponding to the young halo ) is more spatially extended , is associated with red - hb clusters and has stars on eccentric and retrograde orbits . a correlation between the kinematics of globular clusters and their oosterhoff type",
    "was pointed out by van den bergh ( 1993 ) and also by lee & carney ( 1999 ) .",
    "they found that oosterhoff type ii clusters belong to an older system with prograde orbits while oosterhoff type i clusters to a younger ( accreted ) system on retrograde orbits .",
    "lee & carney associated the field rrl stars with @xmath12z@xmath12 @xmath9 3 kpc and @xmath12z@xmath12 @xmath13 5 kpc with oosterhoff types ii and i respectively .",
    "the discovery of the disintegrating sgr dwarf galaxy ( ibata , gilmore & irwin 1994 ) gave very strong support to the idea that the outer field - star halo parallels the young cluster halo and is composed of the tidal debris from such accreted satellites .",
    "this has prompted searches for other satellites and consequent non - uniformities in the structure of the halo .",
    "surveys to discover such substructure include among others , a k - giant survey ( morrison et al .",
    "2000 ) , an apm carbon star survey ( totten & irwin 1998 ; totten , irwin & whitelock 2000 ; ibata et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) for a stars ( yanny et al . 2000 ) and rrl stars ( ivezi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "all have shown inhomogeneities in the distribution of stars in the outer halo that are mostly debris from the sgr dsph ( newberg et al .",
    "more recent work with sdss data has shown that these `` streams '' and overdensities are very extensive ( lupton et al . 2005 , belokurov et al .",
    "many of these surveys study the _ distant _ halo : 88% of the large sample of bhb stars discovered by sirko et al .",
    "( 2004a ) in the sdss lie beyond 10 kpc and only 4 of these stars lie within 6 kpc .",
    "thus , since proper motions are largely lacking for these stars , what we know of their kinematics can only come from analyzing their radial velocities ( sirko et al .",
    "2004b ; thom et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the kinematics of the _ local _ halo is much better known because accurate proper motions are available ( martin & morrison 1998 ; maintz & de boer 2005 ) .",
    "the mean halo rotation in the solar neighbourhood is close to zero ( i.e. @xmath15 220 km s@xmath7 ) or is slightly prograde , and it is well established that the velocity dispersions in the local halo are non - isotropic ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "helmi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) studied 97 metal - deficient ( [ fe / h]@xmath10@xmath141.6 ) red - giants and rrl stars within 1 kpc of the sun and found that about @xmath010% of these had space - motions that showed that they came from a single disrupted satellite .",
    "this has been confirmed with a larger sample ( 234 stars within 2.5 kpc of the sun ) by kepley et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who also found evidence for two other possible  streams \" .",
    "one of the first indications of structure in the halo was the discovery of retrograde motion for a group of subdwarf halo stars in selected area ( sa ) 57 at the north galactic pole ( ngp ) by majewski ( 1992 ) .",
    "later , majewski , munn & hawley ( 1996 ) found that these halo stars were clumped in phase - space and [ fe / h ] ; in particular , they found a retrograde group ( @xmath17  kms@xmath7 ) with [ fe / h ] @xmath9 0.8 moving towards the galactic plane .",
    "kinman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also found a preponderance of negative radial velocities ( i.e. motion towards the plane ) among bhb and rrl stars in the same area of the sky .",
    "a detailed analysis of the sgr stream of debris using 2mass m - giants ( majewski et al . 2003 ; law , johnson & majewski 2005 ) shows that the sgr stream may be inflowing from the general direction of the ngp towards the solar neighbourhood .",
    "martnez - delgardo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have identified the sgr leading arm with the overdensity in virgo and predict highly negative radial velocities in the north galactic cap but not at the area of the pole itself . on the other hand , neither carney ( 1999 ) nor chiba & beers ( 2000 ) find retrograde motion among different samples of nearby halo stars whose z@xmath18 @xmath19 4 kpc .",
    "vallenari et al . ( 2006 ) used the padova galaxy model to analyse the proper motions in a 26.7 deg@xmath20 near the ngp .",
    "their halo component ( for z @xmath9 7 kpc ) showed no significant rotation and had non - isotropic velocity dispersions .",
    "the colour distributions of their halo stars suggest that they are primarily redder ( @xmath21 @xmath19 + 0.5 ) giant stars .",

    "( 2005 ) who discuss the debris from the globular cluster @xmath22 cen ( probably the nucleus of a disrupted dwarf galaxy ) .",
    "the orbit discussed by chiba & mizutani does not rise more than 4 kpc above the plane in the direction of the ngp and so this debris is probably not connected with the substructure observed by majewski et al .",
    "( 1996 ) but might account for a halo overdensity of f and g stars observed by gilmore , wyse & norris ( 2002 ) .",
    "duffau et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have found a clump of both rrl and bhb stars at about 20 kpc that is coincident with an overdensity of f - type stars that were previously found by newberg et al .",
    "juri et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have found a significant overdensity of halo stars at 7 to 8 kpc in virgo although a search by brown et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for overdensities of bhb stars out to 9 kpc gave negative results .",
    "clewley & kinman ( 2006 ) have identified two new clumps that contain both rrl and bhb stars at distances of 8 and 9 kpc .",
    "there is therefore considerable evidence that structure exists in the nearby halo but accurate proper motions and radial velocities are needed in order to establish its significance .    this paper ( a continuation of kinman et al .",
    "1996 , 2003 , 2005 ) derives space motions for 117 bhb and rrl stars in @xmath0200 deg@xmath20 in the direction of the ngp .",
    "the sample of bhb stars in sa 57 that comes from the case low - dispersion sky survey ( sanduleak 1988 ) and that was discussed by kinman , suntzeff & kraft ( 1994 ) has been expanded to cover about six palomar schmidt sky survey fields ( fig .",
    "1 ) using sources discussed in sec .",
    "the rrl stars in the same area of the sky have also been included and in many cases re - observed .",
    "a data - base containing full details of these stars is in preparation ( kinman et al .",
    "bhb and rrl stars continue to be recognized as prime halo tracers ; recent surveys for them include sirko et al .",
    "( 2004a ) , vivas et",
    "al . ( 2001 ) ; clewley et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2004 , 2005 ) ; brown et al . ( 2003 , 2004 , 2005 ) ; christlieb , beers & thom ( 2005 ) .",
    "red giants , subgiants and subdwarfs are more broadly representive of the halo but can be more difficult to separate from their disk counterparts and estimates of their distances are commonly less exact than those of the hb stars .",
    "a major reason for studying the halo in the galactic polar regions is that the confusion between disk and halo stars is minimized in these directions ; this is particularly important for the rrl stars which have a significant disk population .",
    "the galactic extinction is also minimal .",
    "further , kepley et al . (",
    "2006 ) have shown that streams may be more easily identified by their radial velocities at the poles .",
    "much previous work has depended on analyses of radial velocities alone .",
    "surveys for distant halo stars tend to be made at high galactic latitudes well away from the apex and antapex of galactic rotation ; the galactic rotation component of the radial velocity is small compared with the random velocity components in these directions .",
    "consequently halo galactic rotations are not well determined from the radial velocity alone . at the galactic poles , the relation between the galactic velocity vectors u , v and w of a star and its distance , radial velocity and proper motion is particularly simple .",
    "the u and v motions depend essentially only on the distance and proper motions while the w motion depends almost entirely on the radial velocity . in principle therefore , an analysis of the errors is more straightforward in the polar regions ( and also along the prime galactic meridian ) than in other directions .",
    "it follows that it is not only important to get the best possible distances , radial velocities and proper motions , but have a realistic assessment of their uncertainties .",
    "we feel that the proper motions that we have used ( derived from the gsc - ii database ) are the best currently available . we have estimated their errors from the proper motions of qso in the same fields .",
    "presumably , the best proper motions will come from astrometric space missions such as gaia and sim ( see e.g. gaia , concept and technology study report 2004 , table a.4 ) , but it will be several more years before these are available .",
    "the majority of our radial velocities are of high quality ( @xmath2310 km / s ) ; there are some of lower accuracy but these do not significantly affect the conclusions of this study .",
    "finally , the database itself is not complete and it is hoped that it can be continually updated . in particular , it would be valuable to include the halo red giants in this region ( majewski 2005 ) .",
    "clearly this study is an ongoing project rather than one where definitive results can be obtained with the current data .",
    "we present our sample of bhb and rrl stars and the data used for this study in sect .",
    "2 ; we discuss our analysis and results in sect . 3 , and sect .",
    "4 contains the summary and our conclusions .",
    "our sample of halo tracers consists of 79 bhb and 38 rrl stars at distances between 1.5 and 16 kpc located in an area of approximately @xmath24 near the ngp .",
    "this area , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fields ] , is the combination of 7 poss - i fields where proper motions from the gsc - ii database were measured .        the bhb stars of our sample were selected from the surveys of sanduleak ( 1988 ) , beers et al .",
