    "reaction dynamics at low incident energies is mainly governed by attractive mean field which prompts the emission of particles into the backward hemisphere , whereas at higher incident energies , due to the dominance of repulsive binary nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions , particle emission takes place into the forward hemisphere . while going from the low to higher incident energies ,",
    "the in - plane flow of particles , also known as collective transverse flow , disappears at a particular energy .",
    "this particular value of energy is called the energy of vanishing flow ( evf ) or alternatively , the balance energy ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "extensive investigations have been done to calculate the accurate value of @xmath0 in the last 2 - 3 decades , both experimentally as well as theoretically @xcite .",
    "the balance energy is found to be very sensitive towards the nuclear matter equation of state , nn cross - section @xcite , size of the system @xcite , impact parameter @xcite , mass asymmetry of the reaction @xcite and incident energy of the projectile @xcite .",
    "the mass dependence of balance energy is found to obey the power law behavior ( @xmath1 ; where @xmath2 is the mass of projectile+mass of target ) and @xmath3 = -1/3 has been reported in the literature @xcite , whereas recent attempts suggested a deviation from the above mentioned power law @xcite .    in one of the recent studies , goyal and puri @xcite found for the first time ,",
    "the role of the mass asymmetry of reaction ( defined as @xmath4 = @xmath5/@xmath6 ; where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the masses of the target and projectile , respectively ) on @xmath0 and its mass dependence .",
    "it has been found that almost independent of the system mass as well as impact parameter , for large asymmetries ( @xmath9 ) , the effect of asymmetry can be 15% with momentum dependent interactions .",
    "it is well mentioned in the literature that the @xmath0 increases approximately linearly as a function of impact parameter for symmetric reactions ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the linear behavior depends upon the nuclear equation of state @xcite , mass of the system @xcite as well as the mass asymmetry @xcite . from the isolated studies with symmetric systems",
    ", it has been found that linear behavior of @xmath0 with colliding geometry decreases with increase in system mass @xcite . for the mass asymmetric systems ,",
    "the effect of colliding geometries on the @xmath0 is found for the first time by goyal @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted that the linear dependence of @xmath0 on colliding geometries increases with increase in mass asymmetry for each fixed mass of the system .    in a recent study by puri _",
    "@xcite , it has been found for the first time that while going from perfectly central collisions to most peripheral ones , the collective transverse flow passes through a maximum ( at low values of impact parameter ) , a zero value ( at some intermediate value of impact parameter ) , and achieves negative values ( at large values of impact parameter ) , at a fixed incident energy . the intermediate value of impact parameter where collective transverse flow vanishes is termed as geometry of vanishing flow ( gvf ) @xcite .",
    "it has been found that mass dependence of gvf is insensitive to the nuclear matter equation of state and momentum dependent interactions , whereas it is quite sensitive to the binary nn cross - section @xcite .",
    "it is noted that the study was done only for the symmetric systems .",
    "therefore , in the present study we aim to find the role of mass asymmetry on the gvf at a fixed value of energy .",
    "the present calculations are done with quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model @xcite , which is found to explain the experimental results of the mass and impact parameter dependence of the balance energy ( for symmetric systems ) very nicely @xcite .",
    "the model is explained in section ii .",
    "results and discussion are explained in section iii and finally we summarizes the results in section iv .",

    "it is well known that with increase in @xmath71 and impact parameter , the @xmath0 increases while with increase in @xmath2 , @xmath0 decreases .",
    "this is due to the decrease in nn collisions with increase in @xmath71 and impact parameter , and increase in coulomb repulsion with increase in @xmath2 .",
    "the present study has been done at fixed incident lab energy , therefore , the effective center - of - mass energy also decreases as @xmath71 increases for every fixed system mass . to compensate all these factors , the value of impact parameter , where flow vanishes , decreases as @xmath71 increases .    in fig .",

    "the difference in values of @xmath3 at @xmath71 = 0 is due to the variation of incident energy and mass range for which @xmath3 is calculated @xcite .    in fig .",
    "5 , we display the mean field ( @xmath89 ) and binary nn collision ( @xmath90 ) contribution of total ( @xmath72 ) as a function of the colliding geometry . as expected , ( @xmath90 ) is always positive and ( @xmath89 ) is always negative for all colliding geometries .",

    "in short , we have studied the collective transverse flow throughout the mass asymmetry range @xmath71 = 0 - 0.9 , as a function of impact parameter .",
    "study is done for different mass ranges .",
