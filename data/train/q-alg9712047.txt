    "let @xmath6 be a finite group , not necessarily commutative , and let @xmath37 be a connected , finite simplicial complex with oriented edges and faces and with a distinguished vertex @xmath38 chosen as a base point . recall the definition of @xmath39 , the non - commutative first cohomology of @xmath37 with coefficients in @xmath6 : a 1-cochain is a function from the edges of @xmath37 to @xmath6 . given a cochain and a face , let @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 be the three group elements assigned to the edges of a face in the order given by the orientation of the face , and let @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 each be @xmath46 or @xmath47 if the orientation of the corresponding edge agrees or disagree with the orientation of the face : @xmath48the cochain is a co - cycle if @xmath49 for every face ; here @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "a 0-cochain is a function from the vertices of @xmath37 to @xmath6 , and a 0-cochain is reduced if it is 1 on the base point @xmath38 .",
    "the 0-cochains form a group under pointwise multiplication with the reduced 0-cochains as a subgroup , and the coboundary operation can be understood as a group action of 0-cochains actings on 1-cochains : given a 0-cochain @xmath52 and a 1-cochain @xmath53 , if @xmath53 has the value @xmath54 at an edge @xmath55 and @xmath52 has the values @xmath56 and @xmath57 at the head and tail of @xmath55 , then the 1-cochain @xmath58 has the value @xmath59 at @xmath55 .",
    "the cohomology set @xmath39 is defined as the set of orbits of the 0-cochains acting on 1-cochains , while the reduced cohomology set @xmath60 is defined as the set of orbits of the reduced 0-cochains .",
    "the reduced cohomology is the set of group homomorphisms from @xmath61 to @xmath6 , while the full cohomology is the set of conjugacy classes of these group homomorphisms . since reduced 0-cochains",
    "act freely on 1-cochains , the number of 1-co - cycles can be computed as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the number of vertices of @xmath37 .",
    "the above analysis fully extends from simplicial complexes to polygonal complexes .",
    "polygonal complex _ is a cw complex whose 2-skeleton consists of a collection of polygons whose edges are identified to each other by homeomorphisms and whose vertices may be identified through further equivalences . a co - cycle is still defined as a @xmath6-valued function on edges such that , up to orientations , the product of the values of the edges around every face is the identity , and the conclusion that the total number of 1-co - cycles is @xmath62 still holds .",
    "removing the powers of @xmath64 by normalization , define @xmath65 to be the remaining factor @xmath66 . clearly , @xmath65 is a topological invariant .",
    "the first goal is to redefine @xmath65 in terms of the hopf algebra @xmath67 $ ] , where @xmath68 is a field of characteristic 0 .",
    "recall that the hopf algebra structure on @xmath67 $ ] consists of an algebra structure which is the linear extension of group multiplication , and an algebra structure on the dual vector space @xmath69 which is pointwise multiplication of @xmath68-valued functions on @xmath6 .",
    "recall also that the antipode map @xmath70 \\to { { \\bbb f}}[g]$ ] is the linear extension of the group inverse . let the elements of @xmath6 be both a standard basis and standard dual basis for @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath71 be the tensor corresponding to the multilinear form @xmath72 , where the trace is the trace of left ( or right ) multiplication , and let @xmath73 be the same tensor defined by the dual algebra structure .",
    "taking the indices as group elements , observe that @xmath71 is @xmath64 if @xmath74 and is zero otherwise , while @xmath75 if all @xmath76 s are equal and is zero otherwise .",
    "the fact that the matrix of an @xmath2 tensor expresses the co - cycle rule of non - commutative cohomology can be exploited as follows : assign to each edge a @xmath77 tensor with an index for each incident face , and assign to each face an @xmath2 tensor with an index for each edge .",
    "assign to each pair consisting of a face and an edge it contains either the antipode map or the identity map from @xmath67 $ ] to @xmath67 $ ] , depending on whether the orientations disagree or agree .",
    "take the tensor product of all tensors and contract according to incidence .",
    "the resulting element of @xmath68 is evidently the sum of @xmath78 over all 1-co - cycles , and therefore equals @xmath79 if @xmath37 has @xmath63 vertices and @xmath80 faces .",
    "if a polygonal cw complex @xmath37 is a cell decomposition of an oriented 3-manifold @xmath2 , an interesting symmetry appears .",
    "consider the handle decomposition of @xmath2 corresponding to @xmath37 , i.e. , thicken each face and replace each edge by a prism with a long , thin side for each incident face prism : @xmath48call the long thin sides of either kind of prism _ rectangles_. the orientation of @xmath2 is a right - hand rule , which associates a _",
    "co - orientation _ or a cyclic ordering of the rectangles of the prism of an oriented edge .",
    "working from the handle decomposition , the tensorial definition of @xmath65 associates a @xmath77 tensor to each edge prism , an @xmath2 tensor to each face prism , and either @xmath81 or @xmath21 to each rectangle .",
    "if the indices of the @xmath77 tensors are cyclically ordered according to the co - orientations , the tensorial expression is evidently invariant under an exchange of @xmath77 and @xmath2 by poincar duality . as stated , it is a well - defined formula for any finite - dimensional hopf algebra @xmath1 .",
    "it is a familiar topological invariant for a large class of co - commutative hopf algebras , namely group algebras , and it is the same invariant for a large class of commutative hopf algebras , namely dual group algebras .",
    "one might conjecture , as the author once did , that it is always a topological invariant , but this is only true when the antipode @xmath21 is an involution , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath1 is involutory .",
    "( see reference  @xcite for a proof of invariance .",
    "the involutory invariant was also independently discovered by chung , fukuma , and shapere @xcite . )",
    "a valid generalization to non - involutory hopf algebras is the subject of the rest of the paper .",
    "the definition of @xmath0 for @xmath1 involutory mandates that a rectangle be replaced with @xmath24 ( the @xmath23th power of the antipode ) , where @xmath82 is 0 if the link of the edge prism and the rim of the face prism intersect positively and 1 if they intersect negatively on the surface formed by all rectangles , which is an example of a heegaard surface .",
    "this rule is not natural ( and does not lead to an invariant ) when the exponent @xmath23 is an integer rather than an element of @xmath83 ; we must choose between all even @xmath23 or all odd @xmath23 , depending on the sign of the orientation . the solution is to consider a logarthmic lifting of the unit tangent bundle of the heegaard surface to an affine line bundle , which allows angles to take values in the real numbers rather than the circle and intersections to take values in the integers rather than in @xmath83 .",
    "unless the heegaard surface is a torus , such a lifting must be singular , but its singularities can solve other problems that arise elsewhere in the definition .",
    "a singular combing of the heegaard surface which extends to a combing of the 3-manifold can provide just such a logarithmic structure .",
    "throughout the paper , a manifold is a compact , oriented , triangulated , differentiable manifold . in addition",
    ", a manifold is assumed to have no boundary unless otherwise stated .",
    "pl and smooth constructions will be freely combined , a liberty which rarely leads to confusion in three and fewer dimensions .",
    "let @xmath2 be a 3-manifold .",
    "combing _ of @xmath2 is a non - vanishing tangent vector field , and a _ framing _ of @xmath2 consists of three linearly independent vector fields whose orientation agrees with that of the manifold . for convenience ,",
    "view @xmath2 as a riemannian manifold , a combing as a section of the unit tangent bundle , and a framing as three orthogonal sections .",
    "since the orientation of @xmath2 induces a cross - product operation on tangent vectors , it suffices to describe a framing as a pair of orthogonal sections , the third section being given by the cross product .",
    "the goal of this subsection is to classify the set of combings and the set of framings of a 3-manifold up to homotopy .",
    "it is important to describe these two sets explicitly , since the invariant @xmath0 in general depends on a combing or framing of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the proofs of lemmas  [ lcrealize ] and [ lcequiv ] depend on the classification .",
    "it is a classical result that the tangent bundle @xmath84 of a 3-manifold @xmath2 is trivial . using a trivialization of @xmath2 , which is itself a framing ,",
    "a combing becomes a map from @xmath2 to @xmath85 and a framing becomes a map from @xmath2 to @xmath86 .",
    "thus , the set of combings is bijective with the homotopy set @xmath87 $ ] and the set of framings is bijective with @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "however , for many @xmath2 , since no one trivialization of @xmath2 is completely natural , combings and framings are not canonically bijective with @xmath87 $ ] and @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "rather , it is important to understand the natural group action of @xmath88 $ ] on @xmath87 $ ] and @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "the homotopy class of a map from @xmath2 to @xmath85 is described by a _",
    "characteristic class _ @xmath89 , defined as the pullback of @xmath90 $ ] , and a _ hopf degree _",
    "@xmath53 in an affine space of @xmath91 , where @xmath23 is defined as follows : let @xmath92 be the quotient of @xmath93 by its torsion , and let @xmath94 be the image of @xmath52 under this quotient . then @xmath23 is the _ maximal divisor _ of @xmath94 , the largest integer such that @xmath95 exists in the lattice @xmath92 .    (",
    "sketch ) in general , if @xmath96 and @xmath97 are cw complexes , the homotopy set @xmath98 $ ] is approximated by the direct product of the cohomology groups of @xmath96 with coefficients in the homotopy groups of @xmath97 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath99 is the @xmath23-skeleton of @xmath96 , then restriction from @xmath99 to @xmath100 yields a map @xmath101 \\to [ x_{n-1},y]$ ] , and of course @xmath98 $ ] is the inverse limit .",
    "moreover , there is a group action of @xmath102 on @xmath103 , and each orbit of this group action is @xmath104 for some @xmath105 $ ] . in simple cases ,",
    "each @xmath106 is a surjective group homomorphism with a complemented kernel and the action of @xmath102 is free , in which case @xmath98 \\cong h^*(x,\\pi_*(y))$ ] . but the homotopy set @xmath87 $ ] exhibits a complication that arises because @xmath85 has non - trivial homotopy groups of adjacent degree .",
    "although @xmath107 , @xmath87 $ ] resembles but does not necessarily equal @xmath108 . to obtain the exact answer ,",
    "consider the fibration sequence @xmath109 where the first three terms are the hopf fibration .",
    "the terms @xmath110 and @xmath111 are classifying spaces of @xmath112 and @xmath113 viewed as groups , and they extend the hopf fibration because their loop spaces are homotopy equivalent to @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "sequence  ( [ e : hopffib ] ) would lead to the exact sequence @xmath114 \\to [ m,{{\\bbb s}}^3 ] \\to [ m,{{\\bbb s}}^2 ] \\to [ m,{{\\bbb c}}p^\\infty ] \\to [ m,{{\\bbb h}}p^\\infty]\\ ] ] if all of the terms in the sequence were groups .",
    "although three of the terms can be recognized as the cohomology groups of the 3-manifold @xmath2 and the last term is trivial , the homotopy set @xmath87 $ ] is not a group . instead , corresponding exact sequence is @xmath115 \\to h^2(m,{{\\bbb z } } )",
    "\\to 0,\\ ] ] where the second map is a group action and the first map varies according to a chosen orbit of the group action .",

    "it follows that the image of @xmath122 is generated by @xmath123 $ ] , where @xmath23 is the maximal divisor of @xmath94 .",
    "the homotopy set @xmath88 $ ] is a central extension of @xmath124 by @xmath119 .",
    "the group action of @xmath125 $ ] on @xmath87 $ ] is partly characterized as follows : the group @xmath126/h^3(m,{{\\bbb z}})$ ] has a quotient @xmath127 by the universal coefficient theorem ; let @xmath128 be the image of @xmath80 in @xmath127 .",
    "then @xmath80 acts on the characteristic class @xmath52 of an element of @xmath87 $ ] by @xmath129 , if @xmath127 is understood as a subgroup of @xmath93 . if @xmath130 , then @xmath80 acts on the degree @xmath53 of an element of @xmath87 $ ] by @xmath131 .",
    "[ pso3action ]    ( sketch ) the homotopy set @xmath88 $ ] is much easier to understand , since the non - trivial homotopy groups @xmath132 and @xmath133 are not adjacent .",
    "in general , @xmath88 $ ] is a central extension of @xmath124 by @xmath119 as a group , where the group law is defined using the lie group structure of @xmath86 . in terms of the geometry on @xmath2 , one framing @xmath134 converts a second framing @xmath135 into an element of",
    "@xmath88 $ ] , and after this conversion the @xmath124 class of @xmath135 describes its spin structure , while the @xmath119 class gives its degree .",
    "since these classes are defined relative to @xmath134 , the set of homotopy classes of framings of @xmath2 is only an affine space of the group @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "the action of @xmath88 $ ] on @xmath87 $ ] is again more complicated .",
    "there is a fibration sequence analogous to sequence  ( [ e : hopffib ] ) : @xmath136 here is an explicit description of the third map : @xmath86 is a principal bundle over @xmath85 with fiber @xmath112 , and since @xmath110 is the classifying space of the group @xmath112 , the bundle over @xmath85 induces a map @xmath137 which is the map in the sequence . in sequence  ( [ e : hopffib ] ) , the third map has degree 1 , because the hopf fibration has chern class 1 .",
    "by contrast , since @xmath86 has chern class 2 , the third map of sequence  ( [ e : so3fib ] ) has degree 2 .",
    "also , recall the familiar fact that the inclusion @xmath138 is a mod 2 reduction @xmath139 of @xmath140 .",
    "sequence  ( [ e : so3fib ] ) yields an exact sequence of homotopy sets of maps from @xmath2 , which simplifies to another mixed exact sequence of sets and groups : @xmath141 \\to h^2(m,{{\\bbb z } } ) \\to h^2(m,{{\\bbb z}}/2).\\ ] ] the action of the @xmath119 subgroup of @xmath88 $ ] on @xmath87 $ ] can be understood by recalling that the covering map and group homomorphism @xmath142 is an isomorphism of @xmath143 , and , taking @xmath144 , the group action of @xmath145 $ ] on @xmath87 $ ] induced by this homomorphism is the same as the one in sequence  ( [ e : hopffib ] ) .",
    "so this part of the action only affects the hopf degree @xmath53 .    restricting attention to the @xmath93 quotient of @xmath87 $ ] given by the characteristic class",
    ", the exact sequence further simplifies to @xmath146 where the map @xmath147 is the action of @xmath88 $ ] on the characteristic class of @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "sequence  ( [ e : twodim ] ) demonstrates that while the characteristic class @xmath52 of a map to @xmath85 is affected by the action of @xmath86 , @xmath148 is not . in terms of the geometry on @xmath2 , the class @xmath52 of a combing depends on the choice of framing , but @xmath148 does not .",
    "since @xmath148 is the pullback of the euler class @xmath149 $ ] on @xmath85 , it can be recognized as the euler class of the plane bundle which is orthogonal to the combing . to understand the extra , framing - dependent information present in the class @xmath52 , recall that the universal coefficient theorem for cohomology splits @xmath124 as @xmath150 and that the torsion product @xmath151 can be viewed as the kernel in @xmath93 of multiplication by 2 .",
    "proposition  [ pso3action ] and its proof have the following important geometric interpretation for combings of a 3-manifold with no distinguished framing : firstly , the characteristic class @xmath52 of a combing @xmath152 is defined relative to a framing , but it only depends on the affine @xmath151 quotient of the spin structure of the framing . the quantity",
    "@xmath148 is the euler class of ( the normal bundle of ) @xmath152 and is a framing - independent cohomology class .",
    "the maximal divisor of @xmath52 is framing - independent , since it is half the maximal divisor of the euler class . given two combings @xmath153 and @xmath154 with characteristic classes @xmath155 and @xmath156 relative to some framing , the difference @xmath157 , the characteristic class of @xmath153 _ relative _ to @xmath154 , is also framing - independent .",
    "if the relative class is zero and @xmath153 and @xmath154 have hopf degrees @xmath158 and @xmath159 relative to some framing , then @xmath160 is an element of @xmath91 ( and not an affine @xmath91-space ) and is framing - independent , where @xmath23 is the maximal divisor of @xmath161 .",
    "the most important combings are those that extend to framings , namely those with euler class 0 .",
    "if a framing @xmath80 consists of a combing @xmath153 and an orthogonal combing @xmath154 , the degree of @xmath80 equals the hopf degree of @xmath153 , and the spin structure comes in two pieces : a torsion product piece and a tensor product piece .",
    "the torsion product piece is the characteristic class of @xmath153 , and given @xmath153 , the tensor product piece is determined by the twist of @xmath154 in the normal bundle to @xmath153 .",
    "however , note that @xmath153 and @xmath154 play a symmetric role in the definition of @xmath80 and that they are necessarily homotopic combings",
    ".    it will be convenient to consider fictitious combings and framings with fractional hopf degree in addition to honest combings and framings .",
    "since the set of combings with a given characteristic class is an affine @xmath91-space and the set of framings with a given spin structure is an affine @xmath162-space , we can replace the former with an affine circle and the latter with an affine line .",
    "fractional combing _ is a formal linear combination with non - negative real coefficients of combings of adjacent degree with total weight 1 .",
    "a _ fractional framing _ is defined similarly .",
    "in particular , the 3-sphere @xmath113 , if interpreted as @xmath32 , has a natural left - invariant combing @xmath163 and a right - invariant combing @xmath164 .",
    "these differ by 1 in degree .",
    "the most natural combing on @xmath113 is therefore the ambidextrous one @xmath165 since it is invariant under an orientation - reversing diffeomorphism .",
    "similarly , there is a left - invariant framing @xmath166 , a right - invariant framing @xmath167 , and an ambidextrous framing @xmath168 .",
    "recall that a realization of a 3-manifold @xmath2 as a polygonal cw complex yields a handle decomposition , where the handles are prisms that meet at rectangular sides .",
    "the union of all rectangles is a _ heegaard surface _ , which is a surface that divides @xmath2 into two handlebodies .",
    "in general , given a surface @xmath169 , a handlebody with boundary @xmath169 can be described by a _ handlebody diagram _ , which is a collection of disjoint embedded circles in @xmath169 whose complement is planar .",
    "given a handlebody diagram , the handlebody is constructed by attaching thickened disks to one side of a thickened copy of @xmath169 along the circles , and then attaching balls to the spherical boundary components that result .",
    "heegaard diagram _ is then a transverse pair of handlebody diagrams on @xmath169 , and it defines a 3-manifold for which @xmath169 is a heegaard surface . by arbitrary convention ,",
    "one of the handlebodies and its circles is called upper and the other is called lower . given a polygonal cell decomposition , the perimeters of the faces are the upper circles and the links of the edges are the lower circles of a heegaard diagram on the heegaard surface of rectangles ; the diagram can also be recognized as a dissection which is dual to the tiling by rectangles : @xmath48if a circle @xmath52 in a handlebody diagram separates two distinct components of the complement of the diagram , then @xmath52 is redundant in the sense that its removal yields another handlebody diagram which describes the same handlebody .",
    "it follows that the only _ minimal _ handlebody diagrams on a surface of genus @xmath54 are those with @xmath54 circles , since only those diagrams have connected complements . unlike in reference  @xcite",
    ", most handlebody diagrams in this paper will be assumed to be minimal .",
    "note that @xmath169 admits only one minimal handlebody diagram up to homeomorphism . in this sense ,",
    "only the relative position of the two handlebody diagrams determines the topology of a 3-manifold .",
    "following reference  @xcite , three moves on heegaard diagrams suffice to render any two heegaard diagrams for a 3-manifold @xmath2 equivalent .",
    "the moves are the _ circle slide _ : @xmath48_stabilization _ : @xmath48and _ isotopy _ : @xmath48    we will need the following two well - known results concerning heegaard diagrams and their moves :    any two minimal handlebody diagrams on a surface @xmath169 for a handlebody @xmath170 are equivalent by a sequence of circle slides .

    "how isotopy and circle slides can be applied to @xmath156 , we introduce the useful trick of cutting @xmath169 along every circle of @xmath159 other than @xmath156 .",

[ section ] [ theorem]proposition [ theorem]lemma [ theorem]definition [ theorem]corollary        this paper presents a definition of an invariant @xmath0 which depends on a framed , closed 3-manifold @xmath2 and a finite - dimensional hopf algebra @xmath1 , and whose value lies in the ground field of @xmath1 . the hopf algebra @xmath1 need not be quasitriangular , triangular , ribbon , modular , a quantum deformation , involutory , or semisimple , nor does it need to have any other decoration or structural property . </S>",
    "<S> it can be any finite - dimensional example of the object defined by sweedler @xcite and drinfeld @xcite or , more generally , a finite - dimensional hopf super - algebra or a hopf object in any category which sufficiently resembles the category of finite - dimensional vector spaces . in a previous paper @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the author defined @xmath0 for involutory hopf algebras ( hopf algebras in which the square of the antipode is the identity ) and for closed and unoriented but unframed 3-manifolds . an important intermediate class of finite - dimensional hopf algebras is the class of balanced hopf algebras , for which the 3-manifold @xmath2 need only be oriented and combed rather than framed . recall that a framing of a 3-manifold is a homotopy class of linearly independent triples of tangent vectors fields . </S>",
    "<S> a combing is defined as the homotopy class of a single non - vanishing tangent vector field .    in a subsequent paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we will define the related invariant @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is a framed , closed 3-manifold , @xmath1 is a hopf algebra , and @xmath4 is a framed link in @xmath2 . more generally , the invariant @xmath5 can be defined , where @xmath6 is a framed graph in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath7 , these invariants coincide with the reshetikhin - turaev invariants of links and ribbons graphs derived from @xmath8 , the quantum double of @xmath1 . in particular , if @xmath9 is a root of unity and @xmath10 is a simple lie algebra , the reshetikhin - turaev invariants for the finite - dimensional quantum groups @xmath11 yield root - of - unity values of the familiar quantum link invariants , such as the jones polynomial , the homfly polynomial , the kauffman polynomial , and the quantum @xmath12 link invariant . </S>",
    "<S> the hopf algebra @xmath11 is almost the quantum double of @xmath13 , a truncated quantum deformation of ( the enveloping algebra ) @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a borel subalgebra of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath16 is an important special case of the invariant @xmath0 that we define here .    </S>",
    "<S> some other important special cases of @xmath0 are the following : @xmath17 by normalization , while @xmath18 is @xmath19 when @xmath1 is involutory and 0 when @xmath1 is non - involutory , and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> ( here @xmath21 is the antipode map of @xmath1 and @xmath22 is its trace as a linear endomorphism of @xmath1 . to distinguish the @xmath23th power of the antipode from the @xmath23-sphere </S>",
    "<S> , we write the former as @xmath24 and the latter as @xmath25 . ) </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath0 is multiplicative under connected sums and under tensor products of hopf algebras . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath26 $ ] is the hopf algebra of a group , @xmath0 is the number of homomorphisms from the fundamental group of @xmath2 to @xmath6 , which can be written as @xmath27| = |h^1(m , g)|$ ] . if @xmath1 is an exterior algebra with one generator , which is a two - dimensional graded hopf algebra , then @xmath28 when the right side is finite , and @xmath29 otherwise .    </S>",
    "<S> given the relation between @xmath30 and quantum link invariants , one might suspect , as the author once did , that @xmath31 includes or is equivalent to the jones - witten 3-manifold invariants , defined explicitly by reshetikhin and turaev @xcite for the group @xmath32 and by turaev and wenzl @xcite for the group @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> however , they can not be equal or equivalent up to normalization , because @xmath34 when @xmath35 ( and in general when @xmath1 fails to be semisimple and co - semisimple ) , which violates the axioms of a topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) , and the relevant hopf algebras are non - involutory . </S>",
    "<S> rather , @xmath0 should agree with another invariant recently found by kauffman and radford @xcite and considered by reshetikhin @xcite which has a dehn surgery definition similar to the definition of the reshetikhin - turaev 3-manifold invariant .    if @xmath1 is involutory and @xmath36 , then @xmath0 is a tqft . </S>",
    "<S> in this case @xmath1 must be a semisimple algebra @xcite , and @xmath0 can equally well be defined in turaev - viro style using the representation category of @xmath1 @xcite , or in reshetikhin - turaev - wenzl style using the representation theory of @xmath8 . in the semisimple case </S>",
    "<S> , the kauffman - radford invariant also equals the corresponding reshetikhin - turaev - wenzl - style invariant . </S>"
