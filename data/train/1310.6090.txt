    "perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd )  @xcite is the basic and indispensable tool for analyzing experimental data in the lhc experiments . the technique of combining an nlo - corrected hard process with a lo - level parton shower monte carlo ( replacing collinear pdfs ) , like mc@nlo @xcite and powheg @xcite , is now used in practice of the qcd calculations in the lhc data analysis .",
    "its logical extension , providing higher - precision qcd predictions , would be an nnlo - corrected hard process combined with the nlo - level parton shower monte carlo ( mc ) .",
    "however , the nlo - level parton shower monte carlo does not exist yet .",
    "in addition , the methods of nlo - correcting the hard process used in the above methodologies are quite complicated and it would be desirable to simplify them before going to the nnlo level .",
    "the authors of this note are developing solutions to both above problems .",
    "on the one hand , in refs .",
    "@xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite , they are developing a simpler method of introducing the nlo corrections to the hard process . on the other hand ,",
    "completely new techniques of nlo - correcting parton shower mc are developed , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present note",
    "we show that the technique used to simplify and speedup inclusion of the nlo corrections in the hard process , @xcite , can also be applied for the same purpose in the methods of refs .",
    "@xcite to introduce the nlo corrections in the parton shower mc . some similarities ( and differences ) to the powheg @xcite method",
    "are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the case of the hard process .",
    "for the detailed description of the methodology of nlo - correcting the parton shower mc we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite presents an older variant of the method  on the other hand , it provides many details of the differential cross sections of the nlo corrections to the ladder . the above studies and this work , are limited to the non - singlet component of the qcd evolution of the quark distributions in the hadron beam , using non - running @xmath0",
    ". the dglap evolution equation is solved _ exactly _ using a simple markovian mc with the relevant inclusive lo or lo+nlo evolution kernels .. the newly developed methods use fully exclusive ( unintegrated ) evolution kernels and their results , at the inclusive level ( evolved quark @xmath1-distributions ) , are compared with the exact inclusive mc calculation .      in eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) the summations over indices @xmath7 and @xmath8 are over the positions of the so - called `` nlo insertions '' , which upgrade one and two kernels to the nlo level .",
    "the triple and higher order summations , which are upgrading three and more kernels could be included , but we have checked that they are numerically unimportant . on the other hand , summations over ``",
    "spectator gluons '' @xmath9 and @xmath10 are important and they are regarded as a landmark of our method .",
    "( they are similar to the sums over @xmath11 non - infrared terms in the qed exponentiation scheme of ref .",
    "these sums may slow down the generation of the mc events and are rendering the evaluation of the mc weight quite complicated .    in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown how to reduce the sums @xmath12 over spectator gluons just to one or two terms , limiting these sums to contributions from one or two gluons with maximum transverse momentum , without loosing the completeness of the nlo approximation .",
    "hence , it is obvious to ask whether a similar `` trick '' is possible here , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) .",
    "the key point is to invent within the ladder kinematics some new variable which could be used to define easily a spectator gluon as the hardest one  the only one which `` saturates '' the sum @xmath12 over spectators .",
    "we can not use directly @xmath13 of the spectator , because the phase space of the nlo correction is really the two - gluon phase space  a new variable @xmath14 has to involve momenta of both gluons , the `` head '' @xmath15 and the `` spectator '' @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , similarly as @xmath17 in the hard process , it has to provide the `` sudakov suppression '' in the limit @xmath18 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinema ] we illustrate the problem and the solution in a graphical way .",
    "the solution is the following : @xmath19 the paremeter @xmath20 will provide an extra optimization in the following numerical exercises . the direction of @xmath14 is marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinema ]  it points towards the tip of the shaded triangle which marks the endpoint of the allowed phase space of the spectator gluon @xmath16 . in the essence variable @xmath21",
    "represents the rescaled @xmath17 of the spectator gluon @xmath16 .",
    "the above kinematics describes a parton shower mc with the angular ordering , however , the kinematics of the parton shower with the @xmath17-ordering is quite similar .    in the above double - gluon phase space with fixed rapidity of the head",
    "gluon @xmath15 , the sudakov phase space is 3-dimensional , ( @xmath22 ) , and the volume of the underlying 3-dimensional lo gluon phase space is equal to triple sudakov log . in the 2-dimensional visualization of this phase space gluon density in fig .",
    "[ fig : two_gluon ] we use a set of variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 in order to have a flat plateau representing manifestly the leading lo sudakov singularity .",
    "the lhs of fig .",
    "[ fig : two_gluon ] shows this sudakov lo plateau .    on the other hand , the nlo contribution plotted in the rhs of fig .",
    "[ fig : two_gluon ] clearly concentrates in the corner @xmath25 , and is manifestly free of any singularities ( it is integrable to a finite value ) .",
    "this is quite similar as in the single - gluon phase space of the hard process shown in fig .  5 in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the next step ,",
    "let us order spectator gluons ( indexed by @xmath16 ) and split the lo distribution ( similarly as in fig .",
    "6 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) into the hardest in the variable @xmath14 and the rest because the head gluon @xmath15 is just one . ] .",
    "the resulting two components are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : losplit ] .",
    "the hardest gluon distribution differs from the one in fig .",
    "6 of ref .",
    "@xcite , nevertheless it has the same property needed for nlo completeness ",
    "it reproduces well the inclusive lo distribution ( lhs plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : two_gluon ] ) in the region where the nlo contribution ( rhs plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : two_gluon ] ) is nonzero .    in view of the above",
    ", we expect that preserving only one term in the sums over @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) , from the gluon with the maximum @xmath14 , will effectively lead to nlo result within a good numerical approximation ( formally up to nnlo terms ) .",
    "we shall check this conjecture in the following .",
    "in the following we shall check numerically that taking only one or two hardest ( in @xmath26-variable ) spectator gluons in the nlo mc weight of eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) does not significantly disturb the nlo result of the qcd evolution .",
    "this is the principal result of this work .    as a warm - up exercise",
    "we reproduce the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) with summation over all spectator gluons @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : oldresult ] the total ( lo+nlo ) quark distribution evolved with single and double nlo insertion is compared with the benchmark inclusive calculation .",
    "the two are indistinguishable , and to see the difference one should look at the lower plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : oldresult ] , where the ratios of the exclusive and inclusive results are plotted for the single and double nlo insertions separately .",
    "they agree perfectly within the statistical errors .",
    "next , in the calculation presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : newresult ] , we replace the sums over spectators with the one or two terms from the hardest gluons in the variable @xmath14 , for the single gluon insertion component .",
    "as we see , this truncated result reproduces very well the previous single nlo insertion component in the evolved quark distribution .",
    "the actual difference is better seen in the lower plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : newresult ] representing the ratios of the truncated and complete sums over spectator gluons .",
    "of course , the case with two hardest spectator gluons looks better , but the single hardest gluon would be sufficient . it should be added that in the above result we have adjusted @xmath27 in the definition of @xmath14 .",
    "for @xmath28 the ratio for single spectator gluon would be @xmath29 at the low @xmath1 limit ( remaining formally all the time correct modulo nnlo corrections ) .",
    "a new methodology of adding the qcd nlo corrections to the nlo initial state monte carlo parton shower is refined and tested numerically , albeit for a limited set of the nlo diagrams and in the simplified mc model .",
    "this result presents another important step towards realistic implementation of the nlo parton shower mc , to be combined with the nnlo - corrected hard process .",

    ") are grateful for the warm hospitality of the th unit of the cern ph division , while completing part of this work .",
