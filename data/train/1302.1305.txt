    "the aim of this paper is to spell out the lhc phenomenology of a simple , unified realization of the tree - level gauge mediation ( tgm ) supersymmetry breaking scheme  @xcite . in tgm ,",
    "supersymmetry breaking takes place as usual in a hidden sector and is communicated at the tree level to the mssm fields by means of superheavy vector fields associated to a broken @xmath4 gauge group .",
    "tgm therefore requires an extension of the standard model ( sm ) gauge group @xmath5 to at least @xmath6 .",
    "the ( non - anomalous ) extra @xmath4 is spontaneously broken at a high scale @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding vector field @xmath8 acquires a mass @xmath9 , where , @xmath10 is the @xmath4 gauge coupling .",
    "if both the observable superfield @xmath11 and the supersymmetry breaking field @xmath12 , @xmath13 , are charged under @xmath4 , @xmath8 plays the role of the supersymmetry breaking messenger , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] . at the scale @xmath7 ,",
    "the sfermion @xmath14 acquires a soft mass given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the charges of @xmath11 and @xmath12 under @xmath4 .",
    "this simple way to communicate supersymmetry breaking is particularly suited to realize a simple , complete , and viable model of dynamical supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "massive vector superfield @xmath8 communicates supersymmetry breaking associated to @xmath13 to the observable field @xmath11 at the tree level . ]",
    "it is tempting to consider @xmath4 as part of a grand unified group @xmath18 . in this case",
    "the @xmath4-breaking scale @xmath7 is expected to be near the gut scale , @xmath19 .",
    "the minimal - rank choice for the grand unified group is then @xmath20 @xcite , although higher rank groups such as @xmath21 can also be considered  @xcite .",
    "the minimal choice is particularly interesting , as it gives rise to definite , peculiar predictions for the sfermion mass ratios . in this case , in fact , the @xmath4 mediating supersymmetry breaking is associated to a well defined @xmath22 generator .",
    "the sfermion charges are then known up to a normalization factor , see table  [ chap : tgm_lhc_tab : fieldcontent ] , and their squared tree - level masses , proportional to the @xmath4 charges , are predicted ( up to an overall scale factor ) , as in eq .  .",
    "the embedding of the extra @xmath4 into a grand unified group guarantees that the @xmath4 quantum numbers are the same for all families ( barring flavour dependent embeddings  @xcite ) , thus leading to a solution of the supersymmetric flavour problem . note that in standard gauge mediation , a messenger scale as high as @xmath23 could spoil such a solution of the flavour problem , as the flavour - anarchical supergravity contributions to the soft terms would only be suppressed by a relatively mild factor @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the gauge mediation loop factor . in our case , instead , the supergravity contributions are suppressed by the much stronger factor @xmath26 , which is small enough to make them harmless  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the lhc phenomenology of such a minimal unified setup , taking into account some notable theoretical subtleties which turn out to relate the gaugino mass ratios to the flavour structure of the sm fermions .",
    "in order to study the tev phenomenology of the model we only need to consider the lagrangian below the @xmath22 breaking scale . the matter field content",
    "( separated from the higgs field content by an @xmath27-parity @xmath28 ) , consists of three @xmath29 , whose sm decomposition is given in table  [ chap : tgm_lhc_tab : fieldcontent ] .",
    "the lower case fields are ( in first approximation ) the light ones .",
    "the @xmath30 are sm singlets , they may get mass at the non - renormalizable level . the other capital letter fields get mass through @xmath22 breaking .",
    "they consist of two pairs of vectorlike fields , @xmath31 and @xmath32 for each family @xmath33 and they play the role of messengers of minimal gauge mediation .",
    "we assume that only the light doublet components @xmath34 , @xmath35 of the higgs fields survive below the gut scale ( see  @xcite for an example of how to achieve that ) . if the @xmath22 higgs sector contains only representations with dimension @xmath36 ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , the doublets can only belong to @xmath37 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 representations . to be general , we allow them to be superpositions of the doublets in those representations .",
    "that is why their @xmath43 charge is not specified in table  [ chap : tgm_lhc_tab : fieldcontent ] .",
    "the goldstino superfield @xmath12 can in principle also have a ( smaller ) component in a @xmath42 , see section  [ sec : messmass ] .    .tgm field content . the @xmath22 representation to which the different superfields belong and their sm quantum numbers are shown , together with the charge under @xmath44 , the @xmath22 subgroup mediating supersymmetry breaking at the tree level , and their @xmath27-parity .",
    "the higgs fields @xmath34 and @xmath35 can belong to different @xmath22 representations , which is why we do not specify their @xmath44 charges . the field @xmath12 is the source of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "[ chap : tgm_lhc_tab : fieldcontent ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the largest sensitivity comes from the hadronic box , which collects the majority of the events originating from the production of colored sparticles .",
    "the improvement due to the leptonic boxes is marginal for the considered benchmark models .",
    "the stau and the bino models are not excluded .",
    "but the observed limit is not far from the model cross section , such that the analysis of the 8 tev data could already rule them out .",
    "the wino point is excluded , despite being the most challenging .",
    "this proves that the cross section production for ewkinos lighter than 200 gev is already probed by the 7 tev lhc data , the cross section being above 1 pb .",
    "additional sensitivity could be provided by dedicated searches for directly - produced charginos and neutralinos .",
    "the exclusion reach by the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite multilepton analyses , obtained considering the full 8 tev statistics , is not good enough to cover the benchmark models we considered .",
    "this is mainly due to the large chargino and neutralino masses and the corresponding suppression of the production cross section .",
    "these benchmark models could be probed with the next lhc run , thanks to the larger production cross section and the larger expected statistics .",
    "250  gev .",
    "]    finally , in the case in which the nlsp is the stau some bounds on its mass can be set from the searches on the heavy charged stable particles , as anticipated in section [ chap : tgm_lhc_benchs_stau ] : the stau , indeed , decays to the gravitino outside the detector .",
    "such limits in the tgm framework are in general less restrictive than those in mgm since the additive tree level contribution to stau soft mass term accounts for a comparably smaller production cross section . as shown in figure [ fig : staulim ] , the recent experimental results allows a tgm stau mass larger than 220 @xmath45 250  gev . in that plot ,",
    "we have varied @xmath46 from 450 to 1250  gev and fixed the other parameters at the values of the stau benchmark point .",
    "we studied the lhc phenomenology of a minimal unified realization of tree - level gauge mediation , in particular the possibility to test its peculiar prediction for the sfermion mass ratios .",
    "we did this in three steps .",
    "first , we provided a detailed definition of the lagrangian of the model and of the relevant parameters , taking into account the possible deviations from @xmath22 relations due to the contributions of the non - renormalizable operators necessary to fix the gut prediction for the light fermion mass ratios .",
    "then we discussed the precise determination of the low energy spectrum in terms of the above parameters .",
    "in particular , we provided analytical formulas for the rge running and a numerical implementation in softsusy .",
    "the possible deviations from gut relations turn out not to affect the tree - level predictions for the sfermion mass ratios .",
    "however , we pointed out that they can give rise to largely non - universal gaugino masses without any conflict with the unification of gauge couplings . the non - universality arises from the flavour structure of the messenger interactions . even in the limit",
    "in which the @xmath22 breaking effects are small and only significantly affect the small yukawa couplings of the first families , the effect on gaugino masses can be sizeable .",
    "this is because gaugino masses are equally sensitive to the ratio of the larger third family yukawa couplings and to the ratio of the smaller first family couplings , more likely to be affected by @xmath47 effects . as a consequence of the possible non - universality of gaugino masses ,",
    "the wino can be lighter than the bino .",
    "still , gaugino masses satisfy a sum rule , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule ] ) , which can be considered as another smoking gun of minimal unified tgm .",
    "another important aspect related to the determination of the tev - scale spectrum has to do with @xmath48-terms .",
    "usually in gauge mediation no @xmath48-terms are generated at the one - loop level at the messenger scale .",
    "this is not the case here .",
    "in fact , the mssm fields and the minimal gauge mediation messengers lie in the same @xmath22 multiplets , so that the messenger - messenger-@xmath12 coupling generating gaugino masses are accompanied by matter - messenger-@xmath12 couplings generating non - vanishing @xmath48-terms at the messenger scale .",
    "the size of the @xmath48-terms depends on whether the heavier of the three families of messengers is significantly lighter than the gut scale or not .",
    "the latter case , corresponding to third family yukawas of order one in the full @xmath22 theory , gives rise to larger @xmath48-terms but is more model - dependent , as it depends on unknown details of the full @xmath22 theory . in turn , the possibility of sizeable @xmath48-terms allows to account for a @xmath49 light higgs for sfermion masses within the lhc reach . on the other hand ,",
    "the higgs mass can be raised above the mssm prediction with a suitable implementation of the nmssm setup .",
    "another interesting property of the @xmath48-terms in tgm is that only the third family @xmath48-terms are non negligible , as the first and second family are suppressed by powers of small yukawa couplings .",
    "this solves the supersymmetric cp problem .",
    "different possible types of spectra can be obtained , in particular as far as the nlsp is concerned . in tgm models ,",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle is the gravitino .",
    "the nlsp turns out to be a bino - like neutralino , a wino - like neutralino , or a stau .",
    "the possibility that the lightest neutralino is wino like is opened by the possible non - universality of gaugino masses . we have therefore considered three benchmark points representative of each of those possibilities .    finally , we studied the lhc signals associated to each benchmark point , considering in particular the possibility to test the sfermion mass ratio prediction .",
    "tgm turns out to be an interesting playground on which the performances of different searches can be compared . from this point of view",
    "we found that the razor inclusive analysis by cms was an ideal tool .    for each benchmark point",
    ", we computed the susy spectrum by running the parameters of the model from the gut to the tev scale using a modified version of the softsusy package .",
    "we evaluated the possible signatures at the lhc applying the selection of the cms razor analysis , discussing the interesting interplay between the different production processes and decay chains in the different _ boxes _ in which the razor search is defined .",
    "we also studied other interesting features of the tgm benchmark models , as for instance the long - living staus , the compressed chargino - neutralino spectrum and the large mass difference between the colored particles and the rest of the spectrum .",
    "the tgm class of models can accomodate the lack of a susy signal so far and the possibility of observing one with the 8 tev data , or with the first data collected at higher energy at the lhc restart .",
    "the work of a.r .  and m.s .",
    "was supported by the erc advanced grant no .",
    "267985 `` damesyfla '' , by the eu marie curie itn `` unilhc '' ( pitn - ga-2009 - 237920 ) and the european union fp7 itn invisibles ( marie curie actions , pitn- ga-201 - 289442 ) .",
    "part of this work was done at the galileo galilei institute for theoretical physics , which we thank for the kind hospitality and support .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss the expectations for the size of the parameters @xmath50 . as we have seen in section [ sec : messmass ] , the breaking of @xmath22 and susy must involve spinorial representations .",
    "in particular , the @xmath41 , @xmath42 fields acquire a vev @xmath7 in the scalar , sm singlet component and @xmath51 , @xmath52 acquire a vev in the @xmath53-term sm singlet component . as in section [ sec : messmass ] , we will actually assume for simplicity that only @xmath51 gets an @xmath53-term and we further assume that the @xmath41 and @xmath51 are the only spinorial representations coupling to matter bilinears . for convenience",
    "we remind the form of the most general r - parity invariant superpotential bilinear in the matter fields @xmath54 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : w2 ] ) : @xmath55 in the previous equation , a mass term @xmath56 has been assumed to be absent to obtain a `` pure '' embedding of the sm fields in @xmath22 representations and to avoid reintroducing the flavour problem  @xcite . the ( model - dependent ) non - renormalizable part",
    "is not specified but it is supposed to bring the fermion mass ratios to the phenomenologically correct values .    in order to identify the light yukawa couplings we need to specify better the embedding of the light higgs fields , deepening the discussion in section [ sec : relevantparameters ] .",
    "the light @xmath35 can be contained in the doublet component of the @xmath41 , @xmath57 , in the doublet of the @xmath51 , @xmath58 or in a @xmath37 , with the size of the total component in spinorial representations given by @xmath59 .",
    "the field @xmath35 could be in principle also be embedded in a spinorial representation different from @xmath41 and @xmath51 and not coupling to the matter bilinears , but we assume that this is not the case .",
    "we can use an angle @xmath60 to measure how @xmath35 is shared by the two spinorial representations : @xmath61 from eqs .",
    "and we can recover the sm yukawa couplings @xmath62 and @xmath63 in eq .   as follows : @xmath64 where the superscript `` nr '' denotes a correction vanishing in the limit @xmath65 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : chap_tgmeq : yukawas ] ) one can see that the simplest possible relation between the parameters @xmath66 and the mssm yukawas is obtained when @xmath35 is entirely in the @xmath41 and the non - renormalizable contributions are negligible , in which case we obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : minimalpars ] ) . in order to account for the general case ,",
    "we have introduced new parameters @xmath50 defined by @xmath67 the @xmath50 coefficients can be written in terms of the parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : chap_tgmeq : yukawas ] ) as follows : @xmath68 the equations above allow to set an appropriate range for these coefficients .",
    "in the limit in which @xmath35 lies in the @xmath41 only ( @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 at the renormalizable level . in the limit in which @xmath35 lies in the @xmath71 only ( @xmath72 ) , on the other hand , the parameters @xmath50 can be smaller , especially if the parameters @xmath73 in enhance gaugino masses .",
    "in this section we shall present the rges for the full theory below the gut scale @xcite . in all of the following equations we will use the common definition @xmath74 where @xmath3 is the renormalization scale .",
    "the rges for the gauge couplings are @xmath75 where @xmath76 and [ 1 ] @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number of @xmath79 fields and similar for the other @xmath80 .",
    "in terms of the results obtained for the gauge couplings one has @xmath81      in the following equations , the integration of the heavy chiral messengers at their mass scale is taken into account by setting to zero the corresponding entries of the yukawa matrices .",
    "we note that the part proportional to the gauge coupling does not depend on the number of flavours that are switched on since it is directly related to the specific @xmath82 parameter under study .",
    "incidentally we note that if some of the flavours are frozen out this will also act on the meaning of the various traces appearing in the equations .",

    "it is convenient to define the quantity @xmath89 as usual , below the scale where a degree of freedom is integrated out the corresponding entries in the @xmath90 matrices will vanish in @xmath91 and in the equations below .",
    "the rge equations are then [ 6 ] @xmath92      a sometimes useful simple approximation for the solutions of the rges for the soft mass terms is obtained in the limit in which @xmath93 is moderate , so that only the top yukawa coupling is relevant in the equations above , and the squared gaugino masses and @xmath48-terms are negligible compared to @xmath94 . in such a case ,",
    "the only soft terms that run significantly are @xmath95 and the stop squared mass parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 , for which we have ( see , e.g.  appendix of @xcite ) @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 a typical value of @xmath103 is @xmath104 .",
    "the razor analysis @xcite is a fairly recent approach that has been introduced by the cms collaboration to discriminate new physics signals over sm backgrounds in situations in which there is a presence of large @xmath105 .",
    "the framework is designed to perfectly fit to a situation in which from parton collisions two heavy particles ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) , whose mass is significantly larger than those of sm particles , are produced .",
    "the decays of the @xmath108 s are then forced to be described by a dijet topology , in which any of the @xmath108 decays to a massive unseen particle @xmath109 , contributing to @xmath105 , and a massless seen particle @xmath110 , being detected as a jet . in susy theories the benchmark scenario for this approach would thus be the case in which two heavy squarks are produced and then decay to a quark and a neutralino : @xmath111 for any of the decay chains @xmath112 one can define the variable @xmath113 which , in the approximation where the heavy @xmath108 s are produced at threshold and the @xmath110 s are massless , corresponds to twice the energy of the @xmath110 s in the center of mass ( cm ) frame .    the reconstruction of the cm frame in events with two undetected particles is not conceivable , but still it is possible to perform an event by event reconstruction of the specific reference frame in which the three - momenta of the observed jets coincide .",
    "this reference frame , named r - frame , is an estimator of the cm frame itself : working in it one can construct a transverse mass @xmath114 , @xmath115 whose distribution would have an edge at @xmath116 corresponding to the case in which cm and r frame coincide , and @xmath117 which peaks at @xmath116 for signal events .    given the tools described one",
    "could easily discriminate between background and signal events by means of the razor variable , defined as @xmath118 for signal events the distribution of @xmath27 peaks around @xmath119 , while for any sm background it is quite lower : this allows to discriminate between the two by means of smart cuts on the value of @xmath27 .",
