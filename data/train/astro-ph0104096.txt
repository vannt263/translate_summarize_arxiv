    "in this paper we will discuss several aspects of post - agb ( pagb ) stars in old stellar systems , in particular those in globular clusters ( gcs ) and in the halos of the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "specifically , we will discuss observations with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( ) of the planetary nebula in the gc m15 , ground - based observations of two pagb stars in the gc ngc  5986 , and ground - based searches for pagb stars in the halos of nearby galaxies and their possible application as standard candles for measuring extragalactic distances .",
    "since this work has now been published in detail ( alves , bond , & livio 2000 ) , we give only a fairly brief summary here .",
    "kstner  648 in m15 is one of just four planetary nebulae ( pne ) known in galactic gcs .",
    "it was the first to be found ( pease 1928 ) , and it was more than six decades before the other three were discovered : in m22 ( gillett et  al .",
    "1989 ) and pal  6 and ngc  6441 ( jacoby et  al .  1997 ) . as jacoby et  al .",
    "point out , this number is lower than expected if every star now evolving in a gc makes a pn .",
    "there are several lines of argument that pagb evolution in gcs is slow compared to the timescale for dissipation of a pn into space following its ejection at the tip of the agb .",
    "first , recent detections of white dwarfs in nearby gcs ( renzini et al .  1996 ; cool , piotto , & king 1996 ; richer et  al.1997 ) indicate that the remnant masses are very low ( @xmath8 ; see alves et al .",
    "2000 for details ) .",
    "pagb stars of masses @xmath9the lowest for which calculations have been made  already have theoretical evolutionary timescales that are much longer than the dissipation timescale for pne ( schnberner 1983 ; vassiliadis & wood 1994 ) , and the timescales should be even longer at masses of @xmath1@xmath2 . in support of this expectation , star counts of pagb stars in the m31 halo ( see below ) indicate quite long lifetimes for the portion of the post - agb evolution from effective temperatures of 5,000 to 10,000  k. it is thus unlikely that typical halo stars will ever be able to ionize visible pne .",
    "the question then shifts from `` why are there so few pne in gcs ? ''  to `` why are there _ any _ pne at all ? '' .",
    "jacoby et al .  ( 1997 ) proposed that the observed gc pne were formed through close - binary interactions , although they did not propose any specific mechanisms .    in order to test this hypothesis , we obtained observations of k  648 and its central star with and its wfpc2 over an interval of 7  days , in order to search for variations in the brightness of the nucleus due to heating effects in a close binary system .",
    "as discussed in our paper , we did not find any variations , and thus have no direct evidence that the nucleus is at present a close binary .",
    "however , the argument can be pressed further by considering the luminosity of the central star . by combining our accurate measurement of the star s",
    "@xmath4 magnitude with its known effective temperature ( @xmath10  k , based on spectroscopic observations cited in our paper ) , we find @xmath11",
    ". we can now compare its position in the hr diagram with theoretical pagb tracks , as shown in fig .  1 .    = 3.5 in 0.25 in    although the pagb tracks plotted in fig .",
    "1 are for solar metallicity , they still illustrate that the mass of the central star of k  648 is significantly above that of the stellar remnants currently evolving in gcs , which , as noted , are about @xmath2 .",
    "vassiliadis & wood ( 1994 ) find a pagb luminosity / core - mass relation of @xmath12 , nearly independent of metallicity , and applicable to both hydrogen- and helium - burning tracks .",
    "using this formula , we find that the mass of the k648 central star is @xmath13 ( the error estimate includes only observational errors , not any errors in the theory ) .    since the k  648 central star is more massive than the normal stellar remnants in gcs , we conclude that the progenitor experienced mass augmentation at some point in its prior evolutionary history , most likely from a close - binary interaction .",
    "a plausible scenario is one in which a close binary on the main sequence underwent a w  uma - type contact stage , followed by coalescence ( at which time it would probably have appeared as a blue straggler in the color - magnitude diagram ) . the star subsequently evolved as a more massive object than the bulk of the single stars ( which have masses @xmath1@xmath14 ) , allowing it to produce a @xmath15 remnant which evolved rapidly enough to ionize its ejected agb envelope before the envelope had time to dissipate .",
    "our detailed study of k  648 supports the hypothesis that all halo pne , including those in gcs and in the halo field , are descendants of close binaries , and that single stars in old populations do not make pne .",
    "this work has now also been published ( alves , bond , & onken 2001 ) , so again we will give only a short summary here .",
    "= -1 population  ii stars evolving off the agb and passing through spectral types f and a are the visually brightest members of old populations ( due to the behavior of the bolometric correction with effective temperature ) .",
    "these stars should have a narrow luminosity function ( lf ) , because essentially a single main - sequence turnoff mass is feeding the pagb region of the hr diagram .",
    "moreover these `` yellow '' pagb stars are easily recognized because of their enormous balmer jumps . for these reasons ( summarized in more detail by bond 1997 ) , we believe that yellow pagb stars in old populations show great promise as a new standard candle for measuring extragalactic distances , especially to early - type galaxies that contain no cepheid variables . a zero - point calibration for the luminosities of pop  ii yellow pagb stars may be set using those in galactic gcs .",
    "the little - studied southern gc ngc  5986 is remarkable because it contains two candidate a - f type pagb stars , discovered some years ago during a photographic grism survey ( bond 1977 ) .",
    "cluster membership was confirmed by their radial velocities and by strmgren photometry showing very low surface gravities .",
    "these two stars are potential primary zero - point calibrators for pagb absolute magnitudes .",
    "we have obtained ccd photometry of ngc  5986 , from which we have derived a reddening and distance modulus of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ( see alves et al .",
    "2001 for details ) .",
    "the two yellow pagb stars have the same @xmath4 magnitudes to within @xmath50.05  mag , confirming the expectation of a very narrow lf and supporting the idea that they may constitute a useful new standard candle . by including also the absolute magnitude of the bright a - type star roa  24 in the gc @xmath18  cen ( gonzlez & wallerstein 1992 )",
    ", we find a mean @xmath19 .",
    "2 shows the locations of the two pagb stars in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of ngc  5986 .",
    "= -1 we now have underway a ccd survey of about 100 galactic gcs , using our new _",
    "ubvi _ photometric system ( see below ) , in order to find more examples of yellow pagb stars and strengthen the zero - point determination .",
    "as described above , yellow pagb stars show promise as a standard candle , and are easily detectable using a photometric system that is sensitive to their large balmer jumps .",
    "we have been developing a new ccd photometric system that combines the gunn @xmath6 filter ( lying almost entirely below the balmer jump ) with the standard johnson - kron - cousins _ bvi _ bandpasses .    in a preliminary analysis of frames taken in the halo of m31 , bond and laura fullton",
    "have discovered a sequence of stars with @xmath20 and large @xmath21 color indices , which are strong candidates for pagb stars belonging to m31 .",
    "their mean @xmath4 is @xmath22 .",
    "if we use the preliminary zero - point of @xmath23 based on ngc  5986 and @xmath18  cen , as outlined above , we obtain an m31 distance modulus of @xmath24 , in reasonably good agreement with that based on cepheids and other indicators , but requiring only about an hour of 4-m telescope time !",
    "bond & fullton ( 1997 ) have also obtained _ ubvi _ frames of ngc  205 , a dwarf elliptical companion of m31 . here",
    "we find a sequence of yellow pagb stars some 0.35  mag fainter than those belonging to the superposed halo of m31 , suggesting that ngc  205 is @xmath1100  kpc further away than m31 itself ( in fair agreement with distances from pne and rr  lyrae variables , although these observations have somewhat greater uncertainties due to the small number of pne in ngc  205 and the faintness of the rr  lyr stars ) .",
    "the star counts in the m31 halo fields imply a pagb lifetime of @xmath125,000  yr ( for the portion of the evolution from @xmath25 to 0.0 only ) , confirming as noted in our comments on k  648 that pagb evolution is extremely leisurely in old populations .",
    "the luminosities of the m31 pagb candidates imply a mean mass of @xmath1@xmath26 , in reasonable agreement with the masses inferred for white dwarfs in old populations .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge support from nasa ( grant nag  5 - 6821 ) for the work on pagb stars in galactic halos , and from stsci ( grant go-6751 ) for the work on k  648 .",
    "we thank mario livio , chris onken , and laura fullton for their contributions to these projects ."
