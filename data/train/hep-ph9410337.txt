    "due to confinement , the basic building blocks of qcd , quarks and gluons , can not emerge as asymptotic states of the theory .",
    "rather the high energy quarks and gluons in a hard scattering process show up in a detector as jets of hadrons , and their axes register the momentum directions of the initial partons .",
    "the process of converting a colored parton into a shower of hadrons is called parton fragmentation , in which it has long been known that the soft qcd physics dominates . as a result ,",
    "analyzing fragmentation directly from first principles is very difficult . up to now",
    "the fragmentation process is mainly modelled with a set of empirical rules and a large monte carlo code @xcite .",
    "given the paucity of our knowledge , experimental information on various aspects of fragmentation is quite valuable for understanding the essential physics in the underlying process .",
    "semi - inclusive information about fragmentation is contained in fragmentation functions , which measure the probability for a quark to fragment to a specific hadron with a fixed longitudinal momentum .",
    "all the fragmentation functions experimentally measured so far are spin - independent . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the novel spin - dependent fragmentation functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 are introduced for spin-1/2 baryon production .",
    "both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are of leading twist and can produce significant effects in high - energy processes .",
    "the physics of these fragmentation functions is quite simple .",
    "the @xmath3 fragmentation function represents the probability density to find a spin-1/2 baryon with its polarization in the direction of the longitudinal polarization of the original quark .",
    "likewise , @xmath4 represents the probability density to find a spin-1/2 baryon with its polarization in the direction of the transverse polarization of the original quark . here ,",
    "longitudinal or transverse is defined relative to the momentum of the quark .",
    "undoubtedly , experimental data on these fragmentation functions contain important information about spin - transfer during quark fragmentation .    to measure the spin - dependent fragmentation functions , one normally needs to produce a polarized quark jet .",
    "this is possible with polarized @xmath2 collisions or polarized deep - inelastic scattering . on the other hand , in an unpolarized @xmath2 annihilation",
    ", the polarizations of the created quark and antiquark pair are correlated due to the chiral invariance of the electroweak interactions . therefore if one can find a way to measure the spin correlation of the produced hadrons",
    ", one can obtain information on the spin - dependent fragmentation functions .",
    "this observation forms the foundation for our work .    in this paper",
    ", we study the measurement of the spin - dependent fragmentation functions in unpolarized @xmath2 annihilation . for definiteness , we consider correlated production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in quark and antiquark jets respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath5 are observed by their weak decay to nucleon - pion and anti - nucleon - pion respectively .",
    "the weak decay allows one to measure the complete spin - density matrix of the parent baryon .",
    "the spin - dependent information is extracted from the angular correlation of the decay products of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "our result , of course , is valid for production of any spin-1/2 baryon which decays weakly to another spin-1/2 baryon and a pion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "ii , we write down the differential cross section as a product of the density matrices for the jet production , the quark fragmentation , and the baryon decay .",
    "we then present the helicity formalism on which the subsequent calculation is based . in  iii ,",
    "we evaluate the jet production density matrix . in ",
    "iv , the quark fragmentation density matrix is defined and expressed in terms of the fragmentation functions @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath3 , and @xmath4 . in  v , @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay density matrices are constructed . and finally in ",
    "vi , we put everything together to form the final cross section , and discuss its physical significance .",
    "we summarize our results in  vii .",
    "the reader who is interested primarily in our results and their physical interpretation might omit ",
    "iii,iv , and  v and skip directly to the formulas and discussions in  vi and  vii .",
    "the calculation of the cross section for @xmath7 can be carried out by following the standard procedure of the operator production expansion , or equivalently , by using the collinear expansion and `` cut diagram '' technique @xcite . however , since we are interested in a result at the leading twist , there is a more physical approach which employs the language of the parton model and follows the process step by step .",
    "first , we calculate the quark - antiquark production ; then , we deal with quark and antiquark fragmentations ; next , we include the @xmath0 and @xmath5 decay ; and finally , we assemble the @xmath8 production , fragmentation and decay processes together to obtain the experimentally observable particle distributions .",
    "the only subtlety in the case of a spin - dependent calculation is that all the intermediate quantities must be in a form of spin - density matrices .",
    "then the cross section is expressed as a trace of product of spin - density matrices for separate subprocesses . in our case",
    "we have , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are indices labelling spin states of quark ( antiquark ) and hyperon ( antihyperon ) , respectively . by convention ,",
    "repeated indices are summed over .",
    "the bulk of this paper is devoted to defining and calculating these spin - density matrices .",
    "one can choose any spin - density matrix formalism to perform the calculation .",
    "the simplest is perhaps the one in which all the spin indices are just the ordinary dirac indices .",
    "however , the drawback of this approach is that all the density matrices are @xmath12 and they do not have a clear physical interpretation . as is often the case ,",
    "the physics is much clearer in the helicity basis@xcite . throughout this paper",
    ", we shall use this formalism , and thus @xmath13 and @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ tot1 ] ) are to be interpreted as helicity indices with values @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 for short ) .    in the helicity formalism ,",
    "one first choose the helicity basis , @xmath17 for fermion and @xmath18 for antifermion .",
    "then a general polarization state for fermion ( antifermion ) can be expressed as , @xmath19 or simply in terms of the two - component spinors , @xmath20 any processes and subprocesses with fermions and/or antifermions as external particles can be calculated as a density matrix with pairs of helicity indices .",
    "each pair corresponds to one particle , with one index representing the spin state of the particle in the amplitude and the other in the conjugate amplitude .",
    "obviously , the spin - dependent probability or cross section can be obtained by contracting these indices with the two - component wave functions in eq .",
    "( [ two1 ] ) .",
    "the helicity formalism treats the polarization of each fermion ( antifermion ) independently , since the two - component wave function is expanded in basis states which are different for each particle . in particular , the spin quantization axis is the direction of the particle s momentum .",
    "this is rather convenient because one can quickly write down a two - component wave function once one knows the relative orientation between the particle s momentum and its spin vector . in fact",
    ", it will be useful for us to define a coordinate system for each particle with its momentum as the @xmath21-axis .",
    "the directions of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 axes are defined as the directions of the spin vector @xmath24 associated with the following spinors , @xmath25 this way one is assured that the @xmath22 and @xmath23 axes are defined in the same way for all particles and antiparticles .",
    "the choice of helicity basis for each particle fixes the relative orientation of the different coordinate systems . for fermions ,",
    "the two - component spin wave function can be chosen universally as , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are polar and azimuthal angles of the spin vector relative to the momentum and the @xmath29-axis .",
    "another important advantage of the helicity formalism is that an antifermion can be treated exactly like a fermion .",
    "this should be the case because the definition of fermion and antifermion is itself arbitrary due to charge conjugation symmetry .",
    "however , in ordinary calculations , some aspects of the symmetry are not obvious because antifermions are treated as holes in the negative energy fermion sea . for instance , the spinor @xmath30 is associated with antifermion creation , whereas @xmath31 is with fermion annihilation . in other words in a feynman diagram the momentum flow for antifermions is always against the fermion number flow , and the dirac algebra follows the latter flow . in the helicity formalism , if one were to follow the fermion number flow in ordering the helicity indices , one would find that all the density matrices would be expressed naturally in terms of the transpose of pauli matrices .",
    "furthermore , if one were to use the charge conjugation relation @xmath32 to define the spinor for the antifermion , then the two - component wave function would be the complex conjugate of that in eq .",
    "( [ wave1 ] ) , @xmath33 note again that this wave function is associated with the antifermion creation .",
    "all these observations point to a simple scheme for dealing with antifermion spin calculations : order the spin indices in terms of the momentum flow rather than the fermion number flow .",
    "then the spin - density matrices are all naturally expressed in terms of pauli matrices and the two - component wave functions of antifermions are exactly the same as those of fermions . the wave function in eq .",
    "( [ wave2 ] ) now appears in a transposed form and is naturally associated with an antiparticle being created .",
    "one final note : the @xmath22 and @xmath23 axes for the antiparticle are defined by the spin vector @xmath34 associated with the spinors , @xmath35 where the minus sign follows from eq .",
    "( [ wave2 ] ) .",
    "the following sections provide concrete examples for illustrating the helicity formalism in detail .",
    "our calculation begins with quark - antiquark production via photons ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath37s .",
    "here we work in the rest frame of @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "event by event , we choose the @xmath21 axis in the direction of the quark jet , so the anti - quark momentum is in the @xmath38 direction .",
    "[ the identification of the quark jet can be made through study of jet ensembles .",
    "however , in the present calculation we implicitly assume that the @xmath0 is a fragment of the quark . the possibility of @xmath39 can be included in the final result in a straightforward way , but the @xmath0 s resulting from @xmath40 will dominantly occur at low @xmath21 ( the longitudinal momentum fraction of the quark carried by @xmath0 ) and usually will not satisfy jet isolation cuts .",

    "the 4-momenta of electron and positron are @xmath44 respectively , where @xmath45 is the polar angle of the electron .    in this section , we seek an expression for the quark - antiquark production density matrix @xmath46 in the helicity basis , where the ordering of the indices follows the momentum flow of quark and antiquark , and is shown explicitly in fig .",
    "1 . while the diagonal elements of the density matrix are unique , the off - diagonal ones depend on the phase convention for the helicity basis . in this paper",

    "the anti - quark helicity states are chosen to be @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the charge conjugation matrix ( this differs from @xcite convention ) . and",

    "clearly the coordinate system for treating quark polarization is just the one we have defined . on the other hand ,",

    "there are three distinct classes of terms in the cross section .",

    "the dependence on the polar angle arises entirely from the two - jet production cross section . to isolated the @xmath186 term",

    "the second class of terms contains the products of fragmentation functions @xmath6 and @xmath3 ; they arise from parity violation in electron or quark coupling with @xmath58 . the novel spin effects appear in the third class of terms , which involves the product of the transversity distributions @xmath187 .",
    "let us discuss the physics associated with this term in some detail .",
    "the origin of the @xmath188 term is seen in the expression for the cross section into @xmath189 , eq .",
    "( [ res1 ] ) , in the term proportional to ( @xmath190 ) . to appreciate the structure of that particular form ,",
    "consider the annihilation through the pure photon channel .",
    "the intermediate state photon is produced with helicity of @xmath191 , with equal probability for unpolarized incident leptons .",
    "if the @xmath189 pair were massive quarks produced near threshold , then their spins would be aligned with the photon spin direction , the beam direction . at production angle @xmath45 near @xmath192",
    ", the term being considered must be maximum in magnitude . that requires the @xmath89 and @xmath193 spins to be preferentially parallel to one another and to align with the @xmath194 or @xmath195 beam directions .",
    "recall that the @xmath89 and @xmath193 momenta are in the @xmath196 direction and the @xmath197 axis is in the scattering plane .",
    "given the overall sign of the @xmath198 term , it is seen that the cross section favors the @xmath199 expectation value be positive .",
    "since the anti - particle s @xmath53-axis is oriented parallel to the particle s @xmath29-axis , this means that the @xmath29-components of @xmath89 and @xmath200 spin tend to be aligned .",
    "the corresponding @xmath41-components tend to be anti - aligned , since the anti - quark s @xmath201-axis is antiparallel to the quark s @xmath41-axis in our convention .",
    "if the quark spin has an azimuthal orientation specified by @xmath202 and the anti - quark , @xmath203 , then the alignment of spins just specified leads to cos(@xmath204 ) being positive , which favors the argument near @xmath205 .",
    "this result for the transverse components of the @xmath189 pair , can be visualized by having the @xmath193 spin vector reflected through the scattering plane .",
    "then the transverse spin vector of the quark tends to be parallel to the transverse spin vector of the _ reflected _",
    "@xmath193 , the quark transverse spin tends to line up with the mirror reflected anti - quark transverse spin .",
    "next suppose that the quark ( anti - quark ) spin orientation is passed on to the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) fragmentation product .",
    "the asymmetry of the @xmath0 decay into @xmath206 provides a measure of the spin orientation . as eq .",
    "( [ gary1 ] ) shows , the proton momentum tends to be aligned with the @xmath0 spin .",
    "the corresponding eq .",
    "( [ gary2 ] ) for the @xmath141 decay into an antiproton yields the opposite distribution ",
    "the antiproton momentum tends to be antiparallel to the @xmath141 spin orientation .",
    "hence , while the @xmath29-components ( @xmath41-components ) of the quark - antiquark spins tend to align ( anti - align ) , the @xmath29-components of the decay proton and antiproton momenta tend to anti - align ( align ) .",
    "this is the interpretation of the @xmath207 term in the cross section of eq .",
    "( [ fin ] ) .",
    "note that for the @xmath37 intermediate state the conclusion is opposite from the above discussion , because @xmath208 is negative .",
    "so the transverse momentum of the proton tends to be aligned with that of the reflected antiproton .",
    "this construction leads to a simple phenomenological procedure for determining the value ( for fixed @xmath21 and @xmath209 ) of the product @xmath210 . for the photon case ,",
    "the above discussion is summarized by the statement that @xmath182 and @xmath183 tend to be on the same side of the scattering plane . for the @xmath37 case",
    "the tendency is for opposite sides of the scattering plane .",
    "so it is natural to define an asymmetry ( for fixed @xmath21 and @xmath209 ) via the number of proton - antiproton pairs on the same side of the scattering plane minus the number on opposite sides of the plane .",
    "the asymmetry selects the desired term , and has a simple @xmath45 dependence , so that results from all @xmath45 can be combined .",
    "the precise expression for this asymmetry follows from eq .",
    "( [ fin ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have obtained a differential cross section for the process @xmath211 .",
    "the cross section depends on , and therefore allows us to extract , the three twist - two quark fragmentation functions to the spin-1/2 hyperon , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath4 .",
    "these fragmentation functions contain important information about the soft qcd physics in quark fragmentation .",
    "particularly interesting are the spin - dependent fragmentation functions which encode the behavior of the spin transfer .",
    "the cross section was obtained through a @xmath123 spin density formalism in the helicity basis , in which the physics is made crystal clear .",
    "the formalism is general and can be used for other similar spin processes .    the physical process that we discussed is accessible currently at lep and slac .",
    "while up and down quark jets can produce @xmath0 and @xmath1 abundantly , the polarized hyperons are mostly produced from @xmath214 jets , as we expect from the constituent quark model .",
    "the production rate for @xmath214 jets is the same as @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "the spin transfer from polarized @xmath217 to @xmath0 is expected to be large , especially in the large @xmath21 region .",
    "the weak decay of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) into a proton and charged pion can be reconstructed easily and provides an excellent polarization analyzer . to obtain @xmath218 with enhanced statistics ,",
    "an asymmetry can be defined by summing over all events with different @xmath219 and @xmath220 s in bins of @xmath21 and @xmath52 .",
