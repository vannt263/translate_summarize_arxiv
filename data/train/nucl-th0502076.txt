    "an economic description of pairing correlations in finite nuclei is provided by hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory  @xcite making use of phenomenological interactions like e.g. the finite range gogny force  @xcite or density dependent zero - range forces combined with appropriate energy cut - offs ( cf .",
    ", e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "such a description leads to values of the pairing gap which are in overall agreement with the experimental findings .",
    "note that in these calculations , the density of levels at the fermi energy @xmath22 is controlled by the so called @xmath23mass ( i.e. @xmath24 ) which , as a rule , is smaller than the bare nucleon mass ( e.g. @xmath25 in the case of the gogny force )",
    ".    on the other hand , a number of studies have shown that the superfluid properties of nuclear systems , ranging from infinite nuclear and neutron matter to finite atomic nuclei , are strongly influenced by polarization phenomena  @xcite . in these calculations",
    "one starts from a bare nucleon - nucleon potential ( argonne , bonn , paris , etc . ) adding afterwards the renormalization processes .",
    "recently , the pairing gap , the quasiparticle spectrum and the collective modes of @xmath1sn have been calculated solving the dyson - gorkov equation  @xcite , in a single - particle space characterized by @xmath26 , allowing the nucleons to interact in the @xmath27 channel through a @xmath28 argonne",
    "n - n potential taking into account the variety of renormalization processes ( self - energy , fragmentation , induced interaction and vertex corrections ) arising from the coupling of the particles with surface vibrations . while the bare n - n interaction accounts for about half of the pairing gap , overall agreement with the experimental findings is achieved by including medium polarization effects .    in the present paper we want to shed light into the physics of these results , by studying the magnitude of the different pairing ( @xmath29 ) matrix elements as well as their dependence on the energy of the single - particle states lying in the vicinity of the fermi energy in section 2 , and by discussing the calculation of the pairing gaps associated with these matrix elements in section 3 .",
    "the matrix element of the induced interaction can be written as @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the quantum numbers of the exchanged collective vibrations , @xmath34 is the associated radial formfactor ( @xmath35 is the deformation parameter associated with the @xmath36th mode of multipolarity @xmath31 , @xmath37 is the ground - state radius and @xmath38 is the average potential ) , @xmath39 is the vibrational energy of the @xmath36th mode , while @xmath40 and @xmath3 are the single - particle and fermi energies .",
    "@xmath41 is the pairing correlation energy per cooper pair , which is of the order of @xmath42 . in practice",
    "we have used @xmath41= - 2 mev .",
    "the pre - factor 2 in eq .",
    "( [ vind ] ) comes from the two possible time orderings associated with the one - phonon exchange .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_qm ] we show the value of the diagonal matrix elements @xmath43 of the induced interaction for the nucleus @xmath1sn as a function of the single - particle energy .",
    "the single - particle levels entering eq .",
    "( [ vind ] ) have been calculated making use of a standard saxon - woods potential , whose parameters are provided in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig_qm ] . in most of our calculations we use this potential and an associated effective mass @xmath44 equal to the bare mass . in the last section",
    "we shall use instead an effective mass @xmath45 , which simulates the typical outcome of a hartree - fock calculation ( with , e.g. , the gogny interaction ) . in those cases ,",
    "the woods - saxon parameters are changed in such a way that the fermi energy remains close to the experimental value ( @xmath46 @xmath47 @xcite , see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig_m07 ] ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath39 have been determined by diagonalizing a separable multipole - multipole interaction in the quasiparticle - random phase approximation ( qrpa ) adjusting the coupling constants so as to reproduce the energies and transition probabilities of the lowest - lying states of each spin and parity .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "1 are the diagonal matrix elements of the gogny interaction . here , and in the rest of the paper , we shall employ the d1 parametrization .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath9 , which display an average value equal to -0.15 mev , are peaked at the fermi energy , within an energy range of essentially 5 mev around @xmath3 .",
    "this behaviour reflects the fact that @xmath48 is controlled , through the energy denominator appearing in eq.([vind ] ) , by the energy of the low - lying collective vibrations ( @xmath49 5 mev ) . outside this energy range ,",
    "the values of @xmath48 become very small , less than 50 kev in absolute value .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath2 decrease on average smoothly in magnitude all the way from the deepest levels up to the continuum threshold , displaying a value of about -0.3 mev at @xmath3 .",
    "the induced interaction matrix elements depend on specific properties of finite nuclei , namely the single - particle quantum numbers and energies , and the energy , the zero - point amplitude and the transition density of the vibrational states .",
    "to study the global features of the bare , of the induced , and of the gogny interactions as well as to provide a more transparent form for their matrix elements , we shall present , in the rest of this section , also the matrix elements obtained using the semiclassical thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation . in fact , this approximation averages out shell effects typical of finite nuclei and provides the overall energy dependence of the matrix elements . within this context",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite where semiclassical expressions for two - body matrix elements have been presented . to obtain a smooth behaviour of the diagonal matrix elements as a function of the continuous energy variable @xmath50",
    ", we compute the fourier transform of a two - body interaction @xmath51 using plane waves of momenta @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the average of the quantal matrix elements is carried out using the normalized semiclassical density matrix , @xmath54 in the above relation the semiclassical level density @xmath55 is @xmath56 @xmath57 being the classical turning point .",
    "we assume a constant value for the effective mass @xmath44 , neglecting its possible dependence on position .",
    "the expression for the semiclassical diagonal matrix element of @xmath58 as a function of the single - particle energy , is consequently  @xcite @xmath59 for an interaction that depends only on the magnitude of the relative coordinate @xmath60 , like the gogny interaction in the s=0 , t=1 channel , one can integrate first over @xmath61 and then over the momenta @xmath62 and @xmath63 , obtaining the expression @xmath64 where @xmath65 indicates the center of mass , @xmath66 is the on - shell pairing matrix element of the interaction @xmath67 in the @xmath68 channel and in a plane wave basis , evaluated at the local momentum @xmath69 , and @xmath70 denotes the quantity @xmath71 in the next section we shall calculate the pairing gap associated with the different interactions , and therefore we shall need the matrix elements between all pairs of particles moving in time reversal . for this purpose",
    "we shall employ a formula analogous to that given in eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) , namely @xmath72 @xmath73 in this relation @xmath50 and @xmath74 indicate the energies of the single - particle states of each pair .",
    "we now turn to the case of the induced interaction , associated with the matrix elements of eq .",
    "in this case the matrix elements depend separately on @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we then integrate over the momenta first , obtaining @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the bessel function and @xmath79 . the index @xmath33 labels the different phonons of multipolarity @xmath31 ( the phonons included in the present calculation are specified at the end of this section ) .",
    "note that one can obtain numerical results from eq .",
    "( [ vsemi ] ) by avoiding the six - dimensional integration .",
    "this is achieved by performing a multipole expansion of the quantity @xmath80 which leads to @xmath81    in ref .",
    "@xcite the reliability of the tf approximation in reproducing the quantum mechanical ( qm ) matrix elements has been checked in the particular case of the pairing matrix elements of a @xmath82-interaction acting among particles moving in a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) potential .",
    "note that the tf approach implies an averaging over the quantum numbers associated with the different states belonging to the major shells and displaying an energy @xmath83 .",
    "the tf matrix elements have been compared with the averaged qm matrix elements ( taking degeneracies into account ) .",
    "overall agreement was observed ( cf . table ii of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a similar comparison for the pairing matrix elements of the gogny force in the @xmath68 channel is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig_semicl ] .",
    "it is seen that the tf approach provides a good approximation to the average quantum matrix elements",
    ". however , the qm diagonal matrix elements , in particular those associated with @xmath84-states , are systematically larger ( in absolute value ) than the non - diagonal ones .",
    "one should be aware of the fact that the semiclassical density matrix can be considered to be the analogue to the one obtained from a strutinsky smoothing .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ dos ] ) , implicitly , represents a function of about 1@xmath85 width .",
    "thus , the matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ veve ] ) contains at the quantum level cross terms corresponding to at least one major shell .",
    "taking for example the 2s-1d shell , we have to weigh the two diagonal matrix elements with the 2s and 1d wavefunctions with a factor 1 and 25 , respectively .",
    "the non - diagonal 2s-1d element obtains the weight factor 10 . performing the arithmetic average yields the crosses of fig .",
    "[ fig_semicl ] . in this way , we see that the tf expression ( [ veve ] ) reproduces very well the quantal average .",
    "the more realistic case of the gogny matrix elements in the woods - saxon potential ( including spin - orbit ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_ws ] .",
    "the general pattern is similar to that shown in the previous figure .",
    "having assessed its validity , we now employ the semiclassical approximation to compare the matrix elements of the induced interaction , the effective gogny interaction and a bare nucleon - nucleon interaction . concerning the latter , the matrix elements of bare nucleon - nucleon interactions which contain a repulsive core display a qualitatively different momentum dependence than that displayed by the gogny interaction .",
    "we shall instead consider here the @xmath0 interaction , which has been devised to reproduce the low - momentum properties of the nucleon - nucleon force , including the experimental phase shifts , without the introduction of a repulsive core @xcite .",
    "in particular , we shall employ a parametrization of @xmath0 devised to reproduce the properties of @xmath28 argonne potential .",
    "this parametrization requires a momentum cutoff @xmath86 equal to 2.1 @xmath87 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath0 in a plane wave basis have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and are reported in fig .",
    "[ figure_sedra ] .",
    "it is seen that , while @xmath2 is less attractive than @xmath0 for small momenta , it becomes more attractive for @xmath5 larger than @xmath881 @xmath87 .",
    "the semiclassical matrix elements of the gogny d1 interaction ( eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) ) and of the @xmath0 interactions calculated as a function of the single - particle energy for the nucleus @xmath1sn , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_lowk1 ] .",
    "we remark that , close to the fermi energy , the matrix elements of the gogny interaction calculated with the d1s parametrization are about 10 kev less attractive .",
    "it is seen that the general trend is the same as that obtained in infinite matter , with the difference that the matrix elements of the two interactions look somewhat more similar to one another .",
    "insight into this difference can be obtained with the help of eq.([simple ] ) .",
    "this relation is essentially an average of @xmath89 calculated at the various local momenta in the nucleus . from fig .",
    "[ figure_sedra ] we see that in the interior of the nucleus ( at larger local momenta ) @xmath2 is more attractive than @xmath0 , but on the surface it tends to be less attractive than @xmath0 .",
    "the semiclassical matrix elements of the induced interaction are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_lowk1 ] .",
    "these matrix elements are strongly peaked around the fermi energy and reproduce rather well the average of the quantal results already shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_qm ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig_ind1 ] we have separated the contributions arising from the exchange of phonons of multipolarities @xmath31=2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "we include all the phonons with energy below 30 mev in the calculation .",
    "the importance of the contributions with @xmath31=2 and 3 can be understood in terms of the high collectivity and low energy of the associated collective modes .",
    "the energies and deformation parameters of the low - lying modes are @xmath90 mev , @xmath91 mev , @xmath92 mev and @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "we also note that at the fermi energy the matrix elements of @xmath9 are rather large , of the order of those associated with the bare nucleon - nucleon potential @xmath0 ( in this connection , cf . the estimate in ref .",
    "in this section , we shall discuss the results of calculations of the pairing gap which employ the matrix elements discussed above . in the nucleus under study , namely @xmath1sn",
    ", we obtain the state - dependent pairing gaps by solving the generalized bcs equations @xcite : this means that we solve the hfb equations by treating the pairing sector self - consistently , while the mean field is described in terms of the woods - saxon potential already used in the calculation of the matrix elements . in this way",
    ", we take into account scattering processes between nucleons lying on orbits having different number of nodes / energies @xcite , associated with non - diagonal matrix elements of the type @xmath96 , with different energies @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( or @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) .",
    "this is at variance with the usual bcs method in which the pairing gap receives contributions only from scattering processes between time - reversal states .",
    "we shall refer in the following either to quantal or to semiclassical calculations ; in the latter case , this is done by solving the same equations as in the quantal case , but replacing the qm matrix elements with the tf ones , using eq .",
    "( [ offdiag ] ) and the prescription @xmath101    the positive energy states are obtained by setting the system in a spherical box .",
    "we have checked that convergence is achieved using @xmath102=12 fm and including all the states from the bottom of the potential up to the positive energy @xmath103=50 mev .    in infinite neutron matter ,",
    "the pairing gaps calculated with the interactions @xmath0 and @xmath2 are very similar up to fermi momenta of the order of 0.6 @xmath87 , becoming increasingly different from each other at higher momenta , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_deltaf ] ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite , where the d1s parametrization of the gogny interaction has been used ) .",
    "the pairing gap obtained with @xmath0 goes to zero , around saturation , as a function of @xmath104 much faster than that associated with @xmath2 ; it can also be seen that the pairing gap obtained with @xmath0 reproduces quite accurately the result found allowing particles to interact through the argonne @xmath28 bare n - n potential @xcite . in the case of @xmath1sn , the pairing gap with the @xmath28 argonne interaction and with @xmath105 ,",
    "was calculated previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , obtaining a value of about 2.2 mev close to the fermi energy .",
    "we have verified that essentially the same value is obtained with @xmath0 , in keeping with the infinite matter case ( cf .",
    "[ fig_deltaf ] ) . in the following",
    ", however , we shall adopt the value @xmath106 , which is the typical value associated with hartree - fock calculations performed with gogny or skyrme forces . in fig .",
    "[ fig_m07 ] we compare the state - dependent pairing gap obtained with the gogny force and with the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "we also compare the pairing gaps obtained inserting the semiclassical pairing matrix elements in the hfb equations .",
    "we remark that the semiclassical approach takes out the scatter from shell effects which is a desirable feature when one wishes to reveal generic trends .",
    "the gogny interaction leads to a pairing gap of 1.4 mev close to the fermi energy , in good agreement with the experimental value deduced from the odd - even mass difference .",
    "this value is about two times larger than that obtained with @xmath0 .",
    "note also that the pairing gap obtained with @xmath0 reproduces the results obtained with the bare @xmath28 interaction  @xcite .",
    "we remark that using the d1s parametrization of the gogny force , instead of d1 , one obtains a gap at the fermi energy of about 1.2 mev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_ind ] we show the state - dependent pairing gap obtained with the pairing matrix elements of @xmath107 , resulting from the sum of the matrix elements of the bare interaction @xmath0 and of the induced interaction @xmath9 .",
    "the average value of the resulting pairing gap @xmath108 at the fermi energy is about 2 mev .",
    "this value is about 25% higher than that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we solved the dyson - gorkov equation , taking properly into account all polarization effects ( induced interaction , self - energy and vertex corrections )  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that according to nuclear field theory ( nft ) @xcite , if one considers the effects of the exchange of phonons between pairs of nucleons , one has to consider at the same time processes where the phonon is absorbed by the same nucleon which has virtually excited it .",
    "such processes lead to self - energy ( @xmath109-mass and single - particle splitting ) as well as to vertex correction phenomena . of these processes and for the nucleus under discussion ( @xmath1sn ) , @xmath11mass effects @xcite are the most important . taking such effects into account is equivalent to use a residual interaction @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the quasiparticle strength @xcite at the fermi energy ( cf .",
    "appendix a ) .",
    "consequently @xmath112 .",
    "because @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath113 , that is to the square of the deformation parameters associated with the low - lying collective vibration and inversely proportional to the energy denominator @xmath114 appearing in eq.([vind ] ) , a typical error of 20% on @xmath115 and @xmath114 implies a 60% error in @xmath9 . making use of this fact and of the results of figs .",
    "[ fig_qm ] and [ fig_ind ] one obtains , as discussed in appendix b , @xmath116 mev .",
    "it is seen that the 60% error in @xmath9 has been reduced to a 10% in @xmath117 .",
    "this is because the stronger the particle - vibration coupling is , the larger @xmath118 but the smaller the amount of single - particle content of levels around @xmath119 ( and thus the smaller @xmath12 ) , and viceversa .",
    "the self consistency between collectivity of the modes , strength of the particle - vibration coupling , and quasi - particle residue at the pole , typical of nft , allows theory to make predictions which are more accurate than the basic parameters entering the calculation , as a result of a delicate process of cancellation of errors .",
    "summing up , we have found that the small difference existing between the matrix elements of the bare @xmath0 interaction and those of the gogny interaction leads to important differences between the pairing gaps associated with the two forces ( @xmath120 , for @xmath25 ) .",
    "this difference is removed and eventually overwhelmed by including the attractive contribution coming from the induced interaction @xmath9 arising from the exchange of surface vibrations , which acts only on a rather small energy range around @xmath3 .",
    "we note that the pairing gap in @xmath1sn is not much changed , including also the effect of spin fluctuations @xcite , which instead give the dominant ( repulsive ) contribution to the induced interaction in neutron matter .",
    "the 25% excess displayed by the resulting total pairing gap with respect to the experimental value is corrected by considering the corresponding quasiparticle strength at the fermi energy .",
    "an important question which remains to be addressed quantitatively is the ability @xmath121 as well as @xmath2 have to describe in detail the isotopic and nuclear structure dependences displayed by @xmath8 .",
    "this subject will be addressed in a future publication .    within this context , we note that the dependence of the pairing gaps generated by @xmath2 and by @xmath122 on temperature and rotational frequency is expected to be quite different , as @xmath2 and @xmath0 are essentially independent of these parameters , while @xmath9 is quite sensitive to them .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that a recent study in symmetric nuclear matter revealed a very strong extra attraction coming from the induced interaction @xcite .",
    "nuclear matter and finite nuclei may , however , show only qualitative similarities in this case and a quantitative link may be difficult to establish .",
    "we thank l. coraggio for providing us with the matrix elements of the @xmath0 interaction .",
