    "the meson - baryon scattering processes are an important test for effective field theories which aim at reproducing qcd at small energies , where the effective degrees of freedom are hadrons rather than quarks and gluons .",
    "the task to construct a systematic effective field theory for the meson - baryon scattering processes in the resonance region is closely linked to the fundamental question as to what is the nature of baryon resonances . here",
    "we support the conjecture @xcite that baryon resonances not belonging to the large-@xmath4 ground states are generated dynamically by coupled - channel dynamics @xcite . for a comprehensive discussion of this issue",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "this conjecture was the basis of the phenomenological model @xcite , which generated successfully non - strange s- and d - wave resonances by coupled - channel dynamics describing a large body of pion and photon scattering data . before the event of the quark - model it was already suggested by wyld @xcite and also by dalitz , wong and rajasekaran @xcite that a @xmath5-channel vector meson exchange model for the s - wave meson - baryon scattering problem has the potential to dynamically generate s - wave baryon resonances upon solving a coupled - channel schrdinger equation . in a more modern language",
    "the @xmath5-channel exchange was rediscovered in terms of the weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) interaction , the leading term of the chiral lagrangian that reproduces the first term of the vector meson exchange in an appropriate taylor expansion @xcite .",
    "the main difference of the early attempts from computations based on the chiral lagrangian is the way the coupled - channel scattering equation is regularized and renormalized .",
    "the crucial advance over the last years in this field is therefore a significant improvement of the systematics , i.e. how to implement corrections terms into coupled - channel dynamics @xcite .    in recent works @xcite , which will be reviewed here",
    ", it was shown that chiral dynamics provides a parameter - free prediction for the existence of a wealth of strange and non - strange s- and d - wave wave baryon resonances , once the crossing symmetry constraint is implemented properly .",
    "naively one may expect that chiral dynamics does not make firm predictions for d - wave resonances since the meson baryon - octet interaction in the relevant channels probes a set of counter terms presently unknown .",
    "however , this is not necessarily so .",
    "since a d - wave baryon resonance couples to s - wave meson baryon - decuplet states chiral symmetry is quite predictive for such resonances under the assumption that the latter channels are dominant .",
    "this is in full analogy to the analysis of the s - wave resonances @xcite that neglects the effect of the contribution of d - wave meson baryon - decuplet states .",
    "the empirical observation that the d - wave resonances @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 have large branching fractions ( @xmath9 ) into the inelastic @xmath10 channel , even though the elastic @xmath11 channel is favored by phase space , supports our assumption .",
    "the starting point to describe the meson - baryon scattering process is the chiral su(3 ) lagrangian ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "a systematic approximation scheme arises due to a successful scale separation justifying the chiral power counting rules @xcite .",
    "our effective field theory of the meson - baryon scattering processes is based on the assumption that the scattering amplitudes are perturbative at subthreshold energies with the expansion parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the small scale @xmath13 is to be identified with any small momentum of the system .",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking scale is @xmath14 with the parameter @xmath15 mev determined by the pion decay process .",
    "once the available energy is sufficiently high to permit elastic two - body scattering a further typical dimensionless parameter @xmath16 arises @xcite .",
    "since this ratio is uniquely linked to two - particle reducible diagrams it is sufficient to sum those diagrams keeping the perturbative expansion of all irreducible diagrams , i.e. the coupled - channel bethe - salpeter equation has to be solved .",
    "this is the basis of the @xmath17-bs(3 ) approach developed in @xcite .",

    "the terms in ( [ wt - term ] ) constitute the leading order s - wave interaction of goldstone bosons ( @xmath19 ) with the baryon - octet ( @xmath20 ) and baryon - decuplet ( @xmath21 ) states .",
    "the octet and decuplet fields , @xmath22 and @xmath21 , posses an appropriate matrix structure according to their su(3 ) tensor representation .",
    "the scattering process is described by the amplitudes that follow as solutions of the bethe - salpeter equation , @xmath23 where we suppress the coupled - channel structure for simplicity .",
    "the meson and baryon propagators , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are used in the notation of @xcite .",
    "we apply the convenient kinematics : @xmath26 where @xmath27 the initial and final meson and baryon 4-momenta .",
    "the bethe - salpeter scattering equation is recalled for the case of meson baryon - octet scattering .",
    "an analogous equation holds for meson baryon - decuplet scattering process ( see e.g. @xcite ) . referring to the detailed discussion given in @xcite we assume a systematic on - shell reduction of the bethe - salpeter interaction kernel leading to the effective interaction @xmath28 used in ( [ bs - coupled ] ) .",
    "the latter is is expanded according to chiral power counting rules .",

    "we insist on the renormalization condition , @xmath36 together with the natural choice for the subtraction points , @xmath37 as explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "the renormalization condition reflects the crucial assumption our effective field theory is based on , namely that at subthreshold energies the scattering amplitudes can be evaluated in standard chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this is achieved by supplementing ( [ bs - coupled ] ) with ( [ ren - cond],[eq : sub - choice ] ) .",
    "the subtraction points ( [ eq : sub - choice ] ) are the unique choices that protect the s - channel baryon - octet masses manifestly in the p - wave @xmath38 scattering amplitudes .",
    "the merit of the scheme @xcite lies in the property that for instance the @xmath39 and @xmath40 scattering amplitudes match at @xmath41 approximately as expected from crossing symmetry . in @xcite",
    "we suggested to glue s- and u - channel unitarized scattering amplitudes at subthreshold energies .",
    "this construction reflects our basic assumption that diagrams showing an s - channel or u - channel unitarity cut need to be summed to all orders at least at energies close to where the diagrams develop their imaginary part . by construction",
    ", a glued scattering amplitude satisfies crossing symmetry exactly at energies where the scattering process takes place . at subthreshold energies crossing symmetry",
    "is implemented approximatively only , however , to higher and higher accuracy when more chiral correction terms are considered .",
    "insisting on the renormalization condition ( [ ren - cond],[eq : sub - choice ] ) guarantees that subthreshold amplitudes match smoothly and therefore the final glued amplitudes comply with the crossing - symmetry constraint to high accuracy .",
    "the natural subtraction points ( [ eq : sub - choice ] ) can also be derived if one incorporates photon - baryon inelastic channels .",
    "then additional constraints arise .",
    "for instance the reaction @xmath42 , which is subject to a crossing symmetry constraint at threshold , may go via the intermediate states @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "the perturbative nature of subthreshold amplitudes , a crucial assumption of the @xmath17-bs(3 ) approach proposed in @xcite , is not necessarily true in phenomenological coupled - channel schemes in @xcite . using the subtraction scales as free parameters , as advocated in @xcite ,",
    "may be viewed as promoting the counter terms of chiral order @xmath45 to be unnaturally large . if the subtraction scales are chosen far away from their natural values ( [ eq : sub - choice ] )",
    "the resulting loop functions are in conflict with chiral power counting rules @xcite .",
    "though unnaturally large @xmath45 counter terms can not be excluded from first principals one should check such an assumption by studying corrections terms systematically @xcite .",
    "a detailed test of the naturalness of the @xmath45 counter terms was performed within the @xmath17-bs(3 ) scheme @xcite demonstrating good convergence in the channels studied without any need for promoting the counter terms of order @xmath45 .",
    "possible correction terms in the approach followed in @xcite have so far not been studied systematically for meson - baryon scattering . moreover , if the scheme advocated in @xcite were applied in all eleven isospin strangeness sectors with @xmath46 a total number of 26 subtraction parameters arise .",
    "this should be compared with the only ten counter terms of chiral order @xmath45 contributing to the on - shell scattering amplitude at that order @xcite . selecting only the operators that are leading in the large-@xmath4 limit of qcd out of the ten @xmath45 operators only four survive @xcite . for consistency and before applying the approach of @xcite to all isospin strangeness channels , it would be highly desirable to address the above mismatch of parameters .",
    "our scheme has the advantage that once the parameters describing subleading effects are determined in a subset of sectors one has immediate predictions for all sectors @xmath47 .",
    "a mismatch of the number of parameters is avoided altogether since the @xmath45 counter terms enter the effective interaction kernel directly .",
    "given the subtraction scales ( [ eq : sub - choice ] ) the leading order calculation is parameter free .",
    "of course chiral correction terms do lead to further so far unknown parameters which need to be adjusted to data . within the @xmath48bs(3 )",
    "approach such correction terms enter the effective interaction kernel @xmath28 rather than leading to subtraction scales different from ( [ eq : sub - choice ] ) as it is assumed in  @xcite .",
    "in particular the leading correction effects are determined by the counter terms of chiral order @xmath49 .",
    "the effect of altering the subtraction scales away from their optimal values ( [ eq : sub - choice ] ) can be compensated for by incorporating counter terms in the chiral lagrangian that carry order @xmath45 .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the s- and d - wave baryon resonance spectrum that arises in the su(3 ) limit . the latter is not defined uniquely depending on the magnitude of the current quark masses , @xmath50 .",
    "we consider two scenarios @xcite . in the light su(3 ) limit the current quark masses are chosen such that one obtains @xmath51 mev .",
    "the second case , the heavy su(3 ) limit , is characterized by @xmath52 mev . in the su(3 ) limit meson baryon - octet scattering is classified according to , @xmath53 the leading order chiral lagrangian predicts attraction in the two octet and the singlet channels but repulsion in the 27-plet and decuplet channels . as a consequence in the heavy su(3 )",
    "limit the chiral dynamics predicts two degenerate octet bound states together with a non - degenerate singlet state @xcite . in the light su(3 ) limit all states disappear . in the @xmath54 sector",
    "the weinberg - tomozawa interaction is attractive in the octet , decuplet and 27-plet channels , but repulsive in the 35-plet channel , @xmath55 therefore one may expect resonances or bound states in the former channels . indeed , in the heavy su(3 )",
    "limit we find @xmath56 bound states in this sector forming an octet and decuplet representation of the su(3 ) group .",
    "we do not find a 27-plet - bound state reflecting the weaker attraction in that channel .",
    "however , if we artificially increase the amount of attraction by about 40 @xmath57 by lowering the value of @xmath58 in the weinberg - tomozawa term , a clear bound state arises in this channel also .",
    "a contrasted result is obtained if we lower the meson masses down to the pion mass arriving at the light su(3 ) limit .",
    "then we find neither bound nor resonance octet or decuplet states . this pattern is a clear prediction of chiral coupled - channel dynamics which should be tested with unquenched qcd lattice simulations @xcite .",
