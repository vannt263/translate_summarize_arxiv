    "witten s formulation of open bosonic string field theory ( sft ) @xcite-@xcite has experienced a rebirth through new physical insights and technical advances @xcite-@xcite . its application to certain nonperturbative aspects of string theory , in particular d - branes , has prompted the development of new mathematical tools to reformulate and analyze perturbative as well as nonperturbative string physics in the context of string field theory .    over",
    "a year ago it was shown in @xcite that the star product in sft , originally defined by witten as a path integral that saws two strings into a third one , is equivalent to the moyal star product @xcite which is at the heart of the familiar formulation of noncommutative geometry douglasnekrasov",
    ". we will refer to this formulation of sft as the moyal star formulation of string field theory ( msft ) @xcite,@xcite-@xcite,@xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the moyal star in msft is defined in the phase space of _ only even string modes _",
    "@xmath1 _ _  _ _ _ for each mode independently , _ and furthermore , that the product is local at the midpoint of the string @xmath2 .",
    "the midpoint details were fully clarified in @xcite .",
    "thus , in msft a string field is denoted by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the noncommutative space formed by the direct product of moyal planes .",
    "the moyal star product @xmath5 is defined for each pair @xmath6 independently for each @xmath7 at fixed @xmath8    in the discrete basis labelled by @xmath9 a cutoff method was introduced to regulate associativity anomalies @xcite and provide a precise definition of msft with a regulator @xcite@xcite .",
    "subsequently , a moyal star related to the original one in @xcite was discussed in continuous bases @xcite-@xcite . with proper care of anomalies and regulators , the discrete and continuous bases are completely equivalent as discussed in @xcite and in the next section .",
    "so , msft may be pursued in different bases and it may be sometimes beneficial to change bases for the efficiency or clarity of a computation .",
    "so far explicit computations have been carried out mainly in the original discrete basis which provides a natural and consistent regulator that is necessary for careful computation .",
    "the msft star product is similar to , but is different than , deformation quantization @xcite of string theory , since in deformation quantization all phase space degrees of freedom enter in the moyal star , while in msft the degrees of freedom involved in the moyal star are _ half _ of all phase space of the _ excited _ modes of the open string ( also the midpoint is not part of this space ) .",
    "the advantage of msft is its structural and computational simplicity .",
    "computations in msft are based only on the use of the moyal star product .",
    "the new star provides an alternative to the oscillator tool or the conformal field theory tool as a method of computation .    to perform explicit computations , a monoid algebra ( almost a group )",
    "was introduced in @xcite@xcite as an effective tool .",
    "the structure of the monoid algebra turns out to be sufficient to evaluate the star products and traces in most computations of physical interest .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that interaction vertices in msft are in full agreement with other versions of sft , in particular the oscillator version in @xcite .",
    "furthermore new results involving interaction vertices for any number of perturbative or nonperturbative string states ( projectors that describe d - branes ) were obtained through msft for the first time .",
    "the computation of feynman graphs for interacting strings , with perturbative or nonperturbative external states , has also been developed more recently using msft techniques @xcite ] .",
    "as an aside it was shown that the propagator in msft is also in full agreement with other approaches to string theory .",
    "therefore msft , with a cutoff , reproduces the correct vertices and propagators of perturbative string theory while providing a convenient formalism for pursuing nonperturbative aspects .",
    "the progress in msft during the past year will be outlined , and some open problems will be mentioned at the end .",
    "the action of open string field theory is given by @xcite@xmath10here there are three ingredients : an associative star product @xmath11 , the trace \" tr , and the kinetic operator @xmath12 .",
    "this action is similar to the chern - simons action . in this analogy",
    "@xmath13 is similar to a 1-form which is a matrix and is a function of the string midpoint @xmath14 , @xmath12 behaves like an exterior derivative , @xmath11 is like a matrix product , and tr is like a matrix trace . just like the chern - simons theory , the action is gauge invariant under @xmath15    the specific form of @xmath12 defines the kinetic term , which corresponds to a description of a vacuum in the absence of the cubic interaction . if the cubic term is treated perturbatively , each choice of @xmath12 defines a different perturbative expansion . the perturbative vacuum around any conformal theory background is given by the standard brst operator constructed from ghosts and the virasoro operators in that background ( e.g. the flat background ) . however , one may expand the theory around any nonperturbative classical solution of the action , including solutions that correspond to d - brane backgrounds . in that case",
    "@xmath12 contains information about the d - brane solution while satisfying the desired properties , namely that it acts like an exterior derivative .",
    "the vacuum string field theory ( vsft ) proposal @xcite corresponds to the closed string tachyon vacuum , and there is strong evidence that this is represented by a @xmath12 that depends only the midpoint coordinates .",
    "there are several realizations of @xmath16tr,@xmath12 in various formalisms , including conformal field theory and oscillators @xcite , which have proven to be cumbersome to manipulate in computations , although they are perfectly correct . in msft the star @xmath11 is the standard moyal product in half of the phase space of the string ( even modes or related , see below ) and the trace is the integral over the phase space .",
    "@xmath12 maintains the same structure as other formalisms but is rewritten in terms of half the phase space , and becomes a second order differential operator in noncommutative space . with these ingredients string field theory",
    "becomes essentially field theory in noncommutative space , albeit with a kinetic term that is more involved than the usual noncommutative field theory .",
    "thus msft is a much more familiar setting which is accessible to a larger audience that has been studying noncommutative geometry , deformation or geometric quantization , and the associated field theories .",
    "techniques employed in these other fields can now be borrowed to study string field theory .",
    "there are however , fascinating new properties not seen before in noncommutative field theory , including two timelike coordinates when @xmath17 .",
    "the label @xmath18 corresponds to the usual timelike coordinate .",
    "effectively there is a second timelike coordinate @xmath19 associated with the bosonization of the @xmath20-ghosts , @xmath21the field @xmath22 behaves like a 27th dimension @xmath23 which is actually timelike @xmath24 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath25 are hermitian and also the string field @xmath26(@xmath27 ) is real under the complex conjugation operation @xmath28(@xmath29)@xmath30(@xmath31 ) , where @xmath32 represents the usual coordinates .",
    "these are possible only if @xmath33(@xmath34 ) are antihermitian , or @xmath35 with the timelike @xmath36 hermitian like the other string coordinates . in conformal field theory",
    "the operator products of @xmath37 have spacelike signature , therefore @xmath24 has timelike signature .",
    "thus , in string field theory , if the bosonized ghost is treated like the other coordinates under hermitian conjugation , the spacetime index on @xmath38 is labelled as @xmath39 with two times .",
    "the ( 25,2 ) lorentz symmetry of @xmath40 is broken because the center of mass of the ghost coordinate @xmath41 is compactified@xmath42 , and also the kinetic operator @xmath12 treats the ghosts @xmath35 differently than the other 26 dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , the moyal star among the higher modes @xmath6 , which determines the interactions , respects the ( 25,2 ) symmetry .",
    "thus the extra timelike coordinate is a fact of life in the theory even in the absence of a full ( 25,2 ) symmetry .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of two - time physics field theory @xcite which has a gauge symmetry quite similar to the one in msft .",
    "it is my approach to two - time physics field theory that led me to the concept of the moyal product in string field theory .",
    "[ ghost ] ] and the correct amount of gauge symmetry to remove related ghosts ( negative norm states caused by the timelike coordinates ) .    in vacuum string field theory @xmath12",
    "may be as simple as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 are fermionic ghosts @xcite . in the bosonized ghost approach@xmath45",
    "this midpoint @xmath46 becomes a simple differential operator @xcite@xmath47it depends only on the midpoint of the bosonized ghost @xmath48 , while @xmath49 is the ghost number operator . for fields of definite ghost number we have ghosts ,",
    "the zero mode of @xmath37 is compactified on the periodic interval 0@xmath50 so that the ghost number @xmath51 has eigenvalues @xmath52 with @xmath53[compact ] ] @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 is independent of the midpoint @xmath57 on this space it is easy to see that this @xmath12 squares to zero @xmath58 , and it has trivial cohomology - i.e. any field that satisfies @xmath59 ( @xmath60=odd ) is of the form @xmath61 ( @xmath62=even ) .",
    "therefore in this vacuum there are no open strings since no physical solutions exist to the linearized equations of motion @xmath59 . in this formalism",
    ", the physical string field in the action has ghost number -1/2 ( @xmath63 ) , i.e. @xmath64 while the star product is defined with an extra midpoint phase @xmath65 if one follows the dependence on the midpoint @xmath48 it is easy to see that @xmath48 can be completely removed from the theory and @xmath12 is then replaced by a constant when applied on the physical field .",
    "the constant can be absorbed into renormalizations of @xmath66 and @xmath67 then the classical equation of motion becomes the projector equation @xmath68 which has many nonperturbative solutions that include d - branes .",
    "solutions to the projector equation are easily obtained when @xmath11 is the moyal product in msft , and a general explicit class that includes the sliver , butterfly etc .",
    "is given in @xcite .",
    "the bosonized @xmath46 in eq.([boseq ] ) gives the simplest version of the vsft proposal .",
    "but the vsft proposal is still under investigation and it appears that the midpoint structure may receive some more clarification @xcite .",
    "when @xmath69 corresponds to the perturbative vacuum , the action in the siegel gauge simplifies to@xmath70where @xmath71 is the virasoro operator in any exact conformal theory background . in the flat background",
    "it is a sufficiently simple differential operator ( see below ) that is easily manageable in msft as shown in feynman graph computations in @xcite . in backgrounds that are closely related to flat backgrounds",
    "( such as tori , orbifolds , etc . )",
    "we expect that the formalism is also reasonably manageable .",
    "the form of eq.([perts ] ) makes it evident that msft is a noncommutative field theory of the usual kind , but in a direct product space of moyal planes in string theory refers to the center of mass timelike coordinate @xmath72 , and that in msft @xmath73 is rewritten as a derivative with respect to the _ midpoint only _",
    "@xmath74 with respect to the midpoint there are a maximum of two time derivatives in @xmath75 , as in usual field theory ( see eq.([lo ] ) ) .",
    "the timelike derivatives with respect to the higher modes @xmath76 with @xmath77 in the moyal product are not the _ time _ '' derivatives , so these do not pose a problem .",
    "therefore , msft does not suffer from multiple _ _ time _ _ `` derivatives with respect to the actual _ time _ '' parameter .",
    "one should worry about negative norm states associated with timelike directions of the higher modes , but string theory is expected to be free of negative norm states thanks to the gauge symmetry of eq.([gaugesymm ] ) combined with the on - shell brst condition that is equivalent to the equations of motion ( including interaction ) . ] .",
    "we turn to the star product . by",
    "now it has become clear that the msft star product in @xcite@xcite can be rewritten in many equivalent bases .",
    "i will describe a few of these below .",
    "recall that the open string is parametrized in terms of string modes @xmath79it will be useful to separate the modes into even @xmath80 , @xmath1 and odd @xmath81 @xmath82 the string field in position space is denoted by @xmath83 witten s star product corresponds to sawing two strings into a third one in position space - this is a complicated expression which has been difficult to manipulate in computations .",
    "the essential steps to the moyal formulation of string field theory were given in @xcite .",
    "it starts with working in the fourier basis @xmath84 @xmath85 reached by transforming the @xmath86 variable to fourier space using the kernel @xmath87 .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 absorbs units and can be mapped to 1 , if desired , with an appropriate choice of units of @xmath89 .",
    "we also rewrite the center of mass mode in terms of the midpoint @xmath90 and @xmath91 as @xmath92    starting with the basis @xmath93 we will be interested in other bases @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 that are transformed into each other . the matrices @xmath99 given by @xmath100play a special role and",
    "appear in all computations of physical quantities .",
    "these emerge from the properties of the even and odd trigonometric functions in eq.([mode - expansion ] ) .",
    "it is useful to note that they satisfy the matrix relations ( a bar means transpose)@xmath101where @xmath102 are diagonal matrices that represent the string oscillator frequencies . for an infinite number of modes the frequencies",
    "are given by @xmath103 @xmath104 but in a cutoff theory described below the diagonal entries @xmath105 can be more general functions of @xmath106 while eqs.([define ] ) continue to hold .",
    "a cutoff is needed in all formulations of sft to resolve associativity anomalies @xcite ) for large @xmath107 we get @xmath108 .",
    "this behavior causes associativity anomalies in multiple matrix products . as an illustration",
    "consider the matrix product @xmath109 if we use @xmath110 and @xmath111 which are valid at large @xmath112 we get @xmath113 versus @xmath114 such associativity anomalies are avoided by computing all matrix products at finite @xmath112 and taking the limit only at the end .",
    "note from eq.(relations ) that the factor @xmath115 appears in the denominator of @xmath116 but in the numerartor of @xmath117 such factors cancel each other in multiple products and resolve the associativity anomalies.[anom ] ] .",
    "the cutoff consists of working with a finite number of string modes @xmath118 that have oscillator frequencies @xmath119 , and introducing finite @xmath120 matrices @xmath121 as functions of the diagonal matrix @xmath122 . for @xmath123 and @xmath124 the finite matrices @xmath125 reduce to the expressions in eq.([trwv ] ) .",
    "the finite matrices @xmath125 are introduced as the solutions of eq.([define ] ) which are taken as the defining relations , since these are also satisfied by the infinite matrices .",
    "these equations were uniquely solved at finite @xmath107 in terms of arbitrary @xmath126 @xcitebkm1@xmath127although the finite matrices are given quite explicitly , most computations are done by using simple matrix relations among @xmath125 without the need for their explicit form .",
    "the following matrix relations are derived from eq.([define ] ) and therefore they apply at finite as well as infinite @xmath107 for all choices of @xmath126 as a function of @xmath60 @xmath128it is important to emphasize that in this formalism computing with arbitrary frequencies @xmath126 and finite number of modes @xmath129 is as easy as working directly in the limit .",

    "however , an alternative to this could be to shift the burden to a complicated kontsevich star product while maintaining a simpler form of @xmath305 the relation between the geometric properties of the background that determines @xmath71 and the kontsevich star product is currently poorly understood . *",
    "a study of high spin massless fields by expanding msft around tensionless strings appears to be promising . *",

    "as recently demonstrated @xcite ads@xmath307s@xmath308 supergravity can be viewed as a holographic picture of a 12-dimensional 2 t theory with @xmath309 signature .",
    "a lot more structure of this type in m - theory may be expected , and the msft and 2 t techniques seem to be natural tools to discover it and formulate it .    msft demystifies string field theory by providing a more familiar structure in the form of noncommutative geometry with more efficient computational tools .",
    "there still are technical and conceptual challenges as outlined in this lecture , but there is good reason to believe that the tools to make progress in those areas are available or can be developed .",
