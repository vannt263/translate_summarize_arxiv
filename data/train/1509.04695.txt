    "colorectal cancer ( crc ) is the third most common cancer in the united states , both in incidence and mortality rates @xcite .",
    "because this cancer is largely asymptomatic , it is important for individuals to be screened regularly .",
    "not only can screening detect colorectal cancer at earlier stages , but it can also detect pre - cancerous polyps , which can be removed @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of crc screenings led the united states preventive task force to set screening guidelines in 1996 @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on colonoscopy screenings , which are currently recommended to be performed once every ten years for average risk individuals starting at age 50 . while more expensive and risky , a colonoscopy is the most thorough form of screening as it can examine the entire colon with few false negatives or false positives , and can remove polyps and even some cancers during an examination @xcite .",
    "little is known about lifetime colonoscopy screening behavior , as it is challenging to estimate due to incomplete data .",
    "many individuals are not observed for the entirety of their eligibility , possibly censoring observations that occur before or after the study period .",
    "additionally , individuals can have zero to many screenings in a lifetime , and can have a screening immediately upon becoming due or can delay varying lengths of time .",
    "previous studies have examined rates of colorectal cancer screening in different populations , including the medicare population ( such as those found in @xcite ) . however , while these studies report that screening and adherence rates are low , the methods used do not account for screening behavior that may have occurred before or after the study observation period .",
    "in addition , these studies do not quantify the average amount of time individuals wait between screenings , or how many screenings individuals receive in a lifetime .",
    "because of this lack of information , it has been difficult for researchers to confirm optimal screening guidelines .",
    "while screening for colorectal cancer reduces cancer risk @xcite , the colonoscopy procedure itself can be risky , requires a trained specialist @xcite , and unnecessary screenings put an avoidable financial burden on the medicare system ( for example , see @xcite ) . without knowledge of lifetime screening patterns",
    ", it has been difficult to perform long - term cost - benefit analyses for outcomes in colorectal cancer . given the importance of determining lifetime colonoscopy screening behavior , we develop a multivariate survival model that allows for a proportion of subjects to never be screened , and we use our model to estimate patterns in lifetime colonoscopy screening behavior .",
    "we used the seer - medicare data set to quantify lifetime colonoscopy screening behavior .",
    "this large , public data set is a linkage between the surveillance , epidemiology and end results ( seer ) program of cancer registries and medicare claims files , and is one of the largest and most complete data sets containing colonoscopy screening information @xcite .",
    "however , subjects in the seer - medicare data set are age 65 or older , and were only observed between 1991 and 2003 .",
    "possible screenings occurred before age 65 , before 1991 , or after 2003 and were not observed , so lifetime behavior was left- and/or right - censored for many individuals .",
    "additionally , some individuals were never screened through colonoscopy , while some individuals were screened more than once in a lifetime .",
    "examples of the complexities of screening behavior can be observed in figure [ fig : seermedtraj ] .",
    "note that although the actual colonoscopy screening behaviors of hypothetical subjects @xmath0 and @xmath1 are different , the observed trajectories are the same .",
    "similarly , hypothetical subjects @xmath2 and @xmath3 have identical observed screening patterns but different true lifetime behaviors .",
    "statistical methods that can account for screening patterns that occur outside the observation window are necessary for proper estimation of lifetime screening behavior .",
    "in addition to estimation of the time and rates of colonoscopy screenings , we are also interested in the impact of health policy changes on screening behavior . medicare changed insurance coverage policy rules in 1998 to provide increased coverage for colonoscopy screenings . before 1998 ,",
    "no colonoscopy screenings were covered by medicare (  phase 0 \" ) . between 1998 and",
    "june 30 , 2001 (  phase 1 \" ) , colonoscopy screenings were covered for high - risk individuals ( e.g. those with family history of colorectal cancer ) , and starting july 1 , 2001 (  phase 2 \" ) , coverage was provided to all medicare patients , regardless of risk level .",
    "previous work has shown that an increase in medicare colonoscopy coverage led to an increase in screenings @xcite , however this has not been examined in the context of lifetime screening patterns or in the quantification of the time to being screened .",
    "understanding the impact of changes in guidelines is important to understanding barriers and patterns of screening behaviors .",
    "the model we propose will answer a number of open questions ; we will be able to quantify the number of times individuals are screened in a lifetime , and the length of time individuals wait between screenings , while quantifying how insurance policy changes affect screening behaviors . to do this ,",
    "we develop and implement a multivariate cure model that accounts for both left- and right - censoring , within - subject correlation , the estimation of multiple event times , and the average number of events per person .",
    "this model is particularly well - suited for the estimation of lifetime colorectal cancer screening , as these events are sparse over the course of an individual s lifetime and cover long periods of time .",
    "the resulting estimates are robust , despite the left - censoring , right - censoring and number of subjects who are never screened .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows : in section 3 , we discuss the multivariate survival methodology we have developed for left- and right - censored data , including the mcmc algorithm used for parameter estimation .",
    "we also discuss how covariates are incorporated into the model through the parameters . in section 4",
    ", we present results of a simulation to validate our approach for settings similar to the seer - medicare data . in section 5",
    ", we use our methodology to estimate colonoscopy screening behavior in the medicare population , using the seer - medicare data set , assuming individuals can have up to two screenings in a lifetime .",
    "section 6 contains a discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "many methods have been used to examine colonoscopy screening behavior ( such as those in @xcite ) . these studies examined screening rates using simple approaches , such as counting the number of colonoscopy screenings that occur each year , or more sophisticated approaches using poisson regression @xcite .",
    "while these statistical approaches provide basic information on colonoscopy screening trends , to quantify lifetime screening behavior , a model is needed that can account for both the left- and right - censoring inherent in the seer - medicare data set , as well as allow for some people to never be screened .",
    "below , we formulate a multivariate survival model that determines how long people wait between screenings , as well as the average number of screenings individuals get in a lifetime .",
    "cure models allow for the estimation of time to an event when a subset of the population is risk - free and will never experience the event . in the estimation of lifetime screening behavior ,",
    "the event of interest is a colonoscopy screening , and those individuals who will never be screened are part of the population that will never experience the event , and hence are  cured \" in traditional model terminology .",
    "the time to event is calculated as the time an average - risk individual waits between becoming due for a screening ( occurs at age 50 or 10 years after the previous colonoscopy screening ) and actually getting screened , which we refer to as the  lag time \" .",
    "( the lag time is depicted by solid lines in figure [ fig : seermedtraj ] . )",
    "cure models have been examined at length .",
    "initial work by boag @xcite presents the mixture model @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the survival function for individuals who will experience the event , and @xmath6 .",
    "this model has been studied extensively , and can be seen in @xcite and others , but can be complex computationally and is difficult to extend to the multivariate case .",
    "in addition to the possibility that some individuals may never be screened , some individuals may receive many screenings in a lifetime , so the possibility of multiple , dependent events ( i.e. colonoscopy screenings ) must be accounted for . to this end , there are many existing multivariate survival models that have been studied .",
    "a large body of work has been devoted to using cox models and a marginal hazards approach to investigate the effects of covariates on the hazard rate(s ) , such as that by wei , et .",
    "@xcite , liang , et .",
    "al @xcite , lin @xcite , prentice and hsu @xcite , spiekerman and lin @xcite and others .",
    "these models obtain population - averaged covariate effects , but are mainly attractive when the correlation between observations is not of interest .",
    "hougaard has done much work with a frailty term in multivariate survival and competing - risks models @xcite , however , these models do not include the possibility of a cured population .",
    "extensive work on multivariate survival models has been done by chen , ibrahim , and sinha @xcite , and perhaps matches our work most closely as some of the models allow for a cured population for right - censored data . in this work ,",
    "the authors integrate over latent variables representing the number of risks for each subject , as well as a frailty parameter ( to account for within - subject correlation ) to get a likelihood function that can accommodate multiple events as well as a proportion of subjects who are cured .",
    "however , in addition to right - censoring , we are also interested in the case of left - censoring , and require a model that incorporates this type of missingness .    we introduce a type of multivariate cure model that allows for the estimation of multiple lag times for each individual and the probability that an individual will receive zero through many lifetime screenings .",
    "correlation between lag times is accounted for with a frailty term .",
    "assume an individual has @xmath7 screenings in his or her lifetime , where @xmath7 is a random variable such that @xmath8 , with @xmath9 denoting the maximum number of lifetime screenings possible for any individual .",
    "( the time frame for colorectal cancer screening is finite , so the assumption @xmath10 is natural . )",
    "the probability an individual will have @xmath11 lifetime screenings , i.e. @xmath12 , is equal to @xmath13 , and the probability an individual will never be screened is equal to @xmath14 .",
    "if individuals are left - censored ( i.e. they enter the study after eligibility begins ) and/or right - censored ( i.e. they leave the study before eligibility ends ) , we may only observe @xmath15 of the @xmath16 screenings , where @xmath17 possibly obscuring part of the lifetime screening pattern .",
    "we estimate the lag times and probability of individuals receiving @xmath7 ( @xmath18 ) lifetime screenings via the likelihood function and the multivariate survival distribution developed by hougaard @xcite :    for individuals who receive at least one screening , let @xmath19 represent the @xmath20 lag time for the @xmath21 subject ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the lag times for each individual are correlated through a subject - specific frailty quantity but within each subject the lag times are independent .",

    "the case of @xmath27 represents the case of independent observations within each subject . for the @xmath21",
    "subject , conditional on @xmath7 and @xmath28 , the joint distribution for the lag times is then @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the cumulative hazard of the @xmath20 lag time .",
    "for all individuals , the multivariate survival distribution , given @xmath7 , then becomes @xmath31    using this multivariate survival function , we can calculate the probability of a colonoscopy screening occurring before , at , or after certain time points .",
    "for example , the probability of a colonoscopy screening occurring at time @xmath32 is calculated as @xmath33 and the probability of observing all @xmath7 screenings can be calculated as @xmath34 these calculations are akin to finding the cdf @xmath35 in the univariate case . in our notation , we use @xmath36 to represent @xmath37 .",
    "while this definition does not mathematically exist for continuous functions , in the multivariate case it is a notational method for expressing an observed colonoscopy screening at time @xmath38 .",
    "because the observed screening colonoscopies are sparse , we use markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampling for parameter estimation . the posterior distribution for each parameter",
    "is calculated using the likelihood function , which is formulated below",
    ".    denote the observed data for individual @xmath39 by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the left- and right - censoring times ( with @xmath41 = 0 if an individual is not left - censored , and @xmath42 equal to the end of the observation period if the individual is not right - censored ) , and @xmath43 denoting the @xmath44 observed screening times , with @xmath45 .",
    "the case of @xmath44 equal to zero denotes that no colonoscopy screenings were observed in the study period .",
    "using the multivariate survival distribution in equation ( [ eqn : survfxn ] ) , we can then write a complete data likelihood function as follows : @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the parameter vector for the survival distribution for @xmath48 lag times , and @xmath49 is an indicator variable that equals one if subject @xmath39 gets @xmath50 colonoscopies in a lifetime ( with @xmath51 ) .",

    "an example of the calculation of these probabilities is shown in sections [ sec : univarex ] and [ sec : examplesubj ] .",
    "for the case of no observed screenings ( i.e. @xmath53 ) , the probability of zero screenings , @xmath54 , is not defined and the only likelihood contribution in this instance is @xmath55 .    for subjects who are left- and/or right - censored and who do not have @xmath9 observed screenings , some or all of @xmath56 may be unobserved . for the unobserved @xmath57 ,",

    "in the univariate instance , the likelihood function in ( [ eqn : multlik ] ) can be simplified to : @xmath59 in the univariate model , subject @xmath39 who has an observed screening at time @xmath60 contributes the probability @xmath61 to the likelihood function ( as @xmath62 is known and equal to 1 ) .",
    "conversely , subjects who have no observed screenings and who are not left- or right - censored contribute @xmath63 to the likelihood function , with a known @xmath64 .",

    "the value of @xmath67 is unknown and is updated at each iteration of the gibbs sampler with its expected value @xmath68 this expectation is a number between 0 and 1 , and therefore a weight is assigned to the probability subject @xmath39 was screened once or never screened based on when subject @xmath39 entered the study .",
    "similar calculations can be made for right - censored or left- and right - censored subjects .",
    "note that in the univariate likelihood , the within - subject correlation parameter @xmath24 is not necessary , as each subject only has one screening .",

    "a screening also occurred before observation of the individual began , and so the subject was screened twice in his or her lifetime .",

    "these types of analyses will become more prevalent as time progresses , particularly with major changes in health care coverage due to the affordable care act .",
    "accurate assessment of patterns of lifetime preventive medical care will become more necessary as government - funded health care becomes more prevalent , and this information is required to determine the effectiveness of different medical procedures .",
