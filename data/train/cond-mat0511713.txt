    "the spreading of a liquid droplet on a surface proceeds as the droplet balances the interfacial tensions between the solid , liquid , and vapor phases . on a homogenous substrate , completely wetting droplets ( i.e. where the equilibrium contact angle @xmath4 ) often form a monolayer film or precursor foot on the surface that spreads ahead of the main droplet .",

    "this foot grows diffusively with an effective diffusion constant @xmath5 that depends on the square root of the initial radius @xmath6 of the droplet @xcite . while much has been revealed about the kinetics of droplets spreading on homogenous surfaces , spreading on chemically patterned surfaces",
    "is much less understood .",
    "in particular the influence of the pattern feature size on the spreading rate of both the precursor foot and main droplet is unknown .    with the advent of modern lithography techniques , it is now possible to chemically pattern a substrate with lyophobic and lyophilic surface domains on the nano to micron scale @xcite .",
    "these chemically structured surfaces can be useful in controlling the wetting of liquid droplets .",
    "depending on the size of the pattern and the contact angle in the two domains , wetting transitions can occur in which the liquid droplet can change its shape or morphology @xcite .",

    "for the main droplet to spread ( bulk spreading ) , the gain in interface energy must exceed the cost of increasing the surface area of the droplet .",

    ", material is completely removed from non - wetting regions . given periodicity in the @xmath28 direction",
    ", this demonstrates a case where an intial line of liquid ( in @xmath28 ) transforms into a series of parallel liquid strips ( in @xmath71 ) with separation distance in @xmath28 equal to @xmath30 . for @xmath27 , evidence of @xmath7 dependence",
    "is observed in that bulk spreading does not occur on the wetting region . a precursor film or foot",
    "is observed to spread ahead of the main droplet on the lyophilic strip in both systems .",
    "thus , even when the main droplet does not spread , a precursor foot may spread on the wetting region of the substrate . for all cases where",
    "a foot was observed to spread , the contact radius follows @xmath72 where @xmath5 is the effective diffusion coefficient . for @xmath8 and @xmath69 ( fig .  1 ) , the effective diffusion constant @xmath5 of the precursor foot is essentially equal to that for the pure wetting case @xmath57 .",
    "spreading of the precursor foot for @xmath27 causes depletion of material on the wetting region .",
    "furthermore , bulk material is unable to move quickly enough from the non - wetting region to the wetting region , resulting in the formation of a saddle shape at the center of the droplet . at late times , the precursor film spreads by polymer moving perpendicularly from the non - wetting to the wetting region , then continuing along the wetting region . in this case",
    "@xmath5 is @xmath73 of that for @xmath57 .",
    "although we do not access such time scales in our simulations , we expect that material will completely wick away from the non - wetting region as the precursor film continues to spread .",
    "figure 2 presents snapshots of @xmath8 droplets at late time for varying @xmath2 .",
    "the snapshots are shown at different times chosen so that the size of the precursor foot , when the foot spreads ahead of the droplet , is approximately the same size in each snapshot . in the weak wetting case ( fig .  2 , left panels ) , the main droplet increases in size only slightly before saturating for @xmath74 as shown in fig .  3 .",
    "for @xmath75 , the bulk droplet saturates at a radius @xmath76 in both the wetting and non - wetting regimes . as @xmath2 increases , the radius of the droplet in the non - wetting region decreases while the radius of the droplet in the wetting regime increases slightly . for @xmath77 , the main droplet spreads .",
    "similar to the behavior seen in fig .  1 for @xmath69 , the @xmath78 system in fig .",
    "2d ( left ) shows that the cross - section of material in the non - wetting region shrinks as the bulk droplet in the wetting region continually spreads . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the radius of the droplet in the wetting regime continues to grow at late time as shown in fig .",
    "3 . between @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    "the gain in surface energy exceeds the cost of increasing the surface area and material is able to be drawn continually from the non - wetting region to the wetting region .",
    "figure 2 ( right ) presents @xmath8 results for the strong wetting case .",
    "compared to the weak wetting case where spreading of a precursor foot was nearly absent for @xmath75 , fig .",
    "2a ( right ) clearly shows precursor spreading .",
    "a separate simulation of the strong wetting system with @xmath81 showed a precursor foot spreads even for this very small feature size .",
    "it is also apparent , especially for smaller @xmath2 , that the stronger interaction in the wetting region causes more spreading in the non - wetting region .",
    "the @xmath78 case for strong wetting is not shown in fig .  2 ; however , similar to the weak wetting case , the minimum width on which the bulk droplet spreads is between @xmath82 and @xmath80 .",
    "this indicates that the bulk wetting transition is related more to @xmath2 than to the strength of interaction in the wetting region @xmath83 . for reference ,",

    "the droplet spreads at early time to a radius @xmath85 before reaching its equilibrium size .",
    "this final size is comparable to what is observed for a homogenous surface with a mean surface interaction strength , @xmath86 . for @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "4b ) and @xmath52 ( fig .  1 )",
    ", the bulk radii in the wetting region saturate at lower values , @xmath87 .",
    "these data demonstrate that , for sufficiently small feature size , a mean interaction description is fairly accurate but becomes less so for increasing feature size .",
    "for @xmath88 a precursor foot spreads ahead of the droplet while for @xmath89 no foot is observed .",
    "the width @xmath2 above which the main droplet spreads on the lyophilic strip is larger than we can access with present computational resources . for comparison purposes , fig .",
    "4c presents data for @xmath57 and it is obvious that the main droplet spreads for this limit of pattern size",
    ".    the contact radius of the precursor foot increases as @xmath72 for all cases studied . the effective diffusion constant @xmath5 normalized by its value for the homogeneous wetting case is shown in fig .",
    "a result observed in all cases is that @xmath5 increases monotonically with @xmath2 . of note",
    "is an apparent cross - over in observed behavior with decreasing @xmath2 for the @xmath8 strong and weak wetting systems .",
    "data imply that , at large pattern width , foot transport for the stronger wetting system is more affected by the presence of a lyophobic region than it is for the weaker wetting system .",
    "we hypothesize that this results from the very aggressive rate of transport for the foot on the stronger wetting substrate .",
    "the system must supply material to the foot from the bulk of the droplet .",
    "the rate of foot advancement is large enough in the strong wetting case that it becomes limited by transport of material from the non - wetting region to the wetting region , and on to the foot .",
    "this is only true for large pattern width @xmath90 where the foot is comprised of a more significant amount of polymer material .",
    "note that foot transport along the lyophilic strip is observed for @xmath91 in the strong wetting system whereas it is not for the weaker interaction . in our previous work",
    "@xcite studying wetting on homogeneous substrates , we found that @xmath5 increased with the size of the initial droplet as @xmath92 .",
    "while we have not varied the size of the initial droplet in this study , we expect a similar dependence of @xmath5 on the initial size of the droplet .",
    "chemically patterning a surface offers a unique opportunity to control the spreading of liquid nanodroplets . here we have presented simulation results which demonstrate the interplay between the pattern width @xmath2 , the length of the polymer chain @xmath7 , and the interaction strength of the lyophilic strips in determining spreading behavior .",
    "we find that there exists a minimum @xmath2 , which is a function of @xmath7 , below which spreading of the main droplet does not occur .",
    "for @xmath8 , a bulk spreading transition with increasing @xmath2 was observed , while for @xmath27 , the transition occurs for @xmath2 larger than is presently accessible . in a number of cases ,",
    "a precursor foot is observed to spread even when the main droplet does not spread .",
    "the observed effective diffusion constant of this precursor foot decreases monotonically with @xmath2 .",
