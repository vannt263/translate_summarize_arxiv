    "coronal holes @xcite , are regions with a significantly reduced emissivity in lines corresponding to coronal temperatures .",
    "usually coronal holes are divided into two classes . during solar activity",
    "minimum large polar coronal holes exist with opposite magnetic polarity in the northern and southern hemisphere . around solar activity maximum smaller isolated coronal holes",
    "are present at different latitudes , even close to the equator . however , the main property of coronal holes , the reduction in brightness of coronal radiation is common to both types . for the rest of the paper we distinguish between quiet sun regions without coronal holes ( and",
    "call them simply _ quiet sun regions qs _ ) and quiet sun regions inside coronal holes ( which we call _ coronal holes ch _ ) .",
    "an intriguing observation is that the emission from chromospheric and transition region lines formed at temperatures below @xmath0 is not significantly reduced in coronal holes @xcite with the exception of he lines , whose formation is strongly affected by coronal radiation .",
    "here we use a simple statistical analysis of the magnetic structure to see if a cause for this behaviour can be found , viz . that coronal holes can easily be identified in radiation alone at @xmath1 , but are not seen below @xmath0 .",
    "coronal holes are also visible in absorption lines .",
    "the @xmath2 absorption line in he i is very useful for the identification of coronal holes , because it has a greatly reduced absorption there @xcite and",
    "this line has the additional advantage that it can be observed from the ground . the coronal maps used in this paper ( see figs . [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) have been created at nso / kitt peak from these he i observations @xcite .    the key quantity for the understanding of coronal holes is the magnetic field .",
    "according to current understanding coronal holes differ from the normal quiet sun mainly through the structure of the magnetic field , with the field lines being mainly closed in the normal quiet sun and open above coronal holes ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "hot gas is trapped in closed loops , but is able to escape along the open field lines .",
    "the trapped gas radiates , causing the normal quiet sun to be brighter .",
    "although this basic difference in magnetic structure can qualitatively explain the decreased coronal brightness in coronal holes , it begs the question why transition region brightness is not different as well .",
    "one possibility is that the chromospheric and transition region are located near the footpoints of the magnetic field lines and their properties are independent of the properties of the overlying corona .",
    "one argument against this idea come from the fact that in such a model the transition region is heated by downward conduction of heat from the corona .",
    "if there is significantly less coronal gas , as in a coronal hole it is surprising that the transition region is not affected . another problem with such models",
    "was pointed out by , e.g. , .",
    "the emission measure predicted by models such as that of @xcite falls far short of the observations at lower temperatures .",
    "proposed that short , cool loops are common in the quiet sun .",
    "they harbour a significant fraction of the gas at lower transition region temperatures .",
    "evidence for such loops has been found by @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the temperature of a loop depends on its length @xmath3 ; @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite ( @xcite ) short loops are expected to be cool , while long loops are expected to be hot .",
    "thus , one way of explaining the decreased coronal emission together with the unaffected transition region emission in coronal holes is by having a greatly decreased number of long loops , but an almost equal number of short loops relative to the normal quiet sun .",
    "here we test this hypothesis .",
    "the magnetic field strength in the photosphere beneath coronal holes has been measured by several authors , ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic flux in coronal holes clearly shows a dominant polarity .",
    "this is consistent with coronal holes being the source region of the fast solar wind flowing on open magnetic field lines . found an average magnetic field strength in coronal holes of 3 to 36 g near the solar activity maximum and 1 to 7 g close to the minimum .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) found a range from about 4 to 30 g , where polar coronal holes are more close to the lower and solar maximum coronal holes more close to the higher limit of this range .",
    "the magnetic field is , however , not exclusively unipolar in coronal holes and consequently coronal holes should contain also locally closed coronal loops besides the open flux @xcite .",
    "the presence of both magnetic polarities inside the coronal hole leads to the formation of closed magnetic loops .",
    "here we compare features of these closed loops in coronal holes with quiet sun loops by extrapolating the magnetic field starting from photospheric magnetograms .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the method for computing the magnetic field from photospheric magnetograms . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we compare the average height and length of magnetic loops for several coronal holes and quiet sun regions .",
    "the distribution functions of loop length and heights are investigated in section [ sec4 ] , while in section [ sec5 ] we compute loop temperatures with the help of scaling laws . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we discuss which magnetic features are responsible for coronal holes and finally we draw conclusions and give an outlook for future work in section [ sec7 ] .",
    "image ( bottom panel ) for 16.4.2001 at 02:30h , with boundaries of coronal holes overlaid . also marked is an analysed quiet sun region .",
    "the disc center corresponds to a carrington longitude of @xmath4.,width=415 ]     in order to allow individual loops to be distinguished . in the actual calculations a lower threshold of @xmath5",
    "the coronal hole is outlined in white .",
    "bottom panel : eit @xmath6 image of the same region .",
    "both images show the number of pixels on the x and y axis .",
    "please note the different pixel size of mdi ( @xmath7 ) and eit ( @xmath8).,width=529 ]    direct measurements of the magnetic field in the chromosphere and corona are mainly restricted to large active regions ( e.g. @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) , although a few measurements of the magnetic field in the quiet corona are available ( e.g. @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "this kind of data is only available for a few individual cases and usually one has to calculate the coronal magnetic field by means of an extrapolation from photospheric field measurements .",
    "the extrapolation method requires some assumption regarding electric currents in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the simplest approach is to compute current free or potential magnetic fields ( e.g. @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "potential fields can be reconstructed from the line of sight photospheric magnetic field alone .",
    "the corresponding photospheric magnetic field measurements are available e.g. from the soho / mdi line - of - sight magnetograph @xcite .",
    "force free and non - force - free magnetic field models are mathematically more difficult and need additional observational data , e.g. photospheric vector magnetic fields , optical observation of coronal plasma structures or even , additionally , the tomographicly reconstructed density structure for non - force - free configurations . for low lying loops in the quiet sun investigated in this work we concentrate on potential fields .",
    "coronal currents have a significant effect on the structure of long ( say , some @xmath9 long ) loops in active regions , but for the very short ( some @xmath10 or less ) quiet sun loops investigated here their influence can be neglected .",
    "we use a greens function method to compute the potential magnetic field in the solar atmosphere ( see @xcite @xcite , and appendix [ appendixb ] for details . )",
    "we investigated @xmath11 coronal hole and @xmath12 quiet sun regions during carrington rotation 1975 ( 09.4.-06.05.2001 ) .",
    "this period was employed because 56 consecutive 1-min magnetograms are available every day , from which 56 min averages are constructed , after compensating for solar ( differential ) rotation ( see @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic field data were taken from full disc mdi magnetograms when the coronal hole was closest to the central meridian ( see table [ tablea ] in appendix [ appendixb ] ) .",
    "as an example , we show the potential magnetic field lines for coronal hole region 7 and the surrounding area in figure [ fig3 ] , top panel .",
    "the image displays only the closed loops with a lower limit of the magnetic field strength @xmath13 .",
    "open field lines are not shown .",
    "outside the coronal hole ( thick white line ) the loop density is significantly higher and the loops are also longer than in the hole .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] shows the same region in the eit fe xii @xmath6 line . in the coronal hole both the emissivity in eit as well as the number and length of coronal loops",
    "are significantly reduced , although in the rightmost and bottom left edges extended bright structures are found within the ch boundary determined from 1083 he i observations .",
    "a crucial step is how to draw conclusions about the properties of coronal loops from magnetic field lines . due to the high conductivity",
    "the coronal plasma is frozen into the magnetic field .",
    "consequently the emitting plasma structures also outline the magnetic field lines .",
    "the gradients of e.g. the plasma pressure and temperature perpendicular to the magnetic field are much higher than along the magnetic field . within the statistical study it is assumed that these properties are constant along a given field line and only changes from one bundle of field lines to the next .",
    "this assumption seems to be not so bad and is consistent with cds observations regarding the thermal structure of hot coronal loops @xcite .",
    "theoretically the number of magnetic field lines in the corona ( and even the number of field lines in one observed plasma loop ) is infinite . to undertake statistical studies regarding the length and height of coronal loops",
    "we make the following assumptions .",
    "each magnetic field line starts at the center of a mdi pixel .",
    "we assume that this field line is representative for all magnetic field lines starting within the area of the corresponding mdi pixel on the photosphere .",
    "each such representative closed field line is assumed to also represent a magnetic loop .",
    "consequently the number of magnetic loops is determined by the fraction of mdi - pixels that correspond to closed field lines .",
    "now , it can be argued that this is an arbitrary measure of a loop .",
    "this is true , but given that from an extrapolation of the magnetic field alone no conclusions can be drawn regarding the distribution of the coronal plasma transverse to the field lines , this is a reasonable assumption .",
    "an mdi pixel is the smallest spatial scale which is accessible to us for the extrapolation and the assumption that each pixel supports a separate loop is driven by the small - scale structure seen by trace and the nixt instrument ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "although individual plasma loops may well be formed from field lines gathered from different sized areas on the solar surface , our approach should in a statistic sense provide the correct distribution of loop lengths , heights , etc . a bias could be introduced into the comparison between quiet sun and coronal hole only if on average loops in one of these regions are thicker than in the other , for which we have found no evidence in the literature .",
    ".table of coronal holes ( ch ) and quiet sun regions ( qs ) .",
    "the first column identifies the region , the second column shows the spatially averaged net magnetic field @xmath14 in @xmath15 , the third column the relative flux balance @xmath16 , the fourth column the area of the analysed feature , the fifth column the average height @xmath17 ( in mm ) of closed loops , the sixth column the average length @xmath18 of closed loops ( in mm ) , the second last column the number @xmath19 of closed loops and the last column the density of loops . ch1 * and qs3 * are not included in the further analysis .",
    "unsigned values have been used when forming the average ( excluding ch1 and qs3 ) . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      we use the line of sight magnetic field observed with soho / mdi and reconstruct the coronal magnetic field as a potential field with the help of a greens function method @xcite .",
    "the potential and magnetic field are presented as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the scalar potential , @xmath22 the line of sight photospheric magnetic field , @xmath23 the bottom boundary ( photosphere ) of the computational box , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the 3d magnetic field .",
    "we use mdi - data as input for our potential magnetic field code .",
    "the noise - level of the original mdi - data has been reduced by forming from 56 consecutive 1-min magnetograms , from which 56 min averages are constructed , after compensating for solar ( differential ) rotation ( see ) . to avoid the influence of the remaining noise in the magnetic field data , values of @xmath27",
    "are set to zero , as well as isolated data points ( data points with @xmath28 but with no neighbour points with the same polarity ) .",
    "the resolution of one mdi - pixel is approximately @xmath29 mm .",
    "we compute the potential magnetic field in rectangular boxes .",
    "the magnetic field lines are calculated with a fourth order runge - kutta field line tracer with step size control .",
    "the field line tracer interpolates the magnetic field between pixels with a trilinear interpolation routine .",
    "the pixel size in our computational box corresponds to one mdi pixel .",
    "we start the field line integration on the photosphere and integrated the magnetic field line until it reaches again the photosphere ( closed field lines , loops ) or the upper boundary of the computational box .",
    "these field lines are interpreted as open field lines .",
    "this interpretation seems to be quite well justified as the fraction of open flux computed with help of the so defined open field lines and the unbalanced magnetic flux on the photosphere coincide quite well ( see figure [ fraction_open ] .",
