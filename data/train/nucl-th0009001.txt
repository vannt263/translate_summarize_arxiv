    "qcd is nowadays the main theoretical framework for understanding hadronic processes , but its non - abelian character makes low energy calculations unfeasible . the usual strategy for overcoming this difficulty consists in working with effective theories , constructed in such a way as to include , as much as possible , the main features of qcd . as in nuclear physics",
    "most processes involve only the quarks @xmath1 and @xmath2 , one requires these theories to be poincar invariant and to possess approximate @xmath3 chiral symmetry .",
    "the breaking of the latter , due to the quark masses , is parametrized by the small pion mass @xmath4 at the effective level .    in the last twenty years",
    ", effective theories incorporating chiral symmetry have been successfully applied to hadronic interactions , including or not electro - weak probes . as far as the hadronic sector is concerned it",
    "is useful to distinguish two classes of processes , involving only mesons or both mesons and baryons . in the case of purely pionic systems , effective lagrangians",
    "are treated relativistically and yield well defined power counting procedures , in both pion mass and momenta @xcite .",
    "this gives meaning to the idea of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "when nucleons are present , things become more complicated @xcite and calculations were performed in the simplified framework of the so called heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) , in which nucleons are treated non - relativistically @xcite .",
    "only recently a well defined power counting scheme was proposed for the relativistic approach @xcite .    in the case of two - nucleon systems , interactions involve processes with a marked spatial hierarchy , whose dynamical complexity increases rapidly when one moves inward . in the best semi - phenomenological potentials existing at present , that can reproduce low - energy observables accurately ,",
    "the interaction is determined by the undisputed one pion exchange , supplemented by a theoretical two - pion exchange potential ( tpep ) and parametrized at short distances @xcite .",
    "the tpep is the locus of chiral symmetry in this problem , since it is closely related to the pion - nucleon ( @xmath5n ) amplitude @xcite .",
    "after the works of weinberg in the early nineties restating the role of chiral symmetry in nuclear interactions @xcite , the interest in applications was renewed and several authors have tackled the problem of constructing the tpep . initially , non - linear lagrangians containing only pions and nucleons were employed @xcite .",
    "however , these lagrangians do not suffice to describe experimental @xmath6 data @xcite and the corresponding potential misses even the scalar - isoscalar medium range nn attraction . in a later stage ,",
    "other degrees of freedom were introduced , coherence with @xmath6 information was restored and descriptions compatible with asymptotic nn scattering data were produced @xcite .",
    "it is possible to distinguish two partially overlapping theoretical frameworks in these chiral calculations .",
    "one of them , adopted in refs.@xcite and @xcite , is based on hbchpt . in this theory",
    ", a rule exists for counting powers of the typical three - momenta exchanged between nucleons , assumed to be of the order of the pion mass .",
    "this allows the construction of non - relativistic effective lagrangians , that include unknown couterterms and are used to derive amplitudes in which contributions from loops and these counterterms add up coherently .",
    "a rather puzzling aspect of these counting schemes , in the case of nn interactions , is that they predict a leading contribution in the @xmath7 expansion with the following spin - isospin structure @xcite : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the usual isospin , spin and tensor operators .",
    "this means that , in hbchpt , the scalar - isoscalar central potential , which is by far the most important phenomenological component of the tpep , corresponds to just a subleading effect .",
    "the other approach to the tpep is typically relativistic @xcite and emphasis is given to the tail of the interaction , which is determined by the well known @xmath5n amplitude .",
    "no attention is paid to counterterms in the effective lagrangian , that correspond to zero - range interactions and represent processes such as multimeson or quark exchanges .",
    "tail and conterterm contributions do not overlap in space and hence can be treated separately in nn potentials .    for systems containing just a single nucleon ,",
    "relativistic and hbchpt calculations were compared and found to be consistent , provided the dimensional regularization scale is set equal to the nucleon mass @xcite . in this work",
    "we repeat this kind of comparison , for the leading contribution to the two - pion exchange @xmath0 potential , and show that relativistic and hbchpt predictions fail to agree by 30% . the reason for this important discrepancy",
    "may be traced back to the fact that the intermediate @xmath6 amplitude can not be represented by a series around the point that determines the potential at large distances , as shown by becher and leutwyler @xcite .",
    "the construction of the tpep was discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and here we just sketch the main steps . the potential is based on the on - shell nn scattering amplitude containing two intermediate pions , from which one subtracts the iterated opep , in order to avoid double counting .",
    "the isoscalar component , represented by @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13^{(1)}\\;[t^+]^{(2 ) } }   { [ k^2-\\mu^2]\\;[k^{\\prime\\,2}-\\mu^2]}-(opep)^2 \\ ; , \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the isospin symmetric @xmath6 scattering amplitude for pions with momenta @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the factor @xmath18 accounts for the symmetry under the exchange of the intermediate pions @xcite .",
    "in the sequence we represent initial and final nucleon momenta by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , their mass by @xmath21 and also use the variables @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "in general , the amplitude @xmath14 can depend on four independent variables , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "as the exchanged pions are off shell , one should , in principle , keep @xmath28 and @xmath29 unconstrained everywhere . however , when these factors appear in the numerator of amplitudes , we may write @xmath30 or @xmath31 and use the terms within parentheses to cancel pion propagators in eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "this kind of cancellation is associated with short range terms , which do not contribute to the asymptotic potential .",
    "therefore , whenever possible , we neglect them and replace @xmath28 and @xmath29 by @xmath32 in the numerators of our expressions . concerning the variables @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the conditions of integration in eq.([1 ] ) are such that the main contributions come from the unphysical region @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the vicinity of the point @xmath35 determines the potential at very large distances .    in order to understand the structure of the tpep , it is convenient to isolate in @xmath14 a term @xmath36 , involving only chiral pion - nucleon interactions at tree level and written as @xmath37 \\not\\!q \\right\\ } u   \\ ; ,   \\label{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the @xmath6 coupling constant .",
    "the remainder is represented by @xmath39 and encompasses other degrees of freedom , either in the form of low energy constants or by means of specific models , that may include the @xmath40 and other states .",
    "one writes symbolically @xmath41=[t_n^+ ] + [ t_r^+]$ ] for each nucleon and the potential is then proportional to @xmath41^{(1)}[t^+]^{(2)}=[t_n^+]^{(1)}[t_n^+]^{(2 ) } + \\ { [ t_n^+]^{(1)}[t_r^+]^{(2 ) } + [ t_r^+]^{(1)}[t_n^+]^{(2)}\\ } + [ t_r^+]^{(1)}[t_r^+]^{(2)}$ ] .",
    "this product involves box , crossed box , triangle and bubble diagrams , that should be taken into account in a complete calculation . as pointed out by gross @xcite long ago , the @xmath42^{(1)}[t_n^+]^{(2)}$ ] contribution is very small , due to chiral cancellations .",
    "the detailed numerical study of this structure performed in ref.@xcite has confirmed this conclusion and shown that the crossed tem , within curly brackets , is largely dominant .",
    "it is due to a @xmath39 which may be expressed as @xmath43 where the @xmath44 are subthreshold coefficients @xcite . in this multipolar expansion",
    ", @xmath45 represents the fact that a nucleon can be deformed when interacting with pions and is associated with the so called axial polarizability parameter , given by @xmath46 .",
    "this allows the asymptotic central potential to be written as @xmath47^{(1 ) } \\;\\left[\\frac{\\sigma_n(t)}{\\mu^2}\\;\\bar{u}\\;u\\right]^{(2)}+ \\left(1 \\leftrightarrow 2\\right)\\ ; , \\label{4}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the nucleon contribution to the scalar form factor.$ ] , which tends to the present one for very long distances . ]",
    "quite generally , this form factor is defined in terms of the symmetry breaking lagrangian @xmath49 as @xmath50 . as discussed by gasser , sainio and varc @xcite , @xmath48",

    "typical discrepancies are of the order of 20% , indicating that the very simple mechanism described in the previous section is indeed responsible for the leading contribution to the central potential .",
    "the existing gap has the order of magnitude expected from chiral corrections .",
    "it is worth pointing that , in the case of @xmath0 interactions , these corrections would affect not only the scalar form factor , but also require the evaluation of other amplitudes . in particular , in the case of the delta contributions , one has also to include box and crossed box diagrams .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of this problem will therefore be postponed .",
    "we begin by considering first order corrections to the leading result for @xmath135 , which come from two different sources .",
    "one of them corresponds to the terms neglected when passing from eq.([27 ] ) to eq.([30 ] ) , whereas the other one is implemented by subthreshold coefficients , representing the remainder @xmath159 discussed in the previous section .",
    "thus , the scalar form factor , including both leading and first order corrections , is given by @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the result of ref.@xcite , given by eq.([29 ] ) and @xmath162 is written in terms of the subthreshold coefficients @xmath163 as@xcite @xmath164 \\right\\}\\ ; \\hat{f}_{cc } ( \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } ) \\ ; , \\label{36}\\ ] ] with @xmath165    the main contributions to the coefficients entering this result come from the @xmath82-term and the @xmath40 and one may also write @xmath166 the term @xmath167 is given by the diagram of fig.[fig.1]b . using the results of ref.@xcite",
    "one finds , after neglecting terms @xmath168 @xmath169 where @xmath170 is obtained from the @xmath171 of eq.([30 ] ) by replacing @xmath172 with @xmath173\\ ; \\lambda^2 \\;. \\label{40}\\ ] ]     eq.([36 ] - continuous line ) , @xmath167 eq.([39 ] - dashed line ) and @xmath174 eq.([38 ] - dotted line ) by the leading chiral contribution @xmath175 eqs.([30]-[32 ] ) and ( [ 23]).,width=566 ]    as the function @xmath176 determines the effective mass of the two - pion system exchanged between the nucleon and the scalar source , this result indicates that @xmath167 has shorter range than @xmath161 . in fig.[fig.7 ] , we display the ratios of @xmath162 , @xmath167 and @xmath174 by the leading chiral contribution @xmath175 and one notes that these corrections remain quite visible at relatively large distances .",
    "the fourier transform of the scalar form factor corresponds to a mass density , that surrounds the nucleon and is due , in part , to the pion cloud .",
    "as the density of the quark condensate is negative , the sign of the scalar density indicates that the pions , as goldstone bosons , destroy the condensate in order to exist . in this picture",
    ", the energy density of the scalar cloud can not exceed that of the condensate . in fig.[fig.8 ] , we plot the function @xmath177 as function of the distance , and it is possible to see that this critical situation occurs close to 0.6 fm . on the other hand , the value 1/100 , for which the pion field may be considere as weak , occurs around 1.5 fm , suggesting that this is the order of magnitude of the distances beyond which perturbative calculations may be considered as reliable .",
    "eq.([23 ] - dashed line ) , @xmath167 eq.([39 ] - dotted line ) and @xmath178 ( continuous line).,width=566 ]    in order to explore this picture further , we recall that the nucleon @xmath82-term is related to @xmath179 by @xmath180 the evaluation of this integral , using @xmath181 and replacing this function by @xmath182 whenever @xmath183 , yields @xmath184 mev , quite close to the value quoted in ref.@xcite . this somewhat surprising result is associated with the factor @xmath185 in eq.([34 ] ) , that suppresses the integrand at small distances , and seems to indicate that other mechanisms contribute little to scalar dynamics .",
    "another interesting aspect of expression ( [ 39 ] ) is that it allows one to study the behaviour of the scalar form factor in the large @xmath94 limit , where the nucleon and the delta become both heavy and degenerate . in that limit one has @xmath186 and hence , @xmath187 ^ 2 \\;. \\label{42}\\ ] ]",
    "this expression is identical with that obtained in the framework of the skyrme model , where @xmath188 and , for large distances , one has@xcite @xmath189 this result , when combined with the fact that the model accounts well for the opep , shows that skyrmions do have asymptotic properties consistent with precise perturbative calculations in the large @xmath94 limit . on the other hand , in the perturbative approach",
    ", the departure from this limit is very important , suggesting that some of the quantitative limitations of the skyrme model may be associated with the intrinsic @xmath190-@xmath40 degeneracy .",
    "in this work we studied the central @xmath0 potential at large distances and have emphasized the special role played by the nucleon scalar form factor , which describes the mass density of its pion cloud .",
    "the effect of this cloud over the other nucleon , represented as a multipole expansion , dominates the asymptotic interaction .",
    "this rather simple picture accounts for about 75% of the potential , as given by the precise phenomenological fit by the argonne group .",
    "we have evaluated this leading contribution , due to the exchange of two pions , and determined its dependence on the nucleon mass , using the relativistic formalism .",
    "our results coincide with those of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory when the nucleon mass is taken to infinity , but become about 20% smaller when the empirical mass is used .",
    "this shows that it is important to keep the nucleon mass finite in precise descriptions of the @xmath0 system .    in a recent work , becher and leutwyler",
    "have shown that the scalar form factor is determined by an intermediate @xmath6 amplitude , close to the threshold at @xmath35 , which lies almost on top of a branch point . as a consequence",
    ", the heavy baryon expansion does not make sense for the scalar form factor .",
    "we have investigated the implications of this result for the @xmath0 interaction and found out that threshold effects can be seen at very large distances only .",
    "therefore , in principle , hbchpt could account numerically for the discrepancy between the heavy baryon limit and reality found in the central potential , but this would require the extension of existing calculations to higher orders .",
    "this stresses the advantage of the relativistic framework , namely that it does not deal with truncated expressions and hence gives rise automatically to leading contributions which are already rather accurate .",
    "a fully covariant description of the @xmath0 interaction , including other degrees of freedom , will be presented elsewhere .",
