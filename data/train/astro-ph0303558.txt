    "among the illuminati of cosmology , a paper that proposes to study  clouds in voids , and further seeks to model them as remnants of sub - galactic perturbations , is likely to be viewed as an anomaly ; n - body / hydro simulations have had such success in reproducing the detailed nature of the  forest ( , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this view is supported by the conclusions of @xcite regarding the hit / miss statistics of moderate redshift  absorbers in double or group quasars . the possibility that these hit / miss statistics could instead be the signature of the clustering of small clouds",
    "was considered , and rejected without a thorough analysis @xcite kpc ( , `` local groups '' ) . ] . nor are  clouds expected to be found in voids at @xmath5 in any significant numbers , for in voids , the diffuse filaments expand with the hubble flow and disperse to below the current limits of detectability at redshifts @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there exists now some considerable history of detections of low - redshift  clouds in voids @xcite , suggesting that perhaps void clouds are not as rare as the simulations would imply .",
    "likewise , the discovery of compact high velocity clouds ( chvcs ) in the galactic neighborhood @xcite , which are successfully modeled as partially held by dark matter @xcite , suggests that sub - galactic halos with associated  gas may not be as unlikely as previously thought .    at issue",
    "is not just the specific disposition of dark matter and baryons in vast , dark , under - dense regions .",
    "the observations of clouds at low - redshift , where complete galaxy catalogs can be used to calculate their relative isolation , may provide a crucial test of the n - body simulations that play such a central role in informing our picture of process on the cosmic scale .",
    "simulations have effectively been calibrated by the use of the high - redshift  forest . under the assumption that dark matter ( dm ) can be characterized by a 3-dimensional power spectrum @xmath7 @xcite , and that gas traces dm except at the smallest scales , where pressure forces are thought to be important @xcite ,",
    "@xmath7 is derived from high - redshift  forest spectra , and used to model the initial conditions of simulations .",
    "the  forest thus became a testing ground for simulations , enabling researchers to gradually refine their code to a point that there is now excellent agreement with observations of a wide range of forest properties @xcite .",
    "these simulations show structure formation and movement of matter from low , to high density regions in response to peculiar gravitational fields .",
    "for instance , @xcite use an open cdm model to follow the transferral of matter from underdense , to overdense regions , showing that over 90% of the mass in overdense ( which we will later refer to as `` shocked '' ) regions at @xmath4 arrived after @xmath8 .",
    "the challenging task of following the movement of gas in a simulated cosmological context is handled by concentrating baryonic and dark mass into baryon and dark matter `` particles '' , typically of mass @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , respectively @xcite . due to this coarseness , small galactic and subgalactic halos can not be represented .",
    "thus , the baryons that could have been associated with smaller halos are distributed in a smooth manner through the large diffuse structures",
    ". however , the response of the particles to gravity produces convergent motions which are interpreted as absorption lines  an effect known as the `` fluctuating gunn - peterson effect '' @xcite .",
    "artificial spectra are typically extracted by smoothing groups of particles with a spline kernel with a radial scale that is dependent on the density @xcite so that gas resolution varies from @xmath11 to @xmath12 kpc for high , and low density regions , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , even if sub - galactic halos could be resolved , the dynamics of the behavior of baryons in the halo could not be realistically represented since the distribution of gas is determined completely by the spline function , which has no physical foundation .    in attempting to characterize the nature of the evolution of structure seen in simulations , two broad types of environments are detected . in @xcite these environments",
    "are characterized as `` shocked '' and `` unshocked '' , while in @xcite , they are `` warm / hot '' , and `` warm '' . in either case , the filling factors , and the physics contributing to the physical state of the gas are approximately the same .",
    "the clouds in warm / hot , or shocked regions are collapsing structures , and are shock heated , while the warm , unshocked clouds characterize underdense regions in which gas is expanding with the hubble flow , and is hence adiabatically cooled . in @xcite ,",
    "the collapsing regions are thought to comprise about 10% of the volume of the universe at the present time . in the simulations of @xcite and @xcite , clouds at high redshift",
    "populate both overdense and underdense regions , but for @xmath13 , absorbers are thought to arise in regions that are overdense by factors of 12 to 100 ; stronger lines originating close to galaxies , and weaker lines distributed in the diffuse filamentary structure .    at @xmath14 ,",
    "the situation is different ; the apparent lack of a modulation in the incidence of  absorbers on velocity scales appropriate to galaxy superclusters or voids in high - redshift spectra prompted @xcite to conclude that voids in the  cloud distribution can fill no more than 5% of the universe at @xmath15 , a result corroborated by others .",
    "however , the area is murky ( see the review by @xcite for a discussion ) since how one defines a  cloud void depends on an arbitrary detection threshold .",
    "however , the movement of this proto - void material toward mass concentrations will tend to evacuate them .",
    "simulations of voids by @xcite suggest that no galaxy of any size is expected to currently populate voids of size @xmath16 mpc .",
    "however , studies show that there are much larger voids , with an average diameter greater than twice as large ( ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but void simulations of @xcite appear to imply that larger voids have generally lower densities .",
    "however , the relatively large galaxy density within the huge botes void @xcite , and the subsequent detection of other galaxies in 21 cm emission @xcite , suggests that larger voids may retain halos when smaller voids may not .    the assumption that baryons trace a diffuse dm distribution , and not smaller , sub - galactic potentials ,",
    "can , in principle be tested by the search for  absorbers in local voids . for ,",
    "if absorbers are diffuse , they will have expanded with the hubble flow and now be so diffuse that they are unobservable @xcite , while if they are held by sub - galactic halos , the gravitational potentials may be sufficient to restrain the evaporation of baryons and produce absorbers .",
    "observations of low - redshift  clouds , aided by galaxy catalogs , can be used to determine the relative isolation of clouds , and may thus help to resolve these issues .",
    "for instance , hubble space telescope ( hst ) spectra have detected numerous  clouds for which no nearby galaxy was found @xcite .",
    "however , the methodology used by these investigators , though useful for gaining insight into the low redshift universe , does not facilitate the study of void clouds in any systematic way . for , `` nearest neighbor '' measures of a cloud s isolation weights galaxies equally , whether dwarf or giant , and so lacks the sensitivity to mass that is intuitively attached to the concept of isolation .",
    "a new method for resolving the environments of  clouds is presented in @xcite ( hereafter paper 1 ) .",
    "it uses ambient tidal fields , calculated from galaxy catalogs , as a relative measure of a cloud s isolation , and thus weights the effects of galaxies by their mass , and by the inverse cube of the distance .",
    "clouds can then be sorted by their degrees of isolation .",
    "a catalog of clouds can , for instance , be divided into two ; one sub - catalog with clouds abiding in ambient tidal fields less than some arbitrary tide @xmath17 , and one with tide greater .",
    "the analysis of sub - catalogs into distribution functions can then be undertaken .",
    "it was found that clouds in low tidal field environments display significantly different characteristics than those in high tidal field environments .    when represented in a log - log plot , the equivalent width distribution function ( ewdf ) is accurately fit by a power - law .",
    "the left - hand illustration of fig .",
    "[ fig - ewds2 ] shows the ewdf of  clouds , using all data irrespective of tidal field ( heavy solid line ) .",
    "the break in the distribution , seen at @xmath18 ( @xmath19 m , where @xmath20 is the rest equivalent width of the  absorber in m ) is suggestive of two distinct populations of clouds represented in the data .",
    "the thin solid and dashed lines represent number weighted fits to the data at @xmath21 m , and @xmath22 m , respectively .",
    "the values of the slopes are shown .",
    "these results strongly suggest that isolated clouds exist in a different kind of environment than un - isolated clouds .",
    "note that the ewdf of _ isolated _ clouds ( fig .",
    "[ fig - ewds2 ] , left - hand plot , dotted line ) closely matches the fit to the low ew part of the mean ewdf .",
    "this convincingly shows that isolated clouds constitute the `` second '' population ( the low - ew side ) seen in the mean ewdf .",
    "as it happens , there are virtually no low ew clouds in the un - isolated space ( see , fig . 13 in paper 1 ) .",
    "i parenthetically note that the line density of void clouds at @xmath23 ( , about 225 m ) is on order 7 per unit redshift .",
    "this is about @xmath24 of the mean value ; certainly not orders of magnitude less , as implied by simulations of @xcite .",
    "henceforth , i shall identify voids as regions that are isolated , where isolation is determined by the smallness of the scalar value of the summed tidal field ( see  3 of paper 1 ) .",
    "the line density of _ void _ clouds at @xmath25 m  is @xmath26 , and the spectral slope is steep @xmath27 ( paper 1 , table 2 ) .",
    "in contrast , the slope of the volume - weighted ( , mean ) ewdf for @xmath22 m  is @xmath28 , while non - void clouds have quite flat ewdfs ; @xmath29 .",
    "void clouds appear to actually dominate the mean ewdf at low ew .    the right - hand plot of fig .",
    "[ fig - ewds2 ] shows the trends of fitting parameters with changes in limiting values of tide @xmath17 , for both void ( lower sub - panels ) and non - void catalogs ( upper sub - panels ) .",
    "the tide is given in units of inverse hubble time squared ( see paper 1 ) so that values are of order unity .",
    "there is a relatively narrow transition zone separating clearly distinct ( linearly varying ) trends in fitting parameters for void ( low @xmath30 ) , and non - void ( high @xmath30 ) environments ( note the vertical dotted lines ) .",
    "the transition zone provides a _ phenomenological _",
    "basis for establishing the tidal field which separates void from non - void clouds . in this way",
    ", it is shown that the space containing void - type clouds fills @xmath31 of the universe ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the @xmath32 filling factor implied by @xcite .",
    "i summarize these introductory comments by noting that ( 1 ) n - body / hydro simulations appear to predict that the great majority of low-@xmath33  clouds are in the diffuse filamentary structure around galaxies , and not in voids .",
    "( 2 ) the environmentally - resolved observations of  clouds in paper 1 show that most observed clouds lie in the unshocked void region , even without corrections for the much smaller redshift coverage of spectra at high sensitivity .",
    "( 3 ) the lack of the ability to resolve cloud halos in n - body / hydro simulations may be the principal cause for the inability to predict the existence of this population of void clouds .",
    "the foregoing tentative conclusions already throw suspicion on some of the results of the simulations .",
    "is it that simulations fail to predict void clouds entirely ?",
    "two questions need to be answered ; first , can diffuse clouds , expanding with the hubble flow , explain the observed void clouds ? secondly ,",
    "if not , can sub - galactic halos provide the gravitational potential needed to retain enough gas to produce detectable absorption systems ? this is , in short , the purpose of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec - dave ] i investigate whether diffuse sheets of gas are capable of explaining the observed void ewdf , as envisioned in simulations .",
    "i find that diffuse sheets expanding with the hubble flow are not consistent with observations .",
    "the remainder of the paper assumes the clouds are associated with sub - galactic halos , and that baryons are subject to pressure gradients after the reionization of the universe , and tend to expand away from their halos . in  [ sec - analytic ]",
    "i present a general analytical treatment of spherical clouds to show the relationship between the baryon density profile and the slope of the column density spectrum . in ",
    "[ sec - lagr ] i introduce the hydro / gravity simulation that will chart the evaporation of baryons from dark matter halos , in response to the re - ionization of the universe .",
    "these halos are initially viewed as fully formed and not accreting . in  [ sec - results ]",
    "i present the results of these simulations , based on a range of halo circular velocities and two halo types .",
    "section [ sec - modeling ] presents a series of strategies for fitting model column density spectra to the observations of paper 1 . in ",
    "[ sec - extending ] i allow that clouds may accrete sub - halos , and so grow continuously from @xmath34 to the present ; the products at @xmath4 are presented , and the results are compared to those with fixed halos . in  [ sec - bval ]",
    "i reconcile doppler parameters of model absorbers with those of the observed void clouds . in ",
    "[ sec - summary ] i summarize my findings .",
    "to determine the nature of void clouds under the current paradigm , one needs to know the fraction of neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "assume that clouds are optically thin , and immersed in a radiation field with an average flux @xmath35 , where @xmath36 @xcite is the spectral index shortward of the lyman limit @xmath37 .",
    "for the local universe , i assume , @xmath38 @xcite . for ionization equilibrium , @xmath39 @xcite , where @xmath40 is the case - a recombination rate coefficient appropriate for diffuse clouds .",
    "the photoionization rate is given by , @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 represents the hydrogen cross - section for absorption of a photon of frequency @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "the expected neutral fraction is , from eq . [ eq - nh1 ] , @xmath46 note that in a highly ionized plasma , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "given that @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , the hydrogen density is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the total mass density of a cloud in units of the critical .",
    "given @xmath49 , the mean hydrogen density is @xmath54 for @xmath55 k , @xmath56 .",
    "i note that the time - scale for ionization equilibrium is small ; @xmath57 thus , ionization equilibrium is a safe assumption .",
    "now assume that large relatively homogeneous clouds exist in voids , as generically predicted by simulations , and that they are producing the isolated absorbers discovered in paper 1 .",
    "assume that @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 is the total mass density in voids ) . from eq .",
    "[ eq - nf ] , the neutral fraction is , @xmath60 where the index of @xmath61 is the slope of the recombination coefficient @xcite .",
    "@xcite derive a relation between the temperature and the density from simulated data , @xmath62 the exponent , 0.6 , is actually an increasing function of decreasing redshift and increases with reionization redshift , but 0.6 appears consistent with @xmath4 values @xcite . according to eq .",
    "4 of @xcite , @xmath63 at @xmath4 .",
    "the over - density required to produce a column density @xmath64 is @xmath65 , or @xmath66 . with eq .",
    "[ eq - temp ]",
    "i derive a temperature @xmath67 k. substituting this into eq .",
    "[ eq - nf2 ] , the neutral fraction of hydrogen is found to be @xmath68 .",
    "thus the length of the column needed to produce the absorber is , @xmath69 if the filament is expanding with the hubble flow , then the velocity width , ignoring thermal broadening , would be @xmath70 . because the background mass density in voids is expected to be about an order of magnitude less than in the filamentary medium surrounding galaxies , the frequency of fluctuations of amplitude @xmath71 will be very much smaller in voids than in non - void regions .    for @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 k and @xmath76 mpc .",
    "the implication is clear ; absorbers formed in this fashion would be seen only as very broad troughs",
    ". the hubble flow across @xmath77 would then be well beyond the values found in the space telescope infrared spectrograph echelle spectra @xcite .",
    "in ghrs spectra with resolution is @xmath78  @xcite , void clouds have  doppler parameters , @xmath79  ( paper 1 ) , probably large by a factor of @xmath80 due to resolution problems , and the presence of components @xcite .",
    "thus void clouds have doppler parameters only 1/5 to 1/10 as large as that which diffuse sheets would produce in voids .    in conclusion",
    ", it appears clear that the detected void absorbers must be either significantly denser than the mean density ( , @xmath81 ) , or the velocity field of the baryons must be strongly convergent with respect to the hubble flow , or both .",
    "neither of these conditions is consistent with the model of void clouds as diffuse baryonic slabs expanding with the hubble flow .",
    "thus , observations appear to be in conflict with the paradigm promoted by the n - body simulations as applied to  clouds .    in the following section we begin our analysis of sub - galactic perturbations as a parent population for void clouds .",
    "if homogeneous slabs of gas expanding with the universe can not explain these clouds , then what might ?",
    "i hypothesize that absorbers stem from sub - galactic perturbations that were massive enough to restrain the outflow of gas from the dispersive tendencies of the hubble flow and the pressure gradients that result from the ionizing background .",
    "i start with an analytic treatment of clouds taken as baryons held within a `` mini - halo '' @xcite .",
    "clouds whose evaporation is restrained by a centrally condensed halo of dark matter will have a radial density gradient . if such clouds can be roughly approximated by power law density profiles , their ionization structure , and column density spectra can be calculated .",
    "i initially assume that the baryons of a cloud have a spherically symmetric power - law distribution with index @xmath82 ; @xmath83    eq . [ eq - nf ] shows that @xmath84 . the column density produced at projected",
    "radius @xmath85 from the cloud center is , @xmath86 where @xmath77 is constrained by the equation @xmath87 . from eqs .",
    "[ eq - nf ] and [ eq - colden1 ] we find , @xmath88      what column density spectrum would a cosmological distribution of such clouds produce ?",
    "the cumulative column density spectrum may be broken down by the chain rule , @xmath89 where @xmath90 . the relative number @xmath91 of absorption systems produced by a spherically symmetric system with a column density @xmath92 at projected radius @xmath85 has a derivative , @xmath93 . by eqs .",
    "[ eq - nh1 ] and [ eq - den - profile ] , @xmath94 .",
    "then by eq .",
    "[ eq - colden1 ] , @xmath95 carrying out the derivatives in eq .",
    "[ eq - diffl ] and simplifying , @xmath96 which is the differential distribution .",
    "the cumulative column density distribution has a slope larger by 1 ; @xmath97 the inversion of this yields , @xmath98    these two equations provide an important diagnostic of the observed column density spectrum ( cds ) if we are to interpret it as produced by discrete , spherically distributed clouds , because it determines the cloud density profile that is consistent with a given cds slope .",
    "note that the steeper the index of the density profile @xmath82 , the flatter the spectral slope @xmath99 .",
    "for instance , the observed slope of the void cloud ewdf , @xmath100 can be explained if @xmath101 ; , @xmath102 , while the slope for non void clouds ( @xmath103 ) is explained if @xmath104 .",
    "for baryons associated with dark halos , it is not expected that baryons would follow their halo mass distribution at late times ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * )  one might expect a flatter distribution owing to the effects of evaporation . as noted above , the steep ewdf of void clouds ( fig .",
    "[ fig - ewds2 ] ) imply a relatively flat density profile ; this may be a measure of the effects of reionization on baryons held by small dark matter ( dm ) halos .",
    "these considerations suggest that the clouds producing the absorption in voids have evolved into a rather flat density profile . a more accurate view of the probable profiles of such clouds may be achieved by a cosmological simulation of the response of dm - held clouds to reionization .",
    "i propose to follow in detail the likely evolution of baryons in clouds gravitationally held by dark halos before reionization ( @xmath105 , @xcite ) .",
    "as noted above and in paper 1 , 3-d simulations suffer from space- and mass - resolution problems when small - scale structures are of interest , making it difficult to separate actual physical results from numerical artifacts .",
    "when small - scale structure needs to be studied , a 1-d code may provide a solution to the problem .",
    "i acquired a copy of a 1-dimensional lagrangian hydro / gravity code of @xcite courtesy of one of its authors , ( a. t. ) , and adapted it to the needs presented by the problem posed above . among the adaptations made was the transformation from einstein - de sitter universe to a flat frw ( @xmath106 ) with @xmath107 , and the writing of initializing routines for various halo models .",
    "these are consistent with the parameters used in paper 1 .",
    "a cosmic baryon ratio @xmath108 is assumed .",
    "the code sets the value of the gravitational constant @xmath109 to unity .",
    "in addition , it sets a mass scale , @xmath110 , and a length scale @xmath111 au , or 22.592 kpc , mandating a time scale @xmath112 s , or @xmath113 myr .",
    "the equations , and related details of the computational scheme that forms the basis for tracking the evolution of the clouds are detailed in @xcite .",
    "the basic components are recapitulated as follows .",
    "ionization equilibrium is assumed because its time - scale is smaller than the time - scales of interest .",
    "the energetic gain @xmath114 from photoionization of ,  and  by uv photons is calculated on the basis of self - consistent concentrations of these components .",
    "we assume that the spectral index above the lyman limit follows the relation , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 , ( , * ? ? ?",

    "the redshift variation of @xmath117 is adapted from @xcite , and is shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig - j0 ] .",
    "the radiative losses , @xmath118 , are found by summing the cooling rates from collisional excitation and ionization , recombination , and bremsstrahlung , given the ionic abundances and the density @xcite . in the lagrangian code ,",
    "bin boundaries for baryons respond to the effects of pressure differentials and gravitational potential gradients .",
    "the change in the internal energy per unit mass @xmath119 with time is then , @xmath120 where the first term on the right hand side is the adiabatic loss ; @xmath121 is the pressure , and the @xmath122-subscript refers to corresponding values for gas - bins .",
    "shocks occur when motions are convergent .",
    "the artificial viscosity technique of @xcite is used , adjusted to spread shocks over 4 or 5 shells , helping to ensure energy conservation @xcite .",
    "the pressure is given by the equation of state , @xmath123 the baryonic component responds to forces as follows , @xmath124 where @xmath125 includes dark and baryonic mass , @xmath126 is the pressure differential over a lagrangian bin , and @xmath127 is the gas mass contained therein .",
    "the time - step for the simulation is determined by the smallest of a collection of time scales , including the dynamical timescale , the courant , and the cooling time scales , and a time - scale to ensure that fluid shells do not cross .",
    "in addition there is a maximum length time - step of @xmath128 .",
    "the minimum time - scale is frequently determined by the dynamical time - scale in the first few shells . when the timescale for cooling is much less than the dynamical time scale , shells are essentially in free - fall .",
    "this causes the central density to increase dramatically so that cooling time steps become extremely small . in response to this problem ,",
    "when @xmath129 the program `` freezes '' the shells in question , and refers the mass to a minimum radius , here , @xmath130  essentially taking the mass in the shell out of gas form ( we might speculatively suggest that gas fragments and forms stars in the collapse zone ) . in practice , this does not occur for systems of circular velocity less than @xmath131 or 24 , for @xcite ( hereafter , nfw ) and isothermal halos , respectively .",
    "since this is an investigation of clouds and not galaxies , i ignore systems of larger circular velocity .",
    "i check that the point at which shells are frozen is physically realistic by monitoring the ratio of the diameter of the first lagrangian bin to the jeans length , given by @xmath132 where @xmath133 is taken to be @xmath134 , and @xmath135 is the mass per particle in units of the hydrogen atom , that approaches the value @xmath136 at the low densities of model clouds at low to moderate redshifts .",
    "this indicator is found to approach unity shortly before the shells are frozen , indicating that the program is treating the problem correctly .",
    "it is possible that starting with a less - relaxed halo , warmed by secondary infall at @xmath137 , halos of circular velocity high enough to collapse in this way under the current arrangement , would not collapse .",
    "this implies that clouds of somewhat larger circular velocity could exist without forming stars ( see  [ sec - extending ] ) .",
    "because the @xcite code was originally written for collapsing protogalactic clouds , the program s treatment of dm is inappropriate for the present simulation .",
    "instead , a dark halo overdensity is established and not allowed to change ( these halos are to be specified below ) .",
    "it would be more proper to project a dark halo as it would be at a high redshift , growing somewhat by secondary infall , so that the end product is consistent with the specified circular velocity .",
    "however , of this there are two views ; one states that the halo of a small cloud is in place by @xmath34 ( see @xcite ) with time .",
    "] , so that most of the response to absorbed radiant energy is at redshifts in which the total cloud mass is fairly stable . in this scenario , therefore , assuming a fixed halo circular velocity can only modestly minimize the final extent of cloud expansion due to its greater average potential . however , the other view is based on observations suggesting the growth of halos , even at late times . therefore , after applying the analyses to fixed halos , we then allow halos to grow steadily by accretion of sub - halos , leading to a growth of circular velocity with time .",
    "these `` grown '' halos are subjected to the same analysis as the fixed halos , providing a plausible maximal range for reasonable models of halo growth .",
    "the spherically symmetric conditions of the simulation presume that the halos are isolated from the influences of others .",
    "this approximation should be accurate for void clouds since the environment around them is expanding with the hubble flow , and evaporation ejecta are not likely to interact with that of other isolated systems .",
    "however , it would not likely apply to non - void space because in the convergent flows of over - dense regions , cloud outflows may collide causing shocks , that violate the isolation and spherical symmetry assumed in this simulation .",
    "the initial conditions of model clouds are designed to make them dynamically stable .",
    "because the central densities of clouds are supposed to approximate the density of the universe at the redshift of their formation ( the canonical explanation for the high concentration parameters of small systems in relation to those of large systems found in simulated halos ) , i assume that the halos i model are already in place at @xmath34 . there may be some confusion on this issue because it is seen that the virial mass of even small halos continues to grow down to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , the virial radius is approximately equal to the radius within which the average density is @xmath138",
    ". therefore , the decline in the background density with the expansion of the universe causes an expansion of the virial radius , resulting in an increase in the virial mass with time . comparisons with code kindly lent from j. bullock ( `` cvir.f '' ) show that , for clouds with @xmath139 , there is very little increase in mass , or decrease in the concentration parameter over and above that which naturally results from the expansion of the universe .",
    "therefore , from the standpoint of current thinking , assuming that the halos were in place at @xmath34 should be non - controversial",
    ". however , from the standpoint of the isothermal model , this may not be true .",
    "accordingly , we do investigate halos which grow steadily in ",
    "[ sec - extending ] .",
    "in deciding the initial conditions of the gas associated with a `` fixed '' dark halo ( , fixed circular velocity @xmath140 and overdensity profile ) , it is important to note that at high redshift the baryonic cloud is immersed in a critical density background with density comparable to that of the cloud . for , at z=4.84",
    "the background density is 200 times the current critical density , thereby making the virial radius significantly smaller than at the present . because baryons are dissipational",
    ", there is no way to separate the baryons that are part of the overdensity from those that are part of the background .",
    "in fact , what allows for the existence of a prolonged and stable overdensity is a distortion in the hubble flow that is concentric about a point we would call the center of the cloud .",
    "since these halos are immersed in a high - redshift universe , their overdensity exists by virtue of this deviation from the hubble flow .",
    "at the initialization stage , an outward motion is given to the gas that is less than , but gradually approaches the hubble flow velocity as one considers radii farther from the cloud center in a manner such that the overdensity is stable in time .",
    "this is actually easier than it sounds , for one need only give an outward velocity such that the radial flux of gas is what it would be if the universe were flat and of critical density .",
    "thus , at a given redshift @xmath33 , the outward motion of gaseous matter @xmath141 needed to maintain a density @xmath142 at a distance @xmath143 , for instance , should equal , @xmath144 where the variables , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 are evaluated at the redshift in question .",
    "this creates an overdensity that is stable within the hubble flow ( the peculiar velocity supports the overdensity ) .",
    "the dark matter is given the same peculiar velocity field .",
    "the velocity field that results can be expressed as proper radial motion ( including the hubble flow ) as well as peculiar velocity , with the hubble flow subtracted .    because of the exigencies of a lagrangian code , and the apparent lack of evidence for a truncation of halos at the virial radius , it was decided not to impose a radial truncation of the overdensity of halo models .",
    "the halos were extended to a distance at which the average internal _ _",
    "over__density in units of the current critical density was @xmath148 , equivalent to a distance of @xmath149 mpc from an @xmath150 galaxy with an isothermal ( hereafter referred to as isot ) model halo .",
    "later , when estimates of the average density contributed by clouds are required , it will be possible to impose a truncation radius , such as that featured in paper 1 .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that there are no features in the simulation products that would imply that the mass is truncated at any characteristic radius , nor does the preponderance of observational evidence ( see below ) require it ; only n - body simulations suggest something like that might be required .",
    "since the extent of gravity is infinite , halos have the tendency to draw matter toward them incrementally at great distances .",
    "initially , baryons are taken to `` follow '' the dm , so there is an inward peculiar gravity acting on the baryons . to restrain baryon collapse ,",
    "i initially constrain the cloud to have a temperature such that the pressure exactly balances the peculiar gravity in each bin .",
    "this will not guarantee that clouds are static because cooling rates vary within the cloud , however , it is dynamically stable .",
    "for instance , if the simulation is started at @xmath151 , instead of 6.5 , the baryons will `` slosh '' about within their halo , but when ionization begins , the cloud expands , producing a result remarkably similar to those with simulations begun at @xmath34 .",
    "it turns out that the details of the temperature structure is relatively unimportant because , for clouds with virial temperature @xmath152 k , the cooling time - scale is large , suggesting that clouds are fairly stable before reionization .",
    "further , the energy deposited upon reionization dwarfs the initial energy content , so that the effect of the initial temperature on cloud dynamics is insignificant .",
    "other tests showed that the final state of the cloud is also quite insensitive to variations in the specific prescription for the onset of the ionizing flux ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - j0 ] ) .",
    "thus , final results are sensitive only to halo type and circular velocity .      in the initialization stage of the program ,",
    "the halo model and its dm circular velocity are specified , and the total mass of the cloud in dm and baryons derived therefrom are calculated according to the cloud halo model , extending to a radius at which the internal over - density is 2 times the critical .",
    "this ensures a large enough scale to capture the relevant dynamics of expansion , and guarantee that all observable column densities occur within the cloud end - products .",
    "the mass is then divided equally into the number of lagrangian bins to be used ( generally , the number of gas bins are set to @xmath153 , and the dark matter divided into @xmath154 bins )",
    ". then the initial radius at which these masses are found is determined by straightforward application of model relations ( see  5.1 ) .",
    "this study considers halos which are isothermal as well as nfw halos .",
    "i do not truncate these halos at the virial radius because what is of interest is the mass distribution of the halos , rather their kinetic properties .",
    "numerous studies now support the claim that there is no sign of a drop in the index of the density profile beyond the virial radius , or for that matter , the nfw radius of maximum circular velocity ( , * ? ? ?",

    "this is very suggestive of a mass distribution that is not truncated ; one not inconsistent with an isothermal mass distribution . to make the distinction clear , when i refer to a halo",
    ", i am referring to the mass distribution , rather than the mass in the virialized portion thereof .",
    "it is expected that the mass of the early halo will generate peculiar velocities in the surrounding universe , contributing to an enhancement of the density outside the virialized region of the halo .",
    "the nfw halo : the nfw halo is treated in considerable detail in paper 1 .",
    "equations 34 to 40 of paper 1 describe the derivation of the scaling relations of the model , which are necessary for calculating halo parameters as a function of halo circular velocity .",

    "the nfw halo has a cuspy core , with density approaching @xmath167 as @xmath143 goes to zero .",
    "the isothermal halo : in paper 1 , the isothermal halo ( which i will henceforth abbreviate as isot ) was used to model the total mass of galaxies , and so required no internal structure to be stated .",

    "a sense of the redshift can be had by recognizing that the density at the extreme edge of the cloud is @xmath175 .",
    "the principal distinction between the isot and nfw density profile evolution is that isot has a softer outflowing wave , and a significantly larger central density at the conclusion of the run .",

    "thus the volume in which the three low @xmath30 clouds appear is almost exactly the same as the volume in which the two at @xmath341 clouds appear , making it seem likely that large clouds may be more prevalent in deep voids than in the void periphery .",
    "but the statistics are small , and we would be wise to seek more data before forming a conclusion .    a possible explanation for those clouds that produce the excess above the model at @xmath342 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - cds - const - alph ] ) is that there exist clouds / proto - galaxies in voids with halo velocities @xmath343 , for the analysis of the cds of individual clouds shows that the larger the circular velocity of a cloud , the flatter the slope of the cds that it produces ; such additions would produce more absorbers at @xmath344 to 14 ( ) . this can be understood by noting that the more massive the cloud , the more strongly it will hold its baryons , producing a steep density gradient at the edge , and resulting in a flat cds ( eqs .",
    "[ eq - cds - slope1 ] and [ eq - cds - slope2 ] ) .",
    "recall that the gas in larger halos ( @xmath345 ) collapse and produce stars in the 1-d simulations .",
    "however , if clouds have grown from hierarchical merging during their evolution , they would have been smaller during the early , high - density stages of evolution , achieving their larger size only recently .",
    "because of the early evaporation of baryons from their core region , there might not be sufficient baryonic mass in the core to produce the cooling needed to trigger star formation .",
    "therefore , with growing halos , the limiting circular velocity ( as measured at @xmath4 ) for sf is probably higher than 25 .",
    "but before pursuing this line of thought , it is important to consider the repercussions of taking literally the significant steep cds slope at @xmath316  noted above .      as noted in  [ sec - isot ] , the low column density end of the void cds can be well - fit by an hvdf with a very steep slope parameter @xmath346 . in this section",
    "i inspect the physical repercussions of this . as argued in ",
    "[ subsec - comp - klypin ] , the hvdf may be simplified by removing the exponential ( eq . [ eq - slf ] ) when @xmath347 .",
    "consider logarithmic bins of @xmath140 such as was used in the simulations here ; construct the bins such that each bin has a width @xmath348 , where @xmath349 is some appropriate constant .",
    "then from eq .",
    "[ eq - hvdf ] , the number density of systems within a bin is , @xmath350 thus , the comoving number density per bin scales as @xmath351 when @xmath352 , each logarithmic bin has an equal number of systems in it .",
    "however , when we consider the mass in each bin , we must multiply the number density by the mass per object .    for the isot halo , the mass scales as @xmath353 ( eq . [ eq - scale - iso ] ) , @xmath354 that has equal masses in logarithmic bins when @xmath355 for @xmath273 .",
    "for this value of @xmath268 , the mass function is flat in logarithmic bins .    for the nfw halo , virial mass @xmath356 eq .",
    "[ eq - scale - nfw ] ) .",
    "the nfw bin mass is a somewhat different relation , @xmath357 that has equal masses in logarithmic bins when @xmath358 for the same @xmath359 .",
    "recall that a cds formed using isot cloud profiles and a hvdf with @xmath360 would have an increasing mass in bins of progressively smaller velocity @xmath140 , implying a divergence of the integrated mass .",
    "the sobering implications of this fact are softened , however , if sub - clustering is occurring .",
    "further , it is reasonable that sub - halos should form in the flanks of larger halos , for the time - scale for collapse of perturbations is proportional to the inverse square root of the density , making it more likely for them to form there than in the regions between clouds .",
    "thus , many of the small clouds that are detected in the cds may not be independent , isolated clouds , but loosely associated with larger clouds . since they are fashioned out of the stuff of the main cloud , they are not taken to add to its mass , unless such sub - halos are found to lie outside the truncation radius @xmath255 .",
    "if sub - condensations exist , then accretion or hierarchical agglomeration is a distinct possibility in the halos of  clouds in voids .",
    "up to this point , the halos that have been used were fixed at @xmath34 .",
    "such halos remained star - free only up to circular velocities of only up to @xmath361  (  [ sec - results ] ) .",
    "however , the steep spectral slope of the void cds at low column density appeared to require the presence of sub - clustered halos , since otherwise the indicative mass function would diverge .",
    "likewise , it is difficult to reconcile the existence of chvcs @xcite with mass approaching @xmath362 @xcite , with model clouds having maximum  masses only @xmath363 .",
    "the behavior of the observed cds relative to model cds thus suggests the possibility of continued accretion and halo growth during the period from @xmath34 to the present ; that sub - halos cluster about larger halos implies that the circular velocities of clouds could grow by the accretion of those halos ; their growth would explain the presence of chvcs of the faintest local group dsph ( l. blitz , private communication 2002 ) ] with masses approaching @xmath364 .",

    "[ fig - mh1 ] , halos of velocity @xmath365  could reach this  mass .",
    "recall , however , that attempts to run models of such large halo velocities failed for fixed halos , because the central baryonic core , thought to roughly follow the dark matter before reionization , was not able to support itself , as described in  [ sec - results ] . however , if halos are slowly `` grown '' , such as by accretion , then larger halo velocities at @xmath4 may be attainable without these indications of star formation , with  masses more in line with observations of chvcs may be attained .    in what follows ,",
    "i adopt this model of accretion .",
    "a rough approximation of that growth rate was made by assuming that the largest fixed cloud that escapes collapse into star formation , could grow to the largest cloud which today has an  mass of @xmath362 , as asserted by @xcite .",
    "the circular velocity of that halo was approximated by connecting the trend in  mass with fixed - halo circular velocity to the maximum cloud  mass of @xmath362 ( see fig . [ fig - mh1 ] ) .",
    "the clouds are `` grown '' gradually , that is , by inserting increments of mass into the lagrangian bins at each time step in a way that mimics the equation , @xmath366 where @xmath367 is the circular velocity at @xmath34 , the accretion constant @xmath368 in units of inverse hubble times @xmath369 , and @xmath370 is in units of @xmath371 . as dm is gradually loaded into the dm bins , their physical extents are scaled - up to mimic the larger core - radius of larger clouds ( see  5.1.1 of paper 1 for scaling relations ) .",
    "mass is added to the baryonic bins in the same way , however , the radial positions are not altered directly , but allowed to evolve according to the pressure gradients and total gravity of the cloud .",
    "this approximation may result in a slightly more concentrated distribution of baryons than if the gas was originally associated with the accreting sub - halos .",
    "but the inward migration of dm would tend to pull the gas inward anyway .",
    "it appears that the only significant difference between the model and the envisioned reality may be a weaker discontinuity in the model between the outflowing wave from the original ionization of the cloud and the infalling gas from the periphery .",
    "but the relatively mild difference between fixed halo , and grown halo evolution suggests that a thoroughly accurate treatment of this problem would present a final profile much like the grown halos .",
    "results for some of the halos are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - g - ng ] , where the solid density profiles represent the `` grown '' halos , and the accompanying dashed lines represent fixed halos of the same circular velocity .",

    ", clouds with central bin velocities up to @xmath372 were generated with no central baryon collapse , three more velocity bins than with fixed halos .",
    "for still larger halos , however , the innermost bins collapse , indicating the plausible formation of stars .",
    "the bin with center 37.6  collapsed at very low redshift , indicating the possibility of very young void galaxies forming from such clouds .",
    "thus , the growth of void clouds could explain the existence of blue compact galaxies at voids edges @xcite , with halo circular velocities @xmath373 .    for a given normalization @xmath374 , extending the halos to larger circular velocities in this way results in a larger line density at a given column density .",
    "as a result , the best fit to the observed cds requires lowering the normalization to @xmath375 . the resulting cds , using the grown halos with hvdf slope parameter @xmath376 , is presented in fig .

    "the direction of the inequality in the equation stems from the fact that @xmath407 is an upper limit for bulk motions in these absorbers .",
    "the lower limit is the thermal @xmath183-value ; @xmath408 . for the larger cloud , @xmath409 , where the turbulent ( virial ) motions of the cloud have not been included since",
    "only the outer cloud is probed .",
    "this velocity is a lower limit because some turbulent motions are likely .",
    "larger clouds , such as @xmath410  ( @xmath411 m ) , have averaged temperatures on order @xmath412 k ( @xmath413 ) , produced by halos of velocity @xmath414 .",
    "they give total @xmath183-values @xmath415 to @xmath416 , where i have ignored the cloud expansion broadening , which is dwarfed by possible turbulent motions .",
    "the impact parameters for these systems , @xmath417 , may probe virializing regions .",
    "these values agree well with the range of @xmath183-values presented in @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "6@xmath383 ) .    in comparing the analysis of @xmath183-values in @xcite to those in this paper , it is interesting to note that though the former predict higher temperatures for a given gas density ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - lagr - hui ] ) , the thermal @xmath183-values as a function of a given column density ( eq . [ eq - temp ] ) are smaller .",
    "table 1 shows a compilation of thermal @xmath183-values ; column 1 is the log column density ; the next column shows the @xcite thermal @xmath183-values ; third are those of the present study .",
    "it would appear that at the same column density , the former must have substantially lower densities ( by a factor of @xmath418 to 5 ) than the discrete clouds considered here , and therefore have proportionately larger integration paths .",
    "the irony should not be missed ; the absorbers of @xcite are supposed to occupy a dense environment , but are less dense than the void absorbers modeled in the present effort .",
    "ccc @xmath419 ( ) & @xmath420 ( ) & @xmath420 ( ) + & @xcite & manning + 12.5 & 9.2 & 11.3 + 13.0 & 11.7 & 13.8 + 13.5 & 14.9 & 16.7 + 14.0 & 19.0 & 21.1 +    i have shown that centrally condensed clouds based on sub - galactic halos produce doppler parameter distributions consistent with observed clouds @xcite .",
    "perhaps , however , good agreement is _ not _ expected since @xcite purport to study predominantly non - void clouds , while the present study models void clouds . on the other hand ,",
    "if the lines of sight covered in their paper are like those in @xcite , then fig .",
    "[ fig - tdnrx ] would indicate that most clouds , especially those of lower column density , are in fact void clouds , and substantial agreement with the echelle observations would be expected .",
    "however , it is unlikely that one could decide between giant sheets and discrete , sub - galactic absorbers on the basis of doppler parameters alone .",
    "the conclusion to be taken away from this section is that discrete halos produce results that are consistent with observations of resolved doppler parameters in low - redshift  clouds .",
    "in the introduction , two possibly problematic aspects of recent n - body / hydro simulations were noted ; first , the fact that absorbers are expected to be produced in diffuse clouds by a `` fluctuating gunn peterson '' effect @xcite , rather than by absorption in discrete halos .",
    "second , that low - redshift absorbers are expected in diffuse filamentary structures surrounding galaxy concentrations , but not in voids .",
    "the analysis in ",
    "[ sec - dave ] showed that indeed , diffuse structures could not provide an explanation for the void absorbers .",
    "the analysis in the balance of the paper showed that discrete halos may restrain the baryons from evaporating to a degree sufficient for absorption systems to be produced that are consistent with observations .",
    "this implies that it is _ not _ a good approximation to assume that small halos would not retain a significant quantity of their baryons following reionization .",
    "however , the problem goes farther than just contesting the n - body  cloud simulations . for the current halo paradigm , nfw",
    ", also fails to explain the absorbers since those halos small enough to escape star formation are not massive enough to hold baryons against photo - evaporation . in short ,",
    "a more massive halo is needed .",
    "i have shown that an isothermal halo _ can _ explain the absorbers , within the cosmological parameters investigated here .",
    "some might argue that the isot halo is not physically realistic since they can not be virialized .",
    "however , i am not proposing that `` isot halos '' are totally virialized .",
    "instead , i propose ( as noted in  [ sec - nature - init ] ) that the isothermal density profile is a fair description only of the total mass distribution .",
    "the nfw halo is said to be universal , but when applied to rich galaxy clusters , it fails to explain the mass distribution ; analysis of galaxy - galaxy correlations by @xcite showed that the distribution of galaxies ( @xmath421 ) around rich clusters extends to @xmath422 mpc , without a feature that would suggest the expected sharp decline in density beyond @xmath423 ( @xmath424 mpc ) , or at the virial radius ( @xmath80 mpc ) .",
    "recent results of @xcite substantiate this claim using isolated groups of galaxies .",
    "they find @xmath425 , and a los velocity dispersion @xmath155 that shows no significant variation between apertures of 133 to @xmath426 ( whereas @xmath427 ) .",
    "these results appear to support an isothermal mass distribution  either truncated at a very large radius , or untruncated",
    ".    evolved isot baryon profiles whose halos were assumed to be un - evolving , were found to be more compact , and tended to form stars at velocities @xmath428 , leaving a gap between the largest model clouds and smallest galaxies and chvcs .",
    "`` grown '' halos , however , allowed clouds with circular velocities up to @xmath429  without forming stars , virtually closing the gap between model clouds and observed galaxies .",
    "the profiles which result from a gradually growing halo produce a significantly better match to the shape of the cds , though the excess at low ew does , and should remain because the sub - halos are still there affecting the cloud cross section to absorption at low column density ( though their effects can not be modeled with a 1-d simulation ) .",
    "i make the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "n - body / hydro simulations fail to predict the observed void clouds ; diffuse sheets can not explain the absorbers .",
    "the nfw halo must be rejected as an absorber model on a similar basis ; it can not explain the observed void clouds if `` nfw '' is taken to adequately represent the mass distribution _ beyond _ the virial radius .",
    "3 .   a halo more massive than nfw is needed to explain observations .",
    "i find that a model consistent with a non - singular inverse square dm density profile , with a large truncation radius , is consistent with the data .",
