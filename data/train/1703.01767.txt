    "it is now recognized that quantum computing holds the promise of a new technological revolution .",
    "for instance , it will enable to solve efficiently complex optimization problems or to simulate efficiently many - body quantum systems to understand new phases of matter or even biological systems .",
    "a wealth of applications in the fields of artificial intelligence and secure communications are also foreseen .",
    "the task to build a quantum computer is , however , a considerable one .",
    "different paradigms have been proposed to build a universal quantum computer  @xcite , such as cluster - state  @xcite or gate - based quantum computers  @xcite .",
    "the latter are composed of a qubit register on which logic gates are applied .",
    "any unitary operator acting on the register can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy by a sequence of operations from a set of universal quantum gates composed of single - qubit operations and a two - qubit entangling gate  @xcite .",
    "although there is always a non - zero probability of error per gate , quantum error correction and fault - tolerant quantum computation open the door to accurate and arbitrarily long quantum computations , provided the error produced by single- and two - qubit gates does not exceed a certain threshold  @xcite .",
    "high - fidelity quantum gates are thus a major ingredient for scalable quantum computing .",
    "several platforms implementing a universal gate - based quantum computer have been proposed ( see e.g.  @xcite for reviews ) , which include neutral atoms  @xcite , photons  @xcite , trapped ions  @xcite and superconducting circuits  @xcite .",
    "cold neutral atoms in optical or magnetic lattices represent a very promising platform due to the long coherence time of the qubits encoded in zeeman or hyperfine ground states , the possibility to address atoms individually  @xcite and the ability to produce large arrays of qubits  @xcite .",
    "recently , high fidelity single - qubit gates using microwave fields have been reported in a 2d array of cesium atoms  @xcite .",
    "different schemes implementing two - qubit entangling gates on neutral atoms have been proposed  @xcite , one of which relies on the dipole blockade  @xcite . by taking advantage of the strong dipole - dipole interactions between atoms in rydberg states  @xcite , it is possible to prevent any modifications of the target s atom state conditionally on the control s atom state . this concept has been demonstrated experimentally with the implementations of two - qubit controlled - not ( cnot )  @xcite and controlled - phase gates  @xcite .",
    "note that interactions between atoms in rydberg states also allows to implement , in principle , quantum gates involving more than two qubits  @xcite .",
    "most of the protocols for the implementation of two - qubit gates proposed so far operate between atoms that are on adjacent lattice sites . however , in a large array of qubits , it is highly desirable to be able to perform entangling gates between arbitrarily far apart atoms in the lattice .",
    "a few proposals addressing this problem have been made  @xcite .",
    "one idea put forward is to use a spin chain as a quantum bus to perform quantum gates between distant qubits  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the adiabatic following of the ground state of the spin chain across the paramagnet to crystal phase transition .",
    "another proposal is to use moving carrier atoms of a different species while mediating the quantum gate with molecular states  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested to transport the state of the control qubit near the target qubit via optical lattice modulations  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we propose to use a chain of ancillary non - coding atoms to implement two - qubit entangling gates between atoms arbitrarily far apart in the lattice .",
    "the ancillary atoms are used as mediators to connect control and target atoms .",
    "rydberg excitation hopping along the chain of ancillary atoms enables to modify the state of the target atom conditionally on the state of the control atom via rydberg blockade . as such",
    ", our protocol can be seen as a generalisation of the one of jaksch _ et al . _",
    "@xcite to the case where the qubits are spatially separated .",
    "more specifically , we present protocols that implement either a cnot gate or a modified control - z ( cz ) gate , represented in the computational basis by the unitary matrices  @xcite @xmath0    this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ system ] , the system and the master equation describing its time evolution are presented .",
    "the section also contains a reminder on the process fidelity used to assess the performance of our protocols in the presence of errors .",
    "section  [ protocol ] is devoted to the description of the protocol implementing two - qubit entangling gates between atoms arbitrarily far apart in the lattice . in section  [ results ] , we present and discuss our results on the effects of dissipation and imperfect blockade on the gates fidelity and compare , in terms of performance , our protocol with implementations using only nearest neighbours two - qubit gates .",
    "section  [ perspective ] discusses some experimental considerations and gives perspectives of our work . a conclusion ( section  [ conclusion ] ) ends this paper",
    "the physical system that we consider is a 1d chain of coding atoms ( qubit atoms , labeled q ) next to a shifted parallel chain of non - coding atoms ( ancillary atoms , labeled a ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "this system could be implemented e.g.  by loading an optical lattice with different atomic species  @xcite .",
    "the protocol that we present in sec  [ protocol ] also works for 2d or 3d lattices . here , we consider a 1d lattice merely for computational convenience .",
    "the control ( c ) and target ( t ) qubits are connected via a chain of @xmath1 ancillary atoms , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig2](a ) .",
    "each atom , either qubit or ancillary , is assumed to be individually addressable by laser pulses .",
    "qubit atoms are modelled by three - level systems in a @xmath2 configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) , where the two lower states @xmath3 and @xmath4 encode the qubit and the upper rydberg state @xmath5 allows for dipole - dipole interaction with either ancillary or qubit atoms .",

    "any two neighbouring atoms , either qubit or ancillary , strongly interact via dipole - dipole interactions as soon as one of them is in a rydberg state . in the strong interaction regime",
    ", this leads to an effective energy shift of the doubly excited state , either @xmath23 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) depending on the pair of interacting atoms .",
    "when this energy shift is much larger than the atom - laser interaction energy , only one atom can be excited at a time to the rydberg state and the system is said to exhibit dipole or rydberg blockade  @xcite . note that this phenomenom can also occur between atoms of different species  @xcite . in order to model rydberg blockade in our system , we add to the system hamiltonian terms accounting for the energy shifts of the doubly excited states : @xmath27 for the interaction between control and target qubit atoms , @xmath28 with @xmath29 for the interaction between ancillary atoms @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ( @xmath26 ) for the interaction between qubit and ancillary atoms .",

    "the next - nearest neighbours energy shifts are also taken into account assuming a resonant dipole - dipole interaction between atoms in rydberg states  @xcite .",
    "spontaneous desexcitation of the rydberg states to lower energy states is one of the major sources of error in the implementation of quantum gates relying on the dipole blockade mechanism . in our system",
    ", we consider that the qubit atoms can decay from the rydberg state @xmath36 to the states @xmath37 and @xmath38 with decay rates @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , whereas the ancillary atoms can decay from the rydberg state @xmath17 to the state @xmath16 with decay rate @xmath41 .    in order to take this source of dissipation into account , we solve a master equation for the density operator @xmath42 describing the global state of the control , target and @xmath1 ancillary atoms .",
    "its standard form reads @xmath43\\\\ & + \\sum_{\\mathrm{q}=\\c,\\t}\\sum_{k=0,1}{\\left(\\hat{l}_k^{\\mathrm{q}}\\hat{\\rho}(t ) ( \\hat{l}_k^{\\mathrm{q}})^\\dagger -\\frac{1}{2 } \\left\\{(\\hat{l}_k^{\\mathrm{q}})^\\dagger \\hat{l}_k^{\\mathrm{q } } , \\hat{\\rho}(t)\\right\\}\\right)}\\\\ & + \\sum_{j=1}^{n_{\\a}}\\left(\\hat{l}_{\\a}^j\\hat{\\rho}(t ) ( \\hat{l}_{\\a}^j)^\\dagger -\\frac{1}{2 } \\left\\{(\\hat{l}_{\\a}^j)^\\dagger \\hat{l}_{\\a}^j,\\hat{\\rho}(t)\\right\\}\\right ) , \\end{aligned } \\label{linblad}\\ ] ] with the jump operators @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce the total decay rate for the qubit atoms , @xmath47 .      in order to assess the performance of our protocols implementing cnot and cz gates against sources of error",
    ", we compute the process fidelity @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "the process fidelity measures the difference between an ideal and real quantum processes .",
    "for an ideal unitary quantum process @xmath49 , the process fidelity between @xmath49 and the real process specified by its complete positive map @xmath50 takes the simple form  @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a basis for operators acting on a @xmath53-dimensional hilbert space that verifies the orthonormalization condition @xmath54 .",
    "the process fidelity thus corresponds to the overlap between an operator @xmath55 evolved with the ideal process and the same operator evolved with the real process , averaged over all basis operators @xmath55 . it is related to the average fidelity @xmath56 which quantifies the uniform average over the whole hilbert space of the overlap between @xmath57 and @xmath58 through  @xcite @xmath59 the computation of the process fidelity involves the propagation of @xmath60 operators under the process @xmath61 , which rapidly becomes intractable as @xmath53 increases",
    "however , lower and upper bounds of the process fidelity can be computed much faster using only two complementary basis of pure states  @xcite . consider a basis of @xmath53 pure states @xmath62 and the complementary basis @xmath63 defined as @xmath64 introducing the classical fidelity of the process in a basis @xmath65 of the @xmath53-dimensional hilbert space by @xmath66 the following inequalities hold  @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the classical fidelities computed respectively in the bases @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the expression @xmath72 is referred to as the hofmann bound on process fidelity . for these bounds to be computed , it suffices to propagate @xmath73 pure states instead of @xmath60 operators .",
    "as in many other situations in implentations of quantum computating devices , the system of interest is composed not only of the qubits but also includes ancillary subsystems or non - coding sublevels needed in order to implement quantum gates .",
    "as these ancillary systems or levels are generally in well - defined states before and after the gate operation , computing the fidelity on the whole hilbert space may lead to over - pessimistic error estimation . in order to avoid this problem ,",
    "the process fidelity can be computed using only a basis of the relevant qubits subspace  @xcite . in the case of our distant qubits gate protocol ,",
    "the relevant subspace is spanned by the four states encoding the control and target qubits , whereas all non - coding ancillary atoms are in their ground state .",
    "therefore , the process fidelity will be computed for this subspace of dimension @xmath74 only .",
    "our protocol is a generalization of the one proposed in  @xcite for the implementation of a two - qubit quantum gate to the case where the qubits are spatially separated as encountered in arrays of qubits encoded in the internal state of neutral atoms trapped in an optical lattice .",
    "the basic idea of our proposal is to use a chain of ancillary atoms to transfer the rydberg excitation that the control atom may carry , depending on its initial state , near the target atom .",
    "this can again be performed by using the rydberg blockade .",
    "more specifically , we consider the case in which control and target qubits are separated by @xmath75 ancillary non - coding atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the ancillary atoms are initially prepared in their ground state @xmath16 and that we operate in the strong blockade regime ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the generic pulse sequence implementing a given transformation on the target qubit conditionally on the state of the control qubit is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .        during the protocol",
    ", the transition of the control atom that is to be driven depends both on the length @xmath75 of the chain of ancillary atoms and the particular two - qubit gate that is to be implemented ( in this work either cnot or modified cz ) . the first part of the pulse sequence goes as follows : a first @xmath77-pulse is applied to the control atom and drives only the transition from one of the ground state ( either @xmath78 or @xmath79 ) to the rydberg state @xmath80 .",
    "it is followed by a @xmath77-pulse acting on the first ancillary atom @xmath81 . due to the rydberg blockade",
    ", if the control atom is in @xmath80 , then @xmath81 stays in the ground state @xmath82 , while if the control atom is in the ground state manifold , then @xmath81 gets exited to the rydberg state @xmath83 .",
    "then , a second @xmath77-pulse is applied on the control atom that brings it back to its initial state .",
    "after these three pulses , the first ancillary atom is in its ground state @xmath82 only if the control atom was excited to its rydberg state @xmath80 .",
    "next , two @xmath77-pulses are successively applied to the second and the first ancillary atoms @xmath84 and @xmath81 .",
    "the first one excites @xmath84 to its rydberg state @xmath85 only if @xmath81 is in @xmath82 .",
    "the second pulse brings back @xmath81 to its initial state .",
    "note that if @xmath81 is initially in @xmath82 , then the rydberg blockade due to atom @xmath84 prevents unwanted excitation of @xmath81 . at this stage of the protocol ,",
    "the ancillary atom @xmath84 is in the rydberg state @xmath85 only if the control atom was driven to @xmath80 by the very first pulse of the sequence . the same pattern that consists of successive @xmath77-pulses on @xmath86 and @xmath87",
    "is applied sequentially to each pair of ancillary atoms , i.e.  for @xmath88 .",
    "the effect of the pulse sequence above is to produce a hopping of the rydberg excitation from one atom to the next nearest - neighbour atom all along the chain separating control and target qubits ( see red path in fig  [ fig2]a ) . more precisely , if the first @xmath77-pulse of the protocol excites the control atom to its rydberg state @xmath89 , then the ancillary atoms @xmath87 with even @xmath30 go through their rydberg state during the protocol while those with odd @xmath30 always stay in the ground state .",
    "conversely , if the control atom is unaffected by the first pulse , i.e.  if it remains in the ground state manifold , then the ancillary atoms @xmath87 with odd @xmath30 go through their rydberg state during the protocol while those with even @xmath30 always stay in the ground state .",
    "after this first part of the pulse sequence , a suitable transformation @xmath90 is applied to the target atom that implements the desired conditional gate .",
    "the implementation , which should obviously rely on the dipole blockade mechanism , is shown at the bottom of fig .  2 in the cases of cz and cnot gates .",
    "note that the transition of the control atom to be driven should be chosen in accordance with the parity of the length @xmath91 of the chain of ancillary atoms .",
    "finally , in order to bring back the ancillary atoms to their initial state , the same pulses as in the first part of the sequence are applied , however this time in reverse order .    during the execution of our protocol , at most one atom at a time",
    "is in a rydberg state and the rydberg excitation thus stays localised on a single atom .",
    "the number of @xmath77-pulses required in our protocol to implement a long - distance quantum gate is @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the number of @xmath77-pulses applied on the target atom .",
    "each @xmath77 pulse either leads to no phase shift when the transition is prevented by the dipole blockade mechanism or to a @xmath94 phase shift when the transition is driven resonantly .",
    "all atoms , except @xmath95 and target atoms , are submitted to four @xmath77-pulses which altogether do not produce any phase shift .",
    "thus , the accumulated phase of the global state only comes from the pulses on @xmath95 and on the target atom .",
    "if @xmath95 is excited to its rydberg state during the sequence , then it produces a phase shift of @xmath77 .    this generic pulse sequence can be tailored in order to implement either a modified cz - gate or a cnot gate ( as in eq .  ) .",
    "let us first consider the case of the modified cz - gate with an even number of ancillary atoms @xmath96 . in that case , the control atom is submitted to ( four ) pulses driving the transition @xmath97 and the target atom is submitted to a @xmath98-pulse driving the transition @xmath99 . when the control atom is in @xmath79 , the last ancillary atom @xmath100 is excited to the rydberg state @xmath101 , which produces a @xmath77 phase - shift while the dipole blockade prevents the excitation of the target atom .",
    "when the control atom is in @xmath78 , the last ancillary atom stays in the ground state and the pulse on the target atom produces a @xmath77 phase - shift only if the target atom is in @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , the only state producing no phase - shift is @xmath103 and the pulse sequence implements the modified cz gate   between two qubits that can be arbitrarily far apart in the lattice . as an illustration , the state of the global system at each stage of the pulse sequence for different input states is given in table  [ tab1 ] of appendix a in the case @xmath104 .",
    "for an odd number @xmath105 of ancillary atoms , the protocol needs to be slightly amended . in that case",
    ", when the control atom is in @xmath79 , it should not be driven to the rydberg state by the pulses applied on it , so that the last ancillary atom @xmath106 gets excited to the rydberg state . therefore , driving the transition @xmath107 leads to the desired modified cz gate  . again , as an illustration , the state of the global system at each stage of the pulse sequence for different input states is given in table  [ tab2 ] of appendix a in the case @xmath108 .",
    "a potential alternative for implementing the modified cz gate with an odd number of ancillary atoms consists of applying a @xmath109 transformation on the control qubit right before and after the protocol shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where the pulses on the control atom drive the transition @xmath110 as was the case for an even number of ancillary atoms .",
    "this operation amounts to swap the role of the states @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which eventually leads to the desired situation where @xmath106 is in the rydberg state @xmath111 if the control atom is initially in @xmath79 and @xmath106 is in @xmath112 if the control atom is initially in @xmath78 .",
    "an advantage of this alternative protocol is that , independently of the number of ancillary atoms , only the @xmath110 transition of the control atoms has to be driven .",
    "this simplifies the experimental implementation , at the cost of performing two additional single - qubit gates on the control qubit .",
    "the effects of this pulse sequence on the different two - qubit input states is given in table  [ tab3 ] of appendix a.    as explained previously , the modified cz gate can be turned into a cnot gate using only single - qubit operations  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it might be useful to directly perform a cnot gate , which consists of swapping the internal state of the target qubit when the control atom is in @xmath79 .",
    "this can be achieved by applying three @xmath77-pulses on the target atom driving successively the transitions @xmath113 , @xmath99 and @xmath113 . in the absence of rydberg excitation near the target atom that would induce rydberg blockade , this sequence of three pulses swaps the coding state of the target atom .",
    "note that independently of the state of the target atom , only two pulses out of three effectively affect the target atom .",
    "therefore this operation on the target atom leads to a @xmath77 phase shift . in order to ensure that the swap operation is performed",
    "only if the control atom is in @xmath79 , the transition @xmath114 ( @xmath110 ) must be driven on the control atom if the number of ancillary atom is even ( odd ) .",
    "the resulting protocol implements a cnot gate up to a global phase factor of @xmath115 .",

    "thus , by averaging over all possible initial states , we obtain @xmath173 as for the ancillary atoms , they are each submitted to four @xmath77-pulses except for the last one which is only submitted to two @xmath77-pulses . only half of these pulses bring the ancillary atoms to their rydberg state , in which they spend in total the duration of four @xmath77-pulses .",

    ", dissipation acts only when the atoms are evolving freely in their rydberg state or during the pulses that drive qubit or ancillary atoms into their rydberg states and thus the process fidelity of the cnot gate is determined by the cumulated time spent by the atoms in the rydberg states . a similar counting argument as for the modified cz gate can be made , which leads to an approximation of the form of eq .",

    "[ fig2 ] where the two chains of atoms are displaced , performing our distant qubits protocol for @xmath1 ancillary atoms corresponds for the control and target qubits to be separated by @xmath179 other qubits .",
    "an obvious advantage of our protocol is that only the two qubits involved in the gate are manipulated and thus prone to errors ( we remind that ancillary atoms are non - coding ) . in contrast , for a sequence of nearest neighbours cnot gates , all the qubits in - between the control and target qubits are submitted to quantum gates and thus potentially prone to errors .    the number of pulses needed to perform a distant qubits cnot gate with @xmath1 ancillary atoms , given in eq .  , is @xmath180 .",

    "our protocol always leads to a higher fidelity .",
    "a simple estimate of the gain in fidelity can be made in the case of low dissipation rates following a similar reasoning as in the previous subsections . for strong blockade and identical decay rates on qubit and ancillary atoms ( @xmath187 and @xmath186 ) , the ratio of process fidelities is approximately given by @xmath188 where @xmath48 , resp .",

    "also , we could consider an intermediary level between the ground - state manifold and the rydberg state of the qubit atoms as the laser excitation to the rydberg state is usually a two - stage process . a more rigorous description of the dipole - dipole interaction between atoms leading to the rydberg blockade could also be considered .",
    "however , such simulations are much more demanding in terms of resources .    for simplicity ,",
    "only square pulses have been considered in this work . from an experimental perspective",
    ", it is certainly relevant to investigate the implementation of our protocol using gaussian pulses or optimized pulses  @xcite , allowing to further increase the process fidelity . in order to experimentaly implement our protocol",
    ", one could use the same species for both qubit and ancillary atoms .",
    "in such a configuration , the position of the atoms in the different traps or in the lattice will determine its role ( coding or non - coding ) in the protocol .",
    "this solution could be implemented with rubidium atoms  @xcite in dipole traps or using two - dimensional arrays of cesium atoms  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to rely on two different atomic species to implement the qubits and the chain of ancillary non - coding atoms . in this case",
    ", suitable rydberg states need to be identified that allow for strong dipole blockade between qubit and ancillary atoms , and in - between ancillary atoms . a good candidate for the implementation of our protocol",

    "we have proposed a protocol for the implementation of two - qubit entangling gates ( cz , cnot ) between any pairs of qubits in the array that relies on the rydberg excitation hopping along a chain of ancillary non - coding atoms in the strong blockade regime .",
    "the hopping of the rydberg excitation from one atom to its next nearest neighbour is produced by an appropriate pulse sequence that ensures that at most one atom at a time in the entire system is in a rydberg state .",
    "we have solved a master equation for up to 9 ancillary atoms in order to evaluate the process fidelity characterizing the performance of our protocols in the presence of dissipation .",
    "we have found that the process fidelity is determined by the cumulated time spent by the atoms in the decaying rydberg states during the execution of the protocols .",
    "the design of our protocol ensures that this time scales linearly with the number of ancillary atoms .",
    "moreover , we have shown that our protocols for entangling gates between distant qubits lead to better process fidelities than those based on a sequence of nearest neighbours two - qubit gates , even when the qubits are separated by a few other atoms .",
