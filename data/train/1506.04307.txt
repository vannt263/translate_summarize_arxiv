    "then , as in the unit square case , one partitions @xmath58 into @xmath217 vertical strips of equal area",
    "( thus each vertical strip is bounded by two vertical segments and by two pieces of the boundary of @xmath58 ) .",
    "all the arguments from the unit square carry over so far to this case : the estimates for the number of empty strips and the probability that two of them are consecutive are the same .",
    "the only technical complication arises when one needs to do the equivalent step of choosing points @xmath255 and @xmath245 with large @xmath241-coordinates ( and points @xmath256 and @xmath257 with small @xmath241-coordinates ) : in this general case , one needs to define , for each empty strip , small regions at the top and at the bottom of its neighboring strips ( each of these small regions must have area @xmath258 , as in the unit square case ) .",
    "taking care rigorously of the details is of course not a deep difficulty ( here is where the smoothness of the boundary of @xmath58 comes handy ) , but the simplicity of the basic ideas seems much more apparent by focusing on the unit square case .",
    "we conjecture that in both theorems  [ thm : maintheorem2 ] and  [ thm : maintheorem3 ] the upper bounds should match the lower bounds @xmath259 , as in theorem  [ thm : maintheorem1 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that in none of the main theorems we make full use of the convexity assumption for @xmath1 and @xmath5 . actually , all these results hold as long as @xmath1 is ( for instance ) a finite union of convex sets . the convexity of @xmath5 is only required so that we can invoke proposition  [ prop : lassak ] , but for any fixed ( not necessarily convex ) bounded @xmath5 one can obviously find inscribed and circumscribed rectangles that approximate its area within constant factors .",
    "thus the proofs of the main theorems can be adapted to prove the following :    [ thm : general ] let @xmath0 be sets in the plane , where @xmath1 is the finite union of convex sets and @xmath5 is bounded .",
    "suppose for normalization purposes that the area of @xmath1 is @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a set of @xmath4 points chosen independently and uniformly at random from @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the random variable that measures the largest ( in terms of area ) hole that is homothetic to @xmath5 ; let @xmath12 denote the random variable that measures the largest ( in terms of area ) convex hole ; and let @xmath14 denote the random variable that measures the largest ( in terms of area ) convex polygon with vertices in @xmath3",
    ". then w.h.p .",
    "@xmath260    we also note that all these results and their proofs carry over easily to the @xmath16-dimensional case , although the multiplicative constants one obtains depend on @xmath16 .",
