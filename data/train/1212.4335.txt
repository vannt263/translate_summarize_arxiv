    "polymer nanocomposites ( pncs ) are made by dispersing nanoparticles ( nps ) into polymer matrices .",
    "pncs are currently a subject of intense research efforts , as their applications range from the automotive industry to advanced coatings ( for a review , see paul@xcite )",
    ". pncs often exhibit enhanced physical properties as compared to pure polymer materials @xcite .",
    "these enhanced properties arise even at small np loadings and have been exploited at the industrial level for many years already@xcite .",
    "nanoparticles dispersed in polymer matrices , also called nanofillers , can significantly influence the rheological @xcite , optical @xcite , electrical @xcite , thermal @xcite and mechanical @xcite properties of the material .",
    "many parameters may play a role in the reinforcement of the polymer matrix : nanoparticle shape and size , loading and dispersion in the polymer matrix , interaction type and strength between the monomers and the nanoparticles , nanoparticle mobility , temperature , entanglement of the polymers and degree of polymerization .",
    "furthermore , these parameters are often mutually dependent making it difficult to unravel the influence of any single agent .",
    "+ in the last decade , several computational works dealing with the modeling of polymer nanocomposites , at an atomistic or coarse - grained level , have appeared@xcite . concerning the nanofiller size and shape ,",
    "computational studies have focused on fillers whose size is comparable to the characteristic length scales of the polymer matrix , namely the radius of gyration of the polymers or the size of their monomers @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations performed in the regime of optimal np dispersion and strong polymer - np interactions @xcite have shown that the smaller nps have better reinforcing properties , leading to tougher pncs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the increase in the aspect ratio of the nanoparticles , that finds an experimental correspondence in carbon nanotubes @xcite or clay sheets @xcite , have been observed to lead to an increase of the mechanical reinforcement of pnc @xcite .",
    "+ open questions nevertheless remain in explaining the microscopic reinforcing mechanisms .",
    "the improved mechanical properties have been explained by either dynamical or structural properties of the pnc .",
    "the dynamical arguments are based on the observation that a pnc , where nps are more mobile than the polymer chains , achieves a better resistance against deformation via improved release of local tension @xcite .",
    "the structural arguments relate the nps ability to create temporary bonds between the chains , thus creating a np - polymer network , to the mechanical properties of the pnc @xcite . in a recent publication @xcite we demonstrated that the mechanical properties of pnc loaded with small , spherical nps are related to structural features , such as the filler loading , the surface area of the polymer - filler interface and the polymer - filler network structure .",
    "we showed as well that these structural features are correlated to the minimization of the relative mobility of the fillers with respect to the polymer matrix .",
    "+ in this paper we extend on our previous work on the mechanical properties of pncs under strain @xcite .",
    "we use molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of pncs doped with spherical , triangular , and rod - like nps of various sizes and at different loadings .",
    "we simulate the stretching of a pnc grafted to two opposite sticky walls that are pulled apart during the tensile test , in a similar fashion to what was previously done by gersappe @xcite .",
    "we thus measure the tensile stress under strain to quantify the toughness of the pnc at a temperature higher than its glass transition temperature @xmath0 .",
    "we study the origins of the reinforcement by analyzing the structural properties of the pnc .",
    "we thus aim at answering two key questions : how do filler size , geometry and loading change the toughness of the pncs and what are the structural molecular mechanisms leading to toughening ? + in section [ sec : model ] we present the model and the set - up of our simulations . section [ sec : results ] illustrates the results of our simulations , which are further analyzed in the section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "a discussion of the results , including comparison to experimental and previous computational data , is presented in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we study pncs that contain @xmath1 linear polymer chains , each made of @xmath1 identical monomers , and a variable number of nps .",
    "the nanoparticles are either spherical , triangular or rod - like .",
    "the systems are periodic along the @xmath2 and @xmath3 directions and confined between two sticky walls in the @xmath4 direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot ] .",
    "+        in this section we introduce all the interaction potentials between the polymer beads , the nanoparticles and the walls .",
    "table [ tab : potentialpar ] shows the numerical values for all the relevant physical parameters here .",
    ".potential parameters .",
    "energy units for @xmath5 are ev and units of length for @xmath6 and @xmath7 are  .",
    "force constants are expressed in ev /  . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the results presented so far point at a general effect of reinforcement induced by the addition of spherical nanoparticles to the polymer matrix .",
    "we now focus on the loading dependence of the stress at failure , aiming at identifying the loading range corresponding to the better reinforcement effect . + we consider six different loadings for medium size nanoparticles for the tensile tests . fig . [",
    "fig : loading compare mf ] shows the value of the stress at failure as a function of loading .",
    "the 42% loading gives the highest stress at failure and the optimal loading range is located between 25% and 50% .",
    "+          we now compare pncs containing spherical , triangular and rod - like nanoparticles .",
    "the triangular and rod - like nps are both made of three connected medium size spherical nanoparticles ( as described in section [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "the spherical nanoparticles have a mass @xmath8 and the same density as the medium size spherical nanoparticles , thus leading to @xmath9{3}\\sigma_m$ ] .",
    "+ the results at 15% loading for the above systems are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape comparison 15 ] .",
    "the results indicate that the rod - like nps offer the best reinforcement , followed by the triangles and the spherical nanoparticles .",
    "however , as the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : shape comparison 15 ] shows , we see almost no difference between the rod - like and the triangular nps at 27% loading .",
    "furthermore , the stress - strain curve of the triangular particle pnc in the elastic regime at 15% loading is steeper than the corresponding part in the other systems curves , indicating a more brittle behaviour .        at both 15% and 27% loadings",
    "the rod - like nps emerge as the best pnc toughening agent .",
    "thus we investigate how the rod length changes the stress - strain behavior of the pnc while keeping the loading constant .",
    "we choose 27% loading and rod lengths of @xmath10 and @xmath11 beads .",
    "our results , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stick compare ] , show that there is no significant difference in the stress at failure between rod lengths of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while a decrease of the mechanical performance is observed for rod length of @xmath11 that in terms of stress at failure performs similarly to the case of a pnc containing a 27% loading of medium - sized spherical nps . on the other hand ,",
    "the long rods offer a better resistance to cavity growth . compared to spherical nps , all rod - like nps yield a higher elastic modulus that shifts the yield strain from @xmath14 ( medium spherical nps ) down to @xmath15",
    "in this section we try to gain more insight into the reinforcement mechanisms by studying structural properties of our pncs . in our systems , the np - monomer interactions are strong and contribute to the formation of temporary crosslinks in the polymer matrix , which counterbalance the increase of voids in the matrix .",
    "we thus monitored the void formation and the number of monomer - monomer , monomer - np and np - np contacts during the equilibration and the tensile tests .",
    "concerning the voids formation , we divided our simulation box into cubes with edges of 10  , and considered a cube to be void if there was no particle of any type inside them .",
    "two void cubes were considered to belong to the same void cluster if they shared a face . concerning the definition of contacts between beads , we considered two beads to be in contact if the distance between the beads was less than @xmath16 times the equilibrium distance of the corresponding interaction potential .",
    "we excluded the intra - chain and intra - np contacts from our calculations .    during pulling ,",
    "the elastic regime is characterized by a homogeneous decrease of density .",
    "voids , as shown in the center snapshot of fig .",
    "[ fig : voids ] , are distributed uniformly into the simulation box .",
    "shortly after the pnc is starting to fail , almost all the voids collapse into the same individual cluster and the density of the melt relaxes towards its equilibrium value , while the cluster size increases linearly .",
    "figure [ fig : contacts ] shows the number of all contacts ( sum of the monomer - monomer , np - monomer and np - np contacts ) and the fraction of np - monomer contacts as a function of time for system s4 , as described in table [ tab : systems ] . during the elastic stage of the deformation , the total number of contacts decreases .",
    "however , the fraction of np - monomer contacts increases , at the expenses of the weaker monomer - monomer and np - np contacts .",
    "this trend is common to all the pncs studied in this work",
    ". +            [ [ temporary - crosslinks . ] ] temporary crosslinks .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the strong np - polymer contacts are at least partly responsible for the reinforcement properties of the pnc .",
    "network structure is expected to play a role , too .",
    "we thus look for crosslinks by enumerating the number of np - chain contacts in the systems .",
    "a crosslink is different from a contact , as multiple contacts between the same polymer chain and a np will be considered as a single crosslinking event .",
    "the average number of crosslinks per particle , @xmath17 , quantifies the ability of the particle to act as a bridge between different polymer chains . to this respect ,",
    "large nanoparticles should be favored by their larger absolute surface area . as a matter of fact , in the systems",
    "s1-s6 the large particles fail in exploiting at best their individual surfaces , as it always holds that @xmath18 .",
    "we discuss the results presented in the previous section in light of previous experimental and computational data .",
    "the first general conclusion is that independently from the size or the shape of the nanoparticles , their addition to the polymer matrix lead to the formation of a composite with improved mechanical resistance as compared to the pure polymer system .",
    "this result is in agreement with many experimental findings , showing the reinforcement effects of both spherical @xcite and non - spherical inclusions @xcite .",
    "previous computational works have led to the same general conclusions , as in gersappe @xcite and papakonstantopoulos @xcite , who analyzed the toughening effects of spherical nanoparticles , toepperwein @xcite , who investigated the effects of rods , and knauert @xcite , who compared spheres , rods and platelets .",
    "working in a regime of strong polymer - filler interactions , we have shown that since the beginning of the deformation , nearest - neighbor contacts between polymers and nanoparticles resist sample stretching ( fig.[fig : contacts ] ) , thus suggesting that the np - polymer network has a major role in the deformation resistance of the pncs . in the elastic phase of the pnc under strain , while the fraction of np - polymer contacts rapidly increases , voids are distributed uniformly in the melt .",
    "as strain increases beyond yield , the pnc rupture is seen as a single large void forming in the melt , while the stress abruptly decreases and the decrease in the number of total contacts slows down .",
    "+ the above features appear to be common to all the systems analyzed here .",
    "let us next discuss how the size of the spherical fillers influences the toughness of the nanocomposite .",
    "our results indicate that small fillers - as small as the polymer monomers - are the best at toughening the composite material .",
    "this effect can be in part explained by the large total surface area of the smaller nps , when compared to larger nanoparticles at fixed loadings .",
    "but even at different loadings but with fixed surface area , the smallest nps emerge as the best toughening agents as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stressstrain1 ] .",
    "this result is robust , as demonstrated by the analogous conclusions reached by gersappe @xcite and by our previous work @xcite , despite the differences between the system set - ups ( presence or absence of sticky walls ) and simulation techniques ( tensile - test protocols ) .",
    "furthermore , the nanoparticles ability to use their surface area for temporary crosslinks , quantified here as a number of average crosslinks per np scaled by the surface area of the np , is correlated with the pnc toughness . + in the small np regime ( @xmath19 ) the mass of the np is expected to influence the np diffusion in the polymer matrix @xcite .",
    "the role of the np dynamics on the reinforcement mechanism is still debated @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that in nanocomposites loaded with different amounts of nps , the loading corresponding to the largest stress at failure also corresponds to the minimum relative mobility of the np with respect to the polymer matrix .",
    "it is more difficult to establish a correlation between the mechanical response of the material and the absolute mobility of the nps and of the polymers .",
    "our results indicate that the np mass does not have any significant effect on the stress - strain behavior of the pnc .",
    "a similar conclusion is reported by toepperwein @xcite , where the polymer dynamics is shown to be little affected by the increase in length - and thus mass - of the nps .",
    "+ figure 4 shows that the dependence of the stress at failure on loading is not monotonous . in the limit of vanishing np loading",
    ", the pnc behaves as the pure polymer matrix . as the np loading increases , the nanoparticles tend to decorate the polymer chains ( as shown in fig.8 ) .",
    "since the nanoparticle - monomer interaction is the strongest interaction in our system , the creation of np - polymer contacts results in a strengthening of the matrix . as more and more np - polymer contacts are created , the polymer surface available to the formation of new np - polymer contacts decreases .",
    "further addition of nps does not create any more strong np - polymer contacts , while the number of weak np - np contacts keeps increasing @xcite .",
    "this results in the overall weakening of the nanocomposite . +",
    "the loading dependence of the mechanical reinforcement can , in turn , depend on the type of np . in our previous publication",
    "we showed@xcite that the mechanical resistance of pncs filled with small , medium and large size nps could exhibit shifted loading dependence ( the larger the np , the larger the loading required to achieve the maximum stress at failure ) . here , the different loading dependence of triangular and rod - like nps might explain why at 15% loading the rod - like nps have better performances than the triangular nps , but at 27% loading they achieve the same result .",
    "another aspect to be taken into account when comparing nps with different shapes and loadings is the glass transition temperature of the pnc .",
    "we performed all simulations at the same temperature ( @xmath20 k ) , which is well above the glass transition temperature @xmath21 k in our systems .",
    "however , it is possible that slightly different or more clear trends could be observed by working at constant @xmath22 , as shown by toepperwein@xcite .",
    "+ in addition to the maximum stress at failure , the elastic modulus of the pnc can be tuned by tuning the np shape .",
    "figure [ fig : stick compare ] shows clearly that at 27% loading the pnc containing rod - like nps have a larger elastic modulus than those containing spherical nps . at 15%",
    "loading , even though the differences are less pronounced , the elastic modulus of the rod - like nps is higher than those of the spherical nps , while the best performance is offered by the triangular nps .",
    "furthermore , the comparison of results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape comparison 15 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : stick compare ] indicate that the increase in the loading of rod - like nps increases the elastic modulus of pnc , a fact that is in agreement with experimental results @xcite . in terms of stress at failure",
    ", our data do not suggest a dramatic influence of the aspect ratio of the nps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stick compare ] ) .",
    "a small drop in the maximum stress is seen by using the longest rod length , @xmath23 .",
    "both these features agree with what observed by toepperwein@xcite at constant @xmath22 ratio , below the glass transition temperature , even though in this case the drop of the maximum stress achieved by the pnc is observed for longer rods - like nps ( @xmath24 ) . in our calculations , the resistance against cavity growth is enhanced by increasing the rod length , again in agreement with simulations in the glassy state@xcite .",
    "+ on the whole , we can conclude that the size of the inclusions has a more pronouced effect on the mechanical properties of the pnc than the shape of the inclusions .",
    "structural features , and in particular the formation of a polymer - network able to resist to cavity growth during tensile tests , are predominant over dynamical features .",
