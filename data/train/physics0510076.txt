    "magnetic fields are powerful tools to control and manipulate the motion of neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "these fields can either be created by ( macroscopic ) coils @xcite , free standing wires @xcite or - as a result of the growing effort for miniaturization and integration - by surface - mounted micro fabricated structures , so - called atom chips @xcite . compared to macroscopic setups , atom chips provide high magnetic field gradients @xcite and therefore enable the realization of tightly confining traps .",
    "the flexibility of designing complex current and charge patterns on the chip allows for considerable freedom to engineer  potential landscapes  for neutral atoms .",
    "this has resulted in numerous designs of atom - optical elements such as traps , guides , beams splitters and interferometers @xcite with possible applications ranging from quantum information processing @xcite to high precision measurements @xcite . even though many of these designs have been demonstrated experimentally @xcite ,",
    "there have been enormous difficulties to realize a coherent beam splitter using microscopically tailored static or slowly varying fields @xcite .",
    "most of these difficulties stem from the fact that maxwell s equations constrain the freedom to design static magnetic potentials .",
    "one consequence is that the number of potential minima created is less or equal to the number of wires used @xcite .",
    "whereas regular strongly confining potential minima are created from quadrupole fields , the merging and splitting relies on higher order multipoles , usually the hexapole component , and thus results in a significantly weaker confinement .",
    "consequently any dynamic splitting of a potential passes through a weakly confining region and creates an additional unwanted minimum , a loss channel .",
    "this splitting two in two makes the central splitting region very unstable and therefore truly adiabatic manipulations are hard to perform @xcite .",
    "these deficiencies can be overcome by using not only static fields but combining them with oscillating radio frequency ( rf ) or micro - wave near fields .",
    "the adiabatic dressed state potentials created in this way do not show the unwanted loss channels , keep the confinement tight during the splitting process and consequently allow for a smooth transition from a single to two channels .",
    "well controlled coherent splitting and simultaneous tight confinement of the atomic motion can be achieved even far away from the chip surface @xcite .",
    "in addition adiabatic potentials permit the creation of non - trivial topologies like , for example , two - dimensional traps @xcite , closed path interferometers and ring geometries .",
    "also smooth transformations between different potential forms can be achieved .    in this paper",
    "we first discuss the theoretical foundations of the underlying coupling creating the adiabatic potentials and present their advantages .",
    "these are then applied to create basic atom optical elements such as a double - well , a mach - zehnder interferometer and a ring trap .",
    "we also outline the implementation of a state - dependent splitting scheme for atomic clouds .",
    "we develop the theory by starting with the initial approach by zobay and garraway @xcite and extending it to fully account for the vector properties of the magnetic fields involved .",
    "only accounting for the latter leads to a complete description of the underlying couplings and the increased versatility of the resulting potentials .",
    "we consider an alkali atom in a hyper - fine level designated by the quantum number @xmath0 . assuming that @xmath0 remains a good quantum number even in the presence of a magnetic field , the atomic dynamics is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the @xmath3-factor of the hyper - fine level and @xmath4 the angular momentum operator .",
    "we assume @xmath5 to consist of a static part @xmath6 and an oscillatory part of the form @xmath7 as a first step we use the unitary transformation @xmath8 to transform the hamiltonian into a frame where the interaction of the atom with @xmath6 is diagonal , i.e. @xmath9\\mathbf{f}=|\\mathbf{b}_s(\\mathbf{r})|f_z.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have exploited that rotating the operator @xmath4 by using @xmath8 is equivalent to rotating the magnetic field vector @xmath6 by applying the appropriate rotation matrix @xmath10 .",
    "the operator @xmath11 can be represented as a diagonal matrix with the entries @xmath12 and @xmath13 denoting the magnetic hyper - fine sub - levels .",
    "we proceed by applying another unitary operation @xmath14 $ ] which effectuates a transformation into a frame that rotates with the angular velocity @xmath15 around the local direction of the static field @xmath16 .",
    "the application of @xmath17 leads to the emergence of additional terms that oscillate with the frequency @xmath18 . in the so - called rotating wave approximation - which we employ in the following",
    "- the oscillating terms are neglected .",
    "the now time - independent hamiltonian reads @xmath19",
    "f_z    + \\frac{g_f\\mu_b}{2}\\left (       \\begin{array}{c }         \\bar{b}_x \\\\         \\bar{b}_y \\\\",
    "\\end{array }     \\right)^t    \\left (       \\begin{array}{c }         f_x \\\\         f_y \\\\",
    "\\end{array }     \\right).\\label{eq : hamiltonian_2rf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term proportional to @xmath20 arises from the transformation of the time derivative in the time - dependent schrdinger equation . the field @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 where the matrix @xmath23 performs a rotation around the axis @xmath24 by the angle @xmath25 we want to emphasize that the sign of the rotation angle @xmath26 depends on the sign of the @xmath3-factor .",
    "therefore atoms in different hyperfine states will see different rf potentials even if they have the same magnetic moment @xmath27 .",
    "the adiabatic potentials are the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_2rf ] ) : @xmath28 ^ 2   + \\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\bar{b}_x^2+\\bar{b}_y^2\\right]}\\label{eq : adiabatic_potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 .    in the case of zero phaseshift ( @xmath30 ) ,",
    "i.e. a linear polarized rf field , the last term of the radical can be rewritten in a more convenient form : @xmath31 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "here it is immediately apparent that only the rf field components being perpendicular to the static field contribute .",
    "as a first example we consider the creation of a double - well potential starting from a ioffe - pritchard trap @xcite which is one of the most commonly used trapping field configuration .",
    "its magnetic field is given by @xmath32+b_\\text{i}\\mathbf{e}_z.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath33 is the gradient of the quadrupole field and @xmath34 the homogeneous ioffe field strength .",
    "we superimpose a homogeneous oscillatory rf field perpendicular to the ioffe field . without loss of generality",
    "we take @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the unitary transformation which diagonalizes the static part of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : initial_hamiltonian ] ) is given by @xmath37\\exp\\left[if_y\\beta\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "after the transformation into the rotated frame the adiabatic potential evaluates according to equation ( [ eq : adiabatic_potential ] ) to    @xmath41 ^ 2     + \\left[\\frac{b_\\text{rf}}{2|\\mathbf{b}_s(\\mathbf{r})|}\\right]^2(b_\\text{i}^2+g^2\\rho^2\\sin^2\\phi)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    its minima are located at @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "assuming that @xmath44 we can approximate @xmath45 with the position of the potential minimum @xmath46 the potential bottom @xmath47 the critical field strength @xmath48 and the detuning @xmath49 in order to arrive at the last term of equation ( [ eq : potential_bottom ] ) we have exploited @xmath50 for @xmath51 the potential @xmath52 exhibits only a single well whereas for @xmath53 one encounters a double - well configuration ( see figure [ fig : trap1]b ) .",
    "the trap frequency in each well evaluates approximately to @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the mass of the atom considered .",
    "there are several advantages of a rf interferometer over a static two - wire configuration @xcite :    1 .   the capability of performing a smooth transition from a true single well to a double - well , by varying any of the parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath34 .",
    "in contrast , in the static case one encounters a transition from two vertically to two horizontally split minima , if the strength of a homogeneous bias field is modulated @xcite . in the vicinity of the splitting region",
    "this leads to unwanted tunneling processes into the second vertical ( loss ) channel just before the intended splitting sets in @xcite .",
    "this poses a severe obstacle for establishing an adiabatic process .",
    "in addition the rf realization of the double well conserves the parabolic confinement perpendicular to the splitting direction even in the vicinity of the splitting region . here",
    "the confinement in the static configuration in both directions relies solely on a quartic potential .",
    "2 .   in the static realization the distance between the potential minima scales according to @xmath58 . here",
    "@xmath59 is the strength of a homogenous magnetic field which eventually gives rise to the splitting of the hexapole into two quadrupole minima @xcite .",
    "however , in order to have a stable splitting distance one has to precisely control the field strength @xmath59 , i.e. keep its fluctuations @xmath60 small .",
    "this is extremely hard in the vicinity of @xmath61 since @xmath62 . unlike this the splitting distance in the rf case obeys @xmath63 ( for zero detuning ) .",
    "thus we find @xmath64 to be much less sensitive with respect to fluctuations in @xmath57 particularly if @xmath57 is small .",
    "the rf adiabatic potential keeps much tighter confining wells even far away from the field generating structures , i.e. the chip surface .",
    "this can be illustrated considering an atom chip with structure size @xmath65 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity the quadrupole for the rf setup shall be created by a sideguide configuration @xcite in a distance @xmath65 above the chip surface .",
    "the static implementation of the double - well consists of two wires separated by 2d @xcite . provided that the wire current @xmath66 and @xmath34 are equal for both setups and assuming for simplicity @xmath67 the trap frequencies and the height of the barrier between the wells obey @xmath68 the essence of these expressions is their scaling with respect to the parameter @xmath65 which refers not only to the structure size but also to the distance of the potential wells to the chip surface .",
    "compared to the static two - wire case , a similar rf trap allows for realizing the same confinement with larger structures and thus farther away from the chip surface .",
    "the latter is of particular importance as hereby coherence - destroying surface interactions @xcite are strongly inhibited .",
    "the stronger increase of the potential barrier in the rf case is advantageous as it permits a true spatial separation of trapped atom clouds even for small splitting distances    the potential of the rf technique to coherently control the motion of atoms has recently enabled the demonstration of coherent splitting of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) on an atom chip @xcite .        in figure",
    "[ fig : trap1]a we present how a highly integrated realization of a rf double - well could look like .",
    "the quadrupole field is generated by a four - wire structure carrying counter - propagating dc currents . in - between these wires",
    "there is a broad wire flown through by an ac current .",
    "sufficiently close to this wire , the resultant rf field can be considered to be homogeneous .",
    "the ioffe field pointing into the plane of view is generated by additional wires which are not shown here @xcite .",
    "either a single well , a double - well or a ring - shaped potential emerge .",
    "( c ) a 3d confinement is achieved by introducing a spatially dependent rf amplitude of the form @xmath69 .",
    "visualization of the @xmath70 isosurface for this case.,width=491 ]    the potential bottom of the rf double - well increases proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "this provides an convenient mechanism to achieve confinement in the longitudinal direction . a z - dependence of the rf amplitude , i.e. @xmath72 , can be achieved by shaping the rf wire @xcite .",
    "for example a wire geometry creating a symmetric increase of the current density around @xmath73 , consequently , will lead to a symmetric increase of the rf amplitude ( see figure [ fig : trap1]c ) . hence , depending on the actual value of @xmath57 a three - dimensionally confining single- or double - well is achieved . similarly",
    "a mach - zehnder interferometer can be realized by varying the rf amplitude such that @xmath74 and @xmath75 with @xmath76 defining the length of the splitting region as indicated in figure [ fig : trap1]d .",
    "the variations of the potential bottom can be compensated by applying either a spatially varying ioffe field or an additional external potential .",
    "the latter can be realized for instance by placing a charged wire underneath the chip @xcite .",
    "the corresponding electric potential reads @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "as a second example we construct a more complex trapping geometry by employing two phase - shifted rf fields .",
    "we consider two orthogonal rf fields of the form @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which are superimposed on the static @xmath6 . according to equation ( [ eq : adiabatic_potential ] ) the corresponding adiabatic",
    "potential evaluates to    @xmath80 ^ 2    + \\frac{b_\\text{rf}^2}{8\\left|\\mathbf{b}_s(\\mathbf{r})\\right|^2 }    \\left[g^2\\rho^2(1+\\sin(2\\phi)\\cos\\delta)+2b_\\text{i}(b_\\text{i}+\\left|\\mathbf{b}_s(\\mathbf{r})\\right|\\sin\\delta)\\right]}.\\label{eq : ring_dw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath81 we find the minima and maxima at of the potential at @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively . if @xmath84 the positions of the minima and maxima simply exchange . assuming @xmath44 the radial position of these extrema is @xmath85 hence for @xmath81 and @xmath86 or @xmath84 and @xmath87 solely a single minimum can be achieved . for @xmath88 in any case only a single minimum is found .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ring1]a we present how such setup can be realized in a highly integrated way .",
    "the static quadrupole field is generated by a three wire setup .",
    "the two outer wires also serve as rf sources that are positioned such that two orthogonally polarized homogeneous fields in the vicinity of the quadrupole are created .",
    "the versatility of the potential ( [ eq : ring_dw ] ) lies in the fact that by simply varying the phase shift @xmath26 , i.e. changing the polarization of the rf field , one can either accomplish a single well , a double - well or a ring configuration .",
    "even a rotating double - well is achievable by appropriately tuning the phase and the rf amplitude .",
    "the double - well configuration with the strongest confinement is achieved for @xmath30 , i.e. vanishing relative phase shift of the rf fields . increasing the phase shift from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , i.e. from linear to circular polarization , results in a smooth transition to a ring - shaped potential of adjustable radius .",
    "this transition is shown in figure [ fig : ring1]b .",
    "the potentials shown are calculated for the typical set of experimental parameters @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in order to generate a confinement also in the longitudinal ( z-)direction",
    "we impose a modulation of the rf amplitude of the form @xmath95 . in figure",
    "[ fig : ring1]c the @xmath70 isosurface for @xmath96 is depicted .",
    "the ring - shaped potential is thus capable of confining becs as the typical energy scale associated to such matter waves is in the @xmath97-regime .",
    "the setup allows one to examine the collective ground state of ultra - cold atoms trapped on a ring @xcite . also building a ring interferometer ( sagnac - interferometer ) for matter waves is possible .",
    "coherence preserving loading of the latter could be done by preparing an ultra - cold atomic ensemble in the static wire trap .",
    "switching on the rf fields thereafter , and establishing the appropriate phase shift @xmath26 leads to a well controlled transition to the ring - shaped potential .",
    "such traps are particularly suited for building gyroscopes or rotation - sensors .",
    "@xcite have recently succeeded in loading a ring - shaped waveguide with a bec .",
    "their setup consists of millimeter - sized coils forming a magnetic quadrupole ring with diameters ranging from 1.2 to 3 mm .",
    "however , generating becs which are phase coherent over the entire ring is extremely difficult in such a macroscopic trap . in order to avoid the necessity of cooling to extremely low temperatures",
    "it is beneficial to use small rings with diameters of a few micrometers .",
    "also internal state - dependent manipulation of atoms can be achieved by using the potential ( [ eq : ring_dw ] ) .",
    "let us consider for instance the two hyperfine states @xmath98 and @xmath99 with the same magnetic moment @xmath100 .",
    "consequently in a static field atoms in either of these states are subjected to the same trapping potential .",
    "suppose now the rf field is switched on adiabatically such that @xmath101 .",
    "in the case when @xmath102 we have @xmath103 .",
    "thus if one picks @xmath104 atoms being in state @xmath98 see a ring whereas atoms in state @xmath99 are confined to a single centered potential minimum as seen in figure [ fig : ring1]b .",
    "in conclusion dressed rf adiabatic potentials are versatilely applicable to build atom optical elements and offer a number of significant advantages over their static implementations .",
    "rf - based traps provide tight confinement even at large surface distances and allow for a smooth transition from a single to a double - well .",
    "moreover , a rf double - well is more robust against experimental fluctuations against its static counterpart which is certainly advantageous for performing tunneling experiments .",
    "this technique paves the way to the realization of complex coherence preserving potentials on a micro scale by using simple and highly integrated setups .",
    "this is of particular importance for such demanding applications as quantum information processing and high precision measurements based on matter wave interference .",
