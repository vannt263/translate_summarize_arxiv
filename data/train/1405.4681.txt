    "in recent years , cooperative control of multi - agent systems has attracted considerable attention in the control community , thanks to the broad applications in various areas , such as biology ( e.g. , flocking of birds @xcite ) , social sciences ( e.g. , evolution of language @xcite ) and engineering ( e.g. , formation control of uavs @xcite ) , etc .",
    "like consensus problem @xcite , containment control is also regarded as a fundamental problem in the cooperative control of multi - agent systems .",
    "containment control means that a group of agents converge to the convex hull which is spanned by other group of agents .",
    "additional details related to the containment control problem may be obtained from references therein .",
    "the consensus problem was primarily considered without leader @xcite .",
    "however , a group of agents might have one or multiple leaders in the agent network . for the single leader",
    ", the followers will converge to the state of leader , which is called the tracking control or leader - following consensus problem . in @xcite , tracking control problem for multi - agent systems was studied with an active leader under time - varying undirected topology . in @xcite , leader - following consensus of high - order multi - agent systems was considered with fixed and switching topologies . @xcite",
    "investigated the consensus of heterogeneous multi - agent systems with a time - varying group reference velocity .",
    "if the multi - agent system has multiple leaders , the objective is to drive the followers into the convex hull spanned by the leaders , which is called the containment control problem .",
    "motivated by the numerous natural phenomena and applications in engineering , containment control has been considered by lots of researchers in recent years . in @xcite ,",
    "a stop - go control policy was proposed to drive a collection of the followers to a given target destination which is spanned by the leaders . in @xcite ,",
    "finite - time attitude containment control was considered for multiple rigid bodies under undirected topology .",
    "@xcite considered containment control of first - order multi - agent systems with switching topologies .",
    "containment control of second - order multi - agent systems with multiple stationary and dynamic leaders was studied under fixed and switching topologies in @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the containment control of second - order multi - agent systems with random switching topologies .",
    "@xcite gave some necessary and sufficient conditions for the containment control of multi - agent systems with multiple stationary and dynamic leaders under directed networks .",
    "in @xcite , the containment control of heterogeneous multi - agent systems was also discussed under directed networks .    it should be noted that all the aforementioned results were assumed that the communication channel is ideal .",
    "however , real networks are often unideal because of uncertain communication environment .",
    "thus , it is natural to consider the noise in the distributed protocols for cooperative control of multi - agent systems .",
    "huang and manton proposed a a stochastic approximation type protocol for discrete - time first - order multi - agent systems with measurement noises @xcite and proved the mean square consensus and strong consensus under randomly varying topologies @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the stochastic approximation type protocol under time - varying topologies and proved that mean square and almost sure consensus can be ensured if the network switches among balanced and jointly - containing - spanning - tree graphs . in @xcite ,",
    "the continuous - time stochastic approximation type consensus was studied and necessary and sufficient conditions on the control gain function were given .",
    "@xcite extended the results in @xcite to study the mean square consensus and strong consensus of continuous - time first - order multi - agent systems under general fixed directed graph .",
    "the result of @xcite was also extended to the second - order case with local feedback in @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the finite time consensus of stochastic multi - agent systems .",
    "it is noted that the tracking control and containment control of multi - agent systems with measurement noises only receives a little attention . in @xcite , tracking control of multi - agent systems was considered with an active leader and measurement noises under directed topology and some sufficient conditions were obtained for solving the mean square consensus .",
    "@xcite studied the containment control of discrete - time multi - agent systems with multiple stationary leaders and noisy measurements and gave some sufficient conditions for solving the consensus almost surely and in mean square .",
    "inspired by the recent developments in containment control and stochastic approximation type consensus protocols , we investigate the containment control of multi - agent systems with measurement noises under the fixed directed topology in this paper .",
    "different from @xcite , we consider continuous - time multi - agent systems with multiple stationary and dynamic leaders , respectively .",
    "containment control of continuous - time multi - agent systems for noise - free cases has been widely studied .",
    "for example , @xcite investigated the containment control of multi - agent systems without noise and obtained some necessary and sufficient conditions for solving the containment control with multiple stationary and dynamic leaders under the directed topology . due to the measurement noises",
    ", the distributed protocol should be designed with the time - varying gains @xmath1 and the closed - loop system becomes a time - varying stochastic differential equation .",
    "the laplacian matrix is asymmetric in a directed graph .",
    "all of these make difficulties and challenges for the convergence analysis of containment control problem .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , we employ a stochastic approximation type protocol for the multi - agent system with multiple stationary leaders . by using stochastic lyapunov theory , algebraic graph theory and doob s martingale convergence theorem ,",
    "some necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for solving the containment control in the sense of mean square and probability @xmath0 under the directed topology .",
    "secondly , a stochastic approximation type protocol with distributed estimators is developed for the multi - agent system with multiple dynamic leaders .",
    "similar to the case of multiple stationary leaders , we obtain some necessary and sufficient conditions for solving the containment control in the sense of mean square and probability @xmath0 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s - preliminaries ] , we present some notions in graph theory and assemble some key lemmas .",
    "we provide convergence analysis for containment control of multi - agent systems with multiple stationary leaders in section [ s - stationary ] and multiple dynamic leaders in section [ s - dynamic ] . in section [ s - simulations ] , numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results . in section",
    "[ s - conclusion ] , some conclusions are drawn .",
