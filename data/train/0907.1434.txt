    "we have shown that holography supports a finite entropy and thus shear viscosity at the coldest point .",
    "while the d3/d7 embedding allows for a derivation of the fermionic ground state energy per particle , the result depends only on @xmath154 , a fundamental parameter in holography .",
    "we recall that trapped atomic experiments put @xmath134 .",
    "we have found that the effects of temperature as suggested by the rn ads black hole construction compare favorably with current atomic measurements .",
    "in particular the entropy versus energy dependence in cold atoms is derived acuratly .",

    "our construction also shows explicitly how the shear viscosity ties with the entropy ( degeneracy ) of the cold black hole at zero temperature .",
    "the specific heat and equation of state @xmath106 we discussed in this paper strongly suggest that the relevant degree of freedom at low temperature is massless and fermionic . very recently",

    ". however , the conductivity of charged ads bh at a cold point is @xmath157 while we expect @xmath158 for fermi liquid .",
    "therefore the issue of gravity dual of fermionic system is not totally clear and it is still waiting further investigation .",
    "the existence of a finite entropy at zero temperature for charged black holes is very intriguing as no bekenstein - hawking radiation can be assigned to it in standard gravity .",
    "precise measurements of the entropy of trapped cold atoms may shed light on this fundamental concept at the coldest point .",
    "the latter is currently probed only by theoretical extrapolations to have zero entropy at @xmath111 .",
