    "the calculation reveals a mixed manifold around the fermi level with main contributions of ce-@xmath2 , ru-@xmath18 and sn-@xmath19 character @xcite .",
    "the narrow @xmath2-bands are essentially placed between 0.1 and 0.7 ev above the fermi level in dft .",
    "because of the small hybridization tail below the fermi level , the dft @xmath2-filling is nonetheless surprisingly large , i.e. , @xmath20 electrons per ce atom .",
    "[ fig : ceru4sn6_dos1 ] ( bottom ) shows that the spin - orbit coupling separates the ce-@xmath2 states into @xmath3 states , whose center of gravity is approximately around @xmath21 ev , and @xmath22 states around @xmath23 ev . the crystal field further splits the @xmath3 manifold into @xmath24 character at higher energy and @xmath25 as well as @xmath5 states at essentially the same energy .",
    "the crystal field splitting between the latter is only @xmath26ev with @xmath25 below @xmath5 .",
    "this reflects in the small splitting in the @xmath2-level at @xmath27ev in fig .",
    "[ fig : ceru4sn6_dos1 ] ( bottom ) . nonetheless , the largest contribution below the fermi level has @xmath28 character because these states hybridize more strongly with ru-@xmath18 than the other @xmath2 orbitals [ the integrated weight below the fermi level is larger for the @xmath5 orbital in fig .",

    "the corresponding bandstructure of ceru@xmath0sn@xmath1 is shown in fig  [ fig : ceru4sn6_bands1 ] .",
    "there is a small dip above the fermi level .",
    "this is due to a dft direct gap between the highest lying occupied band  ( mainly ru - d ) and the lowest  ( unoccupied ) @xmath2 states with mixed @xmath25 and @xmath5 character .",
    "as one can see in fig  [ fig : ceru4sn6_bands1 ] , the valence and conduction band both touch the fermi level however so that the indirect dft band gap is zero .",
    "also note that the lack of inversion symmetry around the ce atoms lifts the degeneracy between the @xmath29 components .",
    "next , we do a projection onto maximally localized wannier orbitals @xcite using the wien2wannier @xcite package . in this material",
    ", the spin - orbit coupling is crucial which makes the identification of adequate wannier orbitals for modelling the low energy degrees of freedom more difficult .",
    "the decisive aspect is the choice of the atomic orbitals @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the wien2wannier localization to start with .",
    "for example , for @xmath32 we start with @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the ( lm)-basis , respectively ; the prefactors are the clebsch - gordan coefficients .",

    "we supplement the @xmath57 wannier hamiltonian by a local interaction @xmath58ev between all ce-@xmath3 states and subtract the double counting in the fully localized limit @xcite .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is then solved by dmft with hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo @xcite simulations .",
    "note that the ce-@xmath22 orbitals remain unoccupied well above the fermi level so that we do not need to include them as interacting in dmft .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we neglect hund s exchange which is justified since ce only has about one @xmath2-electron and employ the same dmft self energy for @xmath29 .",

    "the kondo effect can be identified by the development of a kondo resonance at the fermi level when decreasing the temperature from @xmath66 k to @xmath67 k , see fig .",

    "[ fig : ceru4sn6_spectrum4],title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    to get a better impression of the correlated bandstructure , we hence set the imaginary part of the self energy to ( essentially zero ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : ceru4sn6_spectrum3 ] . this way one can also mimick the low temperature behavior since the imaginary part of the self energy vanishes like @xmath72 around the fermi level .",
    "one should keep in mind however , that the further build - up of the kondo resoance might still reshuffle the bandstructure at lower temperatures .",
    "given the small crystal field splitting between @xmath9 and @xmath10 and its reversal by correlations as well as the much higher kondo temperature for a su(4 ) than a su(2 ) kondo effect , we can expect that both states will still contribute to the low temperature kondo resonance .    in principle ,",

    "there is ( ii ) a negative _ indirect _ band gap .",
    "these are two independent meachisms of why ceru@xmath0sn@xmath1 remains metallic with quite some anisotropy .",
    "the origin of the gap is the usual kondo insulator scenario , i.e. , the hybridization between ce-@xmath2 and ru-@xmath39(sn-@xmath41 ) conduction bands .",

    "these band go over smoothly into a flat predominantly ce @xmath9 band . in principle",
    "the same picture can also be found above the fermi level . however , here it is somewhat less clear , since the conduction band maxima e.g. between @xmath76 and @xmath73 or @xmath78 and @xmath73 are not well separated from the other bands .    around @xmath74 and @xmath78 ,",
    "the whole low - energy bandstructure is shifted upwards . here",
    "the gap is well above the fermi level .",
    "hence , we only have a direct band gap at most @xmath16-points whereas the indirect gap is zero , we have a kondo semimetal .",
    "note that the term semimetal has been used before , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , to classify cenisn but to the best of our knowledge in another connotation , i.e. , to denote the weak metallic behavior  even with the ikeda - miyake scenario @xcite in mind , i.e. , a hybridization gap with nodes and hence a crossing of conduction and @xmath2 band .",
    "moreover , along the @xmath4 direction , we even have a gap - less crossing of bands , see fig .  [",
    "fig : ceru4sn6_spectrum3 ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ceru4sn6_spectrum4 ] we infer that at @xmath73 the lowest ( spin - split ) band is @xmath9 , the second one @xmath10 and the topmost the predominately ru conduction band .",

    "altogether this scenario is much more complicated than a simple model with flat @xmath2-band . in ref .",
    "it was concluded that since @xmath9 orbitals have no nodes , the @xmath9 kondo insulator has to be gapped throughout the brillouin zone .",
    "this scenario is however too simple for ceru@xmath0sn@xmath1 .",
    "first of all , there are both , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , bands in the vicinity of the fermi level ; and we ( i ) hence observe a crossing of bands .",
    "even if we had no such crossing , we would ( ii ) nontheless still have a kondo semimetal with remnant metallicity instead of a kondo insulator since the indirect band gap is negative . because of these two reasons , the idealized modelling of ref",
