    "in 1998 and 1999 a new mesocrystal was reported  @xcite which combines both electrorheological ( er ) or magnetorheological ( mr ) effects .",
    "this sort of mesocrystal is also called electro- and magneto - rheological ( emr ) solids .",
    "in fact , er  @xcite and mr  @xcite fluids are generally particle suspensions in which the particles have large electric polarizability or magnetic permeability . in the application of an external electric or magnetic field",
    ", the suspended particles can form body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) mesocrystallities , namely er or mr solids  @xcite .",
    "the emr solid shows very interesting properties when the applied electric field @xmath0 ( in @xmath1 axis ) is perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath2 ( in @xmath3 or @xmath4 axis ) . in detail , in case of dominate electric field or dominate magnetic field , emr solids have thick columns in the dominate field direction .",
    "these columns have a bct lattice as the ideal structure , too .",
    "recently , a novel structural transition in emr solids was theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite observed from bct to face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice in the presence of crossed electric and magnetic fields as the ratio between the magnetic field and electric field exceeds a minimum value .",
    "understanding the magnetic properties of emr solids is critical to the design of emr - fluid - based devices .",
    "also , these magnetic properties may provide valuable insight into the character of the microstructure responsible for their field - dependent rheology as well as models of the emr effect .",
    "since for emr solids the uniaxial anisotropy occurs naturally , the magnetic properties in longitudinal fields ( l ) should be different from those in tranverse fields ( t ) .",
    "furthermore , the structural transition can affect the effective magnetic properties , and the longe - range interaction between the particles ( lattice effect ) should be expected to play an important role as well .",
    "thus , prediction of the overall magnetic properties of emr solids is indeed a challenging task .    to calculate the effective permeability of emr solids ,",
    "the existing methods for cubic arrays of spheres  @xcite or for a suspension containing a dense array of particles  @xcite can not be used directly .",
    "recently , one developed a theory of homogenization to study the effective permeability of mr solids with a periodic microstructure  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall present a statistical - mechanical theory , in order to calculate the effective permeability of the emr solids .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , by developing the kirkwood - frhlich equation and using the ewald - kornfeld formulation , we present a statistical - mechanical theory for the effective permeability of the emr solids , and the numerical results are given as well .",
    "this paper ends with a discussion and conclusion in sec .",
    "for an emr solid , its effective permeability @xmath5 is uniaxially anisotropic due to the application of external fields . in detail ,",
    "the transverse component @xmath6 ( in @xmath3 or @xmath4 axis ) differs from the longitudinal component @xmath7 ( in @xmath1 axis ) . in this connection ,",
    "the effective permeability @xmath5 should possess a tensorial form like _",
    "e = (    ccc _",
    "e^(t ) & 0 & 0 + 0 & _",
    "e^(t ) & 0 + 0 & 0 & _",
    "e^(l )    ) .[mue ] since all the permeable particles of the emr solid have a permanent magnetic dipole moment @xmath8 , it becomes more difficult to derive the expression for @xmath5 . for this purpose ,",
    "kirkwood  @xcite and frhlich  @xcite introduced a continuum with permeability @xmath9 which arises from induced magnetization only .",
    "based on it , we shall derive the effective permeability @xmath5 of the emr solid consisting of permeable particles with a permanent magnetic moment @xmath8 .",
    "let us start by seeing each particle with @xmath8 to have a new tensorial moment @xmath10 , ",
    "= [ moment ] and to be embedded in a new host ( introduced continuum ) of @xmath9 , where @xmath11 denotes the permeability of the nonmagnetic carrier fluid , and @xmath12 a unit matrix . the denominators in eq .",
    "( [ moment ] ) and in the following equations should be interpreted as inverse matrices . in this model",
    "each particle is replaced by a point dipole @xmath10 having the same non - electrostatic interactions with the other point dipoles as the particles had , while the magnetizability of the particles can be imagined to be smeared out to form a continuum with permeability @xmath9 , which will be derived in sec .",
    "( [ induced ] ) .",
    "next , to include the anisotropic feature , we take a characteristic spheroid of volume @xmath13 , which contains @xmath14 particles . in doing so , the particles in the spheroid will be treated explicitly by taking into account the contribution of the particle interaction to the effective permeability . in principle , the approximation in this method can be made as small as necessary by taking @xmath14 sufficiently large .",
    "here we should remark that for discussing isotropic cases kirkwood  @xcite and frhlich  @xcite used a characteristic sphere . as a matter of fact ,",
    "no matter for a sphere or a spheroid , each of them should reflect the physical properties of the whole suspension . for instance",
    ", the number density inside the sphere or spheroid should be identical to that of the whole system under consideration . in this regard , for the present emr",
    "solid a characteristic sphere is far from being satisfactory , and a characteristic spheroid can be used instead so that the uniaxially anisotropic behavior of the suspension may be considered more physically .",
    "we shall show that the explicit spheroidal shape of choice can be determined exactly , see eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) below .",
    "all statistical - mechanical theories of the permeability start from - _ 2 * h * = 4 _ t,[de1 ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denotes the magnetic induction and maxwell field in the material outside the spheroid , respectively . by definition , we write for the magnetization density @xmath17 as _ t v = _",
    "t , [ de2 ] where @xmath18 stands for the average total magnetic moment of the spheroid . here and below @xmath19 stands for a statistical mechanical average , e.g. , @xmath20 in this expression , @xmath21 stands for the set of position and orientation variables of all particles . here",
    "@xmath22 is the energy related to the dipoles in the spheroid , and it consists of three parts : the energy of the dipoles in the external field , the magnetostatic interaction energy of the dipoles , and the non - magnetostatic interaction energy between the dipoles which are responsible for the short - range correlation between orientations and positions of the dipoles .",
    "then , the tensorial effective permeability @xmath5 of the whole system can be defined as = _",
    "e*h * .[de3 ] in view of eqs .",
    "( [ de2 ] )  and  ( [ de3 ] ) , we take one step forward to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ de1 ] ) as ( _ e - _ 2)*h * = _ t .",
    "since @xmath23 has the same direction as @xmath16 , it suffices to calculate the average component of @xmath24 in the direction of @xmath16 , thus we have ( _ e - _ 2 ) * h * = _ t . here @xmath25 is the unit vector in the direction of the field .",
    "in general , @xmath17 and @xmath26 contain also terms in higher powers of @xmath16 .",
    "thus , @xmath27 is the first term in a series development of @xmath28 ( induced magnetization ) in powers of @xmath2 , and must be set equal to the term linear in @xmath2 of the series development of @xmath29 in a taylor series .",
    "so , we obtain _ e-_2= ( ) _ h = 0 . owing to @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    ", we have _",
    "e-_e0 = 4 ( ) _ h = 0 , where @xmath32 stands for the orientational magnetization arising from the permanent magnetic moments . rewriting with the external field",
    "@xmath33 instead of the maxwell field @xmath2 as the independent variable we obtain _ e-_e0 = ( ) _ h = 0 ( ) _ h_0 = 0,[c0 ] where @xmath34 . in this case , the external field acting on the spheroid is _ 0= (    ccc & 0 & 0 + 0 & & 0 + 0 & 0 &    ) * h * , [ c1 ] where the tensorial depolarization factor @xmath35 represents the spheroid shape .",
    "in fact , the degree of field - induced anisotropy of the system is determined by how @xmath35 deviates from @xmath36 ( isotropic limit ) .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath35 will be determined explicitly [ see eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) ] , and that its components satisfy a sum rule @xmath37  @xcite .    starting from ( ) _ h_0 = 0 = -_o _ h_0 = 0 , eventually we have ( ) _ h_0 = 0 = _ o^2 _",
    "h_0 = 0.[c2 ]    if we use a tensorial kirkwood correlation factor @xmath38 , then we obtain _ o^2 _",
    "h_0 = 0 = n^2.[c3 ] in view of eqs .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) ,  ( [ c2 ] )  and  ( [ c3 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ c0 ] ) can be rewritten as _",
    "e-_e0 = ^2,[huang ] where @xmath39 denotes the number density of the particles . for an isotropic system , namely @xmath40 ,",
    "( [ huang ] ) reduces to the usual kirkwood - frhlich equation  @xcite which works for permeable particles with a permanent magnetic moment .",
    "if @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , eq .",
    "( [ huang ] ) reduces to the onsager equation  @xcite which treats non - permeable particles with a permanent magnetic moment embedded in vacuum .",
    "however , it is worth noting that in the derivation of the onsager equation only one particle is considered in the characteristic sphere .",
    "that is , there is no more correlations between the particle orientations than can be accounted for with the help of the continuum method , thus yielding @xmath43 .",
    "now we are in a position to derive the induced - magnetization - related permeabibility @xmath9 by performing an ewald - kornfeld formulation  @xcite so that the structural transition and long - range interaction can be taken into account explicitly .",
    "the ground state of the emr solid is a bct ( body - centered tetragonal ) lattice , which can be regarded as a tetragonal lattice , plus a basis of two particles each of which is fixed with an induced point magnetic dipole at its center .",
    "one of the two particles is located at a corner and the other one at the body center of the tetragonal unit cell .",
    "its lattice constants are denoted by @xmath44 and @xmath45 along the @xmath46 and @xmath47 axes , respectively . in this case , the uniaxial anisotropic axis is directed along @xmath1 axis .",
    "as @xmath48 varies , the volume of the unit cell keeps unchanged , i.e. @xmath49 thus , the degree of anisotropy of the tetragonal lattice is measured by how @xmath48 is deviated from unity . in particular , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 represents the bct , bcc ( body - centered cubic ) and fcc lattice , respectively .",
    "when one applies an external magnetic field @xmath53 along @xmath3 axis , the induced dipole moment @xmath54 are perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis .",
    "then , the local field @xmath55 at the lattice point @xmath56 can be determined .",
    "let us take the transverse component as an example , and resort to the ewald - kornfeld formulation  @xcite to calculate the local field @xmath57 such that h_lc = p_j=1 ^ 2_[-_1(r_j)+x_j^2q^2_2(r_j)]-_()()+[ex ] .",
    "in this equation , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are two coefficients , given by    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the complementary error function , and @xmath62 an adjustable parameter making the summation converge rapidly . in eq .",
    "( [ ex ] ) , @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote the lattice vector and the reciprocal lattice vector , respectively , @xmath65 where @xmath66 are integers .",
    "in addition , @xmath67 and @xmath68 of eq .",
    "( [ ex ] ) are given by , @xmath69 and the structure factor @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "so far , let us define a local field factor @xmath71 , = .",
    "it is worth remarking that @xmath71 is a function of a single variable , namely degree of anisotropy @xmath72 also , there is a sum rule @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "as @xmath74 , @xmath75 just represents the isotropic limit .",
    "next , we take one step forward to rewrite the well - known maxwell - garnett theory for isotropic suspensions as  @xcite = f,[amga ] where @xmath76 stands for the permeability of the particles .",
    "this is a developed maxwell - garnett theory for uniaxially anisotropic suspensions  @xcite .",
    "then it is not difficult to see that the depolarization factor @xmath35 [ eq .  ( [ c1 ] ) ] characterizing the shape of the characteristic spheroid of choice is determined by = .",
    "[ relation ] the substitution of @xmath9 [ obtained from eq .",
    "( [ amga ] ) ] into eq .",
    "( [ huang ] ) leads to @xmath77 as a result .",
    "let us do some numerical simulations .",
    "figure 1 displays @xmath78 and @xmath7 as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "for this figure , we used the onsager consideration ( i.e. , assuming the characteristic spheroid contains only one particle , @xmath41 ) , with a focus on the anisotropic effect .",
    "as @xmath74 , this system is in the isotropic limit , yielding @xmath79 .",
    "thus , in fig .  1 the two points at @xmath74 are overlapped .",
    "it is found that the structural transition of the emr solid ( measured by the variation of @xmath48 ) can cause @xmath5 to change . to some extent ,",
    "the numerical simulations show the validity of monitoring the structure of emr solids by detecting their effective permeabilities .",
    "here some comments are in order .",
    "an approximation expression for the kirkwood correlation factor @xmath38 can be obtained by taking only nearest - neighbors interactions into account  @xcite . in this case , the characteristic spheroid may be shrunk to contain only the @xmath80-th particle and all the nearest neighbors .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath81 or @xmath82 will be different from 1 when there is correlation between the orientations of neighboring particles .",
    "when the particles tend to direct themselves with parallel permanent magnetic moments , @xmath81 or @xmath82 will be larger than 1 . when the particles prefer an ordering with anti - parallel moments , @xmath81 or @xmath82 will be smaller than 1 . as the emr solid",
    "is subjected to the external magnetic field , all the particles can easily direct themselves with parallel permanent magnetic moments . in this connection , @xmath81 or @xmath82 should be larger than @xmath51 , or",
    "could approximately equal to @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the number of the closest neighboring particles .",
    "nevertheless , once @xmath85 , the correlation between the nearest particles is included approximately , and this ( no figures shown here ) does not affect the present numerical result on the anisotropic effect as @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "in particular , as @xmath88 ( i.e. , for a bct lattice ) , we obtain @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "they both are larger than those of @xmath87 due to the correlation , as expected .    the bergman - milton spectral representation ( bmsr )",
    "@xcite is an effective method for calculating the effective dielectric constant of a two - phase composite , and has been successfully applied in electrorheological fluids  @xcite , in order to discuss the frequency - dependent complex dielectric constant .",
    "alternatively , the bmsr should be expected to work for emr solids , and a favorable comparison between the bmsr and the ewald summation technique used in this work is expected .    to sum up",
    ", the aim of the present work is to develop a statistical - mechanical theory in order to calculate the effective permeability of a new mesocrystal ( emr solid ) .",
    "this theory allows one to study the overall magnetic properties of emr solids , by taking into account the anisotropy and structural transition effects and the long - range interaction between the suspended particles .",
