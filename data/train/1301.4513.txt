    "spintronic applications like spin - transfer - torque magnetic random access memory ( stt - mram ) or magnetic domain wall - based devices require advances in materials to reach their full potential .",
    "the goal of improving these materials has led to the study of bilayers consisting of ferromagnetic layers and non - magnetic layers with strong spin orbit coupling .",
    "recent measurements on such systems have demonstrated efficient switching of magnetic tunnel junctions,@xcite like those used in stt - mram , and efficient current - driven domain wall motion.@xcite    there are a number of physical processes@xcite in these systems that contribute to the magnetization dynamics as described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation .",
    "these include the typical micromagnetic contributions , like interatomic exchange , magnetostatic interactions , magnetocrystalline anisotropy , and damping , as well as the adiabatic and non - adiabatic spin transfer torques@xcite that are typically added to account for the coupling between the magnetization and the electrical current flowing through it . in the bilayers of interest here , there are additional contributions that have received extensive attention .",
    "these arise from the spin - orbit coupling in the non - magnetic layer and from the enhanced spin - orbit coupling at the interfaces between layers .",
    "these additional contributions have been modeled in terms of two different pictures .",
    "one picture@xcite assumes that the layers are thick and the two layers have their bulk properties .",
    "a current flowing through the non - magnetic layer with strong spin - orbit coupling generates a spin current perpendicular to the interface ( the spin hall effect.@xcite ) when this spin current impinges on the interface , there is a spin transfer torque@xcite on the magnetization of the magnetic layer .",
    "the details of the torque in this picture are determined by the bulk spin hall angle in the material with strong spin - orbit coupling and the mixing conductance .",
    "the other picture@xcite assumes two dimensional transport that can be described by a rashba model , similar to those used to describe spin - orbit coupling in two - dimensional electron gases.@xcite the rashba model gives direct coupling between the magnetization and the flowing current .",
    "both models give qualitatively similar results , that is torques along the @xmath0 and @xmath1 $ ] directions , where @xmath2 is the magnetization , @xmath3 is the in - plane current density and the interface normal is in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "we refer to the first torque as a field - like torque because it has the same form as precessional torque around an effective field in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the second torque has the same form as a damping torque toward a field in that same direction and we refer to it as a damping - like torque.@xcite    both models have strengths and weaknesses .",
    "the rashba model treats the strong spin - orbit coupling at the interfaces between the materials but treats the transport as two - dimensional .",
    "the layer thicknesses are usually comparable to mean free paths and spin diffusion lengths requiring a three dimensional description of the transport . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin - hall - effect spin - transfer - torque model treats the three dimensional aspect of the transport , but ignores any contributions from the modification of the spin - orbit coupling near the interface . the non - magnetic layer and the magnetic layer affect the electronic structure of each other close to the interface and the interaction can significantly change the spin - orbit coupling there . in particular",
    ", the proximity to the ferromagnet can induce a moment in the material with strong spin - orbit coupling giving a thin layer where the magnetism and the spin - orbit coupling coexist.@xcite    attempts to develop predictive models face the complication that the experimental structures deviate significantly from the ideal structures treated theoretically .",
    "experimental indications@xcite that interfaces of co grown on pt have different properties than interfaces of pt grown on co argue strongly that the details of the interface structure are both nontrivial and important .",
    "unfortunately , the interfaces are not well enough characterized to know what types of disorder might be present",
    ". there may be significant interdiffusion at the interfaces because , for example , pt alloys with co in the bulk .",
    "there is also significant lattice mismatch between the materials .",
    "this mismatch could promote thickness fluctuations and dislocation formation . without measurements of atomic scale structure of the experimental samples ,",
    "it is impossible to know how important such defects are to the behavior of the system .    motivated by the uncertainty in the details of the experimental structures and the goal of incorporating the strengths of existing models , we develop simple semiclassical models for these systems .",
    "one approach is based on the boltzmann equation and the other on the drift - diffusion equation .",
    "both capture the essential physics of the models that have been used so far and provide a test for whether a model based on bulk properties and enhanced spin - orbit coupling at the interface can account for the experimental behavior .",
    "we find that these models are general enough to reproduce the torques measured in any single sample for reasonable values of the parameters , but not all samples with a single parameterization . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] we summarize the experimental evidence for the different interpretations .",
    "we also summarize the micromagnetic simulations that provide the basis for these interpretations .",
    "we briefly present the semiclassical transport models in sec .",
    "[ sec : be ] and then apply them in sec .",
    "[ sec : shstt ] to the model for a bulk spin hall current in the non - magnetic layer leading to a spin transfer torque at the interface with the ferromagnet . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rashba ] we add in the interfacial spin orbit coupling and show that this captures the important physics that is included in the rashba - model approaches .",
    "recent experiments on multi - layer structures report evidence for current - induced torques due to spin - orbit coupling .",
    "these torques are reported to be large enough to modify the magnetization dynamics and may be utilized to facilitate spintronic applications .",
    "various experiments report conflicting results for the size and direction of the torque .",
    "many of these values are inferred from measurements of the resulting dynamics in conjunction with simulations .",
    "this section aims to summarize the evidence from experiments , in conjunction with simulations , for different forms of the torque .",

    "the authors of the second set of experiments interpret their results in terms of an important field like torque that they attribute to interfacial spin orbit coupling .    in the case of the spin hall effect",
    ", electron trajectories are preferentially scattered in different directions depending on their spin directions .",
    "for instance , in a non - magnetic material with positive spin hall angle , electrons are scattered more strongly into directions such that @xmath6 is positive , where @xmath7 is the electron velocity before ( after ) the scattering and @xmath8 is the electron spin direction . thus in the bilayer system in fig .",
    "[ fig : bilayer ] , the spin hall effect in the non - magnetic layer injects electrons with spin along @xmath9 direction into a magnetic layer if @xmath10 is along @xmath11 direction and the spin hall angle is positive .",

    "they estimate the spin hall angle of pt to be about + 0.076 , which is about two orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding value in @xmath16-doped gaas.@xcite this demonstrates that the spin hall effect can be a realistic tool to enhance spin torque efficiency . in their subsequent work@xcite for the ta / co@xmath17fe@xmath17b@xmath18 bilayer",
    ", they demonstrate that the spin - hall - induced damping - like torque can switch the magnetization in a reliable and efficient way , facilitating the development of magnetic memory and nonvolatile spin logic technologies . from three different measurements ( spin - torque ferromagnetic resonance , current - dependent anomalous hall effect , threshold current density for magnetization switching )",
    ", they estimate the spin hall angle of ta to be @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "this angle is of opposite sign compared to pt but most notably , larger by about a factor of two . in their still later work,@xcite",
    "they demonstrate that the magnetization switching can be achieved by the spin hall effect in pt(2  nm)/co(0.6  nm)/alo@xmath21 systems as well , although the spin hall angle in pt is smaller .",
    "most recently , they have determined an even larger spin hall angle in w.@xcite    on the other hand , miron _ et al_.@xcite explore effects of the rashba spin - orbit coupling with focus on the system pt(3 nm)/co(0.6  nm)/alo@xmath21(2  nm ) . the layer structure of the film breaks inversion symmetry and gives rise to perpendicular magnetic anisotropy strong enough that the ground state for the magnetization is out of plane . in these experiments , the nominally symmetric control system pt(3",
    "nm)/co(0.6  nm)/pt(3  nm ) , shows much weaker effects , leading to the inference that the broken inversion symmetry for the layer plays a crucial role .",
    "miron _ et al _ interpret their results in terms of a large field - like torque as expected from the rashba model@xcite for interfacial spin - orbit coupling .",
    "calculations@xcite predict an effective field@xcite @xmath22 when a system is subject to the rashba spin - orbit coupling of the form @xmath23 . here",

    "they find that transverse in - plane magnetic fields enhance the nucleation and that this enhancement is modified by currents flowing through the film .",
    "in - plane currents @xmath10 flowing through the system enhance ( suppress ) the nucleation of reversed magnetic domains when the direction @xmath30 is parallel ( anti - parallel ) to externally applied in - plane magnetic fields . in the nominally symmetric control sample ,",
    "the effect of in - plane current is much weaker .",
    "the authors interpret the effect of in - plane currents as evidence for the current - induced effective field along @xmath31 , as predicted theoretically for systems with rashba - like spin orbit coupling .",
    "experimentally,@xcite the magnitude of the effective field is proportional to @xmath10 with a proportionality constant @xmath32 t/(a@xmath33 m@xmath34 ) .",
    "this value implies @xmath35 0.2 evnm,@xcite which is comparable to @xmath36 evnm reported for bi / ag(111 ) surface@xcite and comparable to a recent first principles calculation result for a pt / co bilayer.@xcite    further evidence for a field - like torque is found in measurements@xcite of current - driven domain wall ( dw ) motion in the same system .",
    "as the driving current density goes up , the domain wall velocity @xmath37 increases to speeds up to @xmath38  m / s , more than three times faster than previously measured current - driven domain wall velocities.@xcite the authors claim that this velocity is twice as large as the rate @xmath39 of the spin angular momentum transfer , where @xmath40 is the gyromagnetic ratio . even up to such high domain wall speeds",
    ", the domain walls apparently did not undergo structural instability ( walker breakdown.@xcite ) according to conventional theories@xcite of current - driven domain wall motion , domain wall velocities above @xmath41 are possible below the breakdown current density @xmath42 .",
    "as the ratio @xmath43 increases , the breakdown current density decreases such that conventional theories can not explain the velocities measured in this experiment.@xcite    as a possible explanation , the authors suggest@xcite that the current - induced effective field @xmath27 could increase the breakdown current density .",
    "consider the two low energy structures [ figs .",
    "[ fig : dw - structures](a ) and ( b ) ] of the bloch domain wall .",
    "these walls differ from each other because they have opposite magnetization directions at the domain wall center . since the two directions are parallel and anti - parallel to @xmath27 , the effective field either stabilizes or destabilizes the corresponding bloch domain wall structures [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dw - structures](d ) ] . recalling that the conventional spin torques produced by the current tend to shift@xcite @xmath44 away from the low energy values ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) , the deeper energy valley implies an enhanced threshold current density to escape the valley .",
    "since the walker breakdown occurs when @xmath44 can not remain stationary , the walker breakdown threshold current density becomes the larger of the two , which is larger than the walker breakdown threshold value without @xmath27 .     and in ( b ) , it points along @xmath47 .",
    "panel ( c ) shows the domain wall energy as a function of the domain wall tilting angle @xmath44 without the effective field @xmath48 .",
    "panel ( d ) shows the energy with the effective field assuming that @xmath49 is positive and @xmath27 prefers @xmath45 . ]",
    "another interesting feature of the experiment@xcite is that contrary to previous experiments,@xcite which report domain wall motion along the electron flow direction , ref .",
    "reports domain wall motion _ against _ the electron flow . within the scope of the conventional theories,@xcite",
    "the reversed domain wall motion implies negative @xmath50 , where @xmath25 is the polarization of the current and @xmath51 is the dimensionless coefficient of the non - adiabatic spin transfer torque .",
    "all of the qualitative feature of the experiment@xcite would be explained if there were an @xmath27 that gives walker breakdown threshold enhancement , negative @xmath50 for reversed motion , and @xmath52 for velocity enhancement ( @xmath53 is the gilbert damping constant ) .",
    "further measurements@xcite on the same pt(3",
    "nm)/co(0.6  nm)/alo@xmath21(1.6  nm ) system reveal a problem in this simple theoretical picture .",
    "based on measurements of bipolar switching in a tilted field , the authors conclude that the switching is due the additional presence of a damping - like torque along @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the damping - like torque is either parallel or anti - parallel to the nonadiabatic stt at the domain wall center and thus modifies the domain wall velocity.@xcite a recent theoretical study@xcite demonstrates that high @xmath37 _ against _ electron flow direction is possible ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dw - velocity ] ) even when both @xmath25 and @xmath51 are positive and @xmath55 is smaller than 1 , if both the field - like torque @xmath56 and the damping - like torque @xmath57 $ ] are sufficiently large .     as a function of the current density @xmath58 .",
    "the dotted line gives the prediction of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation when the current generates only the conventional ( adiabatic and nonadiabatic ) spin transfer torques and the solid line the prediction when the current also generates field - like and damping - like torques .",

    "et al._@xcite estimate that the spin hall contribution@xcite to the damping - like torque is not strong enough to explain the bipolar switching and conclude that the damping - like torque arises mainly from the rashba spin - orbit coupling , based on the observation that the efficiency of the bi - polar switching increases with the magnetic anisotropy of the cobalt layer and the oxidation of the aluminum layer .",
    "calculations@xcite confirm that the rashba spin - orbit coupling can give rise to the damping - like torque .",
    "note however that the spin hall contribution and the rashba spin - orbit coupling contribution to the damping - like torque have exactly the same structure , making the distinction difficult . in this",
    "regard , recent micromagnetic calculations@xcite show that the spin hall effect and the rashba spin - orbit coupling contributions give qualitatively different domain wall motion if there is no field - like torque as might be expected if the spin hall effect is the dominant source of the effect . without the field - like torque ,",
    "the domain wall motion at high current densities is along the electron flow direction ( if @xmath69 ) whereas with the strong field - like torque , the domain wall motion against the electron flow is possible even for @xmath70 ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : dw - velocity ] ) .",
    "in contrast to miron _",
    "et al_. s interpretation,@xcite liu _",
    "et al._@xcite conclude that the damping - like torque in pt(2.0  nm)/co(0.6  nm)/al(1.6  nm ) arises mainly from the spin hall effect in pt and the rashba spin - orbit coupling contribution is negligible .",
    "as evidence for the latter conclusion , they report that the ratio between the current - induced effective field along @xmath31 and the in - plane current density is more than 75 times smaller than the corresponding ratio in ref .  .",
    "a third experiment@xcite on a similar system pt(3.0  nm)/co(0.6  nm)/alo@xmath21(1.8  nm ) found that this ratio is about 3.4 times smaller than the ratio reported in ref .  .",
    "experiments@xcite that measure the field - like torque on ta(1.0  nm)/co@xmath17fe@xmath17b@xmath18(1.0  nm)/mgo(2.0  nm ) find that the ratio of the effective field to the current is about 23  % of the corresponding ratio in pt / co / alo@xmath21 as reported in ref .  .",
    "interestingly , the current - induced effective field in the ta / cofeb / mgo system is along @xmath47 and thus opposite to the corresponding direction in the pt / co / alo@xmath21 system if the ta and mgo layers in the ta / cofeb / mgo system are matched with pt and alo@xmath21 layers in the pt / co / alo@xmath21 system , respectively .",
    "it was also reported that the torque to current ratio decreases by more than an order of magnitude when the thickness of the co@xmath17fe@xmath17b@xmath18 layer in the ta / cofeb / mgo system increases slightly from 1.0  nm to 1.2  nm .",
    "the thickness dependence was investigated systematically@xcite for the two wedge systems , ta(@xmath71)/co@xmath18fe@xmath72b@xmath18(1  nm)/mgo(2  nm ) and ta(1  nm)/co@xmath18fe@xmath72b@xmath18(@xmath73)/mgo(2  nm ) . when the ta layer thickness @xmath71 changes by 1  nm , the effective field along the @xmath31 direction changes its magnitude by nearly two orders of magnitude . for small @xmath74  nm , the sign of the effective field is opposite to that in the larger @xmath71 regime and agrees with the sign of the pt / co / alo@xmath21 system.@xcite the damping - like effective field along the @xmath75 direction is also sensitive to @xmath71 with the sign change at @xmath76 0.5  nm .",
    "the sign change of the damping - like effective fields is interpreted as an evidence of competition between rashba spin - orbit coupling and spin hall effect.@xcite    measurements of current - driven domain wall motion in multi - layer structures containing non - magnetic heavy metal layers and ferromagnetic layers but without oxide layers@xcite are reported .",
    "the motion is also very sensitive to layer thicknesses.@xcite the domain wall velocity can be up to almost 1  km / s in certain multi - layer structures with the pt layer thickness of about 1  nm but changes very quickly as the pt thickness varies .",
    "interestingly , very high domain wall speed ( @xmath77 1  km / s ) are observed only when the domain wall moves against the electron flow , implying that the origin of the reversed domain wall motion is probably correlated with the mechanism behind very high domain wall speed .",
    "several other experiments@xcite also report reversed domain wall motion in ultrathin multi - layer systems containing pt layers .",
    "the analysis of domain wall motion described above considers four current induced torques , the the adiabatic and non - adiabatic spin - transfer torques and two torques , damping - like and field - like , that depend on the layer structure of the device .",
    "the first two torques depend on the gradient of the magnetization but are determined by bulk properties .",
    "the last two are independent of the gradient of the magnetization .",
    "other possibilities that depend on the gradient of the magnetization and the layer structure are allowed by symmetry@xcite and may be important for the dynamics .",
    "in addition , recent calculations@xcite suggest that a current - independent torque due to the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction@xcite might provide an alternate mechanism for stabilizing a moving domain wall above the nominal walker - breakdown field . in this paper",
    "we only consider the current - induced torques that are independent of the gradient of the magnetization .",
    "to explore possible mechanisms for the torques operative in these systems , we develop semiclassical models that allow for easy exploration of parameter space .",
    "we use a boltzmann equation approach and the simpler drift - diffusion approach .",
    "the boltzmann equation is better suited to describe in - plane transport but the drift - diffusion approach is simpler and provides a useful language to describe the physics .",
    "the boltzmann equation approach developed by camley and barna@xcite is the simplest model that describes current - in - the - plane ( cip ) giant - magnetoresistance ( gmr ) . in the boltzmann equation ,",
    "the variables are the distribution functions .",
    "the distribution function accounts for electrons moving in all directions even though the total current only points in a single direction .",
    "this generality allows the approach to describe the flow of spins between the layers even though the current flows in the plane of the interfaces .",
    "the drift - diffusion approach of valet and fert@xcite is based on integrating the distribution function in the boltzmann equation to derive transport equations that depend on the densities and currents .",
    "it has had wide success describing current - perpendicular - to - the - plane ( cpp ) gmr , but does not describe cip gmr .",
    "it fails because it does not describe the flow of spin currents between the layers when the current flows in the plane of the layers .",
    "however , this limitation may be less important in the bilayer systems of interest here . in materials with strong spin - orbit coupling , like pt , spin currents do flow perpendicular to the charge current because of the spin hall effect@xcite so that the drift - diffusion approach does qualitatively describe the physics .",
    "however , we compare the two approaches below , and show that the drift - diffusion approach differs quantitatively from the boltzmann equation for similar reasons to its qualitative failure for cip gmr .",
    "reference   describes the matrix boltzmann equation we use in this paper .",
    "it is a generalization of the model used to describe cip gmr,@xcite and is based on a very simplified model for the electronic structure .",
    "we treat all fermi surfaces as spherical and as having the same fermi wavevector .",
    "this approach ignores the details of the fermi surfaces , which are undoubtedly important for specific systems , particularly when including spin - orbit coupling .",
    "however , the scattering mechanisms are both unknown and uncharacterized , so we feel that it is appropriate to consider models in which scattering rates and other physical processes are parameterized and the details of the electronic structure are neglected for simplicity . by performing appropriate integrals over the distribution function , the boltzmann equation can be transformed into a drift - diffusion equation like that given in ref .  .",
    "the parameterized processes in the boltzmann equation then have a simple connection to those in the drift - diffusion equation .",
    "one such process that we include through parameterization is the spin - dependent conductivity in the ferromagnetic layer .",
    "we model the spin dependence by using spin - dependent scattering rates .",
    "such spin - dependent scattering is physically sensible as it is believed to play a bigger role in the polarization of the current in these materials than the electronic structure itself .",
    "for example , in co and ni , the current is expected to be dominated by majority carriers , even though there are more minority carriers at the fermi surface . in the drift diffusion model",
    ", the spin - dependent scattering leads to a different conductivity for the majority electrons @xmath78 than the minority electrons @xmath79 .",
    "this difference is parameterized in terms of the spin polarization of the current , defined through @xmath80 .",
    "the drift - diffusion transport equations in the ferromagnet are @xmath81 where @xmath10 is the charge current density , and @xmath82 is the tensor spin current density where the first index is the spatial component and the second index the spin component .",
    "@xmath83 is the electrochemical potential , such that negatively charged electrons diffuse against the gradient giving an overall positive sign for the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dd_fmc ] ) .",
    "similarly @xmath84 is the spin chemical potential , which is a vector along the direction of the spin accumulation , and the unit vector @xmath85 is the direction of the magnetization .",
    "the minus sign in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dd_fmc ] ) arises because majority electron spins are aligned opposite to the magnetization .",
    "these two signs are typical of possible sources of confusion in this subject matter .",
    "they arise because with the charge on the electron is negative and angular momenta and moments are in opposite directions .",
    "the equality of the fermi surfaces would also allow for perfect transmission of electrons across the interface between the materials . in the boltzmann equation",
    ", we include spin - dependent reflection by the addition of a spin - dependent sheet potential ( delta function ) at the interface .",
    "choosing the strength of this delta function allows us to tune the spin - dependent interface resistance to any arbitrary value.@xcite in the drift - diffusion approach , the spin - dependent reflection becomes a spin - dependent interface resistance or conductance as used in the closely related circuit theory.@xcite    while the overall structure of the boltzmann equation approach is the same as that published earlier , there are some modifications .",
    "one difference is the treatment of dephasing . in a ferromagnet ,",
    "spins on different parts of the fermi surface precess at different rates and travel with different velocities .",
    "these differences , combined with scattering between different parts of the fermi surface , cause the precessing spins to rapidly become out of phase with each other.@xcite in ref .",
    ", the transverse spin accumulation and current are forced to zero in the ferromagnet to account for this dephasing of the transverse spin population . here , we allow for transverse spin accumulation in the ferromagnet but build in rapid spin precession and explicitly account for the processes that cause dephasing .",
    "the simplified model of the fermi surfaces that we use can lead to underestimation of dephasing processes .",
    "we have tested this approximation by adding an explicit dephasing term .",
    "while such a term quantitatively changes the spin accumulation in the ferromagnet , we find that it does not change the calculated torques .",
    "the same dephasing process is absent in a drift - diffusion model but can be included by adding an explicit dephasing term . in this approximation ,",
    "the steady - state continuity equations in the ferromagnet are @xmath86_j \\label{eq : spincont}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the spin accumulation @xmath87 is proportional to the spin chemical potential @xmath88 and the precession time @xmath89 is related to the exchange splitting between the magnetization and the spin accumulation . repeated indices are summed over . the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spincont ] ) is the precession in the exchange field , the second term is the spin flip scattering that reduces all components of the spin accumulation , and the last term is the dephasing that reduces only the parts of the spin accumulation transverse to the magnetization . setting the transverse spin accumulation to zero , as done in earlier boltzmann equation calculations@xcite and in magnetoelectronic circuit theory,@xcite is equivalent to taking the limit that the dephasing time goes to zero .",
    "both the size of the spin hall effect and its underlying mechanism are controversial .",
    "the theory for the spin hall effect is related to that for the anomalous hall effect , a subject that has been controversial for decades.@xcite measurements of the spin hall angle ( the ratio of spin hall and charge conductivities ) for various materials span a range of values .",
    "part of the variation may result from the sensitivity of the extraction of the spin hall angle from experimental data to other material parameters needed to model the experiments.@xcite measurements@xcite show that the spin hall effect in ta is bigger and of the opposite sign of that in pt , in agreement with previous calculations.@xcite the agreement between these trends in theory and experiment argues for an intrinsic origin of the effect .",
    "however , the calculated spin hall conductivity for pt appears to be approximately an order of magnitude too small in comparison to the measured value .",
    "spin hall angles of approximately the right order of magnitude have been computed@xcite for the extrinsic contributions of various impurities in cu and au .    with this uncertainty in the mechanism for the spin hall effect ,",
    "we use the form of scattering appropriate for the extrinsic skew scattering contribution for computational simplicity . in the boltzmann equation , we include skew scattering as described by engel et al.@xcite but generalize their results to include scattering that leads to the inverse spin hall effect in addition to the scattering that gives rise to the spin hall effect .",
    "these scattering terms connect the current with a perpendicular spin current and vice versa .",
    "both our approach and the earlier work@xcite neglect the scattering processes that couple spin currents to spin currents moving in other directions .",
    "such process contribute to spin relaxation , which we include as a phenomenological spin flip scattering process .",
    "details of the scattering and the default parameters we use are given in appendix  [ app : be_scatt ] .",
    "in the non - magnetic material , the explicit forms of the charge and spin currents in the drift - diffusion approximation we use are@xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the conductivity , @xmath92 is the spin hall conductivity coupling the spin and charge currents to the charge and spin potentials , and @xmath93 is the levi - civita symbol . as with the boltzmann equation ,",
