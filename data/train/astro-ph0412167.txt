    "the stellar mass of galaxies at the present epoch and the build - up of stellar mass over cosmic time has become the focus of intense research in the past few years .",
    "generally , this kind of work relies on fits of multi - color photometry to a grid of composite stellar population ( csp ) models to determine a stellar mass - to - light ratio , since large and complete spectroscopic samples of galaxies ( at @xmath22 ) are not yet available .    in the local universe",
    ", results on the stellar mass function ( mf ) of galaxies were published using the new generation of wide - angle surveys in the optical ( sloan digital sky survey ; sdss , @xcite ; 2df , @xcite ) and near - infrared ( two micron all sky survey ; 2mass , @xcite ) . @xcite combined data from 2mass and 2df to derive the local stellar mf , @xcite used the sdss and 2mass to the same end .    at @xmath23 ,",
    "a number of authors studied the stellar mass density as a function of redshift @xcite reaching @xmath24 .",
    "it appears that by @xmath24 , about 30% of the local stellar mass density has been assembled in galaxies , and at @xmath25 , roughly half of the local stellar mass density is in place .",
    "this seems to be in broad agreement with measurements of the star formation rate density over the same redshift range .",
    "others investigated the evolution of the mf of galaxies @xcite to @xmath9 , finding a similar decline in the normalization of the mf .",
    "however , it is possible that galaxies evolve differently in number density depending on their morphology .    in this letter",
    ", we extend the measurement of the stellar mf and its integral , the total stellar mass density , to @xmath26 .",
    "we describe the data set in sect .",

    "we assume @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "this work is based on data from two deep field surveys having multicolor photometry and rich followup spectroscopy , the fors deep field ( fdf ; @xcite ) covering the ubgrizjks bands in 40 arcmin@xmath29 and the goods - s / cdfs field @xcite covering the ubvrijhks bands in 50 arcmin@xmath29 .",
    "this sample is identical to the one used in @xcite to study the global star formation rate to @xmath26 .",
    "the fdf photometric catalog is published in @xcite and we use the i - band selected subsample covering the deepest central region of the field as described in @xcite .",
    "this catalog lists 5557 galaxies down to @xmath30 .",
    "the latter also discusses the i - band selection and shows that this catalog misses at most 10% of the objects found in ultra - deep k - band observations found by @xcite .",
    "photometric redshifts for the fdf are calibrated against 362 spectroscopic redshifts up to @xmath26 and have a accuracy of with only @xmath31% outliers . the method and this calibration",
    "are presented and discussed in @xcite .    our k - band selected catalog for the goods - s / cdfs field",
    "is based on the publicly available 8 @xmath32 arcmin@xmath29 j , h , ks isaac images , taken at eso / vlt with seeing in the range @xmath33 .",
    "the u and i images are from eso goods / eis public survey , while the b v r images are taken from the garching - bonn deep survey .",
    "these datasets are extensively discussed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the data for the goods field were analyzed in a very similar way to the data of the fdf .",
    "the objects were detected in the k - band images closely following the procedure used for the fdf i - band detection . a detailed description of the procedure as well as the catalogs can be found in salvato et al .  ( 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "we detect 3367 sources in the k - band for which we measure fixed aperture and kron - like total magnitudes in all bands .",
    "of these , 2 objects are detected only in k , and 36 objects are detected only in the ks , h , and j band images .",
    "number counts match the literature values down to @xmath34 , which is the completeness limit of the catalog .",
    "we computed photometric redshifts using the same method and sed template spectra as for the fdf .",
    "a comparison with the spectroscopic redshifts of the vimos team and the fors2 spectra shows that the photometric redshifts have an accuracy @xmath35 .",
    "we derive stellar masses ( the mass locked up in stars ) by comparing multi - color photometry to a grid of stellar population synthesis models covering a wide range in parameters , especially star formation histories ( sfhs ) .",
    "this method is described in detail and compared against spectroscopic and dynamical mass estimates in drory , bender , & hopp @xcite , hence we only briefly outline the method here .",
    "we base our model grid on the @xcite models .",
    "we parameterize the possible sfhs by a two - component model , a main component with a smooth analytical sfh modulated by a burst of star formation .",
    "the main component is parameterized by a sfh of the form @xmath36 , with @xmath37 $ ]  gyr and a metallicity of @xmath38 } < 0.3 $ ] . the age , @xmath39 , ( defined as the time since star formation began ) is allowed to vary between 0.5  gyr and the age of the universe at the object s redshift .",
    "this component is linearly combined with a burst modeled as a 100  myr old constant star formation rate episode of solar metallicity .",
    "we restrict the burst fraction , @xmath40 , to the range @xmath41 in mass ( higher values of @xmath40 are degenerate and unnecessary since this case is covered by models with a young main component ) .",
    "we adopt a salpeter imf truncated at 0.1 and 100  @xmath7  for both components .",

    "[ f : mz],width=302 ]    additionally , both components are allowed to exhibit a different and variable amount of extinction by dust .",
    "this takes into account the fact that young stars are found in dusty environments and that the starlight from the galaxy as a whole may be reddened by a ( geometry dependent ) different amount .",
    "in fact , @xcite find that the balmer decrement in the sdss sample is independent of inclination , which , on the other hand , is driving global extinction ( ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ) .",
    "we compute the full likelihood distribution on a grid in this 6-dimensional parameter space ( @xmath43 } , t , a_v^1 , \\beta , a_v^2 $ ] ) , the likelihood of each model being @xmath44 . to compute the likelihood distribution of @xmath45 , we weight the @xmath45  of each model by its likelihood and marginalize over all parameters .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath45  is obtained from the width of this distribution , which is on average between @xmath46 and @xmath47  dex at 68% confidence level .",
    "the uncertainty in mass has a weak dependence on mass ( increasing with lower @xmath48 photometry ) and much of the variation is in spectral type : early - type galaxies have more tightly constrained masses than late types . at high redshift , however , the uncertainty in @xmath45  grows as objects drop - out in the blue bands and stellar populations become younger : the typical uncertainty at @xmath49 is 0.6  dex and becomes as large as 1  dex at the highest redshifts we probe .    in fig.[f :",
    "mz ] we show the distribution of galaxies in the mass vs.  redshift plane for the fdf ( squares ) and goods - s ( triangles ) . in addition , we code the age of each galaxy ( using the best - fitting model ) in colors ranging from blue for young ( age @xmath42  gyr ) to red for old stellar populations ( age @xmath50  gyr ) .",
    "the distribution of objects from the @xmath3-selected goods - s sample is very similar to the distribution of the @xmath1-selected fdf down to the completeness limit of the goods - s sample , which is @xmath31  dex shallower in limiting mass .",
    "this indicates that present optical and near - ir surveys are unlikely to have missed a substantial population of massive objects , with the possible exception of heavily dust - enshrouded sources which may escape detection in both optical and near - ir surveys .",
    "a striking feature of fig.[f : mz ] is that the most massive galaxies harbor the oldest stellar populations at all redshifts .",
    "there always exist galaxies which are old ( relative to the age of the universe at each redshift ) but less massive , yet the most massive objects at each redshift are never among the youngest .",
    "[ f : mf ] shows the @xmath51-weighted mass function in seven redshift bins from @xmath52 to @xmath18 . for comparison",
    ", we also show the local mass function @xcite and the mfs to @xmath53 of munics @xcite and to @xmath11 by the k20 survey @xcite .",
    "the mf of objects from the @xmath3-selected goods - s sample is very similar to that of the @xmath1-selected fdf down to the completeness limit of the goods - s sample ( with the exception of a possible slightly lower normalization at @xmath54 by about 10% to 20% ) .",
    "this shows that near - ir selected surveys at high redshift essentially detect the more massive objects of the same principal population as do optically ( @xmath1-band ) selected surveys ( see also sect .  3 and fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "it remains to be seen what fraction of massive galaxies ( and total stellar mass density ) might be hidden in dusty starbursts which appear as sub - mm galaxies .    in our lowest redshift bin , @xmath55",
    ", the mf follows the local mf very well .",
    "the depth of the fdf ( @xmath30 ) allows us to extend the faint end of the mf down to @xmath6  @xmath7 , a decade lower in mass than in @xcite , with no change of slope .",
    "furthermore , the faint end slope is consistent with the local value of @xmath56 at least to @xmath9 .",
    "our mass function also agrees very well with the munics and k20 results at @xmath57 .",
    "the mf seems to evolve in a regular way at least up to @xmath11 with the normalization decreasing by 50% to @xmath12 and by 70% to @xmath13 , with the largest change occurring at masses of @xmath58  @xmath7 .",
    "these likely progenitors of todays @xmath15 galaxies are found in much smaller numbers above @xmath11 .",
    "however , we note that massive galaxies with @xmath16  @xmath7are present even to the largest redshift we probe ( albeit in smaller numbers ) . beyond @xmath11",
    "the evolution becomes more rapid .",
    "it is hard to say whether the difference between the fdf and the goods - s field visible at @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ f : mf ] is significant .",
    "in fact , @xcite find not much difference in the rest - frame uv luminosity function in the very same dataset .",
    "we think it might be related to the shallower near - ir data in the fdf compared to goods - s .",
    "less reliable information on the rest - frame optical colors at young mean ages might in fact lead to an overestimation of the stellar mass .",
    "this would also explain why the two mfs become similar again at even higher @xmath5 when the near - ir data in goods - s reach their limit , too .",
    "this would mean that the mass density in the fdf at @xmath54 might be overestimated ( see below ) .",
    ", width=302 ]      we compute the total stellar mass density by directly summing up contributions from all objects in both fields ( we obtain very similar values by means of fitting schechter functions to the data in fig .  [",
    "f : mf ] ) . we find that the stellar mass density at @xmath12 is 50% of the local value as determined by @xcite . at @xmath13 , 25% of the local mass density",
    "is assembled , and at @xmath17 and @xmath18 we find that at least 15% and 5% of the mass in stars is in place , respectively .",
    "[ f : md ] shows the results from both fields separately , however .",
    "we also show the integral of the star formation rate determined by @xcite as a dotted line .",
    "furthermore , the dashed line shows the same quantity determined from the rest - frame uv luminosity function of in same dataset used here @xcite .",
    "we find these measurements in agreement with each other , and with the mass densities derived here and in the literature before .",
    "however , the mass densities do show considerable scatter especially at redshifts above @xmath9 .",
    "however , as discussed above , the mass density in the fdf might be overestimated , hence reducing the scatter between our two fields .",
    "the fdf also lies above the average literature values in the redshift range in question , while the goods - s data seem to be in better agreement with previous measurements .",
    "the fact that the stellar mass densities and the integrated star formation rates give consistent results is encouraging . however , dust - enshrouded starbursts at high redshift would be missing from both the sfr and the mf .",
    "however , if the number density of massive sub - mm galaxies derived by @xcite of @xmath60 at @xmath61 is typical of these systems , they do not contribute significantly to the mass density at these redshifts ( see below and fig.[f : nd ] ) .    finally , fig .",
