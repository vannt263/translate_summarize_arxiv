    "knowledge on the density dependence of the symmetry energy is crucial to understand the structure of exotic nuclei , dynamics of heavy - ion collisions , and many important issues in nuclear astrophysics such as neutron star cooling and supernova explosive @xcite .",
    "while great progress has been made to constrain the symmetry energy at low densities @xcite , the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy is divergent widely from interpreting fopi data @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 ratio was found to be a sensitive probe to the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy by several transport models @xcite .",
    "in fact for pion production , at lower beam energies effects of symmetry energy and in - medium effect may both become larger @xcite .",
    "it is thus necessary to do a comparative study of effects of the in - medium @xmath0 cross section and the effects of the symmetry energy on pion production in heavy - ion collisions at lower beam energies . and these experimental studies will become possible at facilities that offer fast radioactive beams , such as nscl and frib in the us , fair in germany , or ribf in japan",
    "in this study , we adopt the semi - classical transport model ibuu04 , in which the isospin - dependent initial neutron and proton density distributions of the projectile and target are obtained by using the skyrme - hartree - fock with skyrme @xmath5 ( sm ) force parameters @xcite . and an isospin- and momentum - dependent mean - field single nucleon potential is also used , i.e. , @xmath6 where @xmath7 for neutrons(protons ) , @xmath8 is the isospin asymmetry , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 denote neutron and proton densities , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are all given in ref .",
    "@xmath18 is the phase - space distribution function at coordinate * r * and momentum * p*. different @xmath19 parameters can be used to mimic different forms of the symmetry energy . in this model , reaction channels on pion production and absorption are @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents @xmath22 or @xmath23 resonances .",
    "the experimental free - space nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) scattering cross section and the in - medium @xmath0 cross section can be used optionally .",
    "for the later , we use the isospin - dependent in - medium @xmath0 elastic cross section , which is from the scaling model according to nucleon effective masses @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the reduced masses of the colliding nucleon pair in free space and medium , respectively . and the effective mass of nucleon in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is given by @xmath27 from the definition and eq .",
    "( 1 ) , it is seen that the effective mass depends not only on density and asymmetry of nuclear matter , but also the momentum of nucleon @xcite . for the inelastic cross section we use the experimental data from free space @xmath0 collision since",
    "the in - medium inelastic @xmath0 cross section is still very controversial .",
    "the total and differential cross sections for all other particles are taken either from experimental data or obtained by using the detailed balance formula .",
    "the isospin dependent phase - space distribution functions of the particles involved are solved by using the test - particle method numerically .",
    "the isospin - dependence of pauli blockings for fermions is also considered .",
    "[ t ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ density ] , the maximal baryon densities reached in @xmath1 collisions are about 1.5@xmath282 times saturation density at @xmath29=100 , 200 and 300 mev / nucleon .",
    "we can also see that the maximal baryon density reached increase with incident beam energy .",
    "however , existing time of supradensity matter becomes shorter with increase of beam energy .",
    "[ t ]    figure  [ ratiobeam ] shows effects of in - medium @xmath0 elastic scattering cross section on the @xmath4 ratio in central collision @xmath1 at @xmath29=100 , 150 , 200 , 250 , and 300 mev / nucleon , respectively . from fig .",
    "[ ratiobeam ] we can see that the value of @xmath4 ratio decreases with increase of beam energy , which is consistent with that in ref .",
    "this is partially because the production of pions is from repeated nucleon - nucleon collisions at higher beam energies , i.e. , a neutron converts a proton by producing @xmath30 and subsequent collisions of that proton can convert again to neutron by producing @xmath31 .",
    "more interestingly , one can see that the effects of in - medium @xmath0 elastic cross section on the value of @xmath4 ratio become larger and larger with decrease of beam energy . at lower beam energy",
    "100 mev / nucleon , effects of in - medium @xmath0 elastic cross section on the value of @xmath4 ratio can reach about 40% .",
    "when one changes @xmath0 elastic cross section , total @xmath0 collision number would also changes accordingly .",
    "as there is certain probability of inelastic process in total @xmath0 collision , @xmath0 inelastic collision is thus affected by @xmath0 elastic cross section . at high beam energy ,",
    "@xmath0 inelastic processes may be more than elastic processes .",
    "so elastic @xmath0 cross section should have small effects on pion production .",
    "but at low beam energy , pion production is via many @xmath0 scatterings , large number of @xmath0 elastic scatterings increases the whole @xmath0 scatterings , since there is certain probability of inelastic process in @xmath0 collision , pion production should be affected by @xmath0 elastic scatterings .",
    "[ t ]    [ htb ]    to see more clearly how the in - medium @xmath0 cross section affect @xmath4 ratio and effect of the symmetry energy on pion production , we plot evolution of pion meson production with different @xmath0 cross sections and symmetry energies .",
    "shown in figure  [ pion - t1 ] and figure  [ pion - t2 ] are time evolutions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 mesons with different symmetry energies ( x=0 , x=1 ) and different @xmath0 elastic scattering cross sections ( in - medium , free ) in the central collision @xmath1 at beam energies of 100 and 200 mev / nucleon , respectively . in both fig .",
    "[ pion - t1 ] and fig .",
    "[ pion - t2 ] , we can see that the effects of in - medium @xmath0 elastic scattering cross section on the @xmath31 production is larger than that of @xmath30 production . however , the effects of symmetry energy on the @xmath31 production is smaller than that of @xmath30 production .",
    "the reason of in - medium effects on the @xmath31 production is larger than that of @xmath30 production is that the reduction factor @xmath32 of @xmath33 ( proton - proton ) pair is smaller than that of @xmath34 ( neutron - neutron ) pair @xcite as well as @xmath33 @xmath35 collision mainly produce @xmath31 ( @xmath30 ) . and due to coulomb actions among protons , @xmath31 production is also less sensitive to the symmetry energy . in figure  [ pion - t1 ] and",
    "figure  [ pion - t2 ] , we can also see that for @xmath30 production , effects of in - medium @xmath0 cross section are smaller than that of symmetry energy whereas for @xmath31 production , effects of in - medium @xmath0 cross section are obviously larger than that of symmetry energy . and with increase of beam energy , effects of in - medium @xmath0 cross section become smaller .",
    "[ t ]    to see more clearly effects of in - medium @xmath0 elastic scattering cross section and symmetry energy on @xmath4 ratio , in fig .",
    "[ pionratio - t ] , we show time evolution of @xmath4 ratio with different symmetry energies and @xmath0 elastic scattering cross sections at beam energies of 100 and 200 mev / nucleon , respectively .",
    "we can clearly see that effects of in - medium @xmath0 cross section on the value of @xmath4 ratio are about 2 times larger than that of the symmetry energy at incident beam energy of 100 mev / nucleon .",
    "however , at incident beam energy of 200 mev / nucleon , effects of in - medium @xmath0 cross section on the value of @xmath4 ratio are almost equal to that of the symmetry energy .",
    "[ t ]    [ t ]    in order to reduce the effects of in - medium and retain effects of the symmetry symmetry on @xmath4 ratio , we calculate double ratio of @xmath4 using two reaction systems of neutron rich and neutron poor of same isotopes @xcite . shown in fig .",
    "[ doubleratio - t ] is time evolution of the double @xmath4 ratio from @xmath1 and @xmath36 .",
    "it is seen that effects of the in - medium @xmath0 cross section on the double @xmath4 ratio is about 30% , but effects of the symmetry energy is about 42% .",
    "however , from the top panel of fig .",
    "[ pionratio - t ] , we see that effects of the in - medium @xmath0 cross section on the @xmath4 ratio is about 50% , but effects of the symmetry energy is about 25% .",
    "thus the double ratio of @xmath4 from two reaction systems of neutron rich and neutron poor of same isotopes can indeed reduce uncertainties from in - medium properties of hadrons and keep the effects of symmetry energy . while from fig .",
    "[ doubleratio - t ] , we can see that even we use the double ratio of observable , effects of in - medium @xmath0 cross section are still very obvious .",
    "besides theoretical efforts @xcite and advanced method such as photon emission in heavy - ion collisions @xcite , we also simulated the double ratio of @xmath2 from two reaction systems ( with the same mass number of system but different isotopes ) @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , from fig .",
    "[ doubleratio - t1 ] one sees that effects of symmetry energy are kept but the effects of in - medium @xmath0 elastic scattering cross section are almost fully cancelled out .",
    "this is because the latter two neutron - rich and neutron - poor reaction systems have the same baryon number , evolutions and distributions of baryon density in the two reactions are almost the same .",
    "in summary , we studied effects of in - medium @xmath0 cross section and effects of symmetry energy on @xmath4 ratio at lower incident beam energies .",
    "we find that at lower incident beam energy , for @xmath4 ratio , effects of in - medium @xmath0 cross section are larger than that of symmetry energy .",
    "the double ratio of @xmath4 from reaction systems of neutron rich and neutron poor of same isotopes can not fully cancel out the effects of in - medium @xmath0 cross section .",
    "however , the double ratio of @xmath4 from reaction systems of neutron rich and neutron poor of different isotopes but same mass number of reaction system almost fully cancels out the effects of in - medium @xmath0 cross section .",
