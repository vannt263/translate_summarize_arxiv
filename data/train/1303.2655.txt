    "however , even at zams , the ice line is not increased much from the initial position at formation time .",

    "the effective temperature of such massive stars increases rapidly as they approach the main sequence , and stellar irradiation quickly becomes the dominant heating mechanism for their disks .",
    "since @xmath97 for massive stars is much less than disk lifetimes , any planet formation around massive star binaries will necessarily continue after they reach the main sequence . for the purposes of this study",
    ", i thus restrict my conclusions to binaries consisting of low to intermediate mass components , @xmath98 .",

    "these fractions represent lower limits because i conservatively choose the `` maximum '' ice line in each system .",
    "furthermore , a fraction of 80% is a conservative lower limit for unequal mass binaries since @xmath83 for the lowest mass ratio system i consider ( @xmath110 ) is approximately the same as that of the equal mass binary with component masses of @xmath111 .",
