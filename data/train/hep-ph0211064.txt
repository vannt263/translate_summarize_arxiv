    "it is well known that supersymmetric models with conserved @xmath2-parity contain one new stable particle which is a candidate for cold dark matter ( cdm ) @xcite .",
    "there are very strong constraints , however , forbidding the existence of stable or long lived particles which are not color and electrically neutral .",
    "strong and electromagnetically interacting lsps would become bound with normal matter forming anomalously heavy isotopes . indeed , there are very strong upper limits on the abundances , relative to hydrogen , of nuclear isotopes  @xcite , @xmath3 for 1 gev @xmath4 1 tev .",
    "a strongly interacting stable relic is expected to have an abundance @xmath5 with a higher abundance for charged particles .",
    "there are relatively few supersymmetric candidates which are not colored and are electrically neutral .",
    "the sneutrino @xcite is one possibility , but in the mssm , it has been excluded as a dark matter candidate by direct @xcite and indirect @xcite searches .",
    "in fact , one can set an accelerator based limit on the sneutrino mass from neutrino counting , @xmath6 44.7 gev @xcite . in this case , the direct relic searches in underground low - background experiments require @xmath6 20 tev  @xcite . another possibility is the gravitino which is probably the most difficult to exclude .",
    "i will concentrate on the remaining possibility in the mssm , namely the neutralinos .",
    "there are four neutralinos , each of which is a linear combination of the @xmath7 , neutral fermions @xcite : the wino @xmath8 , the partner of the 3rd component of the @xmath9 gauge boson ; the bino , @xmath10 , the partner of the @xmath11 gauge boson ; and the two neutral higgsinos , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in general , neutralinos can be expressed as a linear combination @xmath14 the solution for the coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 for neutralinos that make up the lsp can be found by diagonalizing the mass matrix ( w^3 , b , h^0_1,h^0_2 ) (    cccc m_2 & 0 & -g_2 v_1 & g_2 v_2   + 0 & m_1 & g_1 v_1 & -g_1 v_2   + -g_2 v_1 & g_1 v_1 & 0 & - + g_2 v_2 & -g_1 v_2 & - & 0    ) (    c w^3 + b + h^0_1 + h^0_2    ) where @xmath17 are the soft supersymmetry breaking u(1 ) ( su(2 ) ) gaugino mass terms .",
    "@xmath18 is the supersymmetric higgs mixing mass parameter and since there are two higgs doublets in the mssm , there are two vacuum expectation values , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "one combination of these is related to the @xmath21 mass , and therefore is not a free parameter , while the other combination , the ratio of the two vevs , @xmath22 , is free .",
    "the most general version of the mssm , despite its minimality in particles and interactions contains well over a hundred new parameters .",
    "the study of such a model would be untenable were it not for some ( well motivated ) assumptions .",
    "these have to do with the parameters associated with supersymmetry breaking .",
    "it is often assumed that , at some unification scale , all of the gaugino masses receive a common mass , @xmath23 .",
    "the gaugino masses at the weak scale are determined by running a set of renormalization group equations .",
    "similarly , one often assumes that all scalars receive a common mass , @xmath24 , at the gut scale ( though one may wish to make an exception for the higgs soft masses ) .",
    "these too are run down to the weak scale .",
    "the remaining supersymmetry breaking parameters are the trilinear mass terms , @xmath25 , which i will also assume are unified at the gut scale , and the bilinear mass term @xmath26 .",
    "there are , in addition , two physical cp violating phases which will not be considered here .",
    "the natural boundary conditions at the gut scale for the mssm would include @xmath18 , the two soft higgs masses ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) and @xmath26 in addition to @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . in this case , by running the rges down to a low energy scale , one would predict the values of @xmath29 , @xmath22 , and the higgs pseudoscalar mass , @xmath30 ( in addition to all of the sparticle masses ) . since @xmath29 is known , it is more useful to analyze supersymmetric models where @xmath29 is input rather than output .",
    "it is also common to treat @xmath22 as an input parameter .",
    "this can be done at the expense of shifting @xmath18 ( up to a sign ) and @xmath26 from inputs to outputs .",
    "when the supersymmetry breaking higgs soft masses are also unified at the gut scale ( and take the common value @xmath24 ) , the model is often referred to as the constrained mssm or cmssm .",
    "once these parameters are set , the entire spectrum of sparticle masses at the weak scale can be calculated .",
    "the relic abundance of lsp s is determined by solving the boltzmann equation for the lsp number density in an expanding universe .",
    "the technique @xcite used is similar to that for computing the relic abundance of massive neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the relic density depends on additional parameters in the mssm beyond @xmath31 , and @xmath22 .",
    "these include the sfermion masses , @xmath32 , as well as @xmath30 , all derived from @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath23 . to determine the relic density it is necessary to obtain the general annihilation cross - section for neutralinos . in much of the parameter space of interest ,",
    "the lsp is a bino and the annihilation proceeds mainly through sfermion exchange . because of the p - wave suppression associated with majorana fermions , the s - wave part of the annihilation cross - section is suppressed by the outgoing fermion masses .",
    "this means that it is necessary to expand the cross - section to include p - wave corrections which can be expressed as a term proportional to the temperature if neutralinos are in equilibrium .",
    "unless the neutralino mass happens to lie near near a pole , such as @xmath33 @xmath34 or @xmath35 , in which case there are large contributions to the annihilation through direct @xmath36-channel resonance exchange , the dominant contribution to the @xmath37 annihilation cross section comes from crossed @xmath38-channel sfermion exchange .",
    "annihilations in the early universe continue until the annihilation rate @xmath39 drops below the expansion rate given by the hubble parameter , @xmath40 . for particles which annihilate through approximate weak scale interactions",
    ", this occurs when @xmath41 .",
    "subsequently , the relic density of neutralinos is fixed relative to the number of relativistic particles .",
    "as noted above , the number density of neutralinos is tracked by a boltzmann - like equation , = -3r r n - v ( n^2 - n_0 ^ 2 ) [ rate ] where @xmath42 is the equilibrium number density of neutralinos . by defining the quantity @xmath43",
    ", we can rewrite this equation in terms of @xmath44 , as = m _ ( 4 45 ^3 g_n n ) ^-1/2 v ( f^2 - f_0 ^ 2 ) [ rate2 ] where @xmath45 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom . the solution to this equation at late times ( small @xmath46 )",
    "yields a constant value of @xmath47 , so that @xmath48 . the final relic density expressed as a fraction of the critical energy density",

    "the subscript @xmath47 refers to values at freeze - out , i.e. , when annihilations cease .",

    "values much smaller than @xmath56 seem to be disfavoured by earlier analyses of structure formation in the cdm framework , so we restrict our attention to @xmath57 .",
