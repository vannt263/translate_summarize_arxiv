    "in the last twenty - five years , there has been much interest in the study of @xmath0-meson production in @xmath2 and @xmath1 collisions at hadron colliders , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "first measurements were done in the late eighties by the ua1 collaboration at the cern @xmath3 collider @xcite operating at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath4  tev .",
    "later measurements were performed by the cdf and d0 collaborations at the fermilab tevatron in @xmath5 collisions at @xmath6  tev @xcite and at @xmath7  tev @xcite .",
    "recently , the cms @xcite , atlas @xcite , and lhcb @xcite collaborations at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) published their results for inclusive @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 meson production in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath11  tev .",
    "in all these measurements , the differential cross sections @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 meson , integrated over specific rapidity ( @xmath14 ) regions , or @xmath15 integrated over @xmath16 were obtained . while the cms and atlas data were obtained at central rapidities , lhcb performed measurements at forward rapidities , @xmath17 .",
    "actually , only few measurements were able to explore the small-@xmath13 range down to @xmath18 , namely those by cdf @xcite and the two by lhcb @xcite . in all other data ,",
    "the cut @xmath19  gev was imposed . a unified theoretical description of these data , which covers both the very small and the large @xmath13 range , requires special efforts , which we shall undertake in this paper .    on the theoretical side",
    ", it is generally accepted that for the treatment of @xmath0-meson production at small @xmath13 values , as well as for the calculation of the integrated cross section including the small-@xmath13 range , i.e. , with @xmath20 of order @xmath21 and below , where @xmath22 is the @xmath23-quark mass , one should use the so - called massive scheme or fixed - flavor - number scheme ( ffns ) @xcite , in which the number of active quark flavors in the initial state is limited to @xmath24 , and the @xmath23 quark appears with explicit mass dependence only in the final state . in this case , the @xmath23 quark is treated as a heavy particle in the final state and not as a parton in the initial ( anti)proton .    in the large-@xmath13 region , characterized by @xmath25 , the so - called massless scheme or zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( zm - vfns ) is considered to be appropriate .",
    "this is the conventional parton model approach , where the @xmath23 quark is considered massless like any other parton .",
    "the @xmath23 quark is also treated as an incoming parton coming from the ( anti)proton leading to additional contributions from hard - scattering subprocesses besides those with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 quarks or the gluon ( @xmath30 ) in the initial state .",
    "although this approach can be used as soon as the factorization scales @xmath31 and @xmath32 associated with the initial- and final - state singularities are above the starting scale of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , its predictions are reliable only in the large-@xmath13 region , @xmath25 , where terms of the order of @xmath33 can be safely neglected .",
    "a next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculation in this scheme automatically resums leading and next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) terms . at the same time , all non - logarithmic terms through @xmath34 relative to the born approximation are retained for @xmath35 . with the conventional choice of renormalization and factorization scales , @xmath36 with @xmath37 ,",
    "the results are dominated by contributions from the @xmath23-quark pdf down to @xmath38 .    on the other hand , the general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( gm - vfns )",
    "provides a theoretical framework which combines the ffns and the zm - vfns .",
    "the zm - vfns is extended into the intermediate-@xmath13 range by retaining the mass - dependent terms of the ffns . with",
    "the conventional choice of scales indicated above , the results in this scheme are also dominated by the contributions of the @xmath23-quark pdf down to @xmath38 . as a consequence , there is no smooth transition from the gm - vfns at large @xmath13 values to the ffns in the small-@xmath13 range , and the gm - vfns fails to describe the small-@xmath13 cdf and lhcb data .",
    "the dominance of contributions with @xmath23-quarks in the initial state at small @xmath13 values is linked to the fact that this part is treated in the massless scheme , as a calculation of the @xmath23-quark - initiated subprocesses in a scheme with massive partons ( like the acot scheme @xcite ) is not available for hadroproduction .",
    "the cross section with massless partons is , however , divergent for @xmath39 . for a realistic description",
    ", we thus have to find a way to eliminate or modify this contribution in the small-@xmath13 region . in this paper",
    ", we shall develop an approach to modify the gm - vfns in such a way that it matches the ffns with the exact @xmath22 dependence by a suitable choice of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we shall study how these modifications can lead to a better agreement with presently available experimental data at small @xmath13 values .",
    "the content of this paper is as follows . in section  2",
    ", we introduce our strategy for the transition to the ffns and compare our predictions with the cdf @xcite and the lhcb @xcite data .",
    "we shall also present results to be compared with measurements by the atlas collaboration @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  3 .",
    "in this section , we shall discuss a viable unified framework of theoretical predictions for inclusive @xmath0-meson production at small and large @xmath13 values .",
    "we shall compare with the cross section distributions @xmath12 measured by cdf @xcite and lhcb @xcite . throughout this paper , take the @xmath23-quark pole mass to be @xmath40  gev , evaluate @xmath41 at nlo with @xmath42 and @xmath43  mev if @xmath44 and with @xmath45 and @xmath46  mev if @xmath47 , and use the cteq6.6 m proton pdfs @xcite unless otherwise stated .",

    "we take the transition of @xmath23 and @xmath52 quarks to the observed @xmath0 mesons into account by using the branching fraction @xmath53 @xcite as an overall normalization factor .",

    "we notice , however , that the ffns and gm - vfns predictions approach each other at around @xmath65  gev , i.e.  4 to 5 times @xmath22 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show a similar comparison of the ffns and gm - vfns predictions for the case of the lhcb data @xcite .",

    "@xcite , we observe similar qualitative behaviors of the ffns and gm - vfns predictions and a transition point at about the same value of @xmath13 , namely @xmath67  gev .",
    "one should expect that a correct treatment of kinematic constraints due to the finite heavy - hadron mass is important , in particular at small @xmath13 values .",
    "however , there is no unique prescription to take into account the finite masses of the heavy quark and the heavy hadron at the same time .",
    "a prescription for including the heavy - hadron mass in connection with massless quarks based on the light - cone scaling variable was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we propose a generalization to the massive - quark case .",
    "this amounts to scaling the partonic cross section for the production of the massive quark @xmath68 , with mass @xmath69 , energy @xmath70 , and three - momentum @xmath71 , that initiates the formation of the heavy hadron @xmath72 , with mass @xmath73 , energy @xmath74 , and three - momentum @xmath75 , as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the light - cone scaling variable .",

    "[ fig1][fig3 ] suggest that the predictions of the ffns and the gm - vfns are very similar in the range 15  gev@xmath82  gev . in this range ,",
    "both theories are justified , with the ffns naturally extending to smaller @xmath13 values and the gm - vfns to larger @xmath13 values .",
    "therefore , one could designate a transition point @xmath83 at @xmath65  gev , say , where one switches from one scheme to the other @xcite .",
    "for practical purposes , this would require the knowledge of the pdfs in the scheme with @xmath42 active flavors up to @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "a naive prescription to combine the two schemes could be to use matching functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 $ ] to multiply the ffns and gm - vfns cross sections , respectively .",
    "such a prescription will , however , lead to a discontinuity in the combined cross section at @xmath87 , a property that is certainly unphysical .",
    "one could try to invent different ways to combine the two schemes by introducing some smooth matching function , e.g. , @xmath88 with @xmath89 @xcite , and imposing , schematically , the prescription @xmath90 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ffns}}$ ] .",
    "however , such an approach would introduce a new parameter , and it is unclear how theoretical uncertainties related to the choice of this parameter should be estimated .",
    "it will be helpful to take a closer look at the structure of the partonic cross sections in the gm - vfns .",
    "they involve subtraction terms needed to separate the large logarithms @xmath91 at fixed relative order @xmath92 .",
    "for example , the cross section of the partonic subprocess @xmath93 contains terms with large logarithms which can be written , schematically , as convolutions @xmath94 and @xmath95 with a partonic pdf @xmath96 and a partonic ff @xmath97 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for definitions and a precise formulation of the corresponding cross sections ) .",
    "these splitting functions are absorbed in the pdfs and ffs , respectively .",
    "the large logarithms subtracted in this way are added back by calculating the cross sections of the @xmath98 and @xmath99 subprocesses with a @xmath23-quark pdf and a @xmath100 ff , respectively .",
    "there are similar subtraction terms and corresponding contributions involving pdfs and ffs of light quarks and the gluon in other channels as well .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5a ] , we show numerical results for the subtraction terms needed in the @xmath101 channel ( see eqs .",
    "( 45)(53 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , using a linear scale for better visibility .",
    "their contribution is small , but not negligible , even at large @xmath13 values .",
    "specifically , the evaluations using the correct prescription with @xmath102 ( dashed line ) and the approximate one with @xmath35 ( full line ) are compared with each other .",
    "we observe from this that such mass effects are small and can not be responsible for the unphysical increase of the total result for @xmath103 towards small @xmath13 values .",
    "it is , of course , unavoidable that the subtracted terms differ from those added back in the pdfs and ffs .",
    "the subtractions are obtained at fixed order , @xmath34 in our case , while the pdfs and ffs contain the large logarithms resummed to all orders .",
    "formally , the differences are of higher order in @xmath92 .",
    "however , these higher - order terms are folded with cross sections calculated in the zm - vfns , and these cross sections are singular for @xmath104 . therefore , it is not surprising that the contributions with @xmath23 quarks in the initial state dominate at small @xmath13 values .    obviously , nlo cross sections of @xmath23-quark - initiated subprocesses that are convoluted with pdfs and ffs evolved at nlo contain terms singular for @xmath104 at one order beyond the subtracted terms .",
    "in fact , it would be a major task to derive the missing next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) subtraction terms .",
    "with such an extended version of the gm - vfns including nnlo subtractions , but still using partonic cross sections derived in the zm - vfns , the problem would be shifted to one order higher , but it remains to be seen whether the required cancellations of singular terms can be obtained with the required numerical precision .",
    "in addition , strictly speaking , the nnlo subtraction terms only make sense in combination with the fixed - order calculation at nnlo .",
    "otherwise , at large @xmath13 values , the nnlo subtraction terms and their nlo fixed - order counterparts do not cancel , and the zm - vfns is not recovered .    in turn , one could argue that @xmath23-quark - initiated processes evaluated with @xmath23-quark pdfs and ffs should be included in the gm - vfns at lo only .",
    "the predictions thus obtained @xcite exhibit better agreement with data in the medium-@xmath13 range , between 2 and 7  gev or so , but switching off these nlo terms is again not sufficient to completely eliminate a singular behavior for @xmath104 . moreover , and most importantly , numerical evaluations show that nlo corrections in the zero - mass part of the gm - vfns are essential at large @xmath13 values . therefore , we do not follow this option either .    instead",
    ", we try to exploit the freedom offered by the presence of @xmath57 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , parameters that are present anyway .",
    "their values are not determined by theory , but some choice has to be made , based on some reasonable , but ad - hoc physical argument .",
    "in fact , a judicious choice of scales can lead to a suppression of the potentially dangerous contributions from initial - state @xmath23 quarks .",
    "this exploits the fact that all commonly available pdf fits assume that the @xmath23-quark pdf is zero below some starting scale , usually chosen to be @xmath105 .",
    "the same is true for the ffs : the ff for the @xmath106 transition vanishes for @xmath107 .",

    "i.e.  the dglap evolutions of the pdfs and ffs are frozen below this scale . slightly below @xmath22 , @xmath120 with @xmath121 , since the @xmath23-quark pdf parametrization of the cteq6.6 m set , which we use here , vanishes only strictly below threshold . for our numerical evaluations ,",

    "this unavoidably introduces factorization scale parameters , which can not be predicted from theory .",
    "their choice must be based on physical arguments .",
    "we exploited the freedom in this choice to find a prescription that extends the reliability of nlo predictions in the gm - vfns down to small @xmath13 values . with scale parameters",
    "@xmath142 , it is possible to eliminate contributions from the heavy quark in the initial state .",
    "these contributions , dominated by the subprocess @xmath143 , are treated in the parton model with zero quark masses and would lead to an unphysical increase of the cross section for @xmath39 .",
    "we showed , however , that with a judicious choice of @xmath127 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , one can switch off these contributions in the small-@xmath13 range .",
    "our prescription leads to a modified gm - vfns yielding results in good agreement with recent data from the tevatron and lhc experiments .",
    "we thank i.  bierenbaum for help in checking some of our numerical calculations and j.  rojo for clarifying an issue related to the heavy - quark threshold used in the nnpdf pdfs @xcite .",
    "this work was supported in part by the german federal ministry for education and research bmbf through grant no .",
