    "observations of the galactic - centre ridge with the high - energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) have revealed a surprisingly intense diffuse tev emission , strongly correlated with the distribution of interstellar gas ( aharonian et al .",
    "this feature , along with the energy range accessible to hess ( @xmath0 gev ) , suggests that the dominant component of this diffuse emission is almost certainly due to the decay of neutral pions produced in hadronic cascades initiated via the scattering of relativistic cosmic rays with protons in the ambient medium ( see , e.g. , crocker et al .",
    "2005 ; ballantyne et al . 2007 ) .",
    "earlier hess observations of the galactic centre had already revealed the presence of several tev point sources , one of these ( hess j1745290 ) coincident with the supermassive black hole sagittarius a * ( aharonian et al . 2004 ) . a second nearby source ( about 1@xmath1or roughly 144 pc at that distance  toward positive longitude @xmath2 of the galactic centre )",
    "was identified with the supernova remnant / pulsar wind nebula g0.9 + 0.1 . with hess",
    "s unprecedented sensitivity , it has been possible to subtract these ( and other ) point sources from the overall map of this region , to search for the fainter , diffuse emission .",
    "the latter extends along the galactic plane for over 2@xmath1 , and is also spread out roughly 0.2@xmath1 in galactic latitude @xmath3 .    at the distance to the galactic centre ,",
    "an extension in latitude of @xmath4 corresponds to a scale height of about 30 pc , similar to that of giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) material in this region , as traced by its co and cs line emission ( see , e.g. , tsuboi et al .",
    "these data suggest that the galaxy s central region ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) contains up to @xmath7 of molecular gas , providing a rich target of overlapping clouds for the incoming cosmic rays ( see figure  1 ; the construction of this diagram is discussed in   2 below ) .    however , a simple cosmic - ray interpretation for the diffuse tev emission is problematic for several reasons .",
    "chief among these is the observed gamma - ray spectrum , which does not appear to be consistent with the cosmic - ray distribution in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the reconstructed gamma - ray spectrum for the region @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( with point - source emission subtracted ) is a power law with photon index @xmath10 . since for a power - law energy distribution",
    "the spectral index of the gamma rays tracks the spectral index of the cosmic rays themselves , the implied cosmic ray index ( @xmath11 ) is much harder than that ( @xmath12 ) measured at earth .",
    "of course , we must be aware of the fact that cosmic rays escape from the galaxy as they diffuse outwards from the centre , on an energy - dependent time scale @xmath13 , with @xmath14@xmath15 ( bhattacharjee 2000 ) .",
    "thus , if most of the cosmic rays detected at earth indeed originate at the galactic centre , then the injected spectrum ought to be flatter ( by a change in index of @xmath16 ) than that observed here , and the two distributions may still be consistent with each other .",
    "this very interesting possibility deserves further analysis , which may be facilitated by the results presented in this paper .",
    "secondly , the diffuse spectrum is remarkably similar to that of the central point source hess j1745290 itself ( @xmath17 versus @xmath18 ) .",
    "though other sources ( such as pulsar wind nebulae ) along the galactic ridge also have similar spectra , the central tev source is by far the brightest and may therefore be the dominant hadron accelerator in this region .",
    "it is indeed of considerable interest to know whether a single source ( say , the supermassive black hole ) could be responsible for producing most of the relativistic particles in the galaxy s central region , regardless of whether or not these should rightly be regarded as members of the overall cosmic - ray population .    in an earlier paper ( ballantyne et al .",
    "2007 ) , we examined the possible role of sagittarius a * in producing the central point source hess j1745290 , and concluded that stochastic acceleration within the inner 2030 schwarzschild radii of the black hole s event horizon could produce both the relativistic electrons responsible for sagittarius a * s mm - spectrum , as well as an outflowing flux of relativistic protons that diffuse outwards to fill the inner 23 pc region , where they scatter predominantly with molecular gas in the circumnuclear disk to produce the tev signal .",
    "only @xmath19 of these protons encounter the disk , however , so up to this point , it is still not known whether the remainder of these particles can diffuse outwards to much larger radii to produce the diffuse emission along the galactic ridge .",
    "in addition , it is not yet clear whether sagittarius a * itself is the main contributor of relativistic hadrons to the source hess j1745290 .",
    "at least two alternative models have been proposed , including a plerion scenario with sagittarius a * as the wind source ( atoyan and dermer 2004 ) , and a pulsar wind nebula discovered recently within only a light - year of sagittarius a * ( wang , lu , and gotthelf 2005 ) . but all leptonic models for the tev emission in hess j1745290 ( and possibly elsewhere along the ridge ) are subject to the extremely rapid cooling rates resulting from the intense photon fields and relatively strong magnetic fields in and around the molecular clouds in this part of the galaxy",
    ".    one of the principal goals of this paper is therefore to examine whether relativistic protons accelerated by sagittarius a * can in fact fill the @xmath20 region surrounding the black hole to account for the diffuse tev emission as well .",
    "we will conclude that this scenario is very unlikely .",
    "however , adhering to the idea that hadronic cascades , rather than inverse - compton - scattering lepton distributions , are more likely to produce the diffuse tev signal , we will also consider other source configurations that produce a tev emissivity consistent with the hess data .",
    "in subsequent sections , we will first assemble the data pertaining to the molecular gas distribution at the galactic centre , and then describe our approach in setting up a turbulent magnetic field through which the hadrons must diffuse .",
    "as they wind their way outwards from their respective source(s ) , the protons lose energy steadily before finally scattering with other protons , and we will examine the processes that dominate this energy loss rate .",
    "we will describe our technique for calculating the proton propagation through this medium , which does not rely on a  standard \" diffusion approach , but is instead more robust and less dependent on unknown factors , such as the diffusion coefficients .",
    "finally , we will summarize our method for calculating the particle cascade ( once a collision has occurred ) , and describe our simulations and results .",
    "observations of the inner few hundred parsecs of the galaxy reveal a large concentration ( up to @xmath7 ) of dense molecular gas ( gsten and philipp 2004 ) .",
    "much of this material is concentrated within giant molecular clouds , with a size @xmath21@xmath22 pc . compared with their counterparts in the galactic disk , the galactic centre ( gc )",
    "molecular clouds are denser and warmer .",
    "emission maps of density - sensitive molecular species , e.g. , cs ( bally et al .",
    "1985 ) , h@xmath23co ( gsten and henkel 1983 ) , and hc@xmath24n ( walmsley et al . 1986 ) , indicate that the gc clouds are  clumpy \" , with high - density ( @xmath25 @xmath26 ) regions embedded within a less dense ( @xmath27 @xmath26 ) intra - cloud medium .",
    "the average cloud density is then roughly @xmath28 @xmath26 , which is quite large compared with the value @xmath29 @xmath26 for a typical disk cloud , but necessary if the gc clouds are to survive the strong tidal forces in the galactic - centre potential .",
    "the temperature of gc clouds is also relatively high ( @xmath30@xmath31 k ) and fairly uniform ( morris et al . 1983 ) .",
    "cloud temperatures were first estimated using measurements of metastable transitions of ammonia ( nh@xmath24 ) and later confirmed by ast / ro ( * a*ntarctic * s*ubmillimeter * t*elescope and * r*emote * o*bservatory ) observations of co line emission ( see , e.g. , kim et al .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission detected from the galactic centre by _",
    "chandra _ indicates the presence of  soft \" ( @xmath32 kev ) and  hard \" ( 8 kev ) plasma components coexisting with the giant molecular clouds ( muno et al .",
    "2004 ) . while supernova shock waves can provide an explanation for the cooler plasma ,",
    "the origin of the hard component is still uncertain .",
    "clearly , though , the galactic centre is a warm environment and many possible heating mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed cloud temperatures .",
    "direct heating by energy dissipation via collisions with dust has mostly been discounted due to the comparatively low temperature of the dust particles ( @xmath33 k ; pierce - price et al .",
    "other possibilities include magnetic viscous heating , small scale dissipation of supersonic turbulence , large scale j- and c - shocks , and uv - heating in exposed photo - dissociation layers .",
    "more than likely , all of these mechanisms contribute on some level , but the dissipation of supersonic turbulence appears to be the most promising means by which the majority of the molecular clouds are warmed as the heating rate of this process is comparable to the cooling rate of the gas .",
    "the gc molecular clouds are also threaded by a pervasive magnetic field , whose strength is revealed , e.g. , by the presence of non - thermal filaments ( ntfs ) in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the ntfs appear in radio images as long thin strands ( tens of pc in length while only fractions of a pc wide ) more or less perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy ( morris 2007 ) .",
    "the strongly polarized synchrotron emission from the ntfs indicates that the magnetic field points along the filaments , whose apparent rigidity when they interact with molecular clouds and the turbulent interstellar medium suggests field strengths on the order of a few milligauss ( see , e.g. , yusef - zadeh and morris 1987 ) .",
    "whether the ntfs are manifestations of a large - scale poloidal magnetic field or are localized structures has not been firmly established .",
    "mid- and far - infrared thermal dust emission from magnetically aligned dust grains provides additional information about the direction of the magnetic field within the warm , dense molecular clouds . in direct contrast to the ism field ,",
    "the magnetic field within the clouds is , for the most part , parallel to the galactic plane ( werner et al .",
    "clues regarding how the galactic centre can have both poloidal and toroidal magnetic field configurations are provided by submillimeter polarization measurements of the central molecular zone by chuss et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which show that the field orientation is linked to the density of the region . differential motion between dense material and the surrounding medium shears the poloidal magnetic field making it more toroidal , whereas less dense regions ( like the cloud envelope ) do not have sufficient mass to distort the initial field .",
    "the cause of the stability of the gc giant molecular clouds has also been the subject of much discussion .",
    "it had been shown that , in general , the co luminosity of a molecular cloud scales with its virial mass ( young and scoville 1991 ) . using this result , the molecular mass of a region could be determined from its measured co luminosity by using a standard conversion factor @xmath34^{-1})$ ] .",
    "however , measurements by oka et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show that gc molecular clouds do not follow the @xmath35@xmath36 trend of galactic disk clouds . simply changing the @xmath37-factor used for gc clouds is not an option since its value is set by observations of @xmath38-ray ( blitz et al .",
    "1985 ) and far - infrared ( cox and laureijs 1989 ) emission . based on these findings , oka et al .",
    "( 1998 ) conclude that gc clouds larger than @xmath30 pc are not bound by their self - gravity but are instead in equilibrium with the external pressure of the galactic centre environment .",
    "however , the observed pressure due to a hot plasma @xmath39 is an order of magnitude smaller than that required since the turbulent pressure within the clouds is @xmath40 ( gsten and philipp 2004 ) .",
    "clouds may instead be bound by their own magnetic fields . equating the turbulent and magnetic ( @xmath41 ) energy densities",
    "gives field strengths of @xmath42 mg within the clouds .",
    "then , using the pressure - bound assumption , oka et al .",
    "( 1998 ) infer the value @xmath43 for the lower limit to the mass of molecular gas within the inner 400 pc of the galaxy .    in spite of this abundant material , however , it is somewhat surprising that the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the galactic centre is currently not especially high ( @xmath44@xmath45 yr@xmath46 in the central 500 pc as opposed to @xmath47 yr@xmath46 in the disk ; gsten 2004 , and references cited therein ) .",
    "detection of 6.7 kev line - emission due to a helium - like iron k - shell transition by yamauchi et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , though , suggests that either @xmath481,000 supernova explosions , or one @xmath49-erg explosion , occurred in this region within the past @xmath50 years .",
    "their results lend independent support to the earlier work of von ballmoos , diehl , and schnfelder ( 1987 ) , who investigated the 1.8 mev @xmath38-ray emission from @xmath51al , produced in nuclear reactions during energetic events like supernova explosions .",
    "these observations indicate that the galactic centre may have been a more active star - forming region in the recent past .",
    "other than the physical conditions within these clouds , the remaining ingredient required to assemble a reasonable representation of the molecular gas distribution along the galactic ridge is the three - dimensional spatial positioning of the cloud centroids . the positions in the plane of the sky of the 14 dominant giant molecular clouds ( see table 1 ) in the galactic centre region",
    "@xmath52 were taken from oka et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for convenience",
    ", we divided the longitudinal coordinate into 10 bins , each with a width @xmath53 , and tabulated the number of clouds whose centre occurs in the range between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the cloud spatial distribution along the line - of - sight ( i.e. , the @xmath56-direction ) is not known , but we used a randomization procedure to attribute a value of this coordinate to each cloud , constrained by the requirement that the distribution in @xmath56 matches the distribution in @xmath2 . for each cloud in bin @xmath57 in the longitudinal direction , we assigned a randomly chosen cloud to the corresponding bin along the line - of - sight direction .",
    "then , each cloud in bin @xmath57 was given a line - of - sight position @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the lower bound on bin @xmath57 , @xmath60 is a randomly chosen number between 0 and 1 , and @xmath61 is the bin size .",
    "clouds were re - binned and/or re - positioned if overlap between clouds occurred . using this method , we produced two different molecular cloud maps , shown in figures  1 and 2 .",

    "as the protons diffuse , a fraction of them undergo a @xmath64 scattering event after traveling a total path length @xmath66 , according to the rate @xmath67 these @xmath64 scatterings create pions that decay , ultimately producing gamma rays , electrons , positrons , and a host of neutrinos .",
    "a simulated image of the gamma ray emission may be obtained by calculating and mapping the spectra of the secondary particles produced in this cascade .",
    "inelastic scatterings between high - energy protons @xmath68 and ambient protons @xmath69 result in a @xmath70 emissivity @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the minimum proton energy needed to produce a pion with energy @xmath73 .",

    ", the differential @xmath70 cross section may be determined using the isobar model of stecker ( 1970 ) ( see also dermer 1986 ) .",

    "our first attempt to match hess s map of the diffuse emission is based on the assumption that all of the cosmic - ray protons originate from sagittarius a * , since only @xmath19 of the hadrons required to account for the central tev source hess  j1745 - 290 actually interact with the circumnuclear disk surrounding the black hole .",
    "the remaining proton efflux could in principle fill the interstellar medium out to @xmath82 , and account for the diffuse tev glow associated with the molecular gas dispersed along the galactic ridge ( see figures  1 and 2 )",
    ".    the gamma - ray count map resulting from our simulation with sagittarius a * as the sole source of high - energy protons , calculated from equations  ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) , is shown in figure  [ fig : resultone ] .",
    "the top panel is a plot of the full range of photon counts spanning eight orders of magnitude in intensity .",
    "however , the actual hess diffuse tev emission map ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ) covers a much smaller dynamic range , dropping by only a factor of two from the highest intensity pixels down to the lowest .",
    "thus , in order to make a direct comparison with the hess data , we also show in the lower panel the corresponding calculated intensity map with the same factor-2 intensity range . in either case , it is clear that the protons from sagittarius a * acting as the lone source of cosmic rays can not explain the observed diffuse gamma - ray emission .",
    "the very evident peak in the tev emission associated with the black hole itself may still be a viable explanation for the central source hess  j1745 - 290 , but subtracting this from the rest of the diffuse emission produces a tev map centred on sagittarius a * , extending out only a fraction of a degree , or at most only about @xmath83 if we include the full 8 orders of magnitude in intensity .",
    "our conclusion is that as long as the magnetic field surrounding sagittarius a * is at least partially turbulent ( we here assumed that half of the magnetic energy is turbulent ) , then the hadronic diffusion away from the galactic centre is too slow to account for @xmath64 scattering events with molecular gas more than a fraction of a degree ( i.e. , only tens of parsecs ) out along the ridge .",
    "we next considered a situation in which the cosmic - ray protons originate from several point sources distributed along the galactic plane .",
    "in addition to diffuse emission , hess has discovered several points sources in this region , including hess  j1745 - 290 , typically associated with supernova remnants or pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "the hess map reveals five tev  hot spots \" in the region @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in the second simulation",
    ", we therefore distributed the proton injection among 5 individual point sources , assigning them the observed latitudes and longitudes , and a random @xmath56 ( line - of - sight ) coordinate consistent with positions between the molecular clouds .    to further test the dependence of our proton diffusion ( and the associated synthetic tev map ) on the magnetic field intensity",
    ", we simulated the hadronic propagation for two values of @xmath86 , @xmath87 g ( figure  [ fig : resulttwo ] ) and @xmath88 g ( figure  [ fig : resultthree ] ) .",
    "as expected , increasing the strength of the magnetic field confines the protons more strongly , and therefore restricts the tev emission to more compact regions surrounding the sources . here too , a dominant feature of the gamma - ray maps is the evident concentration of tev emission near the injection sites , which might account very well for the point sources themselves .",
    "but the diffusion scale is still too small , for both values of magnetic field , to permit the protons to fill the medium between the clouds with a sufficiently dispersed cosmic - ray population to account for the hess intensity map .",
    "decreasing the magnetic field further , to a value @xmath89 g helps , but the synthetic map always contains intensity gradients revealing the location of the point sources , in contrast with the actual tev map , which shows a strong correlation of the gamma - ray emissivity only with the measured concentration of molecular gas and none of the individual point sources .",
    "it is quite evident from these two sets of simulations that if the tev photons are to be produced in hadronic interactions involving the molecular gas , the relativistic protons themselves must be accelerated in situ , throughout the interstellar medium .",
    "the fact that their diffusion length is at most only a fraction of a degree , means that even a remote acceleration site , well away from the molecular clouds , can not produce the required cosmic - ray distribution .    to examine whether protons accelerated throughout the inter - cloud medium can in fact produce the observed diffuse tev emission",
    ", we therefore also simulated a situation in which the protons emerge uniformly via , e.g. , second - order fermi acceleration off the turbulent magnetic field . in this calculation",
    ", the starting point for each proton falls somewhere between the molecular clouds but is otherwise chosen randomly .",
    "figure  [ fig : resultfour ] shows the synthetic tev intensity map resulting from this model , demonstrating a strong correlation with the location ( in projection ) of the molecular gas ( see figures  1 and 2 ) , in excellent agreement with the hess observations .",
    "in summary , then , we have found that the conditions at the galactic centre preclude a point - source origin for the cosmic rays responsible for producing the diffuse tev emission correlated with the molecular gas distributed along the ridge .",
    "the supermassive black hole sagittarius a * may be associated with the central object hess  j1745 - 290 , but its hadronic efflux can not extend out to @xmath90 since the protons lose their energy or scatter with the ambient medium on much smaller scales .",
    "distributed point sources offer the possibility of extending the diffuse tev emission to greater distances from the centre , but they too would produce a morphology with centrally peaked emission regions not consistent with the hess map . only cosmic rays accelerated throughout the inter - cloud medium can produce a diffuse tev glow consistent with the observations .    an important question is therefore whether the particle acceleration occurs within the interstellar medium , or whether the cosmic rays emerge from any known population of sources distributed throughout the galactic ridge . from our simulations",
    ", we infer that the gamma ray emissivity associated with any given object drops by a factor @xmath91 within a distance of roughly @xmath92 .",
    "since this is effectively the contour range of the hess maps , individual sources would not be evident as long as their angular separation were less than this value . in a projected area @xmath93 , this would require about 50 individual sources .",
    "but the total number of tev sources detected by hess ( many of them presumably pulsar wind nebulae ) was far smaller than this .",
    "in addition , only @xmath94 low - mass x - ray binaries have been identified in this region ( bird et al .",
    "2007 ) , and no other class of object with a volume density greater than this is known to be a strong source of relativistic hadrons .",
    "it is therefore likely that the particles are not being injected into the interstellar medium by individual objects .",
    "since the relativistic protons pervading the inter - cloud medium at the galactic centre are accelerated throughout the plane , second - order fermi acceleration may be dynamically important in this region .",
    "a reasonable extension of this work will therefore be the inclusion of stochastic particle acceleration by the same turbulent magnetic field responsible for the particle diffusion .",
    "future extensions of this model should include a self - consistent calculation of the longer wavelength emission produced by particles in the @xmath64-induced cascade . at the very least",
    ", the synchrotron emission due to the secondary leptons spiraling around the assumed magnetic field must not exceed the diffuse radio glow along the ridge . in principle , the tev and radio intensity maps , used together , might produce a unique measurement of the magnetic field under the assumption that a single hadronic process is responsible for both spectral components . the results of this calculation will be reported elsewhere .",
