    "several studies have combined different star formation indicators in order to study the evolution of star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) with redshift . at a given redshift low mass galaxies typically form more stars per unit mass ( i.e. , specific star - formation rate , ssfr ) than more massive galaxies ( juneau et al .",
    "2005 , zheng et al .",
    "2007 , damen et al . 2009 ) .",
    "in addition the ssfr of galaxies with the same mass increases at higher redshift .",
    "however , semi - analytical models and observations are at odds with regards to the rate of decline of the ssfr towards low - redshift ( damen et al .",
    "2009 , guo et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "one of the main observational caveats is that most of the studies covering a wide redshift range use diverse sfr indicators ( such as uv , ir , [ oii ] , h@xmath0 , sed fitting ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that it is difficult to use the same indicator over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "one therefore has to rely on various conversion factors , often intercalibrated at @xmath8 and re - applied at higher redshift .",
    "a well - calibrated standard indicator of the sfr is the h@xmath0 luminosity ( kennicutt , 1998 ) .",
    "however , h@xmath0 is shifted into the infrared at @xmath9 , and it is difficult to measure due to the limitations of ground - based near - ir spectroscopy . comparing measures of h@xmath0 at different redshifts has therefore been a challenge . most of the h@xmath0 studies at high redshift are based on narrow - band photometry ( e.g. the hizels survey , geach et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the 3d - hst survey ( brammer et al . , 2012 ) provides a large sample of rest - frame optical spectra with the wfc3 grism , which includes the h@xmath0 emission in the redshift range @xmath10 . taking advantage of the first data from the survey ( 45% of the final survey products ) we investigate for the first time the star formation history ( sfh ) of the universe with h@xmath0 spectroscopy , using a consistent sfr indicator over a wide redshift range .",
    "we evaluate the dependence of the h@xmath0 equivalent width , ew(h@xmath0 ) , on stellar mass ( @xmath11 ) and redshift ( up to @xmath12 ) , comparing the 3d - hst data with other surveys in mass selected samples with @xmath13 .",
    "since ew(h@xmath0 ) is defined as the ratio of the h@xmath0 luminosity to the underlying stellar continuum , it represents a measure of the the current to past average star formation .",
    "it is therefore a model independent , directly observed proxy for ssfr .",
    "we also derive sfrs from the h@xmath0 fluxes .",
    "we evaluate the mean ssfr in stellar mass bins and study its evolution with redshift .",
    "the slope of the ssfr-@xmath4 relation in different mass bins indicates how fast the star formation is quenched in galaxies of various masses .",

    "the axe package provides a quantitative estimate of the contamination as a function of wavelength , which can be subtracted from the spectra .",

    "we quantify the trend in the following way : we determine the average ew(h@xmath0 ) in three 0.5 dex wide mass bins ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath33 ) and evaluated its error through bootstrapping the sample .",
    "the mean ew(h@xmath0 ) in a given mass bin is obtained in two ways : ( 1 ) using only detected , highly sfgs ( blue lines in figure [ ewmass ] ) and ( 2 ) using all galaxies but assigning ew(h@xmath0)=0 to the objects detected in h@xmath0 with s / n @xmath38 3 ( red lines in figure [ ewmass ] ) . for the @xmath39 data",
    ", we use the the fireworks catalog to establish the fraction of galaxies excluded by the bx selection and therefore give an estimation of ew(h@xmath0 ) for all galaxies .    using either method",
    "we find that an ew(h@xmath0)-mass relation is in place at each redshift , not just for strongly star forming objects but also for the entire galaxy population .",

    "we discuss the evolution of the ew(h@xmath0)-mass relation with redshift in the next section of the letter .",
    "however , it is immediately evident from figure [ ewmass ] that the 3d - hst survey targets galaxies with ew(h@xmath0 ) typical of an intermediate regime between what is seen at z=0 and what is seen at higher redshift . in other words",

    "such high values of ew(h@xmath0 ) represent just 11% of the 3d - hst sample ( 14.6% , 8.1% and 4.7% respectively for increasing mass bins ) .",
    "the evolution of ew(h@xmath0 ) with redshift can be seen as an observational ( i.e. model - independent ) proxy for the ssfr-@xmath4 relation .",

    "a substantial increase of the ew(h@xmath0 ) is seen at higher redshifts in both samples .",
    "we therefore infer that evolution of the sfr is not a byproduct of selection effects from different sfr indicators . at @xmath1 ,",
    "a galaxy has on average an ew(h@xmath0 ) that is 3 - 4 times higher than that of an object of comparable mass in the local universe .",
    "for each mass bin we parametrize the redshift evolution of the ew(h@xmath0 ) as follows : @xmath44 the coefficient @xmath45 has an average value of @xmath46 , with little dependence on mass ( best fit values are listed in table [ slopes ] ) .",
    "as can be deduced from table 1 there may be a weak mass dependence such that the relations steepen with mass ; however , the difference between the slopes at the lowest and highest mass bin is not statistically significant .",
    "this indicates that the decrease of ew(h@xmath0 ) happens at the same rate for all galaxies irrespectively of their masses . as seen in the right panel of figure 2 ,",
