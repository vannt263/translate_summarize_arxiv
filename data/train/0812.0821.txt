    "spiral galaxies present two faces to observers . when seen in blue light , these galaxies look disordered , with spurs , branches and feather - like structures seen even in grand design galaxies , while k - band images show that these galaxies possess smooth , usually two - armed spiral patterns .",
    "we study here the dynamical interaction between the population i component seen in blue light and the older population ii component revealed in the longer wavelengths , specifically with the intent of understanding how the interaction between the gas and the stars affects the time evolution of spiral structure in the stellar disk .",
    "the idea that the stellar spiral structure is not a material phenomenon , but a roughly time - steady density wave rotating at a pattern speed was developed in the seminal work of lin & shu ( 1964 ; henceforth ls64 ) .",
    "toomre ( 1964 ) gave the minimum radial stellar velocity disperion required to suppress the onset of local instabilities in a razor - thin stellar disk stabilized by rotation and the velocity dispersion of stars on large and small scales respectively .",
    "much of the early numerical work of the study of spiral structure utilized n - body simulations to study the growth of spiral instabilities in the collionsionless components of galaxies .",
    "transient spiral structure was evinced in the early n - body simulations of hohl ( 1970 ) , as well as in the later works of sellwood & carlberg ( 1984 ; henceforth sc84 ) .",
    "toomre ( 1981 ) showed that a shearing disk with a supply of leading waves will swing amplify these leading disturbances to trailing disturbances , and was one of the earliest works to emphasize the role of cosmological accretion of gas .",
    "tidal disturbances or minor mergers can torque the stellar disk and create transient spiral structure ( hernquist & mihos 1995 ) . some of these early influential works noted that the dissipative nature of gas may provide a self - regulatory influence in the combined gas - disk system ( lin & shu 1964 ; bertin & lin 1996 ) , with dissipation in the gas layer serving to continually regenerate the shearing spiral instability ( goldreich & lynden - bell 1965 ) .",
    "contemporary numerical investigations of spiral structure have focused mainly on the response of a gas disk when driven by a spiral potential , to varying levels of physical detail and numerical sophistication .",
    "kim & ostriker ( 2002 ) carried out local magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations to study the development of spiral substructure in a gas disk forced by a spiral potential .",
    "chakrabarti , laughlin & shu ( 2003 ) ( henceforth cls ) studied the development of spiral substructure due to ultraharmonic resonances using global simulations which incorporate the self - gravity of the gas and found that inter - arm features of long azimuthal extent occurred at resonance locations , which they called `` branches '' .",
    "cls also found that when the gas disk is forced by a time - steady , but nonlinear spiral potential ( which is composed of many fourier components ) , overlap of resonances produced a highly time - dependent response in the gas which they speculated may signal the onset of turbulence in the purely hydrodynamic regime .",
    "shetty & ostriker ( 2006 ; henceforth so06 ) carried out global mhd simulations and found that the magneto - jeans instability is effective at forming spiral - substructure in low - shear ( i.e. , near the spiral arms ) regions when the magnetic field is large .",
    "the stabilizing effect of magnetic pressure allowed these simulations to be carried out for longer times than those of cls .",
    "yanez et al.s ( 2007 ) hydrodynamic simulations also evince the role of ultraharmonic resonances in the development of spiral sub - structure in the gaseous component .",
    "a significant work on the analysis of spiral structure in self - gravitating disks is that of laughlin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) - these authors rigorously show that the primary unstable mode is endemic to the disk and not due to the numerical implementation .",
    "one of the essential points evinced by these simulations of the response of a self - gravitating gas disk to a time - steady stellar potential is that low @xmath0 gas disks display a very time - dependent response and continue to do so over many dynamical times ( where we refer to the toomre q parameter , i.e. , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the sound speed of the relevant component ; toomre 1964 ) .",
    "this is in marked contrast to purely stellar disks which may exhibit transient spiral structure ( if they are low @xmath0 disks ) but the spiral patterns disappear after a few dynamical times .",
    "block et al .",
    "( 1994 ; 1996 ) found that many spiral galaxies have a grand design structure in infrared light ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1984 ; rix & zaritsky 1995 ) while appearing quite flocculent in blue light .",
    "they interpret this discrepancy in morphology to mean that the population i and population ii components are dynamically decoupled .",
    "recent multi - wavelength observations have begun to address in detail the long term evolution of spiral structure in nearby galaxies .",
    "notably , kendall et al . (",
    "2008 ) infer from analysis of high spatial resolution multi - wavelength photometry of m81 ( from the b - band to irac bands ) a phase shift between the gas and the stars that is suggestive of a long - lived spiral structure in the stellar disk .",
    "global torques may have a role in fueling star formation over many gyrs if they are able to transport the large amounts of mass in extended hi disks ( wong & blitz 2002 ) to the inner regions .",
    "these issues require a @xmath3 analysis that treats the interplay between gas and stars rather than treating the response of the gas to an imposed stellar potential as has been studied previously ( cls ; so06 , among other previous papers ) .    in this paper",
    ", we employ high resolution three - dimensional simulations performed with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget-2 ( springel 2005 ) to simulate the evolution of @xmath4 in the stellar disks of galaxies that are evolving in relative isolation .",

    "( 2008 ) suggests that the milky way has not undergone recent ( i.e. , after @xmath5 ) significant merger events .",
    "we study here the problem of the generation and evolution of spiral structure in an isolated galaxy with gas , stars , and a dark matter halo , where these components are free to interact dynamically with each other . specifically , by including not only the stars with their gravitational forces and velocity dispersions , but also the cold interstellar gas with its self - gravity , pressure , its ability to cool radiatively and dissipate energy through shocks , and form new stars , we focus our study on the dynamical coupling between the gas and the stars and the torques that the gas is able to exert on the stars , an effect that has not been analyzed in previous studies which have focused on the effect of the stars ( whether live or modeled through a potential ) on the gas ( hernquist & mihos 1995 ; cls ; s006 ; kim & ostriker 2007 ) . we also comment on the coupling with the live halo and its role as a sink of angular momentum , as has been noted in previous studies of bar instabilities ( athanassoula 2003 ; martinez - valpuesta et al .",
    "2006 ; berentzen et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we find that the dissipative nature of the gas leads to @xmath6 , @xmath7 azimuthal features , with the gas response leading the stellar response , which allows for a phase shift between these components such that the gas is able torque the stars .",
    "it is this angular momentum transport interior to co - rotation that allows for the stellar disk to be unstable to spiral structure for a longer time ( many revolutions ) compared to simulations that do not include the dissipative gaseous component .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we review the simulation methodology , specifically the initial equilibrium structure of the disks and implementation of radiative cooling , viscosity , and star formation prescriptions for turning gas into stars . in  3 , we give our results for simulations that treat the collionsionless components only , and in  4 , we describe results from simulations that include the time evolution of gas , stars , and a dark matter halo .",
    "we discuss our results in the context of observations in  5 , and we conclude in  6 .",
    "the appendices are devoted to a detailed exploration of simulation parameters and assumptions that can affect the gas - star angular momentum transport , specifically the artificial bulk viscosity and equation of state for the gas .",
    "we employ the parallel treesph code gadget-2 ( springel 2005 ) to perform simulations of isolated disk galaxies .",
    "gadget-2 uses an n - body method to follow the evolution of the collionsionless components , and sph to follow the gaseous component .",
    "energy and entropy are both conserved in regions free of dissipation .",
    "the simulations reported here ( unless otherwise noted ) have gravitational softening lengths of @xmath8 for the gas and stars , and @xmath9 for the halo .",
    "the number of gas , stellar , and halo particles are @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively for our fiducial case . the total angular momentum of these simulations is conserved to 0.1 % over 3 gyr for a time integration error tolerance accuracy of 0.025 . in appendix",
    "a , we give some results of a few cases where we vary the artificial bulk viscosity and the equation of state - these simulations are performed at lower resolution and their specifications are noted in the appendix .",
    "the implementation of viscosity in gadget-2 is described in detail in springel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and springel ( 2005 ) , so we briefly review the results here .",
    "gadget-2 uses a bulk artificial viscosity which is the shear - reduced version ( balsara 1995 ; steinmetz 1996 ) of the standard monaghan and gingold ( 1983 ) artificial viscosity .",
    "specifically , the form of the artificial viscosity experienced between particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 is taken to be given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the arithmetic mean of the sph density estimator ( equation 5 in springel 2005 ) of particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath2 and @xmath17 are the sound speeds , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the relative projected velocities . here",
    ", we adopt a fiducial value of 0.75 for the bulk artificial viscosity @xmath20 parameter .",
    "this value has been empirically recommended by springel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) by comparing the results of the shock tube test to other numerical implementations . in discontinuities that develop in the gaseous flow ,",
    "the entropy generation and width of the shock is proportional to this parameter .",
    "we vary this parameter in appendix a and find that angular momentum transport from the gas to the stars is inhibited for very low values of the artificial bulk viscosity parameter . for low @xmath20 values ,",
    "the effect of dissipation in shocks is prohibited such that the gaseous component becomes more akin to the collionsionless component and the stars no longer exhibit a significant time lag or azimuthal phase shift in their response .",
    "radiative cooling and heating are implemented in gadget-2 in a manner similar to katz , weinberg & hernquist ( 1996 ) ( henceforth kwh96 ) .",
    "the code implements radiative cooling for an optically thin gas of helium and hydrogen in collisional ionization equilibrium with a user - specified ( time - dependent ) ultraviolent background .",
    "radiative cooling allows the gas to dissipate energy and form dense , cold clumps , which as we describe below are prone to star formation .",
    "for the densities resolved in these simulations , radiative cooling due to two - body processes is important , namely , collisional excitation of neutral hydrogen ( @xmath21 ) and singly ionized helium ( @xmath22 ) , collisional ionization of @xmath23 and @xmath22 , standard recombination of @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , dielectric recombination of @xmath26 and free - free emission .",
    "the adopted cooling rates are given in table 1 of kwh96 .",
    "the heating rate from photoionization can be computed once the intensity of the uv background is specified .",
    "since this heating rate is very low inside disks in the local universe , we do not make use of this heating rate from a uv background .",
    "the version of gadget-2 that we employ uses a sub - resolution model for energy injection from supernovae that is proportional to the star formation rate ( springel & hernquist 2003 ) . in this approach ,",
    "the ism is taken to be composed of cold clouds from which stars can form , which are embedded in a pressure - confining hot phase .",
    "the effective equation of state for this two - component gas ( eq .",
    "24 in springel et al .",
    "2001 ) is taken to be 0.25 for our fiducial cases .",
    "in essence , employing such a equation of state for the star forming gas allows one to transition from the isothermal case to a stiffer than isothermal equation of state , where in the latter case energy injection from supernovae ( which is proportional to the star formation rate ) allows one to evolve gas - rich disks for many dynamical times .",
    "we vary the equation of state in appendix b and study its effect on the gas - star angular momentum transport .",
    "we discuss in this paper both simulations where star formation is turned on and those where star formation is turned off . for simulations where star formation is turned on ,",
    "we employ a density dependent kennicutt - schmitdt algorithm , to convert gas to stars in these simulations .",
    "the star formation rate is given by :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the total gas density , @xmath29 for a salpeter imf , and the quantity @xmath30 is given by :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is fixed by the multiphase model and is the threshold density above which the gas is assumed to be thermally unstable to the onset of a two - phase medium composed of cold star forming clouds embedded in a hot , pressure - confining phase ( sh03 ) .",

    "we aim to highlight in this paper general trends in the dynamics that are seen across simulations .",
    "due to the large dynamic range in global galaxy simulations , star formation is currently treated in a prescriptive way . to minimize dependence of our results on our choice of a star formation prescription",
    ", we also include results from simulations where the star formation is turned off . for the simulation where star formation is turned off , there is no energy injection from supernovae ( as sh03 s model takes the energy injection rate to be proportional to the star formation rate ) , and the gas remains isothermal at @xmath34 .",

    "the extended dark matter halo is taken to have a hernquist ( 1990 ) profile , with a concentration parameter of 10 .",
    "we model the disk components of gas and stars as exponential disks , with the fiducial case having a scale length of 3 kpc .",

    "( in retrospect , inclusion of an extended gas disk as seen in observations by wong & blitz ( 2002 ) would have been more empirically suited ) values of these parameters for the other simulations are reported in table 1 .",

    "the primary simulations that we analyze here are the collisionless spngnb simulation , its gaseous analogue ( spgnsfr ) , and its gaseous , star - forming analogues ( spgks and spgks8 ) . for a given cooling curve and star formation prescription , there are two aspects of the gas physics that can affect the gas - star dynamical coupling in these simulations , namely the artificial bulk viscosity and the equation of state for the gas",

    "figure 23 ( a - c ) depicts the angular momentum transfer for the spgnsfr simulation with the bulk viscosity parameter set to zero .",
    "this is similar to the collisionless case , and results in the angular momentum of the stars steadily declining , as there is no transfer from the gas due to a lack of phase shift between the gaseous and stellar components .",

    "figures 25 ( a - c ) depict the spgnsfr case with a artificial bulk viscosity of unity , which results in a very similar behavior of angular momentum transfer as our standard case .",
    "the zero viscosity simulation ( spgnsfr0 ) shows a 24 % loss in the stellar angular momentum out to 1.4 gyr inside of 7 kpc ( which is comparable to the 30 % loss in stellar angular momentum for the reference spngnb purely collisionless case ) , while the standard viscosity case ( spgnsfr ) and the spgnsfr1 both experience a 6 % loss out to 1.4 gyr interior to 7 kpc . in summary ,",
    "the effect of lowering the artificial bulk viscosity is to approximate the purely collisionless problem , thereby removing the phase shift in azimuth that is needed for the gas to exert a torque on the stellar component . aside from the effect of viscosity",
    ", gas particles also exert pressure  this will not affect the angular momentum transport directly , but will affect the propensity of a gas disk to be prone to spiral structure .",

    "another aspect of the gas physics that affects the stability of the gas disk , and indirectly impacts the angular momentum transport to the stellar disk is the assumed equation of state for the gas . as discussed by springel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the equation of state , when it is taken to be greater than zero which is the isothermal limit , models the effect of supernova feedback by over - pressurizing regions relative to an isothermal equation of state .",
    "in the isothermal limit , the pressure in compressed regions increases in proportion to the density .",
    "the multiphase model mediates that for @xmath86 , the gas is thermally unstable and stars can form ; the energy injection rate from supernovae in this model is proportional to the star formation rate .",
    "the compressed gas then would have an effective equation of state that is stiffer than isothermal if it retains this feedback energy .",
    "one can expect that simulations performed with equations of state that are stiffer than isothermal are somewhat less prone to a spiral instability as the effective sound speed has been increased .",
    "we vary the equation of state from 0 - 1 in figures 26(a - c ) and find that the simulation performed with the isothermal equation of state ( eqs0lr ) shows the lowest decrease in stellar angular momentum , while the full multiphase model ( eqs1lr ) has a 25 % decrease in the stellar angular momentum out to 1.4 gyr .",
    "however , this relative decease  18 % versus 25 % , as the equation of state varies from isothermal to the fully pressurized multiphase model is a small enough change to suggest that assumptions about the equation of state for the gas only slightly affect the angular momentum transport to the stellar disk , for a gas fraction of 10 % .",
    "springel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have performed a comprehensive parameter study in terms of the gas fraction and the equation of state to study the effects these parameters have on the gaseous disk .",
    "they find that for the full multiphase model ( stiff equation of state ) even pure gas disks are stable to fragmentation , with an increase in gas fraction lowering the susceptibility of the gas disk to spiral structure . in the multiphase model ,",
    "increasing the gas fraction increases the star formation ( as mediated by the adopted kennicutt - schmidt algorithm ) and thereby the supernova feedback energy ( which is proportional to the star formation rate ) that is deposited into the gas .",
    "this can cause the effective temperature of the gas to be dynamically hotter than the stars . on the other exterme ,",
    "extremely high gas fraction disks that are evolved with an isothermal equation of state undergo violent fragmentation .",
    "thus , extremely high gas fraction disks ( whether they are evolved with an isothermal equation of state or full multiphase model ) will not be effective as angular momentum donors to the stellar disk .",
