    "the subject of minimal surfaces is among the most beautiful - and also most studied - objects in differential geometry , and many times minimal graphs play a important role on the field .",
    "many deep results may be obtained from looking to a minimal surface as a local graph and bringing techniques from partial differential equations to help solve geometric questions .    on a series of papers ( @xcite ) , w. meeks iii , p. mira , j. prez and a. ros studied constant mean curvature spheres on three - dimensional homogeneous spaces and semidirect products of the form @xmath0 came to play a very important role on their proofs .",
    "it is true that any simply connected metric lie group of dimension 3 is either @xmath17 or @xmath18 endowed with a left invariant metric or it is isomorphic and isometric to a semidirect product @xmath0 with its canonical left invariant metric , where @xmath19 is some @xmath20 square matrix ( see the work of w. meeks and j. prez @xcite ) .",
    "although a lot of work has been done on the last years on the ambient space of semidirect products ( or , more generally , on homogeneous spaces of dimension 3 ) , the theory of minimal @xmath6graphs on semidirect products is still on development , and many interesting questions on this field remain open .",
    "for instance is it true that a minimal @xmath6graph on @xmath0 is stable ? or , more generally ,",
    "if the left invariant gauss map of a surface @xmath21 is contained on a hemisphere , does it imply @xmath22 is stable ?",
    "another related question that unfortunately remains unsolved concerns the uniqueness of minimal @xmath6graphs with prescribed boundary .",
    "there are two main difficulties",
    "when dealing with minimal @xmath6graphs on semidirect products @xmath0 : the first one is that vertical translations @xmath23 are not isometries of the ambient space . in particular",
    "this affects the mean curvature operator so its high order terms coefficients depend on the solution , and the comparison principle ( for instance theorem 10.1 of @xcite and its generalizations ) does not apply .",
    "the second one is that , unless @xmath24 , constant functions do not provide minimal graphs , so there is no maximum principle .    on this paper ,",
    "we consider a convex domain @xmath25 with piecewise smooth boundary and exhibit the differential equation some function @xmath4 must satisfy for its @xmath6graph @xmath26 to have prescribed mean curvature function .",
    "depending on the trace and on the determinant of @xmath27 such pde is going to have a different behaviour .",
    "for instance , when @xmath24 , if @xmath4 is a function whose @xmath6graph has non negative mean curvature @xmath28 with respect to the upwards orientation , then it satisfies the maximum principle    @xmath29    this property was first observed by w. meeks , p. mira , j. prez and a. ros ( @xcite , stated on its generality as lemma  [ tracelemma ] below ) , and we remark that does not hold on the case of @xmath8 , even for @xmath30 : a minimal graph that is constant along its boundary necessarily assumes an interior maximum and it is not constant , as horizontal planes ( representing constant functions ) are no longer minimal .",
    "it becomes a natural question to ask if there is a _",
    "maximal jump _ these minimal graphs that are constant along the boundary can attain , and this question is answered via height estimates of partial differential equations .    on section [ seche ] , we prove some of our main results . given @xmath25 and a parameter @xmath31 , we obtain a constant @xmath32 such that every function @xmath4 with mean curvature ( not necessarily constant ) @xmath28 satisfy    @xmath33    this is theorem [ main ] .",
    "still on section [ seche ] it is then proved that the dependence of the a priori constant @xmath7 on is essential ( theorem [ thmabs ] ) for the validity of the result .",
    "we also use the freedom on the parameter @xmath7 in order to obtain that ( on the case @xmath8 , see theorem  [ oscilation ] for details ) the oscillation of a family of solutions to the problem    @xmath34    converges to zero when @xmath35 approaches @xmath11 and goes to infinite , if @xmath36 .",
    "we finish the paper on section  [ secscherk ] , where we bring techniques from killing graphs , in addition to the estimates on the coefficients of the mean curvature operator obtained on section  [ seche ] , to generalize an argument of a. menezes @xcite to any semidirect product @xmath0 , and obtain the existence of minimal @xmath6graphs which are similar to the fundamental piece of the doubly periodic scherk surface of @xmath37 , on theorem [ thmscherks ] .",

    "jaime ripoll for his continuous support , specially for his help on the last section of this work , that is part of my doctoral thesis .",
    "this section is to give a brief review on semidirect products @xmath0 .",
    "we follow the notation and construction of w. meeks and j. prez , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath38 to be two groups and let @xmath39 a group homomorphism between @xmath40 and the group of automorphisms of @xmath5 .",
    "then , the _ semidirect product between @xmath5 and @xmath40 with respect to @xmath41 _ , denoted by @xmath42 , is the cartesian product @xmath43 endowed with the group operation @xmath44 given by    @xmath45    with this group operation , then both @xmath5 and @xmath40 can be viewed as subgroups of @xmath46 and @xmath47 is identified to a normal subgroup of @xmath46 .",
    "this construction comes to generalize the notion of direct product of groups , where the operation on the cartesian product @xmath43 would be the product operation @xmath48 .",
    "it is clear that this notion can be recovered from the one of a semidirect product , when considering the automorphism @xmath49 being the constant map into the identity of the group @xmath5 .    even on the particular case of @xmath50 and @xmath51 being two abelian groups",
    ", it is possible to obtain a great variety of groups via the semidirect product of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , depending uniquely on the choice of the ( now 1-parameter ) family of automorphisms of @xmath52 . precisely , with the exceptions of @xmath17 ( not diffeomorphic to @xmath37 ) and @xmath54 ( has no normal subgroup of dimension 2 ) , it is possible to construct all three dimensional simply connected lie groups ( see @xcite ) using the following setting :",
    "fix a matrix @xmath19 ,    @xmath55    and , for each @xmath56 we consider the automorphism of @xmath52 generated by the exponential map of @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",

    "@xcite ) , that is the one given by stating that @xmath70 are unitary and orthogonal to each other everywhere .",
    "in particular , as it holds    @xmath71    we can express the metric of @xmath0 in coordinates as    @xmath72dx^2+\\left[a_{12}(-z)^2+a_{22}(-z)^2\\right]dy^2+dz^2\\\\ & & + \\left[a_{11}(-z)a_{12}(-z)+a_{21}(-z)a_{22}(-z)\\vphantom{a_{11}(x)^2}\\right](dx\\otimes dy + dy\\otimes dx).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , we remark that @xmath73 , so , as @xmath74 , we have    @xmath75    and we can introduce the notation    @xmath76\\nonumber\\\\ q_{22}(z)\\ = \\ { \\langle \\partial_y,\\,\\partial_y \\rangle } & = & e^{-2z{\\text{trace}}(a)}\\left[a_{11}(z)^2+a_{12}(z)^2\\right]\\label{qij}\\\\ q_{12}(z)\\ = \\ { \\langle \\partial_x,\\,\\partial_y \\rangle } & = & -e^{-2z{\\text{trace}}(a)}\\left[a_{11}(z)a_{21}(z)+a_{12}(z)a_{22}(z)\\right]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to obtain that the metric @xmath77 is expressed by    @xmath78    we notice that , if @xmath79 are two congruent matrices , on the sense that there is some orthogonal matrix @xmath80 such that @xmath81 , then the groups @xmath0 and @xmath82 , endowed with their respective canonical left invariant metrics are _ isomorphic and isometric _ , and the map that makes the identification is a simple rotation on horizontal planes induced by @xmath83 :    @xmath84    we also remark that the lie brackets of @xmath0 satisfy    @xmath85 = 0 , \\ [ e_3,\\,e_1 ] = ae_1 + ce_2 , \\ [ e_3,\\,e_2 ] = be_1 + de_2,\\ ] ]    so levi - civita equation implies that the riemannian connection of @xmath0 is given by    [ cols=\">,^,<,>,^,<,>,^ , < \" , ]     it is important to notice two properties of planes on @xmath0 : first , we observe that the metric @xmath77 is invariant by rotations by angle @xmath2 around the vertical lines @xmath86 , so vertical planes are minimal surfaces of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , horizontal planes @xmath87 have @xmath88 as an unitary normal vector field , so they have constant mean curvature ( with respect to the upward orientation ) given by @xmath89 . in particular , horizontal planes of @xmath0 are going to be minimal if and only if @xmath24 .",
    "0.48     0.48     however , the difference between the cases @xmath24 and @xmath90 go further than horizontal planes being minimal : concerning the classification of simply connected lie groups of dimension 3 , we notice that w. meeks and j. prez , @xcite proved that any _ _ non unimodular _ _ is said to be unimodular if @xmath91 for all @xmath92 lie group of dimension 3 is isomorphic and isometric to a semidirect product @xmath0 , endowed with its left invariant metric , where @xmath19 is such that @xmath90 ( lemma 2.11 , @xcite ) .",

    "for instance , using this property and the mean curvature comparison principle , they are able to prove    [ tracelemma ] let @xmath107 be a convex compact disk and let @xmath108 be its boundary .",

    "however , when @xmath8 no uniform upper bound is obtained , neither a lower bound when @xmath124 . this motivates the search for height estimates for minimal graphs , obtained on the next result .",
    "perhaps , the proof of theorem  [ main ] is as interesting as the result itself , as it gives some understanding on the behaviour of the operator @xmath103 , given by , on the many possible settings for the matrix @xmath27 .",

    "then , there exists a constant @xmath126 such that for every @xmath93 satisfying @xmath127 , it holds that    @xmath128    furthermore , the _ most efficient _ choice for @xmath7 is to take @xmath129 , on the sense that if @xmath130 , gives no relation concerning the difference between the maximum @xmath93 attains on the interior and the maximum it attains on the boundary , and if @xmath131 then @xmath132 , so there is a worsening on the estimate .",

    "we change @xmath594 by making a parallel translation of @xmath606 on the direction of the half - space that contains @xmath398 , whose projection still does not intersect @xmath466 , joined by two small segments and denote such curve @xmath611 , in such a way that @xmath612 bounds a small rectangle on the horizontal plane @xmath613 .",
