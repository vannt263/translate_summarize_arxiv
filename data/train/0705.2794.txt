    "the interaction between two isolated systems can be a resource for quantum information processing @xcite . however , the interaction between an isolated system and the environment surrounding it can lead to decoherence , an undesirable loss of information that was initially available . one way or the other",

    ", we will instead concentrate on the interaction between two harmonic oscillators . more specifically , we are interested in calculating the time evolution of each oscillator separately , after an external interaction hamiltonian has been repeatedly applied to the bipartite system for enough successive characteristic time intervals , until a new equilibrium has been reached .    consider a bipartite system @xmath0 composed of two initially uncoupled subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "if an interaction hamiltonian is applied to this system for a characteristic time interval @xmath3 , the two subsystems will interact and evolve to two new states @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in this paper",

    "the `` refresh '' procedure is a very important ingredient in our model and we will spend some time explaining it in detail in secs .",

    "this article is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we develop a general program for the relaxation of a bipartite system by introducing a periodically repeated interaction scheme . in sec .",
    "iii , we apply this program to a system of two initially uncoupled quantum harmonic oscillators . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the physical interpretation and consequences which arise from solving this problem and present the conditions needed for a new equilibrium to be attained .",
    "we explore specific cases in some detail and present our results graphically . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the implications of our results and suggest possible future directions to be explored .",
    "to quantitatively describe physical situations with pure as well as mixed ensembles , we use the density matrix formalism , introduced independently by landau and von neumann in the @xmath6 s @xcite .",
    "density matrices not only portray the probabilistic nature of a quantum system , but they also contain all the physically significant information we can possibly obtain about the ensemble in question .",
    "the time evolution of a closed quantum system @xmath7 governed by a time - independent hamiltonian @xmath8 is represented by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the unitary time evolution operator given by @xmath11 .",
    "quantum correlations are generated when two such systems are forced to interact through some interaction hamiltonian @xmath12 .",
    "consider a bipartite system @xmath0 composed of two initially uncoupled subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "although the evolution of @xmath0 is unitary , the reduced evolution of @xmath1 or @xmath2 is in general not unitary @xcite . knowing the form of @xmath13 at any time @xmath14 is not sufficient to predict its form at a future time @xmath15 .",
    "so to extract the reduced evolution of subsystem @xmath16 , we need to first calculate the time evolution of @xmath0 and eliminate the effect of the unwanted part by taking the partial trace of the evolved complete system over subsystem @xmath17 .",
    "namely : @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with @xmath8 being the total hamiltonian of the composed system , including @xmath12 .    in our work",
    ", we will follow a scheme similar to one proposed by rau @xcite , in which a constant interaction hamiltonian @xmath12 is applied to a bipartite system @xmath19 composed of two initially uncoupled harmonic oscillators with density matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and with @xmath21 kept in an inexhaustible temperature bath . in rau s model ,",
    "emphasis is given to studying how system @xmath16 relaxes when it is in contact with system @xmath17 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is applied to the composite system @xmath0 for a constant characteristic time interval @xmath3 , interrupted , and then reapplied for another time interval @xmath3 to the time - evolved state @xmath22 , where @xmath23 $ ] , and @xmath24 .",
    "as mentioned above , system @xmath17 is assumed to be in contact with an inexhaustible temperature bath , or reservoir , so that any change it may undergo during the time interval @xmath3 is negligible . in other words , at @xmath25 , a general , constant interaction hamiltonian is applied for a characteristic time interval @xmath3 , the system is allowed to interact , it is then``refreshed '' , and the process is repeated .",
    "the `` interaction '' process is defined as follows : the two quantum systems @xmath1 and @xmath2 interact with one another through the interaction hamiltonian @xmath12 during a time interval @xmath26 , where @xmath3 is fixed . in rau s model ,",
    "the `` refresh '' process is the extraction of the reduced time - evolved quantum part @xmath4 from the complete system @xmath27 and the resetting of @xmath5 back to its initial form . finally , the `` repeat '' process is the application of the same interaction hamiltonian to the new state @xmath22 ( with @xmath24 ) for another time interval @xmath28 .",
    "there are several areas in physics where such a model is a good approximation .",
    "for example , in spintronics , in the case of paramagnetic relaxation , a system of spins interacts with a lattice , and the information is encoded in the spin states of the conduction electrons @xcite . in this case , the conduction electron takes the role of system @xmath16 , and the atoms in the lattice take the role of system @xmath17 , or the environment . as the conduction electron passes through the lattice",
    ", it interacts with a lattice atom , and as a consequence , its state is changed .",
    "this new state will now interact with another atom in the lattice , identical to the first one .",
    "the following assumptions are made in the formulation of generating relaxation as described in rau s model : first , it is assumed that there is statistical independence between the two density matrices of subsystems @xmath16 and @xmath17 at @xmath29 , or in other words , the density matrix of the combined system",
    "can be factorized into density matrices of the component subsystems at @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "second , the relaxation time of the system of interest , subsystem @xmath16 , is much larger than the characteristic interval @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "the system is reset before the time interval specified by the inverse of the interaction energy .",
    "third , time averages are never taken , but after every characteristic time interval @xmath3 , partial trace with respect to the reservoir is taken .",
    "finally , system @xmath17 is assumed to be in an inexhaustible temperature bath so that any change in it during the interaction process is negligible . at each time interval @xmath3",
    ", the system goes back to its original state at @xmath29 while system @xmath16 , the system of interest , changes its state .",
    "the mechanism of refreshing introduced in this model annuls the correlation between the two systems @xmath16 and @xmath17 at every characteristic time interval @xmath3 and replaces the time - evolved state of subsystem @xmath17 with an identical copy of its original state .",
    "implicit in this model is the assumption , invoked by pauli @xcite , that the occupation numbers , which correspond to the diagonal elements of the density matrix , remain good quantum numbers at all times . in other words",
    ", it is assumed that , during the course of time , off - diagonal terms become unimportant .",
    "pauli eliminated them by invoking a `` random- phase approximation '' at all times .",
    "this approximation is a serious ingredient in the analysis of this problem and we believe it is worthwhile to analyze its use at this point . to begin , we stress that the disappearance of interferences between a system and its environment is an irreversible process .",
    "irreversible , or energy - dissipating processes always involve transitions between quantum states .",
    "such processes are described , at the simplest level , by master or rate equations .",
    "the pauli master equation @xcite , is the most commonly used model of irreversible processes in simple quantum systems .",
    "it can be derived from elementary quantum mechanics and by neglecting off - diagonal terms . among other ( inessential to our discussion ) approximations ,",
    "the derivation of the pauli master equation suffers from the restriction that one has to discard any built - up of phase relations by invoking a repeated `` random - phase approximation '' at a series of times at microscopically small intervals .",
    "this restriction may find its justification in van kampen s analysis of the problem in deriving the master equation from quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "specifically , van kampen observed that , by writing a master equation , we only intend to get statements on macroscopically observable properties of ( statistically ) large systems . in trying to derive a master equation from quantum mechanics , we must therefore first construct , following pauli , a suitable coarse - graining of phase - space in such a way that the quantities of the statistical theory are only those that can be measured macroscopically .",
    "van kampen s derivation of the master equation highlights quite explicitly the inherent difficulties of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . to derive a master equation",
    ", we must postulate a number of ( justifiable ) mathematical assumptions , unfortunately in most cases without being able to give the explicit criteria on the microscopic dynamics of the system for these assumptions to be valid .",
    "the general attitude is that because many large systems evolve smoothly on a macroscopic time scale , microscopic details are most likely not important , and must therefore be suppressed .",
    "further , it is assumed that the evolution of the reduced density matrix is a markoff process .",
    "this translates to invoking a repeated random - phase approximation , i.e. neglecting or suppressing any dynamical built - up of phases as time evolves .",
    "for example , in the case of photon scattering , interference terms connecting different positions become unobservable at the macroscopic body itself , though still existing in the whole system .",
    "this was first discussed by von neumann in his theory of the measurement process @xcite . another possible physical mechanism which may aid in explaining",
    "the validity of pauli s approximation is the interaction of the system with its natural environment .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , that the interaction between the system and its environment causes some interference terms to become unobservable .    in this paper",
    ", we will follow a scheme that deviates slightly from the one proposed by rau . in our model",
    ", we again start with two initially uncoupled subsystems described by density matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the crucial difference between the program analyzed by rau and what we propose here , is that system @xmath17 is no longer kept in an inexhaustible temperature bath .",
    "after a constant interaction hamiltonian is applied to the bipartite system for a characteristic time interval @xmath3 , the system is `` refreshed '' , but the `` refresh '' procedure is no longer the same as that described above .",
    "instead of concentrating our attention to studying how system @xmath16 relaxes when in contact with system @xmath17 like in rau s model , we will now look at how each system relaxes when in contact with the other , once @xmath12 is applied to the combined system . system @xmath17 will no longer act as the reservoir which goes back to its initial state after every @xmath3 . instead , both subsystems will be equally important and both will undergo a change in their states during the interaction process .",
    "we will no longer be concentrating on a system in contact with an unchanging environment , but in two systems of interest in contact with each other .",
    "the `` refresh '' procedure as defined in our model can be written as a transformation @xmath30\\otimes tr_1[\\rho_{12}]$ ] . as an aside that will become transparent later on , we state at this point ,",
    "that even though the `` refresh '' procedure is expressed as the tensor product between the time - evolved reduced subsystem states obtained by performing partial traces over each unwanted part separately , the operation of taking the partial trace is performed only once , and over only one of the oscillator subsystems .",
    "the partial trace operation assumes that we consider the relative phase between systems @xmath16 and @xmath17 to be completely randomized and thus we can integrate over it .",
    "in addition to this , we assume that we know nothing about the occupation numbers of each mode of the second system and hence we can sum over them when computing the partial density matrix of system @xmath16 ( and vice - versa for system @xmath17 ) .",
    "further , we assume statistical independence between the two density matrices @xmath13 and @xmath21 at each time @xmath3 . for the time being , we simply state that the `` refresh '' procedure is composed of nothing but a single spectrum measurement in the number basis of one of the oscillators .",
    "this single measurement has a twofold effect : it diagonalizes the output global state in _ both _ oscillator number bases @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and at the same time decouples the two oscillators by allowing us to write the global output state as a tensor product of the two reduced , post - measurement states .",
    "the physical implementation of our model along with this last assumption will become clear in sec .",
    "iii , where we explicitly calculate the reduced density matrix @xmath4 , and extensively discuss the details of the `` refresh '' procedure .    here",
    ", we must emphasize that the `` refresh '' procedure defined in our model is different from the pauli `` random - phase approximation '' employed in rau s model .",
    "formally , the `` refresh ''",
    "procedure is a transformation @xmath33\\otimes\\mbox{tr}_{1}[\\rho_{12}]$ ] and appears to be nonlinear with respect to @xmath34 ( this can be easily observed if @xmath34 is written as a convex sum of pure density matrices ) .",
    "in contrast , the pauli `` random - phase approximation '' is a transformation @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 being the orthonormal basis of the total free hamiltonian ) , that is linear with respect to @xmath34 , and corresponds to vanishing of off - diagonal terms in @xmath34 . whereas the partial trace assumes that we have no knowledge of the occupation numbers of each mode in the second subsystem and",
    "hence we end up averaging over those occupation numbers , the `` random - phase approximation '' considers _ all _ phase relationships to be random .",
    "in contrast to rau s model , we do not have a markovian master equation for either of the two oscillators .",
    "since , in our case , the second system is not reset back to its initial state after each time interval @xmath3 , the other system keeps a memory of what happened in the previous step",
    ". the nonlinearity of the `` refresh '' procedure may raise philosophical questions on the physical realizations associated with it . at this point",
    ", it is perhaps appropriate to clear any confusions that may arise due to the apparent nonlinearity of the transformation : the `` refresh '' procedure is expressed as the tensor product between the two reduced post - measurement states , written as states which are obtained by taking partial traces over the corresponding unwanted parts .",
    "however , like mentioned above and discussed further in section iii of this article , the transformation can be obtained by making a _ single _ , spectrum measurement on the number basis of just one of the two oscillators .",
    "this measurement will not only determine the probability distribution of the occupation numbers in oscillator @xmath16 , but in addition , that of oscillator @xmath17 .",
    "we strongly emphasize that the operation of taking the partial trace is performed only once .",
    "this procedure is no different than that of measuring the spin of an entangled electron pair : a measurement performed on one of the electrons not only determines that electron s spin , but also the spin of the second electron .",
    "therefore , even though in a sense the `` refresh '' procedure appears to be nonlinear in @xmath34 , employing it does not break any physical rules of quantum mechanics .    that being clarified , the `` interact - refresh - repeat '' process of our model is described in more detail below : @xmath37 more specifically , @xmath38\\otimes \\mbox{tr}_1[\\hat{u}\\rho_{12}(0)\\hat{u}^{\\dag}]\\stackrel{\\hat{u}(\\tau)}\\longrightarrow\\ldots\\stackrel{\\hat{u}(\\tau ) } \\longrightarrow \\mbox{tr}_2\\left[\\hat{u}\\rho_{12}[(n-1)\\tau]\\hat{u}^{\\dag}\\right]\\otimes \\mbox{tr}_1\\left[\\hat{u}\\rho_{12}[(n-1)\\tau]\\hat{u}^{\\dag}\\right],\\ ] ] with the time evolution operator given by : @xmath39 a flow chart of our model follows in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowchart ] :    this iteration process is carried out until a new equilibrium is reached .",
    "our aim is to study the large time behavior of this periodically repeated interaction scheme and understand its effect on the reduced quantum subsystems @xmath13 and @xmath21 .",
    "the problem of describing the approach to equilibrium for systems composed of a large number of interacting particles is a very fundamental one , and one that has been studied extensively through the years .",
    "ever since the classic work of boltzmann , it has been recognized that not only statistical , but also dynamical considerations play a role in the time evolution of these systems .",
    "stochastic processes like the one described above are encountered in many contexts in both physics , chemistry , and , more recently , quantum communication .",
    "relevant experimental applications involve the investigation of resonance raman scattering @xcite , as well as collisional decoherence during writing and reading quantum states @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to apply the above recipe to the case of two coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "the system considered here is a set of two initially uncoupled harmonic oscillators @xmath16 and @xmath17 , described by density matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . the two subsystems are initially at equilibrium at temperatures @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the free and interaction hamiltonians of our system are given by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the oscillation frequency of oscillator @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the frequency of the applied interaction hamiltonian .",

    "[ fig : figurehighfrequency ] , the frequencies of the oscillators are equal , but that of the interaction hamiltonian is not , and , finally , in figs . [ fig : figure2 ] and [ fig : figure4 ] , the frequencies of the oscillators and the interaction hamiltonian are all different .",
    "the dashed line represents oscillator @xmath16 and the solid one represents oscillator @xmath17 .",
    "we note some interesting results .",
    "the rate with which the equilibrium is reached depends on an interplay between the characteristic time interval @xmath3 and the interaction frequency @xmath45 . comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : figurelargetau ] and [ fig : figuresmalltau ] , we observe that , for a constant interaction frequency and a shorter characteristic time interval , the harmonic oscillator system reaches equilibrium much faster . this can be understood by noting that as @xmath3 decreases , the period of the applied interaction hamiltonian is decreased , and the oscillators do not have as much time to interact before the interaction is interrupted .",
    "decreasing the length of the interaction prevents the oscillators from returning back the temperature they have exchanged so the equilibrium is achieved faster .",
    "the same effect is observed when we compare figs .",
    "[ fig : figurelargetau ] and [ fig : figurehighfrequency ] : for a constant characteristic time interval and a higher interaction frequency , the oscillators are forced to exchange temperature much faster .",
    "again , the equilibrium is attained more quickly .",
    "further , we note that our prediction is verified : @xmath152 ( or , @xmath153=\\omega_2/[kt_2(\\infty)]$ ] ) , at equilibrium .",
    "we observe that when @xmath159 , the behavior of the system is symmetric .",
    "the two oscillators exchange an equal amount of energy amongst themselves per unit time .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian takes both oscillators out of their respective equilibria and , eventually , after many iterations of the process , the two attain an equilibrium maxwell - boltzmann distribution at an effective temperature @xmath160/2 $ ] that is different from their initial temperatures .",
    "the equilibrium reached here is a thermal equilibrium , in other words , the oscillators have reached a state where their temperatures have ceased to change , and a single temperature can be attributed to the entire system .",
    "this was in fact noted by several individuals including montroll and shuler @xcite , mathews , shapiro , and falkoff @xcite , as well as rau @xcite , but the availability of numerical techniques for carrying out the iteration was not present at the time .",
    "nonetheless , the predictions made were correct and the results are not surprising .",
    "they are simply a consequence of the zeroth law of thermodynamics : when two systems are put in contact with each other , there will be a net exchange of energy between them unless or until they are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this phenomenon has also been studied by andersen and shuler for the specific case of the relaxation of a hard - sphere rayleigh and lorentz gas @xcite .    in all of the above examples ,",
    "the frequencies of the oscillators were equal .",
    "a somewhat more unexpected result ( from a thermodynamical point of view ) , appears in the case where @xmath161 . here , the exchange of energy in the system is not symmetric , such behavior being caused by the fact that the frequencies are not equal .",
    "the equilibrium reached is not a thermal one and the final combined distribution no longer satisfies maxwell - boltzmann statistics .",
    "the oscillators interact through the interaction hamiltonian which takes them out of their initial equilibrium , they exchange quantities ( including temperature ) , and eventually reach a state where each oscillator has attained a new equilibrium at it s own temperature , such that @xmath153=\\omega_2/[kt_2(\\infty)]$ ] . besides imposing the condition that the total number of particles is a constant",
    ", the interaction hamiltonian also dictates that the free energy of the system ( the energy not including the interaction energy ) is conserved only when the frequencies of the oscillators are equal . here , the selection rules imposed by the interaction hamiltonian override the statistical mechanical effects .",
    "we have explicitly calculated the time evolution of an initially uncoupled system of two harmonic oscillators , under the repeated application of an interaction hamiltonian for successive time intervals @xmath3 .",
    "our results were calculated exactly using iterative methods and without using perturbation theory .",
    "we started with two initially uncoupled quantum harmonic oscillators , each at equilibrium and with temperatures @xmath162 and @xmath163 respectively , and showed that after enough periodically repeated applications of the interaction hamiltonian , the oscillators came to equilibrium with each other - _ if _ their frequencies were equal - at an effective temperature which was different from their initial temperatures .",
    "when the frequencies were unequal , each oscillator attained a new equilibrium but there was no effective temperature that could be attributed to both of them . on the one hand ,",
    "when the frequencies of the oscillators were the same , the system s initial maxwell - boltzmann distributions evolved into a thermal equilibrium at a new maxwell - boltzmann distribution through a series of transient boltzmann distributions and on the other hand , when the oscillator frequencies were unequal , the equilibrium reached was not thermal and the final combined distribution at equilibrium no longer satisfied maxwell - boltzmann statistics . to explain this , we showed that , at equilibrium , @xmath152 .",
    "further , we have concluded that the selection rules imposed by the interaction hamiltonian override statistical mechanical effects",
    ".    an important ingredient of our model is what we have called the `` refresh '' procedure . after applying a constant interaction hamiltonian to our initially uncoupled set of harmonic oscillators",
    ", we perform an act of `` refreshing '' .",
    "this corresponds to the assumption that there are no fixed phase relationships between the two harmonic oscillators , while at the same time , the phase relationships between the number states of each individual oscillator are definite . in addition , we assume that we have no knowledge about the occupation numbers of each of the modes in the second system and so we average over all these occupation numbers . the fact that the quantity @xmath147 is conserved by definition of the total hamiltonian in our model , and the fact that the initial density matrix is diagonal in the number basis @xmath70 of the harmonic oscillators , forces the evolved reduced density matrices @xmath164 and @xmath165 with @xmath166 , to be diagonal in their respective number bases @xmath167 and @xmath168 . in turn",
    ", this allows us to write the new combined density matrix after the `` refreshing '' as a product state of the new reduced states of the two oscillators .",
    "we have shown how the `` refresh '' procedure can be obtained through a single , non - selective measurement on one of the two oscillators . a single spectrum measurement in the number basis of oscillator @xmath16 , results in the diagonalization of the output state in both oscillator number bases @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and this in effect permits us to assume statistical independence between the two post - measurement states by allowing us to write the global output state as a tensor product of @xmath13 and @xmath21 .",
    "even though the transformation of the `` refresh '' procedure formally appears to be nonlinear in @xmath34 , this is simply a consequence of how we choose to express it . in effect , the `` refreshing '' model in no different than performing a spin measurement on an entangled electron pair .",
    "naturally , the results obtained in this paper are dependent on the specific model presented , and more specifically , the interaction hamiltonian and the `` refresh '' procedure .",
    "the question we may now ask is : _ how will our results change if any or both of these factors are changed ? _",
    "one of the authors ( a.  c. ) would like to express her sincere thanks to anil shaji , csar a. rodrguez , kavan modi , todd tilma , yafis barlas , and andrew randono for their valuable help on several insightful discussions and for proofreading the manuscript ."
