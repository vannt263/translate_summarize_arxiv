    "the nature of the dark matter ( dm ) that comprises the bulk of the mass in the universe is one of the longest outstanding problems in all of physics . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) with weak scale cross sections and masses in the gev to tev range are among the best motivated dark matter candidates .",
    "recent experiments indicate hints that the dm particle may have been detected . however ,",
    "interpretation of the data depends on our understanding of the velocities of these particles as they pass through the detectors .",
    "the canonical distribution of wimps in the halo of our galaxy is the isothermal maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "however , the real galaxy is not likely to be quite so simple .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that dark matter halos may be triaxial and anisotropic , which can lead to significant differences in the scattering rates and the amplitude and phase of the annual modulation @xcite .",
    "direct detection experiments are sensitive to the form of the local dark matter velocity distribution @xcite , and the results may be significantly modified if a cold stream of dark matter particles exists in the solar neighborhood .",
    "tidal disruption of dwarf satellites is expected to produce such cold streams .",
    "the late infall of dark matter onto the galaxy is also expected to result in cold streams contributing @xmath0 a few percent to the local dark matter density @xcite .",
    "cosmological n - body simulations from the aquarius project @xcite show the presence of tidal streams in the solar neighborhood at the level of @xmath1 of the local dark matter density , at @xmath2 probability .",
    "larger stream contributions are likely if dense tidal streams pass near the sun s location .",
    "streams will tend to dominate in the outer halo , rather than the inner halo - as has been found in stellar surveys thus far ( for a discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have studied the effect of major mergers and conclude that massive ( @xmath3 ) mergers can lead to observable structure in the velocity distribution of dark matter particles .",
    "authors @xcite find that such a merger event is very likely .",
    "previously @xcite showed that in principle such streams should be visible in data from dm detectors by giving rise to a step in the energy spectrum of the count rate : the count rate would be higher up to a critical energy above which the stream could no longer contribute to the data .",
    "future experiments will be sensitive to a wide range of stream velocities .",
    "in particular , as we will show , the cogent experiment may have , over the next few years , the sensitivity to detect such streams .    in 2010 ,",
    "the cogent collaboration @xcite reported an excess of events at low energies , which was interpreted as possibly due to scattering of dark matter particles with the target @xcite .",
    "more recently , cogent reported @xcite the detection of an annual modulation @xcite in the event rate at the 2.8@xmath4 level , with a modulation amplitude of @xmath5% .",
    "the cresst - ii collaboration has also seen unexplained events that are compatible with a possible explanation in terms of wimps @xcite .",
    "it is tantalizing to compare these new results with the decade - old annual modulation seen in the dama data @xcite which has reached @xmath6 confidence level .",
    "all these results indicate a possible @xmath7 gev wimp mass , yet the issue of compatibility between them is unclear .",
    "some authors claim consistency between the different experimental results @xcite while others do not @xcite .",
    "authors @xcite showed that the presence of streams could help to reconcile the dama results with other experiments .",
    "yet more perplexing is the apparent discrepancy of the null results of xenon @xcite and cdms @xcite with both the dama and cogent experiments ; we do not address these null results in this paper , and restrict our discussion only to dama and cogent .",
    "we further address the issue of compatibility between dama and cogent in this paper by extending the discussion , within the context of the standard maxwellian halo , to allow variation in the two relevant velocities characterizing the distribution : the escape velocity and the dispersion .",
    "the focus of the paper , however , is the search for streams in the cogent data .",
    "the low energy threshold ( 0.47 kevee ) and excellent energy resolution ( 0.05 kevee ) obtained by cogent are key to detecting dark matter streams for small particle masses .",
    "the planned upgrade to the cogent experiment ( c-4 ) will consist of 4 detectors , of approximately 1.3 kg each @xcite , and is expected to start taking data later this year .",
    "we test the sensitivity of the cogent upgrade to dark matter streams by performing a number of monte carlo simulations and fitting the results .",
    "we select a dark matter mass and scattering cross - section consistent with the current cogent results , assuming that the excess events currently seen by cogent at low energies is entirely due to scattering of dark matter particles with the target .",
    "we caution the reader that if a significant ( and currently unknown ) exponential background exists at low energies , our conclusions may be altered .",
    "we also do not consider possible ways in which the cogent and dama results could be made compatible with the null results of xenon @xcite and cdms @xcite .",
    "consider dark matter particles of mass @xmath8 scattering elastically off a nucleus of mass @xmath9 .",

    "we provide cogent contours for different values of @xmath19 and @xmath21 , but the xenon and cdms bounds are for specific values of @xmath19 and @xmath21 . thus the cogent contour for @xmath29 km / s is likely excluded when compared to the xenon and cdms exclusion curves for @xmath19 = 260 km / s ( not shown ) .",
    "the dark matter density at the sun s location was set to 0.3 gev/@xmath30 .",
    "we now consider the possibility that in addition to a thermal component of dark matter , there exist dark matter streams , i.e.  particles with small or negligible velocity dispersion .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , such streams are expected to occur due to the tidal break - up of small halos , the sagittarius stream being a well known example .",

    "we study the effect of adding the sagittarius stream by performing monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of future cogent results , taking the stream to compose a fraction @xmath39 of the local density ( which is fixed at 0.3  gev/@xmath30 ) .",
    "we only consider the time averaged information , as the present data does not constrain the annual modulation effectively .",

    "in other words , there is a 50% chance that the cogent results will exclude the shm - only model at the given cl or better .",
    "the horizontal dashed line represents the @xmath54 level .",
    "thus , the sagittarius stream is detectable at @xmath55 with a @xmath0 10  kg - year exposure with cogent , provided the velocity dispersion associated with the stream is low , and the stream contributes 3 - 5% of the local dark matter density .",
    "in this paper , we studied the ability of a future cogent data set to detect the presence of dark matter streams .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations of a halo that consists of both a thermal component , and a cold stream , and fitted 2 models to the simulations : ( i ) a halo model containing the stream and ( ii ) the shm - only model .",
    "we then performed simulations of a fully thermal halo ( i.e. shm - only ) , and fitted the 2 models to the null simulations .",
    "we studied the sagittarius stream as an example , and showed that for stream densities @xmath56 of the local dark matter density , the stream is detectable at the @xmath54 level with an exposure of 10 kg year .",
    "such an exposure is attainable by cogent c-4 within @xmath0 3 years .",
    "we set the particle mass = 10 gev , and assumed knowledge of the stream velocity .",
    "let us now briefly consider variations in these parameters .",
    "+ _ varying the particle mass : _ the particle mass @xmath8=10 gev provides an acceptable fit to the cogent observation , but lies at the high end of the mass range for @xmath19 = 220 km / s .",
    "as the mass is lowered , we lose sensitivity to the stream ( for @xmath19 = 220 km / s ) and for @xmath57 gev , the sagittarius stream becomes almost completely invisible as recoil events fall entirely below the energy threshold of 0.47 kevee .",
    "this is however , dependent on the assumed values of @xmath19 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we have verified with our simulations that for @xmath58 gev , we are able to detect the presence of the stream .",
    "other high velocity streams should be visible for smaller wimp masses .",
    "+ _ varying the stream parameters : _ in order to test the importance of our knowledge of the stream parameters , we perform fits with a random component added to the stream velocity .",
    "the stream speed relative to the sun is chosen at random to lie between @xmath5950 km / s from the true value , while the two angles that describe the stream arrival direction are chosen to lie between @xmath5920 degrees of the true direction .",
    "this represents a small uncertainty in our knowledge of the stream parameters .",
    "we performed fits to 1000 mc simulations of the shm+5% sagittarius stream , with 25 such random velocities , and obtained @xmath32 values ranging from 8.4 to 12.1 , with a median value of 9.3 with 9 d.o.f . by comparison , knowledge of the true stream parameters yielded a @xmath32 of 8.2/9 d.o.f .",
    "the shm - only model resulted in a substantially worse fit ( for @xmath39=0.05 ) , with a @xmath32 of 16.7/10 d.o.f .",
    "we thus conclude that an approximate knowledge of the stream parameters is still useful when analyzing data from experiments .",
    "we have shown that dark matter streams are potentially detectable by the future cogent c-4 experiment . ignoring the presence of streams may result in erroneous estimates of @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "for sufficiently large exposures , the annual modulation provides additional information .",
    "the annual modulation is an excellent indicator of streams @xcite , and should reveal the presence of the stream at a measured energy near the cutoff energy of the stream .",
    "reconstructing the stream parameters for arbitrary dark matter streams using a combination of the percentage modulation and the total number of recoils will enable us to understand the phase space distribution of dark matter in the solar neighborhood . in previous work @xcite",
    ", we showed that streams can alter the phase and structure of the annual modulation . in certain energy bins",
    ", the presence of the stream may only be apparent during part of the year , when the stream speed relative to the earth is largest . in these energy bins ,",
    "the annual modulation due to a @xmath0 few percent stream may result in an annual modulation of a few percent , comparable to the contribution of the entire maxwellian halo . observing the variation in the amplitude of the annual modulation in different energy bins provides valuable information regarding the particle mass @xcite .",
    "the phase of cogent s annual modulation does not fit the shm very well and in our next analysis we will investigate whether streams lead to a better fit .",
