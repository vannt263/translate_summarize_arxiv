    "although observations of acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuation spectra are sensitive to the curvature of spacetime , and appear to require some form of cosmological dark energy , they may be less useful for discriminating among different equations of state for the dark energy .",
    "various studies ( e.g. ) have concluded that the signatures of different types of spatially smooth , evolving dark energy on the cmb spectra are relatively undiscriminating , in part because cmb fluctuations were formed at high redshift , when the dark energy was not a prominent constituent , although spatial fluctuations in the dark energy could lift the degeneracy considerably @xcite . by contrast",
    ", observations of sources at small to moderate redshifts ( @xmath0 ) would probe epochs where the dark energy is prominent , leading to suggestions that observations of type ia supernovae or of galaxy counts could be used to determine the nature of the dark energy most effectively . however , the efficacy of these observational programs is controversial , as there is considerable degeneracy among the predictions of different dark energy models for , for example , the luminosity distance as a function of redshift@xcite .",
    "one approach to the analysis of low redshift data would be to presume particular classes of models , perhaps parametrized by a series expansion of @xmath2 , and then attempt to constrain the model parameters by a likelihood or bayesian method ( e.g. ) .",
    "a second approach is to fit the data by a parametric representation of , for example , the luminosity distance as a function of redshift , and then analyze the results to constrain the properties of the dark energy indirectly ( e.g. ) . although the first approach is preferable ( because it generally avoids difficulties associated with differentiating data , and allows a simpler assessment of uncertainties in derived parameters , in addition to outlining its implicit assumptions more clearly ) , the second approach is more useful for understanding whether or not such observations can ever yield a unique solution for the dark energy equation of state .    in this short note ,",

    "the answer , as we shall see , is _ no _ : a _ separate _ determination of the fraction of the universe in the form of nonrelativistic particles is needed @xcite .",
