    "semitauonic @xmath7 meson decays of the type @xmath12  @xcite are sensitive probes to search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "charged higgs bosons , which appear in supersymmetry and other models with at least two higgs doublets , may contribute to the decay to due to large mass of the @xmath13 lepton and induce measurable effects in the branching fraction .",
    "similarly , leptoquarks , which carry both baryon number and lepton number , may also contribute to this process .",
    "the ratio of branching fractions @xmath14 is typically used instead of the absolute branching fraction of @xmath15 , to reduce several systematic uncertainties such as those on the experimental efficiency , the ckm matrix elements @xmath16 , and on the form factors .",
    "the sm calculations on these ratios predict @xmath17  @xcite and @xmath18  @xcite with precision of better than 2% and 6% for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "exclusive semitauonic @xmath7 decays were first observed by the belle collaboration @xcite , with subsequent studies reported by belle @xcite , @xcite , and lhcb @xcite collaborations .",
    "all results are consistent with each other , and the average values of refs .",
    "@xcite have been found to be @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite , which exceed the sm predictions for @xmath19 and @xmath20 by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the combined analysis of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , taking into account measurement correlations , finds that the deviation is @xmath25 from the sm prediction .",
    "so far , measurements of @xmath26 at the @xmath7 factories have been performed either using a hadronic @xcite or an inclusive tagging method @xcite .",
    "semileptonic tagging methods have been employed for use in studies of @xmath27 decays , and have been shown to be of similar experimental precision to that of the hadronic tagging method @xcite . in this paper , we report the first measurement of @xmath19 using the semileptonic tagging method .",
    "we reconstruct signal @xmath28 events in modes where one @xmath7 decays semi - tauonically @xmath29 where @xmath30 , ( referred to hereafter as @xmath31 ) and the the other @xmath7 decays in a semileptonic channel @xmath32 ( referred to hereafter as @xmath33 ) . to reconstruct normalization @xmath28 events , which correspond to the denominator in @xmath19 , we use both @xmath7 mesons decaying to semileptonic decay modes @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "we use the full @xmath4 data sample containing @xmath36 @xmath37 pairs recorded with the belle detector @xcite at the kekb @xmath5 collider @xcite .",
    "the belle detector is a general - purpose magnetic spectrometer which consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) comprised of csi(tl ) crystals .",
    "the devices are located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath38 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) . the detector is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .    to determine the acceptance and probability density functions ( pdf ) for signal @xmath29 , normalization @xmath32 , and background processes we use monte carlo ( mc ) simulated events , which are based on the evtgen event generator @xcite and the geant3 package @xcite .",
    "the mc samples for signal @xmath29 events are generated using the decay model based on the heavy quark effective theory  @xcite .",

    "the normalization mode @xmath45 is simulated using hqet , and reweighted according to the current world average form factor values : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the sample sizes of the signal , @xmath3 , and continuum @xmath49 @xmath50 production processes correspond to about 40 , 10 and 6 times the integrated luminosity of the on - resonance collision data sample , respectively .",
    "charged particle tracks are reconstructed with the svd and cdc , and the tracks other than @xmath51 daughters are required to originate from near the interaction region .",
    "electrons are identified by a combination of the specific ionization ( @xmath52 ) in the cdc , the ratio of the cluster energy in the ecl to the track momentum measured with the svd and cdc , the response of the acc , the shower shape in the ecl , and the match between the positions of the shower and the track at the ecl surface .",
    "to recover bremsstrahlung photons from electrons , we add the four - momentum of each photon detected within 0.05 radians of the original track direction .",
    "muons are identified by the track penetration depth and hit distribution in the klm .",
    "charged kaons are identified by combining information from the @xmath52 in the cdc , the flight time measured with the tof , and the response of the acc @xcite .",
    "we do not apply any particle identification criteria on charged pions .",
    "candidate @xmath53 mesons are formed by combining two oppositely charged tracks with pion mass hypotheses .",
    "we require the invariant mass to lie within 15 mev/@xmath54 of the nominal @xmath55 mass @xcite .",
    "we then impose the following additional requirements : ( 1 ) the two pion tracks must have a large distance of closest approach to the ip in the plane perpendicular to the electron beam line ; ( 2 ) the pion tracks must intersect at a common vertex that is displaced from the ip ; ( 3 ) the @xmath53 candidate s momentum vector should originate from the ip .",
    "neutral pion candidates are formed from pairs of photons with further criteria specific to whether the @xmath56 is from a @xmath57 decay and @xmath58 decay .",
    "for the neutral pions from @xmath58 decays , we require the photon daughter energies to be greater than 50 mev , the cosine of the angle between two photons to be greater than 0.0 , and the @xmath59 invariant mass to be @xmath60 to @xmath61 mev/@xmath54 around the nominal @xmath56 mass @xcite which corresponds to approximately @xmath62 , where photons are measured as an energy cluster in the ecl with no associated charged tracks .",
    "a mass - constrained fit is then performed to obtain the @xmath56 momentum . for neutral pions from @xmath57 decays , which have lower energies ,",
    "we require one photon to have at least 50 mev and the other to have at least 20 mev .",
    "we apply a tighter window on the invariant mass to compensate for the lower photon energy requirement , within 10 mev/@xmath54 of the nominal @xmath56 mass , which corresponds to approximately @xmath63 .",
    "neutral @xmath58 mesons are reconstructed in the following decay modes : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",

    "we require a wider invariant mass window : from @xmath82 to @xmath83 mev/@xmath54 around the nominal @xmath79 mass for @xmath79 candidates and from @xmath84 to @xmath85 mev/@xmath54 around the nominal @xmath80 mass for @xmath80 candidates .",
    "candidate @xmath57 mesons are formed by combining @xmath79 and @xmath86 candidates or @xmath80 and @xmath56 candidates . to improve the resolution of the @xmath87 mass difference , @xmath88 , the charged pion track from the @xmath57 is refitted to the @xmath79 decay vertex .",
    "we require @xmath88 to be within 2.5 mev/@xmath54 and 2.0 mev/@xmath54 around nominal @xmath89-@xmath58 mass difference for @xmath90 and @xmath91 decay modes , respectively .",
    "we apply a tighter window in @xmath91 decay mode to suppress large background from fake neutral pions .",
    "to tag semileptonic @xmath7 decays , we combine @xmath57 meson and lepton candidates of opposite electric charge and calculate the cosine of the angle between the momentum of the @xmath7 meson and the @xmath92 system in the @xmath4 rest frame , under the assumption that only one massless particle is not reconstructed : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the energy of the beam , and @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the energy , momentum , and mass of the @xmath92 system , respectively .",

    "correctly reconstructed @xmath7 candidates in the tag and normalization mode @xmath100 are expected to have a value of @xmath101 between @xmath102 and @xmath103 . on the other hand , correctly reconstructed @xmath7 candidates in the signal decay mode @xmath104 or falsely reconstructed @xmath7 candidates would tend to have values of @xmath101 below the physical region due to contributions from additional particles and a large negative correlation with missing mass squared , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is four - momentum of the particles in the @xmath4 rest frame .    in each event we require two tagged @xmath7 candidates that are opposite in flavor .",
    "signal events may have the same flavor due to the @xmath37 mixing , however we veto such events as they lead to ambiguous @xmath92 pair assignment and larger combinatorial background .",
    "we require that at most one @xmath7 meson is reconstructed in a @xmath80 mode , in order to avoid large background from fake neutral pions when forming @xmath89 candidates . in each signal event",
    "we assign the candidate with the lowest value of @xmath101 ( referred to hereafter as @xmath107 ) as @xmath31 .",
    "the probability of falsely assigning the @xmath31 as the @xmath33 for signal events is about 3% . after the identification of the @xmath31 and @xmath33 candidates , we apply further background suppression criteria . on the tag side ( @xmath33 ) we require @xmath108 in order to select @xmath45 . on the signal side",
    "we require the @xmath89 momentum in the @xmath4 rest frame to be less than 2.0 gev/@xmath109 , while we require it to be less than 2.5 gev/@xmath109 on the tag side , which accounts for differing lepton masses .",
    "finally , we require the events to contain no extra charged tracks , @xmath53 candidates , or @xmath56 candidates , which are reconstructed with the same criteria as those used in the @xmath58 candidates . at this stage ,",
    "the probability of finding multiple candidates is 7% , and the average number of candidates is 1.08 .",
    "when multiple candidates are found in an event , we select the most signal - like events based on the quality of vertex - constrained fits for the @xmath58 mesons .",
    "to separate reconstructed signal and normalization events , we employ a neural network approach based on the `` neurobayes '' software package @xcite .",
    "the variables used as inputs to the network are ( i ) @xmath110 , ( ii ) missing mass squared , @xmath111 , and ( iii ) visible energy @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is energies of the particles in the @xmath4 rest frame . the most powerful observable in separating signal and background is @xmath110 . the neural network is trained using mc samples of signal and normalization events .",
    "the most dominant background contribution arises from events with falsely reconstructed ( fake ) @xmath114 mesons .",
    "we categorize events , in which @xmath114 candidates are falsely reconstructed in any events , into fake @xmath114 events .",
    "the next most dominant contributions arise from two sources in which @xmath89 mesons from both @xmath31 and @xmath33 are correctly reconstructed .",
    "one source is @xmath39 , where the @xmath40 decays to @xmath114 along with accompanying particles .",
    "the other source is @xmath115 events , where one @xmath89 meson is correctly reconstructed and the other charmed meson @xmath116 decays via a semileptonic mode .",
    "if the hadrons in the semileptonic @xmath116 decay are not identified , such events can mimic signal .",
    "similarly , when @xmath116 is @xmath117 meson which decays into @xmath118 , such events can also mimic signal . to separate signal and normalization events from background processes",
    ", we use the extra energy , @xmath119 , which is defined as the sum of the energies of neutral clusters detected in the ecl that are not associated with reconstructed particles . to mitigate photons related to beam background in the energy sum , we only include clusters with energies greater than 50 , 100 , and 150 mev for the barrel , forward , and backward calorimeter regions , respectively .",
    "signal and normalization events peak near zero in @xmath119 , while backgrounds populate a wider range .",
    "we require @xmath119 to be less than 1.2 gev .",
    "to improve the accuracy of the mc simulation we apply a series of calibration factors determined from control sample measurements .",
    "the lepton identification efficiencies are corrected for electrons and muons , respectively , to account for differences between the detector responses in data and mc . we reweight events to account for differing @xmath114 yields between data and mc samples .",
    "the differing yields of truly reconstructed @xmath114 mesons between data and mc samples affect @xmath19 measurements through the determination of the backgrounds .",
    "it is difficult to precisely estimate the differing yields of falsely reconstructed @xmath114 mesons between data and mc samples by only using sideband region in two - dimensional of the @xmath58 invariant masses ( @xmath120 ) or @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , calibration factors for events with both correctly and falsely reconstructed @xmath58 mesons are estimated for each @xmath58 meson sub - decay mode using a two - dimensional fit to @xmath120 .",
    "precise calibration can be performed by using samples with two tagged candidates , which have good purity and are close to final samples for the @xmath19 measurement .",
    "a two - dimensional pdf is constructed by taking the product of the one - dimensional functions for @xmath120 .",
    "the function in each dimension is constructed by the sum of the signal component and the background component as modeled by first - order chebychev polynomials .",
    "the signal component is modeled by a triple gaussian for @xmath79 decay modes without a @xmath56 or a crystal ball function @xcite plus a gaussian for @xmath79 decay modes with a @xmath56 and @xmath80 decay modes . in this calibration",
    ", we do not distinguish signal and tag side . to estimate calibration factors for specific @xmath58 sub - decay modes",

    "we can not independently determine calibration factors for all @xmath58 meson sub - decay modes , as we use other sub - decay modes when we calibrate one specific sub - decay mode of a given @xmath58 meson . to estimate all the calibration factors correctly , we first perform the two - dimensional fitting for each sub - decay mode separately",
    ", then repeat the process , weighting samples by the estimated calibration factors , until all calibration factors converge .",
    "similarly , we estimate calibration factors for events with correctly and falsely reconstructed @xmath89 mesons from a two - dimensional fit to @xmath88",
    ". calibration factors for events with correctly and falsely reconstructed @xmath89 mesons are separately estimated for @xmath79 and @xmath80 mesons .",
    "we extract the signal and normalization yields using a two - dimensional extended maximum - likelihood fit in @xmath121 and @xmath119 .",
    "the likelihood function consists of five components : signal , normalization , fake @xmath114 events , @xmath39 , and other backgrounds predominantly from @xmath115 .",
    "the pdfs of all components are determined based on mc simulation .",
    "there are significant correlations between @xmath121 and @xmath119 in the background components , but not for the signal .",

    "the ratio of efficiencies , @xmath125 , is estimated to be @xmath126 from mc simulation .",
    "the difference between reconstruction efficiencies of signal and normalization events arises from their distinct lepton momentum distributions , and the differing event criterion on the @xmath89 momenta on the signal side .",
    "we validate the pdfs used in the fitting procedure by analysing various control samples . for fake @xmath114 events we study the @xmath88 sidebands , where we find good agreement in both @xmath121 and @xmath119 . for @xmath45",

    "the systematic uncertainties are summarized in table  [ tab : systematics ] .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainty arises from the limited size of the mc samples : to estimate this uncertainty , we recalculated pdfs for signal , normalization , fake @xmath114 events , @xmath39 , and other backgrounds by generating toy mc samples from the nominal pdfs according to poisson statistics and repeated the fit with the new pdfs .",
    "small discrepancies between the data and mc are found in the @xmath101 distributions in the hadronic tagged samples .",
    "we correct the @xmath101 distribution in mc samples according to the observed discrepancy and repeat the fit . the estimated uncertainty",
    "are referred as `` pdf shape of the normalization in @xmath101 '' in table  [ tab : systematics ] .",
    "the branching ratios of the @xmath39 decay modes and the decays of the @xmath40 mesons are not well known , and therefore they contribute a large uncertainty in pdf shape of @xmath39",

    "the uncertainties are assumed to be @xmath128 for @xmath41 , @xmath129 for @xmath42 , @xmath130 for @xmath43 , and @xmath131 for @xmath44 , respectively , including limited knowledge of the @xmath40 decays .",
    "furthermore , we consider the impact of contributions from radially excited @xmath132 and @xmath133 , where we consider the assuming branching ratios of @xmath134 to be as much as @xmath135 each . the yields of fake @xmath136 events are fixed to the values estimated from sidebands in the @xmath88 distributions .",
    "we vary the fixed yields of fake @xmath114 events within the uncertainties .",
    "to take into account possible dependence of pdf shape to @xmath58 meson sub - decay mode , we vary the calibration factors for each @xmath58 meson sub - decay mode within their uncertainties for events with falsely reconstructed @xmath114 events .",
    "the yields of other background processes , predominantly from @xmath115 events , are fixed to the values estimated from mc simulation .",
    "we consider variations on the yield and shape of the pdf of these background processes , corresponding to their measured uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainties of each @xmath115 decays are assumed to be @xmath137 for @xmath138 , @xmath139 for @xmath140 , @xmath137 for @xmath141 , and @xmath129 for @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we add an uncertainty of @xmath143 due to the size of the mc sample .",
    "we include an uncertainty on the branching ratio of @xmath144 decay , which may peak near the signal in the @xmath119 distribution : it is found to be negligible .",
    "the reconstruction efficiency ratio of signal to normalization events is varied within its uncertainty , which is limited by the size of mc samples for signal events .",
    "we include other minor systematic uncertainties from two sources .",
    "one is an uncertainty from the parameters that are used for the reweighting of the semileptonic @xmath145 decays from the isgw model to the llsw model .",
