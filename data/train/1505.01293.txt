    "understanding the scaling of the velocity structure functions in turbulent flows is a challenging problem .",
    "such scaling is known to be universal in the inertial range and shows small departures from the behaviour predicted by kolmogorov @xcite . to make progress in understanding the anomalous scaling of the structure functions a model for an advected passive scalar field , the kraichnan model @xcite , turned out to be illuminating (",
    "similar models were considered long time ago by corssin and obukhov @xcite ) .",
    "one of the features which makes this model appealing is that the corrections to the canonical scaling of the structure functions can be analytically computed considering the zero modes of some operator @xmath0 which acts on the equal time correlation functions of the scalar field @xcite .",
    "this result has been obtained via various methods among which the expansion in the hlder exponent appearing in the covariance of the velocity field ( i.e. : the @xmath1 appearing in equation ( [ eq : def_dv_expl ] ) ) , an expansion for large spatial dimension and the batchelor limit ( @xmath1 close to @xmath2 ) @xcite . furthermore the zero modes have been understood as statistical conservation laws @xcite . for a review of the results and a complete discussion we refer to @xcite . in this work",
    "we study the scaling of the structure functions of the kraichnan model by means of the functional renormalization group which offers the advantage of being a very adaptable framework .",
    "the renormalization groups proved to be ideal to understand the anomalous scaling in statistical systems but the applications of its inherent concepts go far beyond .",
    "the functional renormalization group ( frg ) is a functional realization of the wilsonian renormalization program and is applied successfully to many problems regarding out of equilibrium systems , for a review see @xcite and @xcite . in the frg framework one considers a scale dependent effective action , the effective average action ( eaa ) , which interpolates between the classical action and the standard effective action @xcite . within this framework",
    "the issue of a fixed point for the functional integral associated to the randomly stirred navier - stokes equation has been first considered in @xcite and more recently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular in @xcite a fixed point solution of the frg equation associated to this problem has been investigated in @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless there is not still a quantitative prediction for the anomalous exponent of the structure functions and it may turn useful to address this question in a simpler setting .",
    "let us stress that the frg has been proved to be a solid framework in similar problems such as the scaling exponents of the kardar - parisi - zhang equation and its correlation functions in the strong coupling regime @xcite ( see @xcite for the burgers equation ) .",
    "+ @xmath5 the rg analysis of the kraichnan model has been performed in a perturbative framework by means of an @xmath6expansion which is very similar to the one used in the analysis of critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6expansion framework has been applied also to many other problems ranging from the randomly stirred navier - stokes equation to magnetic hydrodynamics , we refer to @xcite and @xcite for a complete list of references .",
    "actually this framework turned out to be very efficient for the kraichnan model and the anomalous exponents of the structure function have been computed up to order @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the inverse and the wilsonian rg and their connection to the zero modes results have been studied in @xcite . in this work",
    "we analyze the frg approach to the kraichnan model ; this allows us to investigate a number of issues in a simpler setting and shows that the frg is a viable framework for the computation of the anomalous exponents for the structure functions .",
    "thus the main purpose of this work is to study in a concrete example the techniques required to understand the scaling of the structure functions in the frg framework and in particular the role of composite operators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the section [ sec : path - integral - formulation ] we introduce the path integral formalism for the model . in section [ sec : functional - renormalization - group ] we consider the relevant rg equations and show how to obtain the latter ones within the frg approach . in section [ sec : the - ir - fixed ] we study the ir fixed point of the model while in section [ sec : rg - flow - of_composite_operators ] we consider the anomalous dimension of the relevant composite operators . in section [ sec : scaling - of - the - sn ] we put together our results and discuss the scaling of the structure functions . in the final section",
    "we summarize our findings and consider possible outlooks .",
    "in this section we recall the definition of the kraichnan model and derive its path integral representation .",
    "the symmetries of the model are described in appendix [ sub : symmetries ] together with some non - renormalization theorems which follow .",
    "let us consider a scalar quantity @xmath8 , e.g. : the temperature , which is advected by a fluid having random velocity @xmath9 .",
    "the equation for the dynamics of @xmath8 is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the molecular diffusivity and @xmath12 is a stochastic forcing term with gaussian statistic and zero average .",
    "note that equation ( [ eq : eom_theta_force ] ) is a stochastic differential equation with multiplicative noise and is interpreted in the stratonovich sense .",
    "more precisely the covariance of the forcing term is : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the characteristic scale of the forcing ( eventually we will denote @xmath15 ) .",
    "the random velocity @xmath9 is also gaussian and has zero average : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the projector onto the transversal components ( the fluid is incompressible ) . throughout this work",
    "we assume the stratonovich discretization prescription for all the relavant formulas unless otherwise stated .",
    "note that the mass @xmath18 in the denominator avoids ir divergences and is a further scale besides @xmath14 , which appears in the force correlator .",
    "actually in the inertial regime the structure functions do not depend on @xmath18 and we set @xmath18 to zero ( if one wanted to it is easy to keep this parameter )",
    ". we will not need to introduce @xmath18 at all since the frg framework is safe from ir divergences by construction .",
    "averages can be computed via the following path integral : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a solution of equation ( [ eq : eom_theta_force ] ) and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the gaussian weighting factors of @xmath12 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "we have : @xmath24 where the determinant comes from the change of variables in the path integral . for the time being we shall neglect this determinant and we will come back to it in a moment : @xmath25\\\\   & = & \\int{\\cal d}\\bar{\\theta}{\\cal d}v{\\cal d}\\theta e^{+\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\bar{\\theta}\\langle ff\\rangle\\bar{\\theta}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\int v\\langle vv\\rangle^{-1}v } \\\\ &",

    "the determinant in equation ( [ eq : z_and_det ] ) is very similar to the one encountered in the path integral representation of the langevin equation , see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "such determinant depends on the convention chosen for heaviside theta function in zero : if @xmath28 we are considering the ito calculus while if @xmath29 we are considering stratonovich .",
    "in particular , as shown in @xcite , using ito discretization prescription the determinant does not enter in the path integral and the action has the same form of the action @xmath30 defined in equation ( [ eq : def_stheta ] ) below but with a different molecular diffusivity .",
    "as we already said in this work we will follow stratonovich discretization prescription and we shall include the determinant contribution in the action via two grassmann odd fields which we refer to as ghosts .",
    "such choice may seem somehow more complicated since it doubles the number of fields .",
    "nevertheless we would like to keep such ghost fields since they carry a physical and geometrical meaning in the path integral approach to classical mechanics @xcite and make manifest the supersymmetry in stochastic processes , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the ghost action associated to the determinant is simply : @xmath31 the full action is thus composed of two parts : @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "\\label{eq : def_stheta }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the field @xmath26 is the response field present in the martin - siggia - rose formalism @xcite , see also @xcite , and that @xmath34 and @xmath32 are very similar due to the fact that equation ( [ eq : eom_theta_force ] ) is linear in @xmath35 . thus the stochastic problem in equation ( [ eq : eom_theta_force ] ) has been mapped to the field theory coming from expression ( [ eq : z_and_det ] ) .",
    "now we are able to exploit the techniques available for standard field theory and in particular we will employ the functional renormalization group discussed in the next section .",
    "finally let us recall the dimension of the various quantities entering in the action , we have @xmath36=t^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath37=l^{-d}t^{-1/2}$ ] , @xmath38=\\frac{l^{2}}{t}l^{-\\varepsilon}$ ] and @xmath39=\\frac{l^{2}}{t}$ ] .",
    "following @xcite we define @xmath40 which has dimensions @xmath41=l^{-\\varepsilon}$ ] .",
    "functional renormalization group provides a non perturbative framework for the implementation of the wilsonian integration of high momentum modes . for a general introduction",
    "we refer the reader to the following list of reviews @xcite .",
    "we will work via the effective average action ( eaa ) which is a scale dependent generalization of the standard effective action .",
    "one first define a modified generating functional of connected green s function @xmath42 : @xmath43 } & = & \\int{\\cal d}\\chi e^{-s-\\delta s_{k}+j\\chi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 suppresses the integration of momentum modes @xmath45 and is quadratic in the fields with a kernel @xmath46 , i.e. : @xmath47 .",
    "note that this acts like an infrared cutoff .",
    "thus let @xmath48 be the legendre transform of @xmath42 and define the eaa subtracting the cutoff action which we added at the beginning : @xmath49 the @xmath50dependence of the functional @xmath51 satisfy the following exact equation @xcite @xmath52\\ , \\label{eq : flow_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the logarithmic derivative with respect to the cutoff and @xmath54 is the hessian of the eaa . to concretely employ equation ( [ eq : flow_eq ] )",
    "we will need to resort to some approximations and we will make an ansatz for @xmath51 . such procedure has been proved robust in many fields , especially to determine the scaling of statistical system at criticality , see @xcite for an overview .",
    "equation ( [ eq : flow_eq ] ) will provide the running for the couplings in our ansatz .",
    "nevertheless we are also interested in the running of composite operators . to derive the flow equation for composite operators let us consider the one loop case .",
    "besides the cutoff term let us add to the action a source @xmath1 coupled to a composite operator @xmath55 , then the one loop eaa reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the hessians for the action and the composite operator respectively .",
    "if we now derive the above expression with respect to the scale @xmath59 we obtain : @xmath60 finally , in order to derive the running of the composite operator , we just need to take a functional derivative with respect to the source @xmath1 and set this to zero : @xmath61 the exact flow equation for the running of the composite operator can be found from the above expression just by `` rg - improving '' the one - loop case ( exactly as it happens with the eaa ) . to see this",
    "explicitly we consider that , given a modified action @xmath62 , both the connected green s function generating functional @xmath63 $ ] and its legendre transform @xmath64 $ ] depend on the source @xmath1 . in particular from the definition of @xmath65 and @xmath66 we have @xmath67 = \\int \\varphi j - w_k\\left [ j , \\varepsilon \\right ] - \\delta s_k \\left [ \\varphi \\right ] \\,.\\ ] ] in order to extract information regarding the composite operator @xmath55 we simply take a functional derivative with respect to @xmath1 and observe that @xmath68 \\bigr|_{\\varepsilon = 0 } = - \\frac{\\delta w_k\\left [ j , \\varepsilon \\right]}{\\delta \\varepsilon \\left ( x \\right ) }    \\bigr|_{\\varepsilon = 0 } \\,.\\ ] ] this equation tells us that the running composite operator @xmath69_k $ ] is directly related to the @xmath70 $ ] via a functional derivative with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "the flow equation for @xmath70 $ ] is simply given by equation ( [ eq : flow_eq ] ) where the usual eaa is replaced with the @xmath6dependent eaa .",
    "thus the running of the first functional derivative of @xmath70 $ ] with respect to @xmath1 can be directly obtained from ( [ eq : flow_eq ] ) and , setting @xmath71 at the end , one obtains : @xmath72 .",
    "\\label{eq : flow_eq_composite_op}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : flow_eq_composite_op ] ) will give back a differential equation to which a suitable boundary condition is associated .",
    "typically one defines the composite operator of interest at some scale @xmath73 .",
    "clearly the rg evolution generally produces mixing among different operators and the composite operator has to be parametrized choosing a suitable ansatz . for a detailed discussion on the flow equation for composite operators we refer to @xcite .",
    "let us come back to the kraichnan model .",
    "we choose the cutoff kernel @xmath46 as @xmath74 the matrix acts on the following vector in field space : @xmath75 . as common in the application of frg to non - equilibrium systems",
    "we have chosen an off - diagonal cutoff for the response field and its companion ( e.g. : @xmath26 and @xmath35 respectively ) .",
    "moreover we do not cutoff the frequency since we will be able to perform integration over frequency analytically .",
    "note that adding the cutoff may break some of the symmetries analysed in appendix [ sub : symmetries ] .",
    "of course at the fixed point the scaling behaviour does not depend on the form of the cutoff but breaking some symmetries in the middle of the flow means that more terms have to be taken into account .",
    "it is clear that if we consider @xmath76 where @xmath77 , none of the symmetry is broken and in particular shift symmetry is preserved .",
    "if we chose the optimized cutoff @xcite @xmath78 shift symmetry would be broken .",
    "we are interested in the scaling of structure functions @xmath79 of the field @xmath35 at equal time , i.e. : @xmath80 clearly @xmath81 is given by a product of several different composite operators and to determine the scaling behaviour of @xmath81 is a rather difficult task .",
    "it is convenient to reason in terms of single composite operators expressing @xmath81 via the operator product expansion ( ope ) , or short distance expansion .",
    "such program works nicely in the @xmath6expansion framework in @xcite and we will follow closely this procedure . here",
    "the main idea is to identify the operators which determine the scaling in such a way to be able to apply the frg framework afterwards .",
    "first of all let us consider the simplest case of @xmath82 and recall that the canonical dimension of the field is @xmath36=t^{1/2}$ ] . for dimensional reason",
    "thus we have : @xmath83 \\nonumber \\\\   &   & + t^{-1}c_{3}\\left(\\mu_{t}t,\\mu x\\right)\\left[\\theta^{4}\\right]+\\cdots + d_{1}\\left(\\mu_{t}t,\\mu x\\right)x^{2}\\left[\\partial\\theta\\partial\\theta\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\   &   & + t^{-1 } d_{2}\\left(\\mu_{t}t,\\mu x\\right)x^{4}\\left[\\left(\\partial\\theta\\partial\\theta\\right)^{2}\\right]+\\cdots\\,.\\label{eq : generic_ope_s2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that odd terms in @xmath35 are not allowed by @xmath84symmetry .",
    "moreover both the path integral and the correlation function in @xmath79 are shift invariant . as a consequence",
    "the operators entering in the ope are also shift invariant , i.e. : only derivatives of @xmath35 appear and all the terms in the first line , except the first one , vanish .",
    "finally let us recall that we are considering equal time correlators and so @xmath85 must be set to zero .",
    "now , if we make the hypothesis that the time dependence of the various terms entering in ( [ eq : generic_ope_s2 ] ) is not dramatically different from the canonical one , we can observe that for @xmath86 some terms vanish , some others stay finite and some diverge .",
    "we assume that the divergent terms are eliminated from the renormalization procedure so that only finite terms remain . at this point",
    "we note that only operators like @xmath87 are relevant in ( [ eq : generic_ope_s2 ] ) , i.e. : operators which are not multiplied by overall factors of @xmath85 . in full",
    "analogy one can argue that for @xmath81 the relevant composite operator is @xmath88 .",
    "this reasoning is at best heuristic and can be better justified by diagrammatic considerations as presented in @xcite where it is shown that only composite operators with at most @xmath89 @xmath90fields appear in the ope of @xmath81 . here",
    "our main message is that the ope suggests that the scaling of the structure functions is encoded in the scaling of some particular composite operators whose leading term in a derivative expansion is @xmath88 .",
    "note that this is the operator you get from a simple taylor expansion of @xmath81 .    in order to derive the formula for the anomalous dimension of a composite operator @xmath55 we consider the callan - symanzik equation and implement renormalization multipling the operator by a coupling @xmath91 .",
    "let us consider the coupling appearing in @xmath34 and @xmath92 , the callan - symanzik equation reads : @xmath93 where we used the fact @xmath94 is not renormalized and thus does not enter in the equation and @xmath95 .",
    "moreover from dimensional analysis ( in space and time ) we have @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the frequency and mass dimensions of the operator @xmath55 .",
    "now let us plug ( [ eq : callansymanzik_o ] ) in ( [ eq : x_dim_analysis_o ] ) , we obtain @xmath99 now we insert ( [ eq : t_dim_analysis_o ] ) in the above relation and find @xmath100 finally it is convenient to re - express the flow via the coupling @xmath40 and to observe that we can rewrite the beta function of @xmath11 via @xmath101 exploiting the fact that @xmath94 is not renormalized : @xmath102 now we replace @xmath103 using equation ( [ eq : t_dim_analysis_o ] ) and we express @xmath104 via its dimensionless counterpart @xmath105 .",
    "note that @xmath106 and so @xmath107 at a non  gaussian fixed point .",
    "now we plug this in equation ( [ eq : csmanipulations_1 ] ) : @xmath108 this equation will be used in section [ sec : scaling - of - the - sn ] to derive the scaling of various composite operators and to determine the scaling of the structure functions .",
    "summarizing we have introduced the frg framework for the couplings and for the composite operators .",
    "thus we used the ope to identify which is the most important operator which contributes to the scaling of the structure function .",
    "in this section we derive the ir fixed point whose scaling will be studied in the next sections .",
    "the presence of an ir fixed point for the kraichnan model is known from @xmath6expansion in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is argued that the beta function of @xmath101 , which is the coupling we choose to parametrize the rg flow , is one loop exact .",
    "thus we will first perform a one loop computation within the frg framework and afterwards we will comment on how the fact that the beta function of @xmath101 is one loop exact can be understood from an frg perspective .",
    "we start by considering the ansatz : @xmath109\\,.\\label{eq:1loop_eaa_ansatz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to evaluate the running of @xmath11 it is convenient to consider the flow equation for the functional derivatives of @xmath51 .",
    "in particular we derive the flow equation ( [ eq : flow_eq ] ) with respect to @xmath35 and @xmath26 and extract the term proportional to the momentum square . the central object in the flow equation is the hessian of the eaa which in field space and at zero field reads @xmath110 thus the regularized propagator @xmath111 has the form @xmath112 in particular we have @xmath113 schematically the flow equation for two point function has the following form : @xmath114\\,.\\label{eq : generic_2point_flow_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the term in the third line does not contribute since there is no such vertex in the ansatz ( [ eq:1loop_eaa_ansatz ] ) .",
    "thus we find that @xmath115 where @xmath116 denotes the vertex coming from the term @xmath117 in the action . equation ( [ eq : flow_kappa_with_gprop ] ) can be written in a diagrammatic fashion as shown in figure [ img : kappa_gvv_gttb_gvv ] .    ) . ]",
    "note that there are further contributions to the flow equation for the two point function but they vanish upon integration over the frequency ( see appendix [ sec : appendix :- some - frequency ] for some details on the frequency integration ) .",
    "these diagrams are shown in figure [ img : kappa_gttb_gvv_gttb ] .     which vanish after frequency integration . ]",
    "the final result is : @xmath118 if we use the exponential cutoff ( [ eq : def_exp_cutoff ] ) in the above equation we obtain @xmath119\\right)\\label{eq : rhs_kappa_exp_cutoff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for the optimized cutoff ( [ eq : def_litim_cutoff ] ) @xmath120 the fact that beta functions coming from ( [ eq : rhs_kappa_exp_cutoff ] ) and ( [ eq : rhs_kappa_litim_cutoff ] ) are slightly different has to be expected since the beta functions are scheme dependent and using different cutoffs corresponds to a change of scheme in the frg language .",
    "scheme independence has to be recovered in physical quantities like the critical exponents as we will check in a moment . in this case",
    "it is convenient to parametrize the flow via the coupling @xmath40 and to introduce its dimensionless analogue @xmath121 .",
    "note that the flow equation ( [ eq : flow_eq_kappa_dim_int ] ) has the following generic form @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a constant which depend on the dimension and on @xmath1 . in term of the dimensionless coupling @xmath124",
    "the above equation reads : @xmath125 the ir fixed point thus reads @xmath126 and the critical exponent is @xmath127 independently of the cutoff .",
    "let us compare our procedure with the one adopted in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the authors set up a field theoretic framework analogous to the one we have seen in section [ sec : path - integral - formulation ] .",
    "the only difference being the fact that the ghost fields are not present .",
    "the one loop correction to the molecular diffusivity is computed and the diagram is uv convergent .",
    "however when @xmath128 a divergence appears . in full analogy with dimensional regularization",
    "the authors perform an @xmath6expansion and subtract the poles .",
    "this leads to a prescription for the rg flow which can be used to obtain a resummed result .",
    "when one performs this @xmath6expansion one notes that the scale @xmath18 disappears from the leading expression proportional to @xmath129 and disappears from the flow equations .",
    "in our case we simply set @xmath130 from the very beginning .",
    "note that in comparison to other works in the literature there are two main differences .",
    "first the velocity covariance ( [ eq : def_dv_expl ] ) adopted in this work and in @xcite differs from the one used in other works since the coefficient @xmath131 in ( [ eq : def_dv_expl ] ) is replaced with @xmath132 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "moreover the problem can be represented using the ito discretization prescription in place of the stratonovich one . with this definition",
    "the velocity covariance is finite in the limit @xmath128 and the previously mentioned divergence for @xmath128 is not present @xcite . in this case",
    "the rg flow of the action is trivial and non - trivial flows can be found for composite fields like @xmath133 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details on the use of ito prescription and the rg flows found in this case .",
    "finally in @xcite it is argued that the beta function of @xmath124 is one - loop exact . to understand how",
    "this should be interpreted in the frg scheme let us consider again the ansatz ( [ eq:1loop_eaa_ansatz ] ) and plug this in the flow equation for the two point function .",
    "we want to understand if further terms are generated by the rg flow or not .",
    "it is immediate to note that no further term is generated : the `` trace factor '' found by contracting the vertices with the propagator is @xmath134 and the propagator @xmath135 ( which depends on @xmath136 ) loses its @xmath137dependence after the frequency integration . as a consequence the only @xmath137dependence comes from the trace factor .",
    "this means that the l.h.s . and r.h.s . of ( [ eq : flow_kappa_with_gprop ] ) are proportional to @xmath138 , a very uncommon fact in frg computations",
    "one can be even more general and start from the following ansatz @xmath139\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] repeating the same steps the flow equation itself tells that @xmath140 . we interpret this as an argument telling us that the beta function of @xmath101 is one - loop exact .",
    "clearly one may consider even more general ansatzs which are consistent with all the symmetries we analyzed in appendix [ sub : symmetries ] .",
    "for example one can add higher powers in the fields via terms like : @xmath141 we will not consider such terms but these terms should be taken into account in a more complete computation .",
    "in this section we study the scaling of the structure function at the ir fixed point found in section [ sec : the - ir - fixed ] .",
    "we will first study the renormalization of the operator @xmath142 and then we will move to consider @xmath143 . the results found in this section",
    "will be used in section [ sec : scaling - of - the - sn ] to obtain the correction to the scaling of @xmath81 .",
    "in section [ sec : functional - renormalization - group ] we argued that the scaling of the structure functions @xmath81 is encoded in the scaling of the composite operator @xmath142 .",
    "the argument is based on the ope of @xmath81 .",
    "let us stress that if we take into account only the operator @xmath142 we are making an approximation since other operators also contribute , e.g. : @xmath144 .",
    "in this sense we apply the logic of the derivative expansion to the composite operator coming from the ope of @xmath81 .    from now on we focus on the rg flow of the operator @xmath145 .",
    "to compute its running we introduce a coupling @xmath91 which multiplies @xmath55 and use equation ( [ eq : flow_eq_composite_op ] ) . to extract the running of @xmath91 we perform @xmath89 functional derivatives with respect to @xmath35 and set all the fields to zero .",
    "thus l.h.s .",
    "is proportional to @xmath146 and has to be compared with the terms also proportional to @xmath146 obtained by taking @xmath89 functional derivatives of the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : flow_eq_composite_op ] ) .",
    "note that the hessian of the operator @xmath55 appears in equation ( [ eq : flow_eq_composite_op ] ) and @xmath147 functional derivatives will act on it while the remaining two will act on the regularized propagators of the eaa .",
    "moreover the l.h.s . of the equation",
    "is proportional to @xmath148 while the r.h.s . to @xmath91",
    "so it will be easy to extract the anomalous dimension @xmath149 . the flow equation obtained in this way",
    "can be represented diagrammatically as in figures [ img : op_gvv_gttb_gttb_gvv ] , [ img : op_gttb_gttb_gvv_gttb ] and [ img : op_gttb_gvv_gttb_gttb ] where the black dot denotes the insertion of the hessian of the composite operator with @xmath147 functional derivatives attached .",
    "we limit ourselves to consider the leading term in the @xmath6expansion of the structure function which amounts to a one loop computation .",
    "our main objective is to test the tools introduced so far and reproduce the known leading correction . in each diagram",
    "the `` trace factor '' between the vertices and the velocity projector gives @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the cosine between the external and the loop momentum .",

    "let us note that differently from what we have seen in section [ sec : the - ir - fixed ] the r.h.s",
    ". of the flow equation for composite operators generates new terms .",
    "indeed it is possible to verify that terms of higher power in @xmath153 are generated expanding those propagators which are function of @xmath159 .",
    "this means that , within our approximation , the system is not closed .",
    "this is a common problem in the frg approach and the crucial point is to parametrize the quantities of interest with sufficiently many terms . here , retaining just one operator , we did a rather crude approximation and this precludes for instance the possibility of extracting correct values of the anomalous dimension for large values of @xmath1",
    ". however we stress that hopefully such difficulties can be solved by employing larger truncations as usually happens in the frg applications . in order to understand",
    "if this methodology is efficient for the kraichnan model one should increase the truncation and check the stability of the results .",
    "this however is beyond the scope of the present work .      besides the anomalous dimension of the operator @xmath142 it is useful to consider also the anomalous dimension of operators @xmath143 .",
    "it turns out that the anomalous of @xmath143 dimension is zero . to see this we consider the flow equation for the composite operator @xmath143 which is fully analogous to the one for @xmath142 .",
    "one only needs to change the `` composite operator vertex '' in the diagrams .",

    "the flow equation for @xmath161 is zero .    as an aside comment",

    "we use the results of sections [ sec : the - ir - fixed ] and [ sec : rg - flow - of_composite_operators ] in order to derive the running of the structure functions . to achieve this",
    "we will consider the ope of @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "let us note that @xmath167 repeating the same steps which lead to equation ( [ eq : scaling_composite_operator ] ) we obtain that all the terms in the above sum satisfy the following equation @xmath168\\langle\\theta{}^{2n - k}\\theta{}^{k}\\rangle & = & 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath169 .",
    "this tells us that @xmath170 in order to understand the @xmath171dependence in @xmath81 we consider the ope . in section [ sec : functional - renormalization - group ] we argued that the leading term in the ope of @xmath81 is given by @xmath142 thus @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the first wilson coefficient of the expansion , a function of @xmath174 , and @xmath142 is a composite operator in @xmath175 .",
    "thus we have @xmath176 where @xmath177 is a constant in the sense that it does not dependent on any coordinates .",
    "now we consider equation ( [ eq : scaling_composite_operator ] ) for the above correlation and deduce that @xmath178 where we used the fact that @xmath177 does not depend on any coordinates .",
    "this tells us that @xmath179 finally we suppose that the wilson coefficient @xmath173 does not depend on @xmath180 in the limit @xmath181 , i.e. : that @xmath173 is regular in @xmath180 .",
    "note that the limit @xmath181 , i.e. : @xmath182 , is justified by the fact that we are studying the inertial regime of the system .",
    "this tells us that the whole @xmath171dependence in @xmath81 is given by expression ( [ eq : m_dependence_s2n ] ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath183 where @xmath184 this is the leading correction found in @xcite via the zero mode approach and in @xcite via the @xmath6expansion .",
    "let us note that we can derive the scaling of @xmath81 also via the following reasoning .",
    "since @xmath177 does not depend on @xmath185 we can limit ourselves to study the @xmath186dependence in @xmath81 studying the wilson coefficient @xmath173 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath173 is regular in @xmath180 and consider the @xmath181 limit .",
    "the callan - symanzik equation for the wilson coefficient is : @xmath187 where we used the fact that the anomalous dimension of the composite operators @xmath188 and @xmath189 are zero .",
    "once again we repeat the steps which lead to equation ( [ eq : scaling_composite_operator ] ) and obtain @xmath190 thus we obtain @xmath191 where the exponent is exactly the one coming from the sum of the exponents in ( [ eq : scaling_s2n_rmr ] ) .",
    "we have explored the application of the frg framework to the kraichnan model . in particular",
    "we studied the scaling of the structure functions in the kraichnan model and reproduced the leading corrections by means of frg techniques . from the field",
    "theoretical point of view the structure functions are correlations of composite operators .",
    "thus in section [ sec : functional - renormalization - group ] we recalled how to compute the running of composite operators using the flow equation for the eaa . in section",
    "[ sec : the - ir - fixed ] and [ sec : rg - flow - of_composite_operators ] we studied the ir fixed point of the model and the anomalous dimensions of various composite operators at the fixed point .",
    "the scaling of the structure functions in the kraichnan model has been found in section [ sec : scaling - of - the - sn ] using the ope .",
    "the path integral formulation adopted in this work has been explained in section [ sec : path - integral - formulation ] while the associated symmetries and some non  renormalization theorems are discussed in appendix [ sub : symmetries ] . in the path integral formulation of the problem",
    "a determinant naturally arises and we kept track of this by expressing the determinant via the integration over some ghost fields .",
    "the ghost sector carries two new symmetries which we called brs symmetry ( mixing @xmath35 and @xmath192 ) and ghost symmetry .",
    "these symmetries are very similar to the ones present in the path integral formulation for classical mechanics @xcite . in the latter case",
    "more symmetries are present , this is due to the fact that the equations of motion for the kraichnan model are not hamiltonian",
    ". let us note that the navier  stokes equation can be formulated as hamiltonian equations of motion setting the viscosity to zero and using the so called clebsh variables .",
    "it may turn out interesting to study the role of the symmetries and of the rg flow in this context .",
    "moreover , as far as classical mechanics is concerned , the ghost fields carry information on the lyapunov exponents of the system and thus on the chaoticity / stochasticity of the system @xcite and we feel that they could play a role also in the path integral approach to turbulence . here",
    "we limit ourselves to note that in the kraichnan model the equation of motion for the ghost @xmath193 corresponds to unforced solutions which are the ones involved in the zero mode approach .",
    "we hope to study these topics in the future .",
    "finally we would like to stress that the techniques adopted in this work can be applied to more complicated systems , for instance the randomly stirred navier  stokes equation .",
    "on general grounds this will require to fully exploit the functional character of the flow equation in order to be able to account for an infinite dimensional ansatz and not to rely on the derivative expansion .",
    "this has been achieved successfully in the case of the kardar - parisi - zhang equation in @xcite . in the kraichnan model",
    "the situation is somehow simpler since the ir fixed point is perturbative for small @xmath1 and the beta function of @xmath101 is one loop exact @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we believe that the logic adopted here , especially with regards to composite operators , can be used in other contexts and more work is needed in this direction .",
    "the advantage of the frg framework is that it does not rely on a perturbative expansion and that genuinely non  perturbative results can be obtained provided that the eaa is parametrized with sufficient accuracy . in particular",
    "we hope that a similar framework to the one adopted in this work may be applied to more complicated situations , like the navier  stokes equation .",
    "the author acknowledges the support of the foundation blanceflor boncompagni ludovisi , ne bildt .",
    "the author is grateful to martin reuter for helpful discussions .",
    "in this appendix we consider the symmetries associated to the krainchnan model .",
    "we first consider the symmetries associated to the action @xmath34 which can be easily extended to the ghost action .",
    "finally we consider symmetries coming from non trivial cancellation in @xmath194 . from these symmetries",
    "we will be able to derive some non - renormalization theorems .",
    "such program has been carried out in great detail for the kardar - parisi - zhang equation in @xcite and more recently for the navier - stokes equation in @xcite . in these cases",
    "the analysis showed that symmetries entail important constraints on the rg flow . here",
    "we perform a similar analysis also including the ghost sector .",
    "the action is symmetric under a sort of @xmath195 transformation : @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "this tells us that there is an even number of @xmath35 and @xmath26 fields in any monomial of the effective action .",
    "moreover it is easy to verify the invariance under constant shift in @xmath35 @xmath198 clearly this property is enjoyed also by the effective action . in analogy with what has been done in @xcite",
    "we consider a time dependent shift : @xmath199 this is not a symmetry but the bare action is non - invariant just by a term which is linear in field space . in particular",
    "the only time derivative appears in @xmath200 since the non - invariance of the action is given just by a term which is linear in the field we can derive the following ward idendity ( wi):$ ] and @xmath201 . thus @xmath202 . ]",
    "@xmath203 this equation tells us that the term in the bare action @xmath204 does not get renormalized .",
    "moreover the action and the effective action also enjoy galilei invariance as we will see in a moment .",
    "thus we can infer that the term @xmath205 is not renormalized .",
    "we also consider a time dependent shift in the response field @xmath206 and we have @xmath207 this entails the non - renormalization of the term @xmath208 .",
    "now we consider the galilei invariance of the model , the transformation is : @xmath209 this invariance tells us that time derivative actually appears via galilei covariant derivative of the form @xmath210 .",
    "note that the term quadratic in the velocities is not straightforwardly invariant .",
    "this is due to the fact that the average velocity is set to zero , in order to see directly galilei invariance we must express the kinetic term as @xmath211 . more precisely it turns out very useful also to consider the following time gauged galilei transformation : @xmath212 we observe that @xmath213\\\\   &   & + \\left(v_{t , x - c\\left(t\\right)}+\\partial_{t}c\\left(t\\right)\\right)\\partial_{x}\\theta_{t , x - c\\left(t\\right)}\\\\   & = & \\left[\\left(\\partial_{t}+v\\partial_{x}\\right)\\theta\\right]^{\\prime}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that this is a symmetry of the equation ( [ eq : eom_theta_force ] ) itself which is not preserved by the averaging over the velocities . indeed performing a transformation in the path integral we obtain @xmath214",
    "this entails the non - renormalization of the `` kinetic '' term for the velocity fields .",
    "thus we observe that the effective action is invariant under the time  gauged version of the galilei transformations except for the quadratic term in the velocity field .",
    "all these non - renormalization theorems are known in the perturbative framework , see @xcite .",
    "so far we have been considering symmetries which do not rely on the presence of the ghost .",
    "indeed @xmath34 and @xmath32 are both simultaneously invariant .",
    "now we examine symmetries which exploit a non - trivial cancellation between @xmath34 and @xmath32 .",
    "let us note that the action can be rewritten as @xmath215 where @xmath216 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath217 is a symmetry which we call brs symmetry in analogy to nomenclature in @xcite .",
    "this symmetry has been discussed in @xcite and we briefly review it here .",
    "the symmetry transformation is linear and thus the brs invariance is present also in the effective action . to derive some useful results",
    "we can consider @xmath218 for some particular operators .",
    "for instance we can consider @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "finally we have also the following symmetry : @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "this symmetry entails the ghost number conservation .",
    "in this appendix we provide a list of the typical frequency integral we have encountered .",
    "these integral come from the multiplication of various @xmath223propagator entering in each diagram .",
    "the regularized propagator has the following form : @xmath224 first of all we consider @xmath225 this integral is divergent but its principal value is well defined :      moreover we need @xmath227 the first integral above is somewhat unusual in the this type of computations , since one typically finds @xmath228 this happens because our diagrams contains not only @xmath223propagator but also velocity propagators ( which are delta in time ) .",
