    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) is a signature characteristic of the strong interaction spectrum and it is a feature of qcd that can only be understood via nonperturbative analysis.in this connection one particularly insightful tool is the qcd gap equation ; i.e. , the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse )  @xcite for the dressed - quark self - energy : @xmath2 in eq .",
