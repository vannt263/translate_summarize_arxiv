    "the korean vlbi network ( kvn ) is the first mm - dedicated very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) network in east asia , aiming to study the formation and death of stars , the structure and dynamics of our own galaxy , and the nature of active galactic nuclei ( agns )  @xcite .",
    "simultaneous multi - frequency vlbi observations using the multi - frequency band receiver systems  @xcite will enable us to conduct observational studies with high spatial and temporal resolution based on the technique of multi - frequency phase referencing  @xcite .",
    "the kvn project was started in 2001 by the korea astronomy and space science institute ( kasi ) with the construction of three 21-m radio telescopes in seoul , ulsan and jeju island , korea ; kvn yonsei radio telescope ( kvnys ) , kvn ulsan radio telescope ( kvnus ) , and kvn tanma radio telescope ( kvntn ) .",
    "the telescopes are located on the campuses of yonsei university ( seoul ) , ulsan university ( ulsan ) , and tamna university ( jeju island ) .",
    "kvn can operate simultaneously in two radio frequency bands , 22 and 43ghz , and will be upgraded for simultaneous four - frequency observations including the higher frequencies at 86 and 129ghz .",
    "the maximum baseline length is @xmath18 480 km and the maximum angular resolution at the highest operating frequency ( 129ghz ) is @xmath18 1milliarcsecond ( mas ) .",
    "a single dish first light was received by the kvn yonsei radio telescope on 30 august , 2008 . following the single - dish performance evaluation observations ,",
    "all three radio telescopes of kvn are now operational , and actively operated for single - dish observations of @xmath19 , sio , and methanol maser sources and extragalactic compact radio sources  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we introduce the general aspects of the radio telescopes of the new mm - vlbi network and describe the results of the performance evaluation observations . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe general aspects of observing systems of the korean vlbi network .",
    "we report the results of the performance evaluation observations for the single dish radio telescopes in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "some astronomical results using kvn radio telescopes are described .",
    "our results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "the kvn project aimed to build the first millimeter - dedicated vlbi network in korea .",
    "kvn has a unique observing system , allowing simultaneous multi - frequency single polarization oberving in up to four frequency bands : 22 , 43 , 86 , and 129ghz or simultaneous multi - frequency dual polarization observing in two frequency bands out of four .",
    "a new millimeter - wave receiver optics system with three frequency - selective surfaces ( dichroic filters ) is an essential part of the unique system @xcite . in this section",
    "we describe the main technical features of the kvn antennas and the observing system .",
    "the three 21-m antennas of kvn have been constructed by kasi under a contract with an american company , antedo , inc . , and a korean company , highgain from 2004 to 2008 .",
    "the antennas are located at university campuses which have the well - developed infrastructures and yield the optimal vlbi baselines for the korean vlbi network in the korean pennisula .",
    "the main design features of the reflectors are determined by the fact that the antennas manintain a high surface accuracy of @xmath20 m rms and a pointing accuracy of @xmath214 arcsecond at wind speeds @xmath2110m / sec , and the aperture efficiency should be high enough ( e.g. , @xmath1860% at 100ghz ) as a mm - dedicated vlbi network .",
    "the kvn antennas are therefore designed to be a shaped cassegrain - type antenna with an alt - az mount ( figure  [ fig - ant ] ) .",
    "the telescope has a 21-m diameter main reflector with a focal length of 6.78 m .",
    "the main reflector consists of 200 aluminium panels with a manufacturing surface accuracy of @xmath22 m .",
    "the slewing speed of the main reflector is @xmath23 , which enables fast position - switching observations .",
    "the subreflector position , tilt , and tip are remotely controlled and modeled to compensate for the gravitaional deformation of the main reflector and for the sagging - down of the subreflector itself .",
    "the characteristics of the antenna systems are summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "a millimeter - wave receiver optics system with three frequency - selective surfaces ( dichroic filters ) is an essential component of the unique system enabling simultaneous multi - frequency vlbi observations in four frequency bands , 22 , 43 , 86 and 129ghz .",
    "the new receiver optics system has been desribed by @xcite , and only its salient features will be described in this section .    in order to make simultaneous observations in the four frequency bands ,",
    "receiver optics system was deveploped to split one signal into four using three low pass filters with nominal cutoffs at 30 , 70 , and 108ghz , made of multi - layer metal meshes .",
    "the beam passing through the filter must have a large size .",
    "furthermore since each band is to provide dual polarization observation the receiver optics should generate as little cross - polarization as possible . as usual with shaped cassegrain",
    "antenna optics , the edge illumination at subreflector by the receiver optics should be about 17db i.e. less than 12db in conventional cassegrain antenna optics , which leads to 2% spillover loss , resulting in higher illumination efficiency than obtainable from conventional cassegrain optics fed with a scalar horn . satisfying such requirements",
    "usually conflicts with physical space available inside an antenna cabin .",
    "the layout of the complete receiver optics is shown in figure  [ layout ] .",
    "this configuration was determined iteratively using standard quasioptical theory  @xcite rather than computationally intensive physical optics method .",
    "the beam from the subreflector comes downwards to the top of the 45@xmath24 flat mirror .",
    "a microwave absorber may be inserted between the flat mirror and the first low pass filter for system calibration based on the chopper - wheel method  @xcite .",
    "the beam from the flat mirror may be reflected , pass through , or be filtered by three mode selectors which consist of a flat mirror , a hole ( or free space ) , and a low pass filter ( lpf ) .",
    "lpf1 ( dichroic , cutoff@xmath1870ghz ) reflects the beam for the 86/129ghz branches and lets the beam for the 22/43ghz branches pass through .",
    "likewise lpf2 ( cutoff@xmath1830ghz ) and lpf3 ( cutoff@xmath18108ghz ) split beams into 22/43ghz and 86/129ghz respectively . the 86 and 129ghz receivers and their corresponding quasioptical systems are currently being installed at three telescopes .",
    "corrugated horns for 86 and 129ghz are to be located inside cryogenic dewars while horns for 22 and 43ghz reside outside the respective dewars .",
    "the signal losses due to the dichroic filters were measured to be @xmath25(lpf1 ) , @xmath26(lpf2 ) , @xmath27(lpf1+lpf2 ) for the 22ghz - band and @xmath25(lpf1 ) , @xmath28(lpf2 ) , @xmath29(lpf1+lpf2 ) for the 43ghz - band  ( table [ tbl - lpf ] ) .",
    "the 22 and 43ghz band signals separated in the quasioptical system are coupled into the corrugated feed horns and receivers which have been built at kasi .",
    "the observing frequency bands for the receivers are 21.25 - 23.25ghz and 42.11 - 44.11ghz , respectively .",
    "both receivers are dual circular polarization , cooled hemt receivers .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : rx ] , lhcp ( left handed circular polarization ) and rhcp ( right handed circular polarization ) components of the signals are separated in septum polarizers inside the dewar of each receiver .",
    "the inp hemt amplifiers made by caltech and nrao are used as the first stage lna ( low noise amplifier ) for the 22 and 43ghz receivers .",
    "the equivalent noise temperatures of both amplifiers are approximately 15k over the whole observing frequency bands .",
    "the receiver noise temperatures for three 22ghz receivers are measured to be 30 - 40k . for the 43ghz receivers , the receiver noise temperatures are 40 - 50k for one receiver and 70 - 80k for the other two receivers .",
    "the increase of the receiver noise temperatures is resulted from the aggregated loss by feed horn , vacuum window , thermal isolator , and polarizer . the 43ghz receiver with lower noise temperature",
    "is thermally isolated by a thermal isolator adopted at vla , whereas the others by photonic bandgap isolators between dewar and polarizer .",
    "the spread of the receiver noise temperatures among 43ghz receivers may be due to the difference of the thermal isolators .",
    "the signals are first amplified in a cooled stage and then further amplified by a room - temperature amplifier .",
    "they are then down - converted to 8 - 10ghz , @xmath30 if ( intermediate frequency ) in the mixers using pdros ( phase - locked dielectric resonator oscillator ) which are locked on the 100mhz reference signal transmitted from the h - maser .",
    "the observing frequency bandwidth is limited within 2ghz by bpf ( band pass filter ) in @xmath30 if .",
    "two @xmath30 if signals are selected using spdt switches .",
    "the selected signals may consist of single polarization signals at dual frequency bands or dual polarization signals at single frequency band .",
    "the signal conditioning and @xmath31 frequency conversion are done in the base band converter by using irm ( image rejection mixer ) with an image rejection ratio of 18db , a 8.7 - 10.8ghz frequency synthesizer with a step frequency of 100hz , and a digital step attenuator which offers an attenuation range up to 31.5db in steps of 0.5db .",
    "the final analog output signals are limited to 512 - 1024mhz by an anti - aliasing filter .",
    "the output signal from the base band converter is split into two different paths .",
    "one goes to a digital sampler and the other to a square - law detector ( or tpd ) .",
    "the output from the detector is amplified and input into a voltage - to - frequency converter ( hereafter vfc ) .",
    "an embedded counter of the vfc counts the output pulse rates , which are propotional to the output power of the base band converter .",
    "the counted output pulse rates are taken every 100 millisecond by a receiver - control computer in the receiver cabin .",
    "the vfc data are used not only for calibrating the receiver gain and the sky attenuation level but also for measuring the total flux of celestial objects in continuum observation mode . an observing technique , cross scan , is used for the total flux measurements of point - like objects in continuum single dish observations at kvn .",
    "since the technique relies on scanning with the main beam over the source position in both azimuth and elevation directions , the receiver gain and atmosphere fluctuations faster than a few seconds could not be tracked and removed .",
    "the calibration against the faster fluctuations will be improved by using a noise diode with known temperature and a faster data aquisition system .",
    "the signals digitized by the samplers in the receiver room are processed by the kvn data acqusition system ( das ) to get spectra for single - dish spectroscopy observations . in vlbi operation , the digitized signals processed in the das are recorded onto storage media such as harddisks or magnetic tapes .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : das ] , the das consists of four subsystems ; samplers , optical trasmission system ( ots ) , digital filter bank ( dfb ) and digital spectrometer ( dsm ) , which were manufactured by a japanese company , elecs industry co. ltd .",
    "the samplers digitize base band signals into 2-bit data streams with four quantization levels .",
    "the output data streams of the samplers are transmitted to the observing building through optical fibers by the ots .",
    "the das is configurable to various modes according to the required number of streams and bandwidths . for wideband observations ,",
    "the dsm uses the output streams of the ots , while for narrow band observations it uses the output stream of the dfb . in principle",
    ", the dfb produces 16 data streams of 16mhz bandwith from 4 streams of 512mhz bandwidth . combining more than one stream",
    ", the dfb can produce streams with wider bandwidth such as 8@xmath3232mhz , 4@xmath3264mhz , 2@xmath32128mhz and 1@xmath32256mhz .",
    "the dsm is a fx - type digital correlator and we use the auto - correlation output for spectroscopy observations .",
    "table  [ table : obsmode ] summarizes the available spectrometer outputs of the dsm .",
    "the correlation output produced by the dsm has 8192 channels but control computer can take only half of them .",
    "so we take full bandwidth after smoothing and binning pairs of adjacent channels , or half bandwidth by selecting 4096 contiguous channels .",
    "for example in the wide mode , we can get 4@xmath32512mhz bandwidth spectra or 4@xmath32256mhz bandwidth spectra .",
    "detailed information for the kvn das is described in @xcite .",
    "the dsm can calculate the cross - correlation of two input data streams and thus can be used for polarimetry .",
    "the polarimetry observation mode using kvn single - dish is currently being test , and will be described in a separate paper .      for single - dish operation using a kvn antenna , we support various observation modes such as sky dipping ( sdip ) , position switching ( ps ) , frequency switching ( fs ) , focusing ( focus ) , five - point mapping ( five ) , grid mapping ( grid ) , cross scan ( cs ) and on - the - fly mapping ( otf ) .",
    "the observed data from all observing modes except for the continuum otf mapping are stored into a gildas class file . the continuum otf data written in ascii format are reduced and converted into fits format .",
    "the observation control software was written in python progmaming language and runs on ipython interpreter .",
    "a sequence of observations for many sources can be easily run by writing a simple python script .",
    "the observation software runs on a pc running linux . at most 8 streams of data can be simultaneously processed with a data - taking cycle of 100 milliseconds .",
    "a graphical user interface ( gui ) is used for configuring devices and running observations .",
    "on 10th october , 2008 , we had first light with the kvn yonsei radio telescope simultaneously observing @xmath19 and sio masers in orion kl at 22 and 43ghz .",
    "the resultant spectra at both frequency bands indicate that the overall receiving system of kvn yonsei radio telescope is functioning properly . in this section , we describe the results of single dish performance tests for kvn radio telescopes .",
    "it is very important to align the beams of different bands with other as accurately as possible .",
    "poor beam alignment will result in the large uncertainty of flux measurements for simultaneous multi - frequency obsevations .",
    "therefore the beam alignment has to be measured and corrected to satisfy the requirement that two ( or four ) beams should be aligned within @xmath33 of the fwhm of the smallest beam ( e.g. , 7 arcseconds for 22 and 43ghz , and 2.5 arcseconds for 22 , 43 , 86 , and 129ghz ) .    as a first step of the beam alignment measurements , we observed some bright and compact radio sources at 22 and 43ghz including planets and sio maser sources for measuring the beam alignment after the setup of the quasioptics .",
    "the beam alignments were estimated by measuring the pointing offsets at each frequency with cs and five observing modes .",
    "if the measured beam alignments were larger than the requirement , we have investigated the reasons for the poor alignment .",
    "for all cases , the poor beam alignments were caused by the misalignment of the quasioptical system including feed horns , and could be corrected by changing the angle of flat mirrors and feed horns in the quasioptical system .",
    "table  [ tab - bl ] shows that the results of beam alignments with respect to the beam at 43ghz for three kvn telescopes after corretions .",
    "the beams of all kvn antennas were very well aligned in azimuth and there was no need for correction .",
    "however , beam offsets in elevation were measured to be as large as 7 arcseconds . after changing the angle of flat mirrors in the quasioptical system , we measured the beam offsets to be @xmath0 arcseconds .",
    "the elevation and azimuth dependence of the beam alignments also have been investigated by observing planets and sio masers at various elevations .",
    "we found no significant elevation dependence of the beam alignments for all kvn antennas .",
    "this implies that the quasioptical systems and the receiver plates including the sub - plate for the 22ghz receivers are stable against gravitational deformation .      since the beams at 22 and",
    "43ghz are well aligned each other , it is efficient to establish the pointing model only at 43ghz using sio maser sources ( mostly late type stars ) whose positions are very well known .",
    "as long as the alignment between two antenna beams is accurate to @xmath33 of the fwhm at 43ghz , the pointing model derived from sio maser observations at 43ghz should ensure the pointing accuracies for both frequency bands .",
    "a pointing model had already been obtained by observing strong sio maser sources with a 100ghz receiving system .",
    "these observations had been done to evaluate the performance of the antenna under the contract with the antenna manufacturer  ( see * ? ? ? * ) . on the basis of this pointing model established at 100ghz ,",
    "a sample of 9 late type stars ( table  [ tab - poi1 ] ) have been used continuously to improve the pointing accuracy of the telescope .",
    "table  [ tab - poi2 ] describes the accuracies of pointing models established for three kvn radio telescopes during the evaluation period 2009 - 2011 .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) of the residual pointing offsets between the observations and the pointing models are listed in azimuth ( @xmath34 ) , elevation ( @xmath35 ) , and total ( @xmath36 ) , respectively , for each epoch and telescope ( see figure  [ fig : res ] for an example of residual pointing offsets ) . before applying a cladding system ( see below for detail ) , the residual rms errors are @xmath37 arcsecond in azimuth and @xmath38 arcsecond in elevation .",
    "the pointing accuracies have been improved to be @xmath37 arcsecond in both azimuth and elevation after applying the cladding system for more efficiently insulating the antenna mount structure .",
    "thermal deflection of the antenna mounting structures ( yoke arms ) have been investigated in order to imporve the antenna pointing accuracy .",
    "when the antenna mounting structures face directly to the sun , thermal deflection causes the antenna pointing offsets to rapidly change from a few to @xmath1840 arcseconds within an hour .",
    "the large pointing offsets result in a large uncertainty of flux measurements not only for single dish observations but also for vlbi ( phase referencing ) observations during day time .",
    "therefore , we decided to apply a cladding system to the antenna mounting structures ( figure  [ fig : clad ] ) . new cladding system provides an efficient thermal insulation by making an air gap with its thickness of 80 mm between new and old cladding systems .",
    "new cladding systems were installed on 14 october 2010 , 6 november 2010 , and 24 november 2010 for kvnys , kvnus , and kvntn , respectively . after applying the cladding , the pointing offsets due to thermal effects",
    "have been reduced to be less than 20 arcseconds and the time scale of the thermal effects improved to be @xmath39 5 hours . as a result",
    ", the rms residuals in the pointing model have been improved by a factor of @xmath40 ( table  [ tab - poi2 ] ) . in case of observations during day time , especially at sunrise , the pointing observations must be conducted out at least every hour for maintaining the pointing accuracy to be less than 4 acrseconds .",
    "surface accuracies of the main reflectors of the kvn radio telescopes had been measured by photogrammetry at an elevation of @xmath41 , yielding alignment surface accuracies of 50 , 54 , and 51@xmath42 for the kvn yonsei , ulsan , and tamna telescopes , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the expected total surface accuracy of kvn antennas is @xmath43 m ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) which is good to enable observations at frequencies of @xmath44 .",
    "the surface accuracies have been verified by the 100ghz test observations yielding aperture efficiencies of 52% and main - beam efficiencies of 46% for all three telescopes  @xcite .    since",
    "new recievers and quasioptical systems at 22 and 43ghz have been installed for kvn radio telescopes , the corresponding antenna efficiencies should be measured in order to evaluate the alignment of the quasioptical systems including feed horns .",
    "the antenna efficiencies can be measured by observing primary calibrators such as planets . since a planet can be considered as disk with uniform brightness , the measured antenna temperature , @xmath45 , is related to the aperture ( @xmath46 ) and beam ( @xmath47 ) efficiencies as  @xcite : @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50,\\ ] ] @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 are the effective and physical areas of main reflector , the observing wavelength , the brightness temperature , the source solid angle , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 are the main beam solid angle , the antenna solid angle , the angular size of the source , and the size of main beam ( fwhm ) , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab - eff ] lists measurements of main beam size , @xmath60 , apperture efficiency , @xmath46 , and main beam efficiency , @xmath47 at 22 and 43ghz over the period 2009 april2011 march .",
    "the measured aperture efficiencies are @xmath1(k)/@xmath2(q ) , @xmath3(k)/@xmath4(q ) , and @xmath5(k)/@xmath6(q ) for kvnys , kvnus , and kvntn , respectively .",
    "the measurement errors of the aperture efficiencies are less than 2% .",
    "main beam sizes were estimated from the cs or otf observations of venus or jupiter as well as from the five observations of strong @xmath19 and sio maser sources . for each measurement of the apperture efficiency , jupiter or venus",
    "have been observed in cs or otf mapping mode over various elevations when the angular sizes of the planets were smaller than the main beam size at 43ghz .",
    "measurements at elevations of @xmath61 were averaged to estimate the main beam size and the apperture efficiency with their standard deviations listed in table  [ tab - eff ] .",
    "the main beam efficiency was calculated through its relation to the apperture efficiency ( eq.[[eqn : eff2 ] ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties of the brightness temperatures of venus ( @xmath62k at k - band  @xcite and @xmath63k at q - band  @xcite ) and jupiter ( @xmath64k at k - band  @xcite and @xmath65k at q - band  @xcite ) dominate the error of the aperture efficiency .",
    "the predicted aperture efficiencies from the original design of the antenna with a blockage efficiency of 88% are 72% at k band and 75% at q band .",
    "the measured aperture efficiencies are lower than these by @xmath6610% and @xmath6616% at each band .",
    "this is , in fact , expected from the results of the 100ghz test observations of the kvn radio telescopes  @xcite .",
    "the 100ghz aperture efficienies are 52% for the three antennas , which are lower than the designed value of 60% , due to a slightly lower blockage efficiency from the additional cladding of the subreflector supports .",
    "the aperture efficiencies at 100ghz are similar for all antennas , whereas those at k and q bands are different from each antenna . at k band , the aperture efficiency of kvnus is lower than those of the others , and at q band , kvnus and kvntn have lower aperture efficincies than kvnys",
    ". this may be because of larger misalignment of quasioptical system at kvnus and kvntn than that at kvnys .",
    "the aperture efficiency is degraded if the quasioptical system is not well aligned with the antenna , although the relative beam alignment between two frequency bands is good .",
    "the alignment will be improved when new receivers at 86 and 129ghz and corresponding quasioptical systems are installed .",
    "the measured main beam sizes are @xmath67(k)/@xmath68(q ) , @xmath69(k)/@xmath70(q ) , and @xmath71(k)/@xmath68(q ) for kvnys , kvnus , and kvntn , respectively over the period 2009 april2011 march ( table  [ tab - eff ] ) .",
    "the main beam sizes have no dependence on elevation and a small difference of @xmath214% between azimuth and elevation directions .",
    "these main beam sizes are smaller by @xmath72 than the diffraction limit of @xmath73 at 22.235ghz and @xmath74 at 43.122ghz for uniform aperture illumination .",
    "this may result from blockage effect  @xcite and/or inverse - tapered illumination of the main reflector .",
    "these effects also result in relatively higher sidelobe levels than for the conventional cassegrain antenna .",
    "the antenna beam patterns for all kvn antennas were measured and the beam pattern for kvntn is shown in figure  [ fig : beam ] . the first sidelobe levels are -13.0/-13.0db ( k / q ) , -13.0/-12.7db ( k / q ) , and -13.1/-12.7db ( k / q ) for kvnys , kvnus , and kvntn , respectively .",
    "the measured sidelobe levels are significantly higher than those ( -17.6db ) for the cassegrain antennas with uniform illumination pattern and without blockage  @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that , due to the higher sidelobe level , spectral line observation data should be carefully analyzed , taking into account possible coupling to the first sidelobe .",
    "the main - beam efficiencies are measured to be @xmath7(k)/@xmath8(q ) , @xmath9(k)/@xmath7(q ) , and @xmath7(k)/@xmath10(q ) for kvnys , kvnus , and kvntn , respectively . since the main - beam efficiency was estimated according to its relation to the apperture efficiency ( eq.[[eqn : eff2 ] ] ) , the statistical errors are not estimated .",
    "however the estimation of the main - beam efficiencies are also affected by the uncertainty of the brightness temperatures of venus and jupiter and the measurement errors of main - beam sizes . due to the high level sidelobes , the main - beam efficiencies are lower with respect to the aperture efficiencies than in case of conventional cassegrain telescopes .",
    "we measured moon efficiencies , @xmath75 , of the kvn radio telescopes by otf - mapping the moon at 22 and 43ghz .",
    "the moon efficiencies were derived based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the estimated moon efficiencies are @xmath11(k)/@xmath12(q ) , @xmath13(k)/@xmath14(q ) , and @xmath15(k)/@xmath16(q ) for kvnys , kvnus , and kvntn , respectively ( table  [ tab - meff ] ) .",
    "the error of the moon efficiency is dominated by the measurement error of antenna temperature of moon which is as large as 1 - 2% .",
    "gain curve measurements were made in september , 2009 for kvn yonsei , in march , 2011 for kvn ulsan , and in december , 2010 for kvn tamna .",
    "the elevation dependence of the aperture efficiency of the kvn 21-m radio telescopes was measured by observing bright @xmath19 and sio maser sources at 22 and 43ghz in dual polarizations ( lcp and rcp ) using the five pointing observations .",
    "every 10 five pointing observations , the atmospheric opacity was measured and the subreflector focus was adjusted based on the pre - established model for the subreflector . in order to avoid gain degradation due to the thermal deformation of antenna , the gain curve measurements were performed at night .",
    "the pointing offsets were corrected during the data reduction based on the results of the five pointing observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : gc ] shows the normalized specral line intensities of @xmath19 and sio maser sources in elevations of @xmath76 for kvn yonsei , ulsan , and tamna at 22 and 43ghz .",
    "a second order polynomial was least - square - fitted to the data .",
    "the fitted function was normalized by its maximum .",
    "normalized gain curve has the following form : @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the elevation in degree .",
    "the fitted parameters are summarized in table  [ tab - gc ] .",
    "the gain curves at 22ghz are quite flat at the elevatations of @xmath79 . at 43ghz , the antenna gains at low elevation decrease by less than 10% .",
    "extensive simultaneous h@xmath80o @xmath81 ( 22.23508  ghz ) and ch@xmath82oh @xmath83 ( 44.06943  ghz ) maser line surveys were carried out towards galactic young stellar objects ( ysos ) using the kvn 21-m telescopes .",
    "because of variability of the two masers , simultaneous observations are important for comparison of their properties in detail .",
    "@xcite report the observational results on 180 intermediate - mass ysos , including 14 class  0 objects , 19 class  i objects , and 147 herbig ae / be stars that are widely believed to be intermediate - mass stars in the pre - main sequence phase .",
    "@xmath19  and @xmath84  maser emission were detected towards 16 ( 9% ) and 10 ( 6% ) sources , respectively .",
    "the detection rates of both masers rapidly decrease as the central ( proto)stars evolve , which is consistent with the tend for h@xmath80o masers observed in low - mass star - forming regions  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the excitation of the two masers is related to the evolutionary stage of the central object .",
    "masers usually have significantly larger relative velocities with respective to the ambient molecular gas than do @xmath84  masers .",
    "the isotropic luminosities of both masers are well correlated with the bolometric luminosities of the central ( proto)stars .",
    "the same maser line surveys were performed towards more than 1000 high - mass ysos in different evolutionary phases : infrared dark cores , high - mass protostellar candidates , and ultracompact hii regions ( kim et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the detection rates of both masers significantly increase as the central objects evolve .",
    "this is contrary to the trends found in low- and intermediate - mass star - forming regions , as mentioned above .",
    "thus the excitation of the two masers appear to be closely related to the circumstellar environments as well as the evolutionary stage of the central ( proto)stars .",
    "studies of late - type stars using the kvn yonsei radio telescope were performed toward known stellar sio and/or @xmath19 maser sources ( 166 both sio and @xmath19 maser sources , 83 sio - only sources , and 152 @xmath19-only sources ) soon after finishing the performance test observations .",
    "both sio and @xmath19 masers were detected from 112 sources at one epoch giving a detection rate of 67% toward 166 both sio and @xmath19 maser sources  @xcite , detected from 14 sources ( detection rate of 17% ) toward 83 sio - only sources ( cho et al .",
    "2011 in prep . ) , and detected from 62 sources ( detection rate of 41% ) toward 152 @xmath19-only sources ( kim et al .",
    "2011 in prep . ) , respectively .",
    "some spectra simultaneously obtained in the @xmath19 @xmath81 and sio @xmath85 and 2 , @xmath86 transitions are shown in figure  [ fig : ls ] . through simultaneous observations of sio and @xmath19 masers ,",
    "relations between sio and @xmath19 maser properties and the dynamical connection from the pulsating atmosphere to the inner circumstellar envelope were investigated toward evolved stars .",
    "the distribution of single and double peaked profiles of @xmath19 maser lines were also examined in the iras two - color diagram .",
    "these single and double peaked @xmath19 maser lines can be associated with an asymmetric wind and bipolar outflows which are commonly seen in proto - planetary nebulae and planetary nebulae as suggested by @xcite .",
    "total flux monitoring of the intraday variable source 0716 + 714 were made simultaneously at 21.7ghz and 42.4ghz with kvn yonsei 21-m radio telescope on december 11 - 15 , 2009 and january 4 - 11 , 2010 .",
    "an absolute calibrator , 3c 286 , was observed for flux calibration , and a nearby secondary calibrator , 0836 + 714 , observed for gain calibration .",
    "all flux measurements were done with cs ( cross scan ) mode .",
    "the total bandwidth was 500mhz at both frequency bands .",
    "figure  [ fig:0716 ] shows the light curves and specral indicies of 0716 + 714 for two epochs . in these observations , intraday variability of 0716 + 714",
    "is not seen , but a monotonic increase and decrease of total flux density on longer time scale were observed .",
    "more interestingly , as the source gets brighter the spectral index becomes flatter , and vice - versa .",
    "through the performance evaluation observations in 2008 - 2011 , we found that the kvn 21-m radio telescopes are suitable for simultaneous multi - frequency single polarization observations at 22 and 43ghz .",
    "the dual beams at two frequencies are well aligned within @xmath0 arcseconds .",
    "the pointing accuracies are @xmath213 arcseconds in azimuth and elevation .",
    "the measured aperture efficiencies are of @xmath87 at 22ghz and @xmath88 at 43ghz , the main - beam efficiencies are @xmath89 at 22ghz and @xmath90 at 43ghz , and the estimated moon efficiencies are @xmath91 at 22ghz and @xmath92 at 43ghz .",
    "the elevation dependence of the aperture efficiencies is quite flat at the elevations of @xmath17 unique receiving systems , accurate beam alignment , and high antenna efficiencies will provide us with good opportunities for scientific observations at millimeter wavelengths not only for single radio telescope but also for very long baseline interferometry .",
    "this work was supported by basic research program ( 2008 - 2011 ) and also partially supported by kasi - yonsei joint research program ( 2010 - 2011 ) for the frontiers of astronomy and space science funded by the korea astronomy and space science institute .",
