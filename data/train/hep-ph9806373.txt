    "for @xmath12 decay , the four on - shell helicity amplitudes @xmath13 can be uniquely determined by measurement of four moduli and three relative phases . in fig .",
    "1 , measurements in the right and left columns are respectively of order @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the interference measurements between the two columns are of order @xmath16 . @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the @xmath19 quark s helicity @xmath20 .",
    "the values of @xmath13 for the standard model(sm ) are given in the top row of table 1 .",
    "for the pure @xmath21 coupling of the standard model , the left - handed helicity @xmath22 amplitudes dominate by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude for @xmath23 .",
    "intrinsic and relative signs of these helicity amplitudes are determined by the jacob - wick phase convention .",
    "the layout of the corners in fig .",
    "1 has been chosen to reflect the layout in the following probability plots for @xmath24 versus @xmath25 where @xmath26    the focus of this paper is on direct measurements of these @xmath7 amplitudes by forthcoming experiments at the fermilab tevatron[1 ] and at the cern lhc[2 ] relative to the anticipated pure @xmath21 predictions . if , for instance , sizable @xmath27 amplitudes were found to occur by these experiments , further analysis of coupling and phase - type ambiguities may be warranted .",
    "likewise , when more precise measurements become possible in later experiments at the lhc or near the @xmath28 threshold at a linear @xmath29 collider , higher order qcd and ew corrections must be included , see [ 3 ] .",
    "plots and tables of the values of the helicity parameters are given in terms of a `` @xmath30 + additional lorentz structure '' .",
    "generically , we denote these additional couplings by @xmath31 @xmath32 for 1em @xmath33 , the most general lorentz coupling[4 ] is @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 @xmath37 some of the issues concerning the choice of a minimal subset of such couplings are discussed in ref . [ 4 ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 `` the effective - mass scale of new physics '' . for @xmath39 units with @xmath40 ,",
    "the nominal size of @xmath41 is @xmath42 , see below .",
    "lorentz equivalence theorems for these couplings are treated in appendix b. explicit expressions for the @xmath13 in the case of these additional lorentz structures are given in ref . [ 4 ] .",
    "improved theoretical treatments of effects of the @xmath43 quark mass @xmath44 might also be important because of the small size of the @xmath27 amplitudes in the sm .",
    "in particular , as is discussed below , in many cases if an additional lorentz structure occurs , finite @xmath45 effects lead to sizable `` oval shapes '' as the effective mass scale @xmath46 varies .",
    "other recent general analyses of effects in @xmath12 decay associated with new physics arising from large effective - mass scales @xmath46 are in refs . [ 5 - 8 ] .",
    "the `` arrows '' in the upper part of fig . 1",
    "define the measurable @xmath47 relative phases between the four amplitudes .",
    "for instance , @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "so for a pure @xmath21 coupling , the @xmath50 s vanish and all the @xmath51 s and @xmath52 s equal @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) to give the intrinsic minus sign of the standard model s @xmath27 amplitudes .    the lower part of fig",
    ". 1 displays the real part and imaginary part ( primed ) helicity parameters corresponding to interference measurements of the respective relative phases .",
    "for instance , c.f .",
    "appendix c , @xmath55 and @xmath56 explicit expressions for the eight @xmath57-polarimetry moduli and phase parameters @xmath58 are given in ref .",
    "[ 4 ] , along with the inverse formulas for @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "by @xmath61 polarimetry[4 ] , or some other @xmath43-polarimetry technique , it might be possible to measure the @xmath51 and @xmath52 relative phase . in the standard model ,",
    "the two helicity parameters between the amplitudes with the largest moduli are @xmath62 we will refer to @xmath63 as the `` @xmath43-polarimetry phase parameters '' . from figs",
    ". 1 other combinations of relative phases / helicity - parameters are mathematically equivalent",
    ".    unfortunately from the perspective of a complete measurement of the four helicity amplitudes , the tree - level values of @xmath64 in the sm are only about @xmath65 .",
    "see the top line in both parts of table 2 , which lists the @xmath21 values of the helicity parameters for @xmath66 . in the absence of @xmath67 violation[4 ] , the relative phases will be interger multiples of @xmath68 and all prime parameters will vanish .",
    "the prime parameters are not directly discussed in this paper .    in fig .",
    "2 are two probability plots for @xmath69 versus @xmath70 .",
    "the upper plot is for the case of a single additional chiral coupling @xmath71 .",
    "the corners correspond to those of fig .",
    "so the dark rectangle of the sm , gives the relative magnitude of the square of the moduli of its four basic helicity amplitudes . also , note from the dashed horizontal oval that an additional @xmath72 coupling does not change the sm expectation that approximately @xmath73 of the final @xmath57 s in @xmath12 decay will be longitudinally polarized .",
    "the endpoints of each oval are at the dark sm rectangle and the dark ellipse where the coupling is pure @xmath74 in general , the non - zero area of an oval depends monotonically on @xmath66 and the area will increase if a larger value is chosen for @xmath75 the captions to the figures in this paper discuss the signs of effective - mass scales @xmath46 associated with the two parts of each oval which lie between the two endpoints . appendix a gives numerical values of the @xmath46 corresponding to various values of the helicity parameters .    the lower plot in fig .",
    "2 is for the case of a single additional non - chiral coupling @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the corresponding ovals in the two non - chiral plots are almost identical in shape .",
    "the @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) endpoints lie on the upper(lower ) parts of their ovals .    in this paper , we omit the @xmath77 curves corresponding to the ones provided for @xmath76 because by lorentz invariance the corresponding ovals , etc . , are almost identical .",
    "the slight shape differences are very minor to the eye and are definitely negligible versus the resolutions of the forthcoming experiments and the omitted higher order theoretical contributions .",
    "the necessary mirror reflections , in a few cases , to produce the omitted curves are explained in the captions to the figures .",
    "versus predictions based on the sm , two phase - type ambiguities arise by consideration of the effects of a single additional `` chiral '' coupling @xmath71 on the three moduli parameters @xmath80and @xmath81 .",
    "the partial width @xmath82 for @xmath12 is the remaining and very important moduli parameter .",
    "however , since @xmath82 sets the overall scale , it can not be well measured by spin - correlation techniques , which better measure the ratios of moduli and relative phases .",
    "so , we consider @xmath82 separately ; see also [ 9 ] and references therein .    for an additional @xmath83 coupling with @xmath84 the values of @xmath85 and also of the partial width @xmath82 are about the same as the sm prediction , see table 2 .",
    "this is the first ambiguity .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath86 / @xmath24 value versus the effective - mass scale @xmath87 is shown in the upper plot in fig .",
    "table 1 shows that this ambiguity will also occur if the sign of the @xmath88 amplitude for @xmath89 is taken to be opposite to that of the sm s amplitude .",
    "recall that an additional @xmath90 only effects the longitudinal @xmath91 amplitudes and not the transverse @xmath92 ones . by requiring that @xmath93 for @xmath94",
    ", we obtain@xmath95 in the notation of [ 4 ] .    several different definitions can be used to characterize the phase - type ambiguities we consider in this section .",
    "it is important , we think , to regard these ambiguities from ( i ) the signs in their @xmath7 amplitudes versus those for the sm , c.f .",
    "table 1 , and from ( ii ) their associated additional lorentz structures . from this perspective , the precise characterization of @xmath96 , as in ( 8,9 ) for example , is not so important .",
    "however , if a non - sm sign were discovered to occur in nature , further analysis and precise measurements would be warranted .    for an additional @xmath97 coupling with @xmath98",
    "the values of @xmath85 are also about the same as the sm prediction , see table 2 .",
    "this is the second ambiguity . in this case",
    ", the partial width @xmath82 is about half that of the sm due to destructive interference .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath99 / @xmath24 value versus the effective - mass scale @xmath100 is shown in the lower plot of fig .",
    "table 1 shows that this ambiguity will also occur if the sign of the @xmath101 amplitude for @xmath89 is taken to be opposite to that of the sm s amplitude .",
    "again , from ( 8) for @xmath102 , we obtain@xmath103 from eqs.(31 ) in [ 4 ] since @xmath104 .",
    "these phase - type ambiguities are , of course , not the same dynamical issue as finding a combination of @xmath105 and @xmath106 couplings which give the identical @xmath7 amplitudes as for a pure @xmath21 coupling . by the expressions in appendix b , this is possible if @xmath107 and a negligible @xmath108 .",
    "alternatively , the fundamental @xmath109 coupling is removed by @xmath110 and the @xmath111 coupling by @xmath112 .    besides the @xmath97 construction of this second phase - type ambiguity , it should be kept in mind that some other mechanism might produce the relative sign change shown in table 1 , but without also changing the absolute value of the @xmath7 amplitudes . in this case",
    "the measurement of the partial width @xmath113 would not resolve the phase ambiguity .    from consideration of table 1 , a third ( phase )",
    "ambiguity can be constructed by making an arbitrary sign - flip in the @xmath7 amplitudes , so @xmath114 , with no corresponding sign changes in the @xmath27 amplitudes .",
    "resolution of this ambiguity will require @xmath43-polarimetry , c.f .",
    "[ 4 ] , or some other amplitude interference measurement of the overall sign of the @xmath7 amplitudes relative to the @xmath27 amplitudes .    in figs . 4",
    "are plotted the moduli parameters @xmath115 versus @xmath99 for the case of a single additional coupling @xmath71 .",
    "the figures are for the case of an additional chiral ( non - chiral ) coupling .    from the perspective of possible additional lorentz structures , measurement of the partial width",
    "@xmath82 is an important constraint . in particular",
    ", this provides a strong constraint on possible @xmath72 couplings , see top part of fig .",
    "5 , in contrast to measurement of @xmath99 / @xmath24 which does not , recall fig .",
    "2 . the remaining parts of fig",
    ". 5 are for @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) . likewise , as shown in the top part of figs .",
    "6 , @xmath82 provides a useful constraint for the possibility of additional @xmath109 and @xmath111 couplings which are appealing from the perspective of additional gauge - theoretic structures . here also , the lower part of this figure is for an additional @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) coupling .",
    "in figs . 7 are plotted the @xmath120 versus @xmath121 for the case of a single additional coupling @xmath71 .",
    "the figures are for the case of an additional chiral ( non - chiral ) coupling . quite dramatically in the upper plot , the @xmath83 and @xmath105 ambiguities both correspond to a  pseudo - image of the sm rectangle \" .",
    "this image is in the third quadrant on the diagonal at @xmath122 .",
    "as shown in the bottom part of table 2 , measurement of the signs of either of the @xmath57-polarimetry phase parameters @xmath120 or @xmath121 will resolve both the @xmath83 and the @xmath97 phase - type ambiguities . in the sm , these parameters are sizable and are equal if the @xmath27 amplitudes are omitted , see eqs.(5,6 ) .    as discussed above , determination of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 relative phases , as well as resolution of the third ambiguity , will require direct empirical information about the @xmath27 amplitudes .",
    "one way would be from the @xmath43-polarimetry phase parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 . in figs .",
    "8 are plotted @xmath123 versus @xmath125 for the case of a single additional coupling @xmath71 .",
    "the figures are for the case of an additional non - chiral ( chiral ) coupling . here in general",
    ", the non - chiral couplings produce larger values for @xmath126 and @xmath127 and so we display the non - chiral case first .",
    "in particular , additional @xmath83 and @xmath105 couplings have negligible effects on @xmath123 and @xmath124 , see captions .",
    "not shown in these figures for @xmath128 and @xmath129 is the unitarity limit , which is a circle of radius @xmath130 centered on the origin .    in figs .",
    "9 are plotted @xmath124 versus @xmath131 for the case of a single additional coupling @xmath71 .",
    "the figures are for the case of an additional non - chiral ( chiral ) coupling .",
    "from the plots for the various helicity parameters , it is evident that there also are ambiguities within certain subsets of the couplings if an additional lorentz structure were to occur in the form of a single additional @xmath71 .",
    "the occurrence of an additional lorentz structure would also raise the issue of how the sign of its @xmath46 could be determined .",
    "the following equivalence classes among additional lorentz structures ( versus subsets of possible experimental tests ) is another consequence of the underlying lorentz invariance of ( 2,3 ) , etc .",
    "second , with only @xmath57-polarimetry , the effects of the non - zero @xmath45 mass ( @xmath132 ) are negligible for ( i ) additional gauge couplings @xmath133 and for ( ii ) additional chiral couplings .",
    "however , there is a sizable @xmath45 dependence in some chiral couplings in the @xmath128 and @xmath129 plots . in general for additional @xmath134 couplings ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath45 is sizable and is likely to be a serious systematic effect , for instance in excluding possible effects from from fundamental or induced couplings with these lorentz structures .      from the gauge theory viewpoint , it is important to search for additional vector and axial vector couplings .",
    "the sm s @xmath24 and @xmath136 values are only slightly affected by them .",
    "but the values for @xmath137 ( equivalently @xmath25 ) , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath124 are significantly different from those of the sm .",
    "however , inspection of the figures shows that in many of the plots the ovals for @xmath141 are approximately degenerate .",
    "nevertheless , from the different locations of their endpoints in figs.(8 - 9 ) , the @xmath142 parameters could be useful in resolving them .",
    "so @xmath43-polarimetry or @xmath82 would generally be useful to resolve these additional couplings and to determine the sign of the associated @xmath46 .      for @xmath145 versus @xmath146 there are differences in some of the plots but sufficient resolution and control of possible @xmath45 effects would be needed . in particular , the narrow @xmath146 oval and the degenerate fat @xmath147 ovals lie approximately in the same @xmath148 regions and also in the same @xmath149 regions .",
    "the sign of @xmath46 is the same for the @xmath150 and @xmath144 ovals .",
    "if @xmath151 , it would exclude @xmath146 and would determine the respective sign of @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath152 plot is useful for distinguishing @xmath150 versus @xmath144 and for the sign of @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath146 were resolved , then @xmath126 would give the sign of @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath82 is not useful for separating @xmath150 versus @xmath144 , but @xmath82 is different for @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath97 and @xmath83 can be distinguished from either the @xmath148 or @xmath153 plots .",
    "once separated , @xmath82 could provide information on the sign of @xmath46 . if @xmath151 , it would determine the respective sign of @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath154 for these couplings .      with sufficient resolution and control of @xmath45 effects ,",
    "@xmath155 could be separated versus @xmath156 , @xmath157 by @xmath148 ; by the @xmath153 plot ; and/or by @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath158,@xmath159 plot would be useful for separating @xmath156 from @xmath157 and in determining the sign of @xmath160 it would also determine the sign for @xmath155 .",
