    "modelling the chemical evolution of the gas during the process of star formation on various scales is a numerically and theoretically challenging task .",
    "several authors have incorporated reduced chemical networks in their 3d , magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the newly designed chemistry package krome @xcite is a versatile package which allows the user to incorporate chemistry in mhd simulations in a very efficient manner and simultaneously guarantees the freedom to choose _ any _ desired network as well as its associated cooling and heating processes .",
    "furthermore , recently the importance of filamentary structures in star forming clouds has been re - emphasized ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which make them an optimal target to test the feasibility of using a detailed chemical network in fully self - consistent 3d - mhd simulations .",
    "the simulations presented here use the same initial conditions as those presented in @xcite .",
    "the simulated filaments have an initial width of about 0.1 pc , a length of 1.6 pc , and a mass per unit length of 75 m@xmath0/pc .",
    "the initial magnetic field strength is 40 @xmath1 g , in agreement with recent observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the field is oriented either perpendicular or parallel to the filament .",
    "we perform several simulations with varying strengths of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and the cosmic ray ionisation rate ( crir ) .    in order to model the chemical evolution of the gas",
    ", we use the krome package @xcite .",
    "the network used contains 37 species and 287 reactions and is designed to model the formation of co and h@xmath2 in great detail ( also including the formation of h@xmath2 on dust ) .",
    "we calculate the attenuation of the isrf as well as the self - shielding factors for h@xmath2 and co formation in the flash code with the treecol algorithm @xcite .",
    "we take into account all relevant cooling and heating mechanism present in the interstellar medium , which also includes the cooling via line emission of co and is isotopologues @xmath3co and c@xmath4o as well as a detailed calculation of the dust temperature , @xmath5 .",
    "a more detailed description of the chemistry network can be found in @xcite .",
    "in the following , we present the time evolution of the run with a parallel magnetic field , g@xmath6 = 1.7 , and a crir of 1.3 @xmath7 10@xmath8 s@xmath9 . in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : species ] we plot the spatial distribution of h , h@xmath2 , c , and co at the end of the simulation , which reveals some differences in the radial distribution .",
    "whereas h@xmath2 and co are concentrated towards the centre of the filament , h and c are more extended .    ,",

    "right : from left to right : radial dependence of the density of h@xmath2 , h , h@xmath10 , and co , c , and c@xmath10 at after the start of this simulation . the black line in the upper left panel shows the total hydrogen density divided by two.,title=\"fig : \" ] , c , and co at the end of the simulation with a parallel magnetic field , g@xmath6 = 1.7 , and a crir of 1.3 @xmath7 10@xmath8 s@xmath9 along a slice through the centre of the filament .",
    "right : from left to right : radial dependence of the density of h@xmath2 , h , h@xmath10 , and co , c , and c@xmath10 at after the start of this simulation . the black line in the upper left panel shows the total hydrogen density divided by two.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the radial density profiles of h@xmath2 , h , h@xmath10 , co , c , and c@xmath10 at 4 different times are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : species ] .",
    "the constant increase of the central number densities of h , h@xmath2 , c , and co over time is caused by the contraction of the filament along the radial direction . on the other hand , @xmath11 and @xmath12 remain almost unchanged over time as they recombine when the filament becomes denser . in the upper left panel",
    "we also show the number density of all h atoms ( divided by two in order to be comparable to @xmath13 ) . in the centre of the filament",
    "most of the hydrogen is bound in h@xmath2 , only outside @xmath14 0.1 pc , where the black and purple line start to differ , hydrogen mainly occurs in atomic or ionised form .",
    "hence , there is a gradual conversion of h@xmath10 over h to h@xmath2 towards the centre of the filament as well as of c@xmath10 over c to co , with @xmath15 exceeding @xmath16 at @xmath14 0.1 pc as well .",
    "next , we study the influence of the isrf and crir on the properties of the filaments ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : species ] ) .",
    "increasing the crir naturally results in a higher ionisation fraction of gas .",
    "this is reflected by the abundances of h@xmath10 and c@xmath10 , which are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher in runs with .",
    "also @xmath17 shows a slight increase with increasing crir , which is due to the larger amount of energy released by various dissociation reactions caused by cosmic rays .",
    "increasing the strength of the isrf only marginally affects the chemical composition of the gas .",
    "however , @xmath17 and @xmath5 are increased by a few kelvin , which is most likely due to the increased photoelectric heating .",
    "interestingly , we find that for all runs @xmath5 decreases towards the centre of the filaments .",
    "we attribute this to the progressive attenuation of the isrf  mainly responsible for dust heating  towards the centre of the filament ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "assuming a polytropic relation @xmath18 , we find @xmath19 to be in a range from 0.9 to 0.95 , which is in good agreement with herschel observations by @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath17 and @xmath5 are markedly different , which requires independent measurements for both quantities in observations .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that the collisional coupling between gas and dust at is not yet strong enough to assure similar temperatures .",
    "it can also be seen that the ratio @xmath20 is not constant along the radial direction .",
    "there is a strong decline of @xmath21 with increasing radius of about 2 orders of magnitude , which is due to the fact that the formation of co happens at somewhat smaller radii ( i.e. higher gas column densities ) than that of h@xmath2 .",
    "our work therefore suggests that caution is recommended when using co line intensities ( i.e. the x - factor ) to obtain total gas masses . in the centre of the filament , however , @xmath21 is comparable for all our runs with a value around @xmath22 , and thus in good agreement with observations .",
    "the simulations were carried out on computing nodes with 2 - 5 gb memory per cpu , which corresponds to state - of - the - art computing nodes at modern supercomputing facilities .",
    "we compare our runs with an isothermal ( @xmath23 = 15 k ) simulation without a chemical network .",
    "we find that the inclusion of the network increases the computation costs per timestep by roughly a factor of 5  7 .",
    "we present first results of simulations of star forming filaments using  to our knowledge  the largest chemical network ever applied in 3d - mhd simulations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , combining the versatile chemistry package krome @xcite with the treecol algorithm @xcite .",
    "we show that in terms of memory consumption such simulations are feasible on modern supercomputers .",
    "the results appear to be promising and in good agreement with observational results .",
    "this work paves the way for many future applications : the detailed chemical modelling will allow us to produce synthetic observations of several molecular lines as well as of continuum emission .",
    "furthermore , the simulations can improve our understanding of the x - factor required for the mass determination of gaseous objects .",
    "moreover , the network will allow us to study in detail the evolution of other molecules like h@xmath2o or the cosmic ray tracer h@xmath24 ."
