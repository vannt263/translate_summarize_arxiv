    "<S> the heat of formation of fe - cr alloys undergoes an anomalous change of sign at small cr concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> this observation raises the question whether there are intermetallic phases present in this composition range . here </S>",
    "<S> we report the discovery of several long - range ordered structures that represent ground state phases at zero kelvin . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we have identified a structure at 3.7%  cr with an embedding energy which is 49 mev / cr atom below the solid solution . </S>",
    "<S> this implies there is an effective long - range attractive interaction between cr atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the structures found in this study complete the low temperature - low cr region of the phase diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> ferritic iron - chromium alloys are important materials for structural components in fusion and fission reactors . </S>",
    "<S> the need to understand their behavior under irradiation has recently motivated a significant amount of basic research the results of which have changed our understanding of these systems.@xcite one of the most surprising and challenging observations is the coexistence of short - range order and phase segregation in the same alloy : at low cr - concentrations both experiment @xcite and simulations @xcite have found a short range ordering tendency : cr atoms seek to maximize the number of their fe neighbors . at larger cr concentrations , however , phase segregation is observed , i.e. cr atoms favor cr neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> some insight into the origin of this peculiar behavior has been provided by several first - principles calculations @xcite which found a negative heat of formation at low cr concentrations and an inversion of the heat of formation above approximately @xmath0 cr . </S>",
    "<S> these observations raise two important questions : ( _ i _ ) are there intermetallic phases in the fe  cr system which are missing in the phase diagram as we know it , i.e. is there long - range order ? </S>",
    "<S> ( _ ii _ ) is the cr  </S>",
    "<S> cr interaction in the fe host crystal purely repulsive , i.e. do cr atoms in fe behave like a lattice gas , or is there an effective attraction between the cr atoms ? in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will demonstrate by means of density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations that ( _ i _ ) there are several intermetallic phases at small cr concentrations and that ( _ ii _ ) some of these phases correspond to an effective _ long - range attractive _ interaction between the cr atoms .            in order to motivate our approach </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic ] a schematic plot which illustrates the consequences of both purely repulsive as well as attractive effective interactions between the cr atoms . for the following qualitative discussion </S>",
    "<S> we treat the fe matrix as an effective medium into which the cr atoms are embedded . </S>",
    "<S> the energy gained if a single cr atom is removed from a bulk cr crystal and inserted into a pure fe matrix defines the heat of solution for a single ( isolated ) impurity , i.e. the _ embedding energy _ at infinite dilution which is indicated by the horizontal dashed lines in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic ] and [ fig : results](a ) . in the case of purely repulsive cr - cr interactions adding any other number of cr atoms </S>",
    "<S> can only render the embedding energy _ per cr atom _ less negative which leads to the shaded region in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic ] . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , if attractive forces are present there will be configurations in which the embedding energy per cr atom is _ more _ negative than the dilute limit as indicated by the solid circles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic ] . in either case , since the alloy segregates for larger amounts of cr , the embedding energy must eventually become positive as more and more cr atoms are added . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it should be noted that in the case of purely repulsive interactions intermetallic phases are possible but need not exist . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the interaction is attractive intermetallic phases _ must _ exist .    in alloy thermodynamics , instead of considering the embedding energy , </S>",
    "<S> it is more common to describe a system in terms of the formation energy ( identical to the mixing energy in the case of a random system ) , which is the energy _ per atom _ of the alloy compared to the fully separated components ( both fe and cr ) . </S>",
    "<S> if one adopts this view the embedding energy at infinite dilution determines the slope of the dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results](b ) . if the cr  </S>",
    "<S> cr interaction is purely repulsive , all configurations with finite cr concentration lie _ above _ this line , whereas at least some phases must lie _ below _ this line if there is some attraction .    in several previous studies @xcite the formation energies of a number of fe  </S>",
    "<S> cr configurations were calculated using supercells derived from the conventional two - atom body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) cell ( also compare fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] ) . on the basis of these data </S>",
    "<S> one would have to conclude that the interaction between cr atoms is purely repulsive .    in the present study </S>",
    "<S> we have followed an alternative approach . </S>",
    "<S> we systematically generated a large number of structures in which the cr atoms selectively occupy certain neighbor shells . </S>",
    "<S> no restrictions were imposed with regard to the symmetry of the cr sublattice . </S>",
    "<S> specifically we did not construct our supercells on the basis of the conventional two - atom body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) unit cell but considered multiples of the primitive cell . </S>",
    "<S> any supercell employed in the present work contains exactly one cr atom and is uniquely determined by an integer matrix , @xmath1 , which relates the matrix of primitive cell vectors , @xmath2 , to the vectors spanning the supercell , @xmath3 , @xmath4 where the sum convention applies . </S>",
    "<S> note that the determinant of @xmath1 equals the number of atoms in the supercell . using appropriate matrices @xmath1 one can construct supercells with a variety of different symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> specifically supercells with face - centered cubic ( fcc ) and simple cubic ( sc ) symmetries are obtained if one uses integer multiples of the matrices @xmath5    we generated a large set of different supercells focusing on structures with a depletion of cr atoms in the first five neighbor shells . </S>",
    "<S> we then employed dft to calculate the total energies for these structures @xcite and obtained the formation energies from @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the number of fe atoms in the supercell , @xmath8 is the total energy for the supercell , @xmath9 is the total energy of the structurally identical pure fe cell , and @xmath10 is the energy per atom obtained from a primitive anti - ferromagnetic cr cell . if @xmath11 is divided by the number of cr atoms in the cell one obtains the embedding energy per cr atom , @xmath12 , whereas division by the total number of atoms yields the formation energy , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> special care was taken to minimize the error in our calculations by varying the cell shape and volume to reduce strain effects . </S>",
    "<S> formation energies were calculated exclusively as differences between fully equivalent supercells using fully equivalent @xmath14-point grids .    </S>",
    "<S> the key results of our calculations are compiled in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] . </S>",
    "<S> the embedding energy at infinite dilution has been obtained using a 108-atom fcc supercell ( 0.9%  cr ) . for this structure </S>",
    "<S> the neighbor shells of any cr atom are depleted of other cr atoms except for the 25th shell for which 12 out of 36 neighbors are cr . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a cr  cr separation of @xmath15 along the @xmath16 direction where @xmath17 is the bcc lattice parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the embedding energy obtained for this cell is @xmath18 and henceforth is considered as the infinite dilution limit . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the lowest concentration of 1.9%  considered in previous studies corresponds to a structure in which the closest cr  cr separation is @xmath19 along the @xmath20 direction and which yields an embedding energy of @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> our most important discovery is that there are several structures the energies of which lie below the line given by the infinite dilution limit . </S>",
    "<S> according to the discussion above the location of these data points implies that there is a net attractive interaction between cr atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the structure which shows by far the lowest energy per cr atom is marked in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] by the leftmost black circle ( s1 ) . in this 27-atom supercell with 3.7%  cr </S>",
    "<S> the cr atoms are arranged on a bcc superlattice three times as large as the underlying bcc fe lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the first nine neighbor shells are exclusively occupied by fe atoms whereas the 10th shell is filled to one quarter by cr atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the cr  </S>",
    "<S> cr pairs are aligned along the @xmath22 direction and separated by @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the embedding energy for this structure is @xmath24 which is @xmath25 below the infinite dilution limit . </S>",
    "<S> there are several other structures at concentrations smaller than 3.7%  cr with energies below the infinite dilution limit . </S>",
    "<S> they resemble the lowest energy structure in that they display a depletion of cr atoms at short range and partly or fully cr filled shells at longer range .    for concentrations larger than 3.7%  cr the structure with the lowest energy ( s2 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] ) is based on a 16-atom base - centered monoclinic unit cell with lattice vectors @xmath26 the s2 structure has an embedding energy of @xmath27 equivalent to a formation energy of @xmath28 . in order to describe this structure on the basis of the conventional two - atom unit cell </S>",
    "<S> , one would have to employ a @xmath29 ( 4096-atom ) supercell . </S>",
    "<S> the s2 structure described here is different from the intermetallic structure described in refs .   and </S>",
    "<S> although both structures correspond to a cr concentration of 6.25% . </S>",
    "<S> the structure described in refs .   and , however </S>",
    "<S> , can be represented in a @xmath30 ( 16-atom ) cubic supercell in which the cr atoms are arranged on a simple cubic lattice with a lattice constant which is twice as large as the lattice constant of the underlying bcc fe matrix . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , its formation energy is only @xmath31 ( compare the open triangle in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] and ref .  ) and thus not as negative as the value calculated of @xmath32 for the s2 structure .    in order to determine the zero temperature phase diagram we consider the energy per the total number of atoms ( formation energy ) as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the infinite dilution limit is indicated by the dashed line and the stable phases are connected by thick solid lines , along which the system decomposes into two - phase mixtures . </S>",
    "<S> the two relevant intermetallic ground state phases occur at 3.7%(s1 ) and 6.25%  ( s2 ) corresponding to the two structures described above .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to address the magnitude of the observed effect . even for the most optimal structures </S>",
    "<S> the energy gain per atom amounts to merely @xmath33 which corresponds to approximately @xmath34 . at higher temperatures </S>",
    "<S> the configurational entropy favors the solid solution . due to the reduced atomic mobility at these low temperatures direct experimental observation of the ordering </S>",
    "<S> may be challenging . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless our discovery suggests that the low temperature phase diagram of fe  cr alloys is more complex than previously thought .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we have demonstrated that there are intermetallic ground state phases at the fe - rich end of the fe  cr phase diagram with embedding energies as low as @xmath24 and formation energies as low as @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of embedding energies below the infinite dilution limit implies that there are effective long - range attractive interactions between the cr atoms which are the result of many - body effects . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , attempts to capture the observed behavior in terms of simple pair interaction models were unsuccessful . </S>",
    "<S> extensive further study is required to elucidate the physical origin of this phenomenon .    this work performed under the auspices of the u.s . </S>",
