    "neutrino oscillation experiments , interpreted in the framework of three active neutrino species , have shown that the mixing angle @xmath0 is considerably smaller than the other two . until recently @xmath0 was actually compatible with being zero at the @xmath19 level . in june 2011",
    "the t2k collaboration reported indication of electron neutrino appearance from a muon neutrino beam of energy about 0.6 gev produced at j - parc , 295 km away from the detector @xcite .",
    "this excludes the hypothesis @xmath20 at the level of 2.5@xmath21 and favors @xmath0 around @xmath22 , not far from the upper limits set by chooz @xcite and by minos @xcite . by itself",
    "such an indication is not conclusive but it adds in an interesting way to other previous hints suggesting a non - vanishing reactor mixing angle in that range .",
    "in particular a tension between the values of the oscillation parameters extracted from kamland and from solar neutrinos is alleviated for @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "a recent global analysis of the data @xcite provides evidence for nonzero @xmath0 at the 3@xmath21 level ^2_13=0.021(0.025)0.007  ( 1 )  .",
    "[ fogli ] the central value 0.15 ( 0.16 ) of @xmath0 depends on the assumed reactor antineutrino flux , with the results from the new flux estimate @xcite shown in parenthesis .",
    "the two other angles are ( at @xmath24 level ) ^2_23=0.42^+0.08_-0.03  ,  ^2_12=0.306(0.312)^+0.018(0.017)_-0.015(0.016 )  .",
    "notice that the difference between new and old fluxes is only relevant for @xmath13 and @xmath0 .",
    "finding a consistent and economic explanation of fermion masses and mixing angles is one of the main open problems in particle physics today .",
    "given the key role traditionally played by symmetries in understanding particle properties , flavour symmetries have captured considerable attention in this context . the peculiar mixing in the lepton sector , with two large angles and a small one , significantly close to simple patterns such as @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "has revived the interest in discrete groups , that naturally incorporate this kind of patterns .",
    "the mentioned pattern is called tribimaximal ( tb ) mixing @xcite and has received much attention in the last years .",
    "many efforts have been made to reproduce it in concrete models and one of the simplest ways is via a non - trivially broken flavour symmetry based on a small discrete group , such as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , see @xcite for reviews . tb mixing is in general obtained in a certain limit of the theory in which corrections are neglected .",
    "deviations thereof are expected to arise from several sources and non - vanishing @xmath0 is predicted .",
    "however , these corrections tend to affect all mixing angles by a similar amount , and , given the good agreement between the predicted and the observed value of the solar mixing angle , only small corrections , up to @xmath30 , are admissible . as a consequence , @xmath31",
    "is also expected to be of order @xmath30 and thus not compatible with the result in eq .",
    "( [ fogli ] ) .",
    "the same arguments apply to other mixing patterns that have been derived from a non - trivial breaking of other discrete groups , such as patterns with @xmath13 given in terms of the golden ratio @xcite or given as @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "also in these cases the good agreement between predicted and observed value of the solar angle suggests that corrections should be small , of the order of few percent .",
    "several attempts have been made to explain largish @xmath0 in a framework predicting tb mixing at leading order ( lo ) : the introduction of corrections leaving one row or column of the mixing matrix unchanged @xcite ; the addition of scalars transforming as non - trivial singlets in @xmath28 models @xcite leading to an explicit breaking of the @xmath33 exchange symmetry of the neutrino sector ( in the charged lepton mass basis ) , see @xcite . ] or the assumption that the different symmetry breaking parameters associated with the neutrino and charged lepton sectors , respectively , are significantly different in size @xcite . in other models",
    "@xcite bimaximal mixing is derived as mixing pattern at lo which requires sizable corrections to the solar mixing angle and easily leads to large @xmath0 as well . however , in this case the atmospheric mixing angle has to be protected from too large corrections and it becomes difficult to precisely predict a particular value for the mixing angles .    in the present note",
    "we change perspective and show that it is indeed possible to derive mixing patterns with @xmath34 at lo from discrete flavour symmetries @xmath1 .",
    "we break @xmath1 in a non - trivial way so that the neutrino and the charged lepton sectors are ( separately ) invariant under two different subgroups of the original group @xmath1 .",
    "we show two examples , based on the flavour groups @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and @xmath14 respectively , in which not only @xmath0 of the correct size is predicted , but also @xmath12 and @xmath13 are close to their experimental best fit values , e.g. for @xmath14 we get @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "in our approach the theory is invariant under a discrete flavour group @xmath1 under which the three generations of su(2)@xmath37 lepton doublets @xmath38 transform as a faithful three - dimensional irreducible representation . the group @xmath1 can be a symmetry of the full lagrangian or just an accidental one arising in some lo approximation , for instance by neglecting operators of high dimensionality .",
    "the lepton mixing matrix @xmath39 is determined by the residual symmetries of the neutrino and the charged lepton sectors . indeed , a crucial assumption is that the neutrino mass matrix @xmath40 and the combination @xmath41 , @xmath42 being the charged lepton mass matrix doublets are on the right of @xmath42 .",
    "] , are separately invariant under the subgroups @xmath2 and @xmath3 of @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we analyse possible mixing patterns independently from a specific model realisation , and therefore we do neither specify the details of the symmetry breaking mechanism nor the transformation properties of fields under @xmath1 other than @xmath43 .",
    "neutrinos are assumed to be majorana particles , which fixes @xmath2 . with a single generation , the only transformation of a majorana neutrino leaving invariant its mass term is a change of sign .",
    "if three generations are present , it can be shown @xcite that the appropriate invariance group of the neutrino sector is the product of two commuting parities , the klein group @xmath44 , allowing for an independent relative change of sign of any neutrino .",
    "we assume @xmath3 to be abelian , since non - abelian subgroups would result in a complete or partial degeneracy of the mass spectrum , a feature difficult to reconcile with the observed charged lepton mass hierarchy .",
    "we choose @xmath9 in our examples .",
    "this is actually the minimal choice of @xmath3 that can ensure three independent mass parameters and allows to uniquely fix the mixing angles in the charged lepton sector , up to permutations .",
    "since we are interested in minimal realisations we require that the generators of the subgroups @xmath2 and @xmath3 give rise to the whole group @xmath1 and not only a subgroup of it , which could otherwise be used as starting point instead of @xmath1 .",
    "we call @xmath45 the three - dimensional representation of @xmath1 for the lepton doublets @xmath38 and the elements @xmath46 of @xmath2 and @xmath47 of @xmath3 are given by matrices @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the invariance requirements read ( g_i)^t m _   ( g_i)=m _  ( g_e i)^m^_e m_e ( g_e i)=m^_e m_e  .",
    "[ ab ] since @xmath45 is a unitary representation and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are abelian , there exist two unitary transformations @xmath50 and @xmath51 that diagonalise the matrices @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( g_i)_diag=_^   ( g_i )   _  ( g_e i)_diag=_e^   ( g_e i )   _ e  . [ cd ] requiring eq.([ab ] ) to be fulfilled has as consequence that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are also the transformations that diagonalise @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "it follows that the lepton mixing matrix is u_pmns=_e^ _  , up to some redefinitions .",
    "indeed @xmath51 and @xmath50 are defined up to a multiplication from the right by a diagonal matrix @xmath52 of phases , _ e _ e k_e _ _ k _ . the phase freedom associated with @xmath53",
    "can be used to remove three phases from the combination @xmath54 , while the phase freedom associated with @xmath55 can be employed to get real and positive eigenvalues of @xmath40 .",
    "after that we are left with three physical phases in @xmath54 : the dirac @xmath4 phase @xmath5 and the two majorana phases .",
    "the latter can not be predicted in our approach since the eigenvalues of @xmath40 remain unconstrained by the requirement in eq.([ab ] ) .",
    "the dirac phase is instead determined by @xmath54 .",
    "similarly to the neutrino masses also the charged lepton masses remain free parameters and thus we can not fix the ordering of both rows and columns of @xmath39 .",
    "we use this freedom by choosing the order that allows mixing angles as close as possible to the experimental best fit values .",
    "note that also the exact value of @xmath5 depends on the actual ordering of rows and columns and thus we can determine its value only up to @xmath18 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ ab],[cd ] ) we see that the mixing matrix @xmath39 is not sensitive to the overall sign of the matrices representing the elements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "moreover if we replace the matrices representing the elements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 by their complex conjugates , the mixing matrix @xmath39 becomes complex conjugated as well .",
    "therefore representations @xmath45 and @xmath56 that differ by an overall sign in the elements @xmath46 and @xmath47 and/or that are related by a complex conjugation are not discussed separately .    finally , concerning the choice of the flavour group @xmath1 , we consider two examples in which @xmath1 is @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "summarising , in our approach the lepton mixing originates from the misalignment of the remnant subgroups in neutrino and charged lepton sectors . with the knowledge of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mixing angles and the phase @xmath5",
    "are predicted , while lepton masses and majorana phases remain unconstrained .",
    "we present two examples in which the lepton mixing matrix has non - vanishing @xmath0 and is determined as outlined above . these examples are based on the two flavour groups @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "they belong to the series @xmath61 , @xmath62 being a natural number , and are subgroups of the ( inhomogeneous ) modular group @xmath63 which is isomorphic to the projective special linear group @xmath64 .",
    "we note that the group @xmath29 with which tb mixing can be predicted is isomorphic to @xmath65 .    in our first example @xmath59 the generators @xmath66 and @xmath67 fulfill the relations @xcite and @xmath67 and the generators @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 chosen in @xcite to define the groups @xmath35 . ]",
    "s^2=(st)^3=t^8=  ,  ( st^-1st)^3=  , [ g8 ] the group has ten conjugacy classes : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the identity , the first number stands for the number of elements in the class and the index denotes the order of the elements .",
    "the group has 96 elements which are of order 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 8 , respectively .",
    "there are ten irreducible representations : two singlets , one doublet , six triplets and one sextet .",
    "the character table of @xmath57 can be found in @xcite .",
    "two of the irreducible triplets are not faithful representations and are not used in our analysis .",
    "the remaining four triplets @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) are related among each other either by an overall change of sign of both @xmath85 and @xmath86 and/or through complex conjugation .",

    "recent results of the t2k experiment and of a global fit of the neutrino oscillation data point to non - vanishing @xmath0 at the 3@xmath21 level .",
    "the best fit value of @xmath0 is around @xmath112 , smaller than the ones of the other angles , but much larger than @xmath113 , the 1@xmath21 experimental error on the solar angle @xmath13 .",
    "if future data confirm this result , many models giving rise at lo to mixing patterns with vanishing @xmath0 , such as tb mixing , become disfavoured , because corrections , expected in these models , generically lead to too small @xmath0 . a particular elegant mechanism to produce simple mixing patterns",
    "is based on discrete flavour symmetries .",
    "the latter are broken in a non - trivial way and as a consequence give rise to mixing angles whose values only depend on the properties of the flavour symmetry , but not on lepton masses .",
