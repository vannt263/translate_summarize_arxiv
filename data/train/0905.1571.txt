    "the aim of this paper is to study spectral properties and related inverse problems for a connected , non - compact riemannian manifold @xmath2 of dimension @xmath3 with or without boundary .",

    "letting @xmath13 be the coordinate on @xmath14 , we denote the local coordinates on @xmath7 by @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that the riemannian metric @xmath16 on @xmath2 , which is denoted by @xmath17 @xmath18 on @xmath7 , has the following property @xmath19 where @xmath20 if @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is a constant .",
    "the metric @xmath24 on @xmath9 is allowed to be different for different ends .",
    "we shall assume either @xmath2 has no boundary or each @xmath9 , consequently @xmath2 itself , has a boundary . in the latter case , we impose dirichlet or neumann boundary condition on @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the laplace - beltrami operator associated with the metric @xmath16 .",
    "one can then define a scattering operator @xmath28 , which is a bounded operator on @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the energy parameter , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the set of exceptional points to be defined in ( [ s3:exceppoints ] ) .",

    ". , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] [ pic 1 ]    [ main thm ] suppose we are given two manifolds @xmath35 , of the form ( [ s1:omega ] ) having @xmath36 ends , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , equipped with the metric @xmath39 satisfying the assumption ( [ eq : sec1decayassumsr ] ) .",
    "assume that @xmath40 and @xmath41 on @xmath40 , moreover @xmath42 for all @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the set of exceptional points for @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath47 and @xmath48 are isometric as riemannian manifolds with metrics @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "this means that if we observe waves coming in and going out of one end @xmath51 , which is assumed to be non - perturbed , we can identify the whole manifold @xmath2 .",
    "note that in theorem [ main thm ] , neither the number of ends of each @xmath52 nor the metric on the manifold @xmath53 are assumed to be known a - priori .",
    "the key idea of the proof is to introduce generalized eigenfunctions of the laplace - beltrami operator which are exponentially growing at infinity , and define the associated _ non - physical _ scattering amplitude .",
    "the crucial fact is that this non - physical scattering amplitude is the analytic continuation of the _ physical _ scattering amplitude .",
    "then the physical scattering amplitude determines the non - physical scattering amplitude , which further determines the neumann - dirichlet map of the _ interior _ domain . by the boundary control method ( see @xcite ) , one can determine the metric inside .    in this paper",
    ", we exclusively deal with the neumann boundary condition .",
    "the other cases are treated similarly and in fact more easily .",
    "the forward problem , i.e. , the existence and completeness of wave operators , the eigenfunction expansion and the representation of s - matrices are well - known for short - range perturbations ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the new issue we have to discuss in this paper is the difference of conormal derivatives on the boundary associated with unperturbed and perturbed metrics .",
    "therefore , focusing on this point , we only explain the outline of the proof of the forward problem under the assumption ( [ eq : sec1decayassumsr ] ) following the approach in @xcite , where spectral theory and inverse problems on hyperbolic spaces are developed in an elementary way .    in the cylindrical ends ,",
    "the physical generalized eigenfunction of the laplace - beltrami operator admits the analytic continuation with respect to the energy parameter , and this analytically continued eigenfunction is exponentially growing as @xmath54 .",
    "this sort of non - physical exponentially growing generalized eigenfunction was first introduced by faddeev to develop the multi - dimensional gelfand - levitan theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "the exponentially growing solutions of schrdinger equation was rediscovered in 1980 s , where the new feature is its utility in the inverse scattering from a fixed energy as well as in the inverse boundary value problem ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the review @xcite ) .",
    "the interesting fact is that this apparently mysterious exponentially growing generalized eigenfunctions appear naturally in the cylindrical domain . using these exponentially growing eigenfunctions , it is possible to obtain , from the scattering operator @xmath55 , the gelfand spectral data on a part of the boundary @xmath56 of the non - compact manifold @xmath57 .",
    "the gelfand boundary data for this case is the family of the neumann - dirichlet map , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the solution to the boundary value problem @xmath61 to solve this problem , we use the boundary control ( bc ) method ( see @xcite for the pioneering work and @xcite , @xcite for the detailed exposition ) .",
    "we note that typically the bc method deals with inverse problem on compact manifolds .",
    "the case of non - compact manifold considered here requires substantial modifications into the method , since the spectrum is no more discrete and it is also impossible to use eigenfunctions as coordinate functions .",
    "a short description of the bc - method for non - compact manifolds was given in @xcite .",
    "here we provide detailed constructions for the considered case of a manifold with asymptotically cylindrical ends .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "sections 2 , 3 , 4 are devoted to a detailed analysis of scattering on manifolds with asymptotically cylindrical ends .",
    "after some preliminary estimates for the case of a half - cylinder with a product metric in  2 , we discuss the spectral properties of the laplacin in @xmath2 in",
    " 3 . using these properties",
    ", we develop the scattering theory for such manifolds in  4 .",
    "the remaining part of the paper , sections 5 , 6 are devoted to the inverse scattering . in  4 , we show that @xmath55 determines the neumann - dirichelt map @xmath58",
    ". an important step , which at the moment requires the product structure of the metric on @xmath62 , is the recovery , from physical scattering matrix @xmath55 , the non - physical scattering amplitude . at last ,  6 is devoted to the development of the b - method for non - compact manifolds . for the convenience of the reader , interested predominantly in the inversion methods",
    ", we make this section independent of the previous ones .",
    "our manifold @xmath2 is a mathematical model of compound waveguides , e.g. settings of optical and electric cables , oil , gas and water pipelines , etc , which are the most typical geometric constructions encountered in the every - day life . as for the inverse problem ,",
    "many works have been devoted so far to the distribution of resonances for the waveguides ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
