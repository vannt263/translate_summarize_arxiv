    "the compact radio continuum sources comprising w51 ( @xcite ) have long been recognized to constitute some of the most luminous star formation regions in the disk of the galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the high luminosity , the large number of inferred o type stars ( @xcite ) , and the location of these sources within a molecular cloud ( @xcite ) all suggest that the w51 region represents the early formation stages of an ob association .",
    "besides the intrinsic interest in the properties of w51 , this region represents one of the closest analogs in the disk of the milky way to the more vigorous star forming sites found in other galaxies ( e.g. 30  doradus ) .",
    "since these latter regions are quite distant , w51 affords many advantages in investigating the detailed properties of luminous star forming sites and inferring how these regions may originate .",
    "one key to understanding the formation and evolution of any star forming region is establishing the properties of the molecular cloud out of which the stars form . while the molecular gas in the w51 region has been the subject of numerous studies , the interpretation of the results remain controversial .",
    "scoville & solomon  ( 1973 ) , primarily on the basis of small strip maps in @xmath1co(10 ) , identified several molecular line components toward w51 and derived a minimum mass of @xmath12  m  and a diameter @xmath92030pc for the molecular cloud that they associated with the most intense radio component at @xmath136 cm ( g49.5 - 0.4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "they further suggested that this cloud might be physically related to the several thermal radio continuum sources that make up the w51 hii - region complex ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent studies of the molecular gas toward w51 have confirmed the existence of a large molecular cloud ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , although various models continue to be proposed for the relationship of the multiple spectral features seen in the molecular gas lines and their association with the different hii regions .",
    "the primary difficulty in establishing a definitive model of this region is the unique location of w51 in the galaxy with respect to the sun .",
    "the w51 region has classically been associated with the tangent point of the sagittarius spiral arm , which is oriented such that the line of sight toward w51 intersects the spiral arm over several kiloparsecs of path length ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "much of the uncertainty surrounding the w51 region stems from establishing whether the numerous radio continuum sources and molecular clouds represent a single , large massive star forming region , or the chance projection of unrelated star forming sites viewed down a spiral arm . to better place the w51 region in context with respect to its location in the galactic plane , figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "displays the integrated @xmath1co(10 )  emission in 10km0.2em s@xmath7  velocity bins covering longitudes 4055  from the massachusetts - stony brook @xmath1co  survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "the w51 region is distinguished by bright @xmath1co  emission extending over a 1@xmath31  area centered on ( @xmath14 )  @xmath9(49.5 , -0.2 ) at velocities @xmath1555km0.2em s@xmath7 .",
    "a `` 3d '' view of the ( @xmath16 ) @xmath1co  data cube covering the region surrounding w51 is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the @xmath1co  isointensity contour surface in this figure clearly illustrates both the relatively large number of smaller molecular clouds with typical internal velocity dispersions of @xmath1735km0.2em s@xmath7 , and the large concentration of @xmath1co  emission extending over a @xmath920km0.2em s@xmath7  interval in the w51 region .",
    "much of the @xmath1co   emission in this area has centroid velocities that exceed the maximum velocity permitted by pure circular rotation ( i.e. @xmath18 @xmath95457km0.2em s@xmath7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "such velocities have long been noted in 21  cm hi surveys at longitudes near @xmath19 , and have been attributed to large - scale streaming motions of gas in a spiral density wave ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in principle",
    "the extent and properties of the molecular clouds located in the w51 region can be established by using the kinematic information in the molecular line data to isolate individual clouds . in practice , previous surveys have had either poor resolution or sparse sampling to make such an attempt feasible .",
    "therefore , we have obtained full beam sampled maps of the w51 region in both @xmath1co(10 )  and @xmath2co(10 )  at subarcminute resolution in order to determine the relationship between the various molecular components .",
    "these maps permit us to disentangle the blends of unrelated clouds along the line of sight and to obtain more accurate mass estimates of the molecular gas .",
    "these data can also be compared with similar maps of more nearby clouds that have recently been obtained by us and others .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ obs ] ,",
    "the observing procedures are described and channels maps of the @xmath1co  and @xmath2co  emission are presented .",
    "analysis of the different spectral features observed in these maps and a more thorough discussion of the main features associated with the compact radio continuum sources in w51 is given in section  [ analysis ] .",
    "in section  [ discussion ] , we discuss the current massive star formation events in the region with respect to the various molecular components and comment on the evolution of the w51 giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ summary ] .",
    "a 1.39  x  1.33  region ( 100  x  96  pixels ) toward the w51 region was mapped in @xmath1co(10 )  ( 115.271203  ghz ) and @xmath2co(10 )  ( 110.201370  ghz ) in april  1995 using the quarry receiver array ( @xcite ) on the fcrao 14  m telescope .",
    "the full width at half maximum beam size of the 14 meter antenna at these frequencies is 45  and 47  at 110 and 115 ghz respectively .",
    "the data were taken in position switching mode and calibrated with the standard chopper wheel method of observing an ambient temperature load and sky emission .",
    "the backends for each pixel of the array consisted of an autocorrelator spectrometer set to span the velocity range from @xmath9 0100km0.2em s@xmath7  at 78  khz sampling ( 0.20km0.2em s@xmath7  @ 115  ghz ) and 94  khz resolution ( 0.24km0.2em s@xmath7 ) . during data reduction",
    "the spectra were smoothed to a velocity resolution of 0.5km0.2em s@xmath7 .",
    "previous fcrao measurements indicate that the spillover and scatter efficiency ( @xmath20 ) of the telescope and radome is @xmath90.7 at the observed frequencies .",
    "the observed antenna temperatures corrected by @xmath20 are presented as @xmath21  ( @xcite ) .",
    "a further correction , the source coupling efficiency ( @xmath22 ) , accounts for the coupling of the beam to the source . for a uniform source that fills only the main beam of the 14  m telescope ,",
    "@xmath22 is @xmath90.7 ( i.e. 30% of the power is scattered on angular sizes much greater than the fwhm beam size ) , while for sources with uniform intensity over a diameter of 30 , @xmath22 is 1.0 . in practice ,",
    "the observed structures in the @xmath1co  and @xmath2co  maps span a range of sizes and shapes , and applying a single coupling efficiency for the entire map is incorrect . for simplicity , we present and analyze the data in the @xmath21  temperature scale .",
    "the typical rms noise in the @xmath1co  and @xmath2co  maps in 0.5km0.2em s@xmath7  channels is @xmath23@xmath21  @xmath90.7  k and 0.6  k respectively .",
    "images of the integrated @xmath1co  and @xmath2co  intensity ( @xmath24 in 2km0.2em s@xmath7  wide intervals are presented in figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] respectively in the velocity range from 40 to 70km0.2em s@xmath7 .",
    "the values printed in the upper left corner of each figure panel denote the centroid velocity of the particular interval .",
    "extended @xmath1co  and @xmath2co   emission was detected between 0km0.2em s@xmath7  and 25km0.2em s@xmath7 , but these data are not presented here .",
    "this low velocity emission most likely originates from local molecular clouds and is not related to the w51 region of interest here .",
    "little emission was observed between 25 and 35km0.2em s@xmath7  and at velocities in excess of 75km0.2em s@xmath7  ( see  [ analysis ] ) .",
    "similar velocity structure is also observed in the 21  cm hi emission lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "the following section analyzes the velocity structure in the molecular line maps and identifies individual molecular clouds .",
    "the @xmath1co  and @xmath2co  emission toward the w51 region contains a number of discrete velocity components that overlap in projection both spatially and kinematically . to identify and isolate the emission from these velocity components , multiple gaussians convolved with the spectrometer channel widths were fitted to each spectrum in an automated manner .",
    "the free parameters for each gaussian were the amplitude of the spectral line , the mean velocity , and the line width .",
    "the number of gaussians fitted to each spectrum was determined by searching for contiguous channels that contain an integrated intensity with a signal to noise ratio @xmath25 3 .",
    "channels containing a local antenna temperature maxima ( denoted here as channels @xmath26 ) in each such section were then identified .",
    "a local maximum at channel @xmath27 was deemed a `` significant '' peak if the antenna temperature in any channel between c@xmath28 and the neighboring local maximum at channels @xmath29 and @xmath30 decreased by more than 2@xmath31 from the antenna temperature at channel @xmath27 .",
    "the number of significant peaks corresponded to the number of gaussians fitted to that section .",
    "each spectrum was smoothed to a velocity resolution of 1.5km0.2em s@xmath7  prior to identifying the peaks , although the fits were performed on the 0.5km0.2em s@xmath7  resolution data .",
    "spectra with large residuals with respect to the gaussian fits were visually inspected and additional gaussians were added as appropriate .",
    "the @xmath2co  data were easily decomposed into gaussians in this manner , but it often became difficult to reliably identify the velocity features in the heavily blended @xmath1co  lines .",
    "also , toward the compact hii regions , some of the structure in the @xmath1co  and @xmath2co   line profiles can be attributed to the absorption of radiation from hot molecular gas by colder foreground material ( see @xcite ) .",
    "away from these compact regions , absorption effects are not as significant , and over most of the cloud , the peaks in the spectral lines should accurately represent the velocity structure along the line of sight .",
    "the results from the gaussian decomposition of the line profiles are synthesized in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the upper panel shows histograms of the mean velocities for the @xmath1co  ( thick lines ) and @xmath2co  ( thin lines ) gaussians , and the lower panel shows the total integrated intensity in the gaussians as a function of the mean velocity . most of the emission is confined to velocity intervals of 025km0.2em s@xmath7  and 3575km0.2em s@xmath7 .",
    "we identify the 025km0.2em s@xmath7  emission as originating from nearby molecular material and the 3575km0.2em s@xmath7  emission with molecular gas in the sagittarius spiral arm .",
    "several velocity components occur repeatedly in both the @xmath1co  and @xmath2co  gaussian fits as signified by the histogram peaks shown in the top panel in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "in particular , velocity components at 7 , 1525 , 44 , 49 , 53 , 60 , 63 , and 68km0.2em s@xmath7  are readily apparent . in terms of the @xmath1co  and @xmath2co  integrated intensity ,",
    "the two major features are the 60km0.2em s@xmath7  and 63km0.2em s@xmath7  components .",
    "a 58km0.2em s@xmath7  component is indicated as well since that is the centroid velocity of the molecular line emission toward the brightest radio continuum source in the w51 region ( @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , that the 58km0.2em s@xmath7  component is not a prominent feature as judged from figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the following discussion briefly highlights the morphology of the individual velocity components .",
    "the 7km0.2em s@xmath7  velocity component contains weak , narrow lines over nearly the entire mapped region and is undoubtedly a nearby molecular cloud .",
    "the 1525km0.2em s@xmath7  interval appears to contain a few distinct velocity features ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , but it is unclear whether or not these components are physically related .",
    "the 44km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud is elongated parallel to the galactic plane at @xmath32 , although this cloud may form part of a larger structure that extends to lower galactic latitudes .",
    "the molecular gas at these lower latitudes occurs at velocities of @xmath940km0.2em s@xmath7 , which is outside the velocity range assigned to this feature .",
    "the @xmath1co  emission from the 49 and 53km0.2em s@xmath7  components is more fragmented than the other features mentioned so far .",
    "these fragments may represent either individual clouds or the remnants of a once larger cloud in the galactic plane .",
    "the 53km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud is distinguished by bright @xmath1co  emission near @xmath33 @xmath9@xmath34 that is associated with the compact hii region g49.4 - 0.3 ( see  [ dis : hii ] ) .",
    "the 63km0.2em s@xmath7  component extends for nearly a degree in length and is found mainly in the central and eastern part of the mapped region .",
    "this is best observed in the 66km0.2em s@xmath7  panel shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , which represents the line wing emission of this velocity component ( as well as emission from the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud discussed below ) .",
    "the 60km0.2em s@xmath7  component consists predominantly of a diffuse patch of emission that extends into a filament to the east , and a second filament to the south .",
    "the 60km0.2em s@xmath7  and 63km0.2em s@xmath7  velocity components , along with the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud discussed below , likely correspond to the `` high velocity stream '' of 21  cm hi emission ( @xcite ) that has been attributed to the streaming motions of gas down the sagittarius spiral arm .",
    "careful inspection of the channel maps indicates that the spatial distribution of the 60km0.2em s@xmath7  and 63km0.2em s@xmath7  components generally do not overlap .",
    "for example , the western edge of the 63km0.2em s@xmath7  component closely matches the eastern edge of the 60km0.2em s@xmath7  emission .",
    "this is best seen in figure  [ fig4 ] and the 60km0.2em s@xmath7   and 66km0.2em s@xmath7  velocity panels in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "further , the extended emission from the eastern portion of the 63km0.2em s@xmath7  component is just above the filamentary extension of the 60km0.2em s@xmath7  component .",
    "such interfaces are unlikely to occur by chance from two unrelated clouds along the line of sight , and suggest that the 60 and 63km0.2em s@xmath7  components represent kinematic structure within a single molecular cloud . velocity differences of this magnitude are commonly observed in nearby molecular clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the 58km0.2em s@xmath7  component is dominated by bright , compact molecular emission and does not contain the diffuse extended emission that characterizes the 60 and 63km0.2em s@xmath7  features .",
    "inspection of the channel maps suggests that this velocity component also reflects the interval kinematic structure within a single cloud encompassing the 60km0.2em s@xmath7  and 63km0.2em s@xmath7  clouds .",
    "for example , the emission from the filament protruding to the southern portion of the mapped region contains primarily a centroid velocity of 58km0.2em s@xmath7  closest to bright compact @xmath1co  and @xmath2co  emission .",
    "further away from this bright , compact emission region , the velocity of the filament changes to @xmath960km0.2em s@xmath7 .",
    "similar velocity patterns are observed in emission features along the eastern and western edges of the map .",
    "these results suggest that the emission constituting the 58 , 60 , and 63km0.2em s@xmath7  components represent the internal velocity structure within a single molecular cloud .",
    "koo  ( 1997 ) reached similar conclusions concerning the atomic hydrogen clouds at these velocities based upon hi absorption observations toward the radio continuum sources .",
    "since the bright @xmath1co  emission associated with the 58km0.2em s@xmath7  and 60km0.2em s@xmath7  components are coincident with the brightest radio continuum source in the w51 region ( g49.5 - 0.5 ; see  [ dis : hii ] ) , we henceforth refer to the 586063km0.2em s@xmath7   components as the w51 molecular cloud .",
    "the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  component extends for @xmath91  east  west across the image and also likely constitutes part of the `` high velocity stream '' identified in hi surveys ( @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the 68km0.2em s@xmath7   filament is located at the southern edge of the diffuse emission associated with the w51 molecular cloud at velocities @xmath1563km0.2em s@xmath7  ( see figs .  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "again , such a clear truncation of the w51 molecular cloud at the location of the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud is unlikely to occur from two random clouds along the line of sight , and strongly suggests that these two clouds are physically related objects at a common distance . nonetheless , the elongated appearance of the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud is in stark contrast to the roughly circular shape of the w51 cloud , indicating that these two objects are best treated as individual structures rather than a single molecular cloud .",
    "the physical properties of the molecular clouds in the w51 region can be determined from the gaussian decomposition of the line profiles .",
    "we single out these two clouds since they contain four of the five bright hii regions found in radio continuum surveys ( see  [ dis : hii ] ) . in deriving the properties , the distance to the w51 cloud",
    "is assumed to be 7.0 @xmath35 1.5  kpc as determined from proper motion studies of the w51main @xmath36 maser in the g49.5 - 0.4 dense core ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud was assumed to have the same distance based on its apparent association with the w51 cloud as discussed above .",
    "the other clouds are not included in this analysis since their distances are unknown .",
    "the properties of the w51 and 68km0.2em s@xmath7  clouds are summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the cloud size represents a visual estimate of the extent of the detectable @xmath1co  emission along the major ( @xmath37 ) and minor ( @xmath38 ) axis of the cloud .",
    "the cloud line width , @xmath39 , is the full width at half maximum of the sum of the gaussian fits comprising the respective clouds .",
    "two estimates of the cloud mass are provided in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the virial mass , @xmath40 , was calculated using the expression @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the full width at half maximum line width in kilometers per second and @xmath43 is the cloud radius ( @xmath44 ) in parsecs at the zero intensity level .",
    "while the cloud size is actually measured at a finite @xmath1co  intensity level , we find it unlikely that the clouds are appreciably larger at lower intensities , and no correction to the observed cloud size was applied .",
    "note that the above expression for the virial mass is appropriate for a uniform density , spherical cloud .",
    "the equivalent expression for a @xmath45 and @xmath46 density cloud would decrease the constant factor in the virial mass expression to 188 and 125 respectively .",
    "a second mass estimate can in principal be obtained from the @xmath1co  and @xmath2co   data using the lte analysis ( @xcite ) . however , in blended regions ,",
    "it is often difficult to associate @xmath1co  gaussian fits with analogous @xmath2co   features . therefore , the h@xmath11  column densities were estimated by applying a constant conversion factor to the @xmath1co  integrated intensities ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . to ensure that the galactic conversion factor is indeed valid for the w51 region , the conversion factor was estimated from lines of sight with unblended @xmath1co  and @xmath2co  lines in the 5671km0.2em s@xmath7  velocity interval that defines the w51 and 68km0.2em s@xmath7  clouds .",
    "the h@xmath11  column densities for these lines of sight were estimated using the procedure outlined by dickman  ( 1978 ) and assuming a @xmath2co / h@xmath11  abundance of 1.5  x  10@xmath47 .",
    "a histogram of the ratio of the h@xmath11  column densities to @xmath1co  integrated intensities is strongly peaked with a mean value of 1.7  x  10@xmath48  @xmath49  ( kkm0.2em s@xmath7)@xmath7 , and is similar to the conversion factor that has been derived for the galaxy ( between @xmath9 2 - 3  x  10@xmath48  @xmath49  ( kkm0.2em s@xmath7)@xmath7 ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the masses ( @xmath50 ) computed from the @xmath1co   integrated intensities were calculated by adopting the conversion factor derived from the w51 data , and include a multiplicative factor of 1.36 to incorporate the mass contribution from heavier elements .",
    "the results summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] indicate that the w51 molecular cloud has a mean diameter of @xmath997  pc and a mass  cloud and several other velocity components that we did not associate with the w51 molecular cloud .",
    "] of @xmath910@xmath51 .",
    "the similarity in the two mass estimates indicate the gravitational potential energy is approximately equal to the kinetic energy , and that self ",
    "gravity must play a critical role in the evolution of the w51 molecular cloud .",
    "the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud is 136  pc in length but only 22  pc wide over most of the minor axis .",
    "such an obvious departure from spherical symmetry renders the virial mass estimate suspect , and so the mass of the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud was estimated only using the @xmath1co  conversion factor .",
    "the mass obtained , @xmath910@xmath52 , is an order of magnitude less than that of the w51 cloud .",
    "a comparison of the w51 cloud properties with the size and mass spectrum of molecular clouds in the galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) shows that the w51 molecular cloud is one the largest gmcs in the galactic disk . among the @xmath95000 molecular clouds with diameters in excess of @xmath922  pc ( and corresponding masses @xmath910@xmath52",
    "; i.e. gmcs ) , the w51 gmc is in the upper 1% of the clouds by size and the upper 510% by mass . for the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud , although its mass is typical of a relatively low mass gmc , a distinguishing feature is its shape .",
    "the ratio of the major to minor axis of the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud is @xmath96 . in the cloud catalog by solomon et  al .",
    "( 1987 ) , 85% of the clouds have an aspect ratio less than 2 , and only one object has an aspect ratio greater than observed for the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud .",
    "clearly an elongated shape over such a large length scale is unusual in the molecular interstellar material and may indicate that the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud is a transient structure originating from a relatively recent dynamical event .",
    "now that the individual molecular clouds in the w51 region have been identified , their relationship to the massive star forming sites can be explored .",
    "three images of the w51 region are shown in figure  [ fig6 ] : a map of the integrated @xmath1co(10 )  intensity generated from gaussian fits with mean velocities between 56 and 71km0.2em s@xmath7  ( i.e. the w51 and 68km0.2em s@xmath7  clouds ) , an image of the 60  emission from the iras sky survey atlas , and a @xmath1321  cm radio continuum image ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bulk of the 60   emission is elongated parallel to , but slightly below , the galactic plane , and is coincident with bright radio continuum emission . of the sources labeled in the @xmath1321  cm continuum map ,",
    "w51c has predominantly a non  thermal continuum spectrum and is thought to be a supernova remnant ( @xcite ) , while the other sources have thermal spectra and are compact hii regions .",
    "the radio continuum sources g49.4 - 0.3 and g49.5 - 0.4 are classically referred to as w51a ( @xcite ) , with the g49.5 - 0.4 region containing the infrared source w51irs1 ( @xcite ) and the @xmath36 masers w51north , w51south , and w51main ( @xcite ) .",
    "sources g48.9 - 0.3 , g49.1 - 0.4 , and g49.2 - 0.4 are collectively known as w51b ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed radio continuum fluxes ( @xcite ) and far  infrared luminosities ( @xmath9 10@xmath53 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) imply the presence of one or more o stars in each of these regions .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows that many of the radio continuum sources have corresponding peaks in the molecular line and far  infrared images .",
    "in addition to the spatial coincidences , these radio continuum sources have recombination line velocities ( @xcite ) similar to the velocity components identified from the @xmath1co  observations . the g49.5 - 0.4 hii region has a recombination line velocity of 59km0.2em s@xmath7  and is spatially coincident with the strong @xmath1co  emission associated with the w51 molecular cloud .",
    "the recombination line velocities toward g48.9 - 0.3 , g49.1 - 0.4 , and g49.2 - 0.4 are 66 , 72 , and 66km0.2em s@xmath7  respectively and are located along the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  molecular cloud .",
    "finally , the g49.4 - 0.3 hii region has a recombination line velocity of 53km0.2em s@xmath7  and is coincident with the bright @xmath1co   and @xmath2co  emission from the 53km0.2em s@xmath7  molecular cloud .",
    "( note that the molecular gas associated with this hii region is outside the velocity range that defines the w51 gmc . ) hi ( @xcite and h@xmath54co ( @xcite ) spectra toward this source exhibit absorption features at velocities of 63 - 65km0.2em s@xmath7 , indicating that g49.4 - 0.3 must be located behind the w51 gmc .",
    "however , these observations do not indicate whether this source is situated just beyond w51 and hence is physically related to the hii region complex , or if it is a distant , unrelated background massive star forming site .",
    "the molecular line maps presented here provide no compelling reason for ( or against ) such an association .    to search for any additional massive star forming sites in the w51 molecular cloud ,",
    "the iras point source catalog was examined for objects that have at least two `` high '' quality detections among the four iras bands and a rising spectral energy distribution toward longer wavelengths .",
    "these criteria were designed to select a reliable sample of objects with far - infrared colors characteristic of embedded star forming regions ( @xcite ) . of the 40 iras point sources within the mapped region that meet these criteria ,",
    "the seven brightest objects at 25  are located along the interface between the w51 and the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  clouds .",
    "visual inspection of iras 60  image in figure  [ fig6 ] confirms that the brightest sources are located along this ridge . assuming that the other point sources are located at the distance of the w51 molecular cloud ( although many of them are almost certainly foreground objects ) , point sources found away from this interface have far - infrared luminosities in the four iras bands less than 40,000  @xmath55  and inferred spectral types later than zams b0.5 ( @xcite ) . thus embedded o type stars in the w51 region currently are confined to the southern extreme of the molecular cloud .",
    "the extreme star formation characteristics of the w51 region raises the question as to whether the star formation activity stems from unusual _ global _ properties in the w51 molecular cloud , or from unusual conditions found _ local _ to the massive star forming sites .",
    "these possibilities can be explored by comparing the w51 cloud properties with other star forming regions that have also been extensively mapped in @xmath1co  and @xmath2co .",
    "in particular , we shall compare the w51 and 68km0.2em s@xmath7  clouds with the molecular clouds associated with the hii regions sh  140 , sh  155 , sh  235 , sh  247 , sh  252 , and sh  255 which have been mapped with the same receiver and telescope used for the w51 observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the embedded high mass stellar content in this comparison sample is generally limited to a single early ",
    "b / late o  type star and is in stark contrast to the cluster of o stars forming in the w51 molecular cloud .",
    "the clouds in the comparison sample have diameters of @xmath92055  pc and masses of @xmath9@xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "thus the w51 molecular cloud is @xmath152.5 times larger and @xmath1510 times more massive than these objects .",
    "note that the molecular clouds associated with sh  247 , sh  252 , and sh  255 are distinct regions within the gem  ob1 cloud complex , which has a total mass of @xmath58  and a diameter of @xmath9150  pc ( @xcite ) . while the spatial size of the gem  ob1 complex is larger than the w51 cloud , the w51 cloud exhibits a continuous structure @xmath9100  pc in size as opposed to the fragmentary appearance of the gem  ob1 complex .",
    "the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud is also more massive than the objects in the comparison sample and is significantly more elongated than any of the clouds considered here .",
    "thus the w51 and 68km0.2em s@xmath7  clouds are at the extreme in terms of cloud masses and sizes compared to objects in this sample . with the possible exception of the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud , these clouds are similar though in that they appear to be gravitationally bound .",
    "the size and mass of a cloud are not necessarily the key parameters that control the star formation activity within the cloud .",
    "intuitively , one might expect that the amount of matter above a critical density to be the critical variable for otherwise similar clouds . thus if the massive star formation activity in w51 has resulted from the large scale collapse of the cloud",
    ", one would expect the volume and column density densities to be larger than found in a typical cloud . as an indirect measure of the h@xmath11  column densities , figure  [ fig7 ] shows histograms of the observed @xmath2co  integrated intensities for each of the clouds in our sample .",
    "the lowest integrated intensity shown for any cloud is 3  kkm0.2em s@xmath7  since that is approximately the highest 3@xmath59 detection limit among the various @xmath2co  surveys .",
    "comparison of the @xmath1co  and @xmath2co  intensities suggests that the @xmath2co  emission is optically thin if the @xmath1co  and @xmath2co  excitation temperatures are equal as assumed in the lte analysis ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the distribution of @xmath2co  integrated intensities should accurately trace the h@xmath11   column density distributions as along as the @xmath2co  abundance is roughly constant within a cloud .",
    "the @xmath2co  integrated intensities in figure  [ fig7 ] can be converted to h@xmath11  column densities for an assumed @xmath2co / h@xmath11  abundance of 1.5  x  10@xmath47 ( @xcite ) with the formula @xmath60 for an excitation temperature of @xmath61 = 10  k , the 3  kkm0.2em s@xmath7  integrated intensity limit imposed for figure  [ fig7 ] corresponds to an h@xmath11  column density of 1.5  x  10@xmath62  @xmath49 , or an visual extinction of @xmath91.5@xmath63   ( @xcite ) .",
    "variations in the @xmath2co  abundance and excitation conditions will obviously effect the absolute conversion from @xmath2co   integrated intensities to h@xmath11  column densities , and the comparisons here are intended to search for large differences ( factors of several or more ) in the typical column densities in these clouds .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows that the distributions of @xmath2co  integrated intensities peak near the detection limit of 3  kkm0.2em s@xmath7  for each cloud , with a long tail toward the higher integrated intensities .",
    "the tail of these distributions correspond to the high column density regions and are often associated with star forming sites .",
    "the mean @xmath2co  integrated intensity among the clouds varies between 4.9 and 9.7  kkm0.2em s@xmath7 , with the w51 cloud containing the third highest mean intensity and the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud the highest .",
    "the high values found for the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud may be a result of an unusual viewing angle , as either this cloud is a sheet of gas observed edge on or a long , narrow filament .",
    "these results imply that most of the mass in each cloud is contained in lines of sight with column densities corresponding to less than a few magnitudes of visual extinction .",
    "thus the w51 gmc is similar to other clouds in that the diffuse envelope contains more mass than the high column density cores .",
    "while the w51 cloud contains a higher column density on average than the other clouds , this can attributed to the fact that it is more than twice as large as some clouds in the sample .",
    "indeed , assuming that the @xmath64   w51 cloud is distributed in a sphere of diameter of 97  pc ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) , the average h@xmath11  volume density is 40  @xmath65 , comparable to the volume density inferred in nearby molecular clouds ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the entire w51 molecular is probably not in an advanced stage of collapse , and that the intense star formation activity in w51 likely results from forces acting on a localized region .",
    "in retrospect , this is perhaps not surprising given that the massive star forming regions in w51 are located at the edge of the cloud and not in the center as expected if , for example , the entire cloud was systematically collapsing .",
    "contrary to the global properties , the gas properties local to the w51 massive star forming regions do appear to be unusual compared to the molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood .",
    "submillimeter continuum observations have shown that the core containing the g49.5 - 0.4 hii region contains @xmath9 10@xmath52  of gas with a mean h@xmath11  volume density of @xmath9 5  x  10@xmath66  @xmath65 over a 3  pc radius region ( @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , submillimeter observations indicate that the most massive cores in nearby molecular clouds typically have masses @xmath923 orders of magnitude less than that of the g49.5 - 0.4 core ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while the g49.5 - 0.4 core does not necessarily contain higher gas densities , it does contain more gas at the densities needed to form stars .",
    "the above discussion suggests that the key to understanding the massive star formation activity in the w51 complex is determining the forces that acted on a localized region within the cloud .",
    "the molecular line maps presented here allow us to speculate on what these forces may be .",
    "as shown in figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , the diffuse emission from the w51 gmc truncates at the location of the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud for velocities @xmath15 63km0.2em s@xmath7 .",
    "this morphology was used in  [ analysis ] to argue that the w51 and 68km0.2em s@xmath7  clouds are at a common distance since such an interface is unlikely to result from the chance superposition of unrelated molecular clouds .",
    "one way such an interface could form is if the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud has collided into the w51 gmc ( see also @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". molecular gas does extend below the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud at lower velocities , however . in this picture ,",
    "given the three dimensional structure of the w51 gmc , this material has not crossed the path of the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud .",
    "both h@xmath11co and hi spectra toward the g49.5 - 0.4 hii region ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) contain absorption lines at velocities @xmath15 65km0.2em s@xmath7 , and relative to the line of sight , the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud must be located in front of the w51 gmc . since the velocity difference between the two clouds ( at least 5  km0.2em s@xmath7 ) is larger than the sound speed , a shock front will form that will compress the molecular gas and possibly induce star formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the qualitative model of two colliding clouds accounts for several properties of the w51 region .",
    "first , one would expect that star formation should occur preferentially along the interface region .",
    "the iras image in figure  [ fig6 ] shows that this is indeed the case for massive stars , as the northern half of the w51 gmc appears devoid of embedded o type stars despite containing most of the cloud mass .",
    "the cloud collision model would also suggest that the massive star forming regions along the collision interface should have a common age . while the ages of these stars are not known , the lifetime of the mid  o type stars found in the w51 region ( @xcite",
    "; see also @xcite ) places an upper limit to the stellar ages of @xmath95  myr ( @xcite )",
    ". the actual ages may be considerably less since these o stars are still in the compact hii region phase , which has a lifetime of less than 1  myr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "further support for a cloud  cloud collision model comes from considering the projected distance ( 73  pc ) between the two furthest separated star forming regions along the w51/68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud interface .",
    "the sound travel time across this distance is nearly two orders of magnitude larger than the o star lifetime .",
    "therefore , these star forming regions must have been created by either a single event operating along the entire southern edge of the cloud or from up to 4 separate , but nearly simultaneous , events .",
    "given the scarcity of embedded o stars in the galaxy , the cloud  collision model would provide a natural explanation for simultaneous star formation along the ridge .",
    "ultimately , the suggested collision between the w51 and 68km0.2em s@xmath7  clouds may be related to a spiral density wave .",
    "the anomalous gas velocities in the w51 region have long been attributed to streaming motions in the sagittarius spiral arm ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the associated spiral density wave may have indirectly led to the massive star formation activity in the w51 region by enhancing the number density of clouds and increasing the probability of a cloud - cloud collision .",
    "further , a spiral wave shock , if present ( see @xcite ) , will compress and flatten any clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , such a shock could account for the highly elongated shape of the 68km0.2em s@xmath7   cloud .",
    "the w51 gmc , however , remains roughly circular in shape , and globally its evolution is likely still dominated by self gravity .    finally , we briefly consider the implications of these results for other star forming regions . while the w51 star forming region exceeds all nearby embedded star forming sites in terms of the number of o stars , bolometric luminosity , and dense core mass , w51 itself is dwarfed by some star forming regions in nearby galaxies .",
    "most notably , the 30 doradus region in the large magellanic cloud contains an order magnitude more o stars than w51 ( @xcite ) . at larger distances ,",
    "many interacting galaxies contain even yet more vigorous massive star forming regions that may be dense enough to represent young globular clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "most of the molecular gas appears to have been dispersed in these clusters already , and in any event , the distances to these systems precludes any detailed studies of the natal clouds .",
    "the most significant piece of information afforded by the w51 molecular maps is that despite containing one of the most massive dense cores known in our galaxy , most of the mass in the w51 molecular cloud is not currently forming massive stars .",
    "thus it is easy to imagine that the increase in the number of cloud  cloud collisions that presumably results in interacting galaxies may lead to a larger number of star forming regions throughout a single cloud or more intense star formation activity within a small region .",
    "in fact , the mass within the w51 molecular cloud is comparable to that in globular clusters , and it may not require the conglomeration of many giant molecular clouds to form these stellar systems , but the large scale collapse of a single gmc .",
    "we have mapped a 1.39  x  1.33  region toward the w51 hii region complex at 45 - 47  resolution and 50  sampling in the j=10 transitions of @xmath1co  and @xmath2co . from these data",
    "we have identified the major molecular clouds and have associated these clouds with the massive embedded star forming sites in the w51 region .",
    "we find that :    \\(1 ) the two most prominent clouds in the w51 region are the 58 - 6063km0.2em s@xmath7   cloud ( defined as the w51 gmc ) and the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud .",
    "the w51 gmc is associated with the brightest @xmath136 cm continuum source in w51 ( g49.5 - 0.4 ) , and the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud contains the hii regions g48.9 - 0.3 ,",
    "g49.1 - 0.4 , and g49.2 - 0.4 . published absorption line spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ) indicate that the fifth bright hii region in the area , g49.4 - 0.3 , must be located behind the w51 gmc , but it remains unclear whether or not it is physically associated with the other star forming regions .",
    "\\(2 ) the mass of the w51 gmc and the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  clouds are @xmath9 1.2@xmath310@xmath51  and @xmath67  respectively .",
    "the w51 molecular cloud is roughly circular in shape with a mean diameter of @xmath997  pc and appears to be gravitationally bound .",
    "compared to the @xmath95000 gmcs in the galactic disk , w51 is among the top 1% by size and the top 510% in terms of cloud mass .",
    "the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud is an elongated filament of @xmath9 136pc@xmath322pc in size",
    ". the 6:1 aspect ratio of the major and minor axis in the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  are rare in the galaxy over such a large size scale ( @xcite ) , and suggests that this molecular cloud may represent a transient feature .",
    "\\(3 ) the properties of the w51 and 68km0.2em s@xmath7  clouds are compared with nearby clouds that have been studied in a similar manner but contain lower levels of massive star formation activity . while the w51 cloud is larger and more massive than nearby clouds , the mean h@xmath11  column density is not unusual given the large size , and the mean h@xmath11  volume density is comparable . the w51 gmc is similar to other clouds in that most of the molecular mass",
    "is contained in a diffuse molecular envelop that is not forming massive stars .",
    "the 68km0.2em s@xmath7  cloud contains the largest mean column density among the clouds studied here , but this may be a result of an unusual viewing angle for this elongated cloud .",
    "we suggest that much of the star formation activity in the w51 region has not resulted from global collapse of the w51 cloud , but from forces acting on localized regions within the cloud .",
    "\\(4 ) we speculate that much of the massive star formation activity in w51 has resulted from a collision between the w51 and 68km0.2em s@xmath7  molecular clouds .",
    "this conjecture can explain the string of embedded o stars that are spread out for 70  pc along the interface between the w5168km0.2em s@xmath7  clouds , and why massive star formation is currently confined to the southern ridge of the w51 gmc .",
