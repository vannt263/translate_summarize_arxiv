    "since the beginning of this millenium , mounting experimental evidence in hadronic spectroscopy puts into question quark models like the godfrey - isgur model  @xcite that successfully described the ground and some low excited states of mesons with open charm or bottom .",
    "this picture was challenged when two narrow resonances with open charm were discovered by the babar  @xcite and cleo collaborations  @xcite , respectively .",
    "these states are now named @xmath0 and @xmath1 and referred to in the following as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "their respective masses were about @xmath6 and @xmath7 below the predictions of the godfrey - isgur quark model . on the other hand ,",
    "the states are located by almost the same amount of about 45  mev below the @xmath2 and @xmath3 thresholds , respectively .",
    "this appears a mere numerical coincidence in quark models , and is a consequence of the parity doubling assumption in refs .",
    "however , as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this can be explained naturally if the systems are bound states of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 meson pairs , respectively  @xcite .",
    "weinberg introduced a model - independent way to quantify the molecular admixture in the wave function of a physical state  @xcite .",
    "the relation between the coupling constant @xmath8 of a hadronic molecule with a mass @xmath9 and a binding energy @xmath10 to its constituents with masses @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the reduced mass @xmath13 is found to be @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the momentum scale related to dynamics not included explicitly , such as effective range corrections or other channels .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is the probability of finding a two - body continuum state in the physical state .",
    "it is thus zero for an elementary particle and one for a pure two - body molecule . for a shallow bound state",
    "whose binding energy is small so that @xmath17 , the pole contribution dominates the @xmath18-matrix elements in the near - threshold region , in particular the scattering length .",
    "this makes @xmath8 in principle accessible to experiment , albeit @xmath2 scattering is not likely to be directly observed experimentally in the near future .",
    "however , the scattering properties can be calculated using lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "indeed , there have been lattice calculations of the @xmath18-wave isoscalar @xmath2 scattering length .",
    "it was calculated directly in ref .",
    "@xcite at two pion masses , and the obtained values agree with the ones from the indirect calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite.in lattice qcd , the isoscalar @xmath2 scattering is relatively difficult because of the presence of the disconnected wick contractions which are of leading order at both the @xmath19 expansion and chiral expansion  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the charmed meson - light meson scattering lengths for the channels which are free of disconnected contractions are calculated , and then the @xmath2 scattering length was extracted  @xcite using unitarized chiral perturbation theory , the parameters of which were determined from fitting to the lattice results . in this sense , we refer to the calculation of the @xmath2 scattering length as `` indirect '' .",
    "these lattice results agree perfectly with the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : weinberg ] ) for @xmath20 taking into account the uncertainties .",
    "this provides strong evidence from the theoretical point of view that the @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath21 molecular states .",
    "however , a clear experimental proof is still missing .",
    "it was stressed in refs .",
    "@xcite that the leading loop contributions to the hadronic widths of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are quite sensitive to @xmath22 and thus allow one to quantify their molecular admixtures experimentally .",
    "especially , no additional counterterm is present at leading order  ( lo ) .",
    "the situation for the radiative decays is less clear . while refs .",
    "@xcite provide predictions , a lo counterterm obstructs a prediction in ref .",
    "@xcite and hampers the sensitivity to the coupling constant @xmath22 .    in this work ,",
    "we reinvestigate the decays of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 in an effective field theory description appropriate for these systems .",
    "our key finding is that the radiative decays of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 are insensitive to their precise nature , contrary to the strong decays .",
    "in particular , the electromagnetic transition rates are not enhanced by the fact that for molecular states the decay has to run via meson loops because of the presence of counterterms . using a different formalism",
    ", we also confirm the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite that radiative decays suffer from a contact interaction with unknown coefficient already at lo .",
    "this supports the claim that only an experimental hadronic width of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the order of @xmath23  kev can be regarded as the smoking gun for a predominantly molecular nature of these two states .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental information available at present is rather limited . at best ,",
    "ratios between hadronic and radiative decays are published , with only upper limits for most transitions .",
    "there is hope that with the advent of high precision and high intensity experiments like @xmath24anda , this situation will be improved significantly .    since heavy quark flavor symmetry connects the open charm and bottom sectors , states similar to the @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath5 are expected in the open bottom sector .",
    "such predictions have been made for conventional mesons with parity doubling  @xcite , using heavy quark effective theory  @xcite or for @xmath25 molecules in a variety of publications  @xcite . here , we update the latter class of works , and especially identify radiative decays as the probably most promising discovery modes of the bottom - partners of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical framework and the interaction lagrangians are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : framework ] .",
    "both the isospin breaking hadronic decays and radiative decays of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 and their bottom partners are calculated in sec .",
    "[ sec : twobodydecays ] .",
    "the last section contains a brief summary .",
    "various earlier works demonstrated that both the @xmath4 and @xmath5 can straightforwardly be produced by unitarizing @xmath26 scattering amplitudes which are derived , for example , from chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) at lo  @xcite or next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite .",
    "these amplitudes were also used to calculate their strong decays . in principle , the electromagnetic decays could also be addressed with the full set of equations by gauging the integral equation  @xcite . however , since we are interested in an observable close to the resonance pole only , we can take a simpler route .",
    "first , we extract the pole residues from the full calculation , and then use these as input of a one - loop evaluation of the actual decays . for a proper field",
    "theoretical derivation of the connection between the two approaches in a different context , see sec .",
    "3.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our approach is based on the lagrangian describing the coupling of the molecules to a heavy - light meson pair in an @xmath18-wave : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denote the corresponding coupling constants .",
    "since we are only interested in the near - threshold region , a constant coupling is used for the @xmath18-wave coupling . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath4 pole was generated dynamically using unitarized nlo heavy meson - goldstone boson scattering amplitudes .",
    "the low - energy constants ( lecs ) were fit to lattice calculations for various scattering lengths .",
    "the same values of the lecs are used in this work .",
    "we here mainly present the extension of the earlier formalism necessary for this work . for more details",
    ", we refer to refs .",
    "each of the isoscalar heavy meson - kaon scattering amplitudes has a pole below threshold which corresponds to the particle of interest .",
    "the coupling constants defined in the lagrangian in eq .",
    "are then determined from the residues of these poles : @xmath29 where the uncertainties are propagated from the errors of the lecs with correlations taken into account .",
    "the couplings of the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) to the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) turn out to be larger than those to the @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "in addition , the @xmath2 channel indeed dominates over the @xmath30 channel , thanks to an enhancement by a factor of @xmath32 accordingly , applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : weinberg ] ) to the couplings in eq .",
    "( [ eq : couplingscharm ] ) , we find values of @xmath16 for both @xmath4 and @xmath5 of about @xmath33 , however , with a sizable uncertainty of the order of 50% , which comes from @xmath34 , due to the proximity of the @xmath30 channel  this provides additional evidence for the interpretation of @xmath4 and @xmath5 as predominantly molecular states .",
    "note that the mentioned large uncertainty refers to quantifying the molecular component of the scalar and axial - vector states ; the residues themselves are known to much higher accuracy , see eq .  , and it is their uncertainty that matters for the calculations below .",
    ".comparison of our predictions of the masses of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 bound states with those in refs .",
    "all masses are given in mev .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab : results_comparison ] contains the results for the individual radiative decay widths .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties given there contain various contributions , we only show the sum of all added in quadrature .",
    "the largest uncertainty stems from the chiral expansion , which is estimated by multiplying the amplitudes by @xmath37 , followed by the uncertainty of the contact term propagated from the error of the data used to fix it .",
    "smaller uncertainties come from the residues and the axial vector coupling @xmath38 , determined from the pionic decay of the @xmath39 . in the case of the latter improved experimental data on the @xmath39 width would be helpful .    in absence of experimental information , we can compare our results only to the results of previous calculations which are given in the table as well , where the values in the last two columns were based on the hadronic molecular picture of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "another result in the molecular picture was performed by gamermann et al .",
    "@xcite , using an flavor - su(4 ) lagrangian , with a width of @xmath40  kev for the @xmath41 .",
    "the results by lutz and soyeur  @xcite are the closest to ours , while other calculations generally find smaller numbers .",
    "however , the differences are not large : all results , even those from the parity - doubling model for the @xmath42 mesons  @xcite , agree with ours within two standard deviations .",
    "similarly , the values from different models in the bottom sector agree within three standard deviations .",
    "this is however only based on our uncertainties .",
    "once other models quote their residual error as well , the statistical significance of any deviation will decrease .",
    "in contrast to this , the hadronic width is enhanced significantly for molecular states due to an additional loop contribution , but here the leading contact interaction is proportional to @xmath43 and thus suppressed .",
    "consequently , calculations performed for compact @xmath42 states predict significantly smaller values . in contradistinction ,",
    "the origins of larger contributions for molecular states are the two - particle cuts in meson loops , resulting in total widths of the order of @xmath44 , and a larger coupling constant in eq .  .",
    "as can be seen in eq .  , the pure molecule sets an upper bound for @xmath16 , with an uncertainty of @xmath45 . in principle",
    ", the @xmath21 meson loops can also contribute to the width of the @xmath42 mesons .",
    "however , the coupling constant would be much smaller since @xmath46 for such states .",
    "similar to the charm sector , all values in the bottom sector from different models agree within three standard deviations , and less when the hitherto - unknown uncertainties of other models are considered .",
    "we presented hadronic and radiative decay widths of the charm - strange resonances @xmath0 and @xmath1 under the assumption that they are @xmath21 bound states .",
    "our results are in fair agreement with available data . in detail , the decay widths are larger by more than one order of magnitude for the isospin violating hadronic decays than for the radiative decays : the hadronic widths are around 100  kev while the radiative ones are of the order of a few kev .",
    "our analysis revealed that only the hadronic decays are sensitive to a possible molecular component of both the @xmath4 and @xmath5 a hadronic width of 100 kev or larger can be regarded as a unique feature for molecular states .",
    "this experimental accuracy could possibly be reached with @xmath47anda at the future accelerator facility fair .",
    "the origin of this enhanced width is the presence of two - meson cuts and the large coupling constant of the molecules to their constitutents  those should be much smaller in for non - molecular states .",
    "in contrast to this , the radiative decays turn out to be similar in size for all models for the states of interest . from the effective field theory point of view , this can be understood by the presence of a counterterm at lo , which is of short - distance nature , in these decays .",
    "we also made predictions for their heavy flavor partners in the open bottom sector .",
    "larger binding energies lead to much reduced hadronic widths .",
    "since the radiative decay widths are much larger than those of the strong decays , radiative decays appear to be the most promising discovery channels for these positive parity bottom - strange mesons in future experiments .",
