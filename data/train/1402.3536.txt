    "there have recently been various improvements in the pdf determinations by the various groups ( see e.g. @xcite ) generally making the predictions using different pdf sets more consistent with each other .",
    "however , there still remain some large differences which are occasionally much bigger than the individual pdf uncertainties @xcite .",
    "this is particularly the case for cross sections depending on the high-@xmath0 gluon or on higher powers of the strong coupling constant @xmath6 . in this article",
    "i investigate potential reasons for these differences , based on alternative theoretical procedures that can be chosen for a pdf fit .",
    "the two main potential sources of differences which may affect rather generic features such as the general form of the gluon distribution and the preferred value of @xmath1 , ( rather than more detailed features such as quark flavour decomposition ) , are the choice of active flavour number used and whether or not higher twist corrections are applied to theory calculations , and related to this whether low @xmath4 and @xmath2 data are used in a pdf fit .",
    "i discover that the issue of heavy flavours is by far the more important of these , and explain the reason why the differences between pdfs obtained using fixed flavour number scheme ( ffns ) and those using a general mass variable flavour number scheme ( gm - vfns ) is so great at finite order in perturbative qcd .",
    "this study builds on some initial results in @xcite and in many senses is similar to the nnpdf study in @xcite and reaches broadly the same conclusions .",
    "however , there are a variety of differences to the nnpdf study , not least the investigation of the @xmath6 dependence , and also a much more detailed discussion of the theoretical understanding of the conclusions .",
    "a very brief summary of the results here have been presented in @xcite .",
    "i first examine the number of active quark flavours used in the calculation of structure functions .",
    "there are essentially two different choices for how one deals with the charm and bottom quark contributions , the former being of distinct phenomenological importance as the charm contribution to the total @xmath7 at hera can be of order @xmath8 .",
    "hence , i will concentrate on the charm contribution to structure functions @xmath9 , but all theoretical considerations are the same for the bottom quark contribution . in the @xmath10 fixed flavour number scheme ( ffns )",
    "we always have @xmath11 i.e. for @xmath12 massive quarks are only created in the final state .",
    "this is exact ( up to nonperturbative corrections ) but does not sum @xmath13 terms in the perturbative expansion .",
    "the ffns has long been fully known at nlo @xcite , but this is not yet the case at nnlo ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "approximate results can be derived @xcite , and are sometimes used in fits , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , it turns out that these nnlo corrections are not actually very large , except near threshold and at very low @xmath0 , being generally of order @xmath15 or less away from these regimes .",
    "( perhaps surprisingly , the approximate nnlo corrections also do not reduce the scale dependence by much compared to nlo , see e.g. figs .",
    "12 and 13 of @xcite . )",
    "hence , the use of approximate nnlo corrections to @xmath9 has not led to significant changes compared to nnlo pdfs which used the simpler approximation of only going to nlo in @xmath9 , e.g @xcite .     using the ffns and gm - vfns at lo , nlo and nnlo .",

    "pdfs in different number regions are related perturbatively , @xmath19 where the perturbative matrix elements @xmath20 are known exactly to nlo @xcite . in @xcite . ]",
    "the original zero mass variable flavour number scheme ( zm - vfns ) ignores all @xmath21 corrections in cross sections , i.e. for structure functions @xmath22 but this is an approximation at low @xmath4 .",
    "the majority of pdf groups use a general - mass variable flavour number scheme ( gm - vfns ) .",
    "this is designed to take one from the well - defined limits of @xmath23 where the ffns description applies to @xmath24 where the variable flavour number description is more applicable in a well defined theoretical manner .",
    "some of the variants are reviewed and compared in @xcite , and for specific examples see e.g. @xcite there is an ambiguity in precisely how one defines a gm - vfns at fixed order in perturbation theory ( in the same way there is a renormalisation and factorisation scale uncertainty ) , but this is always formally higher order than that at which one is working .",
    "a study of the variation of both @xmath9 and extracted pdfs was made in @xcite , and both reduced significantly at nnlo .",
    "pdfs and predictions for lhc cross sections could vary by amounts of order the experimental pdf uncertainty at nlo , i.e. @xmath25 but this reduced to generally fractions of a percent at nnlo . in both cases there was little variation in the preferred values of @xmath1 .",

    "for ffns at nnlo only nlo coefficient functions are used , but ( various choices of ) approximate @xmath14 corrections give only small increases that would not change the plots in any qualitative manner .",

    "in fact at nlo the ffns dis data only fit gives a slightly better fit to the dis data than the full higher twist mstw2008 fit .",

    "higher twist fits the nuclear target inclusive dis data is omitted and no higher twist corrections applied below @xmath31.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ] . in the ffns plus higher twist fits the nuclear target inclusive dis data is omitted and no higher twist corrections applied below @xmath31.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    although the value of @xmath1 obtained from the ffns fits with higher twist corrections is generally lower than that obtained in the gm - vfns fits , particularly at nnlo , it is not as low as that obtained by other pdf groups which perform fits using the ffns , e.g. @xcite . in the latter of these",
    "there is sensitivity to the input scale of the pdfs , with values of @xmath32 lower than @xmath33 leading to lower values of @xmath1 .",
    "i do not investigate this possibility since the mstw pdf parameterisation is already such as to make the input gluon distribution rather different at any low scale .",
    "however , another difference in these fits compared to mstw2008 is the absence of nuclear target inclusive structure function data @xcite which are dependent on nuclear corrections , but where the non - singlet @xmath34 data do favour high @xmath1 values , as shown in @xcite .",
    "also in many higher twist studies the higher twist corrections are only included for @xmath35 hence , i perform ffns fits which restrict the higher twist from the three lowest @xmath0 bins and simultaneously omit the less theoretically clean nuclear target data ( except for dimuon cross sections , which constrain the strange quark ) .",
    "this results a series of fits labelled ht*. the fit quality for fits to only dis data , dis plus drell yan data and with the addition of tevatron jet data and tevatron @xmath36 rapidity data is shown in tables [ tab : t4 ] and [ tab : t5 ] .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in these tables the @xmath30 for dis data does not include that for the nuclear target data , although the data has been included in the fits except for those labelled ht*. removal of these data generally allow a slight improvement to the rest of the data , but this is compensated for by a ( usually slightly larger ) deterioration when the higher twist below @xmath31 is removed . as well as the ffns fits",
    "i also show the fit quality for a gm - vfns fit with @xmath1 fixed to the same value as the full mstw2008 higher twist fit , but the same data as the ffns dis plus drell yan fit is used .",
    "this is labelled mstw2008ht*. for this approach the fit quality for the dis plus drell yan data is the best exhibited , and the prediction for the tevatron jets is quite good .",
    "the pdfs for the fits containing dis plus fixed target drell yan data are compared to mstw2008 for two variants of the ffns fit in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] and the full range of ht * fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the additional changes in the ht * fits do result in slightly lower values of @xmath1 , particularly at nnlo , with values of @xmath6 of @xmath37 at nlo and @xmath38 at nnlo for the fits without tevatron data .",
    "these are very close to those in @xcite , where the ffns scheme choice , data types , and form of higher twist ( and the resulting pdfs ) are similar .",
    "the change in the pdfs in going from the ffns fits to ffnsht * fits is not large at all , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , with the essential features of the differences between ffns and gm - vfns pdfs being fully maintained .",
    "i have also made some further checks on the general validity of the results .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that when using the default gm - vfns for the mstw2008 fit the best fit quality was obtained for values of the pole mass @xmath39 different to the default @xmath40 . at nlo",
    "the global @xmath30 could decrease by just a couple of units with a very slightly larger value @xmath41 , but at nnlo the global @xmath30 could decrease by 24 units if the lower value of @xmath42 is used . in the ffns fits a very slight decrease in @xmath30 of a few units is obtained at nlo if @xmath39 lowers by @xmath43 or less and at nnlo an improvement in @xmath30 of up to 30 units can be achieved for @xmath44-@xmath45 .",
    "hence , the improvements in fit quality possible using the gm - vfns and ffns are very similar , perhaps marginally better for ffns , and ffns prefers a slight lower optimum @xmath39 value .",
    "none of this has any significant effect on the relative differences in pdfs or @xmath1 .",
    "also , as demonstrated in section 3 , the differences between ffns and gm - vfns can be very largely understood in terms of the leading @xmath18 terms in the perturbative expansions .",
    "these are completely unaltered by a change in quark mass scheme of @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , there is only a fairly minor change in pdfs from @xcite to @xcite , and almost no change in @xmath1 , despite the change from the pole mass to @xmath47 mass schemes .",
    "perhaps the most striking change , an increase in sea quarks near @xmath31 is due to the inclusion of the combined hera data @xcite , an effect noticed elsewhere , e.g. @xcite . as a final check",
    ", fits were performed using approximations to the full nnlo heavy flavour dis coefficients .",
    "wider variations in coefficient functions were allowed than options @xmath48 and @xmath49 in @xcite .",
    "at best the nnlo ffns fits improved quality by about 40 - 50 units - significant but still leaving them some way from the gm - vfns fit quality at nnlo .",
    "the change in pdfs and @xmath1 is never very large , and the very best fits actually preferred a marginally lower @xmath1 value .",
    "hence , the conclusions on fit quality , the pdf shape and @xmath1 values are stable under a variety of variation in the full details of the fit . the general features of the ffns fits producing gluon distributions which are about @xmath15 lower at @xmath50 at @xmath51 than when using gm - vfns , but rising to @xmath52 ( or more ) greater below @xmath31 , along with a light quark distribution which is a few percent bigger at most @xmath0 values seems to be largely insensitive to any other variations in procedure or data fit .",
    "the reduction of @xmath1 also seems to be a stable feature , but the precise difference is more sensitive to details of the fit .",
    "finally , in order to investigate why the value of @xmath1 obtained in ffns fits is lower than in gm - vfns fits i also perform a nnlo fit to dis and low - energy dy data where @xmath1 is fixed to the higher value obtained in the gm - vfns .",
    "i also perform a fit with @xmath53 at nlo , though the relative change in the coupling is less significant at nlo .",
    "this fixed coupling results in the ffns gluon being a little closer to that using gm - vfns , as shown at nnlo in fig .  [ fig11 ] for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and very similar to the gluon in @xcite , where studies are performed with fixed @xmath1 .",
    "there is little change in the light quarks in the ffns fit when the coupling is held fixed .",
    "the fit quality is shown in tables [ tab : t4 ] and [ tab : t5 ] the ffns fit is 8 units worse when @xmath56 than for 0.1136 .",
    "( the deterioration at nlo is very slightly less . )",
    "the fit to hera data is better , but it is worse for fixed target data .     ( blue ) to the mstw2008 pdfs at @xmath57 ( left ) and at @xmath58 ( right ) . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]   ( blue ) to the mstw2008 pdfs at @xmath57 ( left ) and at @xmath58 ( right ) .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    [ fig11 ]    by examining the change in the gluon in the ffns fit when @xmath1 is fixed one can understand the need for @xmath6 to be smaller in ffns . to compensate for smaller @xmath26 at @xmath27",
    "the ffns gluon must be bigger in this region , and from the momentum sum rule , is therefore smaller at high @xmath0 .",
    "the correlation between the high-@xmath0 gluon and @xmath1 when fitting high-@xmath0 fixed target dis data drives @xmath6 down ( for reduced gluon the quarks fall with @xmath4 more quickly , hence the need to lower @xmath6 to slow evolution ) , requiring the small @xmath0 gluon to even bigger . as",
    "the fit undergoes iterations this pattern is repeated until the best fit is reached with a lower @xmath1 value and significantly modified gluon shape .",
    "in this article i have investigated whether the different theoretical choices in fits to data in order to determine partons distribution functions ( pdfs ) can influence the pdfs , the value of @xmath1 and the fit quality .",
    "i come to the strong conclusion that within the context of the mstw2008 global fit the choice of a ffns for heavy flavour production in deep inelastic scattering , as opposed to a gm - vfns , leads to a lower @xmath1 , a gluon distribution which is much lower at very high-@xmath0 but smaller at small @xmath0 , and larger light quarks over most @xmath0 values .",
    "in contrast , making the @xmath4 and @xmath2 cuts on the data less conservative and introducing higher twist corrections which are fit to the data makes little difference to pdfs , except at very high @xmath0 and also little difference to @xmath1 , particularly at nnlo .",
    "this result concerning the importance of the choice of heavy flavour scheme used might seem surprising .",
    "it is known that the ffns and a well - defined gm - vfns will converge towards each other as the perturbative order is increased . at higher orders more and more large logs in @xmath59",
    "are included in the ffns and the ambiguities in the gm - vfns definition near threshold are shifted to higher and higher order .",
    "indeed , it has often been suggested , e.g. @xcite , that the omission of tevatron jet data is the likely source of the smallness of the high-@xmath0 gluon in some pdf sets .",
    "this is undoubtedly partially true .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] of this article that when fitting using ffns the inclusion of jet data raises the gluon for @xmath60 and @xmath1 ( in @xcite top pair production cross sections are raised when tevatron jet data is included ) .",
    "however , gm - vfns fits without jet data do not automatically have a lower high-@xmath0 gluon or @xmath61 value - it is simply that constraints on both are loosened .",
    "for example , it is not really clear why for the herapdf1.5 pdfs in @xcite , which fit hera dis data only , the nnlo high-@xmath0 gluon is harder than nlo .",
    "hence , the inclusion of jet data or not is only part of reason for significant pdf differences . it has also been argued , e.g. @xcite , that it is the absence of nnlo corrections to jet production that leads to differences in the gluon in different pdf sets at nnlo , i.e. the nnlo high-@xmath0 gluon is being overestimated due to missing positive nnlo corrections .",
    "i find this unconvincing . in the mstw2008",
    "fits threshold corrections of @xmath62 from @xcite are used in nnlo fits .",
    "it was shown recently @xcite that the absence of jet radius @xmath63 dependence in these terms leads to an underestimate of the full nlo result in the threshold approximation of @xcite .",
    "however , improved threshold calculations in @xcite shown little @xmath63 dependence at nnlo , and the size of corrections at nnlo inferred from @xcite is quite similar to that used in mstw fits .",
    "additionally , in @xcite extreme changes in the assumed nnlo corrections for tevatron jets are considered and changes in pdfs and @xmath1 are considerably smaller than those seen from changing the flavour scheme in this article .",
    "hopefully a full nnlo calculation of jet cross sections @xcite will settle this dispute soon .",
    "furthermore , the issue of nnlo jet cross sections only affects nnlo pdfs , and the general features of the differences between different pdf sets are all very similar at nlo and at nnlo , so attributing them to effects unique to nnlo seems rather unlikely to be correct .    in fact",
    "the study in this article began at nlo in @xcite , where significant differences between ffns and gm - vfns was seen . as well as building on the phenomenological results of this initial study by showing a similar effect is indeed present at nnlo , and is consistent with results comparing ffns and gm - vfns in @xcite and @xcite , this article shows exactly why this effect exists by studying the form of the leading logarithmic contribution to @xmath64 in ffns and gm - vfns .",
    "it is shown in section 3 that one can understand exactly why evolution at high @xmath4 is considerably slower in ffns than in gm - vfns for @xmath28 , and that the difference between the two will only converge at very high perturbative order .",
    "this has an important impact on the fit to inclusive dis data since there is a very large amount of @xmath7 hera data at high @xmath4 for @xmath65 , and @xmath26 is a large contribution to this .",
    "since the charm contribution in ffns is lower at high-@xmath4",
    "it is clear that light quarks will be higher to compensate .",
    "the change in the gluon and @xmath1 is less obvious , but an argument for their form is put forward in section 5 .",
    "hence , i conclude that the use of gm - vfns and ffns will result in significantly different pdfs and @xmath1 up to nnlo , whereas higher twist corrections are not important so long as their absence is accompanied by sufficiently high cuts on @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "the difference between ffns and gm - vfns pdfs will be moderated as the fit becomes more global and more data types are added , but the fit quality seems to be better using a gm - vfns and less tension between different data sets is observed . indeed ,",
    "pdfs which are obtained using a gm - vfns are already seen to match lhc jet data very well @xcite .",
    "additionally , one may feel that if there is slow convergence of a expansion which contains finite orders of @xmath66 to the result of a fully resummed series of these terms then it is theoretically preferable to use the latter .",
    "therefore , i advocate the use of a gm - vfns in pdf fits to data .",

    "<S> i first consider using the 3-flavour fixed flavour number scheme instead of the standard general mass variable flavour number scheme used in the mstw analysis . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the light quarks increasing at all relatively small @xmath0 values , the gluon distribution becoming smaller at high values of @xmath0 and larger at small @xmath0 , the preferred value of the coupling constant @xmath1 falling , particularly at nnlo , and the fit quality deteriorates . </S>",
    "<S> i also consider lowering the kinematic cut on @xmath2 for dis data and simultaneously introducing higher twist terms which are fit to data . </S>",
    "<S> this results in much smaller effects on both pdfs and @xmath1 than the scheme change , except for quarks at very high @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> i show that the structure function one obtains from a fixed input set of pdfs using the fixed flavour scheme and variable flavour scheme differ significantly for @xmath3 at high @xmath4 , and that this is due to the fact that in the fixed flavour scheme there is a slow convergence of large logarithmic terms of the form @xmath5 relevant for this regime . </S>",
    "<S> i conclude that some of the most significant differences in pdf sets are largely due to the choice of flavour scheme used .    </S>",
