    "the production of the @xmath6 is also expected from magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transitions  @xcite of the @xmath4 , and @xmath0 with @xmath18 has previously been observed by besiii  @xcite .",

    "@xmath4 mesons are produced by the annihilation of electron - positron pairs at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath19 mev .",
    "the production of the @xmath6 through a radiative transition from the @xmath4 requires a charmed - quark spin - flip and , thus , proceeds via a m1 transition . some of the generated @xmath6 mesons will decay into hadrons , and then ultimately into detectable particles , like pions , kaons , and photons .",
    "we study the decay exclusively by reconstructing the @xmath6 from its hadronic decay products and analyze the @xmath6 candidate mass for an evidence of @xmath0 .",
    "the experimental challenge of the measurement of this decay channel is to detect the 48  mev radiative photons in an experimental environment with considerable backgrounds , therefore the success of this study depends on a careful and detailed analysis of all possible background sources .",
    "the data sample for this analysis consists of @xmath20 events produced at the peak of the @xmath4 resonance  @xcite .",
    "data were collected with an additional integrated luminosity of 42  pb@xmath21 at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath22=3.65  gev to determine non - resonant continuum background contributions .",

    "the momentum resolution of the charged particles is @xmath25% at @xmath26 in a 1  tesla magnetic field . the energy loss ( @xmath27 ) measurement provided by the mdc has a resolution better than 6% for electrons from bhabha scattering",

    "a charged track should have good quality in the track fitting and be within the angle coverage of the mdc , @xmath37 . a good charged track ( excluding those from @xmath38 decays )",
    "is required to pass within 1  cm of the @xmath23 annihilation interaction point ( ip ) in the transverse direction to the beam line and within 10  cm of the ip along the beam axis .",
    "charged - particle identification ( pid ) is based on combining the @xmath27 and tof information to the variable @xmath39 .",
    "the values @xmath40 and the corresponding confidence levels @xmath41 are calculated for each charged track for each particle hypothesis @xmath42 ( pion , kaon , or proton ) .",
    "photon candidates are required to have energy greater than 25  @xmath43 in the emc both for the barrel region ( @xmath44 ) and the endcap region ( @xmath45 ) . in order to improve the reconstruction efficiency and the energy resolution ,",
    "the energy deposited in the nearby tof counter is included .",

    "other backgrounds include @xmath72 with a missing photon and initial state radiation ( isr ) .",
    "the phase space process @xmath73 has the same final states as our signal , so it should be considered as an irreducible background . as discussed in a later section , the size of this irreducible background is estimated using a region of @xmath74 mass away from the @xmath6 mass .    in the @xmath71 background with a fake photon , a peak could be produced in the @xmath74 mass spectrum close to the expected @xmath6 mass with a sharp cutoff due to the 25 mev photon energy threshold . considering that the fake photon does not contribute useful information to the kinematic fit",
    ", we set the photon energy free in the kinematic fit to avoid the mass distortion caused by the 25 mev photon energy threshold .",
    "we call this the 3c kinematic fit and produce the mass spectrum based on it .",
    "mc studies demonstrate that with the 3c kinematic fit , the energy of the fake photon tends to zero , which is helpful in separating the signal from the fake photon background , as shown in fig  [ fig:3c ]  @xcite .         in the other @xmath75 background",

    "these can describe the @xmath99 spectrum well in the collider data after applying the kinematic fit correction  @xcite .",
    "the line shape for @xmath6 produced by such a m1 transition is given by : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the breit - wigner function , @xmath102 is the invariant mass of @xmath103 , @xmath104 is the energy of the transition photon in the rest frame of @xmath4 , @xmath105 is the function to damp the diverging tail raised by @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the gaussian function describing the detector resolution .",
    "the detector resolution is determined by the mc study , and the difference of data and mc has been taken into account which introduces negligible uncertainties in branching fraction , mass and width measurements comparing with other factors .",
    "the form of the damping function is somewhat arbitrary , and one suitable function used by kedr  @xcite for a similar process is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the peaking energy of the transition photon .",
